<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO the benign and God loving Reader or Hear∣er who might see this, and to you my dear Friends, wishing from my heart, that each who should read this, to give ear to it with an impartial heart and mind it. This Treatise, which I have drawn in my simpleness, treating in the first place of the written Word of GOD, against all those, who reject the old and new Testament, or do not con∣fess it to be the word of the Almighty, which was received and confessed from all ages, by all holy men and children of God, to be the true and everlasting Word; which word as our Saviour says, will judge us in the last day. I have told you my dear friends also my opinion, about the christian Baptism with water, and something of the peaceable Kingdom of CHRIST. I wish from all my heart, that you my dear friends, and all who should see it, not to be of∣fended, at this my Treatise, or to speak scornfully of it, but to examine it well, and judge of it with an impartial heart, and to prove it well on the touch∣stone of the word of God, for the council of the Al∣mighty will stand, for he that rejecteth me, and receiv∣ed not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, will judge him in the last day, and the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, "The Lord knoweth them that are his, nobo∣dy can lay another foundation, save that which was laid by Jesus Christ."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends and Readers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LOVING you with a divine love, I wish you and me and to all mankind, that the eternal creator and preserver of all things, may pour out his fatherly spirit over us all, that we poor sheep who go astray in the wilderness of this world, may be led and guided by him, to the excellent pasture of his word, and to be fed with the true bread of life, that our souls may live. But perceiving from your Publications, that you Quakers, (for conscience∣sake, or your consciences being so delicate) do not confess the books of the written word, to be the word of God. Therefore, I would give you to un∣derstand by this my simple epistle, since I confess it to be the true word of God; as I hope to shew by the divine grace, beseeching each and every one of my readers, that they might read this with an impar∣tial heart, and to weigh it on the balance of the word of God, and on the testimony of the Prophets, Je∣sus Christ and his Apostles, who have made us known the will of the Almighty, whether it is inconsistent with holy writ. Hear and understand, you who think your consciences to be so tender, that you would not take the written word, which you call the holy Writ, for the word of God. Therefore dear friends give ear, what the man of faith Moses has spoken from the mouth of the Almighty, who has made heaven and earth, and all that is in it, when he begins thus:—<HI>In the beginning</HI> God <HI>created the heaven and earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: <PB N="5" REF="045885_0005_10207B01D136DC40"/>and the spirit of</HI> God <HI>moved upon the face of the waters,</HI> Genesis 1, 1. 2. Here my dear friends you may hear, and God said, ah! dear-bought souls, what was it that the Almighty said? He the eternal crea∣tor and builder of all things, has said, "Let there be light:" and there was light; from whom came the written and conceiving word, must we poor creatures not all confess with Moses, that it was spok∣en by the Almighty, as king David confesses in his XXXIII. <HI>Psalm,</HI> 6 verse. <HI>By the word of the Lord was the heavens made: and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</HI> Hear farther, what the creator of all things has spoken, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the wa∣ters from the waters," whose word was it, that came from the eternal creator, whereby he has made all things? I hope we must confess with all saints, that it is the eternal word of the Almighty, which was before the creation in the creator and in the godhead, and which at his time, by the same divine and spok∣en word came from the father of lights, it is the everlasting essential word of God, whereby every thing that is in heaven and on earth, in the sea and under the earth was created and made; therefore con∣tinue reading, in the said first chapter, and I am sure you will find by the grace of God, that it was utter∣ed and spoken by the mouth of the Lord, so that it could not be called otherwise, at the time it was not written yet, as the word of God. But since his will and his divine word which he has spoken, should be known unto man, he has laid open his council will and his spoken word and commandments unto mankind, since he has endowed man, above all other created beings with an immortal soul, there∣sore <PB N="6" REF="045885_0006_10207AC10BEFA230"/>he has revealed him his will and law. Now tell me dear friends, was it not the Almighty, who spoke the words, saying, <HI>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not ear of it: for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</HI> Was it not spoken by the Almighty? O! without doubt, it was the word and commandment, which our first parents have transgressed, through deceit of the ser∣pent, and Adam and his posterity fell thereby into eternal misery, death and damnation. So that God has found means and has given Adam the promise, on which Adam with all saints has put his hope and trust, well knowing that what God promises, he will and can bring about, being a God of truth and without falshood. Consider farther what God said to Noah, and the Lord said, <HI>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.</HI> And God said unto Abraham, <HI>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee.</HI> Here we can see, how the Lord God has spoken with Adam, Noah and Abraham. Who would be so daring and bold as to say, that it was not the Lord who spoke it; except that the Lord has revealed them his word by means of the angels, or by dreams, or by his divine voice as with Adam, or that the Almighty has made them known his word and will, by his everlasting spirit. Ah! dear children, if the Almighty manifests him∣self in and within us in such a manner, and reveals us his word, would it not be absurd to tell him in face, that it was not his word, would we not be guilty like Adam. The Lord having manifested him∣self before the law was given, as was shewn with <PB N="7" REF="045885_0007_10207B036DC3A708"/>Adam and the family of Seth, with Noah, Abraham and Lot, and with many others, so they have receiv∣ed it as the true and perfect word from the mouth of the Almighty, and have put their hope and trust therein and were contented, well knowing, that what he promises, he can and will bring it about. But since the law was given us by means of the angels, and made known by Moses in his writings, and it being sprung from the Almighty and given to man by angels. Therefore give ear what the Lord him∣self said about his word: <HI>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might; and these words which I com∣mand thee this day, shall be in thine heart.</HI> Here we may see what the true man Moses testifies of the word of God, how strongly he indicates it to his people, when he said, "And the Lord spake with you in the mount, out of the midst of fire, you have heard his voice, and he revealed you his Covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten command∣ments, and he wrote them on two tables of stone." Since the Lord has let hear his voice, to his people on mount Horeb, and has brought his word before their ears, and has wrote it himself, how should we poor mortals be so daring, to bend and stretch it, or to say because it was wrote, that it is not the word of the Lord, it being brought to us, from God's own mouth, and he himself has made it manifest, by Moses and by all his holy Prophets, as he says: <HI>I will raise them a Prophet, from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them, all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not <PB N="8" REF="045885_0008_10207AC295A86F00"/>hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him.</HI> Hear farther how the true servant Samuel, in his first book the 15 chap∣ter, calls it the word of the Lord, when he said. <HI>Now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord,</HI> when he commanded Saul to destroy Amalek; but Saul transgressed the word of the Lord: then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying, It repenteth me, that I have set up Saul to be king: But Samuel rebuked Saul for it and told him, "that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee." Who dare say without injuring his conscience, that the citations from holy writ abovementioned, which Moses, God Almighty himself, Samuel, Abraham and all men of God have lest us, that they have not confessed it to be, the everlasting word of God; as the Prophet Jeremiah in his 2 Chapter said: <HI>Hear ye the Word of the Lord,</HI> and in his 7 chapter the Lord commandeth him, to stand in the gate of the Lord's house, and to proclaim there this word, and say, <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah,</HI> and in his 16 chapter, <HI>the word of the Lord came also unto me.</HI> This shews clear, how this man of God has spoken it as the word of God, also Ezekiel, in his 6, 7, 12, 13 and 15 chapter, there you will find it confessed for the true word of God. The Prophet Daniel in his 9th chapter, the 9, 10, 11 and 12 verse, as we may read in the said 12th verse, testifies it to be the same, and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us; also Hosea, the first chapter, <HI>and this is the word of the Lord,</HI> likewise in his 4th chapter; Joel the 1st. chapter, <HI>the word of <PB N="9" REF="045885_0009_10207B06470DDCC8"/>the Lord came to Joel.</HI> Amos in his fifth chapter, <HI>Hear ye this word, which I take up against you, O house of Israel.</HI> Jonah the 1st. chapter 1st. verse, now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah, saying, Micah first chapter, 1st. verse, <HI>the word of the Lord came to me:</HI> again Zephaniah it is called the word of the LORD, and Zachariah 1st. chapter, 1 verse, <HI>the word of the Lord came unto me;</HI> and Sirach said, <HI>the word of the most high, is the fountain of Wisdom, and the everlasting commandment is their source, and a wise man puts his pleasure to learn the word of God, blessed is he that searcheth the word of God, and teach∣es it.</HI></P>
<P>I have cited above many passages from the old tes∣tament, how they have all confessed it to be the word of God; but as some may stand up, and might say, that it was the word of the spirit, since they had spoken it, by the holy Ghost, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> saith, <HI>that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private in∣terpretation. For the prophecy came not in old times, by the will of man: but holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the holy Ghost.</HI> Therefore it is my real opinion, that they have spoken it by the holy Ghost, and it being manifested from time to time by the spirit of God, so it is indisputable, since God and his spirit are one in the Godhead; or as our Saviour faith in his word, <HI>God is a spirit: and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</HI> Therefore I trust entirely in the Almighty, that he has not deceived these dear instruments, in not having filled and moved them by his eternal spi∣rit in such a manner, that they broke out in so many places: "hear the word of the Lord," and have preached it so manyfold to the disobedient people. <PB N="10" REF="045885_0010_10207AC573A74440"/>Therefore I shall put the question to each and every sensible man, whose word they have set forth, since they have spoken nothing, as what the Almighty has revealed them, by his eternal spirit. You will con∣fess undoubtedly, that if it was spoken out or from God or by his eternal spirit, that it is the everlast∣ing essential word of God, which these holy men have written, and God himself. So that this word has received the high name of the holy Writ. Holy since it sprung from the Almighty himself, and was set forth by the holy Ghost, from the mouth of the Prophets and Apostles. WRIT, it being written and set down by so many faithful men of God, so that it may be termed <HI>the holy Writ.</HI> Dear friends, where∣as you teach and confess, that the written word of God, is not the word of God, but only the holy writ and the word of the spirit, which manifests it∣self in our souls, that it is the quickening word. Therefore, my dear children! I must bring this question home to all and every one of you, whose word it is, that you preach, when the same spirit of the eternal father, moves, presses and drives you, and makes your tongues fiery, so that you by the pressing power of the spirit of God, teach, speak and manifest unto all men, the word and will of God? as Moses and the Almighty, and all Prophets and Saints have preached, by the eternal spirit of God, and have it all from time to time, confessed and spo∣ken as the word of God, as I have shewn heretofore by many quotations from scripture; I could cite more passages, but to prevent much writings, I shall refer the benign Reader to their own publications, there they will find enough. Such a great number of children of God, having taken it, in so many places for the <PB N="11" REF="045885_0011_10207B0973031500"/>word of the Lord; I must ask you once more, whose word it is, that nothing is spoken with you, as what the holy spirit says; will you say, it is not the word of the Lord, that you preach, I must tell you that you err, and dare say with the Prophet, <HI>How do ye say, we are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the Scribes is in vain. The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?</HI> or as he farther saith, by the mouth of the Prophet; <HI>he that hath my word, let speak my word faithfully: What is the chaff to the wheat?</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Is not my word like as fire?</HI> saith the Lord; <HI>and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces; but if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</HI> But if you will say, that it is the word and will of God you preach or reveal, I must tell, that it is impossible that the Spirit of God, or God himself should have erred so far, as to think himself too clean, just and good, to call it the word of God, which the Almigh∣ty from all ages has spoken by his Spirit; this is con∣trary to all scripture of the old and new testament. Our Saviour had greatly mistaken himself, when he saith, <HI>They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them,</HI> and again, <HI>till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle, shall in nowise pass from the law;</HI> and the Lord saith, <HI>Ye shall not add unto the word which I com∣mand you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it.</HI> I have quoted many passages from the old testament, how the Lord God himself has spoken by his Spirit through the holy prophets, and has stiled it his word, <PB N="12" REF="045885_0012_10207AC9A493BD30"/>or his will, law and commandment. There you may see my dear friends, with what excellent name the word of God was styled before it was written; therefore I shall quote you some testimonies from the new testament, where our Saviour Jesus Christ him∣self teaches, when he called us unto repentance and to believe in the gospel: this word of the gospel is the good tidings of the Almighty father, which no patriarch, nor prophet or other saint could bring us, but it has cost the word of the Almighty, whereby he made all things, the eternal word of God, which was from eternity with the father and in God. Yea, it required that God himself came, when the time was accomplished, into flesh, to take away the enmi∣ty and to announce unto all men these good tidings, of which Adam under the law and all prophets have prophesied in so many places; but none of them could bring us this perfect good tiding, but it requi∣red the man from the tribe of Judah, who has brought us the same by his free grace, from the high throne of his divine majesty. On this good tiding of the divine grace have hoped all good children of God. But whereas you (for conscience-sake) deny the writ∣ten word and the everlasting peace of God, the gos∣pel time, which was brought to us by no mortal man, but the son or the word of the almighty Fa∣ther, has brought it to us from heaven, as his father's word and will. This gospel-word of the almighty Creator, my dear friends, was with the godhead, which was manifested as well under the law as by all prophets, as a ray of the divine light, till the Son of God as the perfect lawgiver, has preached the gos∣pel of the peace, and has called it in many places the word of God, as we may read, <HI>If a man love me, <PB N="13" REF="045885_0013_10207B0AF8A290D0"/>he will keep my words: verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life.</HI> Here you will see my dear friends, how our Saviour repeats verily, <HI>he that heareth my word;</HI> but whole word, ah! undoubt∣edly the gospel-word, which he has brought from heaven, but the Godhead dwelling perfectly in him, he saith farther, <HI>and believeth on him that sent me.</HI> There my dear friends we may see, how he called his doctrine his word; since the father dwelleth in him, so the heavenly father has spoken out or through his dear child, which is and was his word. This gos∣pel-word is flown from the Father through the mouth of Christ; <HI>and in this word saith our Saviour, shall we believe, that we might live thereby.</HI> And again he saith, <HI>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me;</HI> he teaches moreover, <HI>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. I am not come to judge, but the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him, in the last day. Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings: and the word which you hear, is not mine, but the father's which sent me: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</HI> There my dear friends you see, how Christ, the son of the living God, who was with God and in God, by whom all things were made, the fountain of all, the king and ruler of the universe, the high and eter∣nal God, was not ashamed, nor thought it below his dignity, to call his doctrine his word, and this <PB N="14" REF="045885_0014_10207ACC7ADB90E0"/>in so many places, and has given the word he has spoken, divine honor, that he should not judge, but the word, that he has spoken. Therefore I confess it also, with Jesus Christ, with the Almighty, with Moses, with all prophets and children of God, that it is the law, word and commandment of the most high God, which all true children of God, were bound to keep, without adding or diminishing it. Therefore I must ask each and every one of you whose word and commandment it was, that Adam trans∣gressed, without doubt the word of the eternal cre∣ator which he pronounced: <HI>For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</HI> Whose word was it that the children of Israel have transgressed, that they all fell in the wilderness. Tell me whose word it was, that the Almighty spoke on mount Si∣nai, and which he has written on two tables of stone, was it not the commandment and word of the Almigh∣ty? which he has given them by Moses, that they might know and understand, how they should serve the Al∣mighty, and in this law he has commanded them, <HI>If you will set a king over you, in the land where I shall bring thee, the book of the law shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand or to the left.</HI> Dear friends, it was this commandment that Ahab aud all Israel have set aside and worshipped the idols. Whose word and com∣mandment was it that Saul has transgressed? Was it not the word and commandment of the most High, given him by Samuel? Whose commandment was it, that Manasseh and his people have transgressed when they sacrificed their children to the devils, and adored all hosts of heaven? and have rejected the will <PB N="15" REF="045885_0015_10207B0CC2D97248"/>of the Almighty, the book of the law, which was given through Moses from the mouth of the Almigh∣ty. Was it not the commandment of God that Je∣robeam and Israel broke, when he made two calves of gold, that the man of God, through the word of the Lord, prophesied against him and the altar in Bethel? Whose word was it, that the man of God has transgressed, when the false prophet persuadeth him to turn back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water? Has not David sinned against the word of God by instigation of Satan, when he out of pride got the people numbered, he has al∣so transgressed the word of the Lord, when he com∣mitted adultery with the wife of Uriah, and got him slain by the sword of the Ammonites? Whose word was it, which Nathan said unto David, was it Na∣than's word or the Lord's? O! certainly it was the word of the Lord. Therefore look and read the holy prophets through, and there you will find, that they have been always a disobedient house or people, and how the Almighty, so many times and in so many places, has called, threatned and warned them by his prophets; that they might return from their wicked∣ness, and commandeth them to keep his law strictly; which prophecies, God the Almighty father, in so many and various places, calls, pronounces and pro∣fesses himself to be his word, that if we only should read it, we would be sufficiently convinced, that the law and the prophets are nothing less, as the word, will and commandment of God, manifested from time to time unto mankind, and set down in writing by these good men, and for reason they were written, styled the writ. From these reasons I say that those people err greatly, who do not confess it <PB N="16" REF="045885_0016_10207ACF5B4ED070"/>to be the word of the Lord, but take it only for the holy writ, and your confessing, that men being mis∣led by it, you decline to call the written word, the word of God. Therefore I must put this question home to you, By what was Adam and Eve deceived, were they beguiled by the word of the Almighty fa∣ther or by the subtlety of the serpent? Dear friends, by what came Cain, to the atrocious crime of kill∣ing his brother Abel? has the everlasting word of God brought him to this act? I think not, but his own revengeful, wrathful, irreconcilable heart, which was not lighted by the word of God, but of hell; hear how the divine Majesty has warned and addressed him: <HI>Cain why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</HI> What was it, that has made the Antideluvians so wicked, was it the word of the Lord, which the most High said unto Noah, <HI>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he is also flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years,</HI> or his numerous admonitions or the ark be built. Have these divine manifestations of the everlasting word of God corrected these people, I think not, but the cursed disbelieve, (which is the source of all ungodliness) blended their hearts, that they could not believe the correcting word of God, but lived in their lusts and satanical desires, little minding the word of the Lord, nor his various ad∣monitions, in which he foretold them God's punish∣ment, nor the ark, which should be a sign to them of God's correcting hand. Is there any person that could shew, that the rebellious children of Israel, who <PB N="17" REF="045885_0017_10207B11064B7B10"/>fell a sacrifice in the wilderness, that they were de∣luded by the commandment and word of God. I think in my opinion, that whosoever will shun his conscience must confess, that they through their lusts of flesh and devilish desires, have always rebelled against the word of God. What made Ahab and Iezebel and all Israel, transgress the law and word of the Almighty? I should think the false prophets and priest of the high places, and not the word of the Lord. Ah! how well would it have been for Ahab, if he had taken to heart the word of God, which was told by the man of God Micah. Was Manasseh seduced by the law of the Lord, that he and all Israel lived af∣ter the abominations of the heathens and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them? Tell me dear friends, have they wrought wickedness by the word or commandment of God, in which the Lord in va∣rious places of the old testament, calls, admonishes and warns, that they should serve no other Gods but him? After my opinon dear friends, all them that have transgressed the law, word and commandment of God under the old testament, have not done it by the word of God, but by their own wickedness, lusts of flesh and bad desires, they fell from the law of God and did after the abominations of the heathens, and thereby provoked the Lord to anger. Tell me whose book of the law it was, that Hilkiah found in the house or temple of the Lord, which book Shaphan read before king Josiah; who hearing the words of the book, rent his clothes. Whose words were they, that the king grew terrified at? I think not at the word of Moses, but the word and commandment of the Almighty was transgressed by Manasseh, by Amon and all Israel, so that they by their wickedness have <PB N="18" REF="045885_0018_10207AD0E2F58620"/>provoked the anger of God. Read all the books of the prophets, wherein the will of God is manifested, there you will find by the grace of God, that the rebel∣lious children, were not seduced by the word of the Lord, but by instigation of Satan. It might be put the question, whether the children of men in our days, are made to sin by the word of God? I think not, but as the apostle Paul said, <HI>because they receiv∣ed not the love of the truth, that they might be saved: And for this cause, God shall send them strong delusi∣ons, that they believe a lie;</HI> and whereas our own flesh and blood is always rebellious and disobedient to the word of the Lord, and bent to do evil, seeks and desires nothing, but the things and pleasures of this world, and as long as we stop our ears before the menacing word of the Almighty, and not let us lead by the spirit of grace and the gospel which Jesus Christ brought from heaven; Ah! as long as we stop our ears before the menacing word, and not accept the gladful tidings of the gospel, ah! it is not the law nor the gospel that makes us sin; but it must be the Son of God himself that seduces poor mortals, since it was him that brought us his gospel, and has confirmed it with so many signs and wonders: so that we cannot see Jesus after the flesh, but after the spi∣rit, that is, if we let us led by the eternal spirit of God, he will lead us in all truth; God being the truth, and cannot tell a falshood after Paul, it must be his word without contradiction, and what he has spoken must be the truth, which all children of God have accepted as the same, not as a literal but as a spiritual word: And if we will look with spiri∣tual eyes into the written word of God, there we can∣not see Jesus after the flesh, but after the spirit, we <PB N="19" REF="045885_0019_10207B1555E1D650"/>can see his image, how he came into this world and how he has opened by his virtues, light, life and ex∣ample, the door to the kingdom of grace and to eternal life. Ah! who only believes, that his word is truth, he can see him, as they have seen him se∣venteen hundred and ninety years ago, with all his signs and wonders. But finding in various places of holy writ, especially in the prophets, how he was a stumbling block, whereon the two houses were of∣fended; I must ask each one of you, since men, when he was on earth, grew only worse, stumbled at him and fell, was the Son of the Almighty, the cause of it? who as St. John said, <HI>was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.</HI> Should any body dare to step forward, against the testimony of St, John and others, who witness of him, that he was the word, and say, that he was not the word of God, because men grew only worser by him? as old Simeon said of him, <HI>that he was set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</HI> Ah! dear friends whom or at what have the children of men spoken against or were offended at, at him or at his doctrine or word? I think not at his word, which he preached to men, but as they say themselves, <HI>that they do not stone him for his good works, but for his blasphemy, being a man and making himself a God;</HI> Here my dear friends here you may see, that they were not offended at his being a man, ah! they could have bore and tolerate him, if it had not been for his divine doctrine and word, which came from God, and was spoken by the eternal Son of God. See dear friends, at this very same word of God, which the Son of God has revealed, whereby he has manifested his divine image, <PB N="20" REF="045885_0020_10207AD3E01A98F0"/>light and brightness, the image of his godhead, his father's everlasting will and counsel, being with God from eternity; which gospel doctrine, has spread such divine light and brightness and has expressed the image of Jesus in such a perspicuous and perfect a man∣ner, that it shone into darkness, but darkness have not comprehended it, for their works were bad. But since the light of life, that is the word of God, has shone so clear, through Jesus Christ, that it not on∣ly reprimanded wicked sinners, but the thoughts of the heart also, <HI>why think you so evil in your hearts?</HI> Ah! they were not deluded by the meek gospel of Je∣sus Christ, but by their own flesh and blood and thro' deceit of Satan and by his hypocrisy, whereby he thinks to cloke his devilish doctrine under the figure of an angel, and pretending to be a teacher of the gos∣pel, he does as he did our first parents, and has done since and at all ages, when he pretended truth for his falshoods. Ah! therefore, dear friends, don't be deceived, as if men were made to sin by God's holy word; Ah! by no means friends, but we poor crea∣tures are deluded, by our own lusts and desires, which dwell in our flesh, and by subtlety of the Devil; this each sensible man will confess. For this reason I must ask you, perceiving from your writings, that you take the word of the Spirit, for the word of God, which I do likewise; whether the holy Ghost, who is the true teacher and expounder, of the many gifts of God, may reveal unto us another law, word, doc∣trine or gospel, than the Son of God or God himself has made manifest unto us? I think not! or the Son of God must have erred, when he said, <HI>he shall take it of mine, and shall shew it unto you,</HI> and again: <HI>But the comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the fa∣ther <PB N="21" REF="045885_0021_10207B18890795A0"/>will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance. whatsoever I have said unto you.</HI> St. Paul would have been mis∣taken also, when he said, <HI>if any man preach any other gospel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accursed, and the gospel which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je∣sus Christ; for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</HI> See also in St. John where he saith: <HI>if there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house.</HI> And St. Peter saith: <HI>we have also a more sure word of pro∣phecy; whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as un∣to a light that shineth in a dark place;</HI> and St. John again: <HI>whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God:</HI> and St. Paul, <HI>and if any man obey not my word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him.</HI> The written word being then so well attested, and its doctrine by a number of witnesses and of our Saviour himself, declared for his word, which he has confirmed by his precious blood, and of which St. Paul saith, <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation,</HI> which at the first began, to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him. I have told you in the foregoing my meaning and be∣lief of the written word of God, and have shewn you from the old and new testament, how all saints and children of God, have confessed it, to be the word of the Lord. And if the contrary can be proved to me, and the testimonies of all these witnesses I have quoted, annihilated; but not through philosophical subtlety, but by the immediate testimonies of holy <PB N="22" REF="045885_0022_10207ADB12D4A9D8"/>writ, that they have erred or wrote falsely; then I will confess and say, that I am mistaken, for taking the written word, for the word of God. But O my God! I trust in thee, that thou wilt not ashame us poor creatures, in this respect, with thy child Jesus and all holy prophets, apostles and so many thou∣sands of saints, who have all received it as thy word. Therefore I must beseech you, to take up this my epistle in love, and take it in consideration without partiality, and not to see on the simple style, but look to the ground. I shall quit here and refer the reader to the holy bible, there he will find more ground, if he searches with an upright heart. I re∣commend you to the word of grace, wishing that God will lead and enlighten me and you, with his everlast∣ing Spirit through Jesus Christ, Amen. His holy name be praised now and evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF THE CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>I CONFESS also dear friends! a christian Baptism of the faithful children of God, which is to be administered with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, which bap∣tism is a reception into the church and congregation of saints; which baptism ought to be administered un∣to all men, who stand in their first birth, and ought not to be called a christian baptism, if it is knowing∣ly administred unto unconverted, since the gospel doctrine of Jesus Christ, is not literal but spiritual, as he himself saith, <HI>the word which I have spoken is spi∣rit and is life.</HI> It being then spiritual, it requires al∣so spiritual and regenerated men, whose hearts were changed by the word of truth, and became new crea∣tures, that were brought from sin, to the virtue of Christ, from death to life and from darkness to the light of Jesus Christ, who strive to crucify their flesh and to mortify and to subdue their lusts. All such has St. John the baptist baptized and not wick∣ed sinners, but has told them <HI>to repent, that they might bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</HI> See! these has St. John baptized, and all such has Jesus Christ commanded to baptize, when he saith, <HI>All power is given unto me, in heaven and on earth. Go ye there∣fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have <PB N="24" REF="045885_0024_10207ADC9964A7F8"/>commanded you;</HI> and again: <HI>go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that be∣lieveth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.</HI> This injunction the disciples or apostles, received as the commandment of their Lord and master: But the Lord saying by Jeremiah, <HI>Behold the days come, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah. Not according to the covenant I made with their fathers; but this shall be the covenant, that I will make with the house of Israel; after those days,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his bro∣ther, saying, know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least of them, unto the greatest.</HI> The gospel word or new testament, which our Saviour has revealed, being spiritual, it is out of the power of the natural man to comprehend it, therefore the disciples of Christ were not able at first, to compre∣hend it perfectly, being yet earthly minded, therefore our Saviour told them, <HI>that they could not bear it now; But the holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things, to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</HI> Therefore the disciples of Christ were yet wholly unable to propagate the economy of the gos∣pel, the holy spirit not resting perfectly upon them; for this reason their Lord and master commanded them, <HI>not to depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father,</HI> to this commandment they were obedient, waiting in prayer day and night, till the day of Pentecost, when they were filled with the holy <PB N="25" REF="045885_0025_10207B1A10946A50"/>Ghost, so that their tongues, were like as of fire, and then they began after their Lord and master's com∣mandment to teach and to baptize, and in admini∣string of the same they have continued, not by the literal word of the law, but by the word of the Spi∣rit, of which the Spirit of God is the right teacher and interpreter, and in this order they have continu∣ed, as we can find in so many places, in the Acts of the apostles. Therefore the prophecies of the pro∣phets are accomplished, that they will teach no more one another, but they will all be teached of the Lord; the disciples having not teached, but the Spirit has spoken through them, and have established, the eco∣nomy of the gospel, as baptism and the Lord's sup∣per, and the washing of feet, likewise excommuni∣cation and forbearing. All these ordinances I con∣fess not to be derived from the Jewish law, but to be evangelical and christian ordinances of God. You dear friends! confessing in your writings, that bap∣tism, belongs not to the economy of the gospel, but being derived from the law. Therefore I must ask you dear friends, to prove to me by the law; where baptism has begun under the law, has it not taken its rise, with John the baptist? had John his baptism from the law? I think not, but by the divine com∣mandment, or this great prophet, has misinformed us, when he said, <HI>but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see, the Spirit descending and remaining on him.</HI> Our Saviour also questioned the Pharisees, <HI>whether the baptism of John was from heaven or of men?</HI> Why did not the scribes and Pharisees answer it was from the law, they had not need to be in fear of being sto∣ned by the people, but they could not, baptism not <PB N="26" REF="045885_0026_10207AE0C6570818"/>being founded in the law. John being a forerunner and preacher of repentance, he baptized with the baptism of repentance, which is the entrance into the new covenant; thus he had the commandment from God, and Jesus Christ being not come, to do his will, but the will of his Father, therefore he got him∣self baptized by John, in obedience to God, telling him, <HI>for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.</HI> Wherein consisteth the righteousness of Christ, that he got himself baptized by John, what use could he derive from water, being the Son of God, perfect, just and good? Tell me dear friends, wherein could the righteousness of Christ be, in the water or in the word of God, which commanded John to baptize? In my opinion in both, in the first place, the righte∣ousness of God pressing on the word, and being obe∣dient to his father, righteousness is fulfilled. And water was only a sign, proof, or outward ceremony or work, whereby the obedience of Christ, was con∣firmed and established. There you may see, where∣in the righteousness of Christ consisted, in his bap∣tism with water, or only in his obedience. Your teaching that Christ has not commanded the outward baptism with water, but only the baptism with the Spirit; has he not told them after his resurrection, <HI>to go teaching all nations, and to baptize them who be∣lieves?</HI> To this commandment the apostles were o∣bedient, as we find, when St. Peter on the day of Pentecost, preaching to them, that they were prick∣ed in their hearts, that they cried out, <HI>men and bre∣thren, what shall we do, to be saved?</HI> Then Peter said unto them, <HI>repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost.</HI> Dear <PB N="27" REF="045885_0027_10207B1D9451A130"/>friends, here you may see, how they have baptized them with water, and after baptism promised them the gift of the holy Ghost; we find that Philip has teached and baptized in Samaria, and that after bap∣tism, Peter and John prayed over them and laid their hands on them, that they might receive the holy Ghost. Philip has also baptized the eunuch, tell me what has he teached the Ethiopian, that he wanted to be baptized, when they came unto a certain water? Likewise St. Peter with Cornelius, when the holy Ghost fell on them, before they were baptized with water; why has Peter commandeth them, to be bap∣tized with water afterwards? Do you think that this dear instrument, who was full of the holy Ghost, was not sensible of the word of God? I think not, but being a clear commandment of the gospel. We can find also, how St. Paul was baptized by Ananias, likewise, how Paul has baptized the keeper of the prison with all his house, when he believed in God; also the seller of purple, and the disciples, unto which he said, <HI>have ye received the holy Ghost since ye be∣lieved? and they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy Ghost, and who were baptized with the baptism of John.</HI> The baptism of John, being the baptism of repentance, which refers man unto Christ, therefore has St. Paul baptized them on the name of Jesus Christ, then they receiv∣ed the holy Ghost and spoke with tongues. Many more testimonies could be produced, how they ad∣ministred the outward ceremony of the baptism with water unto them. It being dear friends! your in∣tention to break through the outward baptism with water, I must ask you, answer me from holy writ, where our Lord Jesus Christ, has given his disciples <PB N="28" REF="045885_0028_10207AE256702FB8"/>or apostles, the power, or commandeth them, to baptize men, with the holy Ghost? Does not our Lord himself exclaim, in many places by the pro∣phets, <HI>that in the last days, he would pour out, his Spirit upon all flesh;</HI> and John the baptist said, <HI>I in∣deed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me, he shall baptize you with the ho∣ly Ghost, and with fire.</HI> Take notice dear friends, what our Saviour himself said: <HI>it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will send him unto you; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin.</HI> Lo! dear friends from these quotati∣ons of the old and new testament, and you will find, that these baptism of the Spirit. was commandeth unto no man, or much less, that we poor mortals, could communicate one another the gift of the Spi∣rit, but it is a divine hidden wisdom of God, and power of the almighty Father, which spirit of grace, he gives to all his children, through Jesus Christ, so that he comes upon each of them, who is become a new creature and regenerated, humbling himself with a low and contrite heart, in obedience to Christ, that is, his word, which he has spoken and revealed, in all humility before the throne of grace, ardently pray∣ing day and night, for the spirit of grace, to be cloth∣ed with power, and to lighten the fire of his divine love in the heart. The baptism of the spirit is there∣fore a free gift and effusion of the Almighty, which we poor ereatures, can attain in no other way, than by a contrite heart and continual prayer. On this spirit of grace were the disciples of Christ waiting at Jerusalem, till they received the spirit of grace, and by their continual prayers they have obtained the <PB N="29" REF="045885_0029_10207B21C089D910"/>promise of the father, and thus the spirit of grace, is to be obtained in no other way, as I have shewn heretofore, I shall ask you, answer me, has St. Pe∣ter baptized the house of Cornelius, with the holy Ghost, or was it an heavenly divine secret baptism of the Spirit, unknowing to Peter? so that he was astonished, that the holy Ghost (mind) fell on the Gentiles. Tell me have St. Peter and John baptized the disciples of Samaria with the holy Ghost, or was it done by him, who John the baptist has shewn? I think it was done by him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Peter and John's ar∣dent prayer: hear, what Peter said, <HI>that by him which they had denied and killed, the Spirit had been poured out,</HI> and quotes from the prophet Joel, <HI>that this were the days, promised by God, in which he would pour out, his Spirit upon all flesh.</HI> Tell me has Ananias, baptized Paul with water or with the holy Ghost? I think with water, and Paul turning himself unto repentance and received the word and will of God, with an open heart, God has given him, his Spirit by his free grace. Tell me has Paul the apostle baptized the twelve, only with the holy Ghost, and not with water? Ah no! but with wa∣ter, and afterwards the holy Ghost fell on them, that they spoke with tongues. From this it is clear and evident, that Christ, has not commanded his disci∣ples, or given them power, to make use of the bap∣tism of the Spirit, but has told them to preach the gospel, and whosoever believes in the same, and re∣pents in humble obedience, him they should baptize; and who was baptized already, but believes not the gospel, shall be damned. Here dear friends! we may see, how it is not the baptism of the Spirit, which our Saviour commanded his disciples; for it <PB N="30" REF="045885_0030_10207AE3DC9830C0"/>may not be obtained by any men, except he is a true child of God. God knowing and searching the hearts of men, we cannot deceive him, with hypo∣crisy: but poor mortals as we are, we may be de∣ceived, as we may see, how Philip was deceived by Simon; when Peter and John came, laying their hands on the disciples and praying over them, they received the holy Ghost; there the heart of Simon revealed himself, when he offered them money, to give him power that on whomsoever he layed hands, he might receive the holy Ghost. But Peter said un∣to him, <HI>thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God, may be purchased with money; thou hast neither part nor lat, in this matter.</HI> Here we may see, that to be saved, consist not in baptism, but in the word, being commanded in it; as Abraham, when he received the command to sa∣crifice his son Isaac, he being obedient unto God, which was held him for his righteousness. The sa∣crificing of his son, being a testimony, proof or seal of his obedience, whereby his faith was confirmed. It is the same with the outward baptism with water, since it was expressly commandeth, therefore all faithful children of God, become new creatures, by obedience and the word of truth; our Saviour say∣ing, <HI>If a man love me, he will keep my words; if you love me, keep my commandments;</HI> for this reason they believing firmly, that whosoever transgresses, has no God. But since you say and will take it for a strong argument, when the apostle said, <HI>that there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</HI> from this you will infer, that there is only the baptism of the Spi∣rit, and you will of course deny any other baptism, though our Saviour himself saith: <HI>that he must be <PB N="31" REF="045885_0031_10207B2494EFECA0"/>baptized with a baptism,</HI> and again he said to his di∣sciples, <HI>are ye able to be baptized with the baptism, that I am baptized with? ye shall indeed be baptized, with the baptism that I am baptized with.</HI> Here we can see how Christ, speaks of another baptism, where∣with they must be baptized; all children of God hav∣ing participated in that baptism of sufferance. Here we may see, how Christ speaks not only of the bap∣tism of the spirit, but of three different baptisms, that is, of water, spirit and sufferance, and calls them all three baptisms. Therefore, if we look right∣ly into the doctrine and meaning of the apostle, it may be well, that there is only one Lord, one faith and one baptism, that is, he being the only Lord and Ruler of the universe, and has manifested his gospel word, and caused it to be revealed and preached by his disciples and apostles, how it is the perfect will and commandment of the Almighty Father, which Jesus Christ brought from heaven. See dear friends for this reason, he is called one Lord by Paul, when he said further, that there is one faith, so we cannot find more but one faith; this faith is not literal, as all men confess, when they say, that they believe in Jesus Christ, but deny his word, by their works and deeds. Ah dear friends! this is not the genuine quickening faith, but this faith has the quality, to make the heart good and upright before God, it is a gift and present of the Almighty, which we poor crea∣tures cannot communicate one another, but is to be derived from the word of God, if it is preached in right a manner, there it receives faith, which quick∣ening faith moves and presses sinners, so that they grow terrified, quit sin and live voluntarily in obe∣dience to the word. This faith being accompanied <PB N="32" REF="045885_0032_10207AEAB5CA66A8"/>with the love or spirit of God, and our Saviour says, <HI>that he leads into all truth,</HI> and love being from God, it leads also to the keeping of the commandment of God, as our Saviour says, <HI>if you love me you will keep my commandments,</HI> and John teaches: <HI>he that said, he loves God, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar.</HI> Since true quickening faith, bids so strict∣ly the keeping of the word, and the spirit leads unto truth, and love to obedience and keeping of the com∣mandments of God. And whereas the apostles were clothed with the same spirit, faith and love, so this spirit, faith and love have driven, moved and made their tongues fiery, that they in the first place, after the commandment of their Lord and master, begun to teach, and then to baptize with water, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the holy Ghost, as they received the commandment from Je∣sus. See here, in what light, Paul called Jesus one Lord, he having given unto men, his commandments and interdictions, and there being only one faith who accompanied with spirit and love, brings to obe∣dience, therefore it is spiritual, through the word of God, spirit, faith and love; I say once more spi∣ritual, since every thing was teached and performed by the spirit of God, according to what the apostle said, <HI>that we were all baptized through one Spirit to one body,</HI> and as he calls it in another place, <HI>the wash∣ing of regeneration.</HI> But it is not to be understood, that baptism, is the regeneration, but I would only prove, how baptism is necessary unto regenerated, as a proof and seal, that they were regenerated, or else circumcision must have been the covenant him∣self; but circumcision was only an addition to the <PB N="33" REF="045885_0033_10207B261BB1CC48"/>covenant, as a proof of obedience: So it is with bap∣tism, for St. Paul said, <HI>that they were cleansed with the washing of water by the word;</HI> Ah! dear friends it is not to be understood, that they were cleansed by the washing of water, but by the word, being obedient unto God; as our Saviour saith, <HI>ye are clean, by the word, that I have spoken unto you.</HI> We can read likewise how St. Peter represents baptism after Noah, when the ark was a preparing, wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water. The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.) To understand this right we must take Noah as a figure on Christ and the ark as his word, and the entrance of Noah the congregation of God; therefore was No∣ah called a preacher of righteousness, and thus he has prepared the ark by the commandment of God, for himself and his house, therefore the ark was prepared by the word of the Lord and at the same time repent∣ance preached. Thus Christ as the true preacher of righteousness, came into this world, and prepared the ark of the new covenant by the command of his heavenly father, for his children and people and has preached repentance. It was also with Noah, when he received the divine command, to enter into the ark he and his house, he paid obedience unto it, Thus Christ when the ark of the new testament was prepa∣red, entered into it, and has confirmed and sealed the new covenant by his precious and innocent blood, in obedience to the will of his father. So as the fa∣mily of Noah entered it after him obediently, also the oeconomy of Christ enters, through obedience and repentance into the ark of the new covenant, and <PB N="34" REF="045885_0034_10207AEC420C23B0"/>as the waters of the flood rose and all flesh perished, but the water bearing the ark, that Noah and his fa∣mily were saved by the water. But it is not quite to be understood, that they were saved by the water only, Peter calling it a type on baptism. There∣fore the preservation of Noah and his family, con∣sisted not in the water, but especially in obedience, he believing God and preparing the ark by faith; So it is with the baptism of water, it being commanded in the unalterable will of God, therefore all faithful, will not reject it, but pay obedience, with living faith, unto the word of God, accepting the baptism with water, so as time and occasion occurs, for St. Peter said, <HI>that even baptism, doth also now save us,</HI> (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.) Here we may see how explicitly Peter speaks of baptism, for the sake of our salvation, how necessary it is to be saved, our salvation consisting altogether in Christ and in keeping of his commandments; faith without works being dead, and it being told in the gospel∣word, to make use of this baptism with water, and whosoever is become a new creature and regenerated, keeping all and every thing prescribed in the gospel, and would refuse the baptism with water, if he could have it in a christian manner, but would reject it, from spiritual pride or negligence or self-conceited righteousness, the same shall know, that he slights the will of God, for our Saviour says, <HI>that whoso∣ever transgresses one, is guilty of the whole.</HI> We find also, that the selfthoughts of men are of no avail; for Saul erred greatly in transgressing the word of the Lord, and acting after his own thoughts; what avail had the man of God, in going to Bethel, to <PB N="35" REF="045885_0035_10205705F56F7568"/>prophesy, when he transgresseth the word of the Lord, that the lion devoureth him? Therefore St. Peter calls baptism a saving, faith and obedience be∣ing made perfect thereby; he says also, "that it does not put away the filth of the flesh, but the an∣swer of a good conscience towards God; Water is also not able to cleanse us, but our hearts must be cleansed by the word and blood of Christ, if we pro∣strate ourselves in humility and true repentance before him, crying for mercy, he then forgives us our sins, out of his free grace, when faith, spirit and love are united together. In this obedience, all true chil∣dren of God went and got themselves baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, yielding themselves into the communion of saints, renouncing the Devil, deny∣ing their own flesh and blood, giving over their own will and devoting themselves wholly, to their hus∣band and bridegroom Jesus Christ. And this is the covenant, which all children of God must enter into with their God and bridegroom. Water therefore is not the covenant, but a testimony of the covenant and of the true obedience; we find also, that the apostles have kept this rule, for St. Paul repeats it, to the Romans that if they should have been loath, and exhorts them, that they should know, that so many of them as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death, and tells them, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the father, even so they also should walk in newness of life: And he admonishes the Galatians, they hav∣ing left the faith and depended upon the law, he shews them again to the new covenant, which they had accepted, when he said, <HI>whether they did not know, that as many of them as have been baptized in∣to <PB N="36" REF="045885_0036_10207AEF4CEFA540"/>Christ, have put on Christ,</HI> he says, <HI>There is nei∣ther Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</HI> But it is not to be understood, that they be∣came one by the water, but by the quickening faith, spirit and the love of God, who wroughts always their fruit and brings unto obedience, and the water being only the fruit and proof of obedience, where∣by faith is confirmed. We find also how the apo∣stle exhorts the Hebrews, <HI>for when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</HI> Therefore he says, <HI>leaving the princi∣ples of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfec∣tion, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of saith towards God, of the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</HI> See here how the apostle exhorteth the faithful, how they have need, that one teach them again, but to continue in the doctrine, he will leave it, and go on unto perfection; so that we can see, that all epistles, which the apostles have wrote, were directed to con∣gregations, which they had edified before by the gos∣pel, exhorting them always, to be stedfast, in what they had accepted. St. Luke has related us the whole oeconomy of the gospel, that we may see, how the apostles have established it, by the spirit and word of God. Therefore I acknowledge all institutions of God, which are outwardly performed in the con∣gregation of saints, that they are right and unexcep∣tionable, as also the breaking of the bread, and I acknowledge likewise, that they are not derived from <PB N="37" REF="045885_0037_10207B2E71D9BBE8"/>the Jews, but appertain unto the oeconomy of Christ, since he has instituted them himself, and has com∣manded that they should be exercised. But your doctrine saying, that all these institutions were brought to their end under the new covenant, and that the apostles found it expedient to continue them any farther, being derived from the law of Moses, I must ask you, what shall be the reason, when St. Paul writes to the Hebrews, that he will leave the the principles of the doctrine of Christ. Was Paul's intention to leave all, the doctrine, and all what he has mentioned there? I think not, or else he would have continued in instructing them. But hear! he will leave the principles of the doctrine of Christ on∣ly with them, who were instructed many times there∣in, and received the baptism already, with them it would have been unnecessary, he having found them remiss therein. Or it is because St. Paul had said <HI>that he had not been sent to baptize, but to preach the gospel;</HI> if he was not sent to baptize, why did he baptize nevertheless? for he says that he baptized some amongst them. But this is no proof, that he thought baptism to be unnecessary, for he tells them moreover, <HI>that he hath planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase,</HI> he said this, about their distensions and divisions amongst them, he appre∣hending, that they might say, <HI>he having baptized in his name.</HI> I shall leave it here and refer the cordial reader to the holy Bible, and if it can be proved other∣wise to me from the same, I am ready to take advice, and if I should be called up, to give more ground, I am willing in my simpleness, to give it after the admonition of St. Peter. But if you acknowledge it to be right, then give the honour unto God, and <PB N="38" REF="045885_0038_10207AF22AE80628"/>not unto men. I recommend you my dear friends, with me, to the powerful word of his Grace, that he may comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work, and lead us and every one to the pasture of his word, and to the right understand∣ing of God, this I wish you and me, and unto all men, through Jesus Christ Amen.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the peaceable Kingdom of</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>I MUST add one short question or admonition to you my dear friends! Perceiving in the gospel word and the books of the Prophets, that our Savi∣our Jesus Christ, is a peaceable King, and reigns a peaceable kingdom, as the prophet saith: <HI>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the go∣vernment shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shalt be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</HI> He says moreover, <HI>that they will turn their swords into plough∣shears and their spears into pruning-hooks, and they shall know of no wars; the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion, and the fatling toge∣ther, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cocka∣trice's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my ho∣ly mountain.</HI> Many more passages could be quoted from the books of the Prophets of this peaceable king Jesus Christ, and of his peaceable kingdom and church, how he will establish right on earth and the isles shall wait for his law. This king of kings in com∣ing into this world, was not born in a royal palace, but a stable must be his inn, he was also always persecut∣ed, banished, hated and mocked at from his youth, and came at last to the ignominious death on the cross as a curse and expiatory sacrifice for all the world. But <PB N="40" REF="045885_0040_10207AF3B25256E8"/>since we can find in no place, that he even sought revenge, or revenged himself, but he teaches us, that it was said by them in old times, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour, and hate thine enemy;" the Son of the Al∣mighty tells us the contrary, saying, <HI>but I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also, and love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which dispite∣fully use you, and persecute you; and if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</HI> Jesus Christ having gone before us, in this doctrine, life and example, and has com∣manded us, to follow his said example and has deni∣ed all revenge and resistance, which he has shewn and manifested in his gospel doctrine and kingdom of grace, and has told us to bear all afflictions where∣with he visits us, and not to revenge ourselves, but leave vengeance unto him. You saying in your pub∣lications, that all revenge was forbidden under the new covenant, which I confess also: I must put this question to you, where war, is more and earnestly forbidden as going to law, resist force by force and to be elected into offices; and if we for the gospel and Christ's sake, cannot hold any office, how should we be capable, to elect others into offices, does not Jesus say, "that his kingdom was not from this world, and that he would appoint unto us a king∣dom, as his father hath appointed unto him." You denying totally all warfare, but make use of going to law, by resisting force by force, almost as much and more as people of other denominations. I must ask you once more, where the one is more forbid∣den <PB N="41" REF="045885_0041_10207B3185240658"/>than the other. I confess also that there are two kingdoms, Christ saying, that his kingdom was not from this world. There we find, that the kingdom of Christ is different from the kingdoms of this world, as he saith to his disciples, "the kings of the Gen∣tiles exercise lordship over them; and they that ex∣ercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief as he that doth serve." And again when the revenge of the law took place with his discipies, that they said unto him, <HI>wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</HI> Our Saviour rebuked them and said, <HI>ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</HI> There we can see how Christ has commanded his disciples, to keep peace: when he said, <HI>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, I give unto you. By this shall all men know, that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Great∣er love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his brethren.</HI> Since it is clear and mani∣fest, that the kingdom of Christ is a peaceable king∣dom, but men being bad from nature, withstanding the peace of the Almighty and will not submit them∣selves under the scepter of his word. Therefore all men who will not submit under the scepter of the Almighty, they must submit themselves under the scepter of the kings and princes of this world, which were ordained of God the king of kings and lord of lords, to reign the kingdom of this world. There∣fore all and every one stands under the obligation to pay allegiance and obedience unto them, and to a∣void, all rebellion or conspiracy, that might be plot∣ed <PB N="42" REF="045885_0042_10207AF7ED5116E8"/>against them; but not for the sake of kings or princes, but for God's sake, they being ordained of God to their administrations; children of God and regenerated, and who have followed the spirit of God and have voluntarily submitted themselves un∣der the scepter of his word, have no further obliga∣tion to be obedient unto them as in so far, as their law are not contrary to the word of God, for it is just and right to obey God more, then unto men. This peace being offered unto all men, and unto all without exception, repentance was preached through Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the gospel word, therefore no man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, be he Jew, Gentile or Turk, or of what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, nation or denomination he may be, be they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or of a mean descent, rich or poor, king or prince, they were all called unto repentance, for God is no respecter of persons: Unto all was al∣so given, one and the same law and word, for he does not care the power of the mighty, nor is he ashamed, of the lowness of the poor; Therefore whosoever repents, prostrating himself with a con∣trite heart, before the majesty of the Almighty in humility and submitting himself, in true regenerati∣on, quits sin, and goes out of every thing, that is against God and his word, he may be who he will, the same will obtain this free grace. <HI>Whosoever comes unto me, I will in no wise reject him, and come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,</HI> for the foundation of God stand∣eth sure, having this seal, "The Lord knoweth them, that are his. And let every one, that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity." As to your addresses, which you send to kings and princes, I can at this time see no other motive in it, as that <PB N="43" REF="045885_0043_10207B338C3C56E8"/>they are meant to flatter with, and to obtain applause and honour before the world. I bid you farewell dear friends, and the God of peace will bless our hearts. To him be praise, honour and power, now and evermore, through Jesus Christ, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
