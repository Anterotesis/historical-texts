<P>A LETTER; IN WHICH TWO OF THE <HI>Rev. Mr. FLETCHER's PRINCIPLES</HI> ARE COMPARED, AND PROVED TO BE INCON∣SISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. AND IN WHICH IS ALSO, AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW WHAT IS THE TRUTH, BY DENYING WHICH THIS AUTHOR CONTRA∣DICTED HIMSELF.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following letter, has been desired, by some of the followers of Mr. Fletcher, to state in writing his objections to that author's works. But to point out all the absur∣dities attending such a mixture of truth and false∣hood, would require much time and pains. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the letter therefore has, as yet, at∣tempted to expose but one contradiction attending that author's principles. But this, if it be a real contradiction, is sufficient, 'tis presumed, to con∣vince persons of sense and candor, that Mr. F—r's writings contain no consistent scheme of christian doctrines.</P>
<P>This letter when first written was by no means designed for the press; but only as a letter to a private friend at his own request. But as some to whom it was first read, expressed a desire to have it printed; and as it will in this way, be, not only better understood, but more extensive∣ly read; and as Mr. F—r's works are rapidly spreading among us, and many are hastily em∣bracing his doctrines, the letter is submitted to public perusal and examination.</P>
<P>Our ablest divines view Mr. F—r's works as beneath their notice. And tis true, that he is a very absurd and inconsistent writer. But it is equally true that his writings, being very agree∣able to corrupt human nature, are doing much mischief in some parts of Long-Island. It is highly necessary therefore, that some body take a
<PB N="iv" REF="026710_0003_0FD16315CD260720"/>
little pains to expose some of his absurdities and inconsistences.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will object that the author of the letter is a young writer, ambitious to excel, and has therefore published this, with a view merely to display his abilities. That this is not the case, he will not undertake to prove with his pen. He means to judge others by their fruits in general; and exctpes thus to be judged himself.</P>
<P>But suppose he has published this with no o∣ther view than merely to display his abilities; what then? Will it certainly follow that Mr. F—r has not contradicted himself? Or will it certainly follow that the contradiction is too trifling to be worthy of notice?</P>
<P>In answer to the first part of the objection, that the author of the letter is a young writer it may be observed, that perhaps he will be found old enough to point out at least one grand contra∣diction attending Mr. F—r's principles: And perhaps more if the cause of religion should re∣quire it. Besides, if from the following letter, it shall appear that a young writer can point out such a contradiction of principles in that author's works, what may we not suppose an old writer could do?</P>
<P>It will be further objected, perhaps, that this letter will offend the followers of Mr. F—r? If it should offend any of them, let the impartial judge whether such will not be offended princi∣pally because one of their errors of sentiment is
<PB N="v" REF="026710_0004_0FD16317AB742D10"/>
made manifest to themselves and others? And if this should be the case, will they not have reason to doubt their own pious sincerity, in proportion as they may be offended? Let such read, John iii. 20 and 21. This letter will offend none, tis pre∣sumed, but such as are much under the influence of prejudice. And if we must not point out and expose errors for fear of offending such, all wri∣ting and preaching to defend the truth, must be laid aside.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU doubtless recollect that you lately desir∣ed me to state to you in writing my objec∣tions to Mr. Fletcher's scheme. I beg then you would do me, and yourself the kindness to read with impartiality, condor, care and attention the following pages:</P>
<P>You may observe that this author is bitterly opposed to all necessity in moral matters. One important and essential principle in his scheme is this, That all absolute necessity either of our do∣ing moral evil, or of our being the subjects of moral evil, is absolutely inconsistent with our be∣ing either blamable or punishable for such moral evil: Or in other words; That God cannot, consistently with his perfections, blame or punish s for doing or being what we cannot avoid. I will cite some of his own assertions to this effect.</P>
<P><Q>And that the absolute necessity of all human actions is incompatible with a moral law and a day of judgement, is (says he) an axiom in every prejudiced mind.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 201.
<Q>And conscience declares, that it is unjust and
<PB N="8" REF="026710_0006_0FD1631A6E6643F0"/>
cruel to inflict fearful, eternal punishments upon beings that have only moved and acted by ab∣solute necessity.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<Q>Abso∣lute necessity and a righteous judgement are absolutely incompatible.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<Q>If through the saving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu∣ed with an awful power to chuse life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to punish or recompence mankind, as to whip a dead horse for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its flui∣dity.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 91.
<Q>And when you insinuate, that the lawgiver of the universe will send all workers of iniquity to hell, for not doing what is lawful and right to save their souls alive, or for not avoiding sin, when he never gave them the least power personally so to do, you pour almost as much contempt upon his perfections, as if you said that he will one day raise all creeping insects to judge them ac∣cording to their steps, and to cast into a place of torment as many as did not move as swift as a race horse.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 92.
<Q>But the scheme which I oppose, instead of leaving men without excuse, opens their mouths and fills them with the best apology in the world. Ab∣solute necessity and complete impossibility, caused by another before we were born. An apology this which no candid person can ever object to.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 172.</P>
<P>Such you know, Sir, is his language through∣out a considerable part of the third and fourth volumes. And the principle he advances in the places, I have here cited, is a principle upon
<PB N="9" REF="026710_0007_0FD1631BD04A1AE0"/>
which he lays great stress, as every one must be sensible who has ever perused this author. In∣deed, almost or quite all his reasoning against the absolute decrees of God, the sovereignty of grace and the like, is found upon this principle.</P>
<P>You see then that one important and essential principle in his scheme is, That all absolute neces∣sity either of our doing moral evil, or of our be∣ing the subjects of moral evil, is absolutely in∣consistent with our being either blamable or pu∣nishable for such moral evil: Or, That God cannot, consistently with his perfections, blame or pu∣nish us for doing or being what we cannot avoid.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I will endeavour to show, from this author's own words, that another important and essential part of his scheme is founded upon a principle which is absolutely inconsistent with the above mentioned principle; and directly contra∣dictory to it. The principle upon which this part of his scheme is founded is the following one: That absolute necessity of our doing moral evil, or of our being the subjects of moral evil, is perfectly <HI>consistent</HI> with our being both blamable and punishable for such moral evil: Or in other words; That God <HI>could,</HI> consistently with his perfections blame and punish us for doing such moral evil as we could not avoid. And if I fully and clearly show that one part of Mr F—r's scheme is founded upon this last mentioned prin∣ciple, I hope you will have candor enough to ac∣knowledge that he has absolutely contradicted himself, and that one part of his scheme is abso∣lutely inconsistent with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026710_0008_0FD1631D8818B160"/>In the first place then, he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a state, in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil. They must necessarily have gone on in nothing but sin and wickedness. For he undertakes to vindicate what Mr. Wesley as∣serted (viz.) The total fall of man, and that by nature man's will is only free to evil. See vol. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 16 and 21. And Mr F—r expressly says, that he agrees with Mr. Hill in this;
<Q>That the will of man, considered as fallen in Adam, and unassisted by the grace of God, is <HI>only free to evil</HI>—free to live in the element of sin, as a sea fish is only free to live in salt water.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 210. And in another place.
<Q>without him (that is Christ) we have (says he) no∣thing but helplessness; we can do nothing but sin.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 200. Again.
<Q>The lan∣guage of a penitent sinner, is (says he) Lord, I pray and hear, I fast and receive, I give alms, and keep the Sabbath, but after all I am an umprofitable servant. I must work out my own salvation with fear and trembling, and yet without thee I can do nothing. I cannot change my heart. I cannot root up from my breast the desire of praise, the thirst of plea∣sure, and the hankering after gold, vanity, beauty, or sensual gratifications which I conti∣nually feel. Without thee I cannot force my stubborn heart to repent, believe and love; to be meek and lowly, calm and devout. Lord deliver me from this body of death; Lord save or I perish.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 52. And in another place the author has these words.
<Q>I protes in opposition to Pharisaic pride, that we have
<PB N="11" REF="026710_0009_0FD1631ECC9C2640"/>
no power to do good works pleasant and ac∣ceptable to God, without the grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</Q>
Vol. iv. page 135. Once more.
<Q>From what has been observed it follows (says he) that before any one can believe in the gospel sense of the word, he must be convinced of sin by the spirit of God He must feel himself a <HI>guil∣ty, lost,</HI> and <HI>helpless</HI> sinner, unable to recover the favour and image of God by his own strength and righteousness.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 44.</P>
<P>Many more passages of the same import I could easily cite from this author: But these I trust are sufficient to show he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a state in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil: That they must necessarily and unavoidably have gone on in sin and wickedness.</P>
<P>In the second place, this author holds that mankind would have been blamable and punisha∣ble for their necessary and unavoidable sin and wickedness, had a Saviour never been provided, this appears from his expressions which I have al∣ready cited: Such as these;
<Q>The will of man considerered as fallen in Adam, and unassisted by the grace of God, is only free to evil—free to live in the element of sin, as a sea-fish is only free to live in salt water.</Q>
<Q>Without him (that is Christ) we have nothing but helpless∣ness; we have nothing but sin,</Q>
&amp;c. By <HI>evil,</HI> and by <HI>sin</HI> and the like here, we are undoubtedly to understand that for which mankind are blama∣ble and punishable; otherwise it cannot be <HI>moral evil</HI>: It cannot be <HI>sin.</HI> If then without Christ
<PB N="12" REF="026710_0010_0FD163204DC94FE8"/>
mankind have nothing but <HI>helplessness</HI>; nothing but <HI>sin,</HI> and their wills be free only to evil and the like, it follows that without a Saviour mankind would <HI>necessarily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> have been both blamable and punishable. They would have been, according to what Mr. F—r holds, under an <HI>absolute necessity</HI> of going on in sin, so as to have been guilty, blamable, and punishable. And he evidently grants all this in saying that a person before he believes in the gospel,
<Q>Must feel himself a <HI>guilty, lost,</HI> and <HI>helpless</HI> sinner,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>But we need not rest the matter here: For in other places he is very full and express to the purpose. He holds that all mankind are, by na∣ture and without Christ, under the first covenant made with Adam. And he holds that it is impos∣sible for any mere man since the fall to keep this covenant. At the same time he holds that all mankind, without Christ; are under the curse, children of wrath, and condemned for not keep∣ing it.
<Q>This first covenant (says he) we have all broken in our first parents; for in Adam all died—By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.; Rom. v. 12. We are then all born or conceived in sin; Ps. li. 5. And consequently we are by nature chil∣dren of wrath; Eph. ii. 3. But this is not all: This root of original sin produces in every man many actual iniquities; whereby we imitate Adams rebellion, so we make the guilt of it our own, and fasten the <HI>curs<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tending that guilt, <HI>upon our own souls.</HI> Rom. vii. 25. There∣fore, while we remain in our natural state, or to speak more intelligibly, while we continue
<PB N="13" REF="026710_0011_0FD16321F5C52AD0"/>
in sin, guilt, and total impenitency, we not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trample the covenant of grace under foot, but we <HI>stand upon the covenant of works</HI>; and consequently lie under the dreadful curse, which is already denounced against every transgressor of the law</Q>
Gal. iii 10. Vol. iii. page 40.</P>
<P>Is this then the case? Have we all broken the first covenant in our first parents! Have we all sinned in this way? And are we by nature chil∣dren of wrath? And does this root of original sin produce in every man many actual iniquities, so that we fasten the <HI>curse upon our own souls?</HI> And he under the dreadful curse which is already denounced against every transgressor of the law? Have we all then broken the first covenant, and for breaking it are we thus, children of wrath and under the dreadful curse and the like? Would not all the posterity of Adam then, have been blamable and punishable for their <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> sin and wickedness, had a Saviour never been provided? If Mr. F—r was now here, how would he avoid this consequence? Does it not inevitably follow from his own premises? Surely he would not pretend that <HI>Christ has,</HI> by his coming, brought us under the first covenant, and made us thus guilty, blamable and punishable for breaking it? If he should pretend this, he would contradict himself in another particular: For he holds that Christ came to free us from the first covenant, and from the guilt, blame, and con∣demnation which we have incurred by breaking it. See vol. iv. page 162. If then Christ had never come, all the posterity of Adam would have been under an <HI>absolute necessity</HI> of being <HI>sin∣ful
<PB N="14" REF="026710_0012_0FD16323D0B11A10"/>
guilty, blamable, punishable</HI>; and of being <HI>condemned</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>Equally full and express to the purpose he is in another place.
<Q>Under the first covenant, ab∣solute, unsinning, universal obedience in our own persons is (says he) required; and such obedience we, in our fallen state, <HI>can never perform.</HI></Q>
Vol. iii. page 43. But surely God does not require more of us than he can justly blame and punish us for not doing. It would be blasphemy to suppose that he does: For it would be nothing less than supposing him to require more than he ought to require or could justly require. It follows then, that had a Saviour never been provided, God could justly, and in fact would have blamed and punished mankind for their <HI>ne∣cessary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> guilt, and wickedness.</P>
<P>Once more,
<Q>The second covenant or the gospel is (he tells in another place) a dis∣pensation of free grace and mercy to <HI>poor, lost, helpless sinners,</HI> who seeing and feeling them∣selves <HI>condemned</HI> by the law of innocence; and <HI>utterly unable</HI> to <HI>obtain justification</HI> upon the terms of the <HI>first covenant,</HI> come to Jesus Christ,</Q>
&amp;c. Vol. iii. page 42. Here then I ask what would these have done if no Saviour had been pro∣vided? Must they not <HI>necessarily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> have been condemned by the law of innocence? And must not this condemnation have <HI>necessarily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> come upon all the fallen race of Adam?</P>
<P>Again:
<Q>Total death, or a full departure of the Holy Spirit. This (says Mr. F—r) passed upon Adam <HI>and all mankind in him,</HI> when he lost God's moral image; fell into selfish na∣ture,
<PB N="15" REF="026710_0013_0FD16324CD3C61C8"/>
and was buried in sin, guilt, shame and horror.</Q>
Vol. i. page 259. According to this author, therefore, spiritual death passed upon all mankind in Adam when he lost God's moral im∣age. And thus judgement came upon all men to condemnation; so that even infants must be justi∣fied by Christ or be damned. We therefore find him speaking of the justification which passes up∣on infants, thus;
<Q>That which passes upon all infants universally, and is thus described by St. Paul; as by the offence of one judgement came upon <HI>all</HI> men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto justification from original sin.</Q>
&amp;c. Vol. i. page 263. And in another place, speaking respecting the four degrees of justifica∣tion, he has these words respecting that which passes upon us in our infancy.
<Q>All these de∣grees of justification are equally merited by Christ. We do nothing in order to the first, because it finds us in a state of total death.</Q>
Vol. i. page 264.</P>
<P>But infants could not stand in need of this jus∣tifitation by Christ if they were not <HI>guilty, bla∣mable</HI> and <HI>punishable.</HI> It follows then that if Christ had never come and merited these degrees of jus∣tification, the very infants must have been blama∣ble, punishable and condemned. But could in∣fants have prevented the offence of their first pa∣rent Adam? It will not be pretended It fol∣lows then that, if a Saviour had never been pro∣vided, all the posterity of Adam, who might have died in their very <HI>infancy</HI> would have been under an <HI>absolute necessity</HI> of being, <HI>guilty, bla∣mable</HI> and <HI>punishable.</HI> Nay, all such must accord∣ing
<PB N="16" REF="026710_0014_0FD163264D03A658"/>
to Mr. F—r, have necessarily been con∣demned forever. This is going a great stretch indeed. This author ought to blush at mention∣tioning even the name of "Rigid calvinists." For I trust there are few who will equal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in ri∣gidness with regard to this matter.</P>
<P>Does it not appear then that all the posterity of Adam would, according to Mr. F—r, have been <HI>blamable</HI> and <HI>punishable</HI> for their <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> guilt, and wickedness? I could easily produce many more of his assertions of the same import. But these I trust are amply suffici∣ent to show that, according to this author, God could justly have blamed and punished mankind for such sin, guilt and wickedness as they could not possibly have avoided, in case a Saviour had never been provided. All the posterity of Adam would have been under an absolute necessity of be∣ing guilty, and consequently of being condemned.</P>
<P>But how does all this agree with the first men∣tioned principle of his (viz.) that
<Q>Absolute ne∣cessity and a righteous judgement are absolute, incompatible,</Q>
and the like: Or which I take to be the same thing, that absolute necessity either of our doing moral evil, or being the subjects of moral evil, is absolutely inconsistent with our being either blamable or punishable for such moral evil. If I can understand language here is an express and manifest contradiction in these two principles belonging to Mr. F—r's scheme. And, Sir, how does he help himself out of this dilemma? How does he free his scheme from this entanglement? Will you say he holds that God has provided a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and by him freed all the pos∣terity of Adam from this absolute necessity of sin∣ning,
<PB N="17" REF="026710_0015_0FD163282AC80AA8"/>
of being guilty, blamable and punishable, and of being condemned? I grant it. He does hold to this. We therefore find him expressing himself in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Every anti Calvinist may, and I for one do believe, that in every man born into the world, and considered according to the first covenant, <HI>original</HI> corruption, (nor Adam's transgression) <HI>deserves God's wrath and damnation</HI> at the hands of an holy and righteous God, without dreaming that any man shall ever be damned for it: See∣ing that according to God's mercy and good∣ness displayed in the second covenant. Christ the second Adam, is come to taste death for every man and to be a Saviour of all men; so that for his sake the free gift is come upon all men unto justification of life.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 245.</P>
<P>It seems then that <HI>original corruption</HI> in every man born into the world, and considered accord∣ing to the first covenant, <HI>deserves,</HI> (according to this author's own words) God's wrath and dam∣nation at the hands of an holy and righteous God. But is it possible for Adam's posterity to <HI>avoid o∣riginal corruption?</HI> He does not pretend it. Why then may not the posterity of Adam be, not only blamable and punishable, but damned for what they could not possibly, avoid? Because,
<Q>Christ the second Adam (says Mr. F—r) is come to taste death for every man, and to be a Saviour of all men; so that for his sake the free gift is come upon all men unto justification of life</Q>
This is his solution of the difficulty. Let us then pay particular attention to it. Let us carefully
<PB N="18" REF="026710_0016_0FD163294D93BD10"/>
examine this answer and see whether it is really helping the matter.</P>
<P>Here then let it be observed, that Mr. F—r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <HI>free gift</HI> as in the words just cited from him. And you, Sir, know very well I trust, that he holds to the same throughout his writings. He holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <HI>free gift</HI> and <HI>wholly of free grace.</HI> He holds that the capacity which Christ has given all mankind to repent and chuse life, and that the power which Christ has given all mankind to believe and repent; and that the day of salvation, with a talent of living light, and rectified free agency and the like, are all of <HI>free grace.</HI> I could produce a great variety of his own assertions to prove what I here assert. But it is needless for no one, who has ever perused this author, will, I presume, pretend to deny that he holds all mankind have these favours of <HI>free grace.</HI></P>
<P>If then the gift of a Saviour be a <HI>free gift</HI> and <HI>wholly of free grace,</HI> it follows that God was un∣der no <HI>obligations</HI> to give us Christ; nor any of the blessings which flow to us through him. Con∣sequently he might justly have with-held the gift of a Saviour, and all these blessings from mankind, and left them in their fallen condition. And then what would have been the condition of mankind? All the posterity of Adam would have been un∣der <HI>an absolute necessity</HI> of being totally corrupt, and of going on in sin and wickedness. And they would, according to what Mr. F—r tells us, have deserved God's wrath and damnation even for their <HI>original corruption.</HI> And surely they
<PB N="19" REF="026710_0017_0FD1632ACD8DBA00"/>
would have deserved as much as this for their ac∣tual transgressions of the law of innocence.</P>
<P>Does this author then help the matter in this way? No person of sense and candor will suppose it: For according to his own principles, God might justly have <HI>with-held</HI> the gift of a Saviour and all free grace. And if so, it follows that every man born into the <HI>world</HI> would have de∣served God's wrath and damnation even for that <HI>original corruption</HI> which they <HI>could not possibly have avoided; but must necessarily</HI> have had. And besides their original corruption they would have had many actual iniquities. And most certainly these would have deserved as much as their ori∣ginal corruption.</P>
<P>But how does these things harmonize with this author's favorite principle, that,
<Q>Absolute necessity and a righteous judgment are absolute∣ly incompatible?</Q>
And how do they harmo∣nize with the following assertion of his:
<Q>If, through the saving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu∣ed with an awful power to chuse life, and to be faithful, it would be as insidious to punish or recompense mankind, as to whip a dead horse for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</Q>
Let candor and common sense judge whether here be not a most awful jaring of principles. Does not Mr. F—r hold to two principles which must be at eternal war with each other?</P>
<P><Q>We oppose (says he) the doctrine of abso∣lute necessity, or the Calvinian must as being inseparable from Manicheism; and we assert that there is no <HI>needs must</HI> in the eternal
<PB N="20" REF="026710_0018_0FD1632C4CEF2070"/>
death of any man; because Christ im∣parts a degree of temporary salvation to all, with power to obey, and a promise to bestow eternal salvation upon all that will obey.</Q>
Vol. iv. page 88.</P>
<P>From what this author here says it seems that the <HI>reason</HI> why there is no
<Q><HI>Needs must</HI> in the eternal death of any man,</Q>
is the <HI>coming of Christ</HI> and imparting a degree of temporary sal∣vation to all with power to obey and a promise to bestow eternal salvation upon all that will obey. This, as well as what he says otherwhere, implies that if Christ had never come, there <HI>would</HI> have been a "<HI>Needs must</HI>" in the eternal death of some. It implies that there <HI>would</HI> have been a "<HI>Needs must</HI>" in the eternal death of all Adam's posterity. But as the gift of Christ was, as Mr. F—r allows, a <HI>free gift</HI> and of <HI>free grace,</HI> God was under no <HI>obligations</HI> to give us Christ, or to provide any Saviour for mankind. Conse∣quently he might <HI>justly have with-held</HI> the gift of a Saviour, and left mankind with a <HI>needs must</HI> in the eternal death of every one of Adam's poster∣ity; and of all mankind after the sail. Does not this author then oppose <HI>himself</HI> in opposing the doctrine of Absolute necessity?
<Q>We must re∣nounce the mistakes of rigid Calvinists, (says he) or give up the doctrines of justice.</Q>
It appears to me as though some of the followers of Mr. F—r must renounce some of his mis∣takes, or give up the doctrine of <HI>perfection.</HI></P>
<P>In short; according to <HI>one part</HI> of this author's scheme, the great necessity of a Saviour to man∣kind, arises from their being under an absolute necessity of sinning, of being guilty, blamable,
<PB N="21" REF="026710_0019_0FD1632E064DEFF8"/>
perishable and condemned forever without one. So that not only the necessity, but even the grace of the gospel to Adam's posterity, is founded up∣on this <HI>very supposition</HI> that God might justly have blamed and punished his creatures, for doing that which they would have been under an abso∣lute necessity of doing; and for being what they would have been under an absolute necessity of being. At the same time this writer has founded <HI>another important part</HI> of his scheme upon the <HI>supposition</HI> or <HI>principle,</HI> That God cannot, and never could in any case, consistently with his per∣fections, blame or punish his creatures for doing or being what they could not avoid.</P>
<P>Does then this author help the matter in the least by saying, that God has freely given to man∣kind a Saviour, to free them from that absolute necessity of sinning, and of perishing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they would otherwise have been under? On the con∣trary; Does he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> make the matter worse? Does not the very gift of a Saviour show that all the posterity of Adam were in a <HI>lost, helpless,</HI> and <HI>undone</HI> condition? Does not the gift of a Saviour prove that they <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> possibly</HI> have avoided sin go <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blame and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> without one? Consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not prove that God might justly have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the posterity of Adam in a state of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>necessary</HI> guilt, blame and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> if it were, as Mr F—r <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a gra∣cious gift <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> course <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Saviour, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="22" REF="026710_0020_0FD1632F4C93CD88"/>
that, in this way, he has, if possible, entangled it the more.</P>
<P>And indeed he himself appears to have been in some measure sensible of the impossibility of re∣conciling his jaring principles in this way. We therefore find him quitting this ground, and hav∣ing recourse to another expedient. But let us follow him.</P>
<P><Q>And we assert (says he in Vol. iv. page 38) that if God had not graciously designed to re∣place all mankind in a state of initial salvation from sin and hell, according to the various dis∣pensations of his redeeming grace, he would have punished Adam's sin by a personal damna∣tion. Nor would he have suffered him to propagate his fallen race, unless the second Adam had extended the blessings of redemption so far as to save from eternal misery all who die in their infancy; and to put all who live long enough to act as moral agents, in a capa∣city of avoiding hell by working out their own eternal salvation in the day of their temporary salvation; a day this, which inconsistent Cal∣vinists call the day of grace.</Q></P>
<P>Here is something extraordinary indeed for one who has boasted of his talents at reasoning as Mr. F—r. Here we see him, so far from standing his ground, that he is evidently giving way to this grand difficulty attendending his scheme. He tells us that if a Saviour had not been provided, God would not have suffered Adam to propagate his fallen race 'Tis as much as if he had said; God <HI>could</HI> consistently with his perfections, have suffered Adam to propagate his race in such a state that they might have been un∣der
<PB N="23" REF="026710_0021_0FD16330D39A20A0"/>
an absolute necessity of being sinful, guilty, blamable and justly punishable, had a Saviour ne∣ver been provided: But I do not believe he <HI>would</HI> have suffered it. This is granting that God could justly have blamed and punished Adam's posterity for doing that which they could not pos∣sibly have avoided; and for being such creatures as they would have been under an absolute neces∣sity of being. But how does this agree with the following assertion of his:
<Q>If, through the sa∣ving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endued with an aw∣ful power to chuse life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to punish or recom∣pense mankind, as to whip a dead horse for not moving, damn fire for burning, grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</Q>
In short, how does this agree with a principle upon which he has founded an important part of his scheme, (viz.) that "Absolute necessity and a righteous judgment are absolutely incompatible?"</P>
<P>But perhaps, Sir, you will say that Mr. F—r's meaning here was not that God <HI>could,</HI> but that he <HI>could not,</HI> consistently with his perfections, have suffered Adam thus to propagate his fallen race without providing a Saviour? Then it comes to this, that God, as soon as he suffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, was under <HI>obligations</HI> to provide a Saviour for all his posterity. But if so, how was the gift of a Saviour to mankind a purely free and gracious gift? It certainly was not, according to this, wholly of a free grace to Adams posterity</P>
<P>But as Mr. F—r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a free gift and a purely gracious gift
<PB N="24" REF="026710_0022_0FD163324C866FA8"/>
to all mankind; it follows that God might, con∣sistently with his justice and all his other attri∣butes, have suffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, without ever providing any Saviour for them. And then all the posterity of Adam would have been left under the first covenant: Accord∣ing to which
<Q>An absolute, unsinning, universal obedience in our own persons is required; and such obedience, we in our fallen state, (says this author) can never perform.</Q>
Suppose then God had never provided a Saviour, what would have been our condition? We should, if what he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be true, have been required by the Deity to perform that in our own persons which we never could have performed: Nay, all the posterity of Adam would have deserved God's wrath and damnation even for their original corruption And this they could not poss<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> have avoided, since it would have been brought upon them by their first parent Adam. Would not all the posterity of Adam then, have been upon Mr F—r's principles, justly blamable, punishable and damnable for that which they could not possibly have avoided? Let reason, candor and common sense judge. I once more then ask with what appearance of con∣sistency or propriety he could assert thus.
<Q>If through the saving grace of God which has ap∣peared to all men, we were not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endued with an awful power to chuse life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to punish or recompense mankind, as to whip a dead horse for not moving, dam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its flui∣dity?</Q>
Or with what prop<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assert, that
<Q>Absolute necessity and a righteous judg∣ment
<PB N="25" REF="026710_0023_0FD16333CC5DA640"/>
are absolutely incompatable?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus, (says this writer, Vol. ii. page 245) by looking at our divine compass, the word of God, we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through the straits of error, keeping at an equal distance from the rocks a∣gainst which Calvinists run on the right hand, and Pelagians on the left.</Q>
From Mr. F—r's steerage through the straits of error, one would suppose he looked at his divine compass blindfold∣ed: For he has made a very crooked path; and is in my humble opinion, taken up by a rock at last. And over this rock, I presume, he will never run. Sir, do you not think, that this au∣thor ought first to have cast the beam out of his own eye, before he had undertaken to pull the mote out of other peoples eyes? That is; ought he not to have reconciled Mr. F—r with Mr. F—r, before he had undertaken to reconcile the Calvinists and Arminians by endeavoring to persuade them to embrace his plan.</P>
<P>What has this author said to extricate himself from this dilemma? I can find nothing. From his having recourse first to one solution of the difficulty and then to another, 'tis evident he felt his scheme in distress. He did not fall into this grand inconsistency by mere inattention. He was necessarily and unavoidably driven to it, in case he held the free grace of the gospel and his favorite principle, that
<Q>Absolute necessity and a righteous judgment are absolutely incompati∣ble:</Q>
For if, in supporting this principle, he had been consistent with himself throughout his writings, he must have said, at all times, that God could never, if a Saviour had not been
<PB N="26" REF="026710_0024_0FD163354E0C6B98"/>
provided, have required more of the posterity of Adam, than they could have done. And if so; they might have obtained righteousness by the law: For they could have done what they could. And, upon this principle, God could have required no more. And
<Q>If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness. (says the Apostle) should have been by the law.</Q>
Gal. iii 21. And,
<Q>If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</Q>
Gal. ii. 21. Thus to all Adam's posterity Christ would have been dead in vain. This consequence would have been mani∣fest to the most <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if this author had been consistent with himself with regard to his favorite principle: Nay more; he must have expressly contradicted his first gospel axiom that
<Q>All our salvation is of God in Christ, and there∣fore of grace.</Q>
Upon this principle, our sal∣vation would not have been in Christ; and at the same time of grace: For all the posterity of A∣dam could have discharged the whole of their du∣ty without Christ. Consequently, they could have obtained salvation without Christ.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, this author had univer∣sally granted moral necessity to be consistant with blame and punishment, praise and reward, then he would had little or no room left to object a∣gainst the absolute decrees of God, the sove∣reignty of grace and the like. His prejudices therefore against the truth led him to contradict himself; and adopt two principles, both of which are essential to his scheme, and yet at eternal war with each other. This then is your much boast∣ed
<PB N="27" REF="026710_0025_0FD16336EDA07350"/>
of Mr. F—r with all his triumphing and parade of learning.</P>
<P>I have not attempted to point out but <HI>one</HI> con∣tradiction in this author's works. And if any person will show me that here is not a contradic∣tion; then I will show him a number of places in which he his in fact contradicted both himself and the scriptures. But I suppose it would not trouble in the least, those who agree with Mr. F—r, if I were to point out a thousand con∣tradictions in his works. For
<Q>Opposite doc∣drines are (says he), as essential to the fulness of Christ's gospel, as the two eyes, nostrails, and cheeks, which compose our faces, are es∣sential to the completeness of human beauty.</Q>
See vol. iii. page 241. No wonder then that this writer holds to opposite doctrines in support∣ing the gospel. Indeed he is perfectly right if this be the case: If there be opposite doctrines in the gospel he must necessarily hold to opposite doctrines, if he mean to support the gospel. But Sir, what sort of a gospel is Mr. F—. endeavoring to support? He calls it <HI>Christ</HI>'s gos∣pel. But surely he cannot mean the gospel of Christ <HI>Jesus</HI> the <HI>righteous,</HI> the eternal Son of God, who spake as never man spake? No; he must have found some <HI>new Christ</HI> whose gospel with opposite doctrines he is laboring to support. And whose new gospel can this be? By looking at the front-page of the first volume, we find he has given his works the following title:
<Q>A Vindica∣tion of the Rev. Mr. Westey's Last Minutes.</Q>
We see then whose gospel Mr. F—r is labouring to support. This must undoubtedly be the gos∣pel to whose fulness opposite doctrines are so very
<PB N="28" REF="026710_0026_0FD163384CB38E70"/>
essential. And no doubt this was the "compas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at which Mr. F—r looked when he underto<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to fall through the straits of error. No wond<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then he has split upon a rock and made shipwre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. And no wonder that many others who take t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> compass for a guide, finally make shipwreck <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only with respect to a scheme of christian doc¦trines, but even of faith and good conscience.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, you are ready to object he<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and say that I have not as yet attempted so mu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as to show where the truth lies, as to prove th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mr. F—r has contradicted himself? I acknow¦ledge it. Nor would it be consistent with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present design of brevity, to go into a full expla¦nation of the subject respecting natural and mo¦ral necessity and inability. However, that y<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may not conceive erroniously with regard to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sentiments, and that I may, as far as I am capable help you to a knowledge of the truth, I wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> give you as concisely as possible, my ideas upon t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> subject with some of my reasons for believing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I do.</P>
<P>There are two general kinds of necessity a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> inability. One is called <HI>natural.</HI> It has refere<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to nature as the word is used in opposition to th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will. If a person be unable to do an action, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be under a necessity of not doing it, for want <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bodily powers, understanding or some natural fa¦culty, he is under a natural necessity of not doing it. His inability to do this action is of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ral kind. And we readily grant that such an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ability and such a necessity are absolutely incon¦sistent with commands and prohibitions, prai<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and blame, rewards and punishments.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="026710_0027_0FD1633A919CD5B8"/>The other kind of necessity and inability is called <HI>moral</HI>; because it has reference to the heart or will, which is the moral faculty. To illustrate this, let us suppose a person should be commanded to do an action which he could not do; not for want of bodily powers, understand∣ing or any natural faculty, but wholly for want of a <HI>will</HI> or heart to do it. This person would be under a moral necessity of not doing this ac∣tion. His inability to do it would be wholly of the moral kind. Thus,
<Q>They that are in the flesh (that is, in an unregenerate state) cannot please God.</Q>
Rom. viii. 8. But why? Is it for want of bodily powers, or any natural facul∣ty? No; but only for want of a will to please him. Their inability, therefore, to please God is wholly of the <HI>moral</HI> kind. And if God should give these persons a will to love him, so as to please him, and should maintain this will in them, they would be under a <HI>moral necessity</HI> of loving and pleasing God.</P>
<P>This <HI>moral</HI> kind of necessity and inability may be as absolute as the <HI>natural.</HI> And in many res∣pects it resembles the <HI>natural</HI> kind. But it is ve∣ry different in its nature. For the most <HI>absolute moral</HI> necessity and inability are perfectly consist∣ent with commands and prohibitions, praise and blame, rewards and punishments: Whereas, <HI>na∣tural</HI> necessity and inability are absolutely incon∣sistent with these things.</P>
<P>That absolute <HI>moral</HI> necessity and inability are perfectly consistent with praise and reward, ap∣pears from the state of the Deity: For the scrip∣ture expressly declares that God cannot lie; and that the judge of all the earth cannot but do right.
<PB N="30" REF="026710_0028_0FD1633A97501808"/>
His will is perfectly holy. And he cannot have any other but a holy will. Consequently, he is under an absolute <HI>moral</HI> necessity of being holy. But no one, I presume, will pretend to say that God is not worthy of praise and reward for his holiness. It follows then that the most absolute moral necessity to do good, is perfectly consistent with praise and reward. The same appears from a consideration of the state of holy men and an∣gels in Heaven. And from the same considera∣tion it appears that absolute moral necessity to do good, and absolute moral inability to do evil, are consistent with commands and prohibitions: For though saints and angels in Heaven are under an absolute moral necessity of being holy, and an abso∣lute moral inability to do evil, yet they are all sub∣jects of commands and prohibitions. This is plain from the general tennor of scripture.</P>
<P>That absolute moral necessity to do good, so as to persevere in holiness, is consistent with praise and reward; commands and prohibitions, might be proved also from the state of those who are regenerated. For, "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; (says the apostle John) for his seed remaineth in him: And he cannot sin be∣cause he is born of God." But, Sir, if you will not allow this argument to be conclusive, you cannot deny but that I have mentioned some which are conclusive with regard to this matter.</P>
<P>Since then absolute <HI>moral</HI> necessity to do <HI>good</HI> is perfectly consistent with commands and prohi∣bitions, praise and reward, why should not abso∣lute <HI>moral</HI> necessity to do <HI>evil,</HI> be consistent with commands and prohibitions, blame and punish∣ment? No reason I presume can be given. But
<PB N="31" REF="026710_0029_0FD1633C0C9C0700"/>
there is no need of resting the matter here: For the arguments to prove this fact are various, and such as amount, I conceive to absolute demonstra∣tion. I will mention two or three; of which I desire particular notice may be taken.</P>
<P>In the first place then. All, I presume, will agree to the following propositions. God com∣mands all mankind to render at all times universal obedience to the law we are under; to live and the entirely free from sin And he considers us blamable and punishable for every transgression, however small. But for want of good hearts all mankind cannot thus render at all times, universal obedience. Notwithstanding all Christ has done, 'tis impossible for all mankind to live and die mo∣ral agents without transgressing the law they are under some time or other It follows then that absolute moral necessity to do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is consistent with commands, with blame and punishment. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> inevitably follows, if there be, or ever has been a single individual of mankind thus under necessity from an evil heart, of trans∣gressing at any time, in any instance, the law he is or was under, whether that be the law of li∣berty, the Mosaic or Adamic law. Indeed, it is so far from being the case that <HI>all</HI> mankind can thus live and die without sinning, that <HI>no mere</HI> man since the last ever has been or ever will be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> notwithstanding all Christ has done, thus to render universal obedience from the time he be∣came or shall become a moral agent to the time of his death All, on account of evil <HI>hearts,</HI> do <HI>necessarily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> sin sooner or later. This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evident from scripture. And it is what Mr. F—r himself allows in a great
<PB N="32" REF="026710_0030_0FD1633E1FB5E3B0"/>
variety of places, as every one must be sensible who has ever read his works. It appears then to a demonstration that moral necessity to do evil, and moral inability to do good, are perfectly con∣sistent with commands and prohibitions, blame and punishment. The same appears from a consider∣ation of the state of the devils and damned, and of those who are given up to a reprobate mind: For they are all blamable and punishable, not on∣ly for the sins which brought them into that state, but also for those which they now commit; and which they are under an absolute necessity of committing. From a great variety of such argu∣ments and from many express passages of scripture to this effect that, "They that are in the flesh cannot please God," and that many cannot, like the apostle, do the things that they would and ought to do; 'tis evident that absolute moral ne∣cessity to do evil, and absolute moral inability to do good, are perfectly consistent with commands and prohibitions, blame and punishment. The same then we may safely lay down as an eternal maxim of truth abundantly taught in the holy oricles of God</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if you will take this maxim; and make it your compass, as being a plain doctrine of scripture, you will steer clear of the rock up∣on which Mr. F—r has split, and made ship∣wreck. And I presume you can avoid it in no other way: For suppose God had suffered Adam to propagate his fallen race without ever provid∣ing a Saviour for them. They would as Mr. F—r tells us, have had nothing but <HI>helplessness;</HI> nothing but <HI>sin.</HI> They must necessarily have gone on in sin and wickedness. But this necessity
<PB N="33" REF="026710_0031_0FD1633F0E2A5BA8"/>
would have been wholly of the <HI>moral</HI> kind; or such as would have proceeded from the <HI>state</HI> of their wills. And such a necessity we have found to be perfectly consistent with blame and punish∣ment, and consequently with a righteous judge∣ment. Therefore, God could, consistently with his perfections, have blamed and punished the fal∣len race of Adam, for their actual and personal wickedness; notwithstanding they would have been under an absolute <HI>moral</HI> necessity of com∣mitting it. Allowing this to be the case, we may clearly see how it is that, after the fall, righteous∣ness could not come by the law to any man. Con∣sequently we may see the great necessity of a Saviour, and also the grace there is in the gift of Christ as a redeemer.</P>
<P>From what I have here said, you may form some idea, Sir, of the great distinction which is made between <HI>natural</HI> necessity and inability, and <HI>moral</HI> I have here but just hinted to you the dif∣ference. If you are disposed to make further enquiery respecting this matter, I would refer you to what President Edwards has said upon the subject in his piece on the human will. The whole of it is worthy of your close attention. At the same time, by reading this book, and comparing the same with your favorite author's representa∣tion of it, you will see for yourself one of Mr. F—r's gross misrepresentations. The most charitable conclusion is that this writer had never read it.</P>
<P>From what I have here suggected you may see also, if you act a candid part, where the fallacy lies of Mr. F—r's reasoning against the Calvi∣nistic
<PB N="34" REF="026710_0032_0FD163408C4501A8"/>
doctrines of the sovereignty of grace, the absolute decrees of God, regeneration, faith and repentance. The whole force of a great part of his arguments against these doctrines, depends upon the truth of this one proposition, That there is no difference between <HI>moral</HI> necessity and inability, and <HI>natural,</HI> as to nature. In all his reasonings, declamations, and addresses to the passions of mankind with regard to these things, he made a practice of comparing the necessity and inability which arise from the state of the will or heart; to the necessity and inability which arise from the state of the bodily powers or natural faculties. That this is in fact the case every one must be sensible who has ever read this author's works.</P>
<P>But, Sir, where has Mr. F—r shown that these two kinds of necessity and inability are not thus different in their nature? He has not so much as attempted it in any of his works whch I have read: Whereas this ought to have been one of his first steps. Since, therefore, he has taken no notice of this distinction between <HI>natural</HI> necessity and <HI>moral,</HI> we who make it, and maintain that it is taken from scripture, shall, till it is shown to be groundless, consider as vain and futile all his argu∣ments, declamations, and addresses whose whole force depend upon there being no such distinction in nature. The greater part of the learned world make this distinction. And I trust that the scrip∣tures make it. And it is a distinction upon which much indeed depends. If, therefore, you would act a fair and candid part, never more use argu∣ments whose whole force depends upon there be∣ing
<PB N="35" REF="026710_0033_0FD163420E4E8D48"/>
no such distinction; till you have shown that it is groundless.</P>
<P>Finally, from what has been said, you may see also how difficult it is to form a consistent scheme of religion, or to reconcile the doctrines of scrip∣ture with each other, without granting that <HI>mo∣ral</HI> necessity and <HI>moral</HI> inability are consistent with commands and prohibitions, praise and blame, rewards and punishments. No writer ever la∣boured harder perhaps to exclude all kinds of ne∣cessity and inability from his scheme, than Mr. F—r has done. But with what success, I leave for the candid, who may read what I have here written, to judge. For my own part I am fully and firmly of the opinion that the doctrines of scripture can be reconciled with each other, in no other way than by allowing that <HI>moral</HI> ne∣cessity to do evil is consistent with commands, with blame and punishment; and that <HI>moral</HI> neces∣sity to do good is consistent with commands, with praise and reward. But I profess to be one whole mind is open to conviction. And I hope that you will manifest yourself to be a serious and can∣did enquirer after divine truth. May He, then, who is the Wise Disposer of all events, lead to a saving knowledge of the truth, you,</P>
