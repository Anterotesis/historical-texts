<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NOVELS, as giving a just idea of the dictates of the heart, and of the under∣standing, according as each is more or less addicted to some passion, may be considered as very useful, especially when conducted with art sufficient to instruct at the same time that they amuse; and as our design is here to paint the fatal effects of Jealousy, we could not pitch upon an instance that is a fuller demon∣stration of the excesses to which a jealous and criminal heart sometimes abandons itself, than the following Novel, which is said to be founded on fact.</P>

<HEAD>Fatal Effects of Jealousy.</HEAD>
<P>DON RAMIRO had been brought up in his infancy with young Isabella Mendosa, who was destined to be his wife. He loved her from a child. His passion for her increased with his years, and grew stronger with his reason. He was too amiable a person not to be beloved. Isabella re∣quited tenderness for her with the sincerest re∣turn; and every thing promised the two lovers all they wished for, when cruel fortune made them suffer the severest trials.</P>
<P>The Count de St. Estevan saw Isabella, and fell in love with her to distraction: He believed too, that, if he did but ask the consent of her parents, he should easily obtain her in marriage; for he was rich, had an honorable post at court, was of a very ancient family; and, as such considerable ad∣vantages pleaded in his favor, he actually made a proposal to Isabella's parents to marry her; but he had not the answer which he expected. The
<PB N="6" REF="047415_0004_1023A0D8F793BCC8"/>
Marquis de Mendosa said, "He had long since promised his daughter to Don Ramiro, and that he could not prevail on himself to break his word, were the offer made to him ever so advantage∣ous.</P>
<P>This denial was a sensible mortification to the Count de St. Estevan, but did not daunt him. The impatience of obtaining a good thing which if refused to us renders it precious to us, and the heart is never in a greater flutter than when it is agitated with the fear of losing the object with which it is charmed. The Count laid his scheme to interest the court in his favor, and hoped that the Marquis de Mendosa, who he knew was a crafty politician would alter his purpose, as soon as he saw it would be pleasing to the Prince upon the throne. He set his friends at work, and car∣ried his point.—The King ordered one of his Ministers to speak to the Marquis in the Count's favor. The Marquis immediately returned the same answer which he had given to the first pro∣posal of it; but it was conceived in such terms as made the Minister believe it was not impossible but he might at length comply with his desire. The view of the Marquis was that of an old Courtier. He was for enhancing the value of the sacrifice that was demanded of him. He was sensible that if he made no concession to the Mi∣nister, and appeared at the same time in a per∣plexity how to act, the King would speak to him about the affair himself.</P>
<P>As he foresaw, so it happened. The King spoke to him in favor of the Count de St. Este∣van, and urged the matter very home. The
<PB N="7" REF="047415_0005_1023A0DB8D022B70"/>
crafty Courtier seemed to be in great tribulation, yet put on a submissive air, and made answer, "That he thought his Majesty did him too great an honor by condescending to interest himself in the concerns of his family." "I am much plea∣sed, (said the King) with your obedience, and will take care you shall find your account by it in due time and place." These last words compleat∣ed the misfortunes of the unhappy Don Ramiro. From that very instant the Marquis was resolv∣ed to sacrifice him to his ambition. He thought himself the propere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> person to acquaint him of his misfortune, and took all the care possible to sweeten the bitter pill: Therefore, before he discovered the matter to him, he made a long speech upon the sad necessity that persons attach∣ed to the court were under of conforming to the desires of their Prince. In short, he told Don Ramiro, that, by an order from court, he must resign all thoughts of possessing Isabella. Don Ramiro's astonishment as well as sorrow was such that he could make no answer. There are some situations so dismaying, that the rejection of the heart throws a sudden cloud over the understand∣ing; and then both seem alike insensible, because the grief with which they are affected takes too deep root for them to give outward marks of it, and the soul must have some time to recover a power of acting. Don Ramiro came to himself again, and looking sternly at the Marquis de Mendosa. "I thought, (said he) that the re∣peated and solemn promises you made to me would have been my sure protection from the injury which you now do me. You desire me never to
<PB N="8" REF="047415_0006_1023A0DDECF8AA30"/>
think more of Isabella: You endeavor to persuade me that you are forced to obey the King: but are you not Isabella's father, and consequently is she not at your disposal? The King is just, and, if you had but represented to him that you could not in honor break your engagement with me, he would not have required of you to commit an ac∣tion that would stain your reputation."</P>
<P>Don Ramiro was going on in this strain, but the harsh terms he made use of gave such a shock to the vanity of the Marquis, that with a scorn∣ful air, he returned him a rough answer, and left him abruptly. He was so exasperated against him, that he was no sooner alone but he ordered his daughter to be sent for. He had not yet in∣formed her of her misfortune, because he tho't it proper to have that previous conversation with Don Ramiro. The moment Isabella appeared before him, he said to her, with some sharpness, "Daughter▪ I make no doubt but you have the love and respect for me that you owe to me. You must, this moment give me a substantial proof of it, by renouncing Don Ramiro. The King com∣mands me to dispose of you to the Count de St. Estevan; and what I demand of you is, that you look upon Don Ramiro as a man that I hate, and one that has offended me." Isabella was so ter∣rified at the thoughts of her destiny, that she could not help uttering her complaints, though it was at the hazard of disgusting her father. When misfortunes are come to a certain pitch, they in∣spire the weakest souls with courage; and the prospect of losing all that is dear to us is general∣ly attended with a resolution to run all risq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es
<PB N="9" REF="047415_0007_1023A0DF87F3F320"/>
for preserving it. "Were you to disapprove of my tears ever so much, said Isabella, permit me, dear father, to vent them in abundance. If I am unfortunate, it cannot be owing to any cause, but the submission I always paid to your commands. I scarce knew what I was before you brought me acquainted with Don Ramiro; you disposed of my heart in his favour; you desired I would give it up to him entirely. You told me day after day that you should judge of my obedience to you by the degree of love which I entertained for him. You commanded me to consider him as a spouse, that ought to be the dearer to me, because he was of your own ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing. Alas! could I dispute or∣ders that were so positive? Could I foresee that you would one day be so cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to revoke them? I have pursued, nay, intirely abandoned myself to the inclinations with which you inspired me; I have only lived, for several years past, in hopes of having a spouse in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ramiro, whose adresses, complaisance, and amiable qualities, have deserv∣ed all my love. And would you now require me, that I should forget him all at once, and pluck that image out of my heart, which you yourself have engraved in it? Oh! father, by these knees of your's, which I now embrace, recall an order which is death to me. Take pity of an unhappy daughter, who has not deserved to be so, and whose misfortunes it is in your power to put an end to. You gave me life: was it to render it miserable? You make me no answer, you look another way. Alas! father, let me therefore ex∣pire at your feet, and thereby put a period to the
<PB N="10" REF="047415_0008_1023A0E11069CC28"/>
cruel situation in which you have cast me. You know how dearly I love Don Ramiro. You know the affection and esteem I have for yourself. You demand, that I should recall my heart from Don Ramiro: What would you have me do in this sad dilemma? Being reduced as I am to the hard ne∣cessity of failing in my duty to you, or betraying my lover; death is the only resource I have left."</P>
<P>"Your obstinacy, replied the Marquis, deserves to be punished, and I ought to make you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my authority, that you may learn the better to con∣troul your inclination. I will leave you a little longer time to indulge your grief, after which I'll be obeyed, and admit of no farther plea. The Count de St. Estevan shall pay you a visit; and prepare yourself to receive him as a person for whom you are allotted."</P>
<P>These last words completed. Isabella's despair, and her grief was almost turned of fury; but it was checked by the presence of her father, tho' it did not hinder her from discovering how deeply she was in love. "No, said she, father, I can∣not resolve to abandon Don Ramiro, Exert all the authority you have over me; make me feel the effects of your indignation: I am ready to sub∣mit to every thing; and, since I am come to a re∣solution not to obey the will of a father whom I adore, I fear not the worst that can happen, but look upon it as a trifle, in comparison with the object which has made you hate me."</P>
<P>The Marquis, perceiving his daughter inflexible, was resolved to act with severity, "Well then, said he, since you will not obey me, I will find ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="11" REF="047415_0009_1023A0E3F200FAC8"/>
a way to prevent you from seeing Don Ramiro. I give you twenty-four hours time to determine your choice, either of the Count de St. Estevan, or a Convent." "The most cruel imprisonment, replied Isabella, will be a pleasure to me, as it will save me from the horrid fate of being the wife of any other man in the world, if I cannot have Don Ramiro." "Withdraw, replied the Marquis, I begin to be out of patience with your obstinacy, and you trespass too far upon my forbearance." Isabella retired from her father's apartment to her own, to give full vent to her grief.</P>
<P>Nature has certain prerogatives, which the hardest hearts cannot resist. When the Marquis de Mendosa was left alone, he could not but feel the secret reproach of his conscience for the bar∣barity with which he had treated his daughter; but this remorse of his, though there was so just an occasion for it, did not last long. Isabella was ignorant, in the mean time, whether Don Rami∣ro was a sharer in her trouble. Her father had not let her into the secret of his disgust with him, nor did she know the occasion of the enmity be∣twixt two persons that were so dear to her. Though she could not speak to her lover, she re∣solved to write to him. She acquainted him of the injunction laid upon her not to see him any more, and painted her condition with all its hor∣rors. The domestic who carried her letter brought back an answer to it. She then perceiv∣ed she was unfortunate to the last degree. Don Ramiro, conjured her, by the love she had for him, not to forget him; and assured her, that his
<PB N="12" REF="047415_0010_1023A0EAB477A400"/>
life was in her hands, and that he would hold it by no other tenure than her constancy.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro's grief was no small addition to Isabella's How to alter her condition she could not devise; nothing occurred to her thoughts, but what was gloomy and a afflicting; yet she ima∣gined a convent was the best place, for there she hoped to receive tidings from Don Ramiro, with more ease than she could at home; At least she was sure of not being teazed by the Count de St. Estevan, whom she looked upon as the only cause of her misfortunes. She had also some faint hopes, that, in time her father might alter his mind. How great soever the perplexity of the mind is, yet, till the evil is apprehended actually happens, there always remains some glimmer of hope. The understanding and the heart, which are so often at variance in good fortune, unite their for∣ces in adversity, to assist each other.</P>
<P>Isabella, being resolved to go into a convent, did not think it proper to stay for another melan∣choly conversation with her father. She imparted her design to one of the women of her bed-cham∣ber, and, having contrived a way to leave the house without being perceived, she stepped into a coach that waited for her, and drove to an Ab∣bey, where the Abbess was her intimate friend and relation.</P>
<P>When the Marquis de Mendosa heard that Isa∣belly was gone off, he posted with his complaint to the King, not so much out of a fondness to see his daughter, as to convince the Sovereign of the vigour with which he had acted in obedience to his orders. When he spoke to him he exaggera∣ted
<PB N="13" REF="047415_0011_1023A0EC408865F8"/>
the struggle he had within his breast to sur∣mount a fatherly tenderness, and concluded by assuring him that he was too sensible how much it was his duty to conform to his intentions, to suf∣fer himself to he biassed by the tears of his daugh∣ter. The King seemed pleased with the conduct of the Marquis, yet he was not willing that the sanctuary which Isabella had chosen should be vi∣olated: "She'll be weary, (said he to the Mar∣quis) of such a melancholy retirement; and you will find her hereafter more tractable, and more submissive to your commands."</P>
<P>The Marquis overjoyed that he had made his court so well, thought of nothing now but how to break off all correspondence betwixt his daugh∣ter and Don Ramiro. He petitioned the court that the Abbess might be obliged to receive a wo∣man into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he convent that was a creature of his, in order that she might be a spy upon Isabella. His suit was granted, and the nuns were ordered to prevent any correspondence between Don Ramiro and Isabella.</P>
<P>The Count de St. Estevan was too much in love with her, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to be offended at the aversion she discovered to him. He was not ignorant of the cause of it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> man but he would have thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>king off a passion which could not but render him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>appy: but he was too vain and presumptuous to think to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He thought it impossible but that Isabella must fall in love with him sooner or later. His birth and his riches had made him intolerably conceited; and he was likewise obstinate, passionate and Jealous. He sent to Isabella several times to desire she
<PB N="14" REF="047415_0012_1023A0EDC81B5CF8"/>
would give him leave to visit her at the grate; but she always refused him, and not without scorn. These marks of hatred and contempt ex∣asperated the Count, who was now resolved to hasten his marriage, and to prepare for removing every obstacle that opposed it. His vanity was so offended, that it made him consider Isabella's charms with no other view than to render him unhappy; and he was so base a man as to enter∣tain a desire of marrying her as much out of spite as love. After he had considered with himself a long while what course he should take to accom∣plish his design he thought of none so expedient as that of removing Don Ramiro at a good distance from Isabella; which, how difficult soever, he did not think impossible: Fortune favored him, a few days after this resolution, with an opportu∣nity which he could not have flattered himself with the hopes of.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro had found means, notwithstand∣ing the Marquis de Mendosa's precautions, and the vigilence of the woman whom he had placed in the convent to be a spy upon her, to write to Isabella, and to receive letters from her. This correspondence had lasted some weeks. The nun, who was her confident, being very much pressed to it by Don Ramiro, proposed to Isabella to see him in private, and gave her such hopes of the success of the assignation, that she could not with∣stand her longings to see the lover from whom she was parted. It was agreed that Don Ramiro should come in the night time, over such a part of the garden walls as was not so high as the rest, and return after his visit the same way. In short,
<PB N="15" REF="047415_0013_1023A0EF902CABB8"/>
every thing seemed to be so well concerted, that 'twas thought impossible for any accident to de∣feat it.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, having received the letter where∣by Isabella advertis'd him of the time and place of repairing to the garden, did not fail of go∣ing thither according to the appointment; but as his ill luck would have it, when he was got upon the wall, he was discovered by a person who was walking with two servants behind him, in the street next to the garden. This person was a par∣ty too much concerned to know who was got in∣to the convent to leave any stone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turned for stopping him. Therefore he sent for the watch, and posted it at the very place where he imagined Don Ramiro was to come back. After he had made this disposition, the Count de St. Estevan, for he was the person, sent to acquaint the nuns that there was a man in the garden.</P>
<P>The time which it necessarily took up to get the convent open in the night, gave Don Ramiro leisure to fall at the feet of his dear Isabella, and to say the tenderest things to her in the phrase of a lover. She, in her turn assured him that no∣thing could rend him from her heart, and that she had rather live and die in a convent than become the wife of the Count de St. Estevan.</P>
<P>While these two lovers little thinking of the fresh misfortune that threatened them, were giv∣ing each other the most reciprocal marks of their love, they heard a confused noise in the convent, which obliged them to separate. Don Ramiro hastened to make his retreat over the wall; but no sooner was he got down, than the men who
<PB N="16" REF="047415_0014_1023A0F41DEAB4E8"/>
had been posted there for the purpose rushed up∣on him, and, without giving him time to prepare for his defence, took away his sword, and then in the King's name charged him to follow them. The Captain of the watch caused him to be com∣mitted afterwards to prison, and drew up an in∣formation against him, which he laid next day be∣fore the Solicitor General.</P>
<P>The Count de St. Estevan, though the sole author of the misfortune that happened to Don Ramiro, did not appear to have had any hand in it; for the man he had sent for the watch, and he who gave notice to the nuns, were both un∣known. It was mere accident that brought the Count into this street, just as Don Ramiro was clambering the wall; and it was jealousy which made him believe that it could be no body but his rival. He knew of what importance it was to get him arrested, and imagined now that his ruin was unavoidable, the violation of the walls of a con∣vent being in Spain a capital crime. His design succeeded but too well. The lawyers prepared his indictment, and the death of Don Ramiro was next to a certainty. He had not a word to plead in his excuse, and he had the positive evidence of all those who had taken him. This affair was the talk of the whole city of Madrid, where Don Ramiro was generally beloved; All men of hon∣our pitied him, and solicited for him, but scarce hoped for any success.</P>
<P>The sorrowful Isabella was almost distracted, and reproached herself that she had been the cause of the ruin of her lover. The melancholy to which she abandoned herself was such, that
<PB N="17" REF="047415_0015_1023A0F838D3DA00"/>
her friends dreaded it would put a period to her days. Her father the Marquis de Mendosa was alarmed at it; and the Count de St. Estevan who was informed of it by a nun he had bribed, ima∣gined that Isabella would not long survive Don Ramiro. He had too great an affection for her to seek her destruction, and resolved to employ his own and his friends credit to save Don Rami∣ro's life. He had hitherto done every thing that was in his power underhand, to ruin him; and though he now left off his intrigues, yet he was still in hopes of making his rival's misfortune sub∣servient to his purpose of obtaining Isabella. He imparted his design to the Marquis de Mendosa, and made him sensible that it would not be impos∣sible to procure a pardon for Don Ramiro, pro∣vided that Isabella would forget him. The Marquis approved of the Count's proposal, and promised to speak of it to his daughter. He re∣paired to the convent, and having sent for his daughter, desired to speak with her alone. The grief with which you are oppressed, said he, melts my heart into compassion, and I will, if possible, put a stop to it. You dread the thoughts of Don Ramiro's death; you reproach yourself with be∣ing the cause of the sentence which is soon to be passed upon him, while it is in your power not only give him life but to restore him to liberty. "Alas! my father, cried Isabella, if Don Rami∣ro is to live, I am happy indeed! What, shall I be so fortunate as to pluck him from the unhap∣py fate that attends him? Can I preserve that life to him which he is to lose through my im∣prudence?
<PB N="18" REF="047415_0016_1023A0F9C5DE9FE0"/>
Nay, can I also restore him to liber∣ty with life? Say but the word, father, there's nothing that I will not do."—"One word is sufficient, (replied the Marquis) and you save Don Ramiro: One single yea delivers him out of pri∣son. The Count de St. Estevan desires to have you in marriage. The King countenances his suit. Do you but give your content, and Don Ra∣miro is free." "It, (said Isabella, dissolving in tears) if that is the only way I have left to save Don Ramiro's life, I rather chuse to die with him; he loves me too well to consent to live upon such a condition as that, and would be sorry that I had prevented his death by such a concession. Oh! Father, (continued she, throwing herself at his feet) by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se knees which I now embrace, by that love which you once had for me; by that tender respect which I always had for you, and which I shall carry to my grave, take pity on your unhappy daughter: May her tears affect you. These, alas! for above three months past, have been my only resource, my only relief. Permit me to go and end those days, which are a burden to me, far from Don Ramiro, and far from the Count. You expect that I should put out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of love which yourself ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled. Though I cannot obey you—though Don Rami∣ro's image cannot be effaced out of my heart, I will, however, for your satisfaction, behave in such a manner, as it I was no longer in love with the object of your displeasure. Let Don Rami∣ro live in the world, while, for my own part, I retire to some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from that would where∣in I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. You make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no
<PB N="19" REF="047415_0017_1023A0FDDD10E718"/>
answer, father; what have I done to deserve this harshness with which you cast me down?"</P>
<P>"Daughter, (replied the Marquis, at the same time that he raised up Isabella from her knees) it is not from anger that I do not make you an an∣swer; it is because I have nothing to say for your comfort, as glad as I should be to assuage your grief and to save Don Ramiro. Your hand is the price of his life, and upon no other condition can his pardon be granted. He will be indebted for it to the Count de St. Estevan, who by his marriage with you takes upon him to obtain it of the King, though his Majesty has refused it to all others who have solicited it. The time is very pressing, and perhaps when you would be glad to save Don Ramiro's life it may be too late: His sentence is just ready to be passed; after which it will not not be possible to prevent the execution of it. If his life be as dear to you as you say it is, hasten to save it."—" If it be dear to me! repli∣ed Isabella, good God! can you so much as doubt of it? Have you not taken sufficient care to en∣dear him to me? You opened that frightful abyss into which you have now plunged me, when I was but an infant. Since it must be so, I am re∣solved to perish: I will die and Don Ramiro will follow me to the grave. He has too great an af∣fection for me to take it amiss of me that I did not save a life which he could not spend with me." "Very well, replied the Marquis, with some bitterness, your obstinacy will meet with its due reward; and, since you are willing that Don Ramiro shall die, you shall have your desire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I will go myself to hasten it, and to demand justice
<PB N="20" REF="047415_0018_1023A100A18275F0"/>
for the offront he has put upon me, and the in∣delible stain with which he has disgraced you. I will join issue with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nuns who prosecute him, and animate all that seek his ruin." The Mar∣quis had no sooner said this than he was retiring; but Isabella cried out to him with a faint and al∣most dying voice, "Stay, father, stay, Don Ramiro's life must be saved: no <HI>I</HI> cannot con∣sent that he should perish; <HI>I</HI> could not have con∣ceived the horror that <HI>I</HI> felt, just as you was go∣ing to part from me; all the misfortunes that op∣press me are nothing to my anguish at the view of his approaching death, but how much more should <HI>I</HI> suffer by his death itself? Save Don Ramiro's life, <HI>I</HI> will obey." At these words Isabella fainted away. The Marquis called for persons to relieve her, who, with great difficulty brought her to herself; and then she desired to be carried to her chamber.</P>
<P>The Marquis satisfied with his daughter's pro∣mise, was not much concerned at her fainting fit, in which he thought there was no great danger, but looked on it as the last struggle of a passion, which her marriage with the Count de St. Estevan would quickly smother; and he went to carry him the news of his daughter's consent. The Count, overjoyed, that his project had succeeded so well, put his friends upon employing their interest at court; and the King granted Don Ramiro a par∣don: But before it was delivered to him, St. Es∣tevan was for concluding his marriage. The un∣fortunate Isabella was accordingly married to Don Ramiro's mortal enemy, whom yet the considered as his deliverer. The service which she imagined
<PB N="21" REF="047415_0019_1023A1022817BF88"/>
the Count had done Don Ramiro, rendered him less hateful in her eyes, and honour made her re∣solve to do every thing in her power to stifle a passion, which, after her marriage, she thought would be criminal. Nay, she was determined to try, by all means, to raise her affection for a hus∣band to whom she had only been married by com∣pulsion.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro had heard nothing of all this in his prison, where he was abandoned to the most melancholy ideas. He wished his Judges would hasten the moment of his death, and the thought of its being near at hand was the only comfort he had, at the time that the news was brought him that the king had signed his pardon. At first he imagined that Isabella's fate could not be un∣happy, since his own was so much mended; and this single thought was no small addition to his joy. Now then, said he, I will revisit the ado∣rable Isabella. I hope to have leave to die at her feet, and to atone for the misfortunes that <HI>I</HI> have brought upon her. "<HI>I</HI> advise you, said the per∣son who brought him his pardon, to avoid Isabel∣la's company; she will but increase your trou∣bles." "No, no said Don Ramiro, bluntly interrupting him, <HI>I</HI> make no account of life but to see, to love, and to adore, Isabella. If I were to renounce her, the pardon granted to me would be a cruel punishment." "But what hopes, re∣plied the person can you have now? For since she is married"—"What! married! said Don Ramiro. Ah! then <HI>I</HI> must die." His sorrow making his speech faulter, he was quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unk un∣der the weight of his misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="047415_0020_1023A103E1A77698"/>
In this state Don Ramiro remained for near a quarter of an hour; but, sorrow having at length recalled his soul to itself, his dejection was soon succeeded by rage. "What! said he, has Isa∣bella betrayed me? Has that Isabella, whose heart I always thought full of tenderness for me abandoned me? Has she even married my rival? Ah! cruel one, I will disappoint you, and you shall no longer feast your eyes with the grief of a lover whom you have drove to despair."</P>
<P>The person who had acquainted Don Ramiro with Isabella's marriage, not thinking that this news would have had such an effect upon him, endeavoured to pacify him by a vindication of I∣sabella's conduct. He knew that this amiable young lady only consented to marry the Count, in order to save Don Ramiro's life; he therefore gave him a particular detail of what his unfortu∣nate mistress had suffered, and of the necessity she was reduced to of giving her hand to the Count de St. Estevan for that very purpose.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro observed a pensive silence during the narrative of his dear Isabella's misfortunes, and his rage, by degrees▪ abated. Every token of his mistress's love made that impression upon his heart which reason operates on a mind that is somewhat disturbed. At length, the passion which he had for Isabella having recovered intire possession of his soul, he cried out, in a plaintive tone, "Alas! Why has she loved me to such a degree! Or rather, why did she not let me die? What shall I do with a life that I so much hate?"</P>
<P>While Don Ramiro was thus complaining, the officers of justice came to set him at liberty. He
<PB N="23" REF="047415_0021_1023A10895730720"/>
was so afflicted, that he made them no answer, but went out with them, plunged in deep medi∣tation, and, at the bottom of the steps of the prison in which he had been confined, found a coach, which carried him home. He no sooner set down, than he wrote a letter to Isabella, com∣plaining of his hard lot; but her answer made him more uneasy than before. He saw that she had still the same kindness for him; he was fully sensible of the sacrifice which she had made to save his life, yet this same Isabella was he obliged to shun; and death, which he thought the only remedy for his misfortunes, was not permitted him. In this sad situation Don Ramiro resolved to indulge melancholy till it put an end to his mis∣fortunes, and in this way did he live for above three months, when a man, altogether unknown to him, desired to speak with him. "<HI>I</HI> come, Sir, said he, to reveal a secret to you, which it highly concerns you to know. I was many years a domestic of the Count de St. Estevan, and it is not above a month since I left his service, <HI>I</HI> am now going to leave Madrid; else sooner or later, I shall feel the Counts resentment. Shall I tell you the very thing that has pushed him to ruin me? He is afraid le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I should acquaint you, that it was he who discovered you when you got over into the convent. He has always persecuted you since; and, while you was in prison, I went with him very often, to several of your judges, whom he solicited to ruin you. It is true he had a hand in procuring your pardon, when your mistress had consented to marry him. I hope you will not suffer the secret I tell you to be divulged be∣fore
<PB N="24" REF="047415_0022_1023A10C9E1A6FA8"/>
I am gone from Madrid. Nothing could save one from his fury if he knew that I had in∣formed you of his behaviour, he being in a con∣tinual alarm for fear his spouse should come to the knowledge of it."</P>
<P>While the domestic was pursuing his narrative, Don Ramiro was in a perfect rage. "The trea∣cherous wretch, said he, shall most certainly die; his imposture shall have its due reward"</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, without delay, prepared to put his menaces into execution. He wrote two let∣ters, one to Isabella, wherein he told her what her husband had done, and the other to the Count, inviting him to decide, without any one's privity, a quarrel, for which nothing could put an end, but the death of one of them.</P>
<P>Isabella was gone to pay a visit to her sister the Marchioness del Prado, when the domestic deli∣vered the letter to the Count. He was nettled at it to the last degree; and, though he was more brutish than brave, he was so animated by his pride and resentment, that without waiting for Isabella's return, he went out that very moment alone to the place appointed. The two antago∣nists were no sooner met, but without any parley they drew their swords and fought furiously. They had each received several wounds, but their rage hindered them from perceiving that they had lost blood. Don Ramiro vexed at meeting with such resistence, from a rival whom he despised as much as he hated, was determined to put an end by one push to a duel which had lasted so long, and, making a full pass at the Count, ran him in∣to the breast; but he received a slab in the bot∣tom
<PB N="25" REF="047415_0023_1023A10E25664F70"/>
of his belly, which was altogether as danger∣ous. These two last thrusts disabled the two com∣batants alike at one and the same time, and both lost so much blood that they could no longer stand on their feet, but fell down both together, the moment that a coach came to them.</P>
<P>Whose coach should this be but Isabella's, who, receiving Don Ramiro's letter when she came home, and finding upon enquiry, that her hus∣band was gone out alone, made no doubt but he had some duel on his hands. In her confusion she happened also to go into the Count's chamber, and perceived a letter on the table, which, by the hand-writing she guessed to be Don Ramiro's; and it was indeed the very challenge he had wrote to his rival. Isabella needed no farther informa∣tion to direct her to the place she was to go to. When she alighted out of the coach. She ran towards her husband, who hardly knew her, and was so weak, that he could not speak. Isabella turned her eyes every now and then to Don Ra∣miro, whose condition was altogether as danger∣ous. Duty engaged her to support her husband, love called her attention to her lover: her care was engaged for the Count, her wishes for Don Ramiro. She was sensible that she ought that instant to have carried her husband to town but then Don Ramiro would have been left without any manner of help. Love prevailed over de∣corum, and she staid till her servants had carried Don Ramiro to a neighbouring convent. The Count, as faint as he was, had sense enough to perceive what reasons his wife had for not return∣ing
<PB N="26" REF="047415_0024_1023A110F0AE3438"/>
with more speed to Madrid. These his jea∣lousy pointed to him in the blackest colours, and nothing but his being so faint hindered him from exclaiming against Isabella with the most bitter reproaches. The unfortunate Don Ramiro was sensible also of the obligations which he had to his mistress; and, though he spoke very low, and though Isabella made him no manner of answer, the Count suspecting that there was an under∣standing between them, and the more he reflect∣ed, the more he was confirmed in it; so that during the first days of his illness he thought of nothing else. His duel was not unknown at court; but, as neither his wounds nor those of Don Ra∣miro were mortal, justice took no cognizance of the matter, and there was no prosecution.</P>
<P>As soon as the Count de St. Estevan had reco∣vered spirits to shew his resentment. He rallied Isabella with all the sharpness that could be. "I do not know what you mean, replied Isabella, and, if you really imagine that I was any way concerned in your duel, you would be the most ungenerous of mortals." "Nay, replied the Count in a rage, it was you that fet on Don Ra∣miro to attack me. I saw the confusion of your countenance, when he was wounded. Regardless whether I lived or died, you thought of nothing but the danger you supposed he was in. He could not command his temper enough, not to express his grateful sense of it to you before my face: and I saw him thank you for it. My eyes ready to be closed for ever, exposed both my own disgrace and yours to me. But would to God I had been
<PB N="27" REF="047415_0025_1023A112D2D359E8"/>
strong enough at that instant to have stabbed your lover to the heart, and you after him!"</P>
<P>"I am not deaf, said <HI>I</HI>sabella with an Indig∣nant air, to the reproaches which you have cast upon me; reproaches as worthy of you as they are unworthy of me. My virtue defies the blackest calumney; nor do I fear the slander of the husband to whom cruel fortune has been pleased to join me. But, for my own satisfaction, I must tell you what perhaps you never yet knew. I loved Don Ramiro from my very infancy. The unhappy passion which you entertained for me de∣prived me of him for ever. I consented to mar∣ry you in order to save his life, and resolved from that time to banish him from my heart; but I perceived that my efforts were vain, and that his image haunted me wherever I went. Mean time I turned my duty into a severe law. Mean time I turned my duty into a severe law. I ordered Don Ramiro to keep out of my sight: <HI>I</HI> lived with you in the best manner I could; I fell in with every thing that I thought could please you, and even wished I could love you. When my heart was in so uneasy a situation, I learnt that you was the sole author of my misfortunes, and those of Don Ramiro. <HI>I</HI> find that it was you that caused him to be apprehended. <HI>B</HI>arbarous as it was; and as much an abhorrence as I have for so shocking a deed, I persevere in my duty, and my virtue is not shaken. I found by a letter lying on your table the place appointed for your duel with Don Ramiro. I ran thither to sepa∣rate you, but could not arrive soon enough. You reproach me for shewing a concern at the condi∣tion in which I saw my lover. I was concerned,
<PB N="28" REF="047415_0026_1023A1182C592A28"/>
no doubt, and am not ashamed to own it. Alas! why should I not pity a virtuous man; one who is truly worthy of being beloved, and who is un∣fortunate for my sake? Thus have you now heard what I had to say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o you."</P>
<P>At these words the Countess went out of her husband's chamber, and left him seemingly absorb∣ed in a profound reverie. The sincere confession which she had made put him into such a state, that he could not distinguish right and a wrong. He was smitten with the tokens which Isabella had given him of her honesty and firmness of mind. He admired her frankness and sincerity; but, on the other hand, his jealous temper inclined him to think, that, as she had an affection for Don Ra∣miro, it would not be long before she shook off the yoke of troublesome virtue, and that the first opportunity she would betray him. The affront he had lately put upon her increased his apprehen∣sion. We commonly judge of others hearts by our own. The wicked imagine that the most commendable actions are only artful cloaks for knavery.</P>
<P>Such tormenting thoughts were quickly suc∣ceeded by rage, and he resolved to be revenged the very first opportunity, both upon Isabella and Don Ramiro. He would have been glad to have gone that instant from Madrid, and to have carri-his spouse to one of his country seats, but his wounds hindered him from setting out as yet. He was therefore under the necessity of bearing all with patience.</P>
<P>While the Count thought of confining his wife in some solitary place, far from court, Don Ra∣miro
<PB N="29" REF="047415_0027_1023A11B06470E40"/>
being perfectly cured of his wounds, pre∣pared to quit not only Madrid but Spain, and to travel in foreign parts. He had no hopes of find∣ing any alleviation of his suffering, while he con∣tinued at Madrid. He thought absence would be his only relief. Love is excited and animated, more than any passion, by the nearness of its ob∣ject.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro was just upon setting out for France; but he could not resolve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o quit Spain, without acquainting Isabella of it. Isabella received his letter, and read it several times, but not with∣out shedding tears. The departure of her lover, is necessary as she thought it, overwhelmed her∣self with grief. She had been plunged a long time in these melancholy reflections, when word was brought her that her father was come. She went out of her chamber to receive him, and threw Don Ramiro's letter into a little box upon her toilet. Whether it was that she had not time to lock it, or whether she really forgot it, her husband coming soon after into her chamber, while she was in another room with her father, had the jealous curiosity to peep into this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox where he knew Isabella sometimes kept her pa∣pers. There he found Don Ramiro's letter, which he read and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid again in its place; but was in such a violent passion, that from that moment he formed a design to be the ruin of Don Ramiro, and to secure his wife in a close prison for her life. Nevertheless he resolved to take no notice till the moment he could work his revenge.</P>
<P>The wicked are more masters of their tempers than those who mean well. The sentiments of
<PB N="30" REF="047415_0028_1023A3925C3D4368"/>
the latter are painted on their faces; and in vain would they seek to dissemble; for their looks, their language, in short, every thing would betray them. True virtue can bear no mask of any shape whatsoever; but dissimulation is the art of the wick∣ed. The more heinous the crimes are which they in∣tend, the more art have they to conceal them.</P>
<P>The Count de St. Estevan had a soul so base, that he was sure of putting the revenge he had con∣trived into execution, without any possibility of preventing it. He proposed to his wife to re∣tire to one of his estates; Isabella who only de∣sired a solitary retirement from the world, and was the more earnest for it after she had heard of Don Ramiro's journey, readily consented to her husband's offer; and she even pressed him to set out with all speed.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Mendosa who thought differ∣ently from his daughter, was very sorry to find her going into the country. He only matched her to the Count de St. Estevan, thinking that the rank she would hold at court would make her instrumental to his ambition; but now all his hopes would be frustrated by being deprived of his daughter, and he should reap no advantage from having made her unhappy. He did what of lay in his power with the Count to hinder from leaving Madrid: but could obtain nothing him. He feared and not without reason, how passionate and jealous he would be, when he was at a distance from the court and could act with∣out any restraint. These mortifying ideas, which were but too well founded, determined the Mar∣quis to place a waiting maid with his daughter on
<PB N="31" REF="047415_0029_10239D344271F618"/>
whom he could depend, and who promised to in∣form him how Isabella fared, and how her hus∣band behaved to her.</P>
<P>The Count set out for his estate, continuing his dissimulation, and making no discovery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it could give Isabella the least suspicion of the hor∣rid designs which he was contriving, and putting into execution. This barbarian had posted assas∣sins in Don Ramiro's road, who, after having murdered him, were to bring him his heart: but Don Ramiro's good fortune preserved him from the snares that were laid for him. His valet-de-chambre happening to receive a wound by a fall from his horse, two leagues from the wood where the ruffians were posted. Don Ramiro did not care to stop, but ordered him to be put into his chaise, and carried gently to the next town: then he mounted his horse, taking only one footman with him, leaving the other to take care of the valet-de-chambre. The assassins, seeing two men pass by upon a gallop, thought they were Don Ramiro's domestics going to get post horses ready at the next stage. They were overjoyed to think, that the man whom they aimed at was deprived of that assistance which he might other∣wise have had, and lay concealed in that post. An hour after came Don Ramiro's chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which they presently knew to be the same the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were to attack. They fired at the postilion, and killed him; the lacky, who was on horseback, seeing him fall, turned about his horse, and rode back. The assassins, having him who was in the chaise at their mercy did not give him time so much as to speak, but shot him dead: After which they took
<PB N="32" REF="047415_0030_1023A2BB48CDA980"/>
his body, disfigured as it was with its blood, out of the chaise, opened the stomach, plucked out his heart and put it into a box▪ as for the body they interred in the middle of the wood, and far from the road, as they had been ordered, left, if it had been found with the heart taken out of it, a suspicion might have arisen that the murder had not been committed by common highwaymen.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro having waited a day for his valet-de-chambre, sent away messengers to learn what was become of him. Having met with the lacky, who as above-mentioned, rode off upon the at¦tack of the chaise, they brought him to Don Ra∣miro, and it was by his intelligence that he knew of the assassination of the postilion and valet de-chambre. He imagined that those who had com∣mitted the murder were highwaymen; and after having laid an account of what had happened be∣fore the Magistrates, he thought it his best way not to stay longer, his presence for prosecution for the murder being not necessary.</P>
<P>At the same time that Don Ramiro was travel∣ling to Paris, the ruffians who had assassinated his valet de-chambre steered their course towards the estate of the Count de St. Estevan, to whom they carried the heart, for which he was exceedingly impatient: for the murder of his rival was but a saint sketch of the horrid projects which he had formed; his raging jealousy having put him upon designs, attended with the more barbarity and cruelty than that of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>est monsters. There is no passion so dangerous as jealousy, in a wicked heart, for it prompts i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the greatest outrages.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="047415_0031_1023A2BCD51A30F0"/>
The Count's joy was beyond all measure, when he thought himself rid of his rival. All that vex∣ed him was, that the assassins had not told Don Ramiro, before they murdered him, that they did it by his order; for he thought his revenge was not compleat, because his enemy did not know who struck him. He reproached the assas∣sins for it more than once, and said they had per∣formed their commission by halves. As the other crimes. which he had contrived, were to be ex∣ecuted in his view, he resolved to take measures, that they might not be defective in the matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He sent for his cook, and calling him into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, "<HI>I</HI> am to let thee into a secret, said he, on which depends thy fortune, or thy death. Do not think thou can'st escape my wrath; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> refuse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to obey me, expect not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another day. The furious air, and wild looks of the Count made the poor cook tremble, and his fright and suspicious were greatly increased, when he heard that he was to dress the heart of a man, in the ragoo fashion, for Isabella. He made no doubt but this heart was poisoned; and though he was in the utmost fear, he fell on his knees at his master's feet, and with a promise that he would never speak of what had passed, begged that he would not make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of him to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of so much honour as Isabella. "Who bids <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Count abruptly, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for her death. I should not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pleasure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for I would fain re∣turn
<PB N="34" REF="047415_0032_1023A2BFC700F418"/>
to the false creature all the evils and all the vexation she has brought upon me."</P>
<P>The cook having had time to reflect on what the Count had said, believed that the heart was not poisoned. He immediately formed a design however, to prevent Isabella's tasting that horri∣ble ragoo that was designed for her; but made a shew of entering into the Count's views. "Since you will have it so, Sir, said he, I must obey you. Be assured that I shall keep it is an everlasting secret. Since you tell me there is no poisoning in the case, it is not my business to inquire into your designs" "I am satisfied, replied the Count, and will make thee a suitable reward."</P>
<P>As soon as the cook was gone out of his mas∣ters room, his first care was to throw the fatal flesh which he was charged to dress into the com∣mon shore, and fell to hall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the meat which he designed to serve up instead of the heart. When dinner-time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> apprehend the steward that such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to him, was that which his master had given him particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to prepare; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> told the count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and it to Isabella.

<PB N="35" REF="047415_0033_1023A2C14FAD32E8"/>
which substantial reasons have made me deter till now. I have been acquainted of your infidelity a great while, and have sure proofs of it."</P>
<P>Isabella was going to make answer to her hus∣band; but, without giving her time to speak, he said to her, "Whatever you shall offer in your justification will be to no purpose; I read, trea∣cherous woman, the last letter which your spark wrote to you on the day that he set out of town. He assures you that he will release you from me. He gives you hopes of my death." "Alas, cried Isabella; do not think that I have any concern in dictating the language which Don Ramiro's vex∣ation for having lost me may put into his mouth; my honour does not allow me to be suspected of such a crime; It is easy for me to vindicate myself from it. I fear not your reproaches nor your calumnies; but I dread suspicious that seem to have a foundation. So far was I from flattering Don Ramiro's passion, that I wished for his de∣parture; I was really glad that he was going so far out of my sight." "I have taken care, re∣plied the Count with some warmth to second your wishes, and the death, which I have caused him to be put to, will forever save you the trou∣ble of putting him out to your sight." "What, said Isabella with a ruins and trembling voice, have you caused Don Ramiro to be murdered?" "Yes, traitor, replied the Count, I have reveng∣ed the wrong done to me. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how it operates upon you. and am very sensible how deeply it afflicts you. This it was what I wished, and what Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to my revenge." "Barbarous wretch! cried Isabella, what more can'st thou ex∣pect

to fill up the measure of thy iniquity? Come, let me accompany Don Ramiro; put me also to death: Why dost thou make a stop in the midst of thy career? Deliver me from thy presence which I cannot bear, and restore me the happi∣ness which thou hast taken from me." "Yes, yes, said the Count in a fury, I will restore that happiness to you which you so earnestly desire, and have already done it, before you wished it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was willing to do all in my power to join you with your lover; I thought it convenient that you yourself should serve as a tomb for his ashes. Re∣member the dish that I recommended to you at table; it was his heart that I had ordered to be cooked up so"</P>
<P>There are certain situations wherein one would think the soul could not be quite over a helmed with great; yet it is then in the utmost ferment worked up by horror and despair, which give it a force that otherwise it would not have. The horrid secret which the Count had revealed to Isabella instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her. "Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to astonish me by telling me of this new crime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but what is like thee.

"No, it is not lost, said the Count, drawing his sword, and, as it is in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to take away thy life, I have one way still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> punishing thee" "Strike, replied Isa∣bella strike; thou are well versed in the art of assassination.</P>
<P>T'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> last insult made the Count quite raving mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he ran his sword at Isabella, by which he pricked her in the arm, and was going to re∣peat his thrust, when the waiting woman, whom the Marquis de Mendosa had appointed for his daughter, entering the room; and, rushing upon the Count, called out with horrid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ricks for help. Several of the servants came, and seeing Isabella all over bloody, and hunted away in an arm chair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> another appartment, and left the Count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that he seemed to be all in a fury, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had soft the use of his rea∣son. As soon as he began to come to himself, he went to Isabella's chamber door, but the same woman who came into seasonably to face the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one▪ with the assistance of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their master for this action, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> entrance.</P>
<P>By the care that was taken of Isabella, she can't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>: and though she had re∣covered her spirits, death and confusion were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on her countenance.

deserve the distress which! suffer!" She then turned to her waiting woman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was crying by her side, and acquainted her of all her hus∣band's guilt. "Your husband's blood, said the waiting woman, must be shed to atone for the assassination of your lover. Those crimes of his, which make nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dder, must be discovered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> magistrates. Leave it to me to work your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. "No, replied Isabella, let us conceal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> everlasting silence the crimes which the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that <HI>I</HI> should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>other in silence. I am going to retire to a convent, where I shall be at liberty to lament the death of Don Ramiro, and to cherish his memory. I charge you not to let any one know the misfortunes which I have suffered; became the discovery of them would only serve to renew them." The waiting wo∣man promised her mistress to satisfy her in every thing that the requested; but<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwithstanding her promise, sent private information to the Marquis de Mendosa of his daughter's wound, of Don Ramiro's being assassinated, and of the cruel ragoo. The Marquis, at the receipt of this intelligence, was extremely afflicted: Yet state policy which influenced all his actions, was his guide also upon this occasion. He was sensible that by revealing the Count de St. Estevan's crimes, which were hitherto known only to him∣self and Isabella's waiting woman, he should stain his own character. The ignomenious death of his son in law would be a disgrace to him and all his family; therefore he resolved to complain only of what was already public. He acquainted the King of the wound his daughter had received,
<PB N="39" REF="047415_0037_1023A2CD7A19B7E0"/>
and of her husband's rage; and, like a crafty Courtier, took this occasion to magnify the sub∣mission he had paid to the orders of his sovereign, and improving those sufferings which seemed the most cruel, to pave the way of his preferment. The King was affected by Isabella's misfortunes, permit∣ted her father to send for her back to Madrid, and dispatched an order that she might be brought thither by twenty dragoons, who were sent to fetch her from the country.</P>
<P>While these things passed at Madrid, the Count de St. Estevan was actually set out for Lisbon. He did not imagine that Isabella was so generous as to conceal the assassination of Don Ramiro; and therefore ordered three of his servants, of whom the cook was one, to be ready to let forward in the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of the evening.</P>
<P>Isabella continued three or four days longer in such a low state of spirits as hindered her from be∣ing sensible of all her misfortunes. In proportion as the began to recover her spirits, and to give more hopes of life, her sorrows gathered strength: The death of Don Ramiro appeared fresher in her imagination. She resolved, however, to bear up against her sorrow, though she could not conquer it: And, when the guard above mention∣ed was come for her she was in a condition to en∣dure the fatigue at of the journey. She would have been glad to have been excused going to Madrid; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he wrote on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to her father, and made use of the dragoons that were sent, to con∣duct her to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very far from that capital, and which was in the kingdom of Valen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> on the frontier of Catatonia, where she resolved to pass
<PB N="40" REF="047415_0038_1023A2D3BA7EBF28"/>
the rest of her days. When she was arrived there, she acquainted her father of her resolution, and begged him not to oppose it, because she was firmly resolved to quit the world forever.</P>
<P>While Isabella was edifying all the Nuns by her behaviour, Don Ramiro heard at Paris that his mistress was retired to a Convent, as well as how she came to be separated from her husband. On the other hand, the Count de St. Estevan, hav∣ing made it his business to enquire what was the talk at Madrid about Don Ramiro, discovered that he was not dead. The Marquis de Mendo∣sa was also undeceived; and, several persons hav∣ing received letters from Don Ramiro at Paris, giving an account of the assassination of his valet-de-chambre, the Marquis de Mendosa was let in∣to the real truth of this affair. He res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved to set out himself to convince his daughter how she had been imposed on, and to tell her news which he was sure must be very grateful to her. While he was preparing to set out, two other persons steer∣ed the same course, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Don Ramiro and the Count de St. Estevan. Don Ramiro let out from Paris three days after he came to it; for, as soon as he was informed of Isabella's retreat to a Con∣vent, he thought fit to hasten thither, in order to defend her against the attacks of her tyrant. On the other hand, the Count, being no longer apprehensive of any prosecution for the assassina∣tion of Don Ramiro, quitted Lisbon, and set out for the abbey to which he was informed his wife had retired. His design was either to poison or stab her; for his rage and jealousy were doubled after he saw Isabella out of his power.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="047415_0039_1023A2D6CBA56260"/>
Don Ramiro came first to the place which Isa∣bella had chosen for her retreat. Alighting from his chaise, he hastened to the Abbey, an gave notice that he was come to communicate some things of the last importance to the Countess de St. Estevan. The Nuns gave Don Ramiro ad∣mission into the hall without the convent. Isa∣bella came thither some moments after Don Ra∣miro. As soon as she perceived him, she gave a terrible shriek, and fell into a swoon with the fright. Don Ramiro, not knowing the reason of Isabella's fainting away, and ascribing it pure∣ly to her affection, approached her, and taking her by the hand, said to her, with a voice which was broken with tears and sighs: "If I had thought, Madam, that my unexpected presence would have brought the tragical ideas of your misfortunes so fresh to your remembrance, I would have been more cautions how I made my first appearance to you." Isabella made no an∣swer but fixed her eyes on Don Ramiro; and not withstanding the fright she was in, and her prepossession that she saw and heard a ghost, the image of her lover engaged all her attention. She durst not answer, but she heard and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: The force of her love, however, diminished that of her fear.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, being surprised to find Isabella so astonished, and discovering something in her countenance which betrayed fear, said to her, looking tenderly on her at the same time: "What, fair Isabella, has time changed your
<PB N="43" REF="047415_0040_1023A2D853746090"/>
heart? Am I hateful or indifferent to you? What is become of that love which you was to have re∣tained for me, even beyond the grave? Ah! how different has my heart been form your's! nothing has been capable of changing my sentiments. They are still the same. They are as tender as ever."</P>
<P>Fear is like the other passions: the second im∣pressions of it are not so violent as the first; and a very little space of time wears off the force of it. Isabella ventured to look upon her lover's image. She afterwards heard him, and had the courage even to attempt to answer him; for, at the first effort she made to speak, her tongue faltered two or three times, but at last it formed distinct founds. "Oh! Don Ramiro, said she, is it pos∣sible for you to love me so well as to return from the other world to give me proofs of it! Since the dead know the state of the living, you cannot be ignorant of the tears which I have shed for the loss of you, and the tenderness with which I have ever remembered you. Notwithstanding the fright which you have put me in, I consider this moment that I now see you again as the hap∣piest of all my life."</P>
<P>No words could express Don Ramiro's aston∣ishment. He knew not what to think of Isabel∣la's discourse. He was almost inclined to think that her senses were impaired. "I am not dead, re∣plied he, fair Isabella; I live, and live only to adore you." Isabella surprised at Don Ramiro's lan∣guage. "You are really alive then, said she, looking tenderly on him, and my cruel husband
<PB N="43" REF="047415_0041_1023A2D9DBF04090"/>
has not committed all the foul crimes which he related to me with as much assurance as cruelty. Oh! dear Ramiro! how many tears have you cost me, and how do I delight to see you again? You would guess how great my joy must be, if you could but know the measure of my past sor∣row." She then gave him an account of her husband's barbarity. Don Ramiro quickly per∣ceived that his life was only owing to the mistake of those ruffians who had murdered his valet de chambre, and so great was his rage against the Count de St. Estevan, that he resolved to go to Lisbon and fight a duel with him: nor was he e∣ven master enough of his temper to conceal his purpose from Isabella. No, said Isabella, if you have any love for me, I forbid you to fight a duel with my husband. If I am really dear to you, of which I make no manner of doubt, do not give me reason to complain of you. Do not stain my honour by a combat, wherein it will be thought that I was concerned. The tears which dropt from Isabella's eyes, while she was speaking to Don Ramiro, melted him. The fury which worked in his soul with such violence was succeed∣ed by a warm tenderness. When he came to himself, he was afraid to add to the sorrows of his dear mistress, and feigned a compliance with every thing she desired. There are certain cau∣ses, such as was this of Don Ramiro, wherein dissimulation becomes necessary to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over and tho' it appears so opposite to true love, it then is a necessary consequence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Isabella being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by promises which Don Ramiro did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="44" REF="047415_0042_1023A2DF8B792A10"/>
to keep, said to him, "I must also desire another favor of you; which is that you will set out from this abbey with all the speed you can, as your presence cannot but be injurious to my re∣putation. Farewell, dear Ramiro, it is time that I take myself from you. I think my afflictions infinitely the lighter, since you are alive. At these words Isabella, with tears in her eyes, went out of the parlour. Don Ramiro had not strength to make answer, but he followed her to the gate, took her by the hand, watered it with tears as he kissed it, and, when he was alone, stepped some moments longer, quite oppressed with grief, and without seeming to remember the purpose he had contrived. But his desire of punishing the Count de St. Estevan, quickly raged in him with more violence than before. He was no sooner returned to his quarters, but he ordered his ser∣vants to get the horses ready, and set out for Lisbon. He had already travelled six post miles, when he heard the firing of pistols, at the en∣trance of a wood not far off, through which the great road led. He thought he heard the cry of persons attacked, and pushed on to the place from whence the noise came. He presently discovered three persons stoutly dese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding themselves against six others, who surrounded and pressed on them from every side. Don Ramiro thought himself obliged to assist persons that were attacked with such odds, and alighted therefore from his chaise. He was very well seconded by his two domestics; so that one of the highwaymen fell immediately by the point of his sword, run in at his stomach,
<PB N="45" REF="047415_0043_1023A2E253199A48"/>
another died soon after of the wounds he had re∣ceived; and the other four seeing the fate of their comrades, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</P>
<P>In the heat of the skirmish, Don Ramiro took no observation of the physiog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of the persons whom he had assisted. How great therefore was his surprise, when, drawing near to the person who seemed to be the master of the others, and who was so dangerously wounded that he could not stand, but was forced to lean against a tree, he found it was the Count de St. Estevan. His astonishment was so great that he stared at him without saying one word: The languishing condi∣tion he found him in suspended his animosity.—The Count perceiving on his part that his pro∣tector was Don Ramiro, seemed almost as much surprised as he, and much more confounded.—Though he perceived he had not many minutes to live, his jealousy revived; so that he could not dispossess himself of a notion that his rival had been to see Isabella; and he was positive in his mind that she only retired to the abbey, that she might have the more freedom to converse with him. Rage and fury intirely engrossed his soul and he was resolved to fill up the measure of all his iniquities; but he dissembled, and concealed his wrath to render the effects of it the more fatal. "I perceive, said he to Don Ramiro, that it was the will of Heaven that I should be reconciled to you before I died, and that I should with my own hand restore a felicity to you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which I unjustly robbed you. The obligation I have to you, though it proves unsuccessful, ought
<PB N="46" REF="047415_0044_1023A2E3DB20E688"/>
nevertheless to engage me to gratitude. I have not many more moments to live; permit me to make you the bearer of my last will to Isabella. I have a right to require it of her; I wish that she would give herself to you in marriage. My servants will tell her, and her father too, of the service you have done me: They will be witnesses that I die in friendship with you. I desire you to forget what is past: I resign my breath; be so good as to let me die in your arms, that I may expire with the satisfaction, at least, of being persuaded that you have pardoned me." Don Ramiro, seeing his enemy giving up the ghost, and touched with a remorse for the misfortunes he had brought upon Isabella, was so generous as to forget the injuries he had done to himself. I forgive you every thing, said he to the Count, embracing him at the same time, and my heart is not"—Don Ramiro said no more, but cried out; for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Count, embracing him, stab∣bed him with a dagger which he drew that instant out of his pocket. Don Ramiro, engaged at his enemy's trencher, wrested the dagger out of his hand; and just as he was going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it into his heart▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Count fell to the ground, and died; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him from being the murderer of a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Don Ramiro's servants and those two of the Count de St. Estevan, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their master for his curse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> villainy, took care a∣like of Don Ramiro. They stopped the blood which issued from his wound, and fetching a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itter from the next village, carried him in it, covered
<PB N="47" REF="047415_0045_1023A2E575703CA0"/>
up, to the nearest town, which was that wherein the abbey was situate. As soon as Don Ramiro was come thither, he sent one of the Count's servants to acquaint Isabella of the sad affair that had happened. Such was her abhorrence of the Count's action, that she could not lament his death; but so great was her affliction to hear that Don Ramiro was dangerously wounded, that she could not help going to see him. She was just departing out of the Convent, when she was in∣formed that her father the Marquis de Mendosa was arrived, and waited in the parlour to speak with her. She ran to embrace him, and having acquainted him of her husband's death, and of Don Ramiro's wound, the Marquis chose to lead her himself to the man whom he commanded her to regard from that moment as her future spouse.</P>
<P>The surgeons had just laid on the first dressing of Don Ramiro's wound, when Isabella and her fa∣ther came to him. He seemed so overjoyed at this favour, that he forgot the evils he had suf∣fered. The hopes of being soon perfectly happy by the possession of Isabella, which the Marquis assured him of, contributed as much as the care of his doctors to his cure, which was compleated in a very little time, as was his marriage with his fair mistress.</P>
