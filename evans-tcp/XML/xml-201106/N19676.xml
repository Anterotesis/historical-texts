<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a country where music has not yet become a regular profession, it cannot be expected that a composition of this kind can stand a rigid criticism; but as every attempt to subserve the interest, or to encrease the innocent pleasures of the community, deserves public patronage, the author of the following work, without further apology, presents it to the public eye.</P>
<P>He has aimed at originality in his compositions, and endeavoured to deviate (as far as he deemed it justifiable) from the common style; where he has given into it, he has attempted to improve it by a particular attention to the harmony.</P>
<P>Those who have encouraged the work by subscription, are respectfully thanked, and are assured that the ut∣most pains have been taken to render the work correct; such errors as escaped observation in the execution of it, are noticed in the errata.</P>
<P>The author sincerely wishes that the purchasers of the work may derive sufficient advantage from it, to com∣pensate them for their expenses; but should the reverse be true, he will as sincerely lament that he and his friends have mistaken his abilities.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION to the ART of SINGING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>Of MUSIC in GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>"MUSIC consists in a succession of pleasing sounds;"—As a <HI>Science,</HI> it demonstrates and explains their true relation and just disposition;—as an <HI>Art,</HI> it teaches their proper expression.</P>
<P>All musick is comprehended in <HI>melody</HI> and <HI>harmony.</HI> Melody is a single succession of founds; or, in other words, is the air of a piece of music. Harmony is the combination of several sounds at the same time. Modula∣tion is the just arrangement of the sounds both of the Melody and Harmony.</P>
<P>The primary and most essential qualities of musical sounds are, <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Tune;</HI> upon a due attention to these distinctions, and their judicious management, depends all the pleasing and infinite variety of the musical art.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="gamut">
<HEAD>Of the GAMUT, or SCALE of MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>There are but seven distinct degrees of sound in the scale; five of which are called whole, and two are called half, or semi-tones. Every eighth from any given sound will be the same, and the degrees of ascent or descent from it, will be in effect a repetition of the former sounds. These seven sounds are represented on lines and spaces by the seven first letters of the alphabet; their places on them are as follow:

THE scale is divided into three parts; each part, consisting of five lines, with their spaces, and distinguished with a cliff, is called a stave.</P>
<P>The first division is called the Bass stave; its cliff is thus marked {F-clef} and is called the F cliff—it is always placed on the fourth line from the bottom.</P>
<P>The second division of the scale is called the Counter stave;—its cliff is thus marked {C-clef} and is called the C cliff. It is commonly placed on the middle line of the stave. This cliff, however, is moveable, and may be placed on either of the five lines or spaces; that line or space which passes between the two transverse strokes, will be C, and all the other letters of the scale will be in regular succession above and below it.</P>
<P>The third and last division of the scale is called the Treble or Tenor stave; its cliff is marked thus {G-clef} and is called the G cliff; its place is invariably on the second line from the bottom.</P>
<P>There are but four names of notes representing sounds, viz. Mi, Fa, Sol, La: of which <HI>Mi</HI> is the principal, and governs all the rest; and when <HI>Mi</HI> is found, the order of the notes above it will be Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La; and below Mi, La, Sol, Fa, and then <HI>Mi</HI> recurs, either way.</P>
<P>It has been before observed, that of the seven degrees of sound in the scale, two are semi-tones; their natural places are between B and C, and E and F. Their situation, however, is often varied by flats and sharps, which transpose Mi from B, its natural place; in all which cases the semitones will be between Mi and Fa, and La and Fa, as in the natural scale.</P>

<ITEM>These figures are used only when some part of the music is to be repeated; the note under figure 1 is to be performed the first time; the second time, it is omitted, and the note or notes under figure 2 performed; sometimes they are connected by a slur, and then they are both performed.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Of TIME, and its various MARKS or MODES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are three kinds of time made use of in Music, viz. Common Time, Treble Time, and Compound Time.</P>
<P>Common Time is divided into four modes. The first mode is called Adagio, and is thus marked <!-- {timeimperf-prolatimperf} --> {common time (adagio)} This mode contains one semibreve, or the value thereof in other notes or rests in each bar:—The bar is usu∣ally performed in the time of four seconds.</P>
<P>The second mode of common time is called Largo, and thus marked <!-- {timeimperf-prolatimperf-str} --> {common time (largro)} It contains the same quantity of notes in the bar as the foregoing, but is performed a quarter faster.</P>
<P>The third mode of common time is called Allegro, and thus marked <!-- {timeimperf-prolatimperf-rev-str} --> {common time (allegro)} This also contains the same notes in a bar as the first mode, but the bar is performed in the time of two seconds.</P>
<P>The fourth mode of common time is marked 2/4 and contains the amount of one minim in the bar:—it is per∣formed about one quarter faster than the Allegro mode.</P>
<P>Treble time is divided into three modes. The first mode is marked thus 3/2 and contains three minims in a bar, or other notes and rests to that amount. The bar is performed in the time of three sconds.</P>
<P>The second mode of treble time is marked thus 3/4 and contains three crotchets or their value in each bar, and is performed about a quarter faster.</P>
<P>The third mode of treble time is thus marked 3/8 and contains the value of three quavers in a bar: This mode is performed about a quarter faster than the second.</P>
<P>There are many modes of compound time, two of which only shall be noticed here.</P>
<P>The first mode is thus marked 6/4 and contains the value of six crotchets in a bar. The bar is performed in the time of two seconds.</P>
<P>The second mode is thus marked 6/8 and contains the amount of six quavers in a bar. It is performed one quar∣ter fafter than the first mode.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="025695_0011_0FCEC06E52CFF6B8"/>
It may not be unserviceable to observe in this place, that the first mode of common time is the standard with which all other modes are compared, and by which they are regulated. All modes which are marked with figures have a primary reference to this mode, and are derived from it;—thus, the mark 2/4 denotes that the bar must con∣tain two fourths of a bar in the first mode of common time, or (which is the same thing) of a semibreve; and all other figures distinguishing different modes may be considered as fractions of a semibreve; the under figure ex∣pressing how many parts the semibreve must be divided into, and the upper figure shewing how many of those parts are contained in a bar.</P>
<P>When the modes above explained are thoroughly understood, a proper attention to the foregoing remarks will enable any one to acquire an idea of all other modes marked with figures, without any further illustration.</P>

<HEAD>Of BEATING TIME.</HEAD>
<P>BEATING time is an artificial way of measuting the proportionate duration of the notes; the common methods of doing which, are as follow, yiz. For the two first modes of common time, which have four beats in a bar, 1st, let the ends of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, raise the heel of the hand; 4th, throw up the ends of the fingers, and the bar will be finished.</P>
<P>For the third and fourth modes of common time, and for the 6/4 and 6/8 modes of compound time, which have only two beats in a bar, 1st, let the hand fall; 2d, raise it, and the bar will be completed.</P>
<P>For treble time, all the modes of which have three beats in a bar, 1st, let the ends of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, throw up the ends of the fingers, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of SYNCOPATION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTES of Syncopation are such as have their sound continued through bars, or are placed out of their natural order in them; very difficult examples of such notes may be framed, but when words are applied to them, they in∣duce a forced and vicious pronunciation, and never occur in good vocal music; the common instances are by no means difficult to be executed, and do not merit a particular explanation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of ACCENT.</HEAD>
<P>ACCENT is a certain modulation or warbling of the sounds, in order to express the passions naturally with the voice.</P>
<P>Accented parts of the bar are, for common time, the first and third parts; for treble time, the first part only; for compound time, the first and fourth parts of the bar; and emphatical words should be set to those parts; but it will often happen, that such words will occur in other parts, and the accented parts have words of no emphasis; in which cases, every one must feel the propriety of the music's bending to the words, and that the general rule for accenting must be neglected; and from hence, may be inferred, that the doctrine of accent is designed more for the use of the composer, than of the performer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the KEYS of MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but two keys in music, viz. 1st, the major or sharp key, and 2d. the minor or flat key. The first of these is adapted to express the cheerful passions, and the latter is expressive of the solemn, the mournful and the pathetic.</P>
<P>The key note is that sound upon which a tune may be said to be built:—It is the predominant tone, to which all others have a particular reference; it is commonly the concluding note of the tenor, and always that of the bass,
<PB N="xiii" REF="025695_0013_0FCEC071C0DE4270"/>In reckoning from the key note, if the semitones in the octave be between the third and the fourth, and between the seventh and the eighth, the tune is in the major or sharp key; if they lie between the second and third, and between the fifth and sixth, it is in the minor or flat key.</P>
<P>In the natural scale the key note of the major key, will be C; of the minor it will be A.</P>
<P><LABEL>EXAMPLES.</LABEL></P>
<P>C, Major Key. <GAP DESC="music" DISP="〈♫〉"/>
The regular places for the half tones are between B and C, and E and F, an examination of the octave as laid down above, shews that they lie between the third and fourth, and between the seventh and eighth, consequently it is in the sharp key, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A, Minor Key. <GAP DESC="music" DISP="〈♫〉"/> An examination of this octave shews that the semitones are between the second and third, and between the fifth and sixth, of course it is the flat key, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No tune can be regularly composed on any other letter besides C and A, without the assistance of flats or sharps; but, by a proper placing of them on the lines and spaces, every semitone contained in the octave may be made the foundation or key note of a tune: For in stance, if the letter C be taken for the key note of a tune in the major key, one of the semitones will be between the sixth and seventh, whereas it should be between the seventh and eighth; now, by placing a sharp on F, the sound of all the notes on that letter will be a semitone higher than in the natural scale, and consequently leave but half a tone between the seventh and eighth from G; by which mean, G then be∣comes regularly the key note for a tune in the sharp key.</P>
<P>It would be no difficult task to extend this explanation through all the semitones contained in the octave, but perhaps it may be sufficient for learners to be taught to distinguish the keys, in the first place, by the following rule, viz. if the key note be the <HI>Fa</HI> immediately above Mi, a third from it will be a major third, and the music will be in the sharp key; but if the key note be the <HI>La</HI> immediately under Mi, a third from it will be a minor third, and the tune will be in the fiat key.</P>
<P>N. B. A. major third contains two whole, or four semitones. A minor third contains but three semitones.</P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This lesson also should be well understood before tunes in the minor key are attempted.

<PB N="xv" REF="025695_0015_0FCEC07ACDC65E00"/>
<HEAD>PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following work, when tunes have but three parts, the treble is placed between the tenor and the bass; when they have four parts, the tenor is placed next to the bass, the counter next to the tenor, and the treble next to the counter.</P>
<P>Flats, sharps, and naturals, are not considered as having influence (excepting at the beginning of tunes or strains) upon any note but that immediately succeeding.</P>
<P>The pitch of all the parts should be taken from the key note.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY person should sing that part to which his voice is best adapted; to determine which, learners should submit to the judgment of their teacher.</P>
<P>The tone of the bass should be full and majestic; of the tenor, bold and manly; of the counter, soft yet firm; of the treble, smooth and delicate.</P>
<P>High notes in every part should, in general, be sung softer than the low.</P>
<P>In a company of fingers it would have a good effect for some of the performers on each part to be silent when passages marked <HI>piano,</HI> occur; the additional strength of their voices in the <HI>forte,</HI> which generally precedes or suc∣ceeds the <HI>piano,</HI> would mark the contrast more distinctly, and give peculiar force and energy to the performance.</P>
<P>The various inflections of voice and tone, which render one <HI>air</HI> more expressive of one passion than another, can∣not be taught by certain and infallible rules; a performer should endeavour to form a proper idea of the author's design in a piece of music, and his own judgment and taste must be his principal directors in doing justice to it.</P>
<P>A good and graceful manner of singing is best acquired by <HI>imitoetion.</HI> A teacher cannot by precept alone in∣struct his pupils in the art of modulating different airs to express different passions; but by example he can.</P>
<P>Every note of every part of an excellent piece of music may be founded, strictly speaking, right, and the compo∣sition, nevertheless, appear dull and trifling. It is the expressive manner—the realizing the passion—and giving particular emphasis to those words which contain the force of the sentiment, which give rise to the inexpressible de∣light derived from hearing good musical performances.</P>
<P>The voice, the looks, the gestures of the performers, are severally necessary to give music its full energy, and are respectively the sources of pleasure or disgust to the observing hearer.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="025695_0016_0FCEC07D08973418"/>
Besides the artificial graces of music, such as trills, appoggiatura, &amp;c. there are innumerable others which never have been, nor ever can be, defined; but must be learned (as was hinted before) by imitation, or suggested by a dis∣cerning judgment.</P>
<P>Few graces, however, if any, are admissible in full chorusses, unless they are expressed in the composition; in strains of two or three parts, they may be frequently introduced; but solos are the proper field for their full display.</P>
<P>A vulgar, inarticulate pronunciation—a heavy, lifeless manner—sudden and unmeaning explosions of sound, are totally inconsistent with good singing; on the other hand, a clear and spirited tone—a just and accurate pro∣nunciation—and occasional swells upon the notes, judiciously introduced, are distinguishing characteristics of an ele∣gant performer.</P>
<P>In good music, as well as in good poetry, or in any other species of good writing, there are different styles; some of which, though they may not, at first hearing, command a very favourable opinion, upon being often performed, and rendered familiar, will please more, and longer, than others which were thought superior; hence, the impropriety and injustice of hastily rejecting, as worthless and insignificant, such music as may be composed out of the common style.</P>
<P>In composition, it is an essential point to adapt the tune to the subject of the song. Subjects of penitence, pray∣er, sorrow, &amp;c. require tunes in the minor key; and those of cheerfulness, joy, thanksgiving; &amp;c. the major key; but this rule is often violated; and with the most unhappy and ridiculous effect. Can that joy, or praise, or thanksgiving be thought sincere, the expression of which is accompanied with sighs, and groans, and tears? Can <HI>his</HI> sorrow or distress appear otherwise than farcical, whose relation of it is interrupted by sallies of pleasantry, and peals of laughter? If this be not an unjust representation of the effect of disregarding the foregoing rule, (and it is presumed it is not) it must be considered not only a transgression against all musical propriety, but an outrageous affront to common sense.</P>
<P>In churches and congregations this rule demands a still more particular attention; for an injudicious application of tunes to the psalms or hymns, will make the performance appear a profane burlesque upon a very important duty.</P>
<P>A decent and regular demeanor in a band of singers, adds much to the pleasure arising from their performances; in worshipping societies, a contrary behaviour is altogether inexcusable, and well deserves the censure of every so∣ber mind; for it argues a total insensibility to those solemn impressions, which every one should feel when in the more immediate presence of the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> and employed in one of the highest acts of his worship.</P>
