<PB REF="031147_0003_0FEAE289717A4A50"/>
<HEAD>TO ALL FREE-MASONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following pages has the ho∣nour of being well respected in most of the Lodges of reputation in this metropolis, and has been a frequent visitor at the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard; the Globe, in Fleet-street; the Jeru∣salem, at Clerkenwell; Half-moon, Cheapside; Crown and Anchor, in the Strand; Salutation, Grey-Friars; and several others of less note.</P>
<P>An earnest desire of becoming a perfect master of MASONRY, and the success he met with in his first attempt, has rendered him capable of revealing those mysteries to the world, which, till now, have been kept secret as the grave.</P>
<P>He acquired his knowledge at first from some loose papers belonging to a merchant to whom he was nearly related, who had been a member of the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard. This rela∣tion dying about ten years ago, the Editor became possessed of his effects; and on looking over his papers, among others he found some memorandums or remarks on MASONRY, which excited his curiosity so far, that he resolved on accomplishing his scheme, without going through the ceremonies required by the society.</P>
<P>The remarks of his friend above-mentioned fur∣nished hints sufficient to make a trial on an intimate acquaintance, a FREE MASON, who readily gave him the Sign in the manner he expected. After a more narrow inspection on the part of his friend, such as, where he was made, and when, &amp;c. &amp;c. (to all
<PB REF="031147_0004_0FEAE28AF6980B30"/>which he answered with great readiness) he received an invitation to spend an evening at a tavern in the Strand, with several acquaintances. Elated by this success, he boldly advanced with his company; all of whom belonged to the Lodge, and were well known by the TYLER at the door. After the usual ceremony, in which he gave full satisfaction, he was admitted and took his seat. That night he saw two MAKINGS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MAKING, the term used in the circular letters to the members of the Ledge, acquainting them that new members are to be admitted the next Ledge night.</NOTE>, and came off full of spirits.</P>
<P>Soon after he went to another Lodge, where he distinguished himself greatly in answering the ques∣tions proposed by the Master, which he acquired from his friend's manuscripts of the ENTERED AP∣PRENTICE, and FELLOW-CRAFT's Lectures.</P>
<P>His regard to the society, and respect to the pub∣lic, is the only inducement to this publication, which is intended not only to assist those who have been lately made, and still remain ignorant of the true foundation of the Art, but also to give all that have an inclination to become Masons an opportunity of considering the advantages and disadvantages of the engagements and oaths by which they are bound.— Such is the intention of this undertaking; and the Editor flatters himself the Brotherhood will not con∣demn his officiousness in this respect, as it will rather strengthen than hurt the interest of the society; the fear of going through the ceremony, which hitherto has been represented in such frightful shapes, being the greatest obstacle to its future welfare and increase.</P>
<P>The Editor's ambition is to please; and the work is submitted to the only proper judges, viz. his Bre∣thren the FREE MASONS; to whom he begs leave to declare, that no private or public quarrel, the view of gain, nor any other motive than the public good could ever have induced him to write upon this sub∣ject; and he declares to the world, that the following is the whole of true MASONRY in all its branches.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0005_0FEAE292FB7004C8"/>
SINCE the former edition of this pamphlet was put to press the author has received from his publisher several annony∣mous letters, containing the lowest abuse and scurrilous invec∣tives; nay, some have proceeded so far as to threaten his per∣son. He requests the favour of all enraged brethren, who shall chuse to display their talents for the future, that they will be so kind as to pay the postage of their letters, for there can be no reason why he should put up with their ill treatment, and pay the piper into the bargain. Surely there must be something in this book very extraordinary; a something they cannot digest, thus to excite the wrath and ire of those hot brained Mason-bit gentry! But however unwiling the Editor may be to publish <HI>all</HI> the letters and messages he has received on this occasion, yet he cannot be so deficient in returning the compliment, as to con∣ceal one, which notwithstanding the threatenings contained in it, appears to be wrote with very little meaning, and he has (sans ceremonie) ventured to publish it verbatim.</P>

These me∣dals are usually of silver, and some of them highly finished and ornamented, so as to be worth ten or twenty guineas. They are suspended round the neck with Ribbons of various colours, and worn on their public days of meeting, at funeral pro∣cessions, &amp;c. in honour of the Craft.

<P>The Candlesticks, &amp;c. in many Lodges are curiously wrought, the Chair in which the Grand Master sits, as well as those of the Masters of inferior Lodges, are richly carved with emble∣matical figures; their apions are bound with ribbons of various colours; and, in short, every thing belonging to them is finished in the most elegant teste.</P>

<HEAD>AN AUTHENTIC KEY TO THE DOOR OF FREE-MASONRY.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rife of this science (says a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> original record) was before the flood in the 4th chapter of Genesis it is said, there was a man named <HI>Lamech</HI> who had two wives named <HI>Adah</HI> and <HI>Zillah;</HI> by <HI>Adah</HI> he begat two sons. <HI>Jubal</HI> and <HI>Jubal:</HI> by <HI>Zillah</HI> be begat one son. called <HI>Tubal Cain,</HI> and a daughter named <HI>Naamah.</HI> These children found out the beginning of all the Crafts in the world; <HI>Jubal</HI> found out Geometry; he divided flocks of sheep, and built the first house of timber and stone. <HI>Jubal</HI> found out the art of Music, and was the father of all those who handled the harp. <HI>Tubal Cain</HI> was the instructor of all artificers in iron and brass; and his daughter discovered the Craft of Weaving.</NOTE> of the society called Free-Masons is said by some to have been a certain number of persons who formed a resolution to rebuild the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By an old record it appears, that king <HI>Solomon</HI> confirmed all the charges which king <HI>David</HI> had given to Masons in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and that the Temple was finished A. M. 3000. In the year 43. after <HI>Christ,</HI> Masons first came into <HI>England</HI> and built the Monastery of <HI>Glastonbury</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></NOTE>. This appears from the lecture, or rather history, of the Order, at the mak∣ing or raising of a member to the degree of Master, which is fully described in the following work. But I am inclined to
<PB REF="031147_0008_0FEAE29B1754F620"/>think that the chief design of the establishment is to rectify the heart, inform the mind, and promote the moral and social virtues of humanity, decency, and good order, as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible in the world: and some of the emblems of Free-Masons confirm this opinion, such as the Compass, Rule, Square, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In all countries where Masonry is practised, or established at this time, there is a Grand Master; but formerly there was only one Grand Master, and he was an <HI>Englishman.</HI> HIS ROYAL HICHNESS GEORCE PRINCE OF WALES is the person on whom the dignity is now bestowed, who governs all the Lodges in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and has the power of delivering the constitutions and laws of the society to the Masters who preside over the subordinate assemblies: which constitutions must always be signed by the Grand Secretary of the Order.—The Grand Master can hold a Meeting or Lodge when he thinks proper, which is generally the second <HI>Saturday</HI> in every month in the summer, but oftener in the winter.</P>
<P>The other Lodges meet regularly twice a month in the winter half-year, and once a month in the summer; and the members of each Lodge pay quarterly, from 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> to 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> into the hands of the Treasurer; and this generally defrays the expence of their meetings.</P>
<P>There are also quarterly communications or meetings, held, at which are present the Master and Wardens of every re∣gular constitution in and near <HI>London,</HI> where the several Lodges send, by the said Wardens, different sums of money to be paid into the hands of the Treasurer-General, and ap∣propriated to such charitable uses as the Grand Master, and the Masters of the different Lodges under him, think proper; but these charities are chiefly confined to Masons only. Such as have good recommendations as to their behaviour and cha∣racter, will be assisted with five, ten, or twenty pounds; and lefs sums are distributed to the indigent brethren, in pro∣portion to their wants, and the number of years they have been members. At these quarterly communications, large sums are likewise sent from Lodges in the most remote parts of the world, viz. in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies.</HI> and accounts transmitted of the growth of Masonry there. The state of the funds of the society are likewise communicated to the company, and the deliberations of the meeting taken down by the Secretary, who lays them before the Grand Master at the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>The number of members which compose a Lodge is inde∣terminate: but it is no Lodge except there are present one Master, three Fellow Crafts, and two Apprentices.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0009_0FEAE29E2BFA06B0"/>
When a Lodge is met, there are two principal officers un∣der the Master, called Senior and Junior Wardens, whose business it is to see the laws of the society strictly adhered to, and the word of command given by the Grand Master, regu∣larly followed.</P>
<P>It must be remarked, that the authority of a Master, though chief of the Lodge, reach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no farther than he is himself an observer of the laws; should he infringe them, the brethren never fail to censure him; and if this has no effect, they have a power of doposing him, and appealing to the Grand Master, and giving their reasons for it; but they seldom proceed to this extremity.</P>
<P>As no doubt the reader chuses to be made acquainted with every circumstance of the ceremony of making a Mason, I shall begin with the following directions, and proceed regularly in the description of what further concerns Masonry.</P>
<P>A man desirous of becoming a Free-Mason, should endea∣vour to get acquainted with a member of some good Lodge, who will propose him as a candidate for admission the next Lodge-night. The Brother who proposes a new member, is likewise obliged to inform the Brethren of the qualifications of the candidate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the good of this, and all other societies, it were to be wished a more strict regard was paid, on the part of the proposers, to the character and morals of every candidate.</NOTE>. Upon this it is debated whether or not he shall be admitted; and it being carried in the affirmative, the next step is to go with the proposer the ensuing Lodge-night.</P>
<P>The evening being come when a Lodge is to be held, which generally begins about seven in the winter, and nine in the summer, as previous notices are sent to the members for this purpose; the Masons are punctual to time, and it frequently happens, that, in half an hour, the whole Lodge, to the number of fifty or sixty, are assembled.</P>
<P>The Master, the two Assistants, Secretary, and Treasurer, begin with putting over their necks a blue ribbon of a trian∣gular shape; to the Master's ribbon hangs a Rule and Compass, which is in some Lodges made of gold, though in others only gilt: the Assistants, Senior Wardens, and the other officers, carry the Compass alone.</P>
<P>The candles are placed upon the table in the form of a triangle; and in the best Lodges the candlesticks are finely carved with emblematical figures. Every Brother has an apron made of white skin, and the strings are also of skin; though some of them chuse to ornament them with ribbons
<PB N="4" REF="031147_0010_0FEAE2A149606FB8"/>of various colours. On the grand days, such as quarterly communications, or general meetings, the grand officers aprons are finely decorated, and they carry the Rule and Compass, the emblems of the Order.</P>
<P>When they sit down to the table, the Master's place is on the east side, the bible being opened before him, with the Compass laid thereon, and the points of them covered with a lignum vitae or box Square; and the Senior and Junior Wardens opposite to him on the west and south. On the table is likewise wine, punch, &amp;c. to regale the Brethren, who take their places according to their seniority. Being thus seated, after a few minutes, the Master proceeds to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To open a Lodge,</HI> in Masonry, signifies that it is allowed to speak freely among one another of the mysteries of the Order</NOTE> <HI>open the Lodge</HI> in the following manner:</P>

<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Lodge is open, in the name of holy St. <HI>John,</HI> forbidding all oursing, swearing, or whispering, and all prophane discourse whatever, under no less penalty than what the majority shall think proper.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Master gives three knocks upon the table with a wooden hammer, and puts on his hat, the Brethren being uncovered; he then asks, if the gentleman proposed last Lodge-night is ready to be made? and on being answered in the affimative, he orders the Wardens to go out and pre∣pare the person, who is generally waiting in a room at some distance from the Lodge room by himself, being left there by his friend who proposed him. He is conducted into ano∣ther room, which is totally dark; and then asked, Whe∣ther he is conscious of having the vocation necessary to be received? On answering yes, he is asked his name, sur∣name, and profession. When he has answered these ques∣tions, whatever he has about him made of metal is taken away, as buckles, buttons, rings, &amp;c. and even the money in his pocket.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some Lodges they are so particular, that the candidate's clothes are taken off, if there be lace on them.</NOTE> Then they uncover his right knee, and put his left foot with his shoe on into a slipper;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is not practised in every Lodge; some only slipping the heel of the shoe down.</NOTE> hood∣wink him with a handkerchief, and leave him to his re∣flection
<PB N="6" REF="031147_0012_0FEAE87DA020D698"/>for about half an hour. The chamber is also guarded within and without by some of the Brethren who have drawn swords in their hands. The person who proposed the can∣didate stays in the room with him: but they are not permitted to converse together.</P>
<P>During this silence, and while the candidate is preparing, the Brethren in the Lodge are putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very thing in order for his reception there; such as drawing the annexed figure on the floor at the upper part of the room; which is ge∣nerally done with chalk and charcoal intermixed; though some Lodges use tape and little nails to form it; which prevents any mark or stain on the floor. It is drawn cast and west. The Master stands in the east, with the Square hanging at his breast, the holy bible opened at the gospel of St. <HI>John,</HI> and three lighted tapers are placed in the form of a triangle in the midst of the drawing on the floor.</P>
<P>The proposer then goes and knocks three times at the door of the grand apartment, in which the ceremony is to be performed.

When this part of the ceremony is ended, the Master, who stands at the upper end, facing the foot or steps of the drawing on the floor, behind a low arm-chair, asks the following question, Whether you have a desire to become a Mason? and if it is of your own free will and choice? Upon which the candidate answers, Yes. "Let him see the Light." says the Master: They then take the handkerchief from his eyes, and whilst they are so doing, the Brethren form a circle round him, with their swords drawn in their hands, the points of which are presented to his breast. The ornaments borne by the officers, the glittering of the swords, and fantastic appearance of the Brethren in white aprons, creates great surprise, especially to a person, who for above an hour has been fatigued with the bandage over his eyes; and his uncertainty concerning what is further to be done for his reception, must, no doubt, throw his mind into great perplexity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient Masons made use of a prayer inserted in the Apprentice's Lecture; but the moderns leave it out when they make a Brother.</NOTE></P>
<P>The candidate is then directed to advance three times to a stool at the foot of the arm-chair; he is taught to step in a proper manner by one of the assistants. Upon the stool are placed the rule and compass; and one of the Brethren says to the candidate to this effect: <Q>You are now entering into a respectable society, which is more serious and important than you imagine. It admits of nothing contrary to law, religion, or morality; nor does it allow any thing inconsistent with the allegiance due to his Majesty; the Worshipful Grand Master will inform you of the rest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is here to be understood, that in different Lodges this speech varies; as also do the forms of making, in some respects, which may be seen in the Entered Apprentice's Lecture; where the only proper and ancient method a clearly pounted out.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>As soon as the speaker has ended his speech, he is desired to put his right knee upon the stool, which is bare, as men∣tioned above<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The ancient custom was thus: The candidate, though kneeling on his right knee, should have his left foot in the air; but this position being fa∣tiguing, it is omitted in most Lodges.</NOTE>, and his left foot is put into a slipper, with the shoe on, or the shoe slipped at the heel, to represent a slipper.</P>
<P>The candidate being in this posture, the Worshipful Grand Master addresses him to the following effect: <Q>Do you promise never to tell, write, or disclose, in any man∣ner whatever, the secrets of Free Masonry and Free Ma∣sons,
<PB REF="031147_0015_0FEAE885D82BED60"/>except to a Brother at the Lodge, and in the presence of the Worshipful Grand Master?</Q> On which the person says, "I do." His waistcoat is then unbuttoned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is done left a woman should offer herself. If we believe the <HI>Irish.</HI> there is a lady at this time in Ireland, who has gone through the whole cere∣mony, and is as good a Mason as any of them.</NOTE>, and the point of a pair of compasses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ancients used a sword or spear instead of a compass.</NOTE> placed upon his naked left breast, and he himself holds it with his left hand, his right being laid upon the gospel opened at St. <HI>John;</HI> when the following oath is administered to him, he repeating it after the Master:</P>

<P>I—A.B. of my own free will and accord, and in the presence of Almighty God<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The form of the oath differs in many Lodges, though this is the strictest in use; and in some societies instead of saying, <Q>In the presence of Al∣mighty mighty God,</Q> it runs thus, <Q>I promise before the Grant Architect of the Universe,</Q> &amp;c.</NOTE>, and this Right Worship∣ful Lodge, dedicated to St. <HI>John,</HI> do hereby, and herein most solemnly and sincerely swear, that I will always hale, conceal, and never reveal any of tho secrets or mysteries of Free-Masonry, that shall be delivered to me now, or at any time hereafter, except it be to a true and lawful Brother, or in a just and lawful Lodge of Brothers and Fellows, him or them whom I shall find to be such, after just trial and due examination. I furthermore do swear that I will not write it, print it, cut it, paint it, stint it, mark it, stain or engrave it, or cause it so to be done, upon any thing moveable or immoveable under the canopy of heaven, whereby it may become legible or in∣telligible, or the least appearance of the character of a let∣ter, whereby the secret art may be unlawfully obtained. All this I swear, with a strong and steady resolution to perform the same, without any hesitation, mental reser∣vation, or self-evasion of mind in me whatsoever; under no less penalty than to have my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the root, and that it be buried in the sands of the sea, at low water mark, a cable's length from the shore, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours.

<P>The new made member is then taught the Sign, Grip, and Pass-word of the Entered Apprentice, which will be
<PB REF="031147_0016_0FEAE888AD9C8380"/>seen more clearly in the following lecture belonging to that part of Masonry.</P>
<P>He is also learnt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> step, or how to advance to the Master upon the drawing on the floor, which in some Lodges resem∣bles the grand building, termed a Mosaic Palace, and is de∣scribed with the utmost exactness. They also draw other figures, one of which is called the Laced Tuft, and the other, the Throne beset with Stars. There is also represented a per∣pendicular line in the form of a Masons' instrument, com∣monly called the Plumb-Line; and another figure which represents the Tomb of <HI>Hiram,</HI> the first Grand Master, who has been dead almost three thousand years. These are all explained to him in the most accurate manner, and the orna∣ments or emblems of the Order are described with great fa∣cility. The ceremony being now ended, the new made member is obliged to take a mop out of a pail of water brought for that purpose, and rub out the drawing on the floor, if it is done with chalk and charcoal. Then he is con∣ducted back, and every thing that he was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>csted of is re∣stored, and he takes his seat on the right hand of the Master. He also receives an apron, which he puts on, and the list of the Lodges is likewise given him.</P>
<P>The Brethren now congratulate the new-made member, and all return to the table to regale themselves; when the Master proposes a health to the young Brother, which is drank with the greatest applause by the whole body, the new Mason sitting all the while. After which he, instructed by a Brother, takes a bumper, and drinks <Q>To the Wor∣shipful Grand Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens, the rest of the Officers and Members of the Lodge, wish∣ing them success in all their public and private under∣takings, to Masonry in general, and that Lodge in par∣ticular, craving their assistance.</Q> To which they answer, "they will assist him." And after he has drank, the throws his glass from him, and brings it back three times, and then sets it down on the table, the rest doing the same in exact order. This they call firing: then they clap their hands nine times divided into three, and stop between each, keeping true time.</P>
<P>The reader having been led thus far, it is high time to introduce the Apprentice's Lecture, which is intended not only to amuse, but likewise to instruct him in the part he is entered into. The readiness of many of the Brethren in answering the questions, adds a lustre to the Order, the members vying with each other who shall most contribute to the edification of their new Brother.</P>

<P>O LORD God, thou great and universal Mason of the World, and first builder of man, as it were a temple; be with us, O Lord, as thou has promised, when two or three are gathered together in thy name, thou wilt be in the midst of them: be with, O Lord, and bless all our undertakings, and grant that this our friend may become a faithful Brother. Let grace and peace be multiplied unto him, through the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; and grant, O Lord, as he putteth forth his hand to thy Holy Word, that he may also put forth his Hand to serve a Brother, but not to hurt himself or his Family; that wereby may be given to us great and precious Promises, that by this we may be Partakers of thy divine nature, having escaped the corruption that this is in the world through lust.</P>
<P>O Lord God, add to our faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to tem∣perance prudence, and to prudence patience, and to pati∣ence godliness, and to godliness brotherly love, and to brotherly love charity; and grant, O Lord, that Masonry may be blessed throughout the world, and thy peace be upon us, O Lord, and grant that we may be all united as one, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>What are their uses?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Square to square my work, the 24 Inch Guage to measure my work, the common Gaval to knock off all super∣fluous matter, whereby the Square may fit easy and just.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, as we are not all working Masons, we apply them to our morals, which we call spiritualizing: Explain them.</P>

<P>The 24 Inch Guage represents the 24 hours of the day.</P>

<P>Six hours to work in, six hours to serve God, and six to serve a friend or a brother, as far as lies in my power, with∣out being detrimental to myself or family.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY was you neither naked nor clothed, bare∣footed nor shod, with a cable-tow (or halter) about your neck?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had recanted, and ran out in the street, the peo∣ple would have said I was mad; but if a brother had seen me, he would have brought me back, and seen me done justice by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why was you hood-winked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>That my heart may conceal before my eyes did dis∣cover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>The second reason, Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I was in darkness at that time, I should keep all the world in darkness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why was you deprived of all metal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I should bring nothing offensive or defensive in the Lodge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me the second season brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I was poor and pennyless when I was made a Ma∣son, it informed me that I should assist all poor and pennyless, brethren as far as lay in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, you told me you gave three distinct knocks at the door: Pray what do they signify?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>A certain text in scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that text?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Ask and you shall have; seek, and you shall find; "knock, and it shall be opened unto you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you apply this text in Masonry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sought in my mind; I asked of my friend; I knocked and the door of Masonry became open unto me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why had you a sword, spear, or some other war∣like instrument presented to your naked left breast parti∣cularly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the left breast is the nearest the heart, that it might be the more a prick to my conscience, as it pricked my flesh at that time.</P>

<P>That all the Brethern might see I was duly prepared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you was made an Apprentice, why was your left knee bare bent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the left knee is the weakest part of my body, and an Entered Apprentice is the weakest part of Masonry, into which degree I was then entering.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do three make a Lodge?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>What use are they, Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hearing is to hear the word; seeing is to see the sign; feeling is to feel thee grip, that I may know a Bro∣ther as well in the dark as in the light.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should the Master represent the Pillar of Wisdom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he gives Instructions to the Crafts to carry on their work in a proper manner, with good harmony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should the Senior Warden represent the Pillar of Strength?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the sun sets to finish the day, so the Senior Warden stands in the west to pay the hirelings their wages, which is the strength and support of all business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should the Junior Warden represent the Pillar of Beauty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he stands in the south at high twelve at noon, which is the beauty of the day, to call the men off from work to refreshment, and to see that they come on again in due time, that the Master may have pleasure and profit therein.</P>

<STAGE>[The Entered Apprentice's Lecture being finished, it is customary for the Master to call upon one of the Brethren, who can best acquit himself, for the following song, which is always readily complied with.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>SONG, <HI>at the Conclusion of the Entered Apprentice's</HI> LECTURE.
<L>COME, let us prepare,</L>
<L>We Brothers that are,</L>
<L>Assembled on ev'ry Occasion;</L>
<L>Let us drink, laugh, and sing,</L>
<L>Our Wine has a Spring;</L>

<L>And still let them wonder and gaze on!</L>

They ne'er can divine,</L>
<L>The Word or the Sign</L>
<L>Of a free and an Accepted Mason,</L>
<L>'Tis this, and 'tis that,</L>
<L>They cannot tell what,</L>
<L>Why so many great men of the nation,</L>
<L>Should aprons put on,</L>
<L>To make themselves one,</L>
<L>With a free and an Accepted Mason.</L>
<L>Great kings, dukes, and lords,</L>
<L>Have laid by their swords,</L>
<L>Our Myst'ry to put a good grace on;</L>
<L>And ne'er been asham'd</L>
<L>To hear themselves nam'd,</L>
<L>With a free and an Accepted Mason.</L>
<L>Antiquity's pride,</L>
<L>We have on our side,</L>
<L>And it maketh men just in their station;</L>
<L>There's nought but what's good,</L>
<L>To be understood,</L>
<L>By a free and an Accepted Mason.</L>
<L>We're true and sincere,</L>
<L>And just to the fair,</L>
<L>Who will trust us on ev'ry occasion;</L>
<L>No mortal can more</L>
<L>The ladies adore,</L>
<L>Than a free and an Accepted Mason.</L>
<L>Then join hand and hand,</L>
<L>T'each other firm stand,</L>
<L>Let's be merry, and put a bright face on;</L>
<L>What mortal can boast,</L>
<L>So noble a toast,</L>
<L>As a free and an Accepted Mason?</L></STAGE>
<P>While this song is singing, they all stand round the table, and when they come to the last verse they join hands cross∣ways in the following manner: the right hand man takes hold of the left hand of his neighbour with his right hand: and the left hand man takes hold of the right hand of his next Brother with his left hand, so as to form a chain by so many links, and all join in the chorus, jumping violently with their feet on the floor, and shaking their hands up and down, linked together as above, keeping exact time with both.</P>
<P>Every one now talks of what he pleases; and as it is gene∣rally half an hour before they proceed to business, those who perhaps have ordered a supper retire into another room;
<PB REF="031147_0027_0FEAE8A94A4CEEB0"/>but before they are permited, the Master proceeds <HI>to call the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off from work,</HI> as it is termed, which is done in this manner: the Master whispers to the Senior Deacon, who sits on his right hand, and says, "It is high time to call the men from work to refresh themselves:" The Senior Deacon whispers it to the Senior Warden; and it is communicated from him to the Junior Deacon, who carries it to the Junior Warden; he preclaims it openly to the Lodge, and sets his column up∣right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Senior and Junior Warden's Columns are about twenty-five inches long, and represent the Columns that support the Porch of <HI>Solomon's</HI> Tem∣ple; The Senior's is called JACHIN, and signifies <HI>Strength;</HI> the Junior's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OAZ, and signifies, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Lord.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the First <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of King's, Chap. VII.</NOTE>, and the Senior Warden lays his down, which signi∣fies that the Junior Warden is intrusted with the care of the Lodge, while the Brethren refresh themselves.</P>
<P>In this place it will be necessary to acquaint the reader how he may discover an Entered Apprentice by drinking with him in company. Take the glass with your right hand, and draw it across your throat, either before or after you drink; and if an Apprentice is present, he will imme∣diately take notice of it, by asking you some question in Masonry, which you will readily answer from this book. If he asks you the meaning of your doing that, you may whisper to him, that it is the penalty of the Obligation of an Entered Apprentice. From this answer he will proceed farther in his Inquiry.</P>
<P>The Brethern having now regaled themselves, they take their seats, and the master proceeds to set them on again, which is performed in the same manner as the calling off; with this difference, the Warden proclaims, <Q>It is our Worshipful Master's pleasure that this Lodge is called from refreshment to work.</Q> The Junior Warden lays down his Column, and the Senior sets his up. But as it often happens, that the time will not permit for the Fellow-Craft's Lecture, they close the Lodge, which is done after the same manner as that of opening. The Senior Warden declares it in the following words: <Q>It is our Master's will and pleasure, that this Lodge stand closed till the first or third Wednesday in the next month,</Q> according to the night the Lodge is held. Then the Master, Wardens, Deacons, Secretary, &amp;c. take off the Ensigns and Orna∣ments from their necks, and every one is at liberty to de∣part or stay longer; every thing of Masonry is excluded; they talk of what they please, and sing various songs for their amusement.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to the second degree of Masonry, cal∣led the <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI>'s: that is, one who has served his time justly and lawfully as an Entered Apprentice, and desires to
<PB REF="031147_0028_0FEAE8AD4F81C5B8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> perfect in Masonry, by being admitted a Fel∣low-Craft. But in most Lodges at this time, they are made entered apprentices and Fellow-Craft the same evening. The ceremony is the same, though they have different lectures, pass∣word, and grip belonging to each.</P>

B.</HI> of my own free will and accord, and in the presence of Almighty God, and this Right Worshipful Lodge, dedicated to St. <HI>John,</HI> do hereby swear, that I will always hale, conceal, and never reveal, that part of a Fellow-Craft to an Entered Apprentice, or either of them, except it be in a true and lawful Lodge of Crafts, him or them whom I shall find to be such, after just trial and examination. I do furthermore swear, that I will answer all signs and summonses sent to me from a Lodge of Crafts, within the length of a cable-tow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Cable Tow is three miles in length: so that if a Fellow-Craft is at that distance from his Lodge, he is not culpable on account of his Non-Attendance.</NOTE>. I also swear, that I will not wrong a Brother, nor see him wronged, but give him timely notice of all approaching dangers whatsoever, as far as in me is. I will also serve a Brother as much as lies in my power, without being detrimental to myself or family: and I will keep all my Brother's secrets as my own, that shall be delivered to me as such, murder and treason excepted. All this I swear, with a firm and steady resolution to perform the same, without any equivocation or hesitation in me what∣soever, under no less penalty than to have my heart torn from my naked left breast, and given to the vultures of the air as a prey. So help me God, and keep me stedfast in this my Fellow-Craft's obligation.</Q><HI>[Kisses the Book.]</HI></P>

<P>This generally finishes the Fellow-Craft's lecture, and very few Lodges go so far in their questions and answers: there∣fore, in order to enliven the company, the Master asks some good singer to favour them with the following song, which I have heard sung with great energy and rapture throughout the Lodge; every Brother bearing a part in the chorus.</P>

<P>"It being always the Custom of <HI>Hiram,</HI> at twelve at noon, as soon as the men were called off to refresh them∣selves, to go into the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> or holy of holies, to pay his devotion to the true and living God, the three assassins above-mentioned placed themselves at the east, west, and south doors of the temple. At the north there was no entrance, because the rays of the sun never dart from that point.</P>
<P>"<HI>Hiram,</HI> having finished his prayer to the Lord, came to the east door, which he found guarded by <HI>Jubela,</HI> who demanded the Master's grip in a resolute manner; he re∣ceived for answer from <HI>Hiram,</HI> that it was not customary

This is the custom in most Lodges; and it requires no small share of courage, for the blows are fre∣quently so severe that the poor candidate falls backwards on the floor; and the greater his terror at this usage, the more the Brethern are pleased. This custom favours too much of barbarity; and many instances can be produced of persons in this situation, who have requested on their knees to be set at liberty, and others who have made their escape as fast as possible out of the Lodge. The <HI>French</HI> and Natives of <HI>Swisserland</HI> have a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iking and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olemn</HI> way of representing the death of <HI>Hiram.</HI> When a Brother comes into the Lodge, in order to be raised to the degree of Master, one of the members lies flat on his back, with his face disfigured, and be∣smeared with blood, on the spot where the drawing on the floor is made. His natural surprize and confusion immediately appears, and one of the Bre∣thren generally addresses him to the purport following: <Q>Brother, be not frightened; this is the unfortunate remains of a worthy Master, that would not deliver the grip and word to three Fellow-Crafts, who had no right to it; and from this example we learn our duty. viz. to die before we deliver the Master's part of Masonry to those who have no claim thereto.</Q> On kneeling to receive the obligation, the supposed dead Brother lies behind you, and during the time of administering the oath, and reading the history of his death, he gets up, and you are laid down in his place.

<P>As I lay on my back, the master informed me how <HI>Hiram</HI> was found; and by what means the three ruffians were discovered, as follows:</P>
<P>"Our master <HI>Hiram</HI> not coming to view the workmen as usual, king <HI>Solomon</HI> caused strict search to be made; but this proving ineffectual, he was supposed to be dead. The twelve fellow-crafts who recanted, hearing the report, their consciences priching them, went to <HI>Solomon</HI> with white aprons and gloves, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lems of their innocence, and in∣forming him of every thing relative to the affair, as far as they knew, and offered their assistance in order to discover the three other Fellow-Crafts, who had absconded. They separated, and divided themselves into four parties; three east, west, north and south, in quest of the murderers. As one of the twelve was travelling on the sea-side, near <HI>Joppa,</HI> being fatigued, he sat down to refresh himself: but was soon alarmed by the following hideous exclamations from the cliff of a rock: <Q>Oh! that my throat had been cut across, my tongue torn out by the root, and buried in the sands of the sea at low-water mark, a cable's length from the shore, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, e'er I had consented to the death of our Grand Master <HI>Hiram!</HI>"—"Oh! (says another) that my heart had been torn from under my naked left breast, and given a prey to the vultures of the air, rather than I had been concerned in the death of so good a Master!" But (says a third) I struck him harder than you both; 'twas I that killed him. Oh! that my body had been sever∣ed in two, and scattered to the south and north; my bow∣els burnt to ashes in the south, and scattered between the four winds of the earth, ere I had been the cause of the death of our good Master <HI>Hiram!</HI></Q> The Fellow-Craft bearing this, went in quest of his two afs;sociates, and they entered the cliff of the rock, took and bound them fast, and brought them to king <HI>Solomon,</HI> before whom they voluntarily confessed their guilt, and begged to die. The sentence passed on them was the same as they expressed in their lamentation in the cliff; <HI>Jubela</HI>'s throat was cut across; <HI>Jubela</HI>'s heart was
<PB N="32" REF="031147_0038_0FEAE8C8B9C922F8"/>torn from under his left breast; and <HI>Jubelam</HI>'s body was sever∣ed in two, and scattered in the south and north.</P>
<P>"When the execution was over, king <HI>Solomon</HI> sent for the twelve Crafts, and desired them to take the body of <HI>Hiram</HI> up, in order that it might be interred in a solemn manner in the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum;</HI> he also told them, that if they could not find a key-word about him, it was lost; for there were only three in the world to whom it was known; and unless they were present it could not be delivered, <HI>Hiram</HI> being dead it consequently was lost. However, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ordered, they went and cleared the rubbish, and found their Master in a mangled condition, having lain fifteen days; upon which they lifted up their hands above their heads in astonishment, and said, <HI>O Lord, my God!</HI> This being the first word and sign, king <HI>Solomon</HI> adopted it as the grand sign of a Master Mason, and it is used at this day in all the Lodges of Masters.</P>

<P>Hand in hand signifies that I will always put forth my hand to serve a Brother as far as in my power lies.— Foot to foot, that I never will be afraid to go a foot out of my way to serve a Brother.—Knee to knee, that when I pray, I should never forget my Brother's welfare.—Breast to breast, to shew I will keep my Brother's secrets as my own.— The left hand supporting the back, that I will always support a Brother, as far as I can, without being detrimental to my own family.</P>

<P><HI>The form observed at the inftalment of a Master, and the other Officers, on St.</HI> John's <HI>day.</HI></P>
<P>THE year being expired, a proper person is fixed on by the Members of every Lodge to preside over and govern the societies in the capacity of Master. The Qualifications for this office are, <HI>1st,</HI> that he must be regularly and lawfully raised: <HI>2dly,</HI> He ought to be a man of good character, and irreproachable in his private conduct: <HI>3dly,</HI> He must be well versed in the laws and constitutions of the order, and ought to be temperate, cool, and quite perfect in going through the before-mentioned lectures, as all the questions are put by him, and he is often obliged to assist the brethern in making the proper answers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been in a Lodge, where the Master was quite ignorant of the common rules of Grammer; frequently making such egregious blanders, that the Brethern could scarce refrain from bursling into Laughter; and often embellishing his Questions with, <Q>Brether you have <HI>let a body know as how</HI> you cannot be raised but by the five points of fellowship, &amp;c <HI>tell us which they be.</HI></Q></NOTE>; for every Mason sitting round the table answers in his turn, in the same manner as boys at church saying the catechism. This is termed <HI>Working.</HI> For Instance;
<PB REF="031147_0040_0FEAE8CC4B1DCF58"/>Suppose a Brother meets another, and asks him if he was at his Lodge last night? He says, yes. Well, replied the other, <HI>did you work?</HI> that is, did you go through the several ques∣tions and answers in any of the lectures?—If any member cannot, or does not chuse <HI>to work,</HI> when the question is put, and it comes to his turn, he gets up, and clapping his hand on his breast, addresses himself to the Master, and begs to be excused; then the left hand man answers in his room.</P>
<P>The Brethren having chose a proper man for this office, and he being approved of by the Grand Master, they proceed to the installing him as follows: he kneels down in the south part of the Lodge, and the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Master gives him the following obligation before he resigns the chair, which he repeats:</P>
<P><Q>I—<HI>A.

All this I swear, with a firm and steadfast resolution to perform the same, under no less than the four following penalties: My throat cut across, my tongue torn out, my heart torn from my left breast, and my body severed in two. So help me God, and assist me in this my obligation belonging to the chair..</Q><HI>[Kisses the book.]</HI></P>
<P>The Past Master raises him up, and takes off the jewels and ribbon from his own neck, and puts it on the new Master, taking him at the same time by the Master's grip, and whisper∣ing in his ear the word CHIBBELUM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHIBBELUM signifies a worthy Mason. The origin of the words and signs among Free Masons was on this account: <HI>Haram</HI> the chief archi∣tect of the temple, had so great a number of workmen to pay, that he could not possibly know them all; he therefore gave each degree or class, a particular sign and word, by which he could distinguish them more readily in order to pay them their different salaries.</NOTE>; after which he slips his hand from the Master's grip to the elbow, and presses his nails in, as is done in the grip of the Master under the wrist.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0041_0FEAE8D4EB07AFA0"/>
The Senior and Junior Warden, Secretary, &amp;c. receive the obligation as the master, except the grip and word; there being none peculiar to them.</P>
<P>Having now gone through the several degrees and lectures belonging to the Entered Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, Master, and the manner of instalment, I shall close the work with a few general directions, dividing them under the following heads:</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>A description of the ornaments worn by the different effects when assembled in the Lodge, and their proper places of sitting.</HI></P>
<P>The MASTER, who sits in the cast of the lodge, has the rule and compass, and the square hanging to a ribbon round his neck, and a black rod in his hand, when he opens the lodge, near seven feet high.</P>
<P>The SENIOR WARDEN, sits in the west, with a level hanging by a ribbon round his neck, and a column placed on the table about twenty-nine inches long.</P>
<P>The JUNIOR WARDEN's place is in the south, with the plumb rule hanging by a ribbon from his neck, and a column in his hand.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY wears the cross-pens, hanging in the same manner.</P>
<P>The Senior and Junior DEACONS have each a black rod, with the compass hanging round their necks; the Senior sits at the back of the Master, or at his right hand; the Junior at the Senior Warden's right hand.</P>
<P>The PAST-MASTER has the compasses and sun, with a line of cords about his neck.</P>
<P>The TREASURER has a key hanging from his neck.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The manner of giving the signs of each degree, and the word belonging to it, with the Fellow-Craft and Master's Clap.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Master's Sign, Grip, and Word, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The sign.</HI> Draw the right hand edgeways across your belly, which is the penalty of the obligation.</P>
<P><HI>The Grip.</HI> Take hold of the right hand of your brother with your right hand, and press the four finger nails hard under the wrist of his right hand; put your right foot to his right foot: your right knee to his right knee; and his right breast to yours, with your left hand supporting his back.</P>
<P><HI>The word</HI> is MAHABONE; or, in some Lodges, MAC∣BENACH.</P>
<P><HI>The pass-word</HI> is TUBAL-CAIN.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0042_0FEAE8D67AFF2E10"/>
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mayer's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> is by holding bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s above your head, and striking them down at once upon your apron, both feet keeping time. They assign two rea∣sons for this sign, <HI>viz.</HI> when the twelve Fellow-Crafts saw ther Master he dead, they lifted up their hands in surprize, and said, <HI>O Lord our God!</HI> and that when <HI>Solomon</HI> dedicated the temple to the Lord, he stood up, and lifting up both his hands, exclaimed, <HI>O Lord my God, great art thou above all Gods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Fellow-Craft's sign, grip, word, and clap.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sign.</HI> Put your right hand to your left breast, keeping your thumb square, and your left hand upright, forming a square.</P>
<P><HI>The pass-grip,</HI> is by putting the thumb nail of your right hand between the first and second joint of a Brother's right hand.</P>
<P><HI>The pass-word</HI> is SHIBBOLETH.</P>
<P><HI>The grip</HI> is the same as the pass-grip, except pressing your thumb nail on the <HI>second</HI> joint instead of between the first and second.</P>
<P><HI>The word</HI> is BOAZ.</P>
<P><HI>The Fellow-Craft's clap</HI> is by forming the sign of a Craft as above, holding your left hand square and upright; then clap your right and left hands together; and afterwards strike your left breast with your right hand, and from thence give a slap on your apron, your right foot going at the same time.</P>
<P><HI>The Entered Apprentice's sign, grip, and word.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The sign.</HI> Draw your hand across your throat edgeways. the penalty of the obligation being this, that an Appientice would sooner have his throat cut than discover the secrets of Masonry.</P>
<P><HI>The grip.</HI> Take a Brother with your right hand, and press hard with your thumb nail upon the first joint of the fore∣finger of his right hand.</P>
<P><HI>The word.</HI> Whisper in his ear JACHIN.</P>
<P>The Master kneels upon both knees in the ceremony of making.</P>
<P>The Craft kneels with the right knee.</P>
<P>The Apprentice with the left knee.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The form observed in drinking.</HI></P>
<P>The table being plentifully stored with wine and punch, &amp;c. every man his a glass set before him, and fills it with
<PB REF="031147_0043_0FEAE8D9B7A8D338"/>what he chooses, and as often as he pleases. But he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drink his glass in turn, or at least keep the motion with the rest. When therefore a public health is given, the Master fills first, and desires the Brethern to charge their glasses: and when this is supposed to be done, the Master says, <HI>Brethern, are you all charged?</HI> The Senior and Junior Wardens answer, <HI>We are all charged in the south and west.</HI> Then they all stand up, and observing the Master's motion, (like the soldier his right hand man) drink their glasses off; and if the Master proposes the heath or toast with <HI>three times three claps,</HI> they throw the glasses with the right hand at full length, bringing them across their throats three times, and making three motions to put them down on the table; at the third they are set down, (though perhaps fifty in number) as if it was but one: then raising their hands breast high, they clap nine times against the right, divided into three divisions, which is termed <HI>Drinking with three times three,</HI> and at the end they give a huzza.</P>
<P>Having at length gone through my plan, I have nothing further to add than this, that the following is the best method for a stranger to gain admittance, being what I have often tried in many places, in order to be fully satisfied.</P>
<P>As soon as you come to the door of the Lodge, you will find the Tyler on the outside, with a drawn sword in his hand, and a white apron on. Ask him if there is a full Lodge? And tell him you should be glad of admittance as a visiting member; taking care to provide yourself with a white leather apron, which you may shew him as if by ac∣cident. He will, perhaps, ask you what degree you are of, and desire a sign, which you may shew him with Readiness, and likewise inform him what Lodge you belong to.</P>
<P>It being contrary to the Rules of the society that the Tyler should admit a stranger, he will go in, and acquaint the Master, that such a person (mentioning your name, and the Lodge you told him you belonged to) craves admittance, upon which one of the Wardens will come out to examine you, draw your right hand across your throat edgeways, and he will say, "Whats that?" Your answer must be "The due guard of an Apprentice." Then he will take you by the first joint of the thumb of your right hand, and press it hand with the thumb-nail of the right hand, and ask, "What's this?"—You must immediately answer, "The grip of an Entered Apprentice."—If he is not fully satisfied with this, he will go further on in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Ques.</HI> Has it got a name?—You must answer, "It has." Then he will ask you to give it him.</P>

<P><HI>Ques.</HI> Will you be of or from? <HI>Ans</HI> From.</P>
<P><HI>Ques.</HI> From what? <HI>Ans.</HI> From an Entered Apprentice to a Fellow-Craft. He will then shift his thumb from the Ap∣prentice's grip towards the Fellow-Craft's, and ask. What's this? <HI>Ans.</HI> The pass-word of a Fellow-Craft. Give it me, says he. Whisper in his car SHIBBOLETH. On this he will pat his thumb to the second joint, and say. What's this? <HI>Ans.</HI> The grip of a Fellow-Craft. Has it a name? says he. <HI>Ans.</HI> It has. Prav give it me. <HI>Ans.</HI> I will letter it or halve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with you. <HI>Mason,</HI> I'll letter it with you. <HI>Ans.</HI> Begin. <HI>Mason.</HI> No. you begin. <HI>Ans.</HI> B. <HI>Mason,</HI> O. <HI>Ans.</HI> A. <HI>Mason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ans.</HI> BOAZ.</P>

If there should be a making that night, you will be perfect in the first principles, and know more than one in ten who have been Malous many years, and have never read this book.</P>
<P>If you should, after this, chuse to go to a Lodge of Masters, the ceremony is the same as above; but you are interrogated as to the grip, pass-grip, and word of a Master, which you cannot fail of answering by reading the Master's part before mentioned. In all this you must take care not to betray any fear, but put on an air of assurance.</P>
<P><HI>The ceremony observed at the Free-Masons sunerals, according to ancient custom.</HI></P>
<P>No Mason can be interred with the formalities of the Order, unless by his own especial request, communicated to the Master of the lodge of which he died a member: nor unless he had been advanced to the third degree of Masonry.</P>
<P>The Master of the lodge, on receiving intelligence of his death, and being made acquainted with the day and hour appointed for his funeral, is to issue his commands for sum∣moning the lodge; and immediately to make application, by the grand Secretaty, to the deputary Grand Master, for a legal power and authority to attend the procession, with his officers and such Brethern as he may approve of, properly clothed.</P>
<P>The dispensation being obtained, the Master may invite as many Lodges as he thinks proper, and the members of the said Lodges many accompany their officers in form; but the whole ceremony must be under the direction of the Master of the lodge to which the deceased belonged; and he, and his officers must be duly honoured and chearfully obeyed on the occasion.</P>

Decent mourning, with white steekings, gloves, and aprons is most sailable and becoming. No person ought to be distin∣guished with a jewel, unless he is an officer of one of the Lodges united to attend in form, and the officers of such Lodges should be ornamented with white fashes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣bands: as alto the officers of the Lodge to whom the dis∣pensation is granted, who should likewise be distinguished with white rods.</P>
<P>In the procession to the place of interment, the different Lodges rank according to their semority; the junior ones preceding. Each Lodge forms one division, and the follow∣ing order is observed.</P>
<P>The Tyler with his sword; The Stewards with white rods; The Brethren out of office, two and two; The Secretary with a roll; The Treasurer with his badge of office; Senior and Junior Wardens, hand in hand; The Past-Master, The Master. The Lodge to which the deceased Brother belonged, in the following order; all the members having flowers or herbs in their hands. The Tyler; The Stewards; The music [drums muffled, and trumpets covered;] The members of the Lodge; The Secretary and Treasurer; The Senior and Junior Wardens; The Past-Master. The bible and book of constitutions on a cushion, covered with black cloth, carried by a member of the Lodge: The MASTER. The Choristers singing an anthem. The Clergyman: Pall bearers, The BODY, with the regalia plac∣ed thereon, and two swords crossed. Pall bearers, Chief Mourner; Assistant Mourners; Two Stewards; A Tyler.</P>

One or two Lodges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch, before the procession begans to the church-yard, to prevent confusion, and make the neces∣sary preparations. The Brethren are on no account to desert then ranks or change their places, but keep in their different departments.

In returning from the funeral, the same order of procession is to be observed.</P>
<P>This is the whole of Masonry in all its branches; and I defy any Mason to prove the contrary, being ready to answer any question proposed, which must be carefully sealed up, and directed for R.

And as to any annonymous letters or threatnings on account of this publication, they will be treated with contempt, let them come from what quarter they will.
