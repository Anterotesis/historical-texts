<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy charitable gentle∣man, was travelling some time ago across one of those vast plains which are well known in Wiltshire. It was a fine summer's evening, and he rode slowly that he might have leisure to admire God in the works of his creation; for this gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride was as proper a time as any to think a∣bout good things, for which reason, on such occasions, he seldom thought so much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more ease and satisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the visible works of the great Maker of heaven and earth are intended to raise in the mind.</P>
<P>His attention was all of a sudden called off by the barking of a shepherd's dog, and looking up he spied one of those little huts, which are here and there to be seen on these great Downs; and near it was the shepherd himself busily employed with his dog in collecting toge∣ther his vast flock of sheep. As he drew nearer he per∣ceived him to be a clean, well looking, poor man, near fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty years of age. His coat, though at first it had pro∣bably been of one dark colour, had been in along course of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so often patched with different sorts of clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,
<PB N="4" REF="035296_0003_1001BF872A9C5EF8"/>that it was now become hard to say which had been the orginal colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the shepherd's poverty, equally proved the exceeding neatness, industry and good management of his wife.— His stockings no less proved her good house wifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different co∣loured worsted, but had not a hole in them; and his shirt, though nearly as coarse as the sails of a ship, was as white as the drifted snow, and nearly mended where time had either made a rent, or worn it thin. This is a rule of judging, by which one shall seldom be deceived. If I meet with a laborer hedging, ditching, or mend∣ing the highways with his stockings and shirt tight and whole, however mean and bad his other garments are, I have seldom failed, on visiting his cottage, to find that also clean and well ordered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor woman, who will be lying a-bed, or gossipping with her neigh∣bors, when she ought to be fitting out her husband in a cleanly manner, will seldom be found to be very good in other respects.</P>
<P>This was not the case with our shepherd; and Mr. Johnson was not more struck with the decency of his mean and frugal dress, than with his open honest counte∣nance, which bore strong marks of health, cheerfulness, and spirit.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson, who was on a journey, and somewhat fearful from the appearance of the sky, that rain was at no great distance, accosted the shepherd with asking what sort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.—"It will be such weather as pleases me," an∣swered the shepherd. Though the answer was delivered in the mildest and civilest tone that could be imagined, the gentleman thought the words themselves rather rude and surly, and asked him how that could be, "Because," replied the shepherd "it will be such weather as shall please God, and whatever pleases hun always pleases <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035296_0004_1001BF8E4FD9FBC0"/>
Mr. Johnson, who delighted in good men and good things, was very well satisfied with his reply: for he justly thought, that though an hypocrite may easily con∣trive to appear better than he really is to a stranger; and that no one should be too soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alted, merely for hav∣ing a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh," he always accustomed himself to judge fa∣vorably of those who had a serious deportment and so∣lid manner of speaking. "It looks as if it proceeded from a good habit," said he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be so. Whereas, if a man accosts me with an idle, dissolute, vurgar, indecent, or profane expression, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally, on enquiry, found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</P>
<P>He entered into conversation with the shepherd in the following manner. Yours is a troublesome life, hon∣est friend, said he. To be sure, sir, replied the shepherd, it is not a very lazy life; but it is not near so toilsome as that which my GREAT MASTER led for my sake, and he had every state and condition of life at his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce, and chose a hard one, while I only submit to the lot that is appointed me. You are exposed to great cold and near, said the gentleman; true, sir, said the shepherd; but then I am not exposed to great temptations; and so throwing one thing against another, God is pleased to contrive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, short-sighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's sheep on such a plain as this, and singing some of his own ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ms, perhaps, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r he was when he became king of Israc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Judah. And I dare say we should never have had some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautiful texts in all those fine psalms, if he had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hepherd, which enabled m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to make so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comparisons and similitudes, as one may say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="035296_0005_1001BF9256F17578"/>country life, flocks of sheep, hills, and vallies, and foun∣tains of water.</P>
<P>You think then, said the gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, sir, and more so especially, as it exposes a man to fewer sins. If King Saul had con∣tinued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and honest, and died a natural death in his bed at last, which you know, sir, was more than he did. But I speak with reverence, for it was di∣vine Providence over-rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all that, you know, sir, and I do not presume to make comparisons. Besides, sir, my employment has been particularly honored—Moses was a shepherd in the plains of Midian. It was to "shep∣herds keeping then flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the best news, the glad∣dest tidings, that ever were revealed to poor sinful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the coldest night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulness than the best supper could have done.</P>
<P>Here the shepherd stopped, for he began to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. Johnson was so well pleased with what he said, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he said it, that he desired him to go on freely, for that it was a pleasure to him to meet with a plain man, who, without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk so well on a subject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</P>
<P>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, sir, for it better becomes me to listen to such a gentleman as you seem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was say∣ing, sir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do from thinking how God has honored po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty!—Oh! sir, what great, or rich, or mighty men have had such honor put on them, or their condition, as shepherds, tent-makers, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and car∣penters have had!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035296_0006_1001BF98E2731F50"/>
My honest friend, said the gentleman, I perceive you are well acquainted with scripture. Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, pretty w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, blessed be God! through his mercy I learnt to read when I was a little boy; though reading was not so com∣mon when I was a child, as, I am tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, thro' the good∣ness of Providence, and the generosity of the rich, it is likely to become now-a-days. I believe there is no day for the last thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible. If we can't find time to read a chapter, I defy any man to say he can't find time to read a verse; and a single text, sir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and sixty-five texts, without the loss of a mo∣ment's time, would make a pretty stock, a little golden treasury, as one may say, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfast. No laboring man, it is true, has so much leisure as a shepherd, for while the flock is feed∣ing, I am obliged to be still, and at such times I can now and then tap a shoe for my children or myself, which is a great saving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time pass pleasantly in this wild solitary place. I can say the best part of the Bible by heart, I believe I should not say the best part, for every part is good, but I mean the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est part.—I have led but a lonely life, and have often had but lit∣tle to eat, but my Bible has been meat, drink, and com∣pany to me, as I may say, and when want and trouble had come upon me, I don't know what I should have done indeed, sir, if I had not had the promises of this book for my stay and support.</P>
<P>You have had great difficulties then? said Mr. John∣son. Why, as to that, sir, not more than neighbors fare, I have but little cause to complain, and much to be thankful, but I have had some little struggles, as I will leave you to judge.—I have a wife and eight children,
<PB N="8" REF="035296_0007_1001BF9C833B4D10"/>whom I bred up in that little cottage which you s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e un∣der the hill about hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mile off. What, that with the smoke coming out of the chimney, said the gentleman. O no, sir, replied the shepherd smiling, we have seldom smoke in the evening, for we have little to cook, and firing is very dear in these parts. It is that cottage which you see on the left hand of the church, near that little tuft of hawthorns. What, that hovel with only one room above and one below, with scarcely any chimney, how is it possible you can live there with such a fami∣ly! O! it is very possible and very certain too, cried the shepherd. How many better men have been worse lodged! how many good christians have perished in prisons and dungeons, in comparison of which my cot∣tage is a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce. The house is very well, sir, and if the rain did not sometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a-bed, I should not desire a better; for I have health, peace, and liberty, and no man maketh me afraid.</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, I will certainly call on you before it be long; but how can you contrive to lodge so many children?—We do the best we can, sir. My poor wife is a very sickly woman, or we should always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the parish, so that she has not met with any great assistance in her sickness. The good curate of the parish, who lives in that pretty par∣sonage in the valley, is very willing, but not very able to assist us on these trying occasions, for he has little e∣nough for himself and a large family into the bargain. Yet he does what he can, and more than many richer men do, and more than he can well afford. Besides that, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prayers and good advice we are always sure of, and we are truly thankful for that, for a man must give, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, according to what he hath, and not according to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he hath not.</P>
<P>Are you in any distress at present? said Mr. John∣son. No, sir, thank God, replied the shephered. I g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my
<PB N="9" REF="035296_0008_1001BFA0C5366190"/>shilling a-day, and most of my children will soon be a∣ble to earn something; for we have only three under five years of age. Only! said the gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it.—Tho' my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet she breeds up our children to such habits of industry that our little maids, before they are six years old can first get a halfpenny, and then a penny a-day by knit∣ting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or twopence, and now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then a bit of bread and cheese into the bargain.—When the season of crow-keeping is over, then they glean or pick stones; any thing is better than idleness, sir, and if they do not get a farthing by it, I would make them do it just the same, for the sake of giving them early habits of labor.</P>
<P>So you see, sir, I am not so badly off as many are; nay, it it were not that it costs me so much in 'Peteca∣ry's stuff for my poor wife, I should reckon myself well off. Nay, I do reckon myself well off, for blessed be God, he has granted her li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to my prayers, and I would work myself to a 'nato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, and live on one meal a-day to add any comfort to her valuable life; indeed I have of∣ten done the last, and thought it no great matter nei∣ther.</P>
<P>While they were in this part of the discourse, a sine p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mp cherry-check little gul ran up out of breath, with a same on her young happy face, and, without taking any notice of the gentleman, cried out with great joy—Look here, father, only see how much I have got to∣day! Mr. Johnson was much struck with her simplicity, but puzzled to know what was the occation of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a small quan∣tity of coarse wool, some of which had found its way through the holes of her clean, but scanty and ragged wooll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n apron. The father said;, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has been a success∣ful
<PB N="10" REF="035296_0009_1001BFA7E9AD8670"/>day indeed, Molly, but don't you see the gentleman? Molly, now made a curtsey down to the very ground; while Mr. Johnson equired into the cause of the mu∣tual satisfaction which both father and daughter had ex∣pressed, at the unusual good fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Sir, said the shepherd, poverty is a great sharpener of wits.—My wife and I cannot endure to see our children (poor as they are) without shoes and stockings, not on∣ly on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but because it degrades and debases them; and poor people, who have but little regard to ap∣pearances, will seldom be found to have any great re∣gard for honesty and goodness; I don't say this is al∣ways the case, but I am sure it is so too often. Now shoes and stockings being very dear, we could never af∣ford to get them without a little contrivance. I must shew you how I manage about the shoes, when you con∣descend to call at our cottage, sir; as to stockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, sometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the sheep may drop when they rub them∣selves, as they are apt to do, in the bushes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece of frugal industry is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the shepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the scriptures.</NOTE> These scat∣tered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which, I see, have torn sad holes in Molly's apron to∣day; they carry this wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for she can sit and card in the chimney corner, when she is not able to wash, or work about house. The biggest, girl then spins it; it does very well for us, without dye∣ing, for poor people must not stand for the colour of
<PB N="11" REF="035296_0010_1001BFACE0960698"/>their stockings. After this our little boys knit it for themselves, while they are employed in keeping crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chief∣ly for sale, which helps to pay our rent.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson lifted up his eyes in silent astonishment at the shifts which honest poverty can make rather than beg or steal, and was surprised to think how many ways of subsisting there are which those who live at their ease little suspect. He secretly resolved to be more attentive to his own petty expenses than he had hither∣to been, and to be more watchful that nothing was wast∣ed in his family.</P>
<P>But to return to the shepherd. Mr. Johnson told him, that as he must needs be at his friend's house, who lived many miles off, that night, he could not, as he wished to do, make a visit to his cottage at present.—But I will certainly do it, said he, on my return, for I long to see your w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and her nice little family, and to be an eye-witness of her neatness and good manage∣ment. The poor man's tears started into his eyes on hearing the commendation bestowed on his wife; and wiping them off with the sleeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handkerchief in the world, he said—Oh! sir, you just now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. Johnson, I hope not—Pride is a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> sin, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, so good a man as you seem to be, ought to guard against it, Sir, said he, you are right but I am not proud of myself, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor sinner, but, indeed, sir, I am proud of my wife:—She is not only the most tidy, notable woman on the Plain, but she is the kindest wife and mother, and the most contented, thankful christian that I know. Last year I thought I should have lost her in a violent fit of the rheumatism, caught by going to work too soon af∣ter
<PB N="12" REF="035296_0011_1001BFAF32171308"/>her lying in, I fear; for it is but a bleak coldish place, as you may see, sir, in winter, and sometimes the snow lies so long under the hill, that I can hardly make myself a path to get out and buy a few necessaries in the next village; and we are afraid to send out the children, for fear they should be lost when the snow is deep. So, as I was saying, the poor soul was very bad indeed, and for several weeks lost the use of all her limbs except her hands: a merciful Providence spared her the use of these, so that when she could not turn in her bed, she could contrive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always saying, had it not been for the great goodness of God, she might have had the palsy instead of the rheu∣matism, and then she could have done nothing—but nobody had so many mercies as she had.</P>
<P>I will not tell you what we suffered during that bit∣ter weather, sir, but my wife's faith and patience dur∣ing that trying time, were as good a lesson to me as any sermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my spirits.</P>
<P>One Sunday afternoon, when my wife was at the worst, as I was coming out of church, for I went one part of the day, and my eldest daughter the other, so my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of church, I say, Mr. Jenkins, the minister, called out to me, and asked me how my wife did, saying, he had been kept from coming to see her by the deep fall of snow, and, indeed, from the parsonage-house to my hovel it was quite impassable. I gave him all the particulars he asked, and, I am afraid, a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a shilling, and said, he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and see her in a day or two.</P>
<P>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking gentleman in boots, who stood by, listening to all I said, but seemed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to pass the Christmas ho∣lidays
<PB N="13" REF="035296_0012_1001BFB44849F6A8"/>at the parsonage house. I had always heard him spoken of as a plain frugal man, who lived close himself, but was remarked to give away more than any of his show-away neighbors.</P>
<P>Well! I went home with great spirits at this season∣able and unexpected supply; for we had tapped our last sixpence, and there was little work to be had on ac∣count of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty-handed. No, I dare say not, says she, you have been serving a master "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he sendeth the rich empty a∣way." True, Mary, says I; we seldom fail to get good spiritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to-day he has kind∣ly supplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I showed her the shilling, than, I dare say, some of your great people are when they get a hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson's heart smote him when he heard such a value set upon a shilling; surely, said he to himself, I will never waste another; but he said nothing to die shepherd, who thus pursued his story.</P>
<P>Next morning before I went out, I sent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown sugar to put into her water-gruel, which you know, sir, made it nice and nourishing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm-yard, for there was no standing out on the plain, after such a snow as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than usual, because I had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t my poor wife a lit∣tle better; and comfortably supplied for this day, and I now resolved more than ever to trust in God for the supplies of the next. When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as soon as she saw me. This I own I thought but a bad return for the blessings she had so lately received, and so I told her. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said she, it is too much, we are too rich, I am now frightened, not lest we should have no portion in this world, but for fear we should have our whole portion in it. Look here,
<PB N="14" REF="035296_0013_1001A30610126528"/>John! So saying she uncovered the bed whereon she lay, and shewed two warm, thick, new blankets. I could not believe my own eyes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was still more a∣mazed when she put half a crown into my hand, telling me she had had a visit from Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had bestowed all these good things upon us. Thus, sir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to these comforts; for the rheumatism, sir, without blankets by night and flan∣nel by day, is but a baddish job, especially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly bo∣dy; but, thank God, her soul prospers, and is in health. But I beg your pardon, sir, for talking on at this rate.—Not at all, not at all, said Mr. Johnson, I am much pleased with your story, you shall certainly see me in a few days. Good night. So saying, he slipped a crown into his hand and rode off. Surely, said the shepherd, <HI>goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</HI> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Johnson he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the rest of his journey. On the whole he was more disposed to envy than to pity the shepherd. I have seldom seen, said he, so happy a man. It is a sort of happiness which the world could not give, and which, I plainly see, it has not been able to take a∣way. This must be the true spirit of religion. I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more and more, that true goodness is not merely a thing of words and opinions, but a living principle brought into every common action of a man's life. What else could have supported this poor couple under every bit∣ter trial of want and sickness? No, my honest shepherd, I do not pity, but I respect and even honor thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I will visit thy poor hovel, on my r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urn to Salisbury with
<PB N="15" REF="035296_0014_1001BFBFD4EADBC0"/>as much pleasure as I am now going to the house of my friend.</P>
<P>If Mr. Johnson keeps his word in sending me the ac∣count of his visit to the shepherd's cottage. I shall be very glad to entertain my readers with it, and shall con∣clude this first part with</P>

<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM willing to hope that my readers will not be sorry to hear some farther particulars of their old acquaint∣ance <HI>the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.</HI> They will call to mind that at the end of the first part, he was return∣ing home full of gratitude for the favors he had receiv∣ed from Mr. Johnson, whom we left pursuing his jour∣ney, after having promised to make a visit to the shep∣herd's cottage.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson, after having passed some time with his friends, sat out on his return to Salisbury, and on the Saturday evening reached a very small inn, a mile or two distant from the shepherd's village; for he never travelled on a Sunday. He went the next morning to the church nearest the house, where he had passed the night; and after taking such refreshment as he could g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at that house, he walked on to find out the shep∣herd's cottage. His reason for visiting him on a Sun∣day was chiefly, because he supposed it to be the only day which the shepherd's employment allowed him to pass at home with his family, and as Mr. Johnson had been struck with his talk, he thought it would be nei∣ther unpleasant nor unprofitable to observe how a man, who carried such an appearance of piety, spent his Sun∣day; for though he was so low in the world, this gen∣tleman
<PB N="17" REF="035296_0016_1001BFD20FA45948"/>was not above entering very closely into his cha∣racter, of which he thought he should be able to form a better judgment, by seeing whether his practice at home kept pace with his professions abroad: for it is not so much by observing how people talk, as how they live, that we ought to judge of their characters.</P>
<P>After a pleasant walk Mr. Johnson got within sight of the cottage, to which he was directed by the clump of hawthorns and the broken chimney. He wished to take the family by surprise; and walking gently up to the house he stood awhile to listen. The door being half open, he saw the shepherd, (who looked so respec∣table in his Sunday coat, that he should hardly have known him) his wife, and their numerous young fami∣ly, draw round their little table, which was covered with a clean though very coarse cloth. There stood on it a large dish of potatoes, a brown pitcher, and a piece of coarse loaf. The wife and children stood in silent at∣tention, while the shepherd, with uplifted hands and eyes, devoutly begged the blessing of heaven on their homely fare. Mr. Johnson could not help sighing to reflect, that he had sometimes seen better dinners eaten with less appearance of thankfulness.</P>
<P>The shepherd and his wife then sat down with great seeming cheerfulness, but the children stood; and while the mother was helping them, little fresh-coloured Mol∣ly, who had picked the wool from the bushes with so much delight, cried out, "Father, I wish I was big e∣nough to say grace, I am sure I should say it very heart∣ily to-day, for I was thinking what must <HI>poor</HI> people do who have no salt to their potatoes, and do but look our dish is quite full."—"This is the true way of thinking, Molly," said the father, "in whatever concerns bodily wants, and bodily comforts, it is our duty to compare our own lot with the lot of those who are worse off, and this will keep us thankful. On the other hand, when∣ever we are tempted to set up our own wisdom or good∣ness,
<PB N="18" REF="035296_0017_1001BFD676BFBF40"/>we must compare ourselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those who are wiser and better, and that will keep u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ble." Mol∣ly was now so hungry, and found the potatoes so good, that she had no time to make any more remarks; but was devouring her dinner very heartily, when the bark∣ing of the great dog drew her attention from her tren∣cher to the door, and spying the stranger, she cried out, "Look father, see here, if yonder is not the good gen∣tleman!" Mr. Johnson finding himself discovered, im∣mediately walked in, and was heartily welcomed by the honest shepherd, who told his wife that this was the gen∣tleman to whom they were so much obliged.</P>
<P>The good woman began, as some very neat people are rather too apt to do, with making many apologies that her house was not cleaner, and that things was not in fitter order to receive such a gentleman. Mr. Johnson, how∣ever, on looking round, could discover nothing but the most perfect neatness. The trenchers on which they were eating were almost as white as their linen; and, notwithstanding the number and smallness of the chil∣dren, there was not the least appearance of dirt or litter. The furniture was very simple and poor, hardly indeed amounting to bare necessaries. It consisted of four brown wooden chairs, which, by constant rubbing, were be∣come as bright as a looking-glass; an iron pot and ket∣tle; a poor old grate which scarcely held a handful of coals, and out of which the little fire that had been in it appeared to have been taken, as soon as it had answered the end for which it had been lighted, that of boiling their potatoes. Over the chimney stood an old fashion∣ed broad bright candlestick, and a still brighter spit; it was pretty clear that this last was kept rather for orna∣ment than use. An old carved elbow chair, and a chest of the same date, which stood in the corner, were con∣sidered as the most valuable part of the shepherd's goods, having been in his family for three generations. But all these were lightly esteemed by him, in comparison of a∣nother
<PB N="19" REF="035296_0018_1001BFDA9175C9A0"/>possession, which added to the above, made up the whole of what he had inherited from his father; and which last he would not have parted with, if no other could have been had, for a king's ransom: this was a large old Bible, which lay on the wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w seat, neatly covered with brown cloth, variously pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed. This sa∣cred book was most reverendly preserved from dog'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ears, dirt, and every other injury, but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch as time and muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use had made it suffer, in spite of care. On the clean white walls were pasted a hymn on the crucifix∣ion of our Saviour, a print of the prodigal son, the shep∣herd's hymn, and a <HI>New History of a True Book.</HI></P>
<P>After the first salutations were over, Mr. Johnson said, that if they would go on quietly with their dinner he would sit down. Though a good deal ashamed, they thought it more respectful to obey the gentleman, who having cast his eye on their slender provitions, gently re∣baked the shepherd for not having indulged himself, as it was Sunday, with a morsel of bacon to relish his po∣tatoes. The shepherd said nothing, but poor Mary co∣loured and hung down her head, saying, "indeed, sir, it is not my fault, I did beg my husband to allow himself a bit of meat to-day out of your honor's bounty; but he was too good to do it, and it is all for my sake."—The shepherd seemed unwilling to come to an explana∣tion, but Mr. Johnson desired Mary to go on. So she continued, "you must know, sir, that both of us, next to a sin, dread a debt, and indeed, in some cases, a debt is a sin; but with all our care and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins we have never been able quite to pay off the doctor's bill, for that bad fit of the rheumatism which I had last winter. Now when you were pleased to give my husband that kind present the other day, I heartily desired him to buy a bit of meat for Sunday, as I said before, that he might have a little ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eshment for himself out of your kindness.—But answered he, Mary, it is never out of my mind long together that we still owe a few shillings to the doctor,
<PB N="20" REF="035296_0019_1001BFDC173E8FC0"/>(and thank God it is all we did owe in the world.)—Now if I carry him this money directly, it will not on∣ly shew him our honesty and our good will, but it will be an encouragement to him to come to you another time in case you should be taken once more in such a bad sit; for I must own, added my poor husband, that the thought of your being so terribly ill without any help, is the only misfortune that I want courage to face."</P>
<P>Here the grateful woman's tears ran down so fast that she could not go on. She wiped them with the corner of her apron, and humbly begged pardon for making so free. "Indeed, sir," said the shepherd, "tho' my wife is full as unwilling to be in debt as myself, yet I could hardly prevail on her to consent to my paying this money just then, because, she said, it was hard I should not have a taste of the gentleman's bounty my∣self. But for once, sir, I would have my own way.—For you must know, as I pass best part of my time a∣lone, tending my sheep, 'tis a great point with me, sir, to get comfortable matter for my own thoughts; so that 'tis rather self-interest in me to allow myself no pleasures and no practices that won't bear thinking on over and over. For when one is a good deal alone, you know sir, all one's bad deeds do so rush in upon one, as I may say, and so torment one, that there is no true comfort to be had but in keeping clear of wrong doings, and false pleasures; and that I suppose may be one reason why so many folks hate to stay a bit by themselves. But as I was saying, when I came to think the matter over on the hill yonder, said I to myself, a good dinner is a good thing I grant, and yet it will be but cold comfort to me a week after, to be able to say—to be sure I had a nice shoulder of mutton last Sun∣day for dinner, thanks to the good gentleman, but then I am in debt—I <HI>had</HI> a rare dinner, that's certain, but the pleasure of that has long been over, and the debt still remains—I have spent the crown, and now if my poor wife should be taken in one of those fits again, die
<PB N="21" REF="035296_0020_1001BFE34691B788"/>she must, unless God work a miracle to prevent it, for I can get no help for her. This thought settled all; and I set off directly and paid the crown to the doctor with as mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h cheerfulness as I should have felt on sitting down to the fattest shoulder of mutton that ever was roasted. And if I was contented at the time, think how much more happy I have been at the remembrance! O sir, there are no pleasures worth the name but such as bring no plague or penitence after them."</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson was satisfied with the shepherd's rea∣sons; and agreed, that though a good dinner was not to be despised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it was not worthy to be compared with <HI>a contented mind, which</HI> (as the Bible truly says) <HI>is a continual feast."</HI> "But come," said the good gen∣tleman, "what have we got in this brown mug?"—"As good water," said the shepherd, "as any in the king's dominions. I have heard of countries beyond sea in which there is no wholesome water; nay, I have been myself in a great town not far off where they are obliged to buy all the water they get, while a good Pro∣vidence sends to my very door a spring as clear and fine as Jacob's well. When I am tempted to repine that I have often no other drink, I call to mind, that it was nothing better than a cup of cold water which the wo∣man of Samaria drew for the greatest guest that ever vi∣sited this world."</P>
<P>"Very well," replied Mr. Johnson; "but as your honesty has made you prefer a poor meal to being in debt, I will at least s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd and get something for you to drink. I saw a little public house just by the church, as I came along. Let that little rosy-faced fellow fetch a mug of beer."</P>
<P>So saying he looked full at the boy, who did not of∣fer to stir; but cast an eye at his father to know what he was to do. "Sir," said the shepherd, "I hope we shall not appear ungrateful if we seem to refuse your fa∣vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my little boy would, I am sure, fly to serve you
<PB N="22" REF="035296_0021_1001BFE85A59F8C0"/>on any other occasion. But, good sir, it is Sunday, and should any of my family be seen at a public house on a Sabbath-day, it would be a much greater grief to me than to drink water all my life. I am often talking a∣gainst these doings to others, and if I should say one thing and do another, you can't think what an advan∣tage it would give many of my neighbors over me, who would be glad enough to report that they caught the shepherd's son at the ale-house, without explaining how it happened. Christians, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, must be doubly watchful, or they will not only bring disgrace on them∣selves, but what is much worse, on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly name by which they are called."</P>
<P>"Are you not a little too cautious, my honest friend?" said Mr. Johnson. "I humbly ask your pardon, sir," replied the shepherd, "if I think that is impossible. In my poor notion I no more understand how a man can be too cautious, than how he can be too strong, or too healthy."</P>
<P>"You are right, indeed," said Mr. Johnson, "as a general principle, but this struck me as a very small thing." "Sir," said the shepherd, "I am afraid you will think me very bold, but you encourage me to speak out." "'Tis what I wish," said the gentleman.—"Then, sir," resumed the shepherd, "I doubt if, where there is a temptation to do wrong, any thing can be called small; that is, in short, if there is any such thing as a small wilful sin. A poor man, like me, is seldom called out to do great things, so that it is not by a few great deeds his character can be judged by his neighbors, but by the little round of daily customs he allows himself in."—While they were thus talking, the children, who had stood very quietly behind, and had not stirred a foot, now began to scamper about all at once, and in a moment r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to the window-seat to pick up their little old hats. Mr. Johnson looked surprized at this disturbance; the shepherd asked his pardon, tell∣ing
<PB N="23" REF="035296_0022_1001BFEF0FBD30A8"/>him it was the sound of the church bell which had been the cause of their rudeness: for their mother had brought them up with such fear of being too late for church, that it was but who could catch the first stroke of the bell, and be first ready. He had always taught them to think that nothing was more indecent than to get into church after it was begun; for as the service opened with an exhortation to repentance, and a con∣fession of sin, it looked very presumptuous not to be ready to join in it—it looked as if people did not feel themselves to be sinners. And though such as lived at a great distan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might plead difference of clocks as an excuse, yet those who lived within the sound of the bell, could pretend neither ignorance nor mistake.</P>
<P>Mary and her children set forward. Mr. Johnson and the shepherd followed, taking care to talk the whole way on such subjects as might fit them for the solemn duties of the place to which they were going. "I have often been sorry to observe," said Mr. Johnson, "that many who are reckoned decent, good kind of people, and who would on no account neglect going to church, yet seem to care but little in what frame or temper of mind they go thither. They will talk of their worldly concerns till they get within the door, and then take them up again the very minute the sermon is over, which makes me ready to fear they lay too much stress on the mere form of going to a place of worship. Now, for my part, I always find that it requires a little time to bring my mind into a state fit to do any <HI>common</HI> bu∣siness well, much more this great and most necessary business of all." "Yes sir," said the shepherd, "and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en I think too how busy I should be in preparing my mind, if I was going into the presence of a great gen∣tleman, or a lord, or the king; and shall the King of Kings be treated with less respect? Besides one likes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sce people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel as if going to church was a thing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oice and pleasure, as well as a duty, and that they
<PB N="24" REF="035296_0023_1001BFF496F37918"/>were as desirous not to be the last there, as they would be if they were going to a feast or a fair."</P>
<P>After service, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman, who was well acquanted with the character of Mr. Johnson, and had a great respect for him, accosted him with much ci∣vility; expressing his concern that he could not enjoy just now so much of his conversation as he wished, as he was obliged to visit a person at a distance, but hoped to have a little talk with him before he left the village.—As they walked along together, Mr. Johnson made such enquiries about the shepherd, as served to confirm him in the high opinion he entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his piety, good sense, industry, and self-denial. They parted, the cler∣gyman promising to call in at the cottage in his way home.</P>
<P>The shepherd, who took it for granted that Mr. John∣son was gone to the parsonage, walked home with his wife and children, and was begining in his usual way to catechise and instruct his family, when Mr. Johnson came in, and insisted that the shepherd should go on with his instructions, just as if he were not there.—This gentleman, who was very desirous of being useful to his own servants and workmen in the way of reli∣gious instruction, was sometimes sorry to find that tho' he took a good deal of pains, they did not now and then quite understand him, for though his meaning was very good, the language was not always very plain; and though the <HI>things</HI> he said were not hard to be under∣stood, yet the <HI>words</HI> were, especially to such as were very ignorant. And he now began to find out, that if people were ever so wise and good, yet if they had not a simple, agreeable, and familiar way of expressing them∣selves, some of their plain hearers would not be much the better for them. For this reason he was not above li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tening to the plain humble way in which this honest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n caught his family, for though he knew that he him∣self had many advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages over the shepherd, had more
<PB N="25" REF="035296_0024_1001BFF7674E2DF8"/>learning, and could teach him many things, yet he was not too proud to learn even of so poor a man, in any point where he thought the shepherd might have the ad∣vantage of him.</P>
<P>This gentleman was much pleased with the know∣ledge and piety he discovered in the answers of the children; and desired the shepherd to tell him how he contrived to keep a sense of divine things in his own mind and in that of his family with so little leisure and so little reading. "O as to that, sir," said the shepherd, "we do not read much except in one book to be sure; but by hearty prayer for God's blessing on the use of that book, what little knowledge is needful seems to come of course, as it were. And my chief study has been to bring the fruits of the Sunday reading into the week's business, and to keep up the same sense of God in the heart, when the bible is in the cupboard as when it is in the hand. In short to apply what I read in the book, to what I meet with in the field."</P>
<P>"I don't quite understand you," said Mr. Johnson, "Sir," replied the shepherd, "I have but a poor gift at conveying these things to others, though I have much comfort from them in my own mind; but I am sure that the most ignorant and hard working people, who are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnest about their salvation, may help to keep up de∣vout thoughts and good affections during the week, though they have harely any time to look at a book.—And it will help them to keep out bad thoughts too, which is no small matter. But then they must know the Bible; they must have read the word of God; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and of stock in trade for a christian to set up with; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd it is this which makes me so diligent in teaching it to my children: and even in storing their memories with psalms and chapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. This is a great help to a poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard-working man, who will hardly meet with any thing but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he may turn to some good account. If o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r and love of God, almost every thing
<PB N="26" REF="035296_0025_1001BFFBB95FD5F0"/>one sees abroad will teach one to adore his power and goodness, and bring to mind some texts of scripture, which shall fill the heart with thankfulness, and the mouth with praise. When I look upwards <HI>the hea∣vens declare the glory of God;</HI> and shall I be silent and ungrateful? if I look round and see the vallies standing thick with corn, how can I help blessing that Power, who <HI>giveth me all things richly to enjoy?</HI> I may learn gratitude from the beasts of the field, for the <HI>ox know∣eth his owner, and the ass his master's crib,</HI> and shall a christian not know, shall a christian not consider, what great things God has done for him? I, who am a shep∣herd, endeavor to fill my soul with a constant remem∣brance of that good shepherd, who <HI>feedeth me in green pastures, and maketh me to lie down beside the still wa∣ters, and whose rod and staff comfort me.</HI>"</P>
<P>"You are happy," said Mr. Johnson, "in this reti∣red life by which you escape the corruptions of the world." "Sir," said the shepherd, "I do not escape the corruptions of my own evil nature. Even there on that wild solitary hill, I can find out that my heart is prone to evil thoughts. I suppose, sir, that different states have different temptations. You great folks that live in the world, perhaps are exposed to some, of which such a poor man as I am, know nothing. But to one who leads a lonely life like me, evil thoughts are a chief besetting sin; and I can no more withstand these with∣out the grace of God, than a rich gentleman can with∣stand the snares of evil company, without the same grace. And I feel that I stand in need of God's help continually, and if he should give me up to my own evil heart I should be lost."</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson approved of the shepherd's sincerity, for he had always observed that where there was no hu∣mility, and no watchfulness against sin, there was no re∣ligion, and he said that the man who did not feel him∣self to be a sinner in his opinion, could not be a chris∣tian.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="035296_0026_1001BFFE1F9870A0"/>
Just as they were in this part of their discourse, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman came in. After the usual salu∣tations, he said, "Well Shepherd, I wish you joy; I know you will be sorry to gain any advantage by the death of a neighbor; but old Wilson my clerk, was so infirm, and I trust so well prepared, that there is no rea∣son to be sorry for his death. I have been to pray by him, but he died while I staid. I have always intended you should succeed to his place; 'tis no great matter, but every little is something."</P>
<P>"No great matter, sir," cried the shepherd, "in∣deed it is a great thing to me; it will more than pay my rent. Blessed be God for all his goodness." Mary said nothing, but lifted up her eyes full of tears in silent gratitude.</P>
<P>"I am glad of this little circumstance," said Mr. Jenkins, "not only for your sake, but for the sake of the office itself. I so heartily reverence every religious institution, that I would never have even the <HI>Amen</HI> added to the excellent prayers of our church, by vain or profane lips, and if it depended on me, there should be no such thing in the land as an idle, drunken, or irre∣ligious parish clerk. Sorry I am to say, that this mat∣ter is not always sufficiently attended to, and that I know some of a very different character."</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson now inquired of the clergyman, whe∣ther there were many children in the parish. "More than you would expect," replied he "from the seem∣ing smallness of it, but there are some little hamlets which you do not see." "I think," returned Mr. John∣son, "I recollect that in the conversation I had with the shepherd on the hill yonder, he told me you had no Sunday school." "I am sorry to say we have none," said the minister; "I do what I can to remedy this misfortune by public chatechising; but having two or three churches to serve, I cannot give so much time as I wish to private instruction; and having a large fami∣ly
<PB N="28" REF="035296_0027_1001C0095BFB2988"/>of my own, and no assistance from others, I have ne∣ver been able to establish a school."</P>
<P>"There is an excellent institution in London," said Mr. Johnson, "called the Sunday-School Society, which kindly gives books and other helps, on the application of such pious ministers as stand in need of their aid, and which I am sure would have assisted you, but I think we shall be able to do something ourselves.—Shepherd," continued he, "if I was a king, and had it in my power to make you a rich and a great man, with a word speaking, I would not do it. Those who are raised by some sudden stroke, much above the station in which divine Providence had placed them, seldom turn out very good, or very happy. I have never had any great things in my power, but as far as I have been able, I have been always glad to assist the worthy, I have however never attempted or desired to set any poor man much above his natural condition, but it is a pleasure to me to lend him such assistance as may make that condi∣tion more easy to himself, and to put him in a way which shall call him to the performance of more duties than perhaps he could have performed without my help, and of performing them in a better manner.—What rent do you pay for this cottage?"</P>
<P>"Fifty shillings a year, sir.</P>
<P>"It is in a sad tattered condition, is there not a bet∣ter to be had in the village?"</P>
<P>"That in which the poor clerk lived," said the cler∣gyman, "is not only more tight and whole, but has two decent chambers, and a very large light kitchen." "That will be very convenient," replied Mr. Johnson, "pray what is the rent?" "I think," said the shep∣herd, "poor neighbor Wilson gave somewhat about four pounds a year, or it might be guineas."—"Very well," said Mr. Johnson, "and what will the clerk's place be worth, think you?" "About three pounds," was the answer.</P>

"Now," continued Mr. Johnson, "my plan is, that the shepherd should take that house immediately; for as the poor man is dead, there will be no need of wait∣ing till quarter-day, if I make up the difference."—"True, sir," said Mr. Jenkins, "and I am sure my wife's father, whom I expect to-morrow, will willingly assist a little towards buying some of the clerk's old goods; and the sooner they remove the better, for poor Mary caught that bad rheumatism by sleeping under a leaky thatch." The shepherd was too much moved to speak, and Mary could hardly sob out, "Oh, sir, you are too good, indeed this house will do very well," "It may do very well for you and your children Mary," said Mr. Johnson, gravely, "but it will not do for a school; the kitchen is neither large nor light enough. Shepherd," continued he, "with your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od minister's leave, and kind assistance, I propose to set up in this parish a Sunday school, and to make you the master. It will not at all interfere with your weekly calling, and it is the only lawful way in which you could turn the Sab∣bath into a day of some little profit to your family, by doing, as I hope, a great deal of good to the souls of o∣thers. The rest of the week you will work as usual.—The difference of rent between this house and the clerk's I shall pay myself, for to put you into a better house at your own expense would be no great act of kindness. As for honest Mary, who is not fit for hard labor, or any out-of-door work, I propose to endow a small week∣ly school, of which she shall be the mistress, and employ her notable turn to good account, by teaching ten or a dozen of girls to knit, sew, spin, card, or any other use∣ful way of getting their bread; for all this I shall only pay her the usual price, for I am not going to make you rich but useful."</P>
<P>"Not rich, sir?" cried the shepherd. "How can I ever be thankful enough for such blessings? And will my poor Mary have a dry thatch over her head? And
<PB N="30" REF="035296_0029_1001C0164BCBE1D8"/>shall I be able to send for the doctor when I am like to lose her? Indeed my cup runs over with blessings, I hope God will give me humility." Here he and Mary looked at each other and burst into tears. The gentle∣man saw their distress, and kindly walked out upon the little green before the door, that these honest people might give vent to their feelings. As soon as they were alone, they crept into one corner of the room, where they thought they could not be seen, and fell on their knees, devoutly blessing and praising God for his mer∣cies. Never were heartier prayers presented, than this grateful couple offered up for their benefactors. The warmth of their gratitude could only be equalled by the earnestness with which they besought the blessing of God on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rk in which they were going to engage.</P>
<P>The two gentlemen now l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft this happy family, and walked to the parsonage, where the evening was spent in a manner very edifying to Mr. Johnson, who, the next day, took all proper measures for putting the shep∣herd in immediate possession of his now comfortable ha∣bitation. Mr. Jenkins's father-in-law, the worthy gen∣tleman who gave the shepherd's wife the blanket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in the first part of this history, arrived at the parsonage be∣fore Mr. Johnson lest it, and assisted in fitting up the clerk's cottage.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson took his leave, promising to call on the worthy minister and his new clerk once a year, in his summer's journey over the plain, as long as it should please God to spare his life.—We hope he will never fail to give us an account of these visits, which we shall be glad to lay before our readers, if they should contain instruction or amusement.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>TOM WHITE,</HI> THE POSTILION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE, was one of the best drivers of a post-chaise on the Bath road.—Tom was the son of an honest laborer at a little village in Wiltshire: he was an active industrious boy, and as soon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous family, and went to live with Farmer Hod∣ges, a sober worthy man in the same village. He drove the waggon all the week, and on Sundays, though he was now grown up, the farmer required him to attend the Sunday school, carried on under the inspection of Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, and always made him read his Bible in the evening, after he had served his beasts, and would have turned him out of his service if he had even gone to the alchouse for his own pleasure.</P>
<P>Tom, by earring some waggon-loads of faggots to the Bear Inn at Devizes, soon made many acquaintan∣ces in the stable-yard. He compared his own cotter's frock, and shoes thick set with nails, with the smart red j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cket and tight boots of the post-boys, and grew a∣sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l of his own homely dress; he was resolved to drive a chaise, to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t money, and to see the world.—
<PB N="32" REF="035296_0031_1001C01AA4C642C8"/>Foolish fellow! he never considered, that, though it is true, a waggoner works hard all day, yet he gets a qui∣et evening, and undisturbed rest at night. However as there must he chaise-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it exposed him, was the chief mischief. He left farmer Hodges though not without sorrow at quit∣ting so kind a master, and got himself hired at the Black Bear.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the temptations to which he was now exposed, Tom's good education stood by him for some time. At first he was frightened to hear the oaths and wicked words which are too often uttered in a sta∣ble-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the courage to reprove it, and the next stop to being easy at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eing others sin, is to sin ourselves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a mark of spi∣rit in others to swear; though the force of good habit was so strong, that at first when he swore himself it was with sear and in a low voice. But he was soon laughed out of his sheepishness, as they called it; and though he never became so prophane and blasphemous as some of his companions, (for he never swore in cool blood or in mirth as so many do,) yet he would too often use a dreadful bad word when he was in a passion with his horses. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedness of being in a great rage with poor beasts, who not having the gift of reason, cannot be moved like human creatures, with all the wicked words that are said to them; but who unhappily ha∣ving the gift of feeling, suffer as much as human crea∣tures can do, at the cruel and unnecessary beatings given them. He had been bred up to think that drunken∣ness was a great sin, for he never saw farmer Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is sober, his men are less likely to drink, or if they do, the master can re∣prove them with the better grace.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="035296_0032_1001C01EC5E8CD58"/>
Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the sake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been used to go to church twice on a Sunday whole he lived with the farmer, who seldom used his horses on that day except to carry his wife to church behind him, Tom felt a little uneasy when he was sent the very first Sunday a long journey with a great family; for I can∣not conceal the truth, that too many gentlefolks will travel when there is no necessity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would answer the end just as well. This is a great grief to all good and sober people, both rich and poor. However he kept his thoughts to him∣self, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, whose waggoner on a Sunday led as easy a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he soon lost all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on prosperously, as it is called, for three or four years, got plenty of money, but saved not a shil∣ling. As soon as his horses were once in the stable, whoever would might see them fed for Tom.—He had other fish to fry.—Fives, cards, cudgel playing, laying wagers, and keeping loose company, each of which he at first disliked, and then practised, ran away with all his money, and all his spare time; and though he was generally in the way as soon as the horses were ready, (because if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the horses looked well, if the harness was whole, or the hor∣ses were shod. The certainty that the gains of to-mor∣row would make up for the extravagance of to-day, made him quite thoughtless and happy, for he was young, active, and healthy, and never foresaw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now squan∣dered away.</P>
<P>One day being a little flustered with liquor as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was
<PB N="34" REF="035296_0033_1001A32C1DA4CA78"/>driving his return chaise through Brentford, he saw just before him another empty carriage, driven by one of his acquaintances: he whipped up his horses, resolving to outstrip the other, and swearing dreadfully that he would be at the Red Lyon first—for a pint—done, cried the other—a wager.—Both cut and spurred the poor beasts with the usual fury, as if their credit had been really at stake, or their lives had depended on this fool∣ish contest. Tom's chaise had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along-side of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But, in a narrow part, Tom's chaise being in the middle, with his antag∣onist on one side, and a cart driving against him on the other, the horses reared, the carriages got entangled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to stop, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> either could not, or would not do, but returned a hor∣rid imprecation that he would win the wager if he was alive. Tom's horses took fright, and he was thrown to the ground with great violence. As soon as he could be got from under the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, he was taken up s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se∣less; his leg was broke in two places, and his body much bruised. Some people whom the noise had bro't together, put him into the post-chaise, in which the wag∣goner kindly assisted, but the other driver seemed care∣less and indifferent, and drove off, observing with a bru∣tal coolness, "I am sorry I have lost my pint; I should have beat him hollow, had it not been for this <HI>little ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>at.</HI>" Some gentlemen who came out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, af∣ter reprimanding this savage, inquired who he was, wrote to inform his master, and got hun discharged: resolving that neither they, nor any of their friends, would ever employ him, and he was long out of place.</P>
<P>Tom was taken to one of those excellent hospitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dread∣ful, his leg was set, and a high fever came on. As soon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his first thought was that he should die, and his horror was in∣conceivable.—"Alas!"
<PB N="35" REF="035296_0034_1001C02C6488E7C0"/>said he, "what will become of my poor soul? I am cut off in the very commission of three great sins:—I was dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, I was in a horrible passion, and I had oaths and blasphemies in my mouth."—He tried to pray, but he could not, his mind was all distraction, and he thought he was so very wicked that God would not forgive him: "because," says he, "I have sinned against light and knowledge, and a sober e∣ducation, and good examples, and I deserve nothing but punishment."—At length he grew light-headed, and there was little hopes of his life. Whenever he came to his senses for a few minutes, he cried out, "O that my old companions could now see me, surely they would take warning by my sad sate, and repent before it is too late."</P>
<P>By the blessing of God, on the skill of the surgeon, and the care of the nurses, he however grew better in a few days. And here let me stop to remark, what a mer∣cy it is that we live in a christian country, where the poor, when sick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry; nay, in some respects, more, because in hospitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and surgeons to attend, than most private gentle-folks can afford to have at their own houses, whereas <HI>there never was an hospital in the whole heathen world.</HI> Blessed be God for this, among the thousand other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION!</P>
<P>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed. This was a happy affliction; for this long sick∣ness and solitude gave him time to reflect on his past life. He began seriously to hate those darling si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s which had brought him to the brink of ruin. He could now pray heartily; he confessed and lamented his iniquities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be extended to him on his sincere repentance. He resolved never more to return to the same evil courses, but he
<PB N="36" REF="035296_0035_1001C032C85291C8"/>did not trust in his own strength, but prayed that God would give him grace for the future, as well as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> for the past. He remembered, and he was hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the thought, that he used to have short fits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and to form resolutions of amendment, in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d thoughtless days, and often when he had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ache after a drinking bout, or had lost his money a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l-fours, he vowed never to drink or play again. But as soon as his head was well or his pockets recruited, he forgot all his resolutions. And how should it be otherwise? for he trusted in his own strength, he never prayed to God to strengthen him, nor even avoided the next tempta∣tion.</P>
<P>The case was now different. Tom began to find that <HI>his strength was perfect weakness,</HI> and that he could do nothing without the divine assistance, for which he pray∣ed heartily and constantly. He sent home for his Bible, and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday school. He spent the chief part of his time in reading them, and thus derived great comfort, as well as great knowledge. The study of the Bible filled his heart with gratitude to God, who had not cut him off in the midst of his sins, but given him space for repent∣ance; and the agonies he had lately suffered with his broken leg increased his thankfulness, that he had escap∣ed the more dreadful pain of eternal misery. And here let the remark what encouragement this is for rich peo∣ple to give away Bibles and good books, and not to lose all hope, though for a time they see little or no good effect from it. According to all appearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor, who had cast his bread upon the waters, found it after many days, for this Bible which had lain untouched for years, was at last made the means of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> reformation. God will work in his own good time.</P>
<P>As soon as he got well, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discharged from the
<PB N="37" REF="035296_0036_1001C0367507F938"/>hospital, Tom began to think he must return to get his bread. At first he had some scruples about going back to his old employ; but, says he, sensibly enough, gen∣tlefolks must travel, travellers must have chaises, and chaises must have drivers; it is a very honest calling, and I don't know that goodness belongs to one sort of business more than another: and he who can be good in a state of great temptation, provided the calling be lawful, and the temptations are not of his own seeking, and he be diligent in prayer, may be better than another man for aught I know; and <HI>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that state of life in which it shall please God to call us.</HI> Tom had rubbed up his catechism at the hospital, and it is a pity that people don't look at their catechism sometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en as it is for chil∣dren; nay, better, for though the answers contained in it are intended for children to <HI>repeat,</HI> yet the duties en∣joined in it are intended for men and women to put in <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>Tom now felt grieved that he was obliged to drive on Sundays. But people who are in earnest, and have their hearts in a thing, can find helps in all cases. As soon as he had set down his company at their stage, and had seen his horses fed, says Tom, "A man who takes care of his horses will generally think it right to let them rest an hour or two at least. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers should be over, I'll try hard for the sermon; and if I dare not stay to the sermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I used to make nothing of making a push, for the sake of getting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to serve God. By this watchfulness he soon got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hours of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vice at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ns on the road he tra∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and while the horses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I can went to church;
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0037_1001C03A9E03F9A8"/>and it became a favorite proverb with him, that <HI>prayers and provender hinder no man's journey.</HI></P>
<P>At first his companions wanted to laugh and make sport of this; but when they saw that no lad on the road was up so early or worked so hard as Tom; when they saw no chaise so neat, no glasses so bright, no har∣ness so tight, no driver so diligent, so clean, or so civil, they found he was no subject to make sport at. Tom indeed was very careful in looking after the linch pine, in never giving his horses too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his haste, would be ever gallop them up hill, strike them across the head, or when tired, cut and slash them in driving on the stones, as soon as he got into a town, as some foolish fellows do. What helped to cure Tom of these bad practices, was that remark he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with in the Bible, that <HI>a good man is merciful to his beast.</HI> He was much moved on reading the prophet Jonah, to observe what compassion the great God of heaven and earth had for poor beasts: for one of the reasons there given, why the Almighty was unwilling to destroy the great city of Ninevah was, <HI>because there was much cattle in it.</HI> After this, Tom never could bear to see a wanton stroke inflicted.</P>
<P>Tom soon grew rich for one in his station; for eve∣ry gentleman on the road would be driven by no other l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> if <HI>careful Tom</HI> was to be had. Being diligent, he <HI>got</HI> a great deal of money; being frugal, he <HI>spent</HI> but little; and having no vices, he <HI>wasted</HI> none. He soon found out that there was some meaning in that text which says, that <HI>Godliness hath the promise of the lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that now is, as well as of that which is to come:</HI> for the same principles which makes a man sober and honest, have also a natural tendency to make him healthy and rich; while a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and a spendthrift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hardly es∣cape being sick, and a beggar in the end. Vice is the parent of misery here as well as hereafter.</P>
<P>After a few years Tom begged a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, and made
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0038_1001C03F806B5C60"/>a visit to his native village: his good character had got thither before him. He found his father was dead, but during his long illness Tom had supplied him with mo∣ney, and by allowing him a trifle every week, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d had the honest satisfaction of keeping him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parish. Farmer Hodges was still living, but being grown old and infirm, he was desirous to retire from business. He retained a great regard for his old servant, Tom; and finding he was worth money, and knowing he knew something of country business, he offered to let him a small farm at an easy rate, and promised his assistance in the management for the first year, with the loan of a small sum of money, that he might set out with a pretty stock. Tom thanked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with tears in his eyes, went back and took a handsome leave of his master, who made him a present of a horse and cart, in acknowledgement of his long and faithful services; for, says he, "I have saved many horses by Tom's care and attention, and I could well afford to do the same by every servant who did the same by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; and should be a richer man at the end o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every year by the same generosity, provided I could meet with just and faithful servants who deserved the same rewards."</P>
<P>Tom was soon settled in his new farm, and in less than a year had got every thing neat and decent about him. Farmer Hodges' long experience and friendly advice, joined to his own industry and hard labor, soon bro't the farm to great perfection. The regularity, sobriety, peaceableness, and piety of his daily life, his constant attendance at church twice every Sunday, and his de∣cent and devout behavior when there, soon recommend∣ed him to the notice of Dr. Shepherd, who was still li∣ving, a pattern of zeal, activity, and benevolence to all parish priests. The Dr. soon begun to hold up Tom, or as we must now more properly ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, Mr. Tho∣mas White, to the imitation of the whole parish, and the frequent and condescending conversation of this
<PB N="40" REF="035296_0039_1001C04344FA17F8"/>worthy clergyman, contributed no less than his preach∣ing to the improvement of his new parishioner.</P>
<P>Farmer White soon found out that a dairy could not well he carried on without a mistress, and beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to think seriously of marrying; he prayed to God to direct him in so important a business. He knew that a taw∣dry, vain, dressy girl, was not likely to make good cheese and butter, and that a worldly and ungodly woman would make a sad wife and mistress of a family. He soon heard of a young woman of excellent character, who had been bred up by the vicar's lady, and still lived in the family as upper maid. She was prudent, sober, in∣dustrious, and religious. Her neat, modest, and plain appearance at church, (for she was seldom seen any where else out of her master's family) was an example to all persons in her station, and never f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled to recommend her to strangers, even before they had an opportunity of knowing the goodness of her character. It was her character, however, which recommended her to farmer White. He knew that <HI>favor is deceitful, and beauty is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, but a woman that feareth the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, she shall be praised:</HI>—"aye, and not only praised, but chosen too," says Farmer White, as he took down his hat from the nail on which it hung, in order to go and wait on Dr. Shepherd, to break his mind and ask his consent; for he thought it would be a very unhandsome return for all the favors he was receiving from his minister, to decoy away his faithful servant from her place without his consent.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman, though sorry to lose so va∣luable a member of his little family, did not scruple a moment about parting with her, when he found it would be so greatly to her advantage. Tom was agreeably sur∣prised to hear she had saved fifty pounds by her frugali∣ty. The doctor married them himself, Farmer Hodges being present.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Dr. Shepherd condescended to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="41" REF="035296_0040_1001A338CC2E1E48"/>on Farmer and Mrs. White, to give a few words of ad∣vice on the new duties they had entered into; a com∣mon custom with him on those occasions. He often took an opportunity to drop, in the most kind and tender way, a hint on the great indecency of making marriages, christenings, and, above all, funerals, days of riot and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss, as is too often the case in country villages.— The expectation that the vicar might possibly drop in, in his walk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on these festivities, sometimes restrained excessive drinking, and improper conversation, even a∣mong those farmers who were not restrained by higher motives, as Farmer and Mrs. White were.</P>
<P>What the doctor said was always in such a cheerful, good-ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noured way, that it was sure to increase the pleasure of the day, instead of damping it. Well, Far∣mer, said he, and you my faithful Sarah, any other friend might recommend peace and agreement to you on your marriage; but I, on the contrary, recommend cares and strifes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dodd's Sayings.</NOTE> The company stared—but Sarah, who knew that her old master was a facetious gentleman, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ways had some good meaning behind, looked serious.— "Cares and strifes, sir, said the farmer, what do you mean?" I mean, said he, for the first, that your cares shall be who shall please God most, and your strifes, who shall serve him best, and do your duty most faithfully. Thus, all your cares and strifes being employed to the highest purposes, all petty cares and worldly strifes shall be at an end,</P>
<P>"Always remember, both of you, that you have still a better friend than each other."—The company stared again, and thought no woman could have so good a friend as nor husband. "As you have chosen each other from
<PB N="42" REF="035296_0041_1001C0494782D230"/>the best motives," continued the doctor, "you have e∣very reasonable ground to hope for happiness; but as this world is a soil, in which troubles and misfortunes will spring up; troubles from which you cannot save one another: then remember, it is the best wisdom to go to that friend who is always near, always willing, and always able to help you, and that friend is God."</P>
<P>"Sir," said Farmer White, "I humbly thank you for all your kind instructions, of which I shall stand more in need than ever, as I shall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my past offences will keep me humble, and the sense of my remaining sin will keep me watchful. I set out in the world, sir, with what is called a good natural disposition, but I soon found, to my cost, that, without God's grace, that will carry a man but a lit∣tle way. A good temper is a good thing, but nothing but the fear of God can enable one to bear up against temp∣tation, evil company and evil passions. The misfortune of breaking my leg, as I then thought it, has proved the greatest blessing of my life. It shewed me my own weak∣ness, sir, the value of the Bible, and the goodness of God. How many of my brother drivers have I seen since that time cut off in the prime of life by drinking, or by some sudden accident, while I have not only been spar∣ed, but blessed and prospered. O, sir! it would be the joy of my heart, if some of my old comrades, good-na∣tured, civil fellows, (whom I can't help loving) could see, as I have done, the danger of evil courses before it is too late. Though they may not hearken to you, sir, or any other <HI>minister,</HI> they may believe <HI>me,</HI> because I have been one of them; and I can speak from experi∣ence, of the great difference there is, even as to worldly comfort, between a life of sobriety and a life of sin. I could tell them, sir, not as a thing I have read in a book, but as a truth I feel in my own heart, that to fear God and keep his commandments, will not only "bring a man peace at the last," but will make him happy <HI>now.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="035296_0042_1001C04B1F22BFB8"/>And I will venture to say, sir, that all the stocks, pillo∣ries, prisons, and gibbets in the land, tho' so very need∣ful to keep bad men in order, yet will never restrain a good man from committing evil, half so much as that single text, "how shall I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" Dr. Shepherd condescended to ap∣prove of what the farmer had said, kindly shook him by the hand, and took leave.</P>
<P>Thomas White had always been fond of singing, but he had for many years despised that vile trash which is too often sung in a stable-yard. One Sunday evening he heard his mistress at the Bear read some verses out of a fine book called the Spectator. He was so struck with the picture it contains of the great mercies of God, of which he had himself partaken so largely, that he took the liberty to ask her for these verses, and she being a very good natured woman, made her daughter write out for the postilion the following</P>

<HEAD>THE WAY TO PLENTY; OR THE SECOND PART OF <HI>TOM WHITE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE, as we have shewn in the first pass of this history, from an idle post-boy was become a respectable farmer. God had blessed has industry, and he had prospered in the world, He was sober and tem∣perate, and, as was the natural consequence, he was ac∣tive and healthy. He was industrious and frugal, and he became prosperous in his circumstances. This is in the ordinary course of providence. But it is not a certain and necessary rule. <HI>God maketh his sun to shine on the just and the unjust.</HI> A man who uses every honest means of thrift and industry, will, in most cases, find success attend his labors. But still the <HI>race is not always to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ift, nor the battle to the strong.</HI> God is sometimes pleased, for wise ends, to disappoint all the worldly hope, of the most upright man. His corn may be smitten by a blight. His barns may be consumed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. His cat∣tle may be carried off by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per. And to these and other mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, he is as liable as the spend thrift or the knave, Success is the <HI>common</HI> reward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> industry, but if it were its <HI>constant</HI> reward, the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rious would be tempted to look no further than the present state. They
<PB N="47" REF="035296_0046_1001C05A5CD09258"/>would lose one strong ground of their faith. It would set aside the scripture scheme. This world would be looked on as a state of reward, instead of a state of trial, and we should forget to look to a day of final retribu∣tion.</P>
<P>Farmer White never took it into his head, that be∣cause he paid his debts, worked early and late, and ate the bread of carefulness, he was therefore to come into no <HI>misfortune like other folk,</HI> but was to be free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that prosperity was far from being a sure mark of God's fa∣vor, and had read in good books, and especially in the Bible, of the great poverty and afflictions of the best of men. Though he was no great scholar, he had sense e∣nough to observe, that a time of public prosperity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he prospered the more he prayed that prosperity might not corrupt his heart. And when he saw lately signs of public distress coming on, he was not half so much frightened as some others were, because he thought it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a lit∣tle penitence. The great grace he labored after was that of a cheerful submission. He used to say, that if the Lord's Prayer had only contained those four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the biggest book in the world without them.</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, (with whom the far∣mer's wife had formerly lived as housekeeper) was very fond of taking a walk with him about his grounds, and used to say, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the doctor happened to ob∣serve, I am afraid these long rains will spoil this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne piece of outs, the farmer would answer, "but then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> how good it is for the grass." If the doctor seat∣ed
<PB N="48" REF="035296_0047_1001C05E66724900"/>sure the rye would turn out well. When grass failed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out some way to justify Providence. "'Tis better," said he "to have our lands a little overflowed, than that the springs should be dried up, and our cattle faint for lack of wa∣ter." When the drought came, he thanked God that the season would be healthy; and high winds, which frightened others, he said served to clear the air. Who∣ever or whatever was wrong, he was always su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that Providence was in the right. And he used to say, that a man with ever so small an income, if he had but fru∣gality and temperance, and cast off all vain desires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetousness. When he saw others in the wrong, he did not however abuse them for it, but took care to a∣void the same fault. He had sense and spirit enough to break through many old but very bad customs of his neighbors. "If a thing is wrong in itself," (said he one day to Farmer Hodges) "a whole parish doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cus∣tom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for be∣ing old, because it has the stamp of ages and the sanc∣tion of experience on its worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another reason for my trying to put an end to it, that we may not mislead our children as our fathers have misled us."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ROOF-RAISING.</HEAD>
<P>Some years after he was settled, he built a large new barn. All the workmen were looking forward to the usual holiday of roof-raising. On this occasion it was a custom to give a dinner to the workmen, with so much liquor after it that they got so drunk that they not only lost the remaining half day's work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035296_0048_1001A34291EF7DE0"/>
Mrs. White provided a plentiful dinner for roof-raising, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamorous for more drink. The farmer said, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the sake of saving my liquor, though that is some consideration; but I ne∣ver will, knowingly, help any man to make a beast of himself. I am resolved to break through a bad custom. You are now well refreshed. If you will go cheerfully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this afternoon were wasted in drunkenness. For this your families will be the better: whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I should help to rob them of their bread. But I wish to shew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all another mug at night, when you leave off.—Thus your time will be saved, your families helped, and my ale will not go to make reasonable creatures worse than brute beasts."</P>
<P>Here he stopped.—"You are in the right on't, mas∣ter," said Tom the thatcher. "You are a hearty man, farmer," said John Plane the carpenter." "Come a∣long, boys," said Tim Brick the mason; so they all went merrily to work, fortified with a good dinner.— There was only one drunken surly fellow who refused, that was Dick Guzzle, the smith. Dick never works above two or three days in the week, and spends the others at the Red Lion. He swore, that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he liked at roof-raising, he would not strike another stroke, but would leave the job unfinished, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of such a sot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almost starving family. When the men came for
<PB N="50" REF="035296_0049_1001C06B9D6880E0"/>their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon: they made a hearty sup∣per, and thanked him for having broke through a fool∣ish custom, which was afterwards much left off in that parish, though Dick would not come into it, and lost most of his work.</P>
<P>Farmer White's laborers were often complaining, that things were so dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not entirely, for it was before these very hard times. One morn∣ing he stept out to see how an outhouse which he was thatching went on. He was surprized to find the work at a stand. He walked over to the thatcher's house. "Tom," said he, "I desire that piece of work may be finished directly. If a shower comes my grain will be spoiled." "Indeed, master, I shan't work to∣day, nor to-morrow, neither," said Tom. "You for∣get that 'tis Easter Monday, and to-morrow is Easter Tuesday. And so on Wednesday I shall thatch away master. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year, may not enjoy these few holidays."</P>
<P>"Tom," said the farmer, "when these days were first put into our prayer-book, the good men who did it, little thought that the time would come when <HI>holy-day</HI> should mean <HI>drunken-day.</HI> How much dost think now I shall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know master you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and to-morrow night, as the wea∣ther is so fine, I could clear about four shillings, after I had paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not so profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may spend in these two holidays?" "Why master, if the ale is pleasant, and the company merry, I do not expect to get off for less than three shillings." "Tom, can you do pounds, shillings, and pence?" "I can make a little score, master, behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well, Tom,
<PB N="51" REF="035296_0050_1001C0700690C940"/>add the four shillings you would have earned, to the three you intend to spend, what does that make?" "Let me see! three and four make seven. Seven shillings, master." "Tom, you often tell me the times are so bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the cost of two joints at once; to say nothing of the sin of wasting time and getting drunk." "I never once thought of that," said Tom. "Now Tom," said the farmer, "if I were you, I would step over to Butcher Jobbin's, buy a shoulder of mutton, which being left from Saturday's market you will get a little cheaper.— This I would make my wife bake in a deep dish full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the din∣ner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the chil∣dren—the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be ve∣ry savory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer mas∣ter, the times are so hard that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we used to do."</P>
<P>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear, Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away seven shil∣lings in keeping holiday. Now send for a quart of ale, as it is to be a feast; and you will even then be four shllings richer than if you had gone to the public house. I would put by these four shillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I would get a busnel of malt, and my wife should brew it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion." "I have a great mind to take your advice, master, but I shall be made such fun of at the Lion; they will so laugh at me if I dont go." "Let those laugh that win, Tom." "But, master, I have got a friend to meet me there."—"Then ask your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is sixpence for another pot, if you will pro∣mise to brew a small cask of your own." "Thank you, master, and so I will; and I won't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to the Lion.—
<PB N="52" REF="035296_0051_1001C07832FF3CA0"/>Come boy, bring the helm, and fetch the ladder." And so Tom was upon the roof in a twinkling.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE SHEEP-SHEARING.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. Shepherd happened to say to Farmer White one day, "that there was nothing he disliked more than the manner in which sheep-shearing and harvest-home were kept by some in his parish. What, said the good doc∣tor, just when we are blest with these natural riches of our land, the fleece of our flocks; when our barns are crowned with plenty, and we have reaped the fruits or the earth in due season; is that very time to be set a∣part for ribaldry, and riot, and drunkenness? Do we thank God for his mercies by making ourselves unwor∣thy and unfit to enjoy them?"</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint, sir," said the farmer, "I am resolved to rejoice, though, and others shall rejoice with me, and we will have a merry night on't."</P>
<P>So Mrs. White dressed a very plentiful supper of meat and pudding; and spread out two tables. The farmer sat at the head of one, consisting of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the neighbors, and all his work-people. At the other sat his wife, with two long benches on each side of her.— at these sat all the old and infirm poor, especially those who lived in the work-house, and had no day of festivi∣ty to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the grass, in the little court, sat the children of his la∣borers, and of the other poor, whose employment it had been to gather flowers, and dress and adorn the horns of the ram; for the farmer did not wish to put an end to any old custom, if it was innocent. His own chil∣dren stood by the table, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they carried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</P>
<P>This feast, though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shepherd dropped in with a good deal of company he had at his house, and they were
<PB N="53" REF="035296_0052_1001C07AA58DD0B8"/>much pleased. When the doctor saw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoying themselves, he was much moved; he shook the farmer by the hand, and said, "But thou, when thou makest a feast, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recom∣pense thee, but thou shalt be recompensed at the resur∣rection of the just."</P>
<P>"Sir," said the farmer, "'tis no great matter of ex∣pense—I kill a sheep of my own; potatoes are as plen∣ty as blackberries, with people who have a little fore∣thought. I save much more cider in the course of a year, by never allowing any carousing in my kitchen or drunkenness in my fields, than would supply many such feasts as these, so that I shall be never the poorer at Christmas. It is cheaper to make people happy, sir, than to make them drunk. The doctor and the ladies condescended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many merry stories, but not one profane word, or one indecent song: so that he was not-forced to the painful necessity either of reproving them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they sung the six∣ty-fifth psalm, and the ladies all joined in it; and when they got home to the vicarage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE HARD WINTER.</HEAD>
<P>In the famous cold winter of the present year, 1795, it was edifying to see how patiently Farmer White bore that long and severe frost. Many of his sheep were frozen to death, but he thanked God that he had still many left. He continued to find in-door work, that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was so considerate, that just at that time she lessened the number of her hogs, that she might have mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whey and skim-milk to assist poor familes.—Nay, I have known her live on boiled meat for a long time toge∣ther, in a sickly season, because the pot-liquor made
<PB N="54" REF="035296_0053_1001C082EAF49CD0"/>such a supply of broth for the sick poor. As the spring came on, and things grew worse, she never had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her house; though she used to have plenty of these good things, and will again, I hope, when the present scarcity is over; though the says she never will use such white flour again, even if it should come down to five shillings a bushel.</P>
<P>All the parish now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was sure the frost had killed the wheat. Farmer Wil∣son said the rye would never come up. Brown, the maltster, insisted the barley was dead at the root. But∣cher Jobbins said beef would be a shilling a pound. All declared there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye: and as to hay, there would be none to be had for love nor money.—"I'll tell you what," said Farmer White, "the season is dreadful.—The crops are unpromising just now; but 'tis too early to judge. Don't let us make things worse than they are. We ought to comfort the poor, and you are dri∣ving them to despair. Don't you know how much God was displeased with the murmurs of his chosen people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he sent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing satisfies grum∣blers. We have a promise on our side, that there shall be seed time and harvest time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide against an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it comes upon us, than sink under it when it comes. Grumbling cant help us. Activity can. Let us set about planting potatoes in e∣very nook and corner, in case the corn <HI>should</HI> fail, which, however, I don't believe. Let us mend our manage∣ment before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our honest laborers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head-lands of our ploughed fields, or other waste bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035296_0054_1001C087B7C6EE40"/>
The farmer had many temptations to send his corn at an extravagant price to a <HI>certain sea-port town;</HI> but as he knew that it was intended to export it against law, he would not be tempted to encourage unlawful gain; so he threshed out a small mow at a time, and sold it to the neighboring poor far below the market price. He served his own workmen first. This was the same to them as if he had raised their wages, and even better, as it was a benefit of which their families were sure to partake. If the poor in the next parish were more distressed than his own, he sold to them at the same rate. "For," said he, "there is no distinction of parishes in heaven; and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</P>
<P>He had been used in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now resolved to give up that pleasure. So he parted from a couple of spaniels he had; for he said he could not bear that his dogs should be eating the meat or the milk, which so many men, women, and children wanted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE WHITE LOAF.</HEAD>
<P>One day, it was about the middle of last July, when things seemed to be at the dearest, and the rulers of the land had agreed to set the example of eating nothing but coarse bread. Doctor Shepherd read, before sermon, in the church, their public declaration, which the magi∣strates of the county sent him, and had also signed them∣selves. Mrs. White, of course, was at church, and com∣mended it mightily. Next morning the doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to settle further plans for the relief of the parish. He was much surprised to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a very small wheat loaf, which she had been buying at a shop. He said nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expose the faults of a mistress to her servant, but walked on, resolving to give Mrs. White a severe lecture for
<PB N="56" REF="035296_0055_1001C093343FCF08"/>the first time in his life. He soon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the first person he saw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a sad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was slipped out of his sleeve, was swell∣ed in a frightful manner. Mrs. White was standing at the dresser making the little wheat loaf into a poultice, which she laid upon the swelling in a large clean old cloth.</P>
<P>"I ask your pardon, my good Sarah," said the doc∣tor, "I ought not, however appearances were against you, to have suspected that so humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintiness of your own, or to fly in the face of your bet∣ters, by eating white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I see it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have sent Tom to a surgeon, who would have done no more for him than you have done; for in those inflam∣mations the most skilful surgeon could only apply a poultice. Your kindness in dressing the wound your∣self will, I doubt not, perform the cure at the expense of that threepenny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom shall have a good supply of rice from the subscription." "And he shan't want for skim milk," said Mrs. White; and was he the best lord in the land, in the state he is in, a dish of good nice milk would be better for him than the nicest meat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE PARISH MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>On the tenth of August the vestry held another meet∣ing, to consult on the best method of further assisting the poor. The abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer white had a mind to be a little jocular with his desponding neighbors. "Well, neighbor Jones," said he, "all the wheat was killed, I suppose. The barley all dead at the root." Farmer Jones looked sheepish, and said, "to be sure the crops had turned out better
<PB N="57" REF="035296_0056_1001A3519F1E4730"/>than he thought." "Then," said Dr. Shepherd, "let us learn to trust Providence another time."</P>
<P>Among other things, they agreed to subscribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be sold out to the poor at a very low price, and Mrs. White was so kind as to undertake the trouble of selling it. After this day's work was over, all who wished to buy at these reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tuesday evening. Dr. Shepherd dropped in at the same time, and when Mrs. White had done weighing her rice, the doc∣tor spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"My honest friends, it has pleased God to visit this land with a scarcity, to which we have been little ac∣customed. There are some idle evil-minded people who are on the watch for public distresses, not that they may humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, (which is the true use to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit themselves by disturbing the pub∣lic peace. These people, by riot and drunkenness, dou∣ble the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will com∣plete our misfortunes, while peace, industry, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread, to be sure, is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to reduce the quality of it, a∣nother, to lessen the quantity we consume. If we can∣not get enough of coarse wheaten bread, let us make it of other grain. Or let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This last is what I eat in my own family. It is pleasant and wholesome. Our blessed Sa∣viour ate barley bread you know, as we were told in the last month's Sunday Reading of the Cheap Repository, which I hope you have all heard, as I desired the mat∣ter of the Sunday school to read it just after evening service, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the school. This is a good custom, and one of those little books shall be often read at that time.</P>
<P>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time
<PB N="58" REF="035296_0057_1001C09CF5A229E0"/>of scarcity; and I am going to shew my good will, as much by my advice as my subscription. It is my duty, as your friend and minister, to tell you, that one half of your present hardships is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without shoes and stockings, with great luncheons of the very whitest bread, and that three times a day. Half that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>antity, and still less-if it were coarse, put into a dish of good onion or leek por∣ridge, would make them an excellent breakfast. Many too of the very poorest of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I assure you it is what I cannot afford to do. Come, Mrs. White, you must assist me a little. I am not very know∣ing in these matters myself; but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable if the poor made a better use of their bounty. Mrs. White do give these poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go farther than it now does. When you lived with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap dishes, and I dare say you are not less notable now you manage for yourself."</P>
<P>"Indeed, neighbors," said Mrs. White, "what the good doctor says is very true. A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats, with a leek or onion, out of your own garden, which costs nothing, a bit or salt, and a little coarse bread, will breakfast your whole family. It is a great mistake at any time to think a bit of meat is so ruinous, and a great load of bread so cheap. A poor man gets seven or eight shillings a week; if he is care∣ful he brings it home. I dare not say how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now sugar and butter are so dear, because I should have you all upon me, but I will say that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the hardest fare. This, at all times, but particularly now, is bad management. Dry pease, to be sure, have been very dear lately! but now they are plenty enough. I am certain then, that if a shil∣ling
<PB N="59" REF="035296_0058_1001A359169C6BF0"/>or two of the seven or eight was laid out for a bit of coarse beef, a sheep's head, or any such thing, it would be well bestowed. I would throw a couple of pound of this into the pot, with two or three handfuls of grey pease, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or turnip, and carrot, or any garden stuff that was most plenty; let it stew two or three hours, and it will make a dish fit for his majesty. The work∣ing man should have the meat, the children don't want it, the soup will be thick and substantial, and requires no bread.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RICE MILK.</HEAD>
<P>"You who can get skim milk, as all our workmen can, have a great advantage. A quart of this, and a quarter of a pound of the rice you have just bought, a little bit of all-spice, and brown sugar, will make a dain∣ty and cheap dish."</P>
<P>"Bless your heart!" muttered Amy Grumble, who looked as dirty as a cinder-wench, with her face and fingers all daubed with snuff; "rice milk indeed; it is very nice, to be sure, for those who can dress it, but we have not a bit of coal; rice is of no use to us without firing." "And yet," said the doctor, "I see your tea-kettle boiling twice every day, as I pass by the poor-house, and fresh butter at eleven pence a pound on your shelf." "O dear, sir," cried Amy, "a few sticks serve to boil the tea-kettle." "And a few more," said the doctor, "will boil the rice milk, and give twice the nourishment at a quarter of the expense."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RICE PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>"Pray Sarah," said the doctor, "how did you use to make that pudding my children were so fond of? And I remember, when it was cold, we used to have it in the parlour for supper." "Nothing more easy," said Mrs. White. "I put half a pound of rice, two quarts of skim
<PB N="60" REF="035296_0059_1001C0A98E575360"/>milk, and two ounces of brown sugar." "Well," said the doctor, "and how many will this dine?" "S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven or eight, sir." "Very well, and what will it cost?" "Why, sir, it did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost you so much, because we baked it at home, and I used our own milk; it will not cost above seven pence to those who pay for both. Here too bread is saved."</P>
<P>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," said Farmer White. "I advise my men to raise each a large bed of parsnips. They are very nourishing, and very profit∣able. Six penny worth of seed, well sowed, and trod in, will produce more meals than sour sacks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have so little ground, it will not require more than an eight part of the ground which the four sacks will take. Parsnips are very good the second day warmed in the frying-pan, and a little rasher of pork or bacon will give them a nice flavour."</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd now said, "as a proof of the nourish∣ing quality of parsnips, I was reading in a history book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of parsnips, though Indian corn is so famous; it will make a little variety too."</P>
<P>"I remember," says Mrs. White, "a cheap dish, so nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel some raw potatoes, slice them thin, put the slices into a deep fry∣ing-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper. Then I get a bone or two of a breast of mut∣ton, or a little s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ip of salt pork, and put into it. Cover it down close, keep in the steam, and let it stew for an hour."</P>
<P>"You really get me an appetite, Mrs. White, by your dainty receipts," said the doctor. "I am resolved to have this dish at my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>." "I could tell you another very good dish, and still cheaper," answered she. "Come, let us have it," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed the doctor. "I shall write <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down as soon as I get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and I will favor any body with a copy of these re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ipts who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all at
<PB N="61" REF="035296_0060_1001C0AD82B9EFE0"/>my house." "And I will do more, sir," said Mrs. White, "for I will put any of these women in the way how to dress it, the first time, if they are at a loss. But this is my dish:</P>
<P>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a stone jar, fill it up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added she; "I have taken to use no∣thing but potatoe starch; and though I say it, that should not say it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</P>
<P>The Doctor now said, "I am sorry for one hardship which many poor-people labor under, I mean the diffi∣culty of getting a little milk. I wish all farmer's wives were as considerate as you are, Mrs. White. A little milk is a great comfort to the poor, especially when their children are sick. And I have known it answer to the seller as well as to the buyer, to keep a cow or two on purpose to sell it out by the quart."</P>
<P>"Sir," said Farmer White, "I beg leave to say a word to the men, if you please, for all your advice goes to the women. If you will drink less gin you may get more meat. If you abstain from the alehouse you may, many of you, get a little one-way beer at home." "Aye, that we can, Farmer," says poor Tom the thatcher, who was now got well. "Easter Monday for that—I say no more.—A word to the wise." The farmer smiled and went on. "The number of public houses in many a parish brings on more hunger and rags than all the tax∣es in it, heavy as they are. All the other evils put to∣gether hardly make up the sum of that one. We are now raising a fresh subscription for you. This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to sots, gamblers, and sabbath-breakers. Those who do not set their young children to work on week days, and send them to school on Sundays, deserve little favor. No man should keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If
<PB N="62" REF="035296_0061_1001C0B2B1C539E8"/>he feeds them at home they rob his children; if he starves them, they rob his neighbors. We have heard in a neighboring city that some people carried back the subscription loaves because they were too coarse; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane beg∣ged, with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," said the doctor, "we will listen to all modest complaints, and try to redress them." "You were pleased to say, sir," said she, "that we might find much comfort from buying coarse bits of beef. And so we might, but you do not know, sir, that we can seldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not so bad." "How so, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Job∣bins for a bit of shin, or any other lean piece, his answer is, 'you can't have it to-day. The cook at the great house has bespoke it for gravy, or the doctor's maid (begging your pardon, sir,) has just ordered it for soup.' Now, sir, if such kind gentlefolks were aware that this gravy and soup not only consume a great deal of meat, (which, to be sure, those have a right to use who can pay for it) but that it takes away those coarse pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am sure they would not do it. For indeed the rich have been very kind, and I don't know what we should have done without them."</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint, Betty," said the doc∣tor, "and I assure you I will have no more gravy soup.—My garden will supply me with soups, that are both wholesomer and better: and I will answer for my lady at the great house that she will do the same. I hope this will become a general rule, and then we shall expect that the butchers will favor you in the prices of the coarse piece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if <HI>we</HI> buy nothing but the prime. In our gifts we shall p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer has told you, those who keep steadily to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir work: Such as come to the vestry for a loaf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd do not come to church for the ser∣mon, we shall marl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and prefer those who come con∣stantly whether there are any gifts or not. But there is
<PB N="63" REF="035296_0062_1001C0B6E0B1A4E8"/>one rule from which we never will depart. Those who have been seen aiding or abetting any RIOT, any attack on butchers, bakers, wheat mows, mills, or millers, we will not relieve. With the quiet contented, hard-work∣ing man I will share my last morsel of bread. I shall only add, that though it has pleased God to send us this visitation as a punishment, yet we may convert this short trial into a lasting blessing, if we all turn over a new leaf. Prosperity had made most of us careless. The thoughtless profusion of some of the rich, could only be exceeded by the idleness and bad management of some of the poor. Let us now at last adopt that good old maxim, EVERY ONE MEND ONE. And may God add his blessing!"</P>
<P>The people now cheerfully departed with their rice, resolving, as many of them as could get milk, to put one of Mrs. White's receipts in practice that very night; and a rare supper they had.</P>
<P>I hope soon to give a good account how this parish improved in ease and comfort, by their improvement in frugality and good management.</P>

<PB REF="035296_0063_1001C0BB86F0E6B8"/>
<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>WILLIAM BAKER.</HI> BY THE REV. MR. GILPIN.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM BAKER was born in the year 1710, in the parish of Boldre, near Lymington, in Hampshire. His father dying when he was two years old, left him and a sister to the care of his widow; who by taking in washing, maintained her two children with∣out any relief from the parish.—In these days such in∣dustry would exceed belief.</P>
<P>At seven years of age young Baker began that life of labor, which he continued through the space of seventy years afterwards. He worked first for a penny a day in the vicarage garden; but soon thought himself equal to more profitable labor. He used to say he always consi∣dered himself as a poor friendless lad; and from the be∣ginning depended only on himself.</P>
<P>In the mean time his mother grew old and infirm.—Her legs swelled, and she could no longer stand at her was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tub. But nothing hurt her like the thoughts of going to the poor-house, or living on alms.</P>
<P>Her son was now about eighteen. He was healthy and strong; and assured his mother, that while he was able to work for her, she should be obliged to nobody, He took a little cottage therefore on the edge of the for∣est;
<PB N="65" REF="035296_0064_1001C0BD432004B0"/>carried her to it; and got into the service of a far∣mer in the neighborhood, as a day laborer. His mother lived nine years after this; during which time he main∣tained her with great cheerfulness, and kindness: nor had she ever assistance from any other person. He de∣nied himself every little indulgence which young fellows of that age often take, that he might maintain his mo∣ther.—We do not often see such an instance of goodness in a poor lad. It marked his character as something un∣common. He might, if he had pleased, have had her maintained by the parish.</P>
<P>About the time of his mother's death he thought of marrying. At a little distance from him, under the hill, lived a laborer of the name of Brooks. His daughter Joanna was the person whom Baker fixed on for a wife; and no objection being made, he married her, and bro't her to his cottage. Joanna had lived under a careful mother, just in the way in which he himself had always lived; and with the same notions of industry and fru∣gality. She entered therefore into all her husband's in∣tentions. What he gained, she put to the best use.—"We both pulled the rope," he used to say "by the same end; and so we compassed many things which they cannot do, who pull at different ends."</P>
<P>In the mean time, his family increased; and his in∣dustry increased with it. He now never worked "by the day," if he could help it; but took the hardest "task∣work" he could get, by which the most money was to be earned. And that he might "never" be idle, he took, at a small rent, of Mrs. John Burrard, of Lyming∣ton, a piece of rough ground, about nine or ten acres, on which he might employ his leisure. Many a time he was seen working in it before sun-rise; and if his day's work had not been hard, in an evening by moon-light. In a few years he made it worth much more, than when he took it; and he found it of great u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to his family in furnishing him sometimes with a crop of potatoes—or a
<PB N="66" REF="035296_0065_1001C0C5B2556FE0"/>little corn—or a few loads of hay; which enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to keep two or three cows, and as many forest-colts.—Some years after, his good landlady died; and this piece of land fell into the hands of Mr. Brailsfield, of Kentish town; who finding it was tenanted by a man, who had taken so much pains to improve it, promised neither to raise his rent nor to take it from him; which I mention to his honor.—Thus a kind of providence blessed all Baker's designs; and he was richer than many a man who is born to thousands. There are few men, who may not live comfortably, if they live "according to their station:" and if they "do not," the highest stations will not secure from difficulties. I have often heard Ba∣ket say, he never knew what want was: but then he never relaxed his usual frugality. When wheat was dear, to make all ends meet, he lived on barley; and when he could not with convenience compass a bushel of malt, he contented himself with milk, or water.</P>
<P>He had now sive children, who were a constant claim upon all his industry and frugality. But he had other claims. He had been kind to his sister, though her be∣havior did not entirely please him: and he was now call∣ed on from a quarter, he did not expect. His wife's fa∣ther, grown old, applied to him for assistance. Of this man he never had a high opinion; but for his mother-in-law he had always the greatest esteem. "She was as good a woman," he used to say, "as his wife; and could not say more for any woman on earth." However, tho' he could not pretend, with the incumbrance of so large a family, to maintain them entirely, he agreed with the overs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of the parish, that if they would pay them a shilling a week, he would do the rest. Accordingly he built them a little cottage; and was as kind to them as he could. Soon after, on the old man's death, he took his mother-in-law into his house, and kept her till she died <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o' she lived till she was upwards of ninety; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> many years.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035296_0066_1001C0C7C3DEE010"/>
About the time that his children were pretty well grown up, a fortunate circumstance happened. He re∣ceived a legacy of seventy pounds, and a clock. This money came very happily to settle some of his children. "They had it all," he said, "among them: he never had a belly full of meat out of it himself." The clock alone he kept. A clock was the only piece of furniture he e∣ver coveted; and he always intended, if it should be in his power, to have purchased one; though, it is proba∣ble, if a clock had not been thus thrown in his way, he would always have found something more useful for the employment of his money.</P>
<P>Nor was he kind only to his relations, as he got for∣ward in the world, he was very friendly among his neigh∣bors, and lent many a little sum to assist them in their distresses, But as he was a very shrewd, intelligent man, he lent only where he saw his money could be of use; to the spendthrift he would lend nothing, nor to any man who frequented an alehouse. So judicious was he in these loans, that although he helped many a man out of a difficulty, I have heard him say, he never lost a far∣thing by lending money in his life. Often indeed he re∣ceived the worth of what he had lent in a little corn, a pig, a calf, or something that was more convenient for the borrower to pay with than money.</P>
<P>He was now advancing into years, and his good Joan∣na began to feel the effects of age more than he did.—Her ailment was a mere decay of nature; but she was so entirely weakened, that she could do nothing for her∣self. Her husband hired a woman into the house to at∣tend her near seven years, in which she continued in this helpless state, Every thing he could do, he did for a wo∣man, "who," he said, "had been kinder to every bo∣dy than herself. In the year 1776 she died, and left him greatly afflicted for the loss or a faithful friend, who had followed close by his side, through all his laborious life, for the space of forty years. I have seen him speak of
<PB N="68" REF="035296_0067_1001C0CEC86B9420"/>her with tears in his eyes, and agitation in all he said, at the age of eighty.</P>
<P>He had now the world, in a manner, to begin again. His children were all married, or dispersed; and he had nobody with him, on whose arm he could lean in des∣cending the hill. He thought the wifest thing he could do, was to draw his little matters into as small a com∣pass as he could, and rid himself, as much as possible, of the cares of the world. Accordingly he sold his cows, and horses, and a little tenement or two, which he had purchased, and brought one hundred and ten pounds to a friend to put to some use. "For as I cannot now," said he, "work myself, I must make my money," as he phrased it, "work for me." His friend made him un∣derstand, as well as he could, what was meant by the funds, and advised him to put his money into consoli∣dated annuities for twenty-eight years from January, 1780. As this transaction was in the year 1782, when the funds were low, he was made to understand, that the interest would be considerable, (about eight pounds a year) but that the whole would be lost if he should live twenty-six years. However, as he did not look for∣ward to that time, he took his friend's advice. Besides this property, he had two or three other little sums put out to interest in private hands; and a little tenement, which he reserved for himself to live in; with two or three patches of ground, which lay near him, and serv∣ed to employ him.</P>
<P>He had a good opinion of the charitable societies or clubs, as they are called, in the several parishes around him; but he thought them useful chiefly to those, who could not depend upon themselvs. If young fellows could depend on themselves, and lay the same money by, without breaking into it, he thought it might gene∣rally be more useful to them. Four pence a week would amount to near a pound in the year. At harvest some little matter might be added to it. And if this practice
<PB N="69" REF="035296_0068_1001C0D400D804C8"/>were begun early in life, in a few years, it might amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>table support in sickness, or old age. "But few young fellows," said he, "looked forward to those times. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y never thought of more than of living from hand to mouth."</P>
<P>His manner now of spending his time, was somewhat different from what it used to be. He worked only a little, every morning, in his grounds, or in his garden, or in precuring fuel. The rest of his time he spent in reading and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>votion. He had always been a serious me, but a busy life had never allowed him much time for any thing but business. He had now gotten above the world—had his time much to himself—and spent a great part of it in reading the Bible, which was the on∣ly book he did read. He had the use of his eyes to the last, and generally, though by himself, read out, which he thought made the more impression on his memory. Oftener than once, as I have approached his lonely cot∣tage, I have thought I heard voices, but when I enter∣ed the old man was sitting alone, with his Bible before him. He had as strong natural parts as I almost ever met with, and easily understood, not only the general meaning and intention of the gospel, but many of the most difficult passages in it. What our Saviour said, he tho't, was very easy, and much of what St. Paul said. And he told me, he had a very good book of prayers, in his phrase, "for all intents and purposes."</P>
<P>As he grew more and more infirm, his friends tho't it comfortless for him to live entirely by himself, and endeavored to persuade him to get some good old wo∣man to live with him, who might take care of his house, and likewise of him, if any thing should ail him. "Aye," said he, "if I could get some good old woman▪ but where is she to be sound?" He had tried the experi∣ment, he said, but had no encouragement to try it again. People would not, he added, live now as he lived. Per∣haps he had bad luck in his choice, but he found, that a
<PB N="70" REF="035296_0069_1001A3757763E6B0"/>woman now would spend as much in junketting in one day, as would serve him for two. Then, he said, there was such constant gossipping, and noise in his house, that he could never have his time at his own disposal.—In short, he was obliged to live as they chose, not as he chose himself. Then fetching a deep sigh, he would say, "His good Joanna had spoiled him for living with any other woman."</P>
<P>It was then proposed to him to live with one of his daughters, who was married in the neighborhood. He had thought of that, he said, but an old man was always giving offence to one or another, and one or another was always giving offence to him. Besides, he said, his daughter had several children, and so much noise did not suit his quiet way of living. He could now, at his own ease, follow his own inclination. In short, it appeared, that while he lived, he wished to live entirely to him∣self; and that it was very indifferent to him when, and where, and how he died.</P>
<P>The destitute condition, however in which he lived, laid him open to the depredations of a dishonest neigh∣borhood. Many little thefts, when he was watched out of his house, were committed. Among other things his pewter flaggon was stolen. It hung over his dresser, and contained all his little securities, and promissory notes.—He had, however, with his usual sagacity, placed his money in such safe hands, that he had, on this occasion, no loss.</P>
<P>But among the petty thefts, which were committed in his house, was a robbery of a very serious nature.—On the day before Lymington fair the old man had re∣ceived some interest money (about five guineas) to pur∣chase a few necessaries. This being probably known, two men, at midnight, broke into his house. His fasten∣ing indeed was only such as a good shake might easily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lodge. They soon entered, and one of them pressing a bolster over his face, pinned him down with his knee,
<PB N="71" REF="035296_0070_1001C0D80FA3A598"/>while the other sought for the money, which was pre∣sently found. I heard him speak of the transaction the next day, and his behaviour raised him in my opinion. He spoke with the caution of an honest man. The thieves had a dark lantern, he said, with them, and he thought he could swear to one of them, but he durst not venture it, where a man's life and character were con∣cerned.</P>
<P>From several circumstances, however, it became more probable, that the man, whom Baker suspected, was guilty. And indeed he himself soon after confirmed the suspicion; for as the neighbors began more to talk of the thing, and to lay facts together, he thought it pru∣dent to leave the country.—Indeed if wicked men would only consider before hand the many circumstances that lead to discovery, and the almost impossibility of provid∣ing against them all, they would be more cautious, on the mere principles of prudence, in committing any des∣perate wickedness. One circumstance which tended to six the suspicion of the fact on this man, was, that a child accidentally mentioned having seen a cut cheese in his house the day after the robbery. Baker had lost a cut cheese, and it was well known the man had no cheese in his house before. The other person too was suspect∣ed; but if either of them had been taken up, it would, most probably, have discovered both: for a knave can∣not be depended on. And, indeed, it is probable, that both would have been discovered, had it not been for the the old man's scruples.—I mention all these circumstan∣ces, to shew that, in fact, it requires more care and cau∣tion to commit a wicked action than most men possess. It is, indeed, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss difficult to be Industrious, and by that means to make a wicked action unnecessary.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, however, the old man was thus so frequently preyed on by wicked people, he still continu∣ed to live alone. As to any farther losses, he had one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, he said or preventing them, and that was, to keep
<PB N="72" REF="035296_0071_1001C0DD56848E90"/>nothing about him that was worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tealing. He fasten∣ed, therefore, the old bolt upon his door, and went to sleep in his lonely cottage as quietly as if he had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n in a castle.</P>
<P>Though he had now enough before him, he continu∣ed still to live with his usual frugality. Many of his neighbors thought he might have indulged his age a lit∣tle more, as he had the means to do it; and as they themselves probably would have done in the same cir∣cumstances, by which they might have spent all they had laid up for their old age, not knowing how long God might have lengthened out their lives. He lived, how∣ever, as he had been accustomed to live, in the best of his days; for in many parts of his life he had been put to shifts. He had always good cheese in his house, and good bread which was his common food. He used to brew also now and then a bushel of malt; so that he was seldom without a little cask of beer. His garden produced him plenty of cabbages, which was the only plant he reared; and every year he bought at Lyming∣ton fair a side of bacon, a bit of which he would now and then put into his pot with a cabbage. Fresh meat he never tasted, nor were butter and tea among his neces∣saries. On this provision he never had a day's sickness; and even at those times when his food was less nourish∣ing, he was able to do every thing to which the strength of man is equal—What can the art of cookery do more?</P>
<P>He was now near eighty; his limbs began to fail; and he was subject to rheumatic pains, which seized his right leg, and made exercise very troublesome to him.—Notwithstanding, however, this infirmity, and his liv∣ing a mile from the church, he rarely missed taking a painful walk to it every Sunday. The weather must have been very bad to prevent him. And though he was now become very deaf, he did not think even that a rea∣son for keeping from church—What an example did he set to those, who, though in perfect health, instead of
<PB N="73" REF="035296_0072_1001C0DF37AC1B10"/>making the sabbath a day for obtaining instruction, and begging God's blessing on the week, profane it by mak∣ing it a day of pastime, and often a day of drinking and other wickedness. He was constant also at the sacra∣ment, which he always esteemed a part of his duty.</P>
<P>He was confined to his house about six weeks before he died. His illness was a mere decay of nature. His legs swelled, and his constitution was broken up. He now submitted to have somebody live in his cottage with him. He was pressed to send for a physician, as he had the means to pay him, but he was resolute against it.—"If you could find me a doctor," said he, "who would tell me at once, I can do you good—or I cannot do you good, I would send for him; but else, why should I send for a man to be paid for giving me physic, when I can∣not take victuals?"—In short, he knew he was dying, and wished to die with as little molestation as he could.</P>
<P>He kept his bed about three days; and was sensible to the last. He was in considerable pain, but he bore it with that firmness and manliness with which he had sup∣ported all the hard duties of a constant life of industry. He died on the 15th day of May, 1791, and desired that the 51st psalm might be sung before his corpse, as he was carried through the church-yard to his grave. The tho't was new, and the decency and propriety of it had a good effect.</P>
<P>On his death his effects amounted to about four hun∣dred pounds. That a man, in the lowest station, with a constant attention to money, should, in the course of a long life, raise that sum, or a greater, is not wonderful: but that a man, in the lowest station, should leave such a sum behind him, after discharging all the offices of life with uprightness and propriety, is such an example of an independent spirit, and of the force of industry and frugality, as deserves to be recorded for the benefit of others.—The following inscription stands over his grave in Boldre church-yard.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW XXV. 23.</BIBL>
<P>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the happiness of our religion, that all mankind, poor and rich, are equally able to please God. The lowest may be as acceptable in his Maker's sight as the highest; nor are any man's services so mean, as to be overlooked by his great Master. Before christianity, in∣deed, men were apt to think, that such only as had the powerful means of doing good, could obtain the favor of God, and that low people could do little to please him. But the gospel informs us, that God does not regard <HI>the action</HI> without <HI>the heart,</HI> from which the action pro∣ceeds; and that the <HI>willing mind,</HI> though unaccompa∣nied by the action, is as pleasing in God's fight, as the <HI>action itself.</HI> So that, you see, the rich and poor are all equally in God's favor. Let each of us only do his du∣ty in his proper station, <HI>as to the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, and not unto man</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="035296_0074_1001C0EEC9F149C0"/>—that is, with a desire to please God, who has placed us in our several stations, and the lowest of us shall be amongst those, to whom the text is applied: <HI>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</HI></P>
<P>But now, my brethren, among the duties of our se∣veral stations, there are some, which equally belong both to rich and poor; and there are some which belong to one station rather than the other.—Let me explain my meaning to you.</P>
<P>Among these duties, which belong to both, may be reckoned those duties which we owe to God—love, trust, reverence, prayer. Such also are the duties of reading, and meditating on scripture—of observing the sabbath —of faith in our Redeemer—of attending the Lord's Supper. Such also are humility—honesty—a desire to serve our neighbor, as far as we can—the care of our families—and other duties that might be mentioned.— All these are equally required from the poor and rich; because the poor may perform them as well as the rich.</P>
<P>But there are other duties which are <HI>not thus equally</HI> required. As the rich man abounds in the things of this world, it is required of him to be <HI>generous and cha∣ritable;</HI> because God hath enabled him to be so. But as the poor man cannot be generous and charitable, like the rich man, it is rather required of him to be <HI>indus∣trious</HI> and <HI>frugal.</HI></P>
<P>On the present occasion, therefore, I shall make the duties of <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> the subject of my dis∣course. I mention them together, because they must al∣ways keep company, to be of any use. <HI>Frugality</HI> can do little without <HI>industry:</HI> and <HI>industry</HI> as little with∣out <HI>frugality.</HI>—I shall give you the chief reasons, which should incline you to the practice of these duties.</P>
<P>In the first place, I would have you consider what the scripture says on this subject. It is often touched upon;
<PB N="76" REF="035296_0075_1001C0F3B3176FF0"/>but one of the most remarkable passages is that of St. Paul to the Thessalonians. <HI>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat: for we hear there are some among you which walk disorderly, working not at all. Now such we command, and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</HI> —Now this command that we should all <HI>eat our own bread</HI> is plainly founded on this reason, that nobody has a right to eat the bread of others, if he be able to pro∣cure his own.—In some cases, no doubt, the parish al∣lowance is a necessary relief—as when the father of a family is taken off, while his children are yet young— or when a family, perhaps, is greatly visited by sickness —or when a family is uncommonly large. But how many are there who shamefully run to the parish for relief, without any necessity of this kind? These are people who either want <HI>industry</HI> in providing for their families—or <HI>frugality,</HI> in not making the best use of what they provide. They frequent the ale-house, or they spend what they have in good eating, or in other things, which are not necessary. Let them consider how directly they break a scripture command, by <HI>eating o∣ther men's bread for nought,</HI> and by <HI>becoming charge∣able</HI> without necessity.</P>
<P>It may be hoped, that with christians a scripture com∣mand may have sufficient weight. However, I shall en∣deavor to shew you more at large, on what <HI>reason</HI> this <HI>scripture command</HI> is founded.</P>
<P>In the first place, how desirable is it to see your lit∣tle habitations as clean, neat, and well furnished as any of your neighbors—to see your children decently cloth∣ed —to give them what little education you can—to have them taught to read, which may be a comfort to them during their lives—to have them taught to spin and work, which may give them early habits of dili∣gence. But all this cannot be done without great indus∣try
<PB N="77" REF="035296_0076_1001C0F871F5EEA8"/>and frugality in the parent.—You have a choice, therefore, before you, whether it is better to do all this— at least to do it in the best manner you can—or to idle away your time, or spend your money in drinking at ale∣houses? How often are the children of idle parents sent to poor-houses, where their fathers' sins are visited up∣on them in all the wretchedness, misery, and neglect which the poor little sufferers are too often obliged to undergo.—Much have those parents to answer for!—I have myselt heard some of these idle parents alledge, that, as they made their money themselves, they had a right to spend it as they pleased.—To tell such people, that no man has a farther right to any thing, which God has given him, than to make a proper use of it, would be to little purpose, yet surely they must see the force of this, that if they marry, and have families, their families should be considered as a part of themselves, and have surely a right not only to their maintenance, but to the best in∣struction and care their parents can bestow. Who is the proper person to take care of the children but the parent?</P>
<P>I would have you consider farther, that <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> are virtues which have a particular tendency to keep you out of the way of temptation and mischief. Where, think you, is lewdness, and drunkenness, and profaneness, and sabbath breaking, and cursing, and swearing, and all other wickedness best taught? Its best school, I believe, is the alehouse. The devil tempts you to be idle first, and to love drink, then all wickedness follows naturally. He cannot so easily get hold of a fru∣gal, industrious man. The industrious man is otherwise employed. When the day's labor is over, be wishes for the night's rest. Between both he has hardly time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wicked. I believe, if you would look round your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quaintances, you will find the most industrious and the most frugal people to be also the best.</P>
<P>Consider farther, that <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> raise your
<PB N="78" REF="035296_0077_1001C0FAA8F2B250"/><HI>characters</HI> in the parish, and give you consequence.— You are often inclined to think yourselves of more con∣sequence than you really are. You are often ready to take offence when you hear any little story told of you, which you think you do not deserve, though probably the story may be very true. All this however shews you wish to preserve your characters. But you take the wrong way. It is not believing yourselves of conse∣quence, or desiring to stop people's mouths, that will give you credit with your neighbors. Leave your neigh∣bors to talk as <HI>they will;</HI> and do you act as <HI>you ought,</HI> and you need take no farther care about your charac∣ters. Honesty, industry, and frugality will give charac∣ter, and consequence to the lowest among you. He who supports himself by his own labor, is equal to any body. The richest man in the country is not more independ∣ent. While his idle neighbor, abject and base-minded, is pitifully going about begging relief of a parish-offi∣cer, <HI>he</HI> feels his own consequence, and is beholden only to his heavenly Master; he wants no assistance, but God's blessing and the use of his limbs.</P>
<P>Lastly, I should wish you to consider, that <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> are the best means of making you <HI>happy.</HI> I might say this with regard to the <HI>next</HI> world (for all virtues are generally more or less linked together, but I am speaking now only of the happiness of this life.— With what pleasure may a poor man look round him, and see all his family out in the world, and by the bles∣sing of God, doing well through his precepts and ex∣ample; and himself with some little matter still before him, if God should lengthen out his time a little longer? —There are many cases, no doubt, where it is impos∣sible that any thing can be saved; but in many families, even in this parish, I know, something might. If peo∣ple would only save what they spend at alehouses, or in things unnecessary, something might be laid by against a sit of sickness! or (if God should bless them with
<PB N="79" REF="035296_0078_1001C0FE8C7871A0"/>health) against old age. And is the pleasure, think you, of sotting at an alehouse equal to this comfortable in∣dependence? I know there are many who reason with themselves, that if they can maintain their families, while they are well, it is all they desire: when they are sick, or old, the parish is obliged to maintain them. It may be a person's misfortune to come to the parish; but when a man in the prime of his strength <HI>reasons in this way,</HI> I dare take upon me to say, he is, at the bottom, an idle, good-for-nothing fellow, and his reasoning is on∣ly an excuse for drinking, or some other extravagance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In general, such people go on in a regular progress to ruin. At first they get a love for liquor. They will sit whole days and nights in alehouses. They next get in∣to debt. If they have farms to manage, their affairs go wrong. If they are laborers, their families want bread; their children are half-starved and half-naked. I need not point out these people to you, they point out them∣selves. You see them loitering about the parish, languid wretches, with faces sodden, pale, and dropsical, the ob∣jects equally of pity and contempt.—Many, no doubt, frequent sotting houses, who have not yet gone this length; but they are in the high way towards it; let them take care in time, <HI>their</HI> ruin is coming on. There is no real happiness, my neighbors, you may depend up∣on it, in such a life as this. However you may be en∣ticed by the pleasures of idleness and drinking, (which last is commonly the beginning of all mischief) you may be assured, that all these things bring their bitter mo∣ments, not only <HI>at last,</HI> but <HI>continually;</HI> and that nothing can make a man so happy, as living in his station as he ought, with honesty, sobriety, industry, and frugality. No man can live happily, who lives at the will, and un∣der the control of others. These virtues allow a man to live, independent of others, and in the manner he wishes to live himself.</P>
<P>Such was the life of our very respectable neigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<PB N="80" REF="035296_0079_1001C10425D25F80"/>whose remains lie before us. His station in life, you know, was only that of a common day-laborer: but, as far as I could judge, he set just such an example in that station: and behaved exactly as he ought to have done. He had that generous independent spirit, which I have been recommending to you, that scorned to live upon the labors of others; and seemed to lay it down as a principle from the beginning of his life, to be obliged, under God, only to his own labor. By this alone he bred up a large family, without receiving a single far∣thing from the parish. But this could not have been done without great industry, and frugality. He worked hard; he lived hard: denying himself every indulgence in eating and drinking, that he might not be a burden to others.—When his family was off his hands, he tho't, for the same reason, it was proper for him to lay up a little for his old age. While he <HI>could,</HI> therefore, he con∣tinued still to work; and lived in the same hard man∣ner; which was now become quite easy; and habitual to him.—It pleased God to bless his labor; he laid up so much as maintained him, during his old age; and he has left something behind him to be a comfort to his children, if they make a right use of it. He never could be said to be wholly past his labor. Till within a few weeks of his death, he every day worked a little; and it became an agreeable amusement to him. He had, all his life, been used to laborious working. Many a time I have heard him say, that, in general, laborers now did not know what it was to work: and I have heard others say, who knew him better than I did, that he would have done as much in one day, as many people, do in two.</P>
<P>I have heard some of his neighbors tax him with be∣ing a miser and covetous; and say, that as he might have lived more comfortably in his old age, his hard living could be owing only to a covetous temper. He might it is true, have lived more comfortable in his old age, as
<PB N="81" REF="035296_0080_1001A37BC5D96408"/><HI>they</HI> may think, who accuse him—and who are fonder of indulgence than he was: but he could not have lived more comfortably to himself, than he did: and I am persuaded no man had ever less of the miser in his heart, But let me defend the character of my good old neigh∣bor in this particular: let me shew you the difference between his temper, and that of a miser.</P>
<P>A miser hoards money for <HI>its own sake.</HI> He does not consider the use it is to answer; not indeed puts it to any use at all. Hoarding it up is all he has in view. He <HI>loves money.</HI> You remember an instance of a person, not many years ago in this parish, who expired grasping his purse, under his bed-cloths, to his heart. Perhaps he meant to secure it, if he should recover; but it plainly appeared to be his first care; and if any should charge him with a love of money, I should not know how to defend him.</P>
<P>With covetousness, or a love of money, there is often mixed—indeed, I believe generally, a little knavery. If he who <HI>loves money</HI> do not openly cheat, he has many, ways of practising little under-hand, dirty tricks, which an upright man would hardly call honest.—I give you the best side of him, for the miser is generally a very wicked character. The apostle indeed tells us, that the <HI>love of money is the root of all evil.</HI></P>
<P>Had our worthy deceased neighbor these signs of a miser about him? As to his integrity, I dare take up∣on me to say, a more upright, honest man never lived. Many dishonest practices, I have heard of in the parish —many little knavish tricks, I have seen, to take advan∣tages, and get money, but I never heard of one action in the whole long life of our deceased neighbor, that was not fair, and honest, and upright in the highest degree: and I doubt not but you can all join with me in bear∣ing this testimony. So far then you will allow, that no∣thing of the temper of a miser yet appears. How should there? there was no foundation for it. He had no love
<PB N="82" REF="035296_0081_1001C1096C6AF8C0"/>for money, merely for its own sake, but as it might be the means of carrying him independently to the end of his life—and if he did not spend it all, that the remain∣der might be of some little use to his family. I have known him to do what in his circumstances were even generous things. Where he thought it necessary to spend his money, he spent it freely. He lived hard indeed, but whom did that hurt? It enabled him to do many a kind thing; but nobody ever suffered from it but himself. It is not <HI>living hard,</HI> it is not <HI>laying up money,</HI> that makes a man a miser; but it is the intention with which he lives hard—it is the intention with which he lays up the money. Our late neighbor's intention was merely that of an independent spirit, which could not bear to be sup∣ported by other people's labor. He lived hard himself, lest, if he had indulged himself, he should afterwards have been obliged to live on the labors of others.—And is there any thing in this like a love for money? He had no love for money that interfered, I dare take upon me to say, with any one duty that belonged to his station. How little he valued it for its own sake, I had many op∣portunities of seeing, as most of his money passed thro' my hands. Some years ago, you remember his house was broken open: he mentioned his loss to me, not like a raiser, but as far as his money was concerned, with christian indifference. His chief distress was for those, who had done the deed. To him, he said, they had done little injury. By the blessing of God, he doubted not but he had enough to support him while he lived; and it was owing, I believe, more to his lenity and scruple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than to the want of evidence, that the thieves were not convicted. So far from having any thing covetous about him, he appeared always to me entirely disengaged from, all worldly thoughts, strongly impressed with a sense o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> religion, and ready to leave all behind him with the ut∣most indifference, and begin his great journey to eter∣nity at a moment's warning, whene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it should p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<PB N="83" REF="035296_0082_1001C10D1E4A8828"/>God to call him. He used to talk of death, just as he would of one of the commonest events of life; and left with me a few directions about carrying his body to the grave, with as much indifference as a farmer would give directions about carrying a load of corn to his barn.</P>
<P>Thus, through a very long life he passed innocently, religiously, inoffensively, and quietly to that grave, to which we now consign him. Let me earnestly exhort all you, who, this day, follow his corpse thither, to fol∣low also his example—that, when it becomes your turn to be brought dead into the church, your neighbors may point out your example, as they may his, for others to follow, and apply to you, as I hope you may with justice apply to him, <HI>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou host been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE TWO SOLDIERS.</HEAD>
<P>TWO soldiers, Robert Wells and Isaac Clark, had obtained a three month's furlow from their col∣onel, to visit their relations and friends in a very distant part of England. On their return to join their regiment, which was quartered at Gloucester, having travelled till they were weary, they proposed lying by for the night, at a little alehouse called the Green Dragon, near the road-side.</P>
<P>Wells observing the house was pretty much throng∣ed with company, proposed to his companion to journey on to the next, where they might spend the night in more quiet, than the present prospect of things offered at the Green Dragon.</P>
<P>I'll not stir a step further to-night, said Clark, for where there is good company and good liquor, there I'll make my head-quarters; so throwing his knapsack on the horse-block, down he sat himself.</P>
<P>The Green Dragon was famous for brewing the best ale in those parts, and of course became the general ren∣dezvous of all the five-players, and skittle-players in the country; so very famous indeed was the liquor, that it introduced beggary and famine amongst the wives and children in all the neighboring cottages.</P>
<P>A silver-laced hat had been bowled for that evening, and the prize was won by a young farmer, who spying our travellers, swore a tremendous oath they should drink a bumper to the king's health.</P>
<P>After they had drunk plentifully, Wells twiched his comrade by the shoulder, and proposed that they should
<PB N="85" REF="035296_0084_1001C119875096D0"/>proceed on their march, now they had been refreshed with a friendly mug; Clark, with an oath, refused to comply, again repeating "the soldier's best head-quar∣ters was at the head of the beer barrel;" it shall never be said, Wells, that Isaac Clark was a starter, where the li∣quor was found, and the company good.</P>
<P>The liquor is very good sure enough, said Wells, who was naturally a very sober fellow, but enough is as good as a feast: and as to the company, I never be∣held a worse set of drunken, swearing rebrobates in my life, for which reason let us on, for if we cannot make them better, they may make us worse.</P>
<P>Thou art always for preaching Bob, said Clark, as if a body were going to die; why I was never In better health in my life; and 'tis time enough to be sorry for one's sins, when the lass glass is out, so halloo Tap, bring us another pot.</P>
<P>Thus in spite of the persuasions of poor Wells, he went on calling for another mug, and another till he was as drunk as a beast; and his brains whirled round like the vanes of a wind-mill. Unhappily in some degree, Wells fell into the same error; but unaccustomed to take more than his pint, and being quite overcome with fa∣tigue, he felt himself extremely disordered, and stag∣gering into the fresh air; he fell flat on the grass plat, where he lay in a dead sleep all night; nor did he awake till the day was pretty far advanced; when his teeth chattered in his head, and his limbs shivered with cold, for the night was damp and misty. As soon as he was able to stand, he staggered in search of Clark, whom he found in a still more deplorable state, for he had continu∣ed drinking till he was as mad as the rest of his compa∣nions: They grew quarrelsome at length, and each took offence at the other, till words proceeded to blows, and Move ended in blood; for a very profligate young but∣cher, struck his neighbor the shoemaker such a violent blow across the head with a quart pot, that his skull was
<PB N="86" REF="035296_0085_1001C120B877F2A8"/>fractured: This unlucky circumstance bro't the land∣lord to interfere, who was alarmed for the honor of his house, or to speak truly, the fear of losing his licence at next sessions; so he very prudently sent for a surgeon, whilst the rest of the joyous crew made their escape, for fear of falling into the hands of justice.</P>
<P>Our travellers left the Green Dragon, Clark's head was still too confused with liquor to permit him to think; but Wells, who was now quite come to himself, was overcome with shame; and inwardly vowed, that if the entertainment he met with at the Dragon was called a merry making, he would never desire to be merry again for the rest of his days; for what good have we obtain∣ed by it, said he, but empty pockets, bloody noses, ach∣ing bones, and the rod of justice hanging over our heads? Besides what is still worse, muttered he to himself, by being overtaken in liquor, we have lost our reason, which was the gift of God, and was given man as a precious token of his favor, to distinguish him from the brute-beast that perisheth.</P>
<P>Clark as they journeyed on, was spiteful, sullen, and sulky: Now and then muttering, that spite of the past he would get good ale wherever it was to be had.</P>
<P>And I, said Wells, would make a vow to drink wa∣ter for the rest of my days, rather than ever make my∣self a beast again, for I have a character to maintains and a soul to be saved.—And I'll tell thee Bob what is my design, rejoined Clark, to swim in strong beer when∣ever I can find it, if poverty and death both stared me in the face.</P>
<P>Thou talkest like a bold fellow, said Wells, and y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thou mayest tremble when death comes in sight pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣thee where dost think to go when thou diests I have never once thought about dying.

<PB N="87" REF="035296_0086_1001C1257940A1A8"/>measured against eternity; and if we make in the spring great preparations for a summer's campaign in the ar∣my, what constant preparations ought we not to be ma∣king for death!</P>
<P>We soldiers, Isaac, should be particularly careful to keep our accounts between God and our souls very short, since at the beat of the drum, on the day of battle, ten thousand may ruth, in a moment, into eternity, and the best Christian then may be reckoned the bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st man. Why, I would rather spend the next night in bat∣tle, for there I should be performing my duty to my king and country, than in another such a riot at the Green Dragon.</P>
<P>Thou art a wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> washy fellow, replied Clark, thou with never die GAME, if for every little offence thou art so plagued with qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of conscience: I am acre-mined to live my own way, both, come on't what will. Then take my word for it, said Wells, thy ruin is nor far off; for though in a fit of bravery thou mayest no∣pear to snake off the fear of God, the Devil may give up thy indentures at the last, and the law may take hold of thee in the mean time.</P>
<P>Then coming to a fine stream of water, Wells stoop∣ed down, and taking up some in his hat, drank plenti∣fully of it, saying it cooled the fever in his stomach.— Clark said he was feverish also, but he should cool his think with a glass of best Holland's at the next alehouse, which they saw at some distance on the side of the bill.</P>
<P>There, however, they agreed to stop: After having made a plentiful breakfast, they called for their bill, when, to their great dismay, they found their pockets entirely emptied of cash, except two shillings and a few halfpence, each having lost between two and three gui∣neas, which had been given them by their friends to de∣fray the expenses of their journey.</P>
<P>By what means they had been stripped of their cash, they could not imagine; whether the landlord had made
<PB N="88" REF="035296_0087_1001BF6955257F78"/>free with their pockets to pay himself, or that it had slip∣ped out in the general scuffle; they were greatly dis∣mayed, however, by their misfortune, for they had more than fifty miles to travel, and not more than ten pence left after the present expenses were discharged; and when the night came on, they were compelled to seek the most comfortable lodging they could find under a hay-stack.</P>
<P>We ought not to complain of our hard fate, said Wells, since what we are about to suffer is but part of the punishment due to our folly. With sobriety, and good management, our money would have enabled us to travel comfortably, and at the end of our journey we should have had plenty to spare, to have given a treat to our comrades, who have been often kind to us on a like occasion.</P>
<P>I'll never return to the regiment to be laughed at, said Clark mutteringly: I am almost famished to death —I'll desert. Prithee Isaac, said Wells, look well to thy words, and before thou art tempted to commit a great sin, ask thyself, how thou shalt like to bear the punish∣ment when thou art sound out: and if thou shouldest escape being brought to justice while on earth, it will find thee out in the day of judgment. Take my word for it, he is the only free, and, I may add, happy man, who is always doing the work of Him who made him. Talk no more of desertion then, dear Isaac, let us cear our misfortune like men, and as our catechisin says, pati∣ently resolve to do "our duty in that state of life unto "which it hath pleased God to call us."</P>
<P>When I was a child, Bee, said Clark, I never learnt my catechism; learning, which I have heard thee say, has kept thee out of so many scrapes, I hated; for I was a boy of spirit, I loved boxing, five-playing—and rob∣bing of orchards a deal better th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my book.</P>
<P>So much the worse for thee Isaac, a sober education to a poor man will help him on in the world much more
<PB N="89" REF="035296_0088_1001BF6B80B8FB78"/>creditably than a little estate without it; for laziness and drunkenness will soon bring a pretty property to nothing, and thou mayest have heard that
<Q><L>"When land is gone, and money spent,</L>
<L>"Then learning is most excellent."</L></Q></P>
<P>Honesty is the best policy, Isaac, and a good name is better than great riches. Think no more of deserting then, thou hast taken the king's money, and a strong oath to serve him faithfully, take care, then, that thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d coat be not stained with black spots. Consider we are all GENTLEMEN soldiers, then let us not disgrace ourselves by carrying the bloody marks of the rod of correction on our backs; if thou art resolved to behave so as to deserve punishment, don't murmur against the laws which must inflict it. The laws, Isaac, are only made to protect honest men from the snares of villians. —Courage man, don't despair of finding a breakfast in the morning; mayhap we may meet with some good, charitable, well disposed people, to whom we will relate our misfortune, and our disgrace, for I shan't be asham∣ed to ask for bread, now my folly has reduced me to ask for it.</P>
<P>This is fine talking, replied Clark, do as thou wilt, Bob, but my pride is above it; in this beggarly starv∣ed condition I'll never join the regiment, to be sneered and jeered at by every one; so I am resolved to have my own way for once.</P>
<P>Then remember, Isaac, it is a dangerous thing for a man to give himself up to the evil of his ways: I am only talking to thee for thy good, and since thou art de∣termined to have thy own way in every thing, I will only further advise thee to think, how thou can'st bear punish∣ment before thou committest a sin which will sooner or later bring down the vengeance of the law against thee. Have a good heart man, pluck up, that we may be able
<PB N="90" REF="035296_0089_1001BF6D9297B848"/>to begin our march by break of day; and, as I said be∣fore, we may meet with some kind assistance on the road; this is a charitable land, Isaac, and there are few people in it who are not ready to relieve distress, when it is known to be real; and if we should be repulsed at a surly door, we must not be angry, and unforgiving, since the kind hearts of the wealthy are so often impos∣ed upon, by false stories of misfortunes, that it often shuts up their bowels of compassion, when real misery stands before them.—Man's nature, Clark, becomes suspicious, when it has often been imposed upon.</P>
<P>My pride now is to meet our regiment before the time of our furlow is expired; it will give us great cre∣dit with our colonel, who is the very best of men, and who, seeing that we have made a generous use of the power intrusted to us, will not be afraid to indulge us again, at a sit time. For seven years that I have been in the regiment, I have never received an ill word, or an unkind look from my officers, because I always made it my pleasure to do my duty.</P>
<P>My pleasure then, replied Clark, is to have my own way; I don't care a rush for any man, I don't care for the general, I don't care for the colonel, nor I don't care for the captain—so I have made up my mind as to that matter—I'll have food whilst I can eat it—drink when I can get it—and money and pleasure wherever I can find them.</P>
<P>Clark, thou dost make me tremble sadly, said Wells, to hear thee talk so desperately; do turn thy thoughts to∣wards God, for there seems to be a strong temptation upon thee—humble thyself before him, tell him thou art a miserable sinner, and beg his mercy to assist thee in thy distress—don't go on adding sin to sin; we have been both guilty of an heinous fault; let us take this les∣son of instruction out of it, and resolve to do so no more. My father was an honest laborer, and he used to tell all his children, that drunkenness was sure to bring three
<PB N="91" REF="035296_0090_1001BF6FA09F5568"/>evils to every laboring man, namely.—sickness, hunger, and rags; besides no sin makes the heart so hard as drunkenness. A drunkard is without pity, since he can behold his wife and children dying of famine, because his own beastly appetite must have its fill of liquor at the village alehouse.</P>
<P>Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt preaching to a deaf man, interrupted Clark, I'll have my own way I tell thee again and again; it is time enough to rail against pleasure, when one has no power left to enjoy it.</P>
<P>Thou wilt live to repent thy sayings, take my word for it, said Wells; for my part I would rather eat a hard crust for my dinner, than dine with the officers on roast beef and plum pudding, if I must do dirty work to ob∣tain it. I would dine with any man, said Clark, who would give me a dinner, and drink with any man that would offer me his cup, though, perhaps, he did expect a little underhand business of me in return; I am re∣solved to serve myself, Bob, and there's an end of my chapter.</P>
<P>And a sorrowful ending it is, answered Wells, and so good night; drawing some of the loose hay about him, and placing his knapsack under his head for a pillow: I shall say my prayers, Isaac, for if I am taken off in my sleep, it is a good thing for a man to have had his last waking thoughts employed on the goodness of God.</P>
<P>Wells slept sweetly, till the rising sun shining on his face awakened him: he called aloud to his companion, telling him it was time to prepare for their journey; he called again and again, but still no answer was made him; he then rose to go in search of him, but he was no where to be found.</P>
<P>After waiting his return for near an hour, and find∣ing he did not appear, he set forward on his journey; after travelling some miles he began to find hunger very keen, and seeing a low farm house at a distance, he struck across a field and made up to it. Wells rapped at the
<PB N="92" REF="035296_0091_1001BF73488EEB00"/>door, which being opened by the mistress of the house, he very modestly asked her to give him a cup of whey, or a draught of small beer, for he was a good deal dis∣stressed.</P>
<P>Distressed—aye, to be sure, said she, the times are so hard, the world is full of distress.</P>
<P>The hardness of the times, ma'am, said Wells, has nothing to do with my distress, since it is all the conse∣quence of my own folly.</P>
<P>You must be an extraordinary man, Master Soldier, said Mrs. Jenkins, to confess that your own crimes have brought you to hunger.</P>
<P>I tell you nothing but the truth, said Wells, and hungry as I am, I would not impose a lie upon you, to obtain the best mouthful in your house; people in general rail at the badness of the times, when nine times out of ten they owe their misery to their extravagance; two nights ago my fellow traveller, and myself, accidently fell into bad company, we got drunk, and we lost our money; I have a journey of more than forty miles to make, and I have not a sixpence left to furnish me with provisions.</P>
<P>Follow me to the kitchen, said the good woman, and I will give you the best my house affords; I love a sol∣dier to my heart, because he fights for my country; but when I find a soldier to be a christian, I love him to my soul, because our country may stand a better chance to be preserved from the enemy in time of war, if our sol∣diers are christians; and since, my honest friend, you ha'n't the courage to tell a lie to God, I'm certain sure you'll never fail in doing your duty towards your coun∣try.</P>
<P>Wells now fed heartily on some cold pork and cab∣bage, and drank prudently of an excellent mug of cy∣der that stood before him.</P>
<P>After silently thanking the Giver of all good for a blessing so little expected, and so little deserved, he was about to take his leave of his kind hostess, when a hust∣ling
<PB N="93" REF="035296_0092_1001C0B99514AAE0"/>was heard in the passage, and soon after the room was filled by a croud of people, in the midst of whom Wells saw his unfortunate comrade Clark, with his hands tied behind him. His heart now misgave him, and it was as clear to him as the light, before it was ex∣plained to him, that Clark had been as good as his word, and would have his own way let come on't what would. He was as pale as death, his jaws trembled, and the tears ran down his cheeks.</P>
<P>The farmer now explained to his wife that they had taken the villain who last night would have robbed the post-chaise, but was prevented by a gentleman within it, who let fly a brace of pistols at him, which made him keep his distance; that early this morning, as he was riding to market, he himself had been attacked by him, before it was light, but some of the neighbors coming to his assistance, they determined to pursue the rogue, and came up with him about two miles off, as he was entering an alehouse. I have sent to the squire's, added the farmer, to advertise the gentleman who is at his house, that the robber is taken, and I hope he will soon be here.</P>
<P>Here poor Clark wept bitterly: Ah! Bob, Bob! said he, spying Wells, had I taken thy kind advice, I should never have been brought to this—I should have lived like a man, and died like a christian, but Lord have mer∣cy upon me, what have I brought myself to! I have brought my life into danger, and may be have ruined my own soul.</P>
<P>Honest Wells was grieved at heart: O Isaac! cried he, could I have preserved thee from such a grievous misfortune, I would have shared my last morsel with thee; my prayers are now all I can offer thee, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y prayer only thou can'st serve thyself, for the prayer of a penitent, even when offered up in a prison, may be ac∣cepted: If by timely repentance, Isaac thou can'st win the favor of Heaven, thou wilt find comfort under every affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="035296_0093_1001BF766A001EF8"/>
Here the gentleman arrived whose carriage had been stopped the preceding evening: Clark no sooner caught a glimpse of him than he knew him to be his own colo∣nel. A man whom every person in the regiment loved and honored as a parent, O my gracious father! ex∣claimed Clark, seeing this honorable gentleman enter, my punishment is already greater than I can bear, if I have offended the man I would die to serve. He then faint∣ed away, but a little warm ale being given him, he soon recovered, when the noble colonel spoke so mildly, and kindly to him, that Mrs. Jenkins put her apron to her eyes.</P>
<P>Here Wells related to the colonel what had passed, he shook like an aspen leaf, when he came to relate the sorrowful adventures which befel them at the Green Dragon, and all the grief and affliction which had be∣fallen him in consequence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>When Wells had finished his story—your father, Clark, said the colonel, could not feel more concern at your present situation than I do: I have always regard∣ed every man in my regiment as my son, for I have al∣ways tried to win their affection by kindness rather than inforce their obedience by severity. A man of true cour∣age, Clark, abhors the thought of a base action, but if he lives without principle in his heart, he must not be surprised, if sooner or later he is betrayed by his passions into the blackest sins; and if he is taken in the com∣mission of a crime he must expect to pay the penalty of the law.</P>
<P>Poor Clark groaned and wept bitterly, while the col∣onel thus continued—I am thankful that I wounded no man, when I fired my pistol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on being stopped last night in my carriage. As the night was much too dark for me to be able to give evidence as to the identity of the person who stopped me, you may expect, Clark, that no bill of indictment will be preferred against you by me; it is a most dreadful thing for any man to take an oath,
<PB N="95" REF="035296_0094_1001A2FAE510F7C8"/>when he is not positive as to the fact he is going to swear to: the farmer, I fear, from having secured your person, has certain evidence to bring against you, but that is a business in which I have no right to interfere, as your examination must take place before a neighbor∣ing justice of the peace. Whether the fact be, or be not proved against you, here is a title to support you, in case you should get your discharge, that you may not plead your wants as an excuse for committing such a dreadful outrage against society. After what is past it will be highly improper to admit you again into the re∣giment; in future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arn to labor with diligence, live so∣berly, then you will live honestly; be steady and con∣stant in attending on all the duties which your church enjoins you—learn to fear God, honor the king, and be just to your neighbor.</P>
<P>Tears now filled the eyes of all present, Mrs. Jenkins sobbed aloud, and every one declared, they had never heard so moving a sermon in their born days; they all said, what a fine thing scholarship was when applied to christian uses, and what a pity it was the noble colonel could not be made a bishop.</P>
<P>The colonel condescended to speak to Wells as kind∣ly as if he had been his equal. As for you, honest Ro∣bert, said he, your steady conduct has long been the sub∣ject of my observation, and my praise amongst all my brother officers; the sobriety of your life, and your re∣gularity at church makes you always ready in the per∣formance of your duty. I have long had it in my tho'ts to procure you some promotion, without being able to obtain the means. An occasion has presented itself in your absence: Serjeant Jefferson is dead, and I have re∣served his place for you. I know you can both write and cast accounts well: In this post I doubt not but you will exercise power with as much humility, as you have hitherto practised obedience with cheerfulness; and since this little affray has caused you much disappoint∣ment,
<PB N="96" REF="035296_0095_1001C0C99DA3CC90"/>and much delay on your journey, I will pay your fare, and your expenses in the stage-coach, which I find will pass this afternoon, that agreeably to your intentions you may join the regiment before the time of your fur∣low is expired, in order that your conduct may stand as an example to your comrades, that having been intrust∣ed with power, you had too high a sense of duty to a∣buse it.</P>
<P>What makes the end of this little story very moving, and very instructive is, that while Wells, for his honesty and good conduct, was enabled by his colonel to finish his journey by the coach; at the very moment in which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>unted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox, he saw his unfortunate comrade, Clark, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hands tied behind him, carried off to the county <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ol, to take his trial at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e next assizes, sore∣ly lamenting his unhappy fate, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the wilful obstinacy that made him deaf to the excellent advice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood a friend.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CHARLES JONES, THE FOOTMAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</BYLINE>
<P>MY Father, George Jones, commonly called Black George, on account of his swarthy com∣plexion, was one of the most industrious men in the whole village.—His cottage, which was his own, and partly built by his own hands, stands on the Common, about a stone's cast from the road, near the great oak-tree, in the parish of King's Charles∣ton, in somersetshire.—The lord of the manor having granted him leave to inclose a bit of the common for a garden, my father had got a thriving young orch∣ard, and a long strip of potatoes, besides his cottage, all the produce of his own industry. It used to be a favorite saying with him, that no man, to whom God had given two hands, had ever need to want. "For my part, says he, I never knew what want was.— When I am sick, the club supports me; and when I am well. I warrant I'll support myself." My mo∣ther, besides being equally industrious, was much more religious, and therefore much happier. She was as good and as sweet tempered a woman as any in the world, be the next where she will. For con∣stancy at her place of worship, civility to her neigh∣bors, cleanliness in her own person, her house, and her children, she had not her fellow. But the most remarkable thing in her (I am afraid a very uncom∣mon thing) was her steady and uninterrupted practice of family prayer. It must have been a hard day's
<PB N="4" REF="035296_0098_1001BF88B80913D8"/>work indeed that hindered her from her prayers.— At six in the morning, and eight in the evening, as regularly as ever the hour came, she always knelt down, with her children round her (four of us) and read with great solemnity and devotion, a short form given her by the clergyman, which concluded with the Lord's prayer, in which we all joined. And she used to say after she had finished—"Now I can go to bed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> work in peace; for now we may hope God will protect us."—I am sorry to say my father sel∣dom joined with us. He used to pretend he was bu∣sy or tired; and yet it would not have detained him long neither, for we were never more than six min∣utes about it, and surely twelve minutes a day (six in the morning &amp; six in the evening) is no great time to give to God. One thing has often struck me, that if any thing went wrong, and ruffled my dear mother's temper, or made her uneasy, the prayers seemed to set it all to rights. When she had been to prayers, all her grief seemed to be fled away. And, indeed, I observed the same thing with respect to my father; if he ever did join with us, it always seemed somehow to compose and sweeten his mind, and make him a great deal kinder to my mother and us.</P>
<P>As my father and mother were very industrious themselves, they were very desirous to make their children so; every child was employed, as soon as he was able, in something or other. At about thir∣teen years of age, my employment had been for some time to weed in the parson's garden, and run of er∣rands for him. At fourteen he took me into his house, and not a little proud was I at obtaining the title of his "little footman." The morning I left my father's cottage, my dear mother, who was as kind as she was good, appeared to be very much af∣fected; she said she could not commit me to the wide world, without first committing me to God, who go∣verned
<PB N="5" REF="035296_0099_1001BF8B03685C38"/>it; and then she knelt down with me by her side, and prayed, "Gracious Lord, be pleased to have mercy on my dear boy. To thy care I commend him. Guard him, I beseech thee, in the many temp∣tations he is now beginning to encounter. May he with solid piety and honest diligence do his duty in that state of life in which it hath pleased thee to place him." She then gave me her blessing, put a Testa∣ment into my pocket, bid me fear God, and always act for my master as I would do for myself.</P>
<P>In my new situation there were, to be sure, some sew things disagreeable. My mistress was peevish and fretful; the cook violent and passionate. But what service is there, or indeed, what situation in life, howsoever much above servitude, in which there is not something unpleasant. Every state has its trials: servants have theirs; but if they cannot learn to put up with some little inconveniences, they may charge their places every year of their lives, and ne∣ver be satisfied after all. This is a lesson I have learnt by long experience.</P>
<P>Though, by God's blessing, I had received a more religious education than most children, it yet soon appeared that I had many faults, which it was necessa∣ry for me to be corrected of before I could become a good servant. At first, when I was sent upon an er∣rand, I was much given to loitering. I was then too young to consider that by loitering in errands, I was wasting what was not my own, my master's time.— Besides this fault, as every thing which I saw and heard in my master's house, was such as I had never seen and heard before. I was too apt to talk of it to my old play-fellows, or at the village shop. But as soon as ever I became a little older, I began to reflect that this was very wrong. One Sunday evening, whon I had leave to go home to see my parents, I was beginning to tell my mother how there had been
<PB N="6" REF="035296_0100_1001BF906729A280"/>a great uproar at the parsonage the day before about —. Here she put her hand upon my lips, and said, "Charles, not a word more of what has passed at the parsonage. Whatsoever happens in your master's house is never to be spoken of out of your master's doors. A tale-bearing servant is always an unfaith∣ful servant; he betrays the trust which his master puts in him."</P>
<P>My mother's vehemence surprized me a little, but it made so much impression upon me that I was pret∣ty well broken of the fault from that very time. Into how many scrapes has this talkative temper brought many servants of my acquaintance! There was poor Nick Jarrett, the Squire's under footman, that lost his place, a new suit of black broad cloth, and a lega∣cy of five pounds, which he would soon have had by reason of his master's death, only for saying at a neigh∣bor's house, that his mistress sometimes fell asleep while the squire was reading to the family on a Sun∣day night.</P>
<P>Nick and I were at one time rather too intimate; I remember one day, when I was about sixteen, hav∣ing attended my master to the Squire's house, Nick prevailed on me after dinner to play with him at pitch and toss. I was worth at that time five shillings and two-pence, more money than I had ever possessed before in my life. In about two hours Nick reduced me to my last shilling. But though it was a heavy stroke at the time; yet it proved in the end a happy event, for, by my mother's persuasions, I resolved thencefor∣ward never to game again as long as I lived, which resolution, by God's grace, I have hitherto happily kept. I wish from my heart that all other servants would resolve the same. The practice of card-play∣ing, so common amongst servants in large families, is the worst custom they could possibly fall into.—My poor brother Tom suffered enough for it. One day,
<PB N="7" REF="035296_0101_1001BF96E44EB550"/>having received in the morning a quarter's wages, he lost the whole of it before night at All-fours; and what was the consequence?—Why, from that very time, he took to those practices of cheating his master which ended in his ruin. How much better would it be for all servants, if instead of wasting their leisure in card-playing, they would amuse themselves in read∣ing some godly book, or improve themselves in writing or cyphering. It was by this means, for I was nev∣er taught to write, that I qualified myself for the place of Bailiff, which I now fill.</P>
<P>I remember Nick used to say, "Whilst my master plays cards in the parlour, why shouldst thou be so squeamish as not to play in the kitchen." But Nick did not consider that his master being rich, and play∣ing for small sums, his losses laid him under no temp∣tation of dishonesty in order to repair them; besides, the Squire could read and write at any time, whereas this was our only leisure time, and if we did not im∣prove ourselves than we never could; what might be comparatively innocent in him, might be ruinous to us. And even if my master be a professed gambler, that is no reason I should be so too. A servant is to do what is right, let his master do what he will. If a master swears and gets drunk, and talks at table with indecency, or against God and religion, to God he must account for it, and a sorry account it will be I doubt; but his example will not excuse our crimes, though it will aggravate his. We must take care of our own souls, whether our masters take care of theirs or not.</P>
<P>But to return to my history; I am ashamed to say that I was guilty more than once in the earlier part of my servitude, of the shocking and detestable crime of lying in order to excuse or screen my faults.— Happily I was cured of it in the following manner: Having been one day ordered to carry a bottle of
<PB N="8" REF="035296_0102_1001BF9A9A73BA80"/>wine to a sick man, one of my master's parishioners, I accidentally broke the bottle, and of course, lost the wine. What was to be done? Should I confess my misfortune and acknowledge my carelessness, or conceal it by a lie? After some deliberation, I resol∣ved upon the lie. I therefore had made up my story, "how the poor man sent his duty to my master, and thanked him a thousand times, and that he was a lit∣tle better, and that his wife said she thought this wine would save his life." Being thus prepared, as I was returning home, I met a pedlar, of whom I bought for a penny a little book, containing a story of a woman at Devizes, who was struck dead on the spot for tel∣ling a lie. To be sure it was heaven that sent the pedlar to me, to save me from the sin I was going to commit. "If this woman was struck dead for a lie," said I to myself, "why may not I?"—I therefore went directly home, and made a confession of my neg∣ligence and misfortune. And it was well for me I did; for the sick man, whose duty and thanks I had wickedly intended to carry my master, was dead, as I understood afterwards, three hours before the bot∣tle was broken. From this time, therefore, I began to see what I am now fully convinced of, that besides the sinfulness of lying, it was always more for the interest and lasting comfort of servants, to consess the truth at once, than to conceal a fault by fals∣hood. When a servant has told a lie, he is always in danger of its being found out, and sooner or later it generally is sound out, and then his character is rumed. Whereas, if he confesses the truth at once, he probably escapes without any anger at all, or it worst it is soon over, and the fault itself is forgotten.</P>
<P>Having now lived seven years at the parsonage, &amp; being twenty-one years of age, my master called me one day into his study, where he spent a good deal of his time, and said to me, "Charles, you have lived
<PB N="9" REF="035296_0103_1001A2FCE56F5408"/>with me a considerable time, and it has been always with much pleasure that I have remarked the decen∣cy, sobriety and diligence of your conduct. Those few faults which you have, farther experience and more years will I doubt not, cure. You are now qualified for a better place than mine, and are enti∣tled to higher wages than it is in my power to give. I have therefore recommended you to a friend of mine in London, for which place you are to set out, if you approve it, in a month. But I should think it a crime to dismiss you to a situation so full of temp∣tations, without giving you some little advice. Lis∣ten, therefore, my dear Charles, to what I shall say as I mean it only for your good. In the first place fear God, and then you will never have any occasion to be afraid of man. Act always as in his presence. Never enter or quit your bed without prayer. Do always for your master, as you would your master, if you were to change places, should do for you. En∣deavour to get a pious friend, but avoid, as you would the plague, all wicked company. Be cautious of too great familiarity with your female fellow-servants; an unlawful intercourse of this kind will ruin you, body and soul. Flee from an ale-house as you would from the Devil; if you once get into it, you will never be out of it. Keep your money and your money will keep you. Here, Charles, is a bible for you; the more you read it, the more you will love it, and the more you love it, the better you will be and the hap∣pier. I have written some directions for you in the first page of it. God! less you; and when my race which is now drawing to its end, shall finish, may we meet in heaven." My master's kindness so affected me, that I could not answer him for tears. I was indeed very glad of going to so fine a place as Lon∣don, though, at the same time. I could not leave a house where I had been treated more like a child
<PB N="10" REF="035296_0104_1001BF9E1D3416E8"/>than a servant, without great regret. I shall not at∣tempt to describe my parting with my mother. No description, I am sure, could do justice to the solemn and affectionate manner in which she exhorted me to be pious and just, and recommended me to God in prayer. Her last words I shall never forget. "I know my dear son," said she, "that you love me ten∣derly, and that you would not give me unnecessary pain on any account. Remember then, that whenever you do any wrong thing, you are planting a dagger in your mother's heart." With these words, her eyes brim full of tears, and her hands lifted up in silent prayer, to God she turned away from me and went into the cottage.</P>
<P>And now, reader, you find me in the great and dangerous city of London, in the service of a very wealthy master, who kept twelve servants besides my∣self. If country people knew London as well as I do, how cautious they would be of exchanging their safe and peaceful situations in the country, for the pe∣rils and temptations of a great city. How many young fellows have I known, who lived honestly and happily in their native place, come up to London in hopes of higher wages, and there forfeit their integ∣rity, their peace of mind, their health, their charac∣ter and souls. Workmen in particular are very fond of getting into large cities, because they think their labour will turn to better account there than in their own villages. They do not consider that in a city they must give as much for a filthy room in a filthy house, inhabited by half a dozen families, situated in a close, smoky, dirty, street, as in the country would pay the rent of a cottage and a garden. They do not consider the dearness of provisions in a city, the temptations they are under from bad women, wicked company, and the great number of ale-houses. In short, I am fully persuaded that a laborer in the
<PB N="11" REF="035296_0105_1001BFA2DB11B7D0"/>country, on a shilling a day, is better off than one in the city on two shillings.</P>
<P>When I came to my place, I found every thing for the first three or four days very smooth and very pleasant, plenty of provisions, plenty of drink, little work, and a very merry servant's hall. But soon the face of things, with respect to me, changed very much, and I underwent a severer temptation than I ever experienced before or since in my life. I had always hitherto been taught to consider that sobriety and diligence, and piety were virtues. I therefore never swore, I never got drunk, I never gamed, I went to church as often as I could, I said my prayers night and morning, and on Sunday at least, if not on other days, I read a little in my good old master's bi∣ble. But here I soon found that all this was the worst vice I could be guilty of. As soon as they found me out, it seemed to be a trial of skill amongst them who should plague me most. One called me the Parson; another, Methodist; a third, a conceited Prig; a fourth, a canting Hypocrite. If I went into any o∣ther gentleman's kitchen it was all the same; my character always slew before me, and many were the jests and laughs raised both at home and abroad at my expense. In short, during three months, my life was a constant state of anxiety and torment; so that at last I was almost tempted, God forgive me for the thought, to do as they did, and forfeit my everlasting soul in order to avoid present uneasiness. But while things were in this state, I felt myself greatly and unexpectedly relieved one Sunday morning, by a ser∣mon which I happened to hear from our parish min∣ister, on the following text—<HI>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil of you falsely for my sake, for great is your reward in heaven.</HI> The excellent dis∣course which this pious man delivered on these words
<PB N="12" REF="035296_0106_1001BFAA62A045E8"/>was so exactly suited to my circumstances and feel∣ings, that it seemed as if it had been addressed solely to me; and it pleased God so to apply what had been said to my heart and understanding, that I not only determined to bear in <HI>future</HI> the sneers and scoffs of my fellow-servants, with patience and forti∣tude, but even those very sneers which I formerly considered as my heaviest calamity, were now no longer grievous. From this time, therefore, my un∣easiness was pretty well at an end. And I earnest∣ly recommend it to all other servants, who have been so happy as to acquire sober and virtuous habits, not to suffer themselves to be laughed out of their sobri∣ety and virtue, by the jests and ridicule of their fel∣low-servants. They may depend upon it that their cause is a good one, and though they suffer for it at first, they will finally triumph. In a short time all my persecution was at an end. "To be sure," said the coachman one day to the cook, "Charles is a lit∣tle too religious, but upon my word I don't think he is any the worse for it. Mayhap it might be better for us if we were more like him. I don't see but that he is as humble, friendly and worthy a fellow as any a∣mongst us. For my part I shall laugh at him no lon∣ger." This speech which I happened accidentally to overhear, gave me great pleasure, and I soon found by the agreeable change in my fellow-servants' conduct towards me, that the coachman had expres∣sed the opinion of the whole hall. It is true I did every thing to obtain their good-will, that lay in my power. I was as civil and obliging to every one a∣mong them, as I possibly could. Was any thing to be done? If nobody else would do it, I never stopped to consider whether it belonged to my place or not, but did it out of hand. If any body took it into his head to fall out with me, I generally disarmed him of
<PB N="13" REF="035296_0107_1001A2FE9B728128"/>his wrath by saying nothing. If any little quarrels or misfortunes, or misconduct, happened in the hall, I always endeavoured to hush it up, and never car∣ried any tales to the master, unless when I saw any body wronging him, and then I thought it my duty, or unless the thing was very bad indeed. In short by pursuing always this line of conduct, I found my situ∣ation very comfortable and agreeable. My master treated me with great confidence and kindness: my fellow-servants with great friendliness and respect.</P>
<P>In about two years time, the footman that used to go to market being turned away for drunkenness, which vice soon proved his ruin, my master told me that as he believed I was an honest and careful young man, and perceiving that I could write and keep an account, he should in future employ me in marketing. To market, therefore, I went every day, and as I had now a good deal of my master's money always in my hands, I prayed heartily to God that he would be pleased to preserve me under the temptation to which this exposed me. My first exploit in this way was the purchase of ten shillings worth of fruit at a fruit∣erer's. When I had finished my bargain and was coming out of the shop, the fruiterer slipped a shilling into my hand. As I had never to the best of my re∣collection, seen him before, I was somewhat surpri∣zed at his generosity; but fortunately had the pre∣sence of mind to ask him whether he had charged his fruit the higher on account of this present to me. "Why young man," said he, "that is an honest ques∣tion, and I will give you an honest answer. The fact is, that as we know that gentlemen of your cloth expect some complement from the tradesmen they deal with, we are obliged in our own defence, to charge our articles the higher on that account to their mas∣ters." "And so," said I, "the money you give us, comes finally from the pockets of our masters?"—
<PB N="14" REF="035296_0108_1001BFB1A9CD08D8"/>To be sure it does." "Why then," said I, "I will take your shilling, but shall charge my master only nine shillings." And this method I constantly pur∣sued in the like case ever after; for I think the above mentioned practice of footmen, which, however, I hope is not very common with them, is just the same thing in conscience as if they should rob their mas∣ter's bureau.</P>
<P>One Monday morning, having settled my account for the last week with my master, I found that he had made a mistake against himself of twenty shillings. As soon as I discovered it, I said to myself, here now is an opportunity of getting twenty shillings without any risk of detection: but God forbid that I should do it, as it would ruin my peace of mind, &amp; destroy my soul. I therefore pointed out the error to my master the first opportunity. "Charles," said he, "you are right, the mistake is obvious, I acknowledge I made it purposely to try your honesty. You shall find that this affair will turn out, before long, to your advan∣tage." Now, though I do not think it quite fair for masters to lay this kind of trap for their servants' in∣tegrity, yet as I know by experience they sometimes do it, we must be doubly on our guard. Indeed dishon∣esty is never safe; it always will out somehow or o∣ther. I have seen surprising instances of the discov∣ery of it, when it, seemed to have been com∣mitted with such cunning as to be impossible to be detected. One day, as I was going to market, I met Sir Robert S's butler, who told me, that having long observed my sobreity and diligence, he was hap∣py to have it now in his power to offer me a place in his master's family where my wages should be raised two guineas a year. I thanked him, and told him he should have his answer next evening. In the mean time, I called upon a pious and worthy friend, whom I consulted in all difficulties, and asked his o∣pinion.
<PB N="15" REF="035296_0109_1001BFB713D1F1B0"/>After mature deliberation, he said, "Charles don't go. When you are once got into a good place, stick to it like a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h. The rolling stone gets no moss. The more years you continue in one service, the more you are respected by your master and all the world. A good, family considers an old servant as one of them∣selves, and can no more see him want than a near rela∣tion. Whereas servants that are continually roving from place to place, have no friend in distress, and sel∣dom get a provision for old age." Happy it was for me that I followed this good advice. If I had not I should probably been nothing more than a poor footman all my life.</P>
<P>But before I bring my own story to an end, I must beg my reader's patience, to listen to the sad fate of my poor brother Tom. Alas! poor Tom, he was a great favorite in our kitchen, because he sung the best song, and told the merriest tale, and paid his card money the most f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly of any gentleman footman about town. And then he swore so much like a gentleman, and was so com∣plaisant to the ladies, and pushed about the strong beer so merrily that he was, said our servants, the most argee∣able company in the world. And yet all those enter-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning qualities did not preserve my poor brother from the most distressful state of distress and ruin. One mor∣ning he came to me about ten o'clock with a very woe∣ful face, which was a thing very unusual for him, and told me that he had just been turned away from his place without a character, and that he had no money, many debts, and no real friends, and what was worse than all, that he was laboring under disease.</P>
<P>Tom grew worse every day, and was at length given over. In the morning of that day, while I was sitting at his bed-side, who should come in but my dear mother. She had walked 130 miles, except now and then a list in the waggon, to attend upon &amp; comfort her undeserving son. When she saw him, pale and emaciated, and his
<PB N="16" REF="035296_0110_1001BFB8B2C26E38"/>face half consumed by disease, it so shocked her that she sainted away. As soon as she recovered, and was a little relieved by a plentiful flood of tears, she said, "my dear Tom, I am come to take care of thee, and make thee better if I can." "Alas! mother," answered he, putting his clay-cold hand into her's, "it is all too late. I have but a few hours to live. It is by neglecting your advice that I am brought to this. Gaming and drink, and bad company, and bad women, have been my ruin. O! what will become of my soul! If I could but live my life over again." Here he was seized with a sudden fit, and though he lived some hours, he never spoke after, and died that evening in my mother's arms.</P>
<P>After recounting the sorrowful history of my unhappy brother, I must now hasten to conclude my own. A∣bout a twelvemonth after the offer of a place in Sir Ro∣bert S—'s family, my master, in consideration, as he said, of my faithful services, made me his butler. He was indeed so kind and friendly to me on all occasions, that I found it necessary to be extremely cautious lest I should grow proud, or saucy, or familiar, which some servants, when they live long in a place, and find them∣selves in favor, are apt to do. After enjoying this post about six years, our family being now removed into the country, I made acquaintance with a farmer's daugh∣ter living near the great house, whom, on account of her religious and industrious principles, and her amia∣ble and cheerful temper, I wished to make my wife. She was no flaunter in fine cloaths, none of your dancing, flirting, forward lasses, that run about to christenings, and revels, and hops, that will ruin a man before he knows where he is; but a pious, sober, stay-at-home, industrious young woman; else I am sure any body might have had her for me. As I had never been guil∣ty of any unnecessary expense, for nobody will call that unnecessary which I sent yearly to my parents, my say∣ings, the interest being added yearly to the principal in
<PB N="17" REF="035296_0111_1001BFBB39AB8CC0"/>the hands of my master, amounted to 200 pounds. And as Fanny's father promised to give her another hundred, I thought we might with this take a small farm, and maintain ourselves comfortably and decently. I therefore communicated the affair to my master.— "Charles," said he, "though I am loth to part with so good a servant, yet I think it an act of gratitude due to you for your long and faithful services, to consent to a∣ny thing which may be for your welfare. But I do not think it necessary to part at all. I am at present in want of a bailiff. You may, if you approve it, undertake that office and still retain your present wages. Your father-in-law, who is an experienced farmer, will instruct and assist you in the duties of it. I will, besides, let you a small farm on an advantageous lease, which you may make the most of for yourself.</P>
<P>To this kind and generous offer I joyfully assented. And Fanny and myself have now lived together six years in the farm-house, near the park-gate, happy and prosperous. My father being dead, and my brother and sister settled, my mother, who is now very old, lives with me, and by her example and exhortation, I find a sense or religion sink deeper and deeper into my soul everyday; and, indeed, I am firmly convinced by long experience, that there is nothing in this world can make us truly happy but that.</P>
<P>I address this little book, which I wrote by little and little in the long evenings of the last hard winter, to all footmen. I hope they will not be angry with my well-meant endeavours, but take kindly what is intend∣ed only for their good.</P>

<P>ATTEND, ye young men, who are about to enter into trade, for to you I write my story. I was bound apprentice to a respectable tradseman in Cheap∣side. My master, Mr. Vincent, had acquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>very f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r character, whilst he was making a comfortable for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne. His wise was a dressy, flashy woman, who liked visiting and jaunting more than taking care of her family, whilst my master was plodding late at night in the compt∣ing house, Mrs. Vincent and her daughters were either making parties abroad, or giving entertainments at home. As we kept no footman, I was allowed when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop was shut, to run from one public place to another to call a coach, to bring Mrs. Vincent and her daugh∣ters home. To lounging about the purlieus of a play∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se I owe my ruin. I was generally allowed to be a handsome well-made young man; this unfortunately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew upon me the notice of a set of those wretched wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, who nightly croud the theatres; I should have been delighted with the notice they took of me, had not my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ty whispered me that Miss Vincent was in love with me. This suspicion was sully confirmed to me by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Porter, an elder apprentice, but for whose wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I might have lived happily, and died virtuoustly.</P>
<P>The idea that Miss Vincent was in love with me at once completed me for the coxcomb: I now neglected my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ess, and to dress out my person became the on∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> object of my thoughts: I began to commit little frauds on my master, in order to obtain money to dress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for ever since Potter had laughed me out of my religion every principle of moral honesty sat loosely up∣on me.</P>
<P>I am sorry to say the holy Sabbath in our family was only disdinguished from other days by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing of
<PB N="19" REF="035296_0113_1001BFC41C8047A8"/>the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my master spent the greater part of it in pos∣ting his books, and my mistress and her daughters were either dressing to go abroad, or else to receive company at home. We young me indeed were sent to church; but as we had no examples set us by the heads of the family going thither themselves, Potter and I generally hired a gig and dashed away from one tea-drinking place to another; these scenes soon made me lose all respect for virtue and religion. It was at the Dog and Duck I first saw the infamous Miss West; she was many years older than myself: her person was as love∣ly as her heart was wicked. She was no sooner infor∣med that I was to come into possession of 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the day I came of age, than she made use of all her deceitful arts to ensnare both my soul and body, as she often promp∣ted me to defraud my master to supply her extrava∣gance. My attachment to Miss Vincent was now on 01 the decline, for Miss West had so far wrought upon my vanity, as to make me belive that so handsome a young fellow as I was, should look higher than a tradesman's daughter, from that moment I treated Miss Vincent with the most marked neglect, although I saw my conduct cut her to the heart; yet, at the same time was I base enough to borrow money of her, which I wantonly squandered away on Miss West.</P>
<P>When Potter's apprenticeship expired, instead of im∣proving his fortune by throwing it into trade, he plung∣ed at once into all the vices of the town. He possessed a plausible kind of prate, which caused him to be ap∣pointed Chairman to our Club, which was chiefly com∣posed of clerks and apprentice boys. Potter's principal excellence consisted in singing a merry song, telling an indecent story, and teaching his heaters to laugh at mo∣rality, and set all religion at defiance; ser religion, he maintained, was only an old woman's tale, invented by cunning heads to keep children and fools in order.</P>
<P>There was an honest old porter lived in our family,
<PB N="20" REF="035296_0114_1001BFC626671DA0"/>who for some time had set himself to watch my conduct, and at length he made such a faithful report of it to my master, that he gave up my indentures, and turned me out of doors.</P>
<P>I was too much delighted with my liberty to feel any sense of shame at the means by which I obtained it.</P>
<P>I was sorry, however, to break off entirely with Miss Vincent, for I still had a lurking affection for her; I told Potter so: his inventive genius soon laid a plan whereby I might get her into my power, and take a complete revenge on her whole family at the same time. This was by writing her a letter, setting forth the vio∣lence of my love, the unmerited disgrace I had received from her family, and at the same time requesting her to grant me a private meeting, in order that I might jus∣tify my conduct to her, as otherwise I feared the vio∣lence of my passion would drive me to a fit of despair.</P>
<P>This poor imprudent girl met me at the time and place appointed. I will not here shock my readers with rela∣ting the vile stratagems I made use of to complete the ruin of this young lady, nor the tremendous oaths I swore to repair her wrongs by marriage, as soon as I came of age, which would be in a very few months; this somewhat abated her sorrow for the very indiscreet step she had taken.</P>
<P>The day I became of age, I went down into the coun∣try. My friends having been apprized of my profligate life, received me very coldly. I practised the deepest hypocrisy on my good mother, to make her believe I was quite a reformed man, in order to wheedle her out of a sum of money, telling her at the same time, I had an im∣mediate prospect of entering into a very profitable con∣cern with a partner of great responsibility, if I could but increase my capital.</P>
<P>"Frank," said she, with firmness, "there is no trus∣ting to your promises; as long as your conduct deserved my love, you ever sound me an indulgent mother; but you shall never have cause to say, I acted towards you
<PB N="21" REF="035296_0115_1001BFC88AF4E6B0"/>like a weak woman, by robbing my virtuous children, to supply the wanton extravagance of a profligate son.—Your wicked life, Frank, has nearly broken my heart, but it shall not shake my justice." The well known steadiness of my mother's temper convinced me at once she was not further to be imposed upon by the fallacy of my arguments.</P>
<P>As soon as I had settled my business, I returned to London to Miss Vincent, who had waited for me with the utmost patience, fully expecting I was come to ful∣fil my promise of marriage to her. "I can struggle with want, dear Frank," said she, "but I will never consent to live in shame." Nothing I am certain hardens the heart like vice, for although this poor young creature was brought into a very trying situation by the prospect of her soon becoming a mother, I swore I would never make <HI>her</HI> my <HI>wife,</HI> who had disgraced herself by living with me as a <HI>mistress.</HI> On hearing this, in all the ten∣der agonies of grief, she urged me to repair the wrongs I had done her, reminding me at the same time, of the wicked arts I had made use of to beguile her of her innocence, and then with clasped hands and streaming eyes, she threw herself on her knees before me, beseech∣ing me to pity the agonies which rent her soul, yet still my hardened nature was untouched by her sorrow; again I solemnly swore I never would marry her.</P>
<P>Through excess of grief she fainted away, in which pitiable state I left her to the care of a servant, went out and spent the rest of the evening with Miss West, whose flinty heart turned into ridicule the sorrowful tale I related to her.</P>
<P>On returning to my lodgings the next morning, I was informed Miss Vincent had left them without leaving behind her the least information where she was to be found, and much did I rejoice when I heard it, that she had taken herself off so quietly.</P>
<P>I now lavished my money as though it would never have an end. By all I was esteemed the most noble spi∣rited
<PB N="22" REF="035296_0116_1001BFCEDF7957B0"/>fellow in the world, and even little wits would be silent in my presence, because I was sure to pay for the wine upon which they were to riot. My cash at length beginning to run low, as I had been all along drawing from the principal, I advised with Potter how to get furnished with future supplies. He advised the gaming table as a never failing friend, saying, it had long since been the only resource from whence he derived his sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>I took his advice and for some months was so success∣ful, that I began to dash away in higher life at the West end of the town.—I bought an elegant phaeton, which I drove every Sunday in Hyde Park, with Miss West by my side. One day as I was driving furiously through Temple Bar, I had the misfortune to overturn a poor man with a heavy load on his back; on his get∣ting up, I perceived him to be Mr. Vincent's old por∣ter, to whom I formerly owed my disgrace.</P>
<P>"Ah! ah! what, is it you young hopeful?" cried he, on seeing to whom he owed his misfortune, "well, he must needs go whom the devil drives; thy prancing nags may die a natural death, master Frank, but veri∣ly, I think 'tis more than thou wilt, boy, for if thou diest in thy shoes, the gallows will be robbed of its due. What is become of poor Patty Vincent, thou profli∣gate dog, hast thou broken her heart, as thou hast that of her poor afflicted parents!"</P>
<P>The sudden recollection of that unfortunate girl cau∣sed such a swimming in my head, that the reins dropt from my hands, my horses took fright, and it was al∣most a miracle that I get home alive.—The porter's words had made such an impression on my mind that I could not shake them off. Soon after, Potter calling upon me, I told him of my interview with the old por∣ter, and also the effect it had on me. "Frank," said he, "if a fellow of thy spirit can be thus easily over∣come by qualms of conscience, let us instantly adjourn to the tavern, since good wine is the best remedy in the
<PB N="23" REF="035296_0117_1001BFD427033690"/>world to drown all uneasy recollections in." I gladly accepted his proposal: we called a coach, and off we went. He no sooner saw my spirits inflamed with wine, than he drew me to the gaming table, where, before morning, I lost every shilling I had in the world; I ap∣plied to Potter to lend me 50 guineas, as he had won more than 200 of me.</P>
<P>Laughing heartily, he told me, it had ever been a maxim with him, never to lend his money to a man who had not prudence to keep his own; "but, harkee, Frank," said he, "I'll give thee my best advice gratis: such a noble spirited young fellow as thou art, needs ne∣ver be at a loss for money while he can snap a trigger, and the highway is left open for him to practise upon. Men who follow the same course of pleasure, are the last people in the world to help each other in the hour of distress; virtuous men, Frank, only feel for the wants of their friends, and they alone find pleasure in reliev∣ing them." He then whistled himself off.</P>
<P>When I got home, I sat revolving in my mind how to get myself out of my present difficulties, when in a fatal moment, Satan whispered in my ears the word FORGERY. At first I started at the thought, but my poverty was clamorous, my pride startled at disgrace, although my conscience did not shudder at the crime. I know I could copy Mr. Vincent's hand exactly, I snatched up the pen to draw a bill upon him for 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but a cold shivering seizing me, it dropt from my fin∣gers, a strong sense of my guilt now overtook me, I tore what I had written to pieces, and exclaimed, I am a free man again; and for a moment felt thankful that I had been enabled to resist the violence of temptation. I sat pondering, however, how I should maintain myself; again I was assaulted with the dread of poverty, and again I snatched up the pen, drew the fatal bill, and in∣stantly went and got it accepted.</P>
<P>But the moment I sought to take rest at night on my pillow, I felt as if all the horrors of hell had seized me.
<PB N="24" REF="035296_0118_1001BFD865F56070"/>I jumped out of bed in my sleep, and was going to throw myself out of the window, having dreamt that I was apprehended, the people of the house, awakened by my cries, ran into the room, concluding some villains had broken in, and were going to murder me.</P>
<P>I never afterwards went into the street, but my fears told me I was the subject of conversation of all the peo∣ple I met. Once I happened to hear one man say to another, pointing to a third, "that's he, that's he," I took to my heels, concluding that I myself was meant, and ran from one street to another, without knowing whither, till my sight failed me, and, through loss of breath, I dropped down in a fit. Some humane people however, recovered me, and put me into a hackney coach which carried me home.</P>
<P>One day, a sudden gust of wind blew open my cham∣ber door, again I concluded the officers were coming to take me. Snatching up the poker to defend myself, I swore I would not be taken alive, when turning about suddenly, I caught a glimpse of myself in the glass, my eyes looked wild, my lips quivered, my jaws dropped, my teeth chattered, and my body shook, as though the last agonies of death were upon me. On finding I was once more become the dupe of my fears, my spirits ral∣lied again, I dressed and went to the play; there I met Sally West, whom I had not seen for some weeks; for, to say the truth, I dreaded to meet an old acquaintance from the time I committed the forgery: after the play, we went off together to sup at a tavern▪ we had not been there a quarter of an hour when she made an ex∣cuse for quitting the room; in about ten minutes she returned to me, expressing in the tenderest terms the satisfaction she had to see me again.</P>
<P>We were, as I believed, just going to set down to supper, when the waiters came in followed by two of Sir John Fielding's men. Immediately with the great∣est coolness, Miss West arose, and laying her hand on my shoulder exclaimed, "the Philistines be upon thee
<PB N="25" REF="035296_0119_1001BFE12B7FB630"/>Sampson. Gentlemen," continued she to the officers, "this is my good friend Mr. Francis H—of whom you have been sometime in search. Perhaps, Frank," continued she, "you do not know that your forgery is discovered, and that 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> reward is offered for taking you, when I left the room just now it was to write a note to these gentlemen, signifying to them where you were to be found; I see you are terrified, but hear me for the last time perhaps, and you will the less wonder at my conduct. Early in life, Frank, I was betrayed to ruin, by a base designing man; my reputation once blasted, I was deserted by all the virtuous part of my own sex; by having had examples always before my eyes, I soon became hardened in sin and abandoned to shame. I have lately contracted debts; if they are not immediately discharged I shall be sent to a jail; this jail I know not how to avoid but by sending you thither in my stead; as the reward offered for taking you will just set me free from my creditors."</P>
<P>I was struck motionless with terror, and fainted away on the officers approaching to tie my hands behind me; nor had I the least recollection of what passed, till I found myself safe locked in my prison. About a week after this, the keeper came to tell me, there was a pri∣soner lately brought in who was very desirous of seeing me, and as she appeared an object of great pity, he offer∣ed to conduct me to her. On entering the chamber, I saw a young woman very shabbily dressed, lying on a miserable bed, in a very weak condition.</P>
<P>"Dost thou not know me, Frank?" said she, in a hol∣low broken voice. Hast thou lost all recollection of Patty Vincent." I felt instantly as if struck with a thunderbolt. "Merciful Heaven!" cried I, falling on my knees by the bedside; "I am unable to bear the punishment my crimes have brought upon me! O God of mercy support my troubled soul." She kindly urged me to be comforted, said she wished not to see me to re∣proach me for the evils I had brought upon her, but on∣ly
<PB N="26" REF="035296_0120_1001BFE582F051C0"/>to tell me with her last breath that she forgave me.—"It is not an hour since, Frank," continued she, "that I heard you was my fellow-prisoner, and what is worse at my father's suit. I will not reproach you, Frank, I tell you again, for all the miseries you have brought up∣on me, because you are a prisoner and in chains. If my breath will hold out, I will endeavor to give you a short history of myself since we parted. On your refu∣sing to make me your lawful wife, I quitted your lodg∣ings, resolving by my labor to eat the bread of industry rather than follow a course of vice for a wretched sub∣sistence. I hired a garret in Holborn, where I applied for needle-work, and soon obtained it. In about three months after our separation, my infant came into the world, I sold my cloaths for my support during my con∣finement, but that resource soon failed me. My health and strength declined, I was seized with a constant fe∣ver and cough, and quite unable to supply the scanty morsel of bread for the day, yet resolved to die rather than afflict my dear parents with the knowledge of my misery. At length being too weak to labor, I contract∣ed several small debts, for which I was seized and brought hither. I have however since been prevailed upon to send my poor half-furnished baby to my parents, hoping they will afford her that bread which her dying mother dared not ask for herself." Observing I was speechless with agony, poor Patty went on. "I did not wish to see you, Frank, to afflict you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish only to warn you with my dying breath to repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the evil of your ways, and humble your soul before God.

Frank!
<PB N="27" REF="035296_0121_1001A30C62059070"/>it is far safer to die a penitent in a jail, than to live in a palace, with a heart untouched by God's grace."</P>
<P>Here she was interrupted by the unexpected entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent. O ye, who shall hereafter read my story, drop a tear of pity at the agony I now endured! They no sooner beheld their child, than each by turns tenderly embraced her, assuring her of their forgiveness, and gently chid her, for having concealed herself so long, adding, that as a penitent child they would most gladly have received her, though they would have shunned her, if they found her living in prosperous wickedness. She thanked them and said,</P>
<P>"Mourn not for my death, my dearest parents, but rather rejoice that I die penitent for my transgression, and since I have received your blessing and forgiveness I have but one favor more to ask in life, which is, that you, my kind father, will extend your pity towards that young man," pointing to me. "O save him, if possible, from an ignominious death, and remember, that my child is also his. My business in life is done, and now, O Heavenly Father! receive my spirit, and pardon my sin, through Jesus Christ my Redeemer." Here her speech failed her, and after a few convulsive struggles she expired.</P>
<P>Great Heaven! is there any punishment for me to suffer hereafter beyond what I endured at the mo∣ment? A dead silence succeeded for some time, my groans only were heard. As soon as Mr. Vincent had somewhat recovered the shock, he raised himself from the body of his child, and spoke to me as follows:</P>
<P>"Behold, O young man, the calamities which thy crimes have brought on my family! Behold, my depart∣ed child lying on the bosom of her fainting mother; yet I am not insensible to the agonies which rend thy soul, and sorry am I to add to them, by telling thee, thy ex∣cellent mother went out of her senses, on hoaring thou hadst committed a crime, by which thou hadst forfeited
<PB N="28" REF="035296_0122_1001BFEAB52CEE28"/>thy life to the laws of thy country. O Frank! Frank! what deep distress can one profligate child bring on whole families! Thy crimes, alas! have brought on thy own destruction, for I fear it will not be in my power to be∣friend thee on thy trial, much as I am disposed to do it in consideration of thy relations. Too late, Frank, thou must now see, how fatal an excessive love of plea∣sure must prove to a young tradesman. Honest industry is generally a sure road to wealth; as a sober, religious life is to happiness. To thy cost thou must already have experienced, that the wicked can have no depen∣dence upon each other, since thou art betrayed and brought to shame, by those very friends who first led thy youth astray."</P>
<P>"O Sir," cried I, "few and evil have been my days, but the great God above, who knoweth the secrets of all hearts, can alone judge of the sorrows of mine; it is not, Sir, the punishment of death which I fear, but the just vengeance of offended Heaven, which must follow it; for though a very young man, I am a very old sin∣ner. Alas! my dear, and honored mother, is it then true, that the crimes of your own child have robbed you of your senses? And yet the merciful hand of God has hitherto withheld his vengeance from striking me dead. To whom shall I fly for mercy and pity in my distress? From the law I cannot expect it, and from the offended Majesty of high Heaven I dare not hope it, since my present punishment is but the certain wages of my sin." Here I am told I fell into strong convul∣sion fits, and in that condition was conveyed to my cell.</P>
<P><HI>Written the night before my execution.</HI></P>
<P>It is a month since I was put on my trial, and my guilt being fully proved by the court, I am condemned to hang by the neck till I am <HI>Dead! Dead! Dead!</HI></P>
<P>O, ye thoughtless young men who have forsaken the God of Heaven to follow after the enticing pleasures of
<PB N="29" REF="035296_0123_1001A30AD9103E98"/>this world, attend to my words, as to those of a man speaking to you from the grave, since the dawn of that day is now breaking on the world, in which I shall be numbered with the dead. Although, at the instant I write, I am in all the prime of youth, and all the vigor of health, I shall this day die a just victim to the broken laws; and my precious soul may be consigned over to everlasting torments, unless the great judge of all things will be graciously pleased to accept my sorrow for my sin, through a gracious Redeemer.</P>
<P>My days are numbered, my hours are few, and the solemn tolling bell will soon be summoning me to meet my God in judgment. The convulsive struggles of death are already upon me before I reach the gallows, whereon I must shortly hang as a warning spectacle to gaping thousands, and from whence I must shoot the great gulph which parts TIME from ETERNITY!</P>
<P>O, blessed Lord, have mercy on my soul!</P>
<P>The above story was found in the young man's pock∣et after his execution.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF POOR TRICKET, THE <HI>GAMESTER.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slewing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow he first lost his place by gaming, and then had well nigh been the death of his wife through the same cause, and how, lastly, his gaming was the occasion of his being transported as a convict to Bota∣ny Bay.</HEAD>
<P>"I CAN'T, for my life, imagine (said Mr. Smith to his opposite neighbor, Mr. Tomson) what those fellows can be about on the top of my house.—They have been these two days employed there in re∣pairing the damage done by the high wind t'other night; a job which I think might have been done in a very few hours." Step over the way to my door," said Tomson "and I will presently explain to you why the job is so long in hand." Smith did so—" turn about and look up," said Tomson, "and you will see the two men sitting over against each other on the ridge of your house."—"Why they are playing at cards!" said Smith—"no wonder my business is so long in doing." Away went Smith to the master bricklayer to com∣plain of his men. The master was very angry, as he well might be, and dismissed the idle fellows from his service; and as he made known the story, the men found no one willing to employ them, so they had full leisure for their gaming, and Betsworth lost all his money with Tricket—Betsworth's wife in vain asked him for cash, provisions were scarce, and they had lived on short commons several days.</P>
<P>On Saturday Betsworth had no wages to receive, never∣theless,
<PB N="31" REF="035296_0125_1001BFF2563AFE88"/>he desired his wife would get a bit of meat for a hot Sunday's dinner; "for" said he, "we have lived hardly enough this week, and I shall ask my friend Tricket to eat a bit with us." The wife said nothing, but when her husband and Tricket came in to dinner on Sunday, she laid the cloth, and set upon the table a dish with a cover. "What hast thou got under thy co∣ver, wife?" said Betsworth, "something nice I hope." "As good as I could get," said the wife, "had you brought me money you should have had something bet∣ter." Upon this he lifted up the cover and behold! the dish contained nothing but some dirty old cards scatter∣ed about it! "Is this," said Betsworth, "what you pro∣vide for me and my friend?" "It is all that you and your friend have left us," said she; "I have nothing to eat myself, and these are the only tools you work with to provide for my maintenance and your own." "Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the cards," said Betsworth, "they have been the ruin of me: forgive me wife, I deserve a more bitter reproof." "Tricket," added he, "my poor Molly has served us rightly enough; for my part, I am resolved to go to my master to-morrow, confess my fault, and try to get his work again; and I hope God will pardon me for the distress I have brought upon my family by my love of gaming; and that he will mercifully strengthen me to resist every temptation to return to such a horrid practice."—Tricket did not relish the jest, but went surlily out of the house. Betsworth, however, is said to have taken a hint from this little trick of his wife, and, as far as I have heard, he has never since been found amongst the Gamesters.</P>
<P>I must now proceed to tell you something more of Tricket, who continued his evil practices, and who is the only one of these two Gamesters whose history I mean to speak of any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035296_0126_1001BFF965D30F48"/>
Having lost his former gull whom he tried once or twice to draw into another game, by saying that the man wanted spirit, Tricket happened to light upon a second brother gamester, whom he hoped to drain as he had done Betsworth; but either through a sad run of ill-luck, or, as I rather think, by his being not a lit∣tle cheated, he soon lost every farthing of his former boo∣ty, and he had nothing now left for him to stake at the next gaming party, except what little he could get by stripping his poor wife of the earnings of her hard la∣bor.—She had two children of four and five years of age, for whom, as well as herself, she contri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to get bread by taking in washing.</P>
<P>She bore with patience her husband's spending all he got upon his own pleasures, and leaving her to shift for herself; but when he came home and tore from her what she had worked so hard for, she could not help weeping and complaining, though her complaints were mild and far from the language of scolding; but her brutal hus∣band, instead of being moved by her tears, only made them a pretence for running from her to the ale-house; "since," as he said, "he could not have comfort at home."</P>
<P>One of the families for which she washed would of∣ten carelessly make her wait a month or two for the payment of her bills, instead of discharging them week∣ly, when she brought home the linen. This is a cruel inconsideratency, and very contrary to the merciful spi∣rit of the law of God, which forbids to keep back the hire of the laborer. The truth is, persons whose only support is hard labor, can seldom do more than live from hand to mouth, and whilst their pay is kept back by a thoughtless customer, they are likely enough to be starving for the want of it.</P>
<P>It happened that she had just received a washing bill of six weeks standing, which she had long been sighing
<PB N="33" REF="035296_0127_1001A31AF9D5C170"/>for, and was counting her money, when her husband came home in a terrible humour, declared he had not a farthing in the world, and laid his violent hands on this money, every shilling of which he carried off.—She screamed after him, begging that he would leave her some of it at least, or how could she get bread for her children? But he was quickly out of hearing, and hastily returned to his play-mate, who waited for him at the ale-house. Tricket's cruelty struck his wife to the heart; she sat down in dumb despair and could not ease her full heart by weeping; the children looked up in her face with terror, and soon began to cry, and to tell her they were hungry; this gave a free passage to her tears; she hugged them both to her breast, and told them that they should have all the food their cruel father had left them: she brought out the remainder of her loaf, and divided it between them; for her part, she could swallow none.</P>
<P>By being obliged to trust her customers, she had been reduced to borrow a little from her landlady, and she owed some rent besides, so that she was ashamed to ap∣ply to her again, and she had not six-pence in the world to supply food, or to buy soap for her washing. He who should assist her was her worst enemy, and, careless of her wants, took from her the fruits of her industry to throw it away in gaming and drinking.</P>
<P>This barbarous treatment hurt her the more because, with all his faults, she retained more affection for him than he deserved; and had often cheerfully supplied his extravagance with a share of what she got, when she could do it without starving herself and her children.—But now provisions were so dear that she found it not easy to get necessaries even by working early and late at her laborious business. No money could she get from her husband, and this day his antagonist had refused to play with him any longer upon tick; and the alehouse-keeper,
<PB N="34" REF="035296_0128_1001C000499E3FF0"/>at whose house this gaming commonly went on, would draw no more beer without present pay. His character was become so bad, that he could not get em∣ployed when necessity would have urged him to work. In this situation he had come home desperate and pro∣voked at his ill-fortune, when he found his wife with two guineas and a good deal of silver before her. The sight of this money renewed his hopes, and his eager∣ness for trying once more to recover his losings. With this only object in view, he flew like a vulture on his prey, and without a thought of the distressful state of those who should have been dear to him as his life, snatched from them all the means of subsistence. Thus does gaming harden the heart and swallow up every good affection! whilst the hateful passions of avarice and envy are continually fed and strengthened by it!</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Tricket, cold and fasting, put her chil∣dren to bed and, sat weeping over them whilst her husband spent his hours in greedy wishes, hopes, and fears; in rage, in oaths, and curses, over his cards, with the tankard at his side, often drained by the thirsty pas∣sion burning in his stomach, and raging in his mind.—At past midnight he came staggering home, and found his wife sitting up for him, pale and shivering, and her face swelled with weeping.—"I thought you had left us for good and all," said she, "left us to perish; how could you be so barbarous as to rob me of all, and leave me without a penny in the house?—I beseech you to give me back some of that money, which was all I had in the world, unless you do indeed desire to see me and your children die with want." "If that was your <HI>all,</HI>" he replied, "<HI>die you must;</HI> for it is every penny gone, and more after it than I shall ever be able to pay." So saying, he turned his pockets inside out, to shew her they were perfectly empty. At this sight the poor wo∣man, whose spirits were before nearly exhausted with grief and fasting, fell in a fainting fit at his feet; as he
<PB N="35" REF="035296_0129_1001C0047AA20280"/>had never seen her so before he thought she was dead, and alarmed the house with his cries; though he was much in liquor, and his mind almost distracted, yet the idea of having been the cause of her death struck him with horror. The children, awakened by his out-cry, started up, and seeing her on the floor, cried, "Mam∣my! Mammy!" with all their might.</P>
<P>This dreadful noise awakened both the landlady, who slept above stairs, and also a widow lady, who lodged on the first floor, but before either of these could run down stairs, Tricket was at their doors, crying in a hor∣rible tone, "My wife! my wife! come to her if you have any pity! I have killed her! help! help!" He then ran back, and found her lying where he had left her, and the two children on the ground with her, kis∣sing her cold hands and face, sobbing and drowning her with their tears. The lady and landlady reached Trick∣et's room at the same instant, and looked with amaze∣ment on this wretched groupe, whilst the man cried out, "See! see! what I have done!—I have murdered my wife!" "Sure you could not be such a monster, said the lady, "how have you murdered her? where is her wound? help to raise her up, and let us see the hurt." They then lifted her up, and perceived returning life in her. "Where is your hurt my poor dear creature?" said the landlady; "where did that inhuman villain strike you?" The poor woman looked wildly: "what do you mean?" said she, "he did not strike me, tho' I almost wish he had to the heart." Her husband, now, with the most lively joy and gratitude, thanked God that she was alive, and on his knees begged her for∣giveness. She assured him, as well as her weakness would allow, that she forgave him all.</P>
<P>The good women now hastened to make a fire, and to warm her bed, for they found she shivered violently; when they had put her into it, the lady brought her a glass of warm wine and water, some of which she pre∣vailed
<PB N="36" REF="035296_0130_1001C00664D926B8"/>on her to swallow.—Tricket, whose anguish had taken off his intoxication, put his children again into their little bed; he gazed upon them and their mother by turns; whilst his heart was wrung with the sense of their wants and his own wickedness. His wife fell asleep soon after the refreshment she had taken; but in a few hours awoke in a burning fever.—Tricket watched by her side: when he felt her hand and head as hot as fire, his fears returned, and he ran out of the house to fetch an apothecary; though he recollected that he had nothing to pay for help, or even necessary food for her: however, he went into the street, taking a club stick in his hand, and had not gone half way to the apothecary's, when, on turning a corner, he saw a gentleman, walking alone before him. Tricket at that moment looking round the street, saw no creature near. Suddenly it darted into his mind, that he might now get bread for his wife and children, and that he could escape home again before any one could detect him; he stopt not for recollection, but striking the gentleman with all his force on the back of his head, felled him to the ground, and was rifling his pockets, when a watch∣man, turning the same corner Tricket had done, ran up, winding his rattle as he ran.</P>
<P>Tricket tried to escape; but the rattle brought watch∣men from so many quarters, that he was soon secured; whilst some of them conveyed him to the round-house, others assisted the gentleman to rise; having been only stunned, he soon recovered his speech, and directed the men to lead him to his house, which was not far off.—There they asked him whether he was robbed? and on examining his pockets, he found that he had lost his watch, and his purse, both of which he particularly de∣scribed. The watch he could swear to, if he saw it; and he told the colour of the purse, and what money it contained, of which he gave the watchmen a memo∣randum.—They then returned to the round-house,
<PB N="37" REF="035296_0131_1001C00B4F7EE370"/>where, on searching the prisoner, the watch and purse were found upon him.—He would not answer any of their questions, but remained in gloomy silence.</P>
<P>When the day was more advanced, they carried him before a Justice of the Peace, and gave in their infor∣mation. Tricket was now obliged to speak; and see∣ing clearly that he must be convicted, he burst into an agony of grief, and confessed the whole; but he plead∣ed the distress to which his wife and family were redu∣ced, which alone, he said, "had led him to this rash action:" and he repeatedly observed, that since he was driven to it by <HI>necessity,</HI> he hoped that both his Wor∣ship and the Gentleman would let him go: and he protested that, till the fatal moment when he saw the Gentleman, and thought he might rescue his wife from death, and his children from starving, he had never en∣tertained a thought of committing such a crime.</P>
<P>In answer to this speech of Tricket, the Justice (who was well acquainted with Tricket's whole character and history) remarked, "that although the crime in question, was committed on the sudden, and though it arose out of the man's distress, yet, that distress had been brought upon him evidently by gaming." "My friend," said he, "you have gone from one step to ano∣ther, as almost every other person has done, that has been brought before me. First, when you were in a good place you were negligent of your work through the love of gaming; and when for this cause you lost your employment, you then took to gambling more desperately than ever, through a necessity which you brought upon yourself. Your necessities next led you to take from your wife her little earnings, and when you had thus nearly driven her to distraction, then it was that you began to feel for the wants of your wife and children; and thus you were driven by another ne∣cessity of your own making to rob on the highway for her relief.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="035296_0132_1001C00FA1DD8670"/>
"I cannot help therefore tracing your crime entirely to your gaming, for it is this which has brought you into temptation; and no man can tell when he has once trespassed, as you have done, to what lengths the De∣vil at one time or other may suddenly drive him. In∣stead, therefore, of excusing yourself, let me advise you to consider how happy for you it is, that the gentleman whom you struck is not killed; for in that case you would have been brought before me, not for the rob∣bery and assault only, but for murder.</P>
<P>Poor Tricket was much affected by these remarks, and did not utter a word more in the way of excuse for his crime; but he begged and prayed the Gentleman, for his dear wife's sake, not to hang him. Upon which the Justice interfered, and told Tricket, that "as to the nature of his punishment, that must depend upon circumstances that would appear on the trial;" and he immediately bound the Gentleman over to prosecute.</P>
<P>While this scene was passing at the Justice's, poor Mrs. Tricket was left in a doleful case. She was told by her husband, when he went away, that he was only going to run to the apothecary's, in order to bring some help to her, and that he would be back instantly; two hours passed and she heard nothing of him: she began to suspect something dreadful, and her mind gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w so agitated, that her brain seemed on fire, and her senses forsook her.—It happened that a gentleman who had been present at the Justice's (having been drawn thi∣ther by the croud) called, from motives of humanity, in the course of the day to inquire into the state of Tric∣ket's family; and he was the first person who brought intelligence of the horrible event that had taken place. As Mrs. Tricket was so ill, the only step that could be taken at present, was to bring the apothecary to her; who, by laying on a blister, and giving her proper me∣dicines, abated the fever, and took off the delirium: but as her reason returned, her anxiety about her hus∣band
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0133_1001C0011C9E3671"/>returned also, and she incessantly begged to know what was become of him. Still it was thought that the dreadful truth must not be told her, lest it should bring back her distraction; and it was not till three days af∣ter, when the apothecary declared her to be much bet∣ter, that the sad condition of her husband was revealed to her.</P>
<P>No sooner was this affecting discovery made to Mrs. Tricket, than she grew eager to get out of bed, to go to her husband in the prison; but her weakness made it impossible.—It was with great difficulty that she was kept in the house after she was able to rise; and the first moment that she could extort from the apothecary permission to stir out, she put herself into a coach (for she had not strength to walk) and leaving her children in the care of her humane landlady, arrived at the pri∣son. The sight of her threw Tricket into an agony, yet he was glad to see her alive, and by degrees was soothed and comforted by her kindness and affection.—She entreated him with many tears, to make his peace with God by sincere repentance, and to trust in his mercy for forgiveness. She then, through her natural fondness and partiality for her husband, endeavored to find out some circumstances of mitigation; and parti∣cularly remarked, "that since it was his affection for her and for his starving family, that had put him on this rash action, she hoped that when the trial came on, the Judge would shew mercy to him." "Oh! If that could be," said Tricket, "I think I should never again fall into my former vices; but I dare not hope it; the rob∣bery is fully proved, and it is no thanks to me, as his worship very justly observed, that murder was not also the consequence of my villainous action; my trial soon comes on; prepare your mind for the sad sentence, and pray for me that I also may be prepared for a more aw∣ful trial after death." She now fell on her knees, and he knelt by her, and both implored forgiveness at
<PB N="40" REF="035296_0134_1001C01894F3EFF8"/>the throne of Grace, with such feelings of contrition, that they rose up, hoping that their prayers had been heard through the great Saviour of mankind: and their minds now became more calm and more resigned to the event, whatever it might be.</P>
<P>Tricket was convicted at the next assines on the clearest evidence, and sentenced to death; but some fa∣vorable circumstances in his case were reported to his Majesty by the Judge, and the sentence was in conse∣quence changed from death to transportation.</P>
<P>The fear of death at first made even Botany Bay ap∣pear a deliverance, but when he was to depart thither, bitter indeed was the affliction of his faithful wife; for since he had appeared a penitent, she had become so much endeared to him, that all his past injuries being quite forgotten, his leaving her was worse than death.</P>
<P>She was earnestly desirous to go with him, but find∣ing that she could not be allowed to take her children, she tho't it her duty not to forsake them; at least un∣der the present circumstances, nor indeed would he consent to her departure. The excellency of Mrs. Tricket's character was the occasion of raising her up many friends, who furnished her with work, and who assisted both in educating and apprenticing her chil∣dren.</P>
<P>Her mind was restored in some measure to peace and tranquillity; and she found that they who faithfully do their own duty, and put their trust in God are not for∣saken by him, however unhappy they may be in their outward circumstances.</P>
<P>Such is the sad story of poor Tricket, the Gamester! Let each reader lay to heart the dreadful consequences of Gambling; for by first bringing a man to want, it will harden his heart even against his most beloved wife and children; and who knows whether it may not also drive him to those criminal acts, for which his very life may be justly forfeited to the laws of his country.</P>

<HEAD>BETTY BROWN, THE St. GiLES's ORANGE GIRL: WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF Mrs. SPONGE, THE MONEY LENDER.</HEAD>
<P>BETTY Brown, the Orange Girl, was born nobo∣dy knows where, and bred nobody knows how. No girl in all the streets of London could drive a barrow more nimbly, avoid pushing against passengers more dexterously, or cry her "Fine China Oranges" in a shriller voice.—But then she could neither sew, nor spin, nor knit, nor wash, nor iron, nor read, nor spell. Betty had not been always in so good a situa∣tion as that in which we now describe her. She came into the world before so many good gentlemen and la∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es began to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern themselves so kindly that the poor might have a little learning. There was no charitable Society then, as there is now, to pick up poor friend∣less children in the streets, and put them into a good house, and give them meat, and drink, and lodging, and learning, and teach them to get their bread in an honest way into the bargain. Whereas, this now is often the case in London, blessed be God for all his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcies.</P>
<P>The longest thing that Betty can remember is, that she used to crawl up out of a night cellar, stroll about the streets, and pick cinders from the scavenger's carts. Among the ashes she sometimes found some ragged gauze and dirty ribbons; with these she used to dizen herself out and join the merry bands on the first of May. This was not however quite fair, as she did not law∣fully belong either to the female dancers who foot it gaily round the garland, or to the footy it be, who, on
<PB N="42" REF="035296_0136_1001C020D19841D8"/>this happy holiday, forget their whole years toil; she often, however, got a few scraps, by appearing to be∣long to both parties.</P>
<P>Betty was not an idle girl; she always put herself in the way of doing something.—She would run of er∣rands for the footmen, or sweep the door for the maid of any house where she was known; she would run and fetch some porter, and never was once known ei∣ther to sip a drop, or steal the pot. Her quickness and fidelity in doing little jobs, got her into favor with a lazy cook-maid, who was too apt to give away her master's cold meat and beer, not to those who were most in want, but to those who waited upon her, and did the little things which she ought to have done her∣self.</P>
<P>The cook, who found Betty a dextrous girl, soon employed her to sell ends of candles, pieces of meat and cheese, and lumps of butter, or any thing else she could crib from the house. These were all carried to her friend Mrs. Sponge, who kept a little shop, and a kind of eating house for poor-working people, not far from the Seven Dials. She also bought as well as sold many kind of second hand things, and was not scrupulous to know whether what she bought was honestly come by, provided she got it for a sixth part of what it was worth. But if the owner presumed to ask for its real value, she had sudden qualms of conscience, suspected the things were stolen, and gave herself airs of honesty, which often took in poor silly people, and gave her a sort of half reputation among the needy and the igno∣rant, whose friend she pretended to be.</P>
<P>To this artful woman Betty carried the cook's pil∣ferings, and as Mrs. Sponge would give no great price for these in money, the cook was willing to receive payment for her eatables in Mrs. Sponge's drinkables; for she dealt in all kinds of spirits. I shall only just re∣mark
<PB N="43" REF="035296_0137_1001C0240DEB1858"/>here, that one receiver, like Mrs. Sponge, makes many pilferers, who are t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pted to these petty thieve∣ries, by knowing how easy it is to dispose of them as such iniquitous houses.</P>
<P>Betty was faithful to both her employers, which is ex∣traordinary, considering the greatness of the tempta∣tion, and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter ignorance of good and evil. One day, she ventured to ask Mrs. Sponge if she could not as∣sist her to get into a more settled way of life. She told her, that when the rose in the morning, she never knew where she should lie at night, nor was she ever fare of a meal before hand. Mrs. Sponge asked her what she thought herself sit for. Betty with fear and trem∣bling, said, there was one trade for which she thought herself qualified, but she had not the ambition to look so high. It was far above her humble views. This was to have a barrow, and sell fruit, as several other of Mrs. Sponge's customers did, whom she had often looked at with envy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge was an artful woman. Bad as she was she was always aiming at something of a character, this was a great help to her trade. While she wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eenly to make every thing turn to her own profit, she had a false fawning way of seeming to do all she did out of pity and kindness to the distressed; and she seldom committed an extortion, but she tried to make the per∣son she cheated believe themselves highly obliged to her kindness. By thus pretending to be their friend, she gained their considence, and she grew rich herself whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they tho't she was only shewing favor to them. Va∣rious 07 were the arts she had of getting rich. The mo∣ney she got by grinding the poor, she spent in the most laxurious living; and, while she would haggle with her hungry customers for a farthing, she would spend pounds on the most costly delicacies for herself.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge, laying aside that haughty look and voice, well known to such as had the misfortune to be
<PB N="44" REF="035296_0138_1001C027C2CD9EF0"/>in her debt, put on the hypocritical smile and soft tone, which she always assumed when she meant to take in her dependents. "Betty" said she, "I am resolved to stand your friend. These are sad times to be sure.—Money is money now. Yet I am resolved to put you into a handsome way of living. You shall have a bar∣row, and well furnished too." Betty could not have felt more joy or gratitude, if she had been told that she should have a coach. "O, madam," said Betty, "It is impossible. I have not a penny in the world towards helping me to set up." "I will take care of that," said Mrs. Sponge; "only you must do as I bid you. You must pay me interest for my money. And you will, of course be glad also to pay so much every night for a nice hot supper which I get ready, quite out of kindness, for a number of poor working people. This wll be a great comfort for such a friendless girl as you, for my victuals and drink are the best; and my company the merriest of any house in all St. Giles's." Betty thought all this only so many more favors, and courtesying to the ground, said, "to be sure, Ma'am, and thank you a thousand times into the bargain."</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge knew what she was about. Betty was a lively girl, who had a knack at learning any thing; and so well looking through all her dirt and rags, that there was little doubts she would get custom. A bar∣row was soon provided, and five shillings was put into Betty's hands. Mrs Sponge kindly condescended to go to shew her how to buy the fruit, for it was a rule with this prudent gentlewoman, and one from which she ne∣ver departed, that no one should cheat but herself.—Betty had never possessed such a sum before.—She grudged to lay it out all at once, and was ready to fan∣cy she could live upon the capital. The crown, how∣ever, was laid out to the best advantage.—Betty was carefully taught in what manner to cry her Oranges: and received many useful lessons how to get off the bad
<PB N="45" REF="035296_0139_1001C029AFF8E628"/>with the good, and the stale with the fresh.—Mrs. Sponge also lent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few bad sixpences, for which she ordered her to bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me good ones at night. Betty stared. Mrs Sponge said, "Betty, those who would get money, must not be too nice about trifles. Keep one of these sixpences in your hand, and if an ignorant young customer gives you a good sixpence, do you im∣mediately slip it into your other hand, and give him the bad one, declaring that is the very one you have just received, and that you have not another sixpence in the world. You must also learn how to treat different sorts of customers. To some you may put off with safety, goods which would be quite unsaleable to others. Ne∣ver offer bad fruit, Betty, to those who know better: never waste the good on those who may be put off with worse; put good Oranges at top and the mouldy ones under."</P>
<P>Poor Betty had not a nice conscience, for she had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣er learnt that grand but simple rule of all moral obliga∣tion, "Never do that to another which you would not have another do to you."—She set off with her bar∣row as proud and as happy as if she had been set up in the finest shop in Covent Garden. Betty had a sort of natural good nature, which made her unwilling to im∣pose, but she had no principle which told her it was a sin. She had such good success, that when night came, she had not an Orange left. With a light heart, she drove her empty barrow to Mrs. Sponge's door. She went in with a merry face, and threw down on the coun∣ter every farthing she had taken, "Betty" said Mrs. Sponge, "I have a right to it all, as it was got by my money. But I am too generous to take it.—I will therefore only take sixpence for this day's use of my five shillings. This is a most reasonable interest, and I will lend you the same sum to trade with to-morrow, and so on; you only paying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sixpence for the use of it every night which will be a great bargain to you.—
<PB N="46" REF="035296_0140_1001C02E0EA7F400"/>You must also pay me my price every night for your supper, and you shall have an excellent lodging above stairs; so you see every thing will now be provided for you in a genteel manner, through my generosity."</P>
<P>Poor Betty's gratitude blinded her so completely that she forgot to calculate the vast proportion which this generous benefactress was to receive out of her little gains. She thought herself a happy creature, and went in to supper with a number of others of her own class. For this supper, and for more porter and gin than she ought to have drank, Betty was forced to pay so high, that it eat up all the profits of the day, which added to the daily interest, made Mrs. Sponge a rich return for her five shillings.</P>
<P>Betty was reminded again of the gentility of her new situation, as she crept up to bed in one of Mrs. Sponge's garrets, five stories high. This loft, to be sure, was small, and had no window, but what it wanted in light was made up in company, as it had three L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, and thrice as many lodgers. Those gentry had one night in a drunken frolic, broke down the door, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppi∣ly had never been replaced; for since that time, the lodgers had died much seldomer of infectious dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pers. For this lodging, Betty paid twice as much to her good friend as she would have done to a stranger. Thus she continued, with great industry and a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing trade, as poor as on the first day, and not a bit nearer to saving money enough even to buy her a pair of shoes, though her feet were nearly on the ground.</P>
<P>One day, as Betty was driving her barrow through a street near Holborn, a lady from a window called out to her that she wanted some Oranges. While the ser∣vant went to fetch a plate, the lady entered into some talk with Betty, having been struck with her honest countenance and civil manner. She questioned her as to her way of life, and the profit of her trade—and Betty, who had never been so kindly treated before by
<PB N="47" REF="035296_0141_1001C03032368DA0"/>so genteel a person, was very communicative. She told her little history as far as she knew it, and dwelt much on the generosity of Mrs. Sponge, in keeping her in her house, and trusting her with so large a capital as five shillings. At first it sounded like a very good natured thing, but the lady, whose husband was one of the Jus∣tices of the new Police, happened to know more of Mrs. Sponge than was good, which led her to enquire still further. Betty owned, that to be sure it was not all clear profit, for that besides that the high price of the supper and bed ran away with all she got, she paid sixpence a day for the use of the five shillings. "And how long have you done this," said the lady? "About a year Madam."</P>
<P>The lady's eyes were at once opened. "My poor girl," said she, "do you know that you have already paid for that single five shillings the enormous sum of 7<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR>? I believe it is the most profitable five shillings Mrs. Sponge ever laid out." "Oh, no, Madam," said the girl, "that good gentlewoman does the same kind∣ness to ten or twelve other poor friendless creatures like me." "Does she so?" said the lady, "then I never heard of a better trade than this woman carries on, un∣der the mask of charity, at the expence of her poor fel∣low-creatures."</P>
<P>"But Madam," said Betty, who did not comprehend this lady's arithmetic, "what can I do? I now contrive to pick up a morsel of bread without begging or steal∣ing. Mrs. Sponge has been very good to me, and I don't see how I can help myself."</P>
<P>"I will tell you" said the lady. "If you will fol∣low my advice, you may not only maintain yourself ho∣nestly, but independently. Only oblige yourself to live hard for a little time, till you have saved five shillings out of your own earnings.—Give up that expensive supper at night, drink only one pint of porter, and no gin at all. As soon as you have scraped together the
<PB N="48" REF="035296_0142_1001C03902912E48"/>five shillings, carry it back to your false friend, and if you are industrious, you will at the end of the year have saved seven pounds ten shillings. If you can make a shift to live now, when you have this heavy interest to pay, judge how things will mend when your capital becomes your own.—You will put some cloaths on your back, and by leaving the use of spirits, and the company in which you drink them, your health, your morals, and your condition will mend."</P>
<P>The lady did not talk thus to save her money. She would gladly have given the girl the five shillings; but she thought it was beginning at the wrong end. She wanted to try her. Besides, she know there was much more pleasure as well as honor in possessing five shillings of one's own saving than of another's giving.—Betty promised to obey. She owned she got no good by the company or the liquor at Mrs. Sponge's. She promi∣sed that very night to begin saving the expence of the supper, and that she would not taste a drop of gin till she had the five shillings before hand. The lady, who knew the power of good habits, was contented with this, thinking, that if the girl could abstain, for a certain time, it would become easy to her.—She therefore at present said little about the sin of drinking.</P>
<P>In a very few weeks, Betty had saved up the five shillings.—She went to carry back this money with great gratitude to Mrs. Sponge. This kind friend be∣gan to abuse her most unmercifully. She called her many hard names not fit to repeat, for having forsaken the supper, by which she swore she got nothing at all; but as she had the charity to dress it for such beggarly wretches, she insisted they should pay for it whether they ate it or no. She also bro't in a heavy score for lodg∣ing, though Betty had paid for it every night, and giv∣en notice of her intending to quit her. By all these false pretences, she got from her not only her own five shillings, but all the little capital with which Betty was
<PB N="49" REF="035296_0143_1001C03CE3C1A7F0"/>going to set up for herself. As all was not sufficient to answer her demands, she declared she would send her to prison, but while she went to call a constable, Betty contrived to make off.</P>
<P>With a light pocket and a heavy heart, she went to the lady, and with many tears, told her sad story. The lady's husband, the Justice, condescended to listen to Betty's tale. He said Mrs. Sponge had long been up∣on his books as a receiver of stolen goods. Betty's evi∣dence strengthened his bad opinion of her.—"This pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty system of usury," said the gentleman, "may be thought trifling, but it will no longer appear so, if you reflect, that if one of these female sharpers possesses a capital of seventy shillings, or 3 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> with fourteen steady regular customers, she can realize a fixed income of 100 guineas a year. Add to this the influence such a loan gives her over these friendless creatures by com∣pelling them to eat at her house, or lodge or buy li∣quors, or by taking their pawns, and you will see the extent of the evil. I pity these poor victims: You, Betty, shall point out some of them to me. I will en∣deavor to open their eyes on their own bad manage∣ment. It is one of the greatest acts of kindness to the poor to mend their oeconomy, and to give them right views of laying out their little money to advantage.—These poor blinded creatures look no farther than to be able to pay this heavy interest every night, and to obtain the same loan on the same hard terms the next day. Thus are they kept in poverty and bondage all their lives; but I hope as many as hear of this will get on a better plan, and I shall be ready to help any who are willing to help themselves." This worthy Magis∣trate went directly to Mrs. Sponge's with proper offi∣cers, and he got to the bottom of many iniquities. He not only made her refund poor Betty's money, but committed her to prison for receiving stolen goods, and
<PB N="50" REF="035296_0144_1001A32DC419D5D0"/>various other offences, which may perhaps make the subject of another history.</P>
<P>Betty was now set up in trade to her hearts content. She had found the benefit of leaving off spirits, and she resolved to drink them no more.—The first fruits of this resolution was, that in a fortnight she bought her a new pair of shoes, and as there was now no deduc∣tion for interest or for gin, her earnings became consi∣derable. The lady made her a present of a gown and a hat, on the easy condition that she should go to church. She accepted the terms, at first, rather as an act of obe∣dience to the lady, than from a sense of a higher duty. But she soon began to go from a better motive. This constant attendance at church, joined to the instructions of the lady, opened a new world to Betty. She now heard, for the first time, that she was a sinner; that God had given a law which was holy, just, and good; that she had broken this law; had been a swearer, a sabbath-breaker, and had lived without God in the world. All this was sad news to Betty; she knew indeed that there were sinners, but she thought they were only to be sound in the prisons or at Botany Bay, or in those mournful carts which she had sometimes fol∣lowed with her barrow, with the unthinking croud, to Tyburn. She was most struck with the great truths revealed in the scripture, which were quite new to her. She was desirous of improvement, and said she would give up all the profits of her barrow, and go into the hardest service, rather than live in sin and ignorance.</P>
<P>"Betty," said the lady, "I am glad to see you so well disposed, and will do what I can for you. Your present way of life, to be sure, exposes you to much danger; but the trade is not unlawful in itself, and we may please God in any calling, provided it be not a dis∣honest one. In this great town there must be barrow-women to sell fruit. Do you, then, instead of forsa∣king your business, set a good example to those in it,
<PB N="51" REF="035296_0145_1001C04553217DD0"/>and shew them, that though a dangerous trade, it need not be a bad one. Till Providence points out some safer way of getting your bread, let your companions see, that it is possible to be good even in this. Your trade being carried on in the open street, and your fruit bought in an open shop, you are not so much obliged to keep sinful company as may be thought. Take a garret in an honest house, to which you may go home in safety at night. I will give you a bed and a few ne∣cessaries to furnish your room; and I will also give you a constant Sunday's dinner. A barrow woman, blessed be God and our good laws, is as much her own mis∣tress on Sundays as a Duchess; and the Church and the Bible are as much open tó her.—You may soon learn all that such as you are expected to know.—A barrow woman may pray as heartily morning and night, and serve God as acceptably all day, while she is car∣rying on her little trade, as if she had her whole time to spare.</P>
<P>To do this well, you must mind the following <HI>rules for Retail Dealers:</HI></P>
<P>Resist every temptation to cheat.</P>
<P>Never impose bad goods on false pretences.</P>
<P>Never put off bad money for good.</P>
<P>Never use prophane or uncivil language.</P>
<P>Never swear your goods cost so much, when you know it is false. By so doing you are guilty of two sins in one breath, a lie and an oath.</P>
<P>To break these rules, will be your chief temptation. God will mark how you behave under them, and will reward or punish you accordingly.—These tempta∣tions will be as great to you as higher trials are to higher people; but you have the same God to look to for strength to resist them as they have.—You must pray to him to give you this strength. You shall attend a Sunday School, where you will be taught these good
<PB N="52" REF="035296_0146_1001A332000C44A0"/>things, and I will promote you as you shall be found to deserve.</P>
<P>Poor Betty here burst into tears of joy and gratitude, crying out, "What, shall such a poor friendless crea∣ture as I be treated so kindly, and learn to read the word of God too? Oh, Madam, what a lucky chance brought me to your door." "Betty," said the lady, "what you have just said, shews the need you have of being better taught; there is no such thing as chance, and we offend God when we call that luck or chance which is brought about by his will and pleasure. None of the events of your life have happened by chance—but all have been under the direction of a good and kind Providence. He has permitted you to experience want and distress, that you might acknowledge his hand in your present comfort and prosperity. Above all, you must bless his goodness in sending you to me, not only because I have been of use to you in your worldly af∣fairs, but because he has enabled me to shew you the danger of your state from sin and ignorance, and to put you in a way to know his will and to keep his command∣ments.</P>

<HEAD>BLACK GILES, THE POACHER;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With some account of a Family who had rather live by their Wits than their Work.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of those great Moors in Somersetshire. Giles, to be sure, has been a sad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole family do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at the Mud Cottage with the broken windows, stuffed with dirty rags, just beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the house at a good distance by the ragged tiles on the roof, and the loose stones which are ready to drop out from the chimney; though a short ladder, a hod of mortar, and half an hour's leisure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, so he did not know the value of such useful sayings as, that "a tile in time saves nine."</P>
<P>Besides this, Giles fell into that common mistake, that a beggarly looking cottage, and filthy ragged chil∣dren raised most compassion, and of course drew most charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here; for it is neatness, house∣wifery, and a decent appearance, which draws the kindness of the rich and charitable, while they turn a∣way disgusted from filth and laziness; not out of pride, but because they see that it is next to impossible to
<PB N="54" REF="035296_0148_1001A3373895FE10"/>mend the condition of those who degrade themselves by dirt and sloth.</P>
<P>The common on which Giles's hovel stands is quite a deep marsh in a wet winter, but in summer it looks green and pretty enough. To be sure it would be ra∣ther convenient when one passes that way in a car∣riage, if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would save the post boy from getting off, which is not very safe for the people within the chaise; but instead of any one of these children running out as soon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but set all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked seet and legs, to lie all day upon a sand bank hard by the gate, waiting for the slender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the sound of a carriage, whole coveys of these little scare-serows start up, rush to the gate and all at once thrust out their hats and aprons; and for fear this, together with the noise of their clam∣orous begging, should not sufficiently frighten the horses, they are very apt to let the gate slap ful! against you, be∣fore you are half way through, in their eager scuffle to snatch from each other the half-pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near being killed by these abominable tricks.</P>
<P>Thus five or six little idle creatures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might be useful to the public by working in the field, and who might assist their families by learning to get their bread twenty honest ways, are suffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance half-pence, which after all, they are by no means sure of getting. Indeed, when the neighboring gentlefolks found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they soon left off giving any thing. And I myself, though I used to take out a pen∣ny ready to give, had there been only one to receive it, when I see a whole family established in so beggarly a
<PB N="55" REF="035296_0149_1001C0580EEE4BD0"/>trade, quietly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all.—And so few travellers pass that way, that sometimes, after the whole family have lost a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</P>
<P>As Giles had a far greater taste for living by his wits than his work, he was at one time in hopes that his children might have got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diversion of travellers, and he set about training them in that indecent practice; but unluckily, the Moors being level, the carriages travelled faster than the children tumbled.—He envied those parents who lived on the London road, over the Wiltshire Dowas, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he sometimes extorts from the light and the unthinking, a reward instead of a re∣proof. I begleave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that such tricks are a kind of apprentice∣ship to the trades of begging and thieving.</P>
<P>Giles, to be sure, as his children grew older, began to train them to such other employments as the idle ha∣bits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which some of the poor Cottagers have in that part of the country, and which is doubtless a considerable advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of corrupting his whole family, for his children, as soon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were pro∣moted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three asses, miserable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to escape death by star∣ving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the biggest boys were sent out with these lean and galled animals to carry sand or coals about the neighboring towns. Both sand and coals were often stolen before they got them to sell, or if not, they always took care to cheat in selling them. By long practice in this art, they grew so dextrous, that they could give a pretty
<PB N="56" REF="035296_0150_1001C05C58A9C438"/>good guess how large a coal they could crib out of ev∣ery bag before the buyer would be likely to miss it.</P>
<P>All their odd time was taken up under the pretence of watching these asses on the Moor, or running after five or six half starved geese; but the truth is, these boys were only watching for an opportunity to steal an odd goose of their neighbor's. They used also to pluck the quills or the down from these poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pail. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank, hungry beasts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field, to steal a little good pasture. They contrived to get there just time enough to escape being caught in replacing the stakes they had pulled out for the cattle to get over. For Giles was a prudent, long∣headed fellow, and wherever he stole food for his colts, took care never to steal stakes from the hedges at the same time. He had sense enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a loose faggot, pulled from a neighbor's pile of wood after the family were gone to bed, answered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</P>
<P>Among the many trades which Giles professed, he sometimes practised that of a rat-catcher; but he was addicted to so many tricks that he never followed the same trade long. Whenever he was sent for to a farm∣house, his custom was to kill a few of the old rats, al∣ways taking care to leave a little stock of young ones alive sufficient to keep up the breed; for said he, "If I were to be such a fool as to clear a house or a barn at once, how would my trade be carried on?" And where any barn was overstocked, he used to borrow a few from thence, just to people a neighboring granary which had none; and he might have gone on till now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Parson Wilson's barn door.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="035296_0151_1001C061B9F34038"/>
This worthy Minister, Mr. Wilson, used to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he blamed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick, who was far the best of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loiter∣ing about in a field behind the Parson's garden in search of a hen's nest, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was resolved to have some pan-cakes for supper, though he knew that eggs were a penny a piece. Mr. Wilson had long been desirous of snatching some of this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, as the least hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of shoes, on his promising to go to school next Sunday; but no sooner had Ra∣chel, the boy's mother, got the shoes into her clutches, than she pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Parson's sight, and to be sure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future, at the other end of the parish, and not near the Church-yard. Mr. Wilson, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to despair of any body. Dick was just going to take to his heels, as usual, for fear the old story of the shoes should be brought forward; but find∣ing he could not get off, what does he do but run into a little puddle of muddy water which lay between him and the Parson, that the sight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded subject.—Now it happened that Mr. Wilson was planting a little field of beans, so he thought this a good opportunity to employ Dick; he told him he had got some pretty easy work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with dispatch and regularity, according to the directions given him.</P>
<P>While the boy was busily at work by himself, Giles happened to come by, having been skulking round the back way, to look over the Parson's garden wall, to see if there was any thing worthy climbing over for on
<PB N="58" REF="035296_0152_1001C06372A7C600"/>the ensuing night. He spied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the stingy old Parson, for Giles had a natural antipathy to whatever belonged to the Church. "What has he promised thee a day?" said he, "little enough, I dare say." "He is not to pay me by the day," said Dick, "but says he will give me so much when I have planted this peck, and so much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the case," said Giles. "One may, indeed, get a trifle by this sort of work.— Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when thou art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that case is to dispatch the work as fast as we can, and get rid of the beans with all speed; and as to the seed coming up or not, that is no business of ours; we are paid for planting, not for growing. At the rate thou goest on, thou wouldst not get six-pence to night. Come along, bury away." So saying, he took his hat full of the seed, and where Dick had been ordered to set one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were soon out. But though the peck was emptied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then, Dick," said he, "the snails and the mice may go shares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the blackbirds." So saying, he sent the boy into the Parsonage to receive his pay, taking care to secure about a quarter of the peck of beans for his own colt he put both bag and beans into his own pocket to carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr. Wilson that he had planted his beans and lost the bag.</P>
<P>In the mean time Giles's other boys were busy in emptying the ponds and trout streams in the neighbor∣ing manor. They would steal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eons; by this un∣timely depredation they plundered the owner of his pro∣perty, without enriching themselves. But the pleasure
<PB N="59" REF="035296_0153_1001C065C2D40B78"/>of mischief wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard enough. These, and an hun∣dred other little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>everies, they committed with such dexterity, that old Tom Crib, whose son was transport∣ed last assizes for sheep-stealing, used to be often re∣proaching his boys, that Giles's sons were worth a hun∣dred of such blockheads as he had; for scarce a night past but Giles had some little comfortable thing for sup∣per, which his boys had pilfered in the day, while his undutiful dogs never stole any thing worth having—Giles in the mean time, was busy in his way, but as busy as he was in laying nets, starting coveys, and training dogs, he always took care that his depredati∣ons should not be confined merely to game.</P>
<P>Giles's boys had never seen the inside of a church since they were christened, and the father thought he knew his own interest better than to force them to it; for church time was the season of their harvest. Then the hens' nests were searched, a stray duck was clap∣ped under the smock frock, the tools which might have been left by chance in a farm yard, were picked up, and all the neighboring pigeon-houses were thinned, so that Giles used to boast to his wife, that Sunday was to them the most profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the most laborious day, as she always did her washing and ironing on the Sunday morning, it being, as she said, the only leisure day she had, for on oth∣er days she went about the country, telling fortunes, and selling dream-books, and wicked songs. Neither her husband's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come a∣bout once in every week, it is likely they would never have been washed neither. You might, however, see her as you were going to church, smoothing her own rags on her best red cloak, which she always used for her ironing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when she tra∣velled, and for her blanket at night; such a wretched manager was Rachel! among her other articles of trade
<PB N="60" REF="035296_0154_1001C0690E4EB458"/>one was to make and sell pepper-mint, and other distil∣led waters.—These she had the cheap art of making without trouble, and without expense, for she made them without herbs and without a still. Her way was to fill so many quart bottles with plain water, putting a spoonful of mint water in the mouth of each; these she corked down with rosin, carrying to each customer a phial of real distilled water to taste, by way of sample. This was so good that her bottles were commonly bought up without being opened; but if any suspicion arose, and she was forced to uncork a bottle, by the few drops of distilled water lying on the top, she even then escaped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a second time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the same house.</P>
<P>There is hardly any petty mischief that is not con∣nected with the life of a poacher.—Mr. Wilson was a ware of this; he was not only a pious clergyman, but an upright justice. He used to say that people who were truly conscientious, must be so in small things as well as in great ones, or they would destroy the effect of their own precepts, and their example would not be of general use. For this reason he never would accept of a hare or a partridge from any unqualified person in his parish. He did not content himself with shuffling the thing off by asking no questions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way, that the game was fair∣ly come at; but he used to say that by receiving the booty, he connived at a crime; made himself a sharer in it, and if he gave a present to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to repeat the fault.</P>
<P>One day poor Jack Weston, an honest fellow in the neighborhood, whom Mr. Wilson had kindly visited and relieved in a long sickness, from which he had but just recovered, was brought before him as he was sitting on the justice's bench; Jack was accused of having knocked down a hare, and of all the birds in the air, who
<PB N="61" REF="035296_0155_1001C06D4D6B1EA0"/>should the informer be but Black Giles, the poacher? Mr. Wilson was grieved at the charge, he had a great regard for Jack, but he had a still greater regard for the law. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but said he did not consider it a crime, he did not think game was private property, and he owned he had a strong temptation for doing what he had done which he hoped would plead in his excuse. The jus∣tice desired to know what this temptation was. "Sir," said the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this spring in a bad fever. I had no friend in the world but you, Sir, under God you saved my life by your charita∣ble relief; and I trust also you may have helped to save my soul by your prayers and your good advice. I know I can never make you amends for all your good∣ness, but I thought it would be some comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you some little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wilson, but they were stolen from me, Sir, and I do suspect Black Giles stole them. Yes∣terday morning, Sir, I was crawling out to my work, for I am still but very weak, a fine hare ran across my path. I did not stay to consider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to shew my grati∣tude; so, Sir, without a moment's thought, I did knock down the hare which I was going to carry to your worship, because I knew Madam was fond of hare. I am truly sorry for my fault, and will submit to whatev∣er punishment your worship may please to inflict."</P>
<P>Mr. Wilson was much moved with this honest con∣fession, and touched with the poor fellow's gratitude. What added to the effect of the story, was the weak condition and pale sickly looks of the offender. But this worthy justice never suffered his feelings to bias his integrity▪ he knew that he did not sit on that bench to indulge pity, but to administer justice. And while he was sorry for the offender he would not justify the
<PB N="62" REF="035296_0156_1001C074AF078148"/>offence. "John" said he, "I am surprised that you could for a moment forget that I never accept any gift which causes the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, whose min∣ister I am. At present I fill the chair of the magistrate, to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between those and the others there is more connection than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your affection to me, and I admire your gratitude; but I must not allow ei∣ther affection or gratitude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your business nor mine, John, to settle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we must obey them. Many, I doubt not, break these laws through ignorance, and many I am certain, who would not dare to steal a goose or a tur∣key, make no scruple to knock down a hare or a par∣tridge. You will hereafter think yourself happy that this your first attempt has proved unsuccessful, as I trust you are too honest a fellow ever to intend to turn poach∣er. With poaching much moral evil is connected; a habit of nightly depredation; a custom of prowling in the dark for prey produces, in time, a disrelish for ho∣nest labor. He whose first offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happen to succeed a few times in carrying off his booty undiscov∣ered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no shame attending it, he very soon gets to per∣suade himself that there is also no sin. While some people pretend a scruple about stealing a sheep, they partly live by plundering of warrens. But remember that the warrener pays a high rent, and that therefore his rabbits are as much his property as his sheep. Do not then deceive yourselves with these false distinctions. All property is sacred, and as the laws of the land are intended to fence in that property, he who brings up his children to break down any of these fences, brings them up to certain sin and ruin. He who begins with
<PB N="63" REF="035296_0157_1001A34B6CDF80C8"/>robbing orchards, rabbit warrens, and fish ponds, will probably end with horse-stealing or highway robbery. Poaching is a regular apprenticeship to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy to sit in the stocks fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> killing a patridge, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</P>
<P>"Observe, you who now hear me, the strictness and impartiality of justice. I know Giles to be a worthless fellow, yet it is my duty to take his information; I know Jack Weston to be an honest youth, yet I must be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact; Jack is a worthy lad, but he has committed this fault: I am sorry for you, Jack; but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played worse tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very first offence, for that would be grieving because you are not so great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal; but all this will one day turn out in your favor. Giles is not the more the favorite of heaven because he has hitherto escaped Botany Bay, or the Hulks; nor is it any mark of God's displeasure a∣gainst you, John, that you were found out in your very first attempt."</P>
<P>Here the good justice left off speaking, and no one could contradict the truth of what he had said. Weston humbly submitted to his sentence, but he was very poor, and knew not where to raise the money to pay his sine. His character had always been so fair, that several far∣mers present kindly agreed to advance a trifle each to prevent his being sent to prison, and he thankfully pro∣mised to work out the debt. The justice himself, tho' he could not soften the law, yet showed Weston so much kindness, that he was enabled, before the year was out, to get out of this difficulty. He began to think more seriously than he had ever yet done, and grew to abhor poaching, not merely from fear, but from principle.</P>

We shall soon see whether poaching Giles always got off so successfully. Here we have seen that prosperity is no sure sign of goodness. Next month we may, per∣haps, see that the triumphing of the wicked is short; for I then promise to give the second part of the poacher, together with the entertaining story of the widow Brown's apple-tree.</P>

<HEAD>BLACK GILES, THE POACHER;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With the History of the Widow Brown's Apple Tree.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK my readers got so well acquainted, last month, with Black Giles the Poacher, that they will not expect this month to hear any great good either of Giles himself, his wife Rachel, or any of their family. I am sorry to expose their tricks, but it is their fault, not mine. If I pretend to speak about peo∣ple at all I must tell the truth. I am sure if folks would but turn about and mend, it would be a thousand times pleasanter to me to write their histories; for it is no comfort to tell of any body's faults. If the world would but grow good, I should be glad enough to tell of it; but till it really becomes so, I must go on describing it as it is; otherwise, I should only mislead my readers, instead of instructing them.</P>
<P>As to Giles and his boys, I am sure old Widow Brown has good reason to remember their dexterity.—
<PB N="65" REF="035296_0159_1001C0804E30C448"/>Poor woman! she had a fine little bed of onions in her neat and well-kept garden; she was very fond of her onions, and many a rheumatism has she caught by kneel∣ing down to weed them in a damp day, notwithstand∣ing the little flannel cloak and the bit of an old mat which Madam Wilson gave her, because the old woman would needs weed in wet weather. Her onions she al∣ways carefully treasured up for her winter's store; for an onion makes a little broth very relishing, and is indeed the only savory thing poor people are used to get. She also had a small orchard, containing about a dozen ap∣ple trees, with which, in a good year, she has been known to make a couple of barrels of cider, which she sold to her landlord towards paying her rent, besides, having a little keg which she was able to keep back for her own drinking. Well! would you believe it, Giles and his boys marked both onions and apples for their own; in∣deed, a man who stole so many rabbits from the warren was likely enough to steal onions for sauce. One day, when the widow was abroad on a little business, Giles and his boys made a clear riddance of the onion bed; and when they had pulled up every single onion, they then turned a couple of pigs into the garden, who allu∣red by the smell, tore up the bed in such a manner, that the widow, when she came home, had not the least doubt but the pigs had been the thieves. To confirm this opinion, they took care to leave the little hatch half open at one end of the garden, and to break down a bit of a fence at the other end.</P>
<P>I wonder how any body can find in his heart not to pity and respect poor old widows. There is something so forlorn and helpless in their condition, that me thinks it is a call on every body, men, women and children, to do them all the kind services that fall in their way.—Surely their having no one to take their part, is an addi∣tional reason for kind hearted people not to hurt and oppress them. But it was this very reason which led Giles to do this woman an hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="035296_0160_1001C084A5EE6360"/>
It happened unluckily for this poor widow that her cottage stood quite alone. On several mornings toge∣ther (for roguery gets up much earlier than industry,) Giles and his boys stole regularly into her orchard, fol∣lowed by their Jack Asses. She was so deaf that she could not hear the asses if they had brayed ever so loud, and to this Giles trusted; for he was very cautious in his rogueries; since he could not otherwise have con∣trived to keep out of prison; for though he was almost always suspected, he had seldom been taken up, and ne∣ver convicted. The boys used to fill their bags, load their asses, and then march off; and if in their way to the town where the apples were to be sold, they chan∣ced to pass by one of their neighbors who might be likely to suspect them, they then all at once began to scream out, "buy my coal!—buy my sand!"</P>
<P>Besides the trees in her orchard, poor Widow Brown had in her small garden one apple-tree particularly sine; it was a Redstreak, so tempting and so lovely, that Giles's family had watched it with longing eyes, till at last they resolved on a plan for carrying off all this sine fruit in their bags. But it was a nice point to manage. The tree stood directly under her chamber-window, so that there was some danger that she might spie them at the work. They therefore determined to wait till the next Sunday morning, when they knew she would not fail to be at church. Sunday came, and during service Giles attended. It was a lone house, as I said before, and the rest of the parish were safe at church. In a trice the tree was cleared, the bags were filled, the asses were whipt, the thieves were off, the coast was clear, and all was safe and quiet by the time the sermon was over.</P>
<P>Unluckily, however, it happened that this tree was so beautiful and the fruit so sine, that the people as they used to pass to and from church, were very apt to stop and admire Widow Brown's Redstreaks; and some of the farmers rather envied her, that, in that scarce season,
<PB N="67" REF="035296_0161_1001C08BDE2FF760"/>when they hardly expected to make a pye out of a large orchard, she was likely to make cider from a single tree. I am afraid, indeed, if I must speak out, she herself rather set her heart too much upon this tree, and had felt as much pride as gratitude to a good providence for it; but this failing of her's was no excuse for Gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. The covetousness of this thief had for once got the bet∣ter of his caution; the tree was too completely stripped though the youngest boy Dick did beg hard that his fa∣ther would leave the poor old woman enough for a few dumplings, and when Giles ordered Dick in his turn to shake the tree, the boy did it so gently that hardly any apples fell, for which he got a good shake of the stick with which the old man was beating down the apples.</P>
<P>The neighbors, on their return from church, stopped as usual, but it was not, alas! to admire the apples, for apples there were none left; but to lament the robbery and console the widow: meantime the Red streaks were safely lodged in Giles's hovel, under a few bun∣dles of hay which he had contrived to pull from the farmers mow the night before, for the use of his jack∣asses. Such a stir, however, began to be made about the widow's apple-tree, that Giles, who knew how much his character laid him open to suspicion, as soon as he saw the people safe in church again in the afternoon, ordered his boys to carry each a hatful of the apples, and thrust them in at a little casement window which happened to be open in the house of Samuel Price, a very honest carpenter in that parish, who was at church with his whole family. Giles's plan, by this contri∣vance, was to lay the theft on Price's sons, in case the thing should come to be further enquired into. Here Dick put in a word, and begged and prayed his father not to force them to carry the apples to Price's. But all that he got by his begging, was such a knock as had nearly laid him on the earth.—"What, you cowardly rascal," said Giles, "you will go and peach I suppose,
<PB N="68" REF="035296_0162_1001C08EEEC530B8"/>and get your father sent to gaol." Poor Widow Brown, though her trouble had made her still weaker than she was, went to church again in the afternoon; indeed she rightly thought that trouble was a new rea∣son why she ought to go. During this service she tried with all her might not to think of her Redstreaks, and whenever they would come into her head she took up her prayer book directly, and so she forgot them a little, and indeed she found herself much easier when she came out of the church than when she went in. Now it happened oddly enough, that on that Sunday, of all the Sundays in the year, she should call in to rest a lit∣tle at Samuel Price's, to tell over again the lamentable story of the apples, and to consult with him how the thief might be brought to justice. But, O reader! guess if you can, for I am sure I cannot tell you, what was her surprise, when on going into Samuel Price's kitch∣en she saw her own Redstreaks lying in the window! The apples were of a sort too remarkable for color, shape, and size to be mistaken. There was not such another tree in the parish. Widow Brown immediate∣ly screamed out, "lass-a-day! as sure as can be here are my Redstreaks; I could swear to them in any court." Samuel Price who believed his sons to be as honest as himself, was shocked and troubled at the sight. He knew he had no Redstreaks of his own; he knew there were no apples in the window when he went to church. He did verily believe them to be the widow's. But how they came there he could not possibly guess. He called for Tom, the only one of his sons who now liv∣ed at home. Tom was at the Sunday school, which he had never once missed since Mr. Wilson the minister had set up one in the parish. Was such a boy likely to do such a deed?</P>
<P>A croud was by this time got about Price's door, a∣mong which was Giles and his boys, who had already taken care to spread the news that Tom Price was the
<PB N="69" REF="035296_0163_1001A34D5F0596E0"/>thief. Most people were unwilling to believe it. His character was very good, but appearances were strong∣ly against him. Mr. Wilson, who had staid to christen a child, now came in. He was much concerned that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Price, the best boy in his school, should stand ac∣cused of such a crime. He sent for the boy, examined and cross examined him. No marks of guilt appeared. But still though he pleaded <HI>not guilty,</HI> there lay the Redstreaks in his father's window. All the idle fellows in the place, who were likely to have committed such a theft themselves, fell with great vengeance on poor Tom. The wicked seldom give any quarter. "This is one of your sanctified ones!" cried they. "This was all the good that Sunday schools did! For their parts they never saw any good come by religion. Sunday was the only day for a little pastime, and if poor boys must be shut up with their godly books when they ought to be out taking a little pleasure, it was no wonder they made themselves amends by such tricks." Another said, he should like to see Parson Wilson's righteous one well whipped. A third hoped he would be clapped in the stocks for a young hypocrite as he was, while old Giles, who thought to avoid suspicion by being more violent than the rest, declared, that "he hoped the young dog would be transported for life."</P>
<P>Mr. Wilson was too wise and too just to proceed a∣gainst Tom without full proof. He declared the crime was a very heavy one, and he feared that heavy must be the punishment. Tom, who knew his own inno∣cence, earnestly prayed to God that it might be made to appear as clear as the noon-day, and very fervent were his secret devotions on that night.</P>
<P>Black Giles passed his night in a very different man∣ner. He set off as soon as it was dark with his sons and their jack-asses laden with their stolen goods. As such a cry was raised about the apples, he did not think it safe to keep them longer at home, but resolved to go
<PB N="70" REF="035296_0164_1001C09125B0C9D8"/>and sell them at the next town; borrowing without leave, a lame colt out of the moor to assist in carrying off his booty.</P>
<P>Giles and his eldest sons had rare sport all the way in thinking, that while they were enjoying the profit of their plunder, Tom Price would be whipped round the market place at least, if not sent beyond sea. But the younger boy, Dick, who had naturally a tender heart, though hardened by his long familiarity with sin, could not help crying when he thought that Tom Price might perhaps be transported for a crime which he him∣self had helped to commit. He had no compunction a∣bout the robbery, for he had not been instructed in the great principles of truth and justice. Nor would he, therefore, perhaps, have had much remorse about accu∣sing an innocent boy. But tho' utterly devoid of prin∣ciple, he had some remains of natural feeling and of gratitude. Tom Price had often given him a bit of his own bread and cheese; and once, when Dick was like to be drowned, Tom had jumped into the pond with his clothes on, and saved his life when he was just sink∣ing: the remembrance of all this made his heart heavy. He said nothing: as he trotted barefoot after the asses, he heard his father and brothers laugh at having out∣witted the godly ones; and he grieved to think how poor Tom would suffer for his wickedness, yet fear kept him silent; they called him sulky dog, and lashed the asses till, they bled.</P>
<P>In the mean time Tom Price kept up his spirits as well as he could. He worked hard all day, and prayed heartily night and morning. "It is true," said he to himself, "I am not guilty of this sin; but let this ac∣cusation set me on examining myself, and truly repent∣ing of all my other sins, for I found enough to repent of, though I thank God I did not steal those apples."</P>
<P>At length Sunday came. Tom went to school as u∣sual. As soon as he walked in there was a deal of
<PB N="71" REF="035296_0165_1001C09700099CF0"/>whispering and laughing among the worst of the boys; and he overheard them say, "who would have thought it? This is master's favorite! This is Parson Wilson's sober Tommy! We shan't have Tommy thrown in our teeth again if we go to get a bird's nest, or gather a few nuts of a Sunday." "Your demure ones are always hypocrites," says another. "The still sow sucks all the milk," says a third.</P>
<P>Giles's family had always kept clear of the school.—Dick, indeed, had sometimes wished to go, not that he had much sense of sin, or desire after goodness, but he thought if he could once read, he might rise in the world, and not be forced to drive asses all his life.—Through this whole Saturday night he could not sleep. He longed to know what would be done to Tom. He began to wish to go to school, but he had not courage; sin is very cowardly; so on the Sunday morning he went and sat himself down under the church wall. Mr. Wilson passed by. It was not his way to reject the most wicked, till he had tried every means to bring them e∣ver, and even then he pitied and prayed for them. He had indeed long left off talking to Giles's sons; but see∣ing Dick sitting by himself, he once more spoke to him, desired him to leave off his vagabond life, and go with him into the school. The boy hung down his head, but made no answer. He did not, however, either rise up and run away, or look sulky, as he used to do. The Minister desired him once more. "Sir," said the boy, "I can't go; I am so big I am ashamed." "The big∣ger you are the less time you have to loose." "But, Sir, I can't read." "Then it is high time you should learn." "I should be ashamed to begin to learn my letters."—"The shame is not in beginning to learn them, but in being contented never to know them." "But, Sir, I am so raggod!" "God looks at the heart, and not at the coat." "But, Sir, I have no shoes and stockings." "So much the worse. I remember who gave you
<PB N="72" REF="035296_0166_1001C098A529A048"/>both," (here Dick coloured.) "It is bad to want shoes and stockings; but still if you can drive your asses a do∣zen miles without them, you may certainly walk to school without them." "But, Sir, the good boys will hate me, and won't speak to me." "Good boys hate nobody, and as to not speaking to you, to be sure they will not keep you company while you go on in your present evil courses; but as soon as they see you wish to re∣form, they will help you, and pity you, and teach you, and so come along." Here Mr. Wilson took this dirty boy by the hand, and gently pulled him forward, kindly talking to him all the way.</P>
<P>How the whole school stared to see Dick Giles come in! No one, however, dared to say what he thought. The business went on, and Dick slunk into a corner, partly to hide his rags, and partly to hide his sin, for last Sundays transaction sat heavy at his heart, not be∣cause he had stolen the apples, but because Tom Price had been accused. This, I say, made him slink behind. Poor boy! he little thought there was One saw him who sees all things, aad from whose eye no hole nor corner can hide the sinner.</P>
<P>It was the custom in that school for the master, who was a good and wise man, to mark down in his pocket book all the events of the week, that he might turn them to some account in his Sunday evening instruc∣tions, such as any useful story in the newspaper, any account of boys being drowned as they were out in a pleasure boat on Sundays; any sudden death in the pa∣rish, or any other remarkable visitation of Providence, insomuch, that many young people of the place, who did not belong to the school, and many parents also, used to drop in for an hour on a Sunday evening, when they were sure to hear something profitable. The Mi∣nister greatly approved this practice, and often called in
<PB N="73" REF="035296_0167_1001C09B52D22168"/>himself, which was a great support to the master, and encouragement to the people.</P>
<P>The master had taken a deep concern in the story of widow Brown's apple-tree. He could not believe Tom Price was guilty, nor dared he pronounce him innocent; but he resolved to turn the instructions of the present evening to this subject. He began thus; "My Dear boys, however light some of you may make of robbing an orchard, yet I have often told you there is no such thing as a little sin, if it be wilful or habitu∣al. I wish now to explain to you also, that there is hardly such a thing as a single, solitary sin. You know I teach you not merely to repeat the commandments as an exercise for your memory, but as a rule for your conduct. If you were to come here only to learn to read and spell on a Sunday, I should think that was not employing God's day for God's work; but I teach you to read that you may by this means come so to un∣derstand the Bible and the Catechism, as to make every text in the one, and every question and answer in the other, to be so fixed in your hearts, that they may bring forth the fruits of good living.</P>

<P>I will put the case. Some wicked boy has robbed widow Brown's orchard. (Here the eyes of every one were turned on poor Tom Price, except those of Dick Ciles, who fixed his on the ground.) I accuse no one, continued the master, Tom Price is a good boy, and was not missing at the time of the robbe∣ry; these are two reasons why I presume he is inno∣cent; but whoever it was, you allow that by stealing these apples he broke the eighth commandment.</P>

<P>This was the only part of the case in which poor Dick Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es's heart did not smite him; for he knew that he had disobeyed no father; for his father, alas! was still w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eder than himself, and had brought him to commit the sin.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid not, master.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here Dick Giles was not so hardened but that he re∣membered how many curses had passed between him and his father while they were filling the bags, and he was afraid to look up. The master went on.</P>
<P>"I will now go one step further. If the thief, to all his other sins, has added that of accusing the innocent to save himself, if he should break the ninth command∣ment, by <HI>bearing false witness against a harmless neighbor,</HI> SIX COMMANDMENTS ARE BROKEN FOR AN APPLE! But if it be otherwise, if Tom Price should be found guilty, 'tis not his good character shall save him. I shall shed tears over him, but punish him I must."—"No, that you shan't, roared out Dick Giles, who sprung from his hiding place, fell on his knees, and burst out a crying, "Tom Price is as good a boy as ever lived; it was father and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the apples!"</P>
<P>It would have done your heart good to have seen the joy of the master, the modest blushes of Tom Price, and the satisfaction of every honest boy in the school.—All shook hands with Tom, and even Dick got some portion of pity. I wish I had room to give my readers the moving exhortation which the master gave. But while Mr. Wilson left the guilty boy to the manage∣ment of the master, he thought it became him, as a Mi∣nister and a Magistrate, to go to the extent of the law in punishing the father. Early on the Monday morn∣ing he sent to apprehend Giles; in the mean time, Mr. Wilson was sent for to a gardener's house, two miles distant, to attend a man who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s dying. This was a duty to which all others gave way in his mind. He set out directly, but what was his surprise on his arrival to see, on a little bed, on the floor, poaching Giles lying in all the agonies of death! Jack Weston, the same poor
<PB N="76" REF="035296_0170_1001C0A5DAE3F110"/>young man against whom Giles had informed for kill∣ing a hare, was kneeling by him, offering him some broth, and talking to him in the kindest manner. Mr. Wilson begged to know the meaning of all this, and Jack Weston spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"At four this morning, as I was going out to mow, passing under the high wall of this garden, I heard a most dismal moaning. The nearer I came, the more dismal it grew. At last, who should I see but poor Giles groaning and struggling under a quantity of bricks and stones, but not able to stir. The day before he had marked a fine large not on this old wall, and resolved to steal it, for he thought it might do as well to ketch par∣tridges as to preserve cherries; so, Sir, standing on the very top of this wall, and tugging with all his might to loosen the net from the hooks which fastened it, down came Giles, net, wall and all, for the wall was gone to decay. It was very high indeed, and poor Giles not only broke his thigh, but has got a terrible blow on his brain, and is bruised all over like a mummy. On see∣ing me, Sir, poor Giles cried out, 'O Jack! I did try to ruin thee by lodging that information, and now thou wilt be revenged by letting me lie here and perish.'—God forbid, Giles, cried I: thou shalt see what sort of revenge a Christian takes. So, Sir, I sent off the gar∣dener's boy to fetch a surgeon, while I scampered home and brought on my back this bit of a hammock, which is indeed my own bed, and put Giles upon it, we then lifted him up bed and all, as tenderly as if he had been a gentleman, and brought him in here. My wife has just brought him a drop of nice broth, and now, Sir, as I have done what I could for his poor perishing body, it was I who took the liberty to send to you to come to try to help his poor soul, for the Doctor says he can't live."</P>
<P>Mr. Wilson could not help saying to himself, "Such an action as this is worth a whole volume of comments
<PB N="77" REF="035296_0171_1001C0AB741B2838"/>on that precept of our blessed Master, 'Do good to them that hate you." Giles's dying groans confirmed the sad account Weston had just given. The poor wretch could neither pray himself nor attend to the Minister. He could only cry out, "Oh Sir, what will become of me? I don't know how to repent. Oh my poor wicked children! Sir, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed them all up in sin and ignorance. Have mercy on them, Sir; let me not meet them in the place of torment to which I am going."—He languished a few days and died in the greatest misery.</P>
<P>Except the—Minister and Jack Weston, no one came to see poor Giles, besides Tom Price, who had been so sadly wronged by him. Tom often brought him his own rice milk or apple dumpling, and Giles, ignorant and depraved as he was, often cried out, that he thought now there must be some truth in religion, since it taught even a boy to <HI>deny himself</HI> and to <HI>forgive an injury.</HI>—Mr. Wilson the next Sunday made a moving discourse on the danger of what are called "petty offences."—This, together with the awful death of Giles, produ∣ced such an effect, that no Poacher has been able to shew his head in that parish ever since.</P>

<HEAD>SOME NEW THOUGHTS FOR THE NEW-YEAR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Showing how Mr Thrifty the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Mercer, succeeded in his Trade by always examining his Books soon after Christmas, and how Mr. Care∣less, by negrecting this rule, let all his assai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s run to ruin before he was aware of it. After which some Christian help is offered to all those persons, high-or low, who have a mind to examine into the account of their own lives during the last year.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Thrifty (who keeps that great Mer∣cer's shop in London, which has been getting
<PB N="78" REF="035296_0172_1001C0B4A42A6858"/>on so famously of late) was once asked to dine two days after Christmas by his neighbor Careless (who I have heard by-the-by has been since made bankrupt.) Thrif∣ty answered, that it was quite impossible to dine out then, for that he was settling his Christmas accounts, "which," added he, "must not be neglected for the world, for I should never know where I was; I should not understand whether I was going forward or back∣ward, getting rich or growing ever so poor, if I was to neglect casting up and balancing and examining into every thing at Christmas."—"Why to be sure," answered Careless, "you have a large business Mr. Thrifty, and a large business must be looked after."—"'Tis by my looking after it that it has become so large," returned Thrifty, with a look of great shrewd∣ness, "and if I were not to look after it still, it would soon grow little again I warrant you."</P>
<P>I am persuaded that my readers and I shall one and all of us allow, that this was a very right observation of Mr. Thrifty's, and yet I doubt whether we shall e∣qually agree in the following remark, though it has near∣ly the same foundation; namely, that if we hope to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved from ruin in the next world, and to sucee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in our everlasting interests, it is necessary that we should use the very same kind of diligence in examining the state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> souls, which Mr. Thrifty used in examining the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate of his worldly business.</P>
<P>There is also a manner of deceiving ourselves in our religious concerns, which is very like that in which they who fail in business are apt to be deceived. No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n mean's entirely and at all times to neglect his soul; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he merely puts off his self-examination, or he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and slovenly about it. Mr. Careless used always to be of opinion, that a regular yearly balancing of his books was not necessary. He thought that he could form a pretty fair general guess at the state of his af∣fairs, without taking all the trouble that Mr. Thrifty
<PB N="79" REF="035296_0173_1001A361ACD4BEE0"/>took in going particularly into them. It proved, how∣ever, when Mr. Careless broke, that the few goods he had to shew had been most strangely over-valued, and on the other hand, that the debts he owed amounted to about five times the sum he expected. Now I am per∣suaded, that those of my readers who never examine their hearts, will, on the day of judgment, find themselves as much mistaken, in respect to the worth of their sup∣posed virtues as well as the number of their sins (which are like so many debts due to God) as ever Mr. Care∣less was, and the only way of recovering from their danger, will be to do immediately what the friends of Mr. Careless advised him to do the Christmas before he broke—I mean to look their affairs fully in the face, to take instant measures for getting at a true and just esti∣mate of them, and then to adopt some wise and pru∣dent plan for their effectual relief.</P>
<P>I will add one other observation. This Mr. Care∣less, as I have heard, did not break through any violent misconduct: he never was guilty of any scandalous and immediately ruinous transactions like some others, but then he was inattentive to his business, and by this mere inattention he was year after year dropping down, with∣out being aware of it, into sure and certain ruin: he never could be persuaded to look carefully into his af∣fairs, which was owing at first to idleness, and latterly to this additional cause, that a certain kind of fearful∣ness and false shame had got about him, insomuch, that when some friends of his, who perceived his ignorance of book-keeping, offered, on the Christmas before he broke, to lend him some assistance, he absolutely decli∣ned it, which was considered always as one of the most unpardonable parts of his whole conduct.</P>
<P>I propose now, after the example of these friends of Mr. Careless, to hold out to my readers some assistance in entering into that self-examination which I am here pressing upon them, and if they think proper to neglect
<PB N="80" REF="035296_0174_1001C0C2DDC54EB0"/>the help that is offered them, I can only say, that I think they really so much resemble Mr. Careless, that they ought to come forward and take his part, and to defend his character from those severe censures which I am told that his neglect of a like offer has every where brought upon him.</P>
<P>But let me first add a sew more words to prove that the kind of comperison which I have spoken of, is real∣ly a just one; for many people seem by no means to be convinced, that a man may be ruined in his soul by mere neglect, in the same manner as he may in his trading business.—I will venture to observe on this head, that neglect is apt to bring on ruin not in a mer∣cer's shop only, but even in every thing. Name me now, if you can, any trade or profession in life which can thrive without diligence. Has not God so made the world, as to shew that man must be diligent, and that it is at his peril to be neglectful? There is no bu∣siness that will do itself; moreover, if a man be ever so diligent in one thing, but quite neglectful of another, he is sure to feel the consequence even of this partial carelessness. If a farmer was to look well to his labor∣ers in the field, but not to mind his marketing; or if trader Thrifty was to be always bringing up his books in the counting-house, but was never to go forward in∣to the shop and wait upon his customers, do you think he would not suffer by it?—So if a man minds this world only, and never thinks of the next, the business of the next world will certainly not be done, as he will find hereafter to his cost. Some men, if any one should enquire into the state of their souls, and should ask <HI>for a reason of the hope that is in them,</HI> would merely an∣swer in general, that God is merciful, and that Christ died for them, and add the like general reasons, which any man in Christendom may give as well as they; and if you were to press them further, they could only say, "I know not much about the matter, I hope well, I trust
<PB N="81" REF="035296_0175_1001A367F5FFDA40"/>God with my soul: I shall fare as well as other men do: I thank God I never made any doubt of my Salvation." Now what do all such kind of sayings discover, but a wilful neglect of their Salvation? It is as if a ship∣master should let his vessel alone and say, "I will ven∣ture it among the rocks, and waves, and winds: I will trust God with it: it will fare as well as other vessels." I say, what horrible abuse of God's mercy is this! He commands us to give diligence to make our calling and election sure, and in this way of diligence trust him.</P>
<P>It may further be added, that in general we find in all our affairs in this life, that whatever is most import∣ant, requires the highest degree of care and diligence: ought we not, therefore, to fear least negligence should prove the most fatal of all in the concerns of the immort∣al soul, which are certainly the greatest of our concerns? What care is necessary to keep alive our body: it must be daily fed, and clothed, and cherished, and provided for in a vast variety of ways; and it is not necessary to lay violent hands upon it in order to destroy it. If due care be not taken of it, it perishes of course. So it is with a man's soul; it is certainly perishing if its inter∣ests are neglected and forgotten by him, and it may be as effectually destroyed without any great sin, as the body may without any great blow.</P>
<P>Once more I beg leave to add, that it is no proof our souls are safe, that we feel at present no harm or in∣convenience from our neglect of them. Mr. Careless felt no inconvenience from <HI>his</HI> neglect at the time when he asked Thrifty to dinner. His bankruptcy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame up∣on him quite like a thunder-clap: his things, indeed, were in confusion before, but the same idleness which kept him from examining them, kept him from know∣ing beforehand the misery that awaited him. I appre∣hend, therefore, that the cheerfulness of which some thoughtless and irreligious people make their boast, is no proof of their safety, but is merely like the gaiety of

<P>But I must observe further, that there is one great error which a vast number of people fall into, and by which they are apt to be made very easy under the most complete neglect of their souls. The mistake I mean is the following one—they are diligent, as they call it, at their duty: thus, for instance, they dig hard, if digging is their business; they write and cast accounts, and keep shop diligently, if they are clerks or shop∣keepers; or they do their exercise briskly, and follow orders readily, if they are soldiers or sailors, and having done this their daily work, they think they have done all that can be required of them. Religion they possi∣bly allow to be a good thing, but this they say is re∣ligion: nay, to do their work well, is the best sort of religion, and they desire to know no other. Let us now combat this error, which has a very fair appearance, and which has also some mixture of truth with it.</P>
<P>Presuming my readers to believe the Bible, I will here, in the first place, quote Scripture on the subject. If to labor merely in our calling, is one and the same thing as to labor for our souls, how comes our Saviour to have used for instance such expressions as the following? <HI>Labor not for the meat that perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to everlasting life.</HI> I grant our Saviour does not hereby mean, that we ought not in any sense to labor for the <HI>meat that perisheth,</HI> but he certainly must mean that we ought not to labor for this only, nor even for this chiefly; he must also mean, that there is a duty called by him "laboring for everlasting life," which is a distinct thing from laboring to support our bodies; for if these things were not distinct, he would not have mentioned them so distinctly. Again our Saviour speaks of a man who had been <HI>filling his garners and laying up goods for many years,</HI> who evidently, therefore, was
<PB N="83" REF="035296_0177_1001C0D6259C4BC0"/>a very diligent man in his business, and yet this is the very man who is pointed out as one whose soul had been neglected: for it is said, <HI>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee.</HI> I will add another remarkable saying of our Saviour on the same subject. He describes the general invitation to attend to the Gospel by comparing it to "a Marriage Supper," to which, said he, when men were asked to come, <HI>they all with one consent be∣gan to make excuse, for one went to his farm, another to his merchandize. One said, I have bought a yoke of oxen, and I must needs go and prove them, and another said, I have married a wife, and therefere I cannot come.</HI> Nothing can prove more plainly than this par∣able the point we are now urging; for it shews, that attention to our worldly business, so far from being the same thing as attention to religion, is often the main hindrance to it. I am going to my farm, said the men in Christ's time, and therefore I cannot attend to the Gospel. I am going to my farm, say these men now; but they have the face even to pretend that this is the same thing as attending to the Gospel, than which, no∣thing can be more contrary to our Saviour's declaration. Our Saviour ends his parable by assuring all the people who put him off by any such excuses, that <HI>none of those men that were bidden shall taste of his Supper;</HI> which is as if he had said, "You who give no attention to the Gospel, shall have no share in the benefits of it. You have been invited indeed, but since you do not come, you shall never taste of its salvation."</P>
<P>And indeed it seems quite agreeable to reason to sup∣pose, that God, who has made man to consist both of body and mind, is not likely to be satisfied with his mere bodily labor, but that he must require the affections of the mind to be given to Him also. If mere diligence in our calling is all in all, I see not why a man may not be allowed even to deny the being of God: for an Atheist may very possibly be led to mind his business
<PB N="84" REF="035296_0178_1001C0DA77BFAAE0"/>tolerably well from mere worldly motives, and just in like manner some persons who call themselves Chris∣tians, may be induced to go on regularly with their work, all the while forgetting God as much as if they were down-right Atheists.</P>
<P>Having thus proved, as I trust, the necessity of attend∣ing to the interests of the soul, and having also shewn that it is not sufficient to carry on our worldly business merely on worldly principles, I shall proceed to the main point which is before us, namely, to offer the reader some help towards a serious examination of his conduct during the last year; and I trust that what will be fur∣ther said, will throw much additional light on the ge∣neral sebject.</P>
<P>First, then, I desire the reader seriously to ask himself, <HI>What has been the ordinary ground and motive of his actions during the last year?</HI> You prosess, I doubt not, to believe in God, and you expect hereafter to be judg∣ed by Him; but have you in the last year made it the leading motive of all your actions, to endeavor to please Him? It is in vain to think that you have pleased Him, if you have not intended to please Him. How is it that we judge in cases that arise between a man and his fel∣low creatures? I believe a wise, for instance, would not much thank her husband for doing her a kindness, if she thought he never intended her a kindness, and had her not at all in his thoughts when he did it. Her husband's affection is the thing she chiefly wants, and the kind action is only so far pleasing to her, as it is a symptom of this affection in the mind. Now all this is extremely reasonable; there is some nicety, I grant, in the distinction, but it is a nicety we all very well under∣stand in our own case, and we have no right, therefore, to say that we cannot understand it when God is con∣cerned. <HI>My son</HI> (saith God to us in the Scripture) <HI>give me thine heart.</HI> And again, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and
<PB N="85" REF="035296_0179_1001C0E49700CF28"/>all thy strength;</HI> this is the first and great command∣ment. Disregarding this claim, we toil, we dig, we labor for our daily bread, without almost thinking of God in it, and at the year's end we expect him to ac∣cept this bodily service (though performed with a mere view to our own worldly benefit) instead of the affec∣tions he has required of us.</P>
<P>Now as this is a very great and awful subject, and as it is one on which every thing else that we shall add will be made to rest, let us endeavor to lead the reader to dwell very seriously upon it. God is that being in whose character is to be found every possible perfection: He is most great and glorious, and holy, and excellent, and bountiful, and benevolent; and he is also full of compassion and tender mercy. Has any fellow-creature a claim to our regard? God has a still clearer and more undoubted claim; and if we refuse to pay regard to God, we may on much the same ground refuse to honor our father, to love our nearest relations, and to render thanks to all our earthly benefactors. They that never think of God, may, on a like principle, excuse themselves from ever thinking of them also: for is He not our Benefac∣tor? Is He not our Father? Is it not He that sends us those very friends who are such comforts to us, and who bestows upon us all our blessings? Endeavor now to count all His mercies to you during the past year. Number first all the blessings that have come to you by the means of friends, and all your various family com∣forts; these all have proceeded originally from God: Think next of the success which you may have had in your calling. It is not your own hand that has gotten you the guineas which perhaps you have been lately numbering—It is the Lord. Think next of the health you have had, and the degree of freedom from bodily pain. It is God also that defends us <HI>from the noisome pestilence, from the arrow that flieth by night, and from the pestilence that walketh at noon-day.</HI> Again, think
<PB N="86" REF="035296_0180_1001C0E6872FEF70"/>of the dangers of other kinds which you may in the last year have escaped, whether from secret enemies or open violence: the dangers to your person, to your proper∣ty, and to your reputation. Why is it that you are alive and well, and in so much security, at the year's end? It is because the Lord hath been with you by night and by day, to watch over you, and guard and protect you, and keep you from evil. To these mer∣cies, if you add your own particular and special mer∣cies, and if you add, moreover, all the infinite blessings of the gospel, such as the promise of the forgiveness of sins, through Jesus Christ, and the hope of everlast∣ing life, surely you must own that the Lord's goodness is vast and unspeakable, and that his mercies are over all his works, and that they are more in number than the hairs of your head, and as the sands on the sea∣shore, innumerable. Do you not now, therefore, be∣gin to see the nature of your obligation to him, and the reasonableness of endeavoring to please a Being who is thus great and good also? What becomes, then, of that observation, so plausible to an irreligious mind, namely, that if we have but done our work regularly, we have fulfilled our duty, even though God has not been thought of in it? Surely it is an observation full of baseness and ingratitude. I believe no man, who loves his family and friends, forbears to think of them now and then, while his hand is at its labor; and why are not our thoughts to ascend in like manner to God, as the great father of mercies, while the day's business is going forward; and why may not the desire to please Him well in all things, form the very motive and spur to all our industry? Has this, then, been the ground and motive of your diligence during the last year? This is the first question that is proposed to you.</P>
<P>When this duty of regarding God in all things is well settled and understood (a duty which, by-the-by, is of all duties the strongest and clearest) then it be∣comes
<PB N="87" REF="035296_0181_1001C0EC7A2A84A8"/>easy to prove a number of further points, which are apt otherwise to be neglected; as for instance, <HI>the obliga∣tion to worship God in public and in secret.</HI> If we seel that regard to God which has been spoken of, we shall be naturally, as it were, disposed to pray to him. If we feel the obligations that have been mentioned, we shall be ready to kneel down and thank him; and if we are sensible that it is He who not only supplies our wants, but also forgives us our sins, and likewise that it is by Him alone, as the Scripture tells us, that we are enabled to think a good thought, and to fulfil any one duty aright, it follows that we shall be con∣tinually enlarging our petitions to Him, and that we shall call upon Him daily for all these important and indisp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsible blessings. Have you then been thus lead∣ing a life of dependance on God, and truly devout pray∣er to Him, both in the public congregation, in your fa∣mily, and in secret, during the last year?</P>
<P>When this duty to God is well understood, then the sin of <HI>neglecting the Sabbath</HI> begins to seem very plain also. This is that day which has been mercifully set apart for religious uses, it therefore is the day for more particular and earnest prayer in private and in public, and also for more regular self-examination than can always take place on other days; and it may be re∣marked, that as on every Sunday we ought to call our∣selves to account for our behaviour during the week, so at the year's end it may be proper to take ourselves to task for all our conduct on the Sabbaths; for if they have been neglected, it is more than probable that our whole duty has been neglected by us.</P>
<P>We will next speak of <HI>reading the Scriptures.</HI> The difuse of this practice arises from the same cause which we have before referred to, namely the want of a due regard to God. Many of those who are most negli∣gent in this point, nevertheless acknowledge the Bible to be the word of God. It is plain therefore that the
<PB N="88" REF="035296_0182_1001C0F602801748"/>negligence of these persons must arise from their feeling no desire to know what is the will of their Heavenly Father; for if they felt a desire to know his will, they certainly would take all means of knowing it. If a ser∣vant had got a letter directed to him which he believ∣ed to be from his master, and was zealous to do his mas∣ter's will, do you think he would not be eager to open and read the letter? And if we are earnest in like man∣ner to know and do the will of God, shall we not be eager to open and read the scriptures? I believe it is the excuse of some that the scriptures are difficult to be understood, and that their meaning in many places is doubtful; to which I answer, that so is the meaning of all books more or less to some kind of persons. The ob∣jection proves only at the most, that you should read for the present those parts of them which are more easy, and which have the most manifest tendency to do you good. In fact, however, it is the want of a deep con∣cern about the salvation of our souls, (which is the chief subject the bible treats of) that causes it to appear so difficult, as well as insipid and unimproving as it does to some people.</P>
<P>We have spoken hitherto only of religious duties.—We will now say something of the ordinary duties of life, and if we describe them truly, it will immediately appear that even these are not likely to have been ful∣filled in any respect as they ought, unless there has been a religious principle for the foundation.</P>
<P>First, how have you performed the duties of your own calling in the last year? Here it may perhaps be answered by some people, "We have no calling, for we are able through the money which we have saved, or which our fathers have saved for us, to live without work. We have therefore had nothing to do; we are independent persons." What, then, are you independ∣ent of God? It is the business of religion to put an end to this fancied right to independence, and to subject e∣every thought, word, and action, to the will of a superior,
<PB N="89" REF="035296_0183_1001C0FCF6586638"/>to the will I mean of a strict and holy God. What a blessing to society is religion when considered in this view! It turns all those persons who are otherwise the drones of the community, into some of the most for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> able people in it. O, how many troubles and miseries are there in this land, which, if a few more of our inde∣pendent ladies and gentlemen would be so good as to turn Christians, (I mean zealous Christians!) would presently be relieved. What a great number of poor cottagers are there who drag on life both in wickedness and misery, for the want of being overlooked, and in∣structed, and advised, and now and then assisted by their superiors who dwell near them? Here perhaps a whole parish is neglected through want of a Christian paris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> officer; there the accounts of an hospital need examin∣ing, or a work house is given up to vice and ruin; here a useful club wants a treasurer or patron, or a declining charity school is without an inspector, or a new school ought to be set up? here again a private quarrel is rag∣ing which the interference of a superior, if he should also be a Christian, might presently heal. What innu∣merable opportunities also has an independent person of distributing religious books, or conveying serious ad∣vice to those whom Providence has placed under his in∣fluence. Now these are the employments which con∣stitute the calling of independent people. Christianity brings them to a strict sense of their responsibility in these and many other like points, and at the same time enlarge their hearts in love to all their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Well then, have you followed this your Christian calling, and followed it diligently during the last year? Oh! no, you are one of those perhaps who have spent the whole year in some triffling employment, merely to gratify your own taste, or to please your own vanity. These are the things which have formed your chief calling, and while the vices of the poor have been dread∣fully increasing in your parish, and the groans of the
<PB N="90" REF="035296_0184_1001C1069E863968"/>miserable have been almost reaching your door, you have been spending your little independent income on yourself and fancying that all was well.</P>
<P>But let us next address the more laboring part of the community, and if they will allow us to examine them closely, I believe it will equally appear, that a Chris∣tian principle is necessary in their case, in order to carry them through their business with real faithfulness and integrity. First, have none of you been on the whole very idle during the last year? Are there none who have slackened in their work because they thought the Parish must relieve them whenever thier idleness should have brought them to want? Are there none who have chosen rather to burthen some charitable friend than to buckle heartily to their work? And has every one of you been as diligent just after he had got a week's wa∣ges in hand as before? Now, Christianity will have led you to work at all times, not on Saturday only, but on Monday also, making conscience of habitual diligence; nay, you will have been ready (as the apostle exhorts) <HI>to work with your hands in the things that are good that you may have to give to him that needeth.</HI> And how have you employed both your time and thoughts when the regular hours of work has been over? <HI>Which of you, says</HI> Christ, <HI>having a servant ploughing or feed∣ing cattle will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and set thou down to meat, and will not rather say to him, make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me.</HI> Thus does our Sa∣viour teach us that we are all (rich indeed as well as poor) like so many servants, who when we have done serving our master in the field, must then go and serve him in the house. The Christian laborer therefore is one who has no sooner done serving Christ by his ordin∣ary calling abroad, than he proceeds next to serve the same master by his christian conduct at home, by useful conversation with his children, by reading a portion of
<PB N="91" REF="035296_0185_1001C10AF5C91AA0"/>scripture to them, and by uniting with them in prayer to the great Father of Mercies for a blessing on all the family before they lie down to rest.</P>
<P>Again, ask yourself whether you may not have been more or less an <HI>eye-servant?</HI> If you are a common gar∣dening man, have you not worked harder when the head gardener was in the garden, than when he was out of it? And if a clerk or apprentice, have you not made more speed when your employer has happened to come into the shop or counting-house? If a footman, have you been as faithful and diligent, have you risen as car∣ly, worked as steadily, gone your errands as nimbly, and turned your hand to any thing wanted of you, as readily as if your master had stood by watching you? Now, if you are a Christian servant, you will have done every thing, under the impression that One who is far greater than your earthly master, has been always at hand observing you. <HI>Servants,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>obey your masters, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</HI></P>
<P>The idleness and eye-service which have been spoken of, necessarily imply also some injustice to your employ∣er: You have agreed with him to give him so much work for so much pay; but if you have secretly wasted in idleness, or turned to your own use, a part of that time which you engaged to give your master, you have then robbed him of his due; you have as much wronged your master, as your master would have wronged you, if he had secretly taken back a part of the wages he had professed to give you, or had knowingly miscounted the money in his own favor while he was paying you.</P>
<P>Again, there are many kinds of dishonesty which are practised almost without reflection, and with a very quiet conscience, because custom is supposed to author∣ize them; the new-year, therefore, seems a very pro∣per time for examining into these points. It may in
<PB N="92" REF="035296_0186_1001C1100A1B7A88"/>general be suspected, that all profits or <HI>privileges,</HI> as they are called, which are carefully concealed, have something dishonest in them, for if they are quite hon∣est, why should they not be public? The difficulty of breaking through these customs, is often much increased by a certain false shame, which makes people afraid of doing it, least they should thereupon be charged with pretending to be better than their neighbors. Religion, however, tends to cure this false shame, for when a deep concern about the salvation of the soul arises, a man is carried above all those little feelings which so often interfere with his duty, and being obliged to turn over a new leaf in many great points, he takes the op∣portunity of rectifying a thousand smaller inadverten∣cies, which many men of the world, though accounted moral, never think of doing, because they have no motive strong enough to put them upon any kind of change.</P>
<P>We shall now name a few more subjects for self-ex∣amination, which we shall not do with much particu¦larity; since the reader's own mind may enlarge upon them.</P>
<P>How have you behaved through the last year in res∣pect to relative duties? It may not be amiss, at this time of the year, to recollect the names of our rela∣tions and connections, one by one, and then to ask our¦selves, who is there of these whom I have either hurt by my misconduct, or neglected, through idleness or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ret dislike; who is there of them whom I have put off by a little outward complaisance, when I ought to have been affectionate and kind? Again, who is there of them with whom I have too much agreed, not dar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w any Christian singularity in their presence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d conforming both to them and to the world, through fear of their ill-will? The duty subsisting between near connections, such as husbands and wives, or parents and children, ought to form at this reason of year a
<PB N="93" REF="035296_0187_1001C1145DA946E8"/>very great subject of self-examination, and that which our Christian duty dictates, will be found to contribute exceedingly to increase our private happiness.</P>
<P>Have you also in the last year been temperate, sober, and chaste, as the Scriptures require? Have you not allowed yourself to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive in any of those vices of which the Scripture says, that <HI>they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> Again, have you been combating with all your evil tempers in the last year, and what has been your success in the conflict? Every man has some particular infirmity. Some are apt to be stubborn and self-willed, others weak and yield∣ing.—Some are bold and forward, others too fearful and ashamed. Some are sleepy and inactive, others are too busy and prone to meddle even in what does not con∣cern them. Some are too silent, and others as much too talkative. Some have affections that are continu∣ally betraying them into inconveniences if not dangers, and some have an ungracious and disagreeable harshness with which they ought to contend. Some also have much natural pride, or a strong turn to vanity. Now if you are used to search out your faults, you will have long since known in some measure, which of these may be yours, and you will be glad to be reminded at the year's end that you ought to enquire how far you have gained ground on that sin which has most easily beset you.</P>
<P>We will only mention further, have you been obser∣vant of the hand of Providence in all the events that have come across you in the last year? Have you referred your sickness or your health, you losses in trade or your successes, as well as all the deaths in your family, and among your friends, together with every other inci∣dent of the year, to a Divine Providence, which has ordered all things that have befallen you. And have you considered the affronts and injuries of men, the hardships you have suffered, the national calamities al∣so, of which you may have born<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your part in the same re∣ligious
<PB N="94" REF="035296_0188_1001C11B4E611F30"/>light, namely, as the means by which God has been pleased to try you. And have you been there∣fore resigned and patient under sufferings, as well as thankful for your mercies.</P>
<P>And lastly, while you are now recollecting all the es∣capes and deliverances you have experienced, as well as the affecting deaths and changes which you have perhaps witnessed during the last twelvemonth in your family, are you led thereby to meditate on the uncer∣tainty of your own future life, and on the coming of that awful day, when <HI>we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, to give an account of the things done in the body,</HI> and when both you and <HI>all that are in their graves shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</HI></P>
<P>To this subject of self-examination, which is now closed, one important remark shall be added. Perhaps some reader will have been ready to reply to some of the strict questions which have been put to him, "Why at this rate who can be saved? If all this be necessary for salvation, I must despair and give up the point."—We would request every such desponding reader to turn this tract to the following use: let him avail him∣self of it in the first place in order to alarm his fears, and to do away that false notion of innocence, which men who never examine themselves are apt to trust to as the ground of their salvation, and when what he has read has thus convinced him of his exceeding guilt, let it then send his thoughts to that Saviour of the world <HI>whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.</HI> Let him proceed to think deeply and often on that instructive subject of <HI>his being justified freely by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</HI> a subject the powerful force of which in turn∣ing
<PB N="95" REF="035296_0189_1001BF7F893EDA10"/>the whole heart to God, the reader has perhaps not yet taken into his calculation. Encouraged by the pardon of which this doctrine assures him if he is peni∣tent, and accepting most heartily and thankfully its free and undeserved salvation, let him then account himself to be not his own, but bought with a price, and let him live no longer to himself, but to him that hath di∣ed for him. A heart warmed with gratitude to Christ will stand in place of a thousand arguments; it will make that labor more pleasant which otherwise seems intolerable: and it will cause all those duties, which we seemed to describe with so much strictness, to ap∣pear now no more than a just and reasonable service.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>TRUE EXAMPLE</HI> OF THE INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE, IN THE DISCOVERY AND PUNISHMENT OF MURDER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By that famous Magistrate, Mr. Justice Fielding.</BYLINE>
<P>IN Liecestershire, not far from Lutterworth, lived a Miller, who having a grudge against a man, had murdered him in his Mill, and privately buried him in his Garden. Not long after he had committed this horrible crime, the Miller found means to change his place of abode, and settled in another country, a great way off. Here he lived a long time, believing that his villainy would never be discovered; but this hardened
<PB N="97" REF="035296_0191_1001C127B96D5AE0"/>wretch did not reflect, that though no fellow-creature saw him, God did, and that though God is patient and long-suffering, he seldom fails to bring wicked actions to light in this world, and never fails to punish them in the next. Twenty years had now passed over his head in safety, and he thought he might, without any danger, venture to return to visit some old friends in the village where he had formerly lived. All is now safe, thought he, and it is impossible the old story should be ever brought to light.</P>
<P>Just at the very time while he was on this visit in his native village, by the Providence of God, the Miller who had present possession of the Mill, having occasion to dig uncommonly deep in his Garden found the bo∣dy, or rather the bones of the murdered man. The neighbors then recollected that about twenty years ago, a man had been missing in the Parish, and was never heard of after. Some likewise recollected who was then owner of the mill, and that very miller being now in the parish, they all ran to the house where he was, and surrounding it, call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on him as the murderer of the person whose bones had been thus providentially disco∣vered. The wretched miller was so shocked and con∣founded with the sudden and general accusation: and conscience, which had slept for twenty years, was now so horribly stung, that he soon confessed the fact, was tried, found guilty, and executed according to his just deserts.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>The following observations of this wise and famous Ma∣gistrate, being unhappily, just as well suited to the present time, as the time when that great man wrote them, I hope they may be useful to my readers.</HEAD>
<P>That the most dreadful crime of murder, hath of late years increased in a very deplorable degree in this king∣dom, is a fact which every man must confess, and which every good man must very bitterly lament. Till this age, indeed, cruel and qloody actions were so
<PB N="98" REF="035296_0192_1001A37D9D1F6608"/>seldom heard of in England, that when they happened they appeared as prodigies, and raised not only the as∣tonishment, but the abhorrence of the people. Murder is but very lately begun to be common among us.</P>
<P>For my part, I sincerely declare I can discover no more than one cause of the horrid evil of which I am complaining—One indeed, perfectly capable of produ∣cing every mischief, and which hath more than all other causes, contributed to produce, and to increase all the evils with which the public is at present extremely af∣flicted.</P>
<P>My sensible reader will presently guess what I mean. I mean that general neglect, I fear I may say con∣tempt of Religion, which hath within these few years, so fatally overspread this whole kingdom, till it has reached the very lowest ranks of men? It cannot be otherwise, for when we think of the solemn threatnings of Almighty God against the crime of Murder, how is it possible to think that a creature, who believes that there is a God, should, unless he be a fool or a mad∣man, thus audaciously fly in the face of that awful be∣ing, in whose words we must be assured is all truth, and in whose right hand is all power.</P>

<HEAD>THE TOUCH STONE; OR, THE WAY TO KNOW A TRUE CHRISTIAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a description of the character of our blessed Saviour, with an enquiry whether we are like Him. To which is added, an Appeal first to INFIDELS, and then to Persons who call themselves by the Name of CHRISTIANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Christian Country, or at least among the more Christian part of it, the duty of imitating him by whose name we call ourselves, is a point which must be allowed to be clear. I think it must also be admitted by all who consider themselves as Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, that in proportion as a man differs from his Saviour, and turns away from the consideration of his character and conduct, in the same proportion does he depart from true goodness, and betray the unsoundness of his whole Christian profession.</P>
<P>We shall proceed, without further preface, to speak of a few of those tempers and dispositions which most remarkably distinguished our blessed Lord, and they shall be the following.</P>
<P>First. He was remarkable for his <HI>condescension and humility,</HI> and for his indifference to worloly praise.—He sought not honor from men: he never aimed at earthly distinction or superiority, but submitted willing∣ly to be considered as one of the meanest of the people.
<PB N="100" REF="035296_0194_1001C3059BA00580"/>No lofty high minded thoughts, no aspiring desires were harbored in his breast. He made himself <HI>of no reputation</HI> and appeared as the servant of all. It was most wonderful condescension in Christ, who is spoken of in Scripture as <HI>coming down from Heaven,</HI> and as having partaken in <HI>the glory of the Father before the world was,</HI> even to visit this world at all. It was still greater condescension to visit us in the character of a man like ourselves, but the condescension is increased to a still more astonishing pitch, by appearing among us even as the poorest and most despised of mankind. He was destitute of such common conveniencies as even the lowest have. <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man had not where to lay his head.</HI> We find him condescending to wash his disciples' feet, and also warning them not to consi∣der themselves as true believers in him if they <HI>sought honor one of another:</HI> at another time we find him ad∣monishing them to be <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> and at another <HI>not to chuse the highest place,</HI> but willingly and contented∣ly to take the lowest till they should be called up high∣er, assuring them that it was a maxim in his kingdom, <HI>that every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> humbleth himself shall be exalted.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Our Saviour was also endued with the greatest <HI>meekness and patience.</HI> No hastiness of spirit; no rash anger or resentment was found in him. His soul was meek and gentle as a lamb: all the trials, af∣fronts, and injuries which he met with were submitted to by him patiently, without the least murmuring or repining. <HI>He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. He hid not his face from shame and spitting. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</HI> St. Peter tells us, that <HI>when he was reviled, he reviled
<PB N="101" REF="035296_0195_1001C1351A1110B0"/>not again, when he suffered he threatened not, but com∣mitted himself to him that judgeth righteously,</HI> and his own admonition to his followers is, <HI>take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls.</HI> When his enemies treated him with the greatest unkindness and cruelty, he returned them good for evil, and sought to promote their happiness and salvation. So far was his mind from harboring any malice or revenge, that he prayed even for his murderers, and recommended them to the Di∣vine Mercy, saying. <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The mind of Christ was also filled with the tenderest <HI>compassion and love.</HI> This was manifested throughout his whole conduct, by the kind attention he shewed both to the bodies and souls of men. <HI>He went about doing good,</HI> relieving the helpless, healing the diseased, and comforting the afflicted. He also in∣structed the ignorant, and <HI>gave light to them that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death.</HI> The poor guil∣ty sinner found him a friend indeed. We never read of any sinner turning from his sins, and calling upon Christ, without receiving an answer of peace, so that our Saviour shewed by his conduct that he came, as he himself expresses it, <HI>to seek and to save that which was lost.</HI> He is represented in Scripture as one who was al∣ways laboring to promote the Salvation of those around him; and when men would not hearken to his words, but determined still to go on in their sins, his soul piti∣ed them, and he was <HI>grieved for their hardness of heart</HI> How fully does his pathetic lamentation over devoted Jerusalem speak the compassionate affection of his mind! <HI>O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the Pro∣phets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how of∣ten would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035296_0196_1001A38908DDFD30"/>
But his love was shewn most eminently in his laying down his life for us: as he speaks, <HI>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</HI> This great instance of love he shewed, yet this was not all: He laid down his life for his <HI>enemies.</HI> St. Paul says, <HI>when we were yet without strength</HI> (or when we had fallen, so as to be utterly helpless and ru∣ined) <HI>in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man would one die, yet perad∣venture for a good man some would even dare to die.—But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</HI> Herein is love beyond example. We read of some who have been induced to die for their country or their friends, but where have we heard or read of any one, except Je∣sus Christ, who has willingly died for his enemies; for those who offended and cruelly injured him.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Christ was remarkable for the most per∣fect <HI>obedience and resignation to the will of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I came down from heaven,</HI> he saith, <HI>not to domine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> At twelve years old we find him diligently employed in pursuing the great object for which God sent him into the world, rea∣soning with and questioning the Jewish Doctors in the Temple. When his mother enquired of him concern∣ing the reason of his conduct, his answer was, <HI>Wist ye not thut I must be about my Father's business.</HI> He was more intent on obeying God than on receiving his dai∣ly food. <HI>I have meat to eat,</HI> said he, <HI>which the world knows not of,</HI> and immediately after he adds, <HI>my meat is to do the will of God, and to finish the work which he hath given me to do.</HI> And as he was active in per∣forming, so was he always patient in suffering what∣ever God required. All the severe trials and afflictions which Christ endured, were endured without reluctance
<PB N="103" REF="035296_0197_1001C138790F3D20"/>or repining, because he knew that they came upon him by Divine appointment. Even when his last bitter suf∣ferings drew near, and his human nature shuddered at the prospect of them, hear with what obedient resigna∣tion he prayed: <HI>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say, Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>If there were room to enlarge on this subject, we might proceed to speak of our Saviour's spotless puri∣ty, of his unshaken faith and trust in God, of his no∣ble courage in the cause of truth, and also of his ardent devotion, as well as many other shining excellencies in his character; but it is the less necessary, because they are partly implied in the tempers already treated of.</P>
<P>And now let me put a very simple question to the reader. Who are they that are the true disciples of this Jesus Christ? The answer is easy. The true disciples are those undoubtedly who most nearly resemble that character of Christ which has been spoken of. Those are not the true Christians who merely call themselves such. Again, those are not the true Christians, who, though they believe and affirm the Bible to be true, yet never read it, and know nothing of what is contained in it. Again, those are not the true Christians, who, though they may read the Bible, and though they can prove by argument that it is no imposture, are never∣theless no better for all this knowledge. Again, they are not the true Christians who have had Christian bap∣tism, who attend at Christian worship, and receive ev∣ery month the Christian Sacrament, and who are or∣thodox even in their Creed, and can see the errors into which other men fall on these subjects; for a man may still want the main thing which Christianity consists in, I mean he may want a resemblance to Christ in his turn of character, and temper, and spirit. But in order to
<PB N="104" REF="035296_0198_1001C13A33EAB1F8"/>bring this whole subject more distinctly home to the reader, let us again briefly touch on the several tempers that were spoken of.</P>
<P>First, then your Saviour was remarkable for his con∣descension, humility, and indifference to worldly praise. Are you distinguished by the same dispositions?—Are you willing to drop down from your rank in life, as Christ did from his celestial dignity? Are you content∣ed also with a low estate as he was? And is your heart deadened like his to the desire of worldly praise and re∣putation? Is this, I say, your character? Or, on the contrary, are you one of those Christians who make a point of not stooping to any employment that is judged beneath them, and who are continually aiming at high acquaintance, whose great anxiety is also to fare plenti∣fully in this world, and who, in short, are in full chace of wealth, as well as reputation, honor, and preferment? This is one test by which you are to judge whether you are a Christian.</P>
<P>Secondly. We spoke of the meekness and patience of Christ. When he was <HI>reviled, he reviled not again.</HI> His soul, as we observed, was meek and gentle as a lamb. Is this also your character? Has your natural temper, if it is hasty, been brought under, so that af∣fronts and injuries do not much ruffle you? Are you not made violent in your spirit by the violence of those who are opposed to you? How do you feel, for instance, towards men of an opposite nation, or of a contrary party to you in politics, or of another sect in religion? Christ died for his enemies; how do you feel towards all your enemies? Do you bear the evils of life also as Christ did, without murmuring and complaining, sub∣mitting cheerfully to a hard and humble lot, if it be the will of your heavenly Father?</P>
<P>Thirdly. Christ was full of tender compassion, and love, both to the bodies and souls of men. How stands the likeness in these particulars? For instance, what
<PB N="105" REF="035296_0199_1001C13EF2D95580"/>part of your time and money do you give to the relief of men's bodily distresses? Is your character that of a father to the fatherless, a visitor of the sick, a benefac∣tor to the poor, and a comforter of the afflicted? Do you like your Saviour, <HI>go about doing good?</HI> How do you act also to those who are of bad character in the world, and who have trespassed, as some judge, past all forgiveness? Does your benevolence embrace even these outcasts also? It was one of the reproaches cast on Christ by the Pharisees, that he stooped too low in this respect, and that he seemed to take the part of wicked and undeserving people. <HI>Behold!</HI> said they, <HI>a friend to publicans and sinners,</HI> and again, <HI>this woman is a sin∣ner.</HI> Are you in like manner a friend to the most dis∣creditable kind of sinners? Is the idea of their unwor∣thiness no argument with you for declining an opportu∣nity of doing them good? Do you take their part and not despair of them, notwithstanding the sneers of some unchristian people? Or, on the contrary, does the dread of suffering in your own reputation continually check you in the just exercise of your beneficence?</P>
<P>But the love of Christ had respect chiefly to the souls of men. Are you chiefly concerned about their souls al∣so? Do you do what in you lieth to promote men's e∣ternal interests? Do you labor to enlighten, to instruct, to invite, and to warn men with all earnestness, as Christ did? and do you weep over the cause of impenitent sinners, as your Saviour wept over Jerusalem? Or, on the contrary, are you one of those who make light of men's spiritual interests, who seem almost to forget that their fellow-creatures have immortal souls, and who at the utmost can only be prevailed on to shew a little hu∣manity to their bodies?</P>
<P>Fourthly. Christ was remarkable for his obedience and resignation to the will of God. He evidently liv∣ed only for the purpose of doing the will of his Hea∣venly Father. Is this the proposed end of your living?
<PB N="106" REF="035296_0200_1001A3E0CF57B818"/>Do you consider all your employments in this life as the fulfilling of a work which God hath given you to do, and do you labor to know his will in order to your thus fulfilling it? Or, on the contrary, are you one of those who never think of God's will, but go their own way and say, they have a right to please themselves pro∣vided they commit no great crime against their neigh∣bor. And again, when crosses or troubles come upon you, do you bear them with resignation, considering them to be sent by God, or are you impatient until they are removed, reversing on such occasions the language of your Saviour and saying, "not thy will, O Lord! but mine be done."</P>
<P>On the subject of our Saviour's holiness and purity, his unshaken faith and trust in God, his boldness in the cause of truth, and his ardent devotion, as well as his other excellencies, we will not attempt to enter here.—Let it be remembered, however, that it is the part of a true Christian to trace out the whole character of his Saviour and to imitate him in every one of those points in which the Scriptures set him forth as an example.</P>
<P>And now let us make an appeal in a few words to two or three different descriptions of people. And first to the downright Infidel. You are one who disbe∣lieve in Christ, but are you one that has duly weighed and considered his character? What is the fault you find in it? When the unbelieving Jews once took up stones to cast at J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus, he answered them by saying, <HI>Many good works have I shewed you from my Father, and for which of these good works do you stone me?</HI> And so it may be said to you now. Many excellencies in Christ's character have been set before you, and for which of these is it that you disbelieve in him? Surely you cannot deny that there is something very excellent and unimpeachable, something very pure and holy, some∣thing also very original, something in short that looks very like divine in the character that has been spoken of, nor
<PB N="107" REF="035296_0201_1001C141671664B8"/>can there be any do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of the tendency of the disposi∣tions which have been described to promote the peace and happiness of mankind. When therefore one man scoffs, when another gravely disbelieves, when a third doubts about Christianity; when difficulties rise up in the minds of some, and when profane and blaspheming books are spread abroad to overthrow the faith of others, to all this host of unbelievers we beg leave in this place simply to reply, by opposing to them the character of Jesus Christ, a character which those who are the most violent in running down Christianity, will be found I believe in general, to take very little trouble in consi∣dering.</P>
<P>When those unbelieving Jews of old who were so bent on crucifying Christ were asked, <HI>Why what evil hath he done?</HI> the grand difficulty was, to get ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to give their attention fairly to the character of the prisoner; the multitude of them, when this very reasonable ques∣tion was asked, are said to have returned to their gener∣al abuse, and to have <HI>only cried out the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et him be crucified;</HI> but when Pilate, though disposed to side with the Jews, was obliged by his office to examine and cross-examine this Jesus, <HI>Verily,</HI> said Pilate, <HI>I find no fault in him.</HI> Our present difficulty is much the same; for if we could but persuade our modern infidels and blasphemers to bestow for once a little time in examin∣ing, point by point, the character of this Jesus of Na∣zareth as Pilate did, methinks they would be glad to wash their hands also, like Pilate, of the blame of being his more forward enemies: they would turn over at least the heavier part of the guilt to the rabble of more uninformed persons saying, like Pilate after the exam∣ination, <HI>Take ye him, and crucify him.</HI></P>
<P>But let us next address the merely nominal and false Christians. Now these are the persons who, though some of them lament perhaps the present growth of in∣fidelity, have been the principal causes of it. Not a few
<PB N="108" REF="035296_0202_1001C14927707368"/>of these Christians so called are, it is to be feared, men even of immoral character, and these must be named a∣mong the best friends of infidelity, for the corrupt life of one who calls himself a Christian, is certainly the greatest of all encouragements to the unbeliev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. But let us not confine our observations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> immoral Christians only. You are certainly a promoter of infidelity if you do but fail of having that peculiar temper and turn of mind which has been described. I will suppose now that you are a decent moral person—but must we not own that so also are many of the infidels—honorable—so are the infidels—humane, perhaps handsome in your conduct, and very respectable—but so also are many of the infidels. If this then be all, you have nothing in your character but what is common both to you and them, and an infidel at this rate is just as good as a Chris∣tian; and if as good he must be as safe also—surely then there is no need of Christianity: and if there is no need of it there arises a strong suspicion also that there is no truth in it; for to suppose Christianity to be true, and sent of God, as it professes to be, while nevertheless there is no need of it, and while the followers of it are no better than the unbelievers, is to suppose that God acts foolishly and in vain, which supposition is itself a kind of infidelity, and is an approach even to Atheism. It follows, therefore, that in order to defend the truth of Christianity, it is necessary to exclude out of the pale of the true Christian Church every such merely decent Christian as I have been speaking of, saying to him (as all serious Christians indeed are used to do) that you have no share in the privileges of the Gospel any more than the unbelievers, and if <HI>he that believeth not shall be condemned,</HI> then you, it is to be seared, are involved in the same condemnation.</P>
<P>We cannot help observing that Christians of this merely decent class, especially if possessed of a little or∣thodoxy also, are not seldom the persons who cry out
<PB N="109" REF="035296_0203_1001C14E94E9AB10"/>most violently against infidelity, and who perhaps come forward in defence of the national faith, as if these were the best champions by whom the truths of Christ can be defended; whereas I think I have shewn, that they are some of the very persons who have betrayed the cause, and have surrendered up the ark of our most holy faith into the hands of the modern Philistines.</P>
<P>Let us next address another class of persons, I mean those who are very remarkable for their attachment to certain Christian doctrines, and are very zealous for what they call the Gospel. Some of these perhaps carry their zeal for doctrines so far, that they feel but little interest in any thing that can be said concerning the example of Christ, and are ready to turn away from what they call so merely moral a lesson. They desire to hear of nothing else than the <HI>blood and righteousness of Christ,</HI> and his atonement, and grace, and intercession. But has not the same Scripture which speaks on these sub∣jects said also, <HI>Let the same mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, and that Christ hath set us an ex∣ample that we should tread in his steps:</HI> and again, <HI>that he that saith he abideth in Him ought himself so to walk even as He walked:</HI> and again, <HI>that if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,</HI> (which certainly must include the temper or Christ) <HI>he is none of His.</HI> A plain Scrip∣tural declaration of the character of Christ, and an ap∣peal to those texts which assert the necessity of being like Him in our own character and conduct, may be of admirable use in pulling down the vain confidence of the enthusiast, in rectifying many errors of the bigot, in exposing the sinful passions of some who pretend that they are magnifying Christ, in proving in short the faith of all, and in calming many political as well as religious controversies of the Christian Church.</P>
<P>But once more. There are some who think indeed that they copy after Christ, and that they copy him the more because they make light of doctrines and bestow
<PB N="110" REF="035296_0204_1001C152C2EB3910"/>their whole attention upon practice. But what is their practice? Are they close and real imitators of all these holy tempers of Jesus? I fear those who neglect or per∣vert the doctrinal parts of Scripture in order to suit their own creed, are prone equally to forget or lower what is practical in Scripture in order to suit their own prac∣tice: many take, for instance, only a part of Christ's example instead of the whole of it, and even what they take they lower and deprive of all the spirit that is in it before they can agree to it: thus they may possibly im∣itate Christ's benevolence to the bodies of men, but e∣ven this is done only in some small degree, for they can∣not be said to <HI>go about doing good,</HI> as Christ did, making their benevolence their business, and quitting their home, like him, in search of wretched people; and as to Christ's benevolence to the <HI>souls</HI> of men, they hardly think of it, and are altogether opposite to him in that particular: thus many also may consider a certain degree of resigna∣tion to Providence in a time of calamity to be a branch of Christian duty, and may fancy they follow Christ's example in this respect, while in fact perhaps they are much more influenced by an idea of it's being necessa∣ry to submit to their fate; and as to that other temper of Christ which we coupled with willingness to suffer. I mean a willingness also to <HI>do</HI> the whole will of our Heavenly Father. Here they most l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mentably fail: for do they look upon the doing of God's will, as Christ did, to be more necessary, as it were, than their daily meat, and do they count their time, their money, and their labor, lost except as it is devoted to God's service, and employed for His glory? In truth, the whole example of Christ, when rightly understood, can neither be im∣itated nor approved by the common kind of worldly men; and indeed we all seem naturally to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll into dispo∣sitions the most contrary to those which characterised our Saviour; for are men <HI>naturally</HI> humble, and lowly, and indifferent, as he was to wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly praise. Are they
<PB N="111" REF="035296_0205_1001C159162CF8B0"/><HI>naturally</HI> prone to forgive injuries, and to love even their enemies, shewing their chief compassion also to the souls of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose whom they love? Are men <HI>naturally</HI> dispo∣sed to renounce their own will, and to look only to the will of God? And are men <HI>naturally</HI> sumissive, and resigned, and devoted altogether, to the Lord's service? The corruption of our nature then is one of the lessons which we learn by thus appealing to the example of Christ as the Touchstone of real goodness, and when through the knowledge of this corruption we are hum∣bled under the sense of guilt, and are become anxious to find mercy, then, and not till then, we turn to our Saviour's cross, and begin heartily to plead <HI>the propitia∣tion</HI> of that Son of God who <HI>bare our sins in His own body on the tree,</HI> having <HI>given His own life to be a ran∣som for us.</HI></P>
<P>The distance at which we find ourselves from the Great Standard of perfection, and the difficulty which we soon begin to feel when we endeavor to copy after it, cannot fail to teach us another lesson in Christianity of the first importance: we are now taught, I mean, to <HI>bow our knees</HI> before the God of all grace, imploring him <HI>to help our infirmities,</HI> and to pour down upon us a portion of that Spirit which was <HI>given without measure</HI> unto Christ; and thus do the several parts of Christian∣ity reflect mutual light on each other. He then is the true Christian who, believing the doctrines of Christ, is also animated thereby to follow all the precepts of his Master, who heartily approves and zealously copies after the bright example that is set before him, and who, by the help of Divine Grace, attains in his humble mea∣sure to some true resemblance of his Saviour.</P>

<HEAD>ONESIMUS; OR, THE RUN-AWAY SERVANT CONVERTED <HI>A TRUE STORY,</HI> SHEWING What a wonderful Improvement in his Condition O∣NESIMUS experienced after he became a Christian.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO WHICH IS ADDED, An affectionate Adddress to all those unhappy Persons, both Men and Women, who, like ONESIMUS, have left their Home, and have got into a bad Way of living, and who have also a Mind to hear how they may get out.</HEAD>
<P>ONESIMUS was a servant (or slave) in the house of one Philemon. This Philemon seems to have been remarkable for being a good Christian, for the Apostle Paul particularly mentions his <HI>love and faith to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s the Lord Jesus, and towards all saints.</HI> It is plain then that Onesimus must have had great advanta∣ges by living in the house of such a master; and one would think that he must have been a good Christian also. No, he was far otherwise. He was quite insen∣sible of his advantages. Although there is said to have been <HI>a Church,</HI> that is, a collection of worshipping Christians, in Philemon's house, yet Onesimus seems to have been not at all the better for it. He received no doubt the instructions, he attended regularly at the fa∣mily prayers, he also beheld daily the bright example of Philemon, and yet his heart continued to be hardened.
<PB N="113" REF="035296_0207_1001C15FF89E8D78"/>I should think it probable that Onesimus was very blind and ignorant respecting religion, and also very careless about it, so that all the spiritual instruction he received would go in at one ear, as the saying is, and go out at the other. In the mean time, temptations of various kinds would probably come upon him, and thus he would advance from bad to worse, for one sin common∣ly leads on to another, and at length his heart being dreadfully hardened, he would be ready for almost any wickedness. It seems by St. Paul's account, that he became an unfaithful servant, and actually robbed his master, and that he then ran away (perhaps then taking his booty with him) to the great city of Rome, where it would be easy for Onesimus to conceal himself, just as it is easy for a man who has played the villain some∣where at a distance in this country, to lie hid in London now.</P>
<P>If the present story were to stop here, where then, it might be said is the use of having all these family prayers and this <HI>Church in the house?</HI> Why the very servants you instruct will still cheat you just as much as if they were not instructed, and it is as well therefore to leave them to go their own way, without trying to make them religious. I will not stop to reply to this obser∣vation here, because, as we go on with the story, the answer will be plain enough.</P>
<P>What I have next to remark of Onesimus, is, that when he got to Rome, he went to hear the Apostle preach. We are not told the reason of his first attend∣ing on the Apostle. It is not improbable, however, that some qualm of conscience might put him upon this visit. Methinks I see him for a few days o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weeks rioting in vice, spending freely the handful of plunder which he had carried off, and as his pocket grows low, becoming low in spirits also. At length his last shilling is gone. Alas! he has no Christian master to support him, no friend to pity him—and now having first doubt∣ed
<PB N="114" REF="035296_0208_1001A395698C1FA8"/>possibly whether to plunge into some new crime in order to relieve his growing distresses, he bethinks him∣self of what he had once so carelessly hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Phile∣mon's house, and says within his heart "well, there can be no comfort, no hope, no chance of deliverance for me now, but from the Gospel." I think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s also possi∣ble that he might have occasionally overheard the name of Paul mentioned while he was waiting at Philemon's table, and when pricked in his conscience at Rome.— Paul therefore is the man to whom he would naturally fly for relief.</P>
<P>Let no master then despair of being an instrument of good to his servants, even though for a time he should see no fruit of his labors. I am persuaded there has been many a footman, or stable boy, or other servant, both male and female, who has continued thoughtless and profane during the whole time of residence in a re∣ligious master's house, and who nevertheless has been struck to the heart afterwards, and has profited materially in the end, by some hint which appeared to have no ef∣fect at the time of receiving it.</P>
<P>But we are next to speak of a new scene which pre∣sents itself. Onesimus is converted to Christianity un∣der Paul's ministry. The sinner is convicted of his sin. Through God's mercy the run-away is arrested in his mad and-wicked course. The poor guilty wretch of course cofnesses to Paul his guilt, and through the infi∣nite grace of God in Christ he obtains pardon, and the hope of eternal life.</P>
<P>Here then is a striking proof of the provision of mer∣cy which there is in the Gospel. A run-away slave and a thief may become a partaker of it: God can grant even to the vilest and most miserable sinner re∣pentance unto life; and it is proper therefore, that all should pray to God for a heart to repent, and that no one should despair.</P>
<P>It is plain from many signs that the repentance of
<PB N="115" REF="035296_0209_1001C166DD175F58"/>Onesimus was sincere. In the first place I think we may take Paul's word that it was so, for Paul would not have spoken so decidedly as he did, if he had not first enquired into the case. No; I will warrant you Paul examined Onesimus very closely, for Paul's charity did not consist in believing in a good-natured way that ev∣ery one was a Christian who said that he was so; on the contrary, Paul's charity led him to be careful and jealous lest he should comfort his flock with a false hope, or should flatter the person of any one. It made him therefore exceedingly particular in examining the state of men's souls: and hence it comes to pass that the words of Paul have so much weight whenever he pronounces any one to be a Christian.</P>
<P>But the sincerity of Onesimus's repentance is still further proved by a circumstance which is distinctly men∣tioned; I mean by his readiness to take Paul's advice when he bids him to go back again to his injured master. Now a false penitent would differ from Onesimus in this particular. A false penitent would make a thou∣sand objections to such a measure. "What," he would say "must I go back to my master whom I have wrong∣ed? I dare not shew my face before him, nor before my fellow-servants. I shall sink into the earth when I see them. Besides, where is the necessity for returning? I am willing to repent indeed, but may I not repent at Rome? Surely I may be allowed to remain here in my present obscurity, for the disgrace of seeing my master and all my old friends again is more than I can bear, but I will bear any thing else; I will live hard and work honestly, and I will be very sorry for my sin, and I will continue to attend Paul's preaching. Surely this will suffice." "But go back again in the first place to your master," says Paul. "Go and own to him what you have done; away with all this pride and evil shame which is about you. Submit to the disgrace you have brought on yourself, and try to repair the evil you have
<PB N="116" REF="035296_0210_1001C16D5FD94E18"/>done as well as you can, by working hard for Philemon in the time to come: endeavor to earn <HI>for</HI> him as much money as you have stolen <HI>from</HI> him, and be not afraid of Philemon's wrath, for I will give you a letter to him. This is the proof I require of your sincerity."</P>
<P>How wise and judicious was this advice of Paul to Onesimus! <HI>Whom,</HI> says he in the letter <HI>I have sent a∣gain,</HI> that is, whom I have sent back again in order that he may confess his whole fault to you, and return into your service. The confession of the sin against Philemon was better in this case than any general con∣fession of faith, or than any plausible tale of Onesimus's conversion; and so it may be observed in other cases, that a readiness to go back at all hazards, and to ac∣knowledge our crime to the person we have offended, and to repair it as well as we are able, is the first proof of sincerity that should be required; whereas an unwil∣lingness to return implies much remaining pride of heart, a very sinful sort of shame, a disregard to strict honesty, and a fear of consequences that is inconsistent with that faith and trust in God which accompany true repentance.</P>
<P>Onesimus, as I have said, consented to return; and let us not suppose that he is now to be pitied on that account, or that any great miseries were in consequence about to fall upon his head. No, let us congratulate him rather on his right resolution, for I will warrant you, that after the first affecting scene was over, he would be much the happier for it, and let us remember also, that we are to consider him now as a Christian, who has got among Christian people, and that he de∣parts bearing in his hand that letter of St. Paul to Phil∣emon, which I have spoken of, and which forms one of the short Books or Epistles of the New Testament.— How kind, how affectionate, how condescending does every part of this Epistle appear, when carefully exami∣ned! It is a specimen of the Christian spirit, and we
<PB N="117" REF="035296_0211_1001C172698F6780"/>shall therefore now turn from Onesimus's character to the contemplation of that of Paul, which we have here a fine opportunity of considering.</P>
<P>Paul was now grown extremely old, and he had suf∣fered much in the cause of the Gospel. He was at this very time a prisoner, and it was while in prison and in bonds that he had preached so effectually to Onesimus. It is likewise remarkable that not only Onesimus the slave, but that Philemon the master also, to whom the letter was addressed, had been converted through Paul's ministry. Thus, therefore, this venerable Saint was able to write with the authority that belonged to him both as an apostle, as an old man, and as Philemon's father in Christ, as the father in like manner of Onesi∣mus, and as a chief sufferer, who was soon also to prove a noble martyr, in the cause of their common Sa∣viour.</P>
<P>What then is the ground which he may be supposed to take in order to persuade Philemon to spare the poor converted slave that is sent back to him? The ground he takes is this: He forbears, he says, from that exer∣cise of his authority which such a one as he might use; he hints, in a most affecting manner, how Philemon himself had owed the life of his very soul to the apostle, and he then entreats Philemon, for love's sake, to com∣ply with the earnest request that is made to him, briefly intimating also the worldly profit which Philemon would derive from having now a Christian servant instead of an unbelieving one. But let us quote the apostle's own words—<HI>wherefore,</HI> says he, <HI>though I might be bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet, for love's sake, I rather beseech thee, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ; I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have be∣gotten in my bonds, which in times past was to thee un∣profitable, but is now profitable to thee and to me, whom I have sent again, thou therefore receive him that is
<PB N="118" REF="035296_0212_1001C174E2A81200"/>mine own bowels.</HI> And then he adds, <HI>Thou therefore receive him not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto thee both in the frish and in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>What an astonishing difference does Christianity make in men! What a kind of spirit do we here trace! How strange also must all this love and condescension seem to some people! A man of the world, whose ser∣vant had robbed him and run away, would never be∣lieve Christianity could convert the man, and would disdain to receive such a kind of letter as I have descri∣bed. I am persuaded also my readers will agree, that a worldly correspondent, though naturally ever so hu∣mane, would be very far from writing such a kind of letter as this; and certainly an unrepenting and world∣ly minded flave would ill deserve to have it written.— But how affectionately does Paul still proceed—<HI>If,</HI> says Paul, <HI>thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account. I Paul have written in with mine own hand, I will repay it. Albeit, I do not say to thee how thou owest to me thine own self besides.</HI></P>
<P>And now let it be remarked, what a happy influence had Christianity on the whole condition of this poor wretched run-away. He was sinking, no doubt, into the lowest infamy as well as poverty and woe when he first waited on Paul: he was living, I dare say, among the dregs of the people at Rome; and if he had remain∣ed unconverted, if either he had not gone to Paul, or if having gone to him, he had again hardened his heart, and returned to his former wickedness, he would prob∣ably have ended his days on the Crucifix or Gibbet, or at least he would have soon perished through want, un∣known and unregarded, for he would have been swept away among the thousands whom the vice and wicked∣ness of every great city are continually sending to an untimely grave: A guilty conscience also would have
<PB N="119" REF="035296_0213_1001C17A25978CE8"/>haunted him in his last hours, and after death he must have stood before an offended God, and at last he must have had his portion in that place where <HI>there is weep∣ing, and wailing, and gnashiug of teeth.</HI></P>
<P>How happy then I say, how transporting was the change! The pride of his heart being first subdued through that blessed Gospel which was made known to him, he returns to his master. This was a great step. He returns to slavery indeed, but to a slavery no doubt that was extremely mild, and that scarcely deserved the name; for he is immediately received even as a brother into the family from whence he had fled as a culprit, and the same epistle of Paul which introduced him to Philemon, would now recommend him, no doubt, to many members of the Church at Colussus, with whom he would become united in the bonds of Christian love. Nay, if we believe the report of history, his good con∣duct as a slave soon afterwards gained him his liber∣ty, and he even rose, as some have supposed (though of this there may be a certain degree of doubt) to the situation of a Minister or Teacher of the infant Chris∣tian Church.</P>
<P>But whatever his condition may have been during the remainder of his days on earth (and it is indeed com∣paratively of little moment) of this at least we are sure, that his everlasting happiness was secured, and that he is now numbered among the company or those <HI>who have washed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</HI> whose offences in this life are pardoned through the merits of Christ, and who are <HI>standing before the throne of God.</HI> There the great apostle Paul, and his excellent friend. Philemon, and there also the converted slave Onesimus, unite with one voice in that triumphant song (God grant that each of us may one day join in it) <HI>unto him that hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and the Father,
<PB N="120" REF="035296_0214_1001C17F5661DFA8"/>unto him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.—Amen.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>An Application of the above Story to the case of those unhappy Men and Women, who, like Onesimus, have lest their home and have got into a bad way of life.</HEAD>
<P>THE story which we have related, may be useful to persons of every class, but there is a very particular application of it which may be made to those who, in some measure, resemble the run-away and unconverted Onesimus.</P>
<P>I mean now, therefore, to address myself to those who, through some false step in life, and perhaps by adding one piece of misconduct to another, have sallen into any very distressful and disgraceful circumstances. I address myself more especially to those unhappy wo∣men, who, like Onesimus, have run away from their proper home, where once perhaps they may have heard something of the Gospel, though they did not attend to it, and who are now ruined in their character, who are also plunged by their growing necessities into a life of open and allowed sin, and are perishing both as to body and soul, either in our great towns, or among the dregs of the people of our metropolis.</P>
<P>I would entreat such persons to consider a little the case of this poor Onesimus, at the time he was plunged, as I have supposed him to have been, in the debauche∣ries of Rome, and when he must be viewed as a run∣away, and even a thief and a vagabond. Methinks he resembled, in a few leading particulars, what some of you may be at present. Now it happened that Onesi∣mus went one day to hear Paul preach. What if you were for once in your lives, to do the same? I mean, what if you were to go and hear the preaching of some faithful and zealous Minister of Christ, some follower of Paul the Apostle? I would advise you, if you think of doing it at all, to go on the very next Sabbath.—
<PB N="121" REF="035296_0215_1001C180F79EFBB0"/>Onesimus, by hearing Paul preach, was delivered out of all his troubles, for he was effectually converted to Christianity; and who knows whether if you pursue the same means, it may not please God to save you both body and soul, in the same manner, Indeed, I can hardly imagine any other way than that which One∣simus actually took, by which he could have been re∣covered; and, depend upon it, if ever you escape, and are restored to peace, to happiness, and to society, it must be by the same mighty power of the Gospel.— Would to God, that some unhappy creature, who reads this tale, and who has imitated Onesimus in his wan∣derings, might imitate him also in his repentance.— Would to God, that some lost sheep might thus be brought back into the sold of Christ. Would to God, that some Prodigal Son, for instance, might be persua∣ded, like the Prodigal in the Gospel, to repent, and re∣turn to his father's house; or that some woman, who is a sinner, while she is reading this tale, might find her eyes begin to stream with tears, like the Magdalen, who wept so plentifully at the feet of our Saviour, and might, like her, attain to a comfortable and well ground∣ed hope, that <HI>her sins, which are many,</HI> are forgiven her.</P>
<P>"But what can we do," methinks I hear a whole multitude of such persons reply, "We long to be resto∣red to all the comforts you speak of; we are charmed at the very mention of such happiness, but we know not how to get possession of it." I answer, do then in all respects like Onesimus. Take example as far as your case will allow, from all the various circumstances which may be supposed to have belonged to his tale.— First of all, he attended Paul's preaching, after which, I suppose, he called on the Apostle, and told him his story. The Apostle, indeed, was a poor man himself, and a prisoner also; so that a little good advice (which, however, is a very valuable thing) was all that could
<PB N="122" REF="035296_0216_1001C18377EDC790"/>be got from him; except, indeed, that Paul being ac∣quainted with a number of good Christians, among whom there might be some rich ones also, he was able to give Onesimus a letter of introduction, if he thought proper. The same thing, perhaps, may happen now. If you will call on some Minister of the Gospel, after having for a while attended his preaching, provided he judges you to be truly penitent, he will be induced, perhaps, if poor himself, to give you a recommenda∣tion to some Christian friend of his, to some capital house-keeper, like Philemon.</P>
<P>But, shall I tell you what will be his difficulty? A suspicion will immediately arise about your sincerity, and the removal of this suspicion is the great thing which you must aim at. Onesimus succeeded in re∣moving this suspicion from the mind of Paul; for if he had not, I am sure Paul would never have written such a letter as he did to Philemon.</P>
<P>Let me, then, close with a little advice as to this point, I mean as to the manner in which you must give proof of your sincerity.</P>
<P>First, when you confess your faults to any one of whom you ask help, do not confess them by halves. I have known some persons acknowledge a sew things which they have done wrong, and which, indeed, they could not hide, while they have been mightily reserved upon other points. They have left out half their story. They have thought, perhaps, to spare themselves here∣by, but, in fact, it has commonly proved, that what was concealed was afterwards discovered, and they have been rejected, not at all on account of any unwilling∣ness to help them, though hitherto ever so wicked, but on account of its continuing still to be impossible to put any trust in them. Onesimus, I warrant you, confes∣sed his whole sin to Paul, and was not detected after∣wards in any little reservations, or excuses, or false co∣lorings.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="035296_0217_1001C1889D79F1B8"/>
Again, draw nearer and nearer to religion. Read the Scriptures. Avoid bad company. Attend diligent∣ly on the preaching of the Gospel; and endeavor to make acquaintance with those who attend also, and who, however poor, are religious. Onesimus had be∣come one among the little society of the <HI>Saints which were at Rome,</HI> at the time when Paul wrote so confi∣dently of his sincerity.</P>
<P>Again, put away your pride and false shame; very forlorn and wicked people are often very proud, and this pride works in a thousand ways, so as to hinder their deliverance. Onesimus submitted to go back to his old master, notwithstanding all the shame that at∣tended his return; and you must shew something of the same temper, if you expect any one who understands the human heart, so as all Christians do, to put confi∣dence in your sincerity.</P>
<P>Again, put your trust in Crod. Dare to fulfil your present duty; and do not reason too much about conse∣quences. God has all events, and he has likewise all hearts in his hand; and he can and will make a way for your escape, as he did for that of Onesimus, if you re∣selve fully to fear him, and put your trust in him.</P>
<P>Again, determine on a life of industry; tor all idle∣ness in you must be dishonesty. Onesimus went and worked even as a slave. I hope you have no objection to go and work any where as a servant, and to accept even the lowest service. I hope too, you desire to be a very diligent and profitable servant. <HI>Onesimus,</HI> as St. Paul observes, <HI>had been once unprofitable, but was now profitable.</HI> He became a most valuable hard-work∣ing man when he became a Christian.</P>
<P>But, above all things, take care to be what you wish to appear; take care, I mean, to be a most sincere and true penitent. It is a small matter to seem sincere in the sight of your fellow creatures, when you are not so in the sight of God. The heart is deceitrul. Enter, there∣fore,
<PB N="124" REF="035296_0218_1001C18A8C09F478"/>deeply into this matter. Consider your own weakness in times past; fly from temptation; be often on your knees also confessing your sins, and praying to God to strengthen you by his Holy Spirit; pray to him in short, <HI>to search and to try you, to prove you, and ex∣amine your ways, to look well if there be any way of wickedness in you, and to lead you in the way everlasting.</HI></P>
<P>And now, are you still out of spirits and desponding? Do you still think there is no friend to pity you, no help near you, and that no Minister, if you should go to him, will take notice of your case? I will add ano∣ther hint on this subject. When Onesimus first went to Paul, I dare say be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le expected to get such a kind letter as he obtained. Shall I then explain to you what was the cause which made Paul condescend so readily to this poor, repenting sinner. It was this. Paul was once a great sinner himself; he could remember a time, when (though he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as a thief or a run-away) yet he was a hinderer of the Gospel, and even a persecutor also. But Paul had obtained mercy, and now it became the happiness of his life to tell of the grace of Jesus Christ. <HI>Unto me,</HI> said he, <HI>who am less than the least of all Saints, is this grace given that I should preach a∣mong the Gentil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the unsearchable riches of Christ.—</HI> He thought it the greatest honor in the world to be al∣lowed to publish among the vilest Gentiles, the salva∣tion of the blessed Jesus. So is it also now. The very best men on earth, whether Christian Ministers, or Christian People, like Paul, owe all to mercy, and they long therefore to commend you to the same mercy, and to stretch out their hand for your relief.</P>
<P>Learn, then, to understand the true hindrance to your recovery. It is not that there are no Christians who will help you. It is not there are no means of de∣liverance for you, for we have shewn you that "if there is a will there is a way." It is not that you are driven i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to sin by an irresist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fate, for God is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove fate,
<PB N="125" REF="035296_0219_1001A39E690A5900"/>and God drives no man into sin. It is, in short, your own fault, and your own fault alone. Escape, then, immediately. Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eye-lids, till you have taken some step towards your recovery. Remember, in short, that if Onesimus escaped, so may you; and that if you use not the same means, this very story of Onesimus will rise up in judgment against you.</P>

<HEAD>LOOK AT HOME; OR, THE ACCUSERS ACCUSED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being an account of the manner in which our Saviour put to silence the Scribes and Pharisees, when they brought to him the Woman taken in Adultery.</HEAD>
<P>A Great man used to say that he never saw a crim∣inal dragged to execution without asking himself, "Who knows whether this poor fellow may not, on the whole, be guilty of less sin than I am?" This is a question which it would be well if we would all of us put to ourselves, when we see any of our fellow-creatures punished; for I am persuaded, that many of us have sins, which all things considered, deserve the rod just as much as the sins of those people who endure chastisement for them. I am sorry to add, that in gene∣ral, we are so far from putting to ourselves any such question as I have spoken of, that we do what is di∣rectly the contrary. We contrive to praise, instead of taking occasion to blame ourselves, when we see ano∣ther in fault. We immediately say, "Well, I thank
<PB N="126" REF="035296_0220_1001C19203B85CB0"/>God, I never did any thing so bad as this. I never in my life did what Mr. Such-a-one has done. I am not so bad as he, however;" and then we fall foul on his whole character, and think to shew our goodness by the extreme severity which we use in speaking of him.</P>
<P>Never was this temper better exposed, or the evil of it reproved, than in the case of which I am now going to speak; I mean on the occasion of the Scribes and Pharisees bringing before our Saviour the woman taken in adultery.</P>
<P>We read, that <HI>as Christ was teaching in the temple, they brought to him this woman, and set her in the midst, saying to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery.</HI> Now, since adultery is certainly a most dreadful sin, we might at first view be ready to praise these men, and also to say, "<HI>What holy and good peo∣ple must these be! wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t haters of sin! what friends to God and religion! they, to be sure, must be quite pure and perfect!</HI> Alas! how should we be mistaken if we were to judge thus of them! They were men, no doubt, who had taken some pains to wash the outside clean, and they were in good repute with their neigh∣bors; nevertheless, as this story will shew, they were all the while very wicked in their hearts; they brought this woman before Christ, and placed her in the midst, from a very wrong motive, for they did it not for the sake of glorifying God, not for the sake of punishing sin in this instance, in order to prevent it in others; and not therefore through any love to God, or charity to their neighbor; but, on the contrary, they acted from some of the basest dispositions, for they felt no compas∣sion for the woman, and they wanted only to lay a trap for Christ, in order that they might have matter of ac∣cusation against him.</P>
<P>How common is it for people, now-a-days, in some respects, to imitate these Scribes and Pharisees! What curiosity have some men, in the first place, to discover,
<PB N="127" REF="035296_0221_1001C198534482A8"/>and then to publish all the faults and infirmities of their neighbors! Some there are, who spend half their lives in listening to, and repeating all the scandal that is pas∣sing. When they hear of a man that has been overta∣ken by a sin, or of a woman that has lost her reputa∣tion, one would think that they had heard one of the best pieces of news that had ever reached their ears; for how does conversation run on, and the spirits rise, and the wit abound, when the fall of a fellow-crea∣ture is the topic of the company! The Scribes and Pharisees brought this woman forth, and set her in the midst. Just so, methinks, would the persons I am bla∣ming set every offender whom they accuse in the midst of the company, if they were able, for they shew by their language that they delight to expose every one as much as possible. But why, I repeat it, is all this ill-nature? Are these accusers spotless in their own lives? Are they better even than those whom they accuse? No; I believe it has often happened that the very man who has been most forward in condemning another, has been himself guilty of the same fault, and liable to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very same condemnation. It is the most wicked part of the world that is commonly the most severe. Your harsh judges are often the very worst of men.</P>
<P>The words used by the Scribes and Pharisees, when they brought this woman to Christ, were the follow∣ing: Said they, <HI>Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned, but what sayest thou?</HI> The design evidently was to put a difficulty in the way of Christ, and, if possible, to set him and Moses at variance; for if, on the one hand, Christ should say that the woman ought to be released, this would be contradicting Mo∣ses, and Christ would then have been called a false Prophet; but if, on the other hand, Christ should or∣der her to be stoned, this they might think would di∣minish something from the mercifulness of his character as a Savior, and would hurt his credit with the people;
<PB N="128" REF="035296_0222_1001C19E128EFA00"/>so that, in either case, the Scribes and Pharisees would be gratified. What a crafty question, therefore, was this! Let us now see how very prudently our Saviour answered it.</P>
<P>At first, he appeared as if he took no notice of what was said to him (for when wicked men bring their ac∣cusations against others merely to indulge their own malice, it is often best not to lend an ear to them) but our Saviour, stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground. The Scribes and Pharisees now thought they had puzzled him, and they therefore pressed their question again with great earnestness. Ah! how little did they know of the true character of Christ, for he understood all their thoughts, through that divine pow∣er which belonged to him, and his silence, in fact, was only intended to draw these his enemies on into a diffi∣culty, and to make his own answer the more remark∣able. Our Saviour, after some time, raised himself from the ground, and said to them, <HI>he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</HI></P>
<P>What a heart-searching answer was this—and, at the same time, what an unexpected one! They that had just now been accusers, were hereby accused in their turn. It was as if our Saviour had said, "You have brought me a woman taken in adultery, and you seem to have been very eager in doing it, and you pretend that you merely want to know what ought to be done with her; I, however, see into your hearts, and because I know that your motives are corrupt, I shall not an∣swer you in the manner in which you expect; Moses as you observe, commanded the adulterer to be stoned: be it so; go then, if you please, and stone this woman; but take this hint with you, that it becomes those who are the most forward in blaming others to be particu∣larly free from blame themselves. Let him, therefore, take the lead in punishing her, who, by being free from fault himself, has the best right to inflict the punish∣ment:
<PB N="129" REF="035296_0223_1001C1A2675F0A60"/><HI>Let him that is without sin among you, cast the first stone at her.</HI> Having thus spoken, Christ return∣ed to his employment of writing on the ground, leav∣ing his reproof to work on the minds of the Scribes and Pharisees.</P>
<P>And now, behold the mighty force of a few words—<HI>they which heard it being convicted by their own consciences, went out one by one, beginning with the el∣dest, even unto the least; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</HI> What, are these god¦ly persons gone? all gone? And is the business on which they came left unfinished? It is even so. The criminal alone remains, and her accusers are fled; nor have they fled without reason, for they had now begun to perceive that there was one ready to accuse them in their turn, and that <HI>all things were naked and open be∣fore him with whom they had to do.</HI> Oh, if it had pleas∣ed our Saviour to bring to light all the hidden circum∣stances of their lives, and to publish on the spot every secret sin they had committed, how would they have had to blush before all the people! They thought it prudent, therefore, to make the best of their way out of the Temple, leaving our Saviour either to condemn or acquit the woman as he might think proper.</P>
<P>Reader, whensoever you seem tempted to be severe on any crime or failing of your neighbor, call to mind what passed between our Lord and these Pharisees; they were so busy in bringing to light the sin of another, that they had forgot that they had any sins of their own—they reflected not that they were some of the most unfit men in the world to take up the office of accusers, nor do they seem to have ever considered what was likely to become of themselves hereafter, when God should call them to judgment. And this is a common evil: God has given to every man his work; each has an evil heart of his own, which he ought to look to; each, if not guilty of open crimes, has many a secret
<PB N="130" REF="035296_0224_1001C1AA9535BFA0"/>sin that he ought to repent of: instead of which, every one is bestowing his attention on his neighbor's faults, without giving any heed to his own. We are all natu∣rally apt to entertain a very good opinion of ourselves, but a strict examination of our ways might chance to spoil that good opinion, and we are therefore very back∣ward in entering upon the task. On the contrary, we are very ready to blame our neighbor, for, in propor∣tion as we blacken his character, we cause our own to appear in a favorable light.</P>
<P>But how very foolish, as well as vain, is all this self-deceit! We may hide our sins, for a while, both from ourselves and from others also; just as the Pharisees concealed their true character, till our Saviour sent them this rebuke; <HI>soon, however, a day will come when all that has been kept secret shall be brought to light;</HI> and even now, let me remark, that the same divine per∣son, who, by a few words, confounded these hypocrites, has his eye upon us; <HI>for the Lord knoweth our down-sitting and our up-rising, and understandeth our thoughts long before; he is about our path, and about our bed, and espieth out all our ways. From him the darkness cannot hide us, for the darkness is no darkness to him, but the night is as clear as the day.</HI> Before him lies the history of our whole lives, in which is noted every thing that we have ever said, every thing that we have ever done, and every thing also that we have ever tho't or imagined in our minds. And now, if the same Je∣sus should again appear in the Temple, and reprove us as he did the Pharisees, awakening in like manner our consciences, and setting them to condemn us, who is there among us that could abide it? If he should pub∣lish among the croud of our fellow-creatures standing round us, all the secret sins of our lives, or should draw them up in the form of an accusation against us, and should require us to stand by and hear the long indict∣ment read, who is there, I say, who could stay to hear
<PB N="131" REF="035296_0225_1001C1B0E5D7B6B0"/>it to the end!—Who is there, who would not be glad to escape from his presence, and leave him again alone in the Temple!</P>
<P>Nor let us forget that, although Christ walketh not on earth as he once did, and though he is not present to reprove us with an audible voice, as he did the Pha∣risees, yet he still speaks to us by our consciences, and also by the still voice of his Holy Spirit, which striveth with us: and great is the power of conscience, when once awakened, and set to work by the power of God's Holy Spirit; for then nothing can withstand it; from the moment when it is truly alarmed it begins to disco∣ver a man to himself, and it will then find him so much employment at home, that he will have little leisure and less inclination to turn accuser of his brethren. Go now into the chamber of him whom sickness and sorrow have brought low, and have filled with a deep sense of sin; see with what readiness he confesses his iniquity, and with what earnestness he prays for pardon; see how en∣tirely he is taken up by the affairs of his own soul, and how he is laboring to make his peace with God. Tell him that some neighbor has fallen into a dreadful sin, and how, think you, will be be affected by it? Why, he will lament, pity, and pray for the person. But if you should try after the manner of some profane people to raise a joke at the expence of the unhappy sinner, hoping to divert the sick person with the subject, me∣thinks he would turn from you as from a man not fit for him to talk with, and he would probably beg you to go out of the room. To proceed one step farther. Sup∣pose the last day to be now come. Imagine that you see the Judge upon the Throne, the generations of mankind assembled before him, and the books opened, out of which we are all to be judged. Who, in that situation, would have any disposition to revile, or laugh at the sins of his neighbor, or would have any heart to be severe upon him? Who is there whose thoughts
<PB N="132" REF="035296_0226_1001C1B6271F8C78"/>would not be employed entirely upon his own case?—Who would not be anxious to obtain his own pardon; who, in short, would not leave God to deal as he tho't fit with others, hoping and praying that they also, if possible, might obtain mercy? To this temper, there∣fore, it is plain that sickness may soon bring us, and to this temper, may God grant that we may all be brought before it is too late, since death and judgment will most assuredly bring us to it at last.</P>
<P>Our Saviour having thus dispatched the Pharisees, the woman alone remains: she was detained in the Tem∣ple by the same cause which made the others depart—I mean consciousness of guilt. This kept her fixed to the spot even after her accusers were gone, expecting now to hear her sentence pronounced by Christ; who, at length, raised himself from the ground, on which he had been writing, says to the woman, <HI>where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, no man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not be led by this last speech of Christ, to sup∣pose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t he meant either to make light of the sin, or to say any thing against the law of God. No, let us take occasion rather in this place to remark how very dreadful a crime adultery is considered by our Creator, since he ordered it in the Old Testament to be punish∣ed even with death. This punishment, however, was not to be inflicted, except after regular proof; an accu∣ser and sufficient witnesses must come forward in every such case; the proper Judge or Magistrate must also hear the cause, and must himself pronounce the sentence. If all these necessary rules had been complied with, Christ would not have thought of stopping the due course of law, for he was not used to meddle with the civil power, nor is there any instance of his showing forth his mercy by saving a criminal out of the hands of public justice. In the present instance no kind of trial
<PB N="133" REF="035296_0227_1001C1BE10939760"/>had been had; on the contrary, the accusers and wit∣nesses were all fled; this woman, therefore, not being accused by those whose office it was to accuse her, was not accused by Christ neither, whose office it certainly was not. On another occasion, when Christ was ap∣pealed to by one who seems to have been wronged in his property, he made answer, <HI>man, who made me a judge and a divider.</HI> Our Saviour came into the world not to settle disputes about property, nor to meddle in cases of common criminal justice; he left all such things as these to be managed by the persons whom the state appointed for the purpose. He came to be a Saviour, he came to pardon sins committed against God, for which he made atonement by his death, and in his life time he taught men how to obtain this salvation, name∣ly, by repenting and believing in him, and resolving to <HI>sin no more.</HI></P>
<P>In full agreement with these ends of his coming into the world, he, in the present case, leaves the law of Moses just as it was, neither condemning nor yet ac∣quitting the woman; but as the publisher of the Gospel of the grace of God, and, as the author of everlasting Salvation, he comforts, with the hope of pardon, the wretched person whom the malicious Pharisees had bro't before him, and he directs her how to escape, not the more punishment of the law, but the more bitter pains of eternal death. <HI>Go,</HI> said he, <HI>and sin no more.</HI> It is as if he had said, "Be not concerned about the accusa∣tion before the magistrate, which has been brought a∣gainst you, for your accusers indeed are gone. I have put them to slight by a single sentence spoken to their consciences; and since the Pharisees do not accuse you, neither shall I turn prosecutor. Be concerned, howe∣ver, about the sin against God which you have commit∣ted, and if you would ever hope for mercy at his hands, be sure that you do not return to your iniquity. Go then in peace, Go in hope of pardon and salvation, for
<PB N="134" REF="035296_0228_1001C1BFB51BFE38"/>I am come in the world to be your Saviour, but <HI>go and sin no more.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE GRAND ASSIZES; OR, <HI>GENERAL GAOL DELIVERY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE was in a certain country a great king, who was also a judge. He was very merciful, but he was also very just; for he used to say that justice was the foundation of all goodness. His subjects were apt enough, in a general way, to extol his merciful temper, and especially those subjects who were always committing crimes which made them liable to be pu∣nished by his justice. This last quality they constantly kept out of sight, till they had cheated themselves into a notion that he was too good to punish at all.</P>
<P>Now it happened a long time before, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the king's favor, and had also fallen from a very prospe∣rous state in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts; but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay, the king's son most generously took the whole burthen of the debts on himself; and, in short, it was proposed that all their affairs should be settled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) provided only they would shew themselves to be sorry for what they had done themselves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I should however remark, that a book was also given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebellion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the king's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in time to come;
<PB N="136" REF="035296_0230_1001A3A1B44437F0"/>and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after having lived a certain number of years in a part of the same king's country, and under his eye and jurisdiction, there should be a Grand Assize, when every one was to be publicly tried for his past behavior, and after this trial was over, certain heavy punishments were to be inflicted on those who should have still persisted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be∣stowed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to notice, that this king's court differed in some respects from our courts of jus∣tice, being indeed a sort of court of appeal, to which questions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the common courts. And although with us all criminals are tried (and very pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my opin∣ion) by a jury of their peers, yet in this king's country the mode was very different; for, since every one of the people had been in a certain sense criminals, the king did not think it fair to make them judges also. It would, indeed, have been impossible to follow in all respects, the customs which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are charged in our courts are mere "overt acts," as the lawyers call them, that is, acts which re∣gard the outward behavior; such as the acts of striking, maiming, stealing, and so forth. But in the king's court it was not merely outward sins, but sins of the heart also which were to be punished. Many a crime, therefore, which was never heard of in the court of king's-bench, or at the Old Baily, was here to be bro't to light, and was reserved for this great day. Among these were pride, and oppression, and envy, and malice, and revenge, and covetousness, and secret vanity of mind, and evil thoughts of all sorts, and all evil wishes and desires. When covetousness, indeed, put men on committing robbery, or when malice drove them to an not of murder, then the common courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for these Great
<PB N="137" REF="035296_0231_1001C1CE5BE97648"/>Assizes; nevertheless since even a thief and murderer would now and then escape in the common courts, for want of evidence, or through some fault or other of the judge of jury, the escape was of little moment to the poor criminal, for he was sure to be tried again by this great king; and even though the man should have been punished in some sense before, yet he had now a farther punishment to fear, unless, indeed he was one of those, who had obtained (by the means I before spoke of) this great king's pardon. The sins of the heart, however, were by far the most numerous sort of sins, which were to come before this great tribunal; and these were to be judged by this great king in person, and by none but himself; because he possessed a certain power of getting at all secrets.</P>
<P>I once heard of a certain king of Sicily, who built a whispering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word that his rebellious subjects uttered, though spoken ever so low. But this secret of the king of Sicily was nothing to what this great king possessed; for he had the power of knowing every tho't which was conceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</P>
<P>Now you may be ready to think, perhaps, that these people were worse off than any others, because they were to be examined so closely, and judged so strictly. Far from it: the king was too just to expect bricks with∣out giving them straw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of direc∣tions, as I before observed; and because they were na∣turally short-sighted, he supplied them with a glass for reading it, and thus the most dim-sighted might see, if they did not wilfully shut their eyes; but though the king <HI>invited</HI> them to open their eyes, he did not <HI>compel</HI> them; and many remained stone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, because they would not use the glass, nor take the proper means for reading and
<PB N="138" REF="035296_0232_1001C1D0DA4D13F8"/>understanding all that was written for them. The humble and sincere learnt in time to see even that part of the book which was least plainly written; and it was observed that the ability to understand it depended more on the heart than the head; and evil disposition blinded the sight, while humility operated like an eye-salve.</P>
<P>Now it happened that those who had been so lucky as to escape the punishment of the lower courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good sort of people, and of course very safe from any danger at this Great Assize. This grand intended trial, in∣deed, had been talked of so much, and put off so long, (for it had seemed long at least to these short-sighted peo∣ple) that many persuaded themselves that it would never take place at all; and far the greater part were living away therefore without ever thinking about it; they went on just as if nothing at all had been done for their be∣nefit; and as if they had no king to please, no king's son to be thankful to, no book to guide themselves by, and as if the Assizes were never to come about.</P>
<P>But with this king <HI>a thousand years were as one day, for he was not slack concerning his promises, as some men count slackness.</HI> So at length the solemn period ap∣proached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the solemnity, or rather, they prepared for it much as some of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the Assize times; I mean by balls and feastings, and they saw their own trial come on with as little concern as is felt by the people in our streets, when they see the judge's procession enter the town, who indeed comfort themselves that it is only those in the prisons who are guilty.</P>
<P>But when at last the day came, and every man found that he was to be judged for himself, and that some how or other, all his secrets were brought out, and that there was now no escape, things began to take a more seri∣ous turn. Some of the worst of the criminals were
<PB N="139" REF="035296_0233_1001C1D780283CC8"/>got together debating in an outer court of the Grand Hall, and there they passed their time, not in compunc∣tion with tears, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comparing their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing themselves with such as had been still more notorious offenders.</P>
<P>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and oppres∣sion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, insulted a poor fellow as a thief, because he had stolen a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was," said a citizen to his apprentice, "for you drank and swore at the alehouse every Sunday night." "Yes," said the poor fellow, "but it was your fault that I did so, for you took no care of my soul, but spent all your Sabbaths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach me; I might have followed a good example, but I saw only bad ones. I sinned against less light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had spent all his wages on gin, took comfort that he had not sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a great estate in bribery at elections, as the lord o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manor had done, while a perjured elector boasted that he was no drunkard, like the journeyman.</P>
<P>I have not room to describe the awful pomp of the court, nor the terrible sounding of the trumpet which attended the judge's entrance, nor the sitting of the judge, nor the opening the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who stood before him. I shall pass over the multitudes who were tried and condemned to dun∣geons, and chains, and fire, and to perpetual banish∣ment from the presence of the king, which always seem∣ed to be the saddest part of the sentence. I shall only notice further, a few who brought some plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the king, and e∣ven deceived themselves so far as to think that his own book of laws would be their justification.</P>
<P>A thoughtless spendthrift advanced without any con∣trition,
<PB N="140" REF="035296_0234_1001C1DF150BB5E8"/>and said, "that he had lived handsomely, and had <HI>hated the covetous whom God abhorreth,</HI> and that he trusted in that passage of the book which said, that <HI>covetousness was idolatry;</HI> and that he therefore loped for a favorable sentence." Now it proved that this man had not only avoided covetousness, but that he had even left his wife and children in want through his excessive prodigality. The judge therefore immediately pointed to that place in the book where it is written, <HI>he that provideth not for his household is worse than an infidel. He that liveth in pleasure is dead while he liveth; thou,</HI> said he, <HI>in thy life time receivedest thy good things, and now thou must be tormented.</HI>—Then a miser, whom hunger and hoarding had worn to skin and bone, crept forward, and praised the sentence passed on this extra∣vagant youth, "and surely," said he, "since he is con∣demned, I am the man that may make some plea to fa∣vor—I was never idle or drunk, I kept my body in subjection. I have been so self-denying that I am cer∣tainly a saint: I have loved neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor children, to excess; in all this I have o∣beyed the book of the law." Then the judge said, "<HI>but where are thy works of mercy and thy labors of love?</HI> see that family which perished in thy sight last hard winter, while thy barns were overflowing; that poor family were my representatives, yet <HI>they were hun∣gry and thou gavest them no meat. Go to now thou rich man, weep and howl for the miseries that are come upon you. Your gold and your silves is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.</HI>" Then came up one with a most self-sufficient air. He walked up boldly, having in one hand the plan of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hospital which he had built, and in the other the drawing of a statue which was erecting for him in the country that he had just left, and on his forehead appeared in gold letters, the list of all the Public Charities to which he had subscribed.—
<PB N="141" REF="035296_0235_1001C1E4045B2C60"/>He seemed to take great pleasure in the condemnation of the Miser, and said, <HI>Lord, where saw I thee hun∣gry and fed thee not, or in prison and visited thee not? I have visited the fatherless and widow in their afflic∣tion.</HI> Here the Judge cut him short by saying, "True, thou didst visit the fatherless, but didst thou fulfil equal∣ly that other part of my command <HI>to keep thyself un∣spotted from the world.</HI>" No, thou wert conformed to the world in many of its sinful customs, <HI>thou didst follow a multitude to do evil; thou didst love the world and the things of the world;</HI> and the motive to all thy charities was not a regard to me but to thy own credit with thy fellow-men. Thou hast done every thing for the sake of reputation, and now thou art vainly trusting in thy works, instead of putting all thy trust in my Son, who has offered himself to be a surety for thee. Where has been that humility and gratitude to him which was required of thee. No, thou wouldst be thine own surety: thou hast trusted in thyself: thou hast made thy boast of thine own goodness: thou hast sought after and thou hast enjoyed the praise of men, and ve∣rily, I say unto thee, <HI>thou hast had thy reward.</HI></P>
<P>A poor diseased blind cripple, from the very Hospital which this great man had built, then fell prostrate on his face, crying out, <HI>Lord be merciful to me a sinner!</HI> on which the Judge, to the surprize of all, said, <HI>well done good and faithful servant.</HI> The poor man repli∣ed, "Lord, I have done nothing!" "But thou hast suf∣fered well," said the Judge; "thou hast been an example of patience and meekness and though thou hadst but few talents, yet thou hast well improved those few; thou hadst time, this thou didst spend in the humble duties of thy station, and also in earnest prayer, even for that proud Founder of thine Hospital, who never prayed for himself; thou wast indeed blind and lame, but it is no where said, my Son, give me thy feet or thine eyes, but <HI>give me thy heart;</HI> and even the faculties I did
<PB N="142" REF="035296_0236_1001C1E95D198238"/>grant thee, were employed to my glory; with thine ears thou didst listen to my word, with thy tongue thou didst shew forth my praise; <HI>enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI>" There were several who came forward, and boasted of some single and particular virtue, in which they had been supposed to excel. One talked of his generosity, another of his courage, and a third of his fortitude; but it proved, on a close examination, that some of those supposed virtues were merely the effect of a particular constitution of body; that others proceeded from a false motive, and that not a few of them were actual vices, since they were carried to excess; and un∣der the pretence of fulfilling one duty, some other duty was lost sight of; in short, these partial virtues were none of them done in obedience to the will of the king, but merely to please the person's own humour, and they would not therefore stand this day's trial, for <HI>he that had kept the whole law, and yet had wilfully and habitu∣ally offended in any one point, was declared guilty of breaking the whole.</HI></P>
<P>At this moment a sort of thick scales fell from the eyes of the multitude. They could now no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke comfort by measuring their neighbors' conduct against their own. Each at once saw himself in his true light, and found, alas! when it was too late, that he should have made the book which had been given him his rule of practice before, since it now proved to be the rule by which he was to be judged. Nay, every one now tho't himself even worse than his neighbor, because, while he only saw and heard of the guilt of others, he felt his own in all its aggravated hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</P>
<P>To complete their confusion, they were compelled to acknowledge the justice of the Judge who condemn∣ed them; and also to approve the favorable sentence by which thousands of other crimmals had not only their lives saved, but were made happy and glorious beyond all imagination, and all this was in consequence of their
<PB N="143" REF="035296_0237_1001C1EAF8C20780"/>sincere repentance, and their humble acceptance of the pardon offered to them by the King's Son. One thing was remarkable, that whilst most of those who were condemned, never expected condemnation, but even claimed a reward for their supposed innocence or good∣ness, all who were really rewarded and forgiven were sensible that they owed every thing to a mere act of grace, and they cried out with one voice, <HI>not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the praise!!!</HI></P>

<P>ONCE upon a time methought I set out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appeared to be a dark Valley, which was cal∣led the Valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many sorrowful adventures which poor passengers commonly meet with in their journey through it, but also because most of these tra∣vellers entered it weeping and crying, and left it in ve∣ry great pain and anguish.

<P>In their full view over the entrance of the Valley there were written in great letters, the following words:
<Q>Bear ye one another's Burthens.</Q></P>
<P>Now I saw in my vision that many of the travellers hurried on without stopping to read this instruction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third sort thought it very good advice for other people, but very seldom applied it to themselves. In short, I saw that too many of those people were of opinion that they had burthens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no occasion to take upon them those of others; so each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as pleasant as he could, without so much as once casting a thought on a pool over-loaded neighbor. Here, however, I have to make a rather singular remark, by which I shall plainly shew the folly of these selfish people. It was so ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one stretched out his hand to lighten a neighbor's burthen, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment also lightened his own. Besides, the obliga∣tion to help each other, and the benefit of doing so were mutual. If a man helped his neighbor, it commonly happened that some other neighbor came by-and-by and helped him in his turn; for there was no such thing as what we call <HI>independence</HI> in the whole valley. Not
<PB N="145" REF="035296_0239_1001C1F71131D330"/>one of all these travellers, however stout and strong, could move on comfortably without assistance, for so the Lord of the Valley, whose laws were all of them kind and good, had expressly ordained.</P>
<P>I stood still to watch the progress of these poor way∣faring people, who moved slowly on, like so many tick∣et porters, with burthens of various kinds on their backs; of which some were heavier, and some were lighter, but from a burthen of one kind or other, not one traveller was entirely free.</P>

<HEAD>THE WIDOW.</HEAD>
<P>A sorrowful widow, oppressed with the burthen of grief for the loss of an affectionate husband, would have been bowed down by her heavy load, had not the sur∣viving children with great alacrity stepped forward and supported her. Their kindness after a while, so much lightened the load which threatened at first to be intole∣rable, that she even went on her way with cheerful∣ness.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE HUSBAND.</HEAD>
<P>I next saw a poor old man tottering under a burthen so heavy, that I expected him every moment to sink un∣der it. I peeped into his pack and saw it was made up of many sad articles; there was poverty, oppression, sickness, debt, and what made by far the heaviest part, undutiful children. I was wondering how it was that he got on even so well as he did, till I spied his wife, a kind, meek, Christian woman, who was doing her ut∣most to assist him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her shoulder to the burthen, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a distance. She not only sustained him by her strength, but cheered him by her counsels. She told him that <HI>through much tribulation we must enter into rest,</HI> that <HI>he that overcometh shall inherit all things.</HI> In short,
<PB N="146" REF="035296_0240_1001C1FEBB845BD0"/>she so supported his fainting spirit, that he was enabled to <HI>run with patience the race that was set before him.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE KIND NEIGHBOR.</HEAD>
<P>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burthen, in which were packed sickness and want, with numberless other of those raw materials, out of which human misery is worked up. She was so weak that she could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind assistance of another woman almost as poor as herself; who, though she had no light burthen of her own, cheerfully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller who was still more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindness is soothing to the weary. And I remarked in many other cases, that it was not so much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burthens. Some had a coarse, rough, clumsy way of assisting a neighbor, which, though in fact it might be of real use, yet seemed, by galling the travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I observed in others that so cheap a kindness as a mild word, or even an affectionate look, made a poor burthened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that some human being cared for him, seemed to light∣en the load. But to return to this kind neighbor. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much use. When she saw the blind woman ready to faint, she would read her a few words out of this book, such as the following—<HI>blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.—Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI></P>

<P>A pious Minister, sinking under the weight of a dis∣tressed

The burthen of the parish thus divid∣ed became tolerable. The Minister, being no longer bowed down by the temporal distresses of his people, applied himself cheerfully to his own part of the weight. And it was pleasant to see how those two persons, nei∣ther of them very strong, or rich, or healthy, by thus kindly uniting together, were enabled to bear the weight of a whole parish; though singly, either of them must have sunk under the attempt. And I remember one great grief I felt during my whole journey was, that I did not see more of this union and concurring kindness, by which all the burthens might have been so easily di∣vided. It troubled me to observe, that of all the laws of the Valley, there was not one more frequently bro∣ken than <HI>the law of kindness.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE NEGROES.</HEAD>
<P>I now spied a swarm of poor black men, women, and children, a multitude which no man could number; these groaned and toiled, and sweated, and bled under far heavier loads than I had yet seen. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few white travellers were touched with the sorrowful sighing of those mil∣lions, and very heartily did they pat their hands to the burthens; but their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I perceived, however, that they never lost sight of those poor heavy-laden wretches, and as the number of these generous helpers encreased, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burthen, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</P>
<P>Among the travellers, I had occasion to remark, that those who most kicked and struggled under their bur∣thens, only made them so much the heavier; for their
<PB N="148" REF="035296_0242_1001C208D2724A40"/>shoulders became extremely galled by those vain strug∣gles. The load, if borne patiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers, (for so the Lord of the Valley had kindly decreed) but as to these grumblers, they had all the smart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all these burthens seem so very heavy was, that in every one without ex∣ception, there was a certain <HI>inner pacquet,</HI> which most of the travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their burthens, few said a word about this; though in truth it was the pressing weight of this <HI>secret pacquet</HI> which served to render the general burthen so intolerable. In spite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it; I found in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach that this pacquet had the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bel: the word SIN was written on all as a general title, and in ink so black that they could not wash it out. I observed that most of them took no small pains to hide the writing; but I was surprised to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e that they did not try to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rid of the load but the label. If any kind friend who assisted these people in bearing their burthens, did but so much as hint at the <HI>secret pacquet,</HI> or advise them to get rid of it, they took fire at once, and commonly denied they had any such article in their portmanteau; and it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s those whose <HI>secret pacquet</HI> swelled to the most en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣mous size, who most stoutly denied they had any.</P>
<P>I saw with pleasure, however, that some who had long labored heartily to get rid of this inward pacqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at length found it much diminished, and the more this pacquet shrunk in size, the lighter was the other part of their burthens also.</P>
<P>Then, methought, all at once, I heard a voice as it had been the voice of an angel, crying out and saying, "Ye unhappy Pilgrims, why are ye troubled about the burthen which ye are doomed to bear through this Val∣ley of Tears? Know ye not that as soon as ye shall
<PB N="149" REF="035296_0243_1001C20EA5D72240"/>have escaped out of this Valley, the whole burthen shall drop off, provided ye neglect not to remove that in∣ward weight of SIN which principally oppresses you? Study then the whole will of the Lord of this Valley. Learn from him how this heavy part of your burthens may now be lessened, and how at last it shall be remo∣ved forever. Be comforted. Faith and hope may cheer you even in this Valley. The passage, though it seems long to weary travellers, is comparatively short; for beyond it there is a land of everlasting rest, where ye shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, where ye shall be led by living fountains of waters, and all tears shall be wiped away from your eyes."</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="vision">
<HEAD>THE Strait Gate and the Broad Way, BEING THE SECOND PART OF THE VALLEY OF TEARS.</HEAD>
<P>NOW I had a second vision of what was passing in <HI>the Valley of Tears.</HI> Methought I saw again the same kind of travellers whom I had seen in the former part, and they were wandering at large through the same vast wilderness. At first setting out on his jour∣ney, each traveller had a lamp so fixed in his bosom,
<PB N="150" REF="035296_0244_1001C214FACD0250"/>that it seemed to make a part of himself, but as this <HI>na∣tural light</HI> did not prove to be sufficient to direct them in the right way, the king of the country, in pity to their wanderings and their blindness, out of his gracious condescension, promised to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e these poor way-faring people an additional supply of light from his own Royal Treasury. But as he did not cause to lavish his favors where there seemed no disposition to receive them, he would not bestow any of his oil on such as did not think it worth asking for. <HI>Ask and ye shall have,</HI> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from asking through pride, for they thought they had light enough already, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's treasury. Yet it was observed of those who rejected it, as think∣ing they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light shewed them. Others were deter∣red from asking, because they were told that it not only pointed out the dangers and difficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on themselves, and revealed to them ugly sights in their own hearts, to which they rather chose to be blind; for those travellers <HI>chose darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</HI> Now it was remarkable that these two properties were inseparable, and that the lamp would be of little outward use, except to those who used it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promise also never failed to accompany the offer of this light from the king, a promise that to those who improved what they had, <HI>more should be given, and a threat that from those who did not use it wisely, should be taken away even what they had.</HI></P>
<P>I observed that when the road was very dangerous, when terrors and difficulties and death beset the faithful traveller, then on their fervent importunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bountiful supplies of light, such as in common seasons never could have been ex∣pected;
<PB N="151" REF="035296_0245_1001C219E2025068"/>always proportioning the quantity given to the necessity of the case, <HI>as their day was, such was their light and strength.</HI></P>
<P>Though many chose to depend entirely on their own lamp, yet it was observed that this light was apt to go out if left to itself. It was easily blown out by those violent gusts which were perpetually howling through the wilderness, and indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwholesome atmosphere to extinguish it, just as you have seen a candle go out when exposed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a melan∣cholly sight to see multitudes of travellers heedlessly pacing on, boasting that they had light enough, and despising the offer of more. But what astonished me most of all was, to see many, and some of them too ac∣counted men of first rate wit, actually busy in blowing out their own light, because while any spark of it re∣mained, it only served to torment them, and point out things which they did not wish to see. And having once blown out their own light, they were not easy till they had blown out that of their neighbor's also; so that a good part of the wilderness seemed to exhibit a sort of universal <HI>blindman's buff,</HI> each endeavoring to catch his neighbor, while his own voluntary blindness exposed him to be caught himself, so that each was ac∣tually falling into the snare he was laying for another, till at length, as selfishness is the natural consequence of blindness, "catch he that catch can," became the gen∣eral cry throughout the wilderness.</P>
<P>Now I saw in my vision that there were some others who were busy in strewing the most gaudy flowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, and pit-falls with which the wilderness abounded, and thus making danger and death look so gay, that poor thoughtless creatures seem∣ed to delight in their own destruction. Those pit-falls did not appear deep or dangerous, because over them were raised gay edifices with alluring names, in which
<PB N="252" REF="035296_0246_1001C21DF7F370C8"/>were singing men and singing women, and dancing, and feasting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madness. But though the scenery was gay, the footing was unsound. The floors were full of holes through which the unthinking merry-makers were con∣tinually sinking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a song, many at the end of a feast, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was always poison at the bottom. But what most surprised me was, that though no day passed over their heads in which some of those merry-makers did not drop through, yet their loss made little impression on those who were left. Nay, instead of being awa∣kened to more circumspection and self-denial by the continual dropping off of those about them, several of them seemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contrary tendency, and the very shortness of the time was only urged as a reason to use it more sedulous∣ly for the indulgence in sensual delights. <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our∣selves with rose-buds before they are withered.</HI> With these and a thousand other such little mottos, the gay garlands of the wilderness were decorated. Some ad∣mired poets were set to work to put the most corrupt sentiments into the most harmonious tunes; these were sung without scruple, chiefly indeed by the looser sons of riot, but not seldom also by the more orderly daugh∣ters of sobriety, who were not ashamed to sing to the sound of instruments, sentiments so corrupt and immo∣ral, that they would have blushed to speak or read them; but the music seemed to sanctify the corruption, espe∣cially such as was connected with love or drinking.</P>
<P>Now I observed that all the travellers who had so much as a spark of light left, seemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to cast an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> which they were told lay at the end of their
<PB N="153" REF="035296_0247_1001C22542281FC0"/>journey; but as they could not see very far forward, and as they knew there was a <HI>dark and shadowy valley</HI> which must needs be crossed before they could attain to the <HI>happy land,</HI> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not sufficiently apt to consult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed cut the road to the hap∣py land so clearly, that <HI>the way-faring men, though simple, could not err.</HI> This map also defined very cor∣rectly the boundaries of the <HI>happy land</HI> from the <HI>land of misery,</HI> both of which lay on the other side of the <HI>dark and shadowy valley;</HI> but so many beacons and light-houses were erected, so many clear and explicit directions furnished for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one single traveller got wrong. But I am incli∣ned to think that in spite of the map, and the king's word, and his offers of assistance to get them thither, that the travellers in general did not heartily and truly believe after all, that there was any such country as the <HI>happy land;</HI> or at least, the paltry and transient plea∣sures of the wilderness so besotted them, the thoughts of the <HI>dark and shadowy valley</HI> so frightened them, that they thought they should be more comfortable by ban∣ishing all thought and forecast.</P>
<P>Now I also saw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wilderness, one of which every tra∣veller must needs take. The first was narrow and dif∣ficult, and rough, but it was infallibly safe. It did not admit the traveller to stray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being destitute of real com∣forts or sober pleasures. The other was a <HI>broad and tempting way,</HI> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and please the appe∣tite. To forget this dark valley, through which every traveller was well assured he must one day pass, seem∣ed indeed the object of general desire. To this grand
<PB N="154" REF="035296_0248_1001C22A88883440"/>end, all that human ingenuity could invent was indus∣triously set to work. The travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they sung, and they dan∣ced, and they drank as they went along, not so much because they all cared for these things, or had any real joy in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as because this restless activity served to divert their attention from ever being fixed on the <HI>dark and shadowy valley.</HI></P>
<P>The king, who knew the thoughtless temper of the travellers, and how apt they were to forget their jour∣ney's end, had thought of a thousand little kind atten∣tions to warn them of their dangers. And as we some∣times see in our gardens written on a board in great let∣ters, BEWARE OF SPRING GUNS—MAN TRAPS ARE SET HERE; so had this king caused to be written and stuck up before the eyes of the travellers, several like notices and cautions, such as <HI>broad is the way that leadeth to destruction—Take heed lest ye also perish—Woe to them that rise up early to drink wine—The plea∣sures of sin are but for a season,</HI> &amp;c. Such were the notices directed to the <HI>broad-way</HI> travellers, but they were so busily engaged in plucking the flowers, some∣times before they were blown, and in devouring the fruits, often before they were ripe, and in loading themselves with <HI>yellow-clay,</HI> under the weight of which millions perished, that they had no time so much as to look at the king's directions. Many went wrong be∣cause they preferred a merry journey to a safe one, and were terrified by certain notices, chiefly intended for the <HI>narrow-way</HI> travellers, such as, <HI>ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice;</HI> but had these fool∣ish people allowed themselves time or patience to read to the end, which they seldom would do, they would have seen these comfortable words added, <HI>but your sor∣row shall be turned into joy,</HI> also, <HI>your joy no man ta∣keth from you, and they that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="035296_0249_1001C23041C7A870"/>
Now I also saw in my dream, that many travellers who had a strong dread of ending at the <HI>land of misery,</HI> walked up to the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief when on looking more closely, they saw written on the inside, <HI>narrow is the way;</HI> this made them take fright, they compared the inscriptions with which the whole way was lined, such as, <HI>be ye not conformed to this world— deny yourselves—take up your cross,</HI> with all the tempt∣ing pleasures of the wilderness. Some indeed recollect∣ed the sine descriptions they had read of the <HI>happy land, the golden city, and the rivers of pleasures,</HI> and they sighed: but then, those joys were distant, and from the faintness of their light, they soon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the present good increased in bulk by its nearness, the distant good receded, diminished, disappeared! Their faith failed, they would trust no farther than they could see; they drew back and got into the <HI>broad-way,</HI> taking a com∣mon but sad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When these saint-hearted people, who yet had set out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became worse than those who had made no attempt to get in. <HI>For it is impossible,</HI> that is, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is next to impossible, <HI>for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repen∣tance.</HI></P>
<P>A few honest humble travellers not naturally stron∣ger than the rest, but strengthened by their trust in the king's word, came up by the light of their lamps, and meekly entered in at the <HI>Strait Gate;</HI> as they advan∣ced farther they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loss heavy, and though the way did not in reality grow wider, yet they grew reconci∣led to the narrowness of it, especially when they saw
<PB N="156" REF="035296_0250_1001C23441E22D80"/>the walls here and there studded with certain jewels cal∣led <HI>promises,</HI> such as <HI>he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</HI> And <HI>my grace is sufficient for you.</HI> Some when they were almost ready to faint, were encouraged by seeing that many niches in the <HI>narrow-way</HI> were filled with statues and pictures of Saints and Martyrs, who had borne their testimony at the stake, that the <HI>narrow-way</HI> was the safe way; and these travellers, instead of sinking at the sight of the painted wheel and gibbet, the sword and the furnace, were animated by these words written under them, <HI>those that wear white robes came out of great tribulation,</HI> and <HI>be ye followers of those, who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time there came a great multitude of travellers, all from <HI>Laodicea;</HI> this was the largest party I had yet seen; these were <HI>neither hot nor cold,</HI> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure present pain; so they contrived to deceive themselves by fancying that they resolved to keep the <HI>happy land</HI> in view, yet that there needs must be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally sure, with∣out being all equally rough; so they set on foot little contrivances to attain the end without using the means, and softened down the spirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own practice. Sometimes they would split a direction in two, and only use that half which suited them. For instance, when they met with the following rule, <HI>Trust in the Lord and be doing good,</HI> they would take the first half, and make themselves easy with a general sort of trust, that through the mercy of the king all would go will with them, though they themselves did nothing; and on the other hand, many made sure that a few good works of their own would do their business, and carry them safely to the <HI>happy land,</HI> though they did not trust in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus, some perished by a lazy
<PB N="157" REF="035296_0251_1001C23C96D48F08"/>faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <HI>Pharisees</HI> now appeared, who had so neglected their lamp that they did not see their way at all, though they fancied themselves to be full of light; they kept up ap∣pearances so well, as to delude others, and most effectu∣ally to delude themselves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at last. In this dreadful delu∣sion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never discovered the horrors which awaited them on the dismal shore. It was rema∣kable that while these Pharisees were often boasting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the praise of men, the humble travellers, whose steady light shew∣ed their good works to others, refused all commendation, and the brighter their light shined before men, so much the more they insisted that they ought to glorify not themselves, but <HI>their Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I now set myself to observe what was the particular let, molestation, and hindrance, which obstructed parti∣cular travellers in their endeavors to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who seem∣ed desirous of getting in, but he carried about him such a vast provision of bags full of gold, and had on so ma∣ny rich garments which stuffed him out so wide, that though he pushed and squeezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not possibly do so. Then I heard a voice crying, <HI>woe to him that loadeth himself with thick clay.</HI> The poor man felt something was wrong, and even went so far as to change some of his more cumbersome vanities into others which seemed loss bulky, but still he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the matter so easily, but began to throw away a little of the coarser part of his baggage, but still I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again, but it would not do; still his
<PB N="158" REF="035296_0252_1001C243E31E0D20"/>read these words, <HI>how hardly shall those who have riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> The poor man sighed to find it was impossible to enjoy his fill of both worlds, <HI>and went away sorrowing.</HI> If he ever afterwards cast a thought towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> it was only to regret that the road which led to it was too narrow to admit any but the meagre children of want, who were not so incumbered by wealth as to be too big for the passage. Had he read on he would have seen that <HI>with God all things are possible.</HI></P>
<P>Another advanced with much confidence of success, for having little worldly riches or hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, the gate did not seem so strait to him. He got to the threshold tri∣umphantly, and seemed to look back with disdain on all that he was quitting. He soon found, however, that he was so bloated with pride, and stuffed out with self-sufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a worse way than the rich man just named; for <HI>he</HI> was willing to throw away some of his outward luggage, whereas this man refused to part with a grain of that vanity and self-applause which made him too big for the way. The sense of his own worth so swelled him out, that he stuck fast in the <HI>gateway,</HI> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now that he must cut off all those big thoughts of himself if he wished to be reduced to such a size as to pass the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He scorned that humility and self-denial which might have shrunk him down to the proper dimensions; the more he insisted on his own qualifications for en∣trance, the more impossible it became, for the bigger he grew. Finding that he must become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the desire; and I now saw that though when he set his face towards the <HI>happy land</HI> he could not yet an inch forward, yet the instant he made a motion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turn back into the world, his speed became rapid enough, and he soon got back into the <HI>broaa-way.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="035296_0253_1001C249E74E5508"/>
Many, who fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a time were brought from their usual bulk by some affliction, seemed to get in with case.—They now thought all their difficulties over, for having been surfeited with the world, during their late disap∣pointment, they turned their backs upon it willingly e∣nough. A fit of sickness perhaps, which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into subjec∣tion, so that they were able just to get in at the <HI>gateway;</HI> but as soon as health and spirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em; they could not get on, but turned short, and got back into the world. I saw many attempt to enter who were stopt short by a large burthen of worldly cares; others by a load of idolatrous attachments; but I obser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that nothing proved a more complete bar than that vast bundle of prejudices with which multitudes were loaded. Others were fatally ob∣structed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of most descriptions, who had kept their light alive, by craving constant supplies from the king's treasury, got through at last by a strength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the largest bundle of bad habits I had seen, could not get on a step; he never ceased, however, to implore for light enough to see where his misery lay; he threw down one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpose; still he could not stir. At last striving as if in an agony, (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heaviest article in his pack; this was <HI>selfishness;</HI> the poor fellow felt relieved at once, his light burnt brightly, and the rest of his paok was as nothing.</P>
<P>Then I heard a great noise as of carpenters at work. I looked what this might be, and saw many sturdy tra∣vellers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to reduce themselves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this side, and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering,
<PB N="160" REF="035296_0254_1001C24ECE35BDB8"/>was to no purpose, they got only their labor for their pains; it was possible they might have reduced them∣selves, but they could not widen the way.</P>
<P>What grieved me most was to observe that many who had got on successfully a good way, now stopped to rest, and to admire their own progress. While they were thus valuing themselves on their attainments, their light diminished. While these were boasting how far they had left others behind, who had set out much ear∣lier, some slower travellers, whose beginning had not been so promising, but who had walked carefully, now outstripped them. These last walked, <HI>not as though they had already attained; but this one thing they did, forgetting the things which were behind, they pushed forward toward the mark for the prize of their high calling.</HI> These though naturally weak, yet, <HI>by laying aside every weight,</HI> finished the race that was set before them. Those who had kept their <HI>light burning,</HI> who <HI>were not wise in their own conceit,</HI> who <HI>laid their help on one that is mighty,</HI> who had <HI>chosen to suffer afflic∣tion rather than enjoy the pleasures of si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> came at length to the <HI>happy land.</HI> They had indeed <HI>the dark and sha∣dowy valley</HI> to cross; but even there they found a <HI>rod and a staff to comfort them.</HI> Their light, instead of be∣ing put out by the damps of the valley of the shadow or death, often burnt with added brightness. Some in∣deed suffered the terrors of a short eclipse; but even then their light, like that of a dark lanthorn, was not put out; it was only hid for a while, and even these often finish∣ed their course with joy. But be that as it might, the instant they reached the <HI>happy land,</HI> all tears were wi∣ped from their eyes, and the King himself came forth and welcomed them into his presence, and put a crown upon their heads, with these words, <HI>Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE COTTAGE COOK; OR, MRS. JONES's <HI>CHEAP DISHES;</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Way to do much Good with a little Money.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. JONES was a great merchant's lady. She was liberal to the poor, but as she was too much taken up with the world, she did not spare so much of her time and thoughts about doing good as she ought, so that her money was often ill bestowed. In the late troubles, Mr. Jones, who had lived in a grand manner, failed, and he took his misfortunes so much to heart that he fell sick and died. Mrs. Jones retired on a very nar∣row income to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> small village of Weston, where she seldom went out except to church. Though a pious woman she was too apt to indulge her sorrow; and tho' she did not neglect to read and pray, yet she gave up a great part of her time to melancholy thoughts, and grew quite inactive. She well knew how sinful it would be for her to seek a cure for her grief in worldly plea∣sures, which is a way many people take under afflictions, but she was not aware how wrong it was to weep away that time which might have been better spent in drying the tears of others.</P>
<P>It was happy for her that Mr. Simpson, the vicar of Weston, was a pious man. One Sunday he happened to preach upon the good Samaritan. It was a charity sermon, and there was a collection at the door. He called on Mrs. Jones after church, and found her in tears. She told him she had been much moved by his discourse, and she wept because she had so little to give
<PB N="162" REF="035296_0256_1001A3B607C72A48"/>to the plate; for though she felt very keenly for the poor in these dear times, yet she could not assist them. "Indeed fir," added she, "I never so much regretted the loss of my fortune, as this afternoon, when you bade us <HI>go and do likewise."</HI> "You do not," replied Mr. Simp∣son, "enter into the spirit of our Saviour's parable, if you think you cannot <HI>go and do likewise</HI> without being rich. In the case of the Samaritan you may observe, that charity was afforded more by kindness, and care, and medicine, than by money. You, Madam, were as much concerned in my sermon, as Sir John with his great estate; and, to speak plainly, I have been some∣times surpised that you should not put yourself in the way of being more useful."</P>
<P>"Sir," said Mrs. Jones, "I am grown shy of the poor since I have nothing to give them." "Nothing Ma∣dam," replied the clergyman, "do you call your time, your talents, your kind offices nothing? I will venture to say that you might do more good than the richest man in the parish could do by merely giving his money. In∣stead of sitting here, brooding over your misfortunes, which are past remedy, bestir yourself to find out ways of doing much good with little money; or even without any money at all. You have lately studied oeconomy for yourself. Instruct your poor neighbors in it. They want it almost as much as they want money. You have influence with the few rich persons in the parish. Exert that influence. Betty, my housekeeper, shall as∣sist you in any thing in which she can be useful. Try this for one year, and if you then tell me that you should have better shewn your love to God and man, and been a happier woman had you continued gloomy and inac∣tive, I shall be much surprised."</P>
<P>The sermon and this discourse made so deep an im∣pression on Mrs. Jones, that she formed a new plan of life, and set about it at once, as every body does who is in earnest. Her chief arm was the happiness of her poor
<PB N="163" REF="035296_0257_1001C25E68FFBA40"/>neighbors in the next world; but she was also very de∣sirous to promote their present comfort. The plans she pursued with a view to the latter object shall be explain∣ed in this little book. Mrs. Jones was much respect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by all the rich persons in Weston who had known her in her prosperity. Sir John was thoughtless, lavish, and indolent. The 'Squire was over-frugal, but active, sober, and not ill-natured. Sir John loved pleasure, the 'Squire loved money. Sir John was one of those popular sort of people who get much praise and yet do little good; who subscribe with equal readiness to a cricket match or a charity school; who take it for granted that the poor are to be indulged with bell-ringing and bonfires, and to be made drunk at Christmas; this Sir John called be∣ing kind to them; but he thought it was folly to teach them, and madness to think of reforming them.—He was, however, always ready to give his guinea; but I question whether he would have given up his hunting and his gaining to have cured every grievance in the land. On the other hand, the 'Squire would assist Mrs. Jones in any of her plans if it cost him nothing; so she shew∣ed her good sense by never asking Sir John for advice, or the 'Squire for subscriptions, and by this prudence gained the full support of both.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones resolved to spend two or three days in a week in getting acquainted with the state of the parish, and she took care never to walk out without a few little good books in her pocket to give away. She found that among the numerous wants she met with, no small share was owing to bad management or to indisposition. She was struck with the small size of the loaves. Wheat was now not very dear, and she was sure a good deal of blame rested with the baker. She sent for a shilling loaf to the next great town where the mayor often sent to the bakers' stops to see that the bread was prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r weight. She weighed her town loaf against her coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry loaf, and found the latter two pounds lighter than it
<PB N="164" REF="035296_0258_1001C26325FAEE50"/>ought to be. This was not the sort of grievance to carry to Sir John; but luckily the 'Squire was also a magistrate, and it was quite in his way. He told her he could remedy the evil if some one would lodge the in∣formation against the baker.</P>
<P>She dropt in on the blacksmith. He was at dinner. She enquired if his bread was good. "Aye, good enough mistress, for you see 'tis as white as your cap, if we had but more of it. Here's a sixpenny loaf, you might take it for a penny roll!" He then heartily cursed Crib the the baker and said he ought to be hanged. Mrs. Jones now told him what she had done, how she had detected the fraud, and assured him the evil should be redressed on the morrow, provided he would appear and inform. "I inform!" said he with a shocking oath, "hang an informer! I scorn the office." "You are nice in the wrong place, friend," replied Mrs. Jones, "for you do not scorn to abuse the baker, nor to be in a passion, nor to swear, though you scorn to redress a public injury, and to increase your children's bread. Let me tell you, there is nothing in which you ignorant people mistake more than in your notions about <HI>informers.</HI> Informing is the lawful way of obtaining redress, and though it is a mischievous and a hateful thing to go to a justice about every trifling matter, yet laying an information on im∣portant occasions, without malice or bitterness of any kind, is what no honest man ought to be ashamed of.—The shame is to commit the offence, not to inform a∣gainst it. I, for my part, should p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rhaps do right if I not only informed against Crib for making light bread, but against you for swearing at him." "Well but ma∣dam," said the smith, a little softened, "don't you think it a sin and a shame to turn informer?" "So far from it when a man's motives are good," said Mrs. Jones, "that in such clear cases as the present, I think it a du∣ty and a virtue. If it is right that there should be laws, it must be right that they should be put in exe∣cution;
<PB N="165" REF="035296_0259_1001C26863916090"/>but how can this be, if people will not inform the magistrates when they see the laws broken? An informer by trade is commonly a knave; a rash, mali∣cious, or pastionate informer is a fire-brand, but honest and prudent informers are almost as useful members of society as the judges of the land. If you continue in your present mind on this subject, do not you think that you will be answerable for the crimes you might have prevented by informing, and be a sort of accom∣plice of the villains who commit them?"</P>
<P>"Well madam," said the smith, "I now see plainly enough, that there is no shame in turning informer when my cause is good." "And your motive right, always mind that," said Mrs. Jones. Next day the smith attended, Crib was fined in the usual penalty, his light bread was taken from him, and given to the poor. The justices resolved henceforward to inspect the ba∣kers in their district; and all of them, except Crib, and such as Crib, were glad of it, for honesty never dreads a trial. Thus had Mrs. Jones the comfort of seeing how useful people may be without expence; for if she could have given the poor 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> she would not have done them so great or so lasting a benefit, and the true light in which she had put the business of <HI>informing,</HI> was of no small use.</P>
<P>There were two shops in the parish, but Mrs. Sparks at the Cross had not half so much custom as Wills at the Sugar Loaf, though she sold her goods a penny in a shilling cheaper, and all agreed that they were much better. Mrs. Jones asked Mrs. Sparks the reason.—"Madam," said the shop-keeper, "Mr. Wills will give longer trust. Besides this, his wife keeps shop on a Sunday morning while I am at Church." Mrs. Jones reminded Mr. Simpson to read the King's proclamation against vice and immorality next Sunday at Church, and prevailed on the 'Squire to fine any one who should keep open shop on a Sunday. She also put the people
<PB N="166" REF="035296_0260_1001C26C736FE090"/>in mind that a shop-keeper, who would sell on a Sun∣day, would be more likely to cheat them all the week, than one who went to Church.</P>
<P>She also labored hard to convince them how much they would lessen their distress if they would contrive to deal with Mrs. Sparks for ready money, rather than with Wills on long credit; those who listened to her, found their circumstances far more comfortable at the year's end, while the rest, tempted, like some of their betters, by the pleasure of putting off the evil day of payment, like them at last found themselves plunged in debt and distress. She took care to make a good use of such instances in her conversations with the poor, and by perseverance, she at length brought them so much to her way of thinking, that Wills found it to be his interest to alter his plan, and sell his goods on as good terms and as short credit as Mrs. Sparks sold hers.—This compleated Mrs. Jones's success, and she had the satisfaction of having put a stop to three or four great evils in the parish of Weston, without spending a shil∣ling in doing it.</P>
<P>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty Smart and Jenny Rose were thought to be the two best managers in the parish. They both told Mrs. Jones that the poor would get the coarse pieces of meat cheaper, if the gentlefolks did not buy them for soups and gravy. Mrs. Jones thought there was reason in this. So away she went to Sir John, the 'Squire, the Surgeon, the Attorney, and the Steward, the only per∣sons in the parish who could afford to buy costly things. She told them if they would all be so good as to buy only prime pieces, which they could very well afford, the coarse and cheap joints would come more within the reach of the poor. Most of the gentry readily consent∣ed. Sir John cared not what his meat cost him, but told Mrs. Jones in his gay way, that he would eat any∣thing, or give any thing, so that she would not teize him with long stories about the poor. The 'Squire
<PB N="167" REF="035296_0261_1001C2708D354190"/>said he should prefer vegetable soups because they were cheaper, and the Doctor because they were wholesomer. The Steward chose to imitate the 'Squire; and the At∣torney found it would be quite ungenteel to stand out. So gravy soups became very unfashionable in the parish of Weston; and I am sure if rich people did but think a little on this subject, they would be as unfashionable in many other places.</P>
<P>When wheat grew cheaper, Mrs. Jones was earnest with the poor women to bake large brown loaves at home, instead of buying small white ones at the shop. Mrs. Betty had told her that baking at home would be one step towards restoring the good old management. Only Betty Smart and Jenny Rose baked at home in the whole parish, and who lived so well as they did? Yet the general objection seemed reasonable. They could not bake without yeast, which often could not be had, as no one brewed but the great folks and the public houses. Mrs. Jones found, however, that Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and Jenny contrived to brew as well as to bake. She sent for these women, knowing that from them she could get truth and reason. "How comes it," said she to them, "that you two are the only poor women in the parish who can afford to brew a small cask of beer? Your hus∣bands have not better wages than other men." "True Madam," said Betty, "but they never set foot in a pub∣lic house. I will tell you the truth. When I first mar∣ried, our John went to the Checquers every night, and I had my tea and fresh butter twice a day at home.—This slop, which consumed a deal of sugar, began to <HI>rake</HI> my stomach sadly, as I had neither meat nor milk; at last (I am ashamed to own it) I began to take a drop of gin to quiet the pain, till in time I looked for my gin as regularly as for my tea. At last the gin, the ale∣house, and the tea, began to make us both sick and poor. I had like to have died with my first child.—Parson Simpson then talked so finely to us that we re∣solved,
<PB N="163" REF="035296_0262_1001C2746C75A720"/>by the grace of God, to turn over a new leaf, and I promised John if he would give up the Checquers I would break the gin-bottle, and never drink tea in the afternoon, except on Sundays when he was at home with me. We have kept our word, and both our eat∣ing and drinking, our health and our consciences are the better for it. Though meat is sadly dear, we can buy two pounds of fresh meat for less than one pound of fresh butter, and it gives five times the nourishment.—And dear as malt is, I contrive to keep a drop of drink in the house for John, and John will make me drink half a pint with him every evening, and a pint a day when I am a nurse."</P>
<P>As one good deed as well as one bad one brings on another, this conversation set Mrs. Jones on enquiring why so many ale-houses were allowed. She did not chuse to talk to Sir John on this subject, who would only have said, "let them enjoy themselves poor fel∣lows; if they get drunk now and then they work hard." But those who have this false good-nature, forget, that while the man is <HI>enjoying himself,</HI> as it is called, his wife and children are ragged and starving. True chris∣tian good-nature never indulges one at the cost of ma∣ny, but is kind to all. The 'Squire, who was a friend to order, took up the matter. He consulted Mr. Simp∣son. "The Lion," said he, "is necessary. It stands by the road side: travellers must have a resting place. As to the Checquers and the Bell they do no good but much harm." Mr. Simpson had before made many at∣tempts to get the Checquers put down; but unluckily, it was Sir John's own house, and kept by his late butler. Not that Sir John valued the rent, but he had a false kindness which made him support the cause of an old servant, though he knew he kept a disorderly house.—The 'Squire, however, now took away the licence from the Bell. And a fray happening soon after at the Checquers (which was near the Church) in time of di∣vine
<PB N="169" REF="035296_0263_1001C277C87AEDD0"/>service, Sir John was obliged to suffer the house to be put down as a nuisance. You would not believe how many poor families were able to brew a little cask when the temptations of those ale-houses were taken out of their way. Mrs. Jones, in her evening walks, had the pleasure to see many an honest man drinking his wholesome cup of beer by his own fire side, his rosy children playing about his knees, his clean, cheerful wife singing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r youngest baby to sleep, rocking the cradle with her foot, while with her hands she was ma∣king a dumpling for her kind husband's supper. Some few, I am sorry to say, though I don't chuse to name names, still preferred getting drunk once a week at the Lion, and drinking water at other times.</P>
<P>The good women being now supplied with yeast from each other's brewings, would have baked, but two difficulties still remained. Many of them had no ovens, for since the new bad management had crept in, many cottages have been built without this convenience. Fuel was also scarce at Weston. Mrs. Jones advised the building a large parish oven. To this oven, at a certain h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, three times a week, the elder children carried the loaves which their mothers had made at home, and paid a half-penny, or a penny, according to their size, for the baking.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones found that no poor woman in Weston could buy a little milk, as the farmers' wives did not care to rob their dairies.—This was a great distress, especially when the children were sick. So Mrs. Jones advised Mrs. Sparks at the Cross, to keep a couple of cows, and sell out the milk at half-penny worths. She did so, and found, that though this plan gave her some additional trouble, she got full as much by it as if she had made cheese and butter. She also sold rice at a cheap rate, so that with the help of the milk and the public oven, a fine rice pudding was to be had for a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="035296_0264_1001C27B8AF80778"/>
The girls' school in the parish was fallen into ne∣glect, for though many would be subscribers, yet no one would look after it. I wish this was the case at Weston only. It was not in Mr. Simpson's way to see if girls were taught to work. This is ladies' busi∣ness. Mrs. Jones consulted her counsellor, Mrs. Bet∣ty, and they went every Friday to the school, where they invited mothers as well as daughters to come, and learn to cut out to the best advantage. Mrs. Jones had not been bred to these things, but by means of Mrs. Cooper's excellent cutting out book, she soon became mistress of the whole art. She not only had the girls taught to make and mend, but to wash andiron too. She also allowed the mother or eldest daughter of every family to come once a week and learn how to dress <HI>one cheap dish.</HI> One Friday, which was cooking day, who should pass by but the 'Squire, with his gun and his dogs.— He looked into the school for the first time. "Well, madam," said he, "what good are you doing here?— What are you girls learning and earning? Where are your manufactures? Where is your spinning and your carding?" "Sir," said she, "this is a small parish, and you know ours is not a manufacturing country; so that when these girls are women, they will not be much employed in spinning. However, we teach them a lit∣tle of it, and more of knitting, that they may be able to get up a small piece of household linen once a year, and provide the family with stockings, by employing the odds and ends of their time in these ways. But there is a manufacture which I am carrying on, and I know of none within my own reach which is so valua∣ble." "What can that be," sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Squire. "To MAKE GOOD WIVES FOR WORKING MEN," said she, "Is not mine an excellent staple commodity? I am teaching these girls the art of industry and good man∣agement. It is little encouragement to an honest man to work hard all the week, if his wages are wasted by
<PB N="171" REF="035296_0265_1001C27DE5A3D570"/>a slattern at home," "What have you got on the fire madam?" said the Squire, "for your pot really smells as savoury, as if Sir John's French Cook had filled it." "Sir," replied Mrs. Jones, "I have lately got ac∣quainted with Mrs. White, who has given us an ac∣count of her cheap dishes, and wise cookery, in one of the cheap Repository little books. Mrs. Betty and I have made all her dishes, and very good they are, and we have got several others of our own. Every Friday we come here and dress one. These good women see how it is done, and learn to dress it at their own houses. I take home part for my own dinner, and what is left I give to each in turn. I hope I have opened their eyes on a sad mistake they had got into, <HI>that we think any thing is good enough for the poor."</HI></P>
<P>"Pray, Mrs. Betty," said the Squire, "oblige me with a bason of your soup." The Squire found it so good after his walk, that he was almost sorry he had promised to buy no more legs of beef, and declared a∣gain, that not one sheep's head should ever go to his kennel again. He begged his cook might have the re∣ceipt, and Mrs. Jones wrote it out for her. She has also been so obliging as to favor me with a copy of all her receipts. And as I hate all monopoly, and see no reason why such cheap, nourishing, and savoury dish∣es should be confined to the parish of Weston, I print them that all other parishes may have the same advan∣tage. Not only the poor, but all persons with small incomes may be glad of them. "Well, madam," said Mr. Simpson, who came in soon after, "which is best, to sit down and cry over our misfortunes, or to bestir ourselves to do our duty in the world?" "Sir," repli∣ed Mrs. Jones, "I thank you for the useful lesson you have given me. You have taught me that our time and talents are to be employed with zeal in God's ser∣vice, if we wish for his favour here or hereafter, and that one great employment of them, which he requires,
<PB N="172" REF="035296_0266_1001C28533C14868"/>is the promotion of the present, and much more, the future happiness of all around us. You have taught me that much good may be done with little money, and that the heart, the head, and the hands are of some use, as well as the purse."</P>

She did not much fear being able to raise the money, but money is of little use, unless some persons of sense and piety can be found to direct these institu∣tions. Not that I would discourage those who set them up even in the most ordinary manner, or from mere views of worldly policy. It is something gained to res∣cue children from idling away their sabbath in the fields or the streets. It is no small thing to keep them from those tricks to which a day of leisure tempts the idle and the ignorant. It is something for them to be taught to read; it is much to be taught to read the Bible, and much indeed to be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried regularly to church. But all this is not enough. To bring these institutions to an∣swer their highest end can only be effected by God's blessing on the following means, the choice of able teachers, and a diligent attention in some pious gentry to visit and inspect the schools.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ON RECOMMENDATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones had one talent that eminently qualified her to do good, namely, judgment; this even in the gay part of her life had kept her from many mistakes, but though she had sometimes been deceived herself, she was very careful not to deceive others, in recom∣mending people to fill any office either through selfish∣ness or false kindness. She used to say, "there is al∣ways some one appropriate quality which every person must possess, in order to fit them for any particular em∣ployment.
<PB N="175" REF="035296_0269_1001C294E4721400"/>Even in this quality," said she to Mr. Simpson, the clergyman, "I do not expect perfection; but if they are destitute of this, whatever good quali∣ties they may possess besides, though they may do for some other employment, they will not do for this. If I want a pair of shoes, I go to a shoemaker; I do not go to a man of another trade however ingenious he may be, to ask him if he cannot <HI>contrive</HI> to make me a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of shoes. When I lived in London, I learnt to be much on my guard as to recommendations. I found people often wanted to impose on me some one who was a burthen to themselves. Once I remember when I undertook to get a matron for an hospital, half my ac∣quaintance had some one to offer me. Mrs. Gibson sent me an old cook whom she herself had discharged for wasting her own provisions, yet she had the con∣science to recommend this woman to take care of the provisions of a large community. Mrs. Grey sent me a discarded housekeeper whose constitution had been ruined by sitting up with Mrs. Grey's gouty husband, but who she yet thought might do well enough to un∣dergo the fatigue of taking care of an hundred poor sick people. A third friend sent me a woman who had no merit but that of being very poor, and it would be charity to provide for her. The truth is, the lady was obliged to allow her a small pension till she could get her off her own hands by turning her on those of oth∣ers."</P>
<P>"It is very true madam," said Mr. Simpson, "the right way is always to prefer the good of the many to the good of one; if indeed it can be called doing good to any one to place them in a station in which they must feel unhappy, by not knowing how to discharge the duties of it. I will tell you how I manage. If the persons recommended are objects of charity, I private∣ly subscribe to their wants; I pity and help them, but I never promote them to a station for which they are
<PB N="176" REF="035296_0270_1001C29C19BA6148"/>unfit, and thus hurt a whole community to help a dis∣tressed individual."</P>
<P>Thus Mrs. Jones resolved, that the first step to∣wards setting up her school should be to provide a suit∣able mistress. The vestry were so earnest in recom∣mending one woman that she thought it worth looking into. On enquiry, she found it was a scheme to take a large family off the parish; they never considered that a very ignorant woman, with a family of young chil∣dren, was not fit for a school, all they considered was that the profits of the school might enable her to live without parish pay. Mrs. Jones refused another, tho' she could read well and was decent in her conduct, be∣cause she used to send her children to the shop on Sun∣days. And she objected to a third, a very sensible wo∣man, because she was suspected of making an outward profession of religion a cloak for immoral conduct.— Mrs. Jones knew she must not be too nice neither, she knew she must put up wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h many faults at last.— "I know," said she to Mr. Simpson, "the imperfec∣tion of every thing that is human. As the mistress will have much to bear with from the children, so I expect to have something to bear with in the mistress, and she and I must submit to our respective trials, by thinking how much God has to bear with in us all. But there are three things which a mistress must not be without, <HI>good-sense, activity,</HI> and <HI>piety.</HI> Without the first she will mislead others, without the second she will neglect them, and without the third, though she may civilize, yet she will never christianize them."</P>
<P>Mr. Simpson said, "he really knew but of one per∣son in the parish who was fully likely to answer her purpose: this," continued he "is no other than my house-keeper, Mrs. Betty Crew. It will indeed be a great loss to me to part from her; and to her it will be a far more fatiguing life than she at present leads. But ought I to put my own personal comfort, or ought
<PB N="177" REF="035296_0271_1001C2A148AC90D8"/>Betty to put her own ease and quiet in competition with the good of above an hundred children? This will appear still more important if we consider the good done, not as <HI>fruit</HI> but <HI>seed;</HI> if we take into the account how many yet unborn may become christians, in con∣sequence of our making these children christians. For how can we calculate the number which may be here∣after trained for heaven, by those very children we are going to teach, when they themselves shall become pa∣rents, and you and I are dead and forgotten? To be sure, by parting from Betty, my pease soup will not be quite so well flavored, nor my linen so neatly got up; but the day is fast approaching when all this will signi∣fy but little; but it will not signify a little whether one hundred immortal souls were the better from my ma∣king this petty sacrifice. Betty Crew is a real chris∣tian, has excellent sense, and had a good education from my mother. She has also had a little sort of train∣ing; for when the poor children come to the parson∣age for the broth on a Saturday evening, Betty is used to appoint them all to come at the same time, and after she has filled their pitchers, she ranges them round her in the garden, and examines them in their catechism. She is just and fair in dealing out the broth and beef, not making my favour to the parents depend on the skill of their children. But her own old caps, and rib∣bons, and cast off cloaths, are bestowed as little re∣wards on the best scholars. So that taking the time she spends in working for them, and the things she gives them, there is many a lady who does not exceed Betty in acts of charity; this I mention to confirm your notion, that it is not necessary to be rich in order to do good; a religious upper servant has great opportunities of this sort."</P>
<P>My readers, I trust, need not be informed, that this is that very Mrs. Betty Crew, who assisted Mrs. Jones in teaching poor women to cut out linen and cook
<PB N="178" REF="035296_0272_1001C2A769F374C8"/>cheap dishes, as related in the Cottage Cook. Mrs. Jones in the following week got together as many of the mothers as she could, and spoke to them as fol∣lows:</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. Jones's Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P>My good women, on Sunday next I propose to open a school for the instruction of your children.— Those among you who know what it is to be able to read your Bible will, I doubt not, rejoice that the same blessing is hold out to your children. You who are <HI>not</HI> able yourselves to read what your Saviour has done and suffered for you, ought to be doubly anxious that your children should reap a blessing which you have lost.— Would not that mother be thought an unnatural mon∣ster who should stand by and snatch out of her child's mouth the bread which a kind friend had just put into it? But such a mother would be merciful compared with her who should rob her children of the opportu∣nity of learning to read the word of God when it is held out to them. Remember, that if you slight the present offer, or if after having sent your children a few times you should afterwards keep them at home under vain pretences, you will have to answer for it at the day of judgment. Let not your poor children <HI>then</HI> have cause to say, "my fond mother was my worst en∣emy. I might have been bred up in the fear of the Lord, and she opposed it for the sake of a little paltry pleasure, for an idle holiday, I am now brought to the gates of hell." My dear women, which of you could bear to see your darling child condemned to everlasting destruction? which of you could bear to hear him ac∣cuse you as the cause of it? Is there any mother here present who will venture to say, 'I will doom the child I bore to sin and hell, rather than put them or myself to a little present pain by curtailing their evil inclina∣tions, I will let them spend the Sabbath in ignorance and idleness instead of sending them to school!' Let
<PB N="179" REF="035296_0273_1001C2ACA3FC6ED0"/>that mother who values her child's pleasure more than his soul now walk away, and I will set down the names of all those who wish to bring their young ones up in the way that leads to eternal life, instead of indulging them in the pleasures of sin which are but for a mo∣ment.</P>

<P>When Mrs. Jones had done speaking, most of the women thanked her for her good advice, and hoped that God would give them grace to follow it; promi∣sing to send their children constantly. Others, who were not so well disposed, were yet afraid to refuse, af∣ter the sin of so doing had been so plainly set before them. The worst of the women had kept away from this meeting, resolving to set their faces against the school. Most of them who were present, as soon as they got home set about providing their children with what little decent apparel they could raise. Many a willing mother lent her tall daughter her hat, best cap, and white handkerchief, and many a grateful father spared his linen waistcoat and better most hat to induce his grown up son to attend: for it was a rule with wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Mrs. Jones began, that she would not receive the younger children out of any family who did not send their elder ones. Too many made excuses that their sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were old, or their hat worn out. But Mrs. Jon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s told them not to bring any excuses to her which they could not bring to the day of judgment; and a∣mong those excuses she would hardly admit any except accidents, sickness, or attendance on sick parents, or young children.</P>

<HEAD>SUBSCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones was very desirous of getting the help and countenance of the farmers and trades-people, whose duty she thought it was to support a plan calcu∣lated to improve the virtue and happiness of the parish. Most of them subscribed, and promised to see that
<PB N="180" REF="035296_0274_1001C2B4EA5F9860"/>their workmen sent their children. She met with lit∣tle opposition till she called on farmer Hoskins. She told him as he was the richest farmer in the parish, she came to him for a handsome subscription. "Subscrip∣tion!" said he, "it is nothing but subscriptions I think; a man had need be made of money." "Farmer," said Mrs. Jones, "God has blessed you with abundant pros∣perity, and he expects you should be liberal in propor∣tion to your great ability." "I do not know what you mean by blessing," said he; "I have been up early and late, lived hard while I had little, and now when I thought I had got forward in the world, what with tythes and subscriptions it all goes I think." "Mr. Hoskins," said Mrs. Jones, "this is but an ungrateful return for all your blessings." "You are again at your blessings," said the Farmer, "but let every one work as hard as I have done and I dare say he will do as well. It is to my own industry I owe what I have. My crops have been good because I minded my ploughing and sowing." "Oh, farmer!" cried Mrs. Jones, "you forget whose suns and showers make your crops to grow; but I do not come here to preach but to beg." "Well, madam, what is it now? Flann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l or French? or weavers, or a new church, or large bread, or cheap rice? or what other new whim-wham for getting the money out of one's pocket?" "I am going to establish a Sunday school, farmer, and I come to you as one of the principal inhabitants, hoping your example will spur on the rest to give." "Why then," said the far∣mer, "as one of the principal inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, I will give nothing, hoping it will spur on the rest to refuse. Of all the foolish inventions, and new fangled devices to ruin the country, that of teaching the poor to read is the very worst." "And I, farmer, think that to teach good principles to the lower classes is the most likely way to save the country. Now in order to this we must teach them to read," "Not with my consent nor
<PB N="181" REF="035296_0275_1001C2BEB08687F8"/>my money," said the farmer, "for I know it always does more harm than good." "So it may," said Mrs. Jones, "if you only teach them to read and then turn them adrift to find out books for themselves. There is a proneness in the heart to evil which it is our duty to counteract, and which I see you are promoting. Only look round your own kitchen, I am ashamed to see it hung round with loose songs and ballads. I grant in∣deed, it would be better for your men and maids, and even your daughters, not to be able to read at all than to read such stuff as this. But if when they ask for bread you will give them a stone, nay worse, a serpent, yours is the blame." Then taking up a penny book which had a very loose title, she went on, "I do not wonder if you, who read such books as these, think it safer that people should not read at all." The farmer grinned, and said "it is hard if a man of my substance may not divert myself; when a bit of fun costs only a penny, and a man can spare that penny, there is no harm done. When it is very hot, or very wet, and I come in to rest and have drank my mug of cider, I like to take up a bit of a jest book or a comical story to make me laugh." "Oh, Mr. Hoskins," replied Mrs. Jones, "when you come in to rest from a burning sun or show∣er, do you never think of him whose sun it is that is ri∣pening your corn? or whose shower is filling the ear or causing the grass to grow? I could tell you of some books which would strengthen such thoughts, whereas such as you read only serve to put them out of your head." Mrs. Jones having taken pains to let Mr. Hos∣kins know, that all the genteel and wealthy people had subscribed, he at last said, "Why, as to the matter of that I do not value a crown; only I think it might be better bestowed, and I am afraid my own workmen will fly in my face if once they are made scholars, and that they will think themselves too good to work."—"Now "Now you talk soberly and give your reasons," said
<PB N="182" REF="035296_0276_1001A3C61D413E18"/>Mrs. Jones, "weak as they are, they deserve an an∣swer. Do you think that either man, woman, or child ever did his duty the worse, only because he knew it the better?" "No, perhaps not." "Now the whole ex∣tent of learning which we intend to give the poor, is only to enable them to read the Bible, a book in which every duty is explained, every doctrine brought into practice, and the brightest truths made level to the meanest understanding. The knowledge of that book and its practical influence on the heart is the best secu∣rity you can have both for the industry and obedience of your servants. Now can you think any man will be the worse servant for being a good christian?" "Per∣haps not." "Are not the duties of children, of serv∣ants, and the poor expressly set forth in the Bible?"—"Yes." "Do you think any duties are likely to be so well performed from any human motives, such as fear or prudence, as from these religious motives which are backed with the sanctions of rewards and punishments, of heaven or hell? Even upon your own principles of worldly policy, do you think a poor man is not less like∣ly to steal a sheep or a horse, who was taught when a boy, that it was a sin to rob a hen roost or an orchard? Will your property be secured so effectually by the stocks on the green, as by teaching the boys in the school, that <HI>for all these things God will bring them into judgment?</HI> Is a poor fellow who can read his Bible so likely to sleep or to drink away his few hours of leisure as one who <HI>cannot</HI> read? He may, and he often does make a bad use of his reading, but I doubt he would have been as bad without it. And the hours spent in learning to read will always have been among the most harmless ones of his life."</P>
<P>"Well madam," said the farmer, "if you do not think that religion will spoil my young servants, I do not care if you do put me down for half a guinea. What has farmer Dobson given?" "Half a guinea," said
<PB N="183" REF="035296_0277_1001C2C91F8EA0E8"/>Mrs. Jones. "Well," cried the farmer, "it shall ne∣ver be said I did not give more than he, who is only a renter. Dobson give half a guinea? Why he wears his coat as thread-bare as a laborer." "Perhaps," re∣plied Mrs. Jones, "that is one reason why he gives so much." "Well, put me down a guinea," cried the farmer. "As scarce as guineas are just now, I'll never be put upon the same footing with Dobson nei∣ther." "Yes, and you must exert yourself besides in insisting that your workmen send their children, and of∣ten look into the school yourself to see if they are there, and reward or discourage them accordingly," added Mrs. Jones, as she took her leave. The farmer insist∣ed in waiting on her to the door. When they got in∣to the yard, they spied Mr. Simpson, who was stand∣ing near a little group of females, consisting of the farmer's two young daughters, and a couple of rosy dairy maids, and old blind fidler, and a woman who led him. The woman had laid a basket on the ground, out of which she was dealing some songs to the girls, who were kneeling round it, and eagerly picking out such whose titles suited their tastes. On seeing the clergyman come up, the fiddler's companion (for I am sorry to say she was not his wife) pushed some of the songs to the bottom of the basket, turned round to the company, and in a whining tone, asked "if they would please to buy a godly book." Mr. Simpson saw thro' the hypocrisy at once, and instead of making any an∣swer, took out of one of the girl's hands, a song which the woman had not been able to snatch away. He was shocked and grieved to see that these young girls were about to read, to sing, and to learn by heart such rib∣aldry, as he was ashamed even to cast his eyes on. He turned about to the girl and gravely, but mildly said, "young woman, what do you think should be done to a person who should be found carrying a box of poison round the country, and leaving a little at every house?".
<PB N="184" REF="035296_0278_1001C2D1DF53A358"/>The girls all agreed that such a person ought to be hanged; "that the should," said the farmer, "if I was upon the jury." The fiddler and his woman were of the same opinion, declaring <HI>they</HI> would not do such a wicked thing for the world, for if they were poor they were honest. Mr. Simpson, turning to the other girl, said, "which is of most value, the soul or the body?" "The soul sir;" said the girl. "Why so?" said he, "because sir, I have heard you say in the pulpit, the soul is to last for ever." Then cried Mr. Simpson, in a stern voice, turning to the fiddler's woman, "are not you ashamed to sell poison for that part which is to last for ever? poison for the soul?" "Poison!" said the terrified girl, throwing down the book, and shudder∣ing as people do who are afraid they have touched something infectious. "Poison!" echoed the farmer's daughters, recollecting with horror the ratsbane which Lion, the old house dog had got at the day before, and after eating which, they had seen him drop down dead in convulsions. "Yes," said Mr. Simpson to the woman, "I do again repeat, the souls of these in∣nocent girls will be poisoned, and may be eternally ru∣ined by this vile trash which you carry about."</P>
<P>"I now see," said Mrs. Jones to the farmer, "the reason why you think learning to read does more harm than good. It is indeed far better that they should ne∣ver know how to tell a letter, unless you keep such trash as this out of their way, and provide them with what is good or what is harmless. Still this is not the fault of reading, but the abuse of it. Wine is still a good cordial, though it is too often abused to the pur∣pose of drunkenness.</P>
<P>The farmer said that neither of his maids could read their horn book, though he owned he often heard them singing that song which the parson had thought so bad, but for his part it made him as merry as a nightingale.</P>
<P>"Yes," said Mrs. Jones, "as a proof that it is not
<PB N="185" REF="035296_0279_1001A3C8065BCEC0"/>merely being able to read which does the mischief. I have often heard as I have been crossing a hay-field, young girls singing such indecent ribaldry as has driven me out of the field, though I well knew they could not read a line of what they were singing, but had caught it from others. So you see you may as well say the me∣mory is a wicked talent because some people misapply it, as to say that reading is dangerous, because some folks abuse it."</P>
<P>While they were talking, the fiddler and his woman were trying to steal away, but Mr. Simpson stopped them and said, "woman, I shall have some farther talk with you. I am a magistrate as well as a minister, and if I know it, I will no more allow a wicked book to be sold in my parish than a dose of poison." The girls threw away all their songs, thanked Mr. Simpson, beg∣ged Mrs. Jones would take them into her school after the had done milking in the evenings, that they might learn to read only what was proper. They promised they would never more deal with any but sober, honest hawkers, such as sell good little books, christmas car∣rols, and harmless songs, and desired the siddler's wo∣man never to call there again.</P>
<P>This little incident afterwards confirmed Mrs. Jones in a plan she had before some thoughts of putting in practice. This was, after her school had been es∣tablished a few months, to invite all the well-disposed grown-up youth of the parish to meet her at the school an hour or two on a Sunday evening, after the necessa∣ry business of the dairy and of serving the cattle was over. Both Mrs. Jones and her agent had the talent of making this time pass so agreeably by their manner of explaining scripture, and of impressing the heart by serious and affectionate discourse, that in a short time the evening school was nearly filled with a second com∣pany after the younger ones were dismissed. In time, not only the servants, but the sons and daughters of
<PB N="186" REF="035296_0280_1001C2DAAB9C90E8"/>the most substantial people in the parish attended. At length, many of the parents, pleased with the improve∣ment so visible in the young people, got a habit of drop∣ping in, that they might learn how to instruct their own families. And it was observed that as the school filled, not only the fives-court and public house were thinned, but even Sunday gossiping and tea visiting de∣clined. Even Farmer Hoskins, who was at first angry with his maids for learning of those <HI>merry</HI> songs as he called them, was so pleased by the manner in which the psalms were sung at the school, that he promised Mrs. Jones to make her a present of half a sheep to∣wards her first May-day feast. Of this feast some ac∣count shall be given hereafter, and the reader may ex∣pect some further account of the Sunday School next month in the History of Hester Wilmot.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="history">
<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HESTER WILMOT; OR, THE SECOND PART OF THE <HI>SUNDAY SCHOOL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HESTER WILMOT was born in the parish of Weston, of parents who maintained themselves
<PB N="187" REF="035296_0281_1001C2DF95C6F380"/>by their labor, they were both of them ungodly, it is no wonder therefore they were unhappy. They lived badly together, and how could they do otherwise, for their tempers were very different, and they had no re∣ligion to smooth down this difference, or to teach them that they ought to bear with each other's faults. Re∣becca Wilmot was a proof that people may have some right qualities, and yet be but bad characters. She was clean, notable, and industrious. Now I know some folks fancy that the poor who have these qualities, need have no other; but this is a sad mistake, as I am sure every page in the Bible would shew; and it is a pity people do not consult it oftener. Rebecca was of a vi∣olent ungovernable temper; and that very neatness which is in itself so pleasing, in her became a sin, for her affection to her husband and children was quite lost in an over anxious desire to have her house reckoned the nicest in the parish. Rebecca was also a proof that a poor woman may be as vain as a rich one, for it was not so much the comfort of neatness, as the praise of neatness which she coveted. A spot on her hearth, or a bit of rust on a brass candlestick would throw her in∣to a violent passion. Now it is very right to keep the hearth clean and the candlestick bright, but it is very wrong so to set one's affections on a hearth or a candle∣stick as to make oneself unhappy if any trifling accident happens to them; and if Rebecca had been as careful to keep her heart without spot or her life without blem∣ish, as she was to keep her fire-irons free from either, she would have been held up in this history, not as a warning, but a pattern, and in that case her nicety would have come in for a part of the praise. It was no fault in Rebecca but a merit, that her oak table was so bright you could almost see to put your cap on init; but it was no merit but a fault that when John, her hus∣band, laid down his cup of beer upon it so as to leave a mark, she would fly out into so terrible a passion that
<PB N="188" REF="035296_0282_1001C2E3C3ECD648"/>all the children were forced to run to corners; now poor John having no corner to run to, ran to the al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-house, till that which was at first a refuge, too soon be∣came a pleasure.</P>
<P>Rebecca never wished her children to learn to read because she said it would only serve to make them lazy, and she herself had done very well without it. She would keep poor Hester from church to stone the space under the chairs in fine patterns and whim-whams. I don't pretend to say there was any harm in this little decoration, it looks pretty enough, and it is better to let the children do that than do nothing. But still these are not things to set one's heart upon, and besides, Re∣becca only did it as a trap for praise; for she was sulky, and disappointed if any ladies happened to call in and did not seem delighted with the flowers which she used to draw with a burnt stick on the white wash of the chimney corners. Besides all this finery was often done on a Sunday, and there is a great deal of harm in do∣ing right things at a wrong time, or in wasting much time on things which are of no real use, or in doing any thing at all out of vanity. Now I beg that no lazy slat∣tern of a wife will go and take any comfort in her dirt from what is here said against Rebecca's nicety; for I believe that for one who makes her husband unhappy through neatness, twenty do so by dirt and laziness.—All excesses are wrong, but the excess of a good quali∣ty is not so common as the excess of a bad one.</P>
<P>John Wilmot was not an ill-natured man, but he had no fixed principle. Instead of setting himself to cure his wife's faults by mild reproof and a good exam∣ple, he was driven by them into still greater faults him∣self. It is a common case with people who have no religion, when any cross accident befals them, instead of trying to make the best of a bad matter, instead of considering their trouble as a trial sent from God to purify them, or instead of considering the faults of o∣thers
<PB N="189" REF="035296_0283_1001C2E8F3860870"/>as a punishment for their own sins, what do they do but either sink down at once into despair, or else run for comfort into evil courses. Drinking is the common remedy for sorrow, if that can be called a re∣medy, the end of which is to destroy soul and body.—John now began to spend all his leisure hours at the Bell. He used to be fond of his children, but when he found he could not come home in quiet and play with the little ones, while his wife dressed him a bit of hot supper, he grew in time not to come home at all. He who has once taken to drink can seldom be said to be guilty of one sin only; John's heart became hardened. His affection for his family was lost in self-indulgence. Patience and submission on the part of his wife might have won much upon a man of John's temper, but instead of trying to reclaim him, his wife seemed rather to de∣light in putting him as much in the wrong as she could, that she might be justified in her constant abuse of him. I doubt whether she would have been as much pleased with his reformation as she was with always talking of his faults, though I know it was the opinion of the neighbors, that if she had taken as much pains to reform her husband by reforming her own temper, as she did to abuse him and expose him, her endeavors might have been blessed with success. Good people, who are try∣ing to subdue their own faults, can hardly believe that the ungodly have a sort of savage satisfaction in trying, by the indulgence of their own evil tempers, to lessen the happiness of those with whom they have to do.—Need we look any farther for a proof of our own cor∣rupt nature, when we see mankind delight in sins which have neither the temptation of profit or pleasure, such as plaguing, vexing, or abusing each other.</P>
<P>Hester was the eldest of their five children, she was a sharp, sensible girl, but at fourteen years old she could not tell a letter, nor had she ever been taught to bow her knee to him who made her, for John's or rather
<PB N="190" REF="035296_0284_1001C2EE714FF278"/>Rebecca's house, had seldom the name of God pro∣nounced in it, except to be blasphemed.</P>
<P>It was just about this time, if I mistake not, that Mrs. Jones set up her Sunday school, of which Mrs. Betty Crew was appointed mistress, as was related last month. Mrs. Jones finding that none of the Wilmots were sent to school, took a walk to Rebecca's house, and civilly told her she called to let her know that a school was opened to which she desired her to send her children on the Sunday following, especially her eldest daughter Hester. "Well," said Rebecca, "and what will you give her if I do?" "Give her!" replied Mrs. Jones, "that is rather a rude question, and ask∣ed in a rude manner: however, as <HI>a soft answer turn∣eth away wrath,</HI> I assure you that I will give her the best of learning; I will teach her to <HI>fear God and keep his commandments."</HI> "I would rather you would teach her to fear me, and to keep my house clean," said this wicked woman. "She shan't come, however, unless you will pay her for it." "Pay her for it," said the la∣dy, "will it not be reward enough that she will be taught to read the word of God without any expence to you? For though many gifts both of books and cloathing will be given the children, yet you are not to consider these gifts so much in the light of payment as an expression of good will in your benefactors." "I say," interrupted Rebecca, "that Hester shan't go to school. Religion is of no use that I know of, but to make people hate their own flesh and blood; and I see no good in learning but to make folks proud, and lazy, and dirty. I cannot tell a letter myself, and, though I say it that should not say it, there is not a notabler wo∣man in the parish." "Pray," said Mrs. Jones mildly, "do you think that young people will disobey their pa∣rents the more for being taught to fear God?" "I don't think any thing about it," said Rebecca, "I shan't let her come, and there's the long and short of the mat∣ter.
<PB N="191" REF="035296_0285_1001C2F61F752D48"/>Hester has other fish to fry; but you may have some of these little ones if you will?" "No," said Mrs. Jones, "I will not; I have not set up a nursery but a school. I am not at all this expence to take cry∣ing babes out of the mother's way, but to instruct rea∣sonable b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings. And it ought to be a rule in all schools not to take the troublesome young children unless the mother will try to spare the elder ones, who are capa∣ble of learning." "But," said Rebecca, "I have a young child which Hester must nurse while I dress dinner. And the must iron the rags, and scour the irons, and dig the potatoes, and fetch the water to boil them." "As to nursing the child, that is indeed a necessary duty, and Hester ought to stay at home part of the day to enable you to go to church; and families should relieve each other in this way, but as to all the rest they are no rea∣sons at all, for the irons need not be scoured so often, and the rags should be ironed and the potatoes dug, and the water fetched on the Saturday, and I can tell you that neither your minister here, nor your judge hereaf∣ter, will accept of any such excuses."</P>
<P>All this while Hester staid behind, pale and trem∣bling, lest her unkind mother should carry her point—She looked up at Mrs. Jones with so much love and gratitude as to win her affection, and this good lady went on trying to soften this harsh mother. At last Re∣becca condescended to say, "well, I don't know but I may let her come now and then when I can spare her, provided I find you make it worth her while." All this time she had never asked Mrs. Jones to sit down, nor had once bid her young children be quiet, though they were crying and squalling the whole time. Rebecca fancied this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>deness was the only way she had of shew∣ing she thought herself as good as her guest, but Mrs. Jones never lost her temper. The moment she went out of the house, Rebecca called our loud enough for her to hear, and ordered Hester to get the stone and a
<PB N="192" REF="035296_0286_1001C2F8EF1DCC50"/>bit of sand to scrub out the prints of that dirty woman's shoes. Hester, in high spirits, cheerfully obeyed, and rubbed out the stains so neatly, that her mother could not help lamenting that so handy a girl was going to be spoiled by being taught godliness, and learning, and such nonsense.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, who knew the world, told her agent, Mrs. Crew, that her grand difficulty would arise not so much from the children as the parents. "These," said she, "are apt to fall into that sad mistake, that because their children are poor and have little of this world's goods, the mothers must make it up to them in false in∣dulgence. The children of the gentry are much more reproved and corrected for their faults, and bred up in far stricter discipline. He was a King who said, <HI>chas∣ten thy son, and let not thy rod spare for his crying.</HI>—But the more vicious the children are, you must re∣member the more they stand in need of your instruction. When they are bad, comfort yourself with thinking how much worse they would have been but for you; and what a burthen they would become to society if these evil tempers were to receive no check." The great thing which enabled Mrs. Crew to teach well, was, the deep insight she had got into the corruption of human nature. And I doubt if any one can make a thoroughly good teacher of religion and morals who wants this master-key to the heart. Others, indeed, may teach knowledge, decency, and good manners.—Mrs. Crew who knew that out of the heart proceed lying, theft, and all that train of evils which begin to break out even in young children, applied her la∣bors to correct this root of evil. But though a diligent, she was an humble teacher, well knowing that unless the grace of God blessed her labors, she should but la∣bor in vain.</P>
<P>Hester Wilmot never failed to attend the school, whenever her perverse mother would give her leave,
<PB N="193" REF="035296_0287_1001A3D7DC06A308"/>and her delight in learning was so great, that she would work early and late to gain a little time for her book. As she had a quick capacity, she learned soon to spell and read, and Mrs. Crew observing her diligence, used to lend her a book to carry home, that she might pick up a little at odd times. It would be well if teachers would make this distinction. To give or lend books to those who take no delight in them is an useless ex∣pense; while it is kind and right to assist well disposed young people with every help of this sort. Those who love books seldom hurt them, while the slothful who hate learning, will wear out a book more in a week than the diligent will do in a year. Hester's way was to read over one question in her catechism, or one verse in her hymn book, by fire-light before she went to bed; this she thought over in the night, and when she was dressing herself in the morning she was glad to find she always knew a little more than she had done the morn∣ing before. It is not to be believed how much those people will be found to have gained at the end of a year, who are accustomed to work up all the little odd ends and remnants of time; who are convinced that minutes are no more to be wasted than pence. Nay, he who finds he was wasted a shilling may by diligence hope to fetch it up again; but no repentance or indus∣try can ever bring back one wasted hour. My good young reader, if ever you are tempted to waste an hour, go and ask a dying man what he would give for that hour which you are throwing away, and according as he answers, so do you act.</P>
<P>As her mother hated the sight of a book, Hester was forced to learn out of sight: it was no disobedience to do this, as long as she wasted no part of that time which it was her duty to spend in useful labor. She would have thought it a sin to have left her work for her book; but she did not think it wrong to steal time from her sleep, and to be learning an hour before the rest of the
<PB N="194" REF="035296_0288_1001C131DF82D178"/>family were awake. Hester would not neglect the washing-tub, or the spinning-wheel, even to get on with her catechism; but she thought it fair to think over her questions, while she was washing and spin∣ning. In a few months she was able to read fluently in St. John's gospel, which is the easiest. But Mrs. Crew did not think it enough that her children could read a chapter, she would make them understand it al∣so. It is in a good degree owing to the want of reli∣gious knowledge in teachers that there is so little reli∣gion in the world. Unless the bible is laid open to the understanding, children may read from Genesis to the Revelation, without any other improvement than bare∣ly learning how to pronounce the words. Mrs. Crew found that there was but one way to compel their at∣tention: this was by obliging them to return back again to her the sense of what she had read to them, and this they might do in their own words, if they could not re∣member the words of scripture. Those who had weak capacities would, to be sure, do this but very imperfect∣ly; but even the weakest if they were willing would retain something. She so managed that saying the cat∣echism was not merely an act of the memory, but of the understanding; for she had observed formerly, that those who had learned the catechism in the common formal way, when they were children, had never understood it when they became men and women, and it remained in the memory without having made any impression on the mind. Thus this fine summary of the christian re∣ligion is considered as little more than a form of words, the being able to repeat which, is a qualification for being confirmed by the bishop, instead of being consi∣dered as really containing those grounds of christian faith and practice, by which they are to be confirmed christians.</P>
<P>Mrs. Crew used to say to Mrs. Jones, "those who teach the poor must indeed give line upon line, precept
<PB N="195" REF="035296_0289_1001C30947D5B4F0"/>upon precept, here a little and there a little, as they can receive it. So that teaching must be a great grievance to those who do not really make it a labor of love. I see so much levity, obstinacy, and ignorance, that it keeps my own forbearance in continual exercise, so that I crust I am getting good myself while I am doing good to others. No one, madam, can know till they try, that after they have asked a poor untaught child the same question nineteen times, they must not lose their temper, but go on and ask it the twentieth. Now and then, when I am tempted to be impatient, I correct myself, by thinking over that active proof which our blessed Saviour requires of our love to him when he says, <HI>feed my lambs.</HI></P>
<P>Hester Wilmot had never been bred to go to church, for her father and mother had never thought for going themselves, unless at a christening in their own family, or at a funeral of their neighbors, both of which they considered merely as opportunities for good eating and drinking, and not as offices of religion.</P>
<P>As poor Hester had no comfort at home, it was the less wonder she delighted in her school, her bible and church, for so great is God's goodness, that he is pleas∣ed to make religion a peculiar comfort to those who have no other comfort. The God whose name she had seldom heard but when it was <HI>taken in vain,</HI> was now revealed to her as a God of infinite power, jus∣tice, and holiness. What she read in her bible, and what she felt in her own heart, convinced her she was a sinner; and her catechism said the same. She was much distressed one day on thinking over this promise which she had just made (in answer to the question which fell to her lot) <HI>To renoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the devil and all his wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e flesh.</HI> I say she was dis∣tressed on finding that these were not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely certain words which she was bound to repeat; but certain con∣ditions
<PB N="196" REF="035296_0290_1001A3DF444A6768"/>which she was bound to perform. She was sad∣ly puzzled to know how this was to be done, till she met with these words in her bible. <HI>My grace is suffi∣cient for thee.</HI> But still she was at a loss to know how this grace was to be obtained. Happily Mr. Simpson preached on the next Sunday from this text, <HI>Ask and ye shall have,</HI> &amp;c. In this sermon was explained to her the nature, the duty, and the efficacy of prayer. After this she opened her heart to Mrs. Crew, who taught her the great doctrines of Scripture in a serious, but plain way. Hester's own heart led her to assent to that humbling doctrine of the catechism, that <HI>we are by na∣ture born in sin;</HI> and truly glad was she to be relieved by hearing or <HI>that spiritual grace by which we have a new birth unto righteousness.</HI> Thus her mind was no sooner humbled by one part, than it gained comfort from another. On the other hand, while she was re∣joicing in a <HI>lively hope of God's mercy through Christ,</HI> her mistress put her in mind that that was the only true repentance, <HI>by which we forsake sin.</HI> Thus the cate∣chism explained by a pious teacher was found to contain <HI>all the articles of the christian faith.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Jones greatly disapproved the practice of turn∣ing away the scholars, because they were grown up— "Young people," said she, "want to be warned at six∣teen more than they did at six, and they are commonly turned adrift at the very age when they want most in∣struction; when dangers and temptations most beset them. They are exposed to more evil by the leisure of a Sunday evening than by the business of the whole week: but then religion must be made pleasant, and instruction must be carried in a kind, and agreeable, and familiar way. If they once dislike the teacher they will soon get to dislike that is taught, so that a mas∣ter or mistress is in some measure answerable for the future piety of young persons, inasmuch as that piety depends on their manner of making religion pleasant as
<PB N="197" REF="035296_0291_1001C311F77F1B88"/>well as profitable." To attend Mrs. Jones's evening instructions was soon thought not a task but a holiday. In a few months it was reckoned a disadvantage to the character of any young person in the parish to know they did not attend the evening school. At first, indeed, many of them came only with a view to learn to sing psalms; but, by the blessing of God, they grew fond of instruction, and some of them became truly pious— Mrs. Jones spoke to them one Sunday evening as fol∣lows: "My dear young women, I rejoice at your im∣provement; but I rejoice with trembling. I have known young people set out well, who afterwards fell off. The heart is deceitful. Many like religious know∣ledge, who do not like the strictness of a religious life. I must therefore watch whether those who are diligent at church and school are diligent in their daily walk.— Whether those who say they believe in God, really o∣bey him. Whether they who profess to love Christ keep his commandments. Those who hear themselves commended for early piety, may learn to rest satisfied with the praise of man. People may get a knack at re∣ligious phrases without being religious; they may even get to frequent places of worship as an amusement, in order to meet their friends, and may learn to delight in a sort <HI>spiritual goss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p,</HI> while religion has no power in their hearts. But I hope better things of you, though I thus speak."</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HESTER WILMOT; OR, THE <HI>NEW GOWN.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>PART II.</HI> Being a Continuation by the Sunday School.</HEAD>
<P>HESTER Wilmot, I am sorry to observe, had been by natures peevish and lazy, she would now and then slight her work, and when her mother was very unreasonable she was too apt to return her a saucy answer, but when she became acquainted with her own heart, and with the Scriptures, these evil tempers were in a good measure subdued, for she now learnt to imitate, not her violent mother, but <HI>him who was meek and lowly.</HI> When she was scolded for doing ill, she prayed for grace do better; and the only answer she made to her mother's charge, "that religion only served to make people lazy," was to strive to do twice as much work, in order to prove that it really made them diligent.— The only thing in which she ventured to disobey her mother was, that when she ordered her to do week-days' work on a Sunday, Hester cried, and said, "she did not dare disobey God," but to show that she did not wish to save her own labor, she would do a double portion of work on the Saturday night, and rise two hours earlier on the Monday morning.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="035296_0293_1001C31D7009C290"/>
Once when she had worked very hard, her mother told her she would treat her with a holiday the following Sabbath, and take her a fine walk to eat cakes and drink ale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Weston fair, which, though it was professed to be kept on the Monday, yet, to the disgrace of the village, always began on the Sunday evening. Rebecca, who would on no account have wasted the Monday, which was a working day, in idleness and pleasure, thought she had a very good right to enjoy herself at the fair on the Sunday evening, as well as to take her children.— Hester earnestly begged to be left at home, and her mo∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in a rage, went without her. A w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t walk and more a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an she was used to drink gave Rebecca a danger∣ous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever; during this illness, Hester, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o would not follow her to a scene of dissolute mirth, attended her night and day, and denied herself necessaries that her sick mo∣ther might have comforts. And though she secretly prayed to God that this sickness might change her mo∣ther's heart, yet she never once reproached her, or put her in mind, that it was caught by indulging in a sin∣ful pleasure. Another Sunday night her father told Hes∣ter, he thought she had been at school long enough for him to have a little good of her learning, so he desired she would stay at home and read to him. Hester cheer∣fully ran and fetched her Testament, but John fell a laughing, called her a fool, and said, "it would be time enough to read the Testament to him when he was go∣ing to die, but at present he must have something mer∣ry." So saying, he gave her a song-book which he had picked up at the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. Hester having cast her eyes over it, refused to read it, saying, "she did not dare offend God by reading what would hurt her own soul." John called her a canting hypocrite, and said, he would put the Testament in the sire, for that there was not a more merry girl than the was before she became religious.— Her mother, for once, took her part, not because she thought by her daughter in the right, but because she was
<PB N="200" REF="035296_0294_1001C16BD40411B8"/>glad of any pretence to shew her husband was in the wrong; though she herself would have abused Hester for the same thing if John had taken her part. John, with a shocking oath, abused them both, and went off in a violent passion. Hester, instead of saying one undu∣tiful word against her father, took up a psalter in order to teach her little sisters, but Rebecca was so provoked at her for not joining her in her abuse of her husband, that she changed her humor, said John was in the right, and Hester a perverse hypocrite, who only made reli∣gion a pretence for being undutiful to her parents.—Hester bore all in silence, and committed her cause to 02 him who judgeth righteously. It would have been a great comfort to her if she had dared to go and open her heart to Mrs. Crew, and to have joined in the reli∣gious exercises of the evening at school. But her mo∣ther refused to let her, saying, it would only harden her heart in mischief. Hester said not a word, but after having put the little ones to bed, and heard them say their prayers out of sight, she went and sat down in her own little lost, and said to herself, "it would be pleasant to me to have taught my little sisters to read, I thought it was my duty, for David has said, <HI>Come yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> It would have been still more pleasant to have passed the evening at school, because I am still ig∣norant, and fitter to learn than to teach; but I cannot do either without flying in the face of my mother; God fees fit to-night to change my pleasant duties into a pain∣ful trial. I give up my will, and I submit to the will of my father; but when he orders me to commit a known sin then I dare not do it, because, in so doing, I must disobly my Father which is in heaven." Now it so fell out that this dispute happened on the very Sun∣day next before Mrs. Jones's yearly feast. On May∣day all the school attended her to church, each in a stuff gow of their own earning, and a cap and white apron
<PB N="201" REF="035296_0295_1001C16F59949580"/>of her giving. After church there was an examination made into the learning and behaviour of the schools; those who were most perfect in their chapters, and brought the best character for industry, humility, and sobriety, received a bible, or some other good book.</P>
<P>Now Hester had been a whole year hoarding up her little savings in order to be ready with a new gown on the May-day feast. She had never got less than two shillings a week by her spinning, besides working for the family, and earning a trifle by odd jobs. This mo∣ney she faithfully carried to her mother every Saturday night, keeping back, by consent, only two pence a week towards the gown. The sum was compleat, the pattern had long been settled, and Hester had only on the Monday morning to go to the shop, pay her money, and bring home her gown to be made. Her mother happened to go out that morning early to iron-in a gentleman's family, where she usually stayed a day or two, and Hester was busy putting the house in order before she went to the shop.</P>
<P>On that very Monday there was to be a meeting at the Bell of all the idle fellows in the parish. John Wil∣mot of course was to be there. Indeed he had accepted a challenge of the blacksmith to a batch at all-fours.—The blacksmith was flush of money, John thought himself the best player; and that he might make sure of winning, he resolved to keep himself sober, which he knew was more than the other would do. John was so used to go upon tick for ale, that he got to the door of the Bell before he recollected that he could not keep his word with the gambler without money, and he had not a penny in his pocket, so he sullenly turned home∣wards. He dared not apply to his wife, as he knew he should be more likely to get a scratched sace than a six∣pence from her; but he knew that Hester had receiv∣ed two shillings for her last week's spinning on Satur∣day, and perhaps she might not yet have given it to her
<PB N="202" REF="035296_0296_1001C177304E8420"/>mother. Of the hoarded sum he knew nothing. He asked her if she could lend him half a crown and he would pay her next day. Hester pleased to see him in good humor after what had passed the night before, ran up and fetched down her little box, and, in the joy of her heart that he now desired something she could com∣ply with without wounding her conscience, cheerfully poured out her whole little stock upon the table. John was in raptures at the sight of three half-crowns and a six-pence, eagerly seized it, box and all, together with a sew hoarded halfpence at the bottom, though he had only asked to borrow half a crown. None but one whose heart was hardened by a long course of drunkenness could have taken away the whole, and for such a purpose. He told her she should certainly have it again next morning, and indeed intended to pay it, not doubting but he should double the sum. But John over-rated his own skill or luck, for he lost every farthing to the blacksmith, and sneaked home before midnight, and quietly walked up to-bed. He was quite sober, which Hester thought a good sign. Next morning she asked him in a very humble way for the money, which she said she would not have done, but that if the gown was not bought directly, it would not be ready in time for the feast. John's conscience had troubled him a little for what he had done, for when he was not drunk he was not ill-natured, and he stammered out a broken ex∣cuse, but owned he had lost the money, and had not a farthing left. The moment Hester saw him mild and kind, her heart was sostened, and she begged him not to vex; adding that she would be contented never to have a new gown as long as she lived, if she could have the comfort of always seeing him come home as sober as he was last night. For Hester did not know that he had refrained from getting drunk, only that he might gamble with a better chance of success, and that when a gamester keeps himself sober, it is not that he may
<PB N="203" REF="035296_0297_1001C17CF58BFA30"/>practise a virtue, but that he may commit a worse crime. "I am indeed sorry for what I have done," said he, "you cannot go to the feast, and what will Madam Jones say?" "Yes, but I can," said Hester, "for God looks not at the gown, but at the heart, and I am sure he sees mine full of gratitude at hearing you talk so kindly; and if I thought my dear father would change his present evil courses, I should be the happi∣est girl at the feast to-morrow." John walked away mournfully, and said to himself, "surely there must be something in religion since it can thus change the heart. Hester was a pert girl, and now she is as mild as a lamb. She was an indolent girl, and now she is up with the lark. She was a vain girl, and would do any thing for a new ribbon; and now she is contented to go in rags to a feast at which every one else will have a new gown. She deprived herself of the gown to give me the mo∣ney, and yet this very girl, so dutiful in some things, would submit to be turned out of doors, rather than read a loose book at my command, or break the Sab∣bath. I do not understand this, there must be some mystery in it." All this he said as he was going to work. In the evening he did not go to the Bell, whe∣ther it was owing to his new thoughts or to his not having a penny in his pocket, I will not take upon me positively to say, but I believe it was a little of one, and a little of the other.</P>
<P>As the pattern of the intended gown had long been settled in the family, and as Hester had the money by her, it was looked on as good as bought, so that she was trusted to get it brought home and made in her mother's absence. Indeed, so little did Rebecca care about the school, that she would not have cared any thing about the gown, if her vanity had not made her wish that her daughter should be the best drest of any girl at the feast. Being from home as was said before, she knew nothing of the disappointment. On May∣day
<PB N="204" REF="035296_0298_1001C18D0EB3EA80"/>morning, Hester, instead of keeping from the feast because she had not a new gown, or meanly inventing any excuse, dressed herself out as neatly as she could in her poor old things, and went to join the school in or∣der to go to church. Whether Hester had formerly in∣dulged a little pride of heart, and talked of this gown rather too much, I am not quite sure, certain it is, there was a great hue and cry made at seeing Hester Wilmot, the neatest girl, the most industrious girl in the school, come to the May-day feast in an old stuff gown, when every other girl was so creditably dress. Indeed, I am sorry to say, there were two or three much too smart for their station, and who had dizened themselves out in very improper finery, which Mrs. Jones made them take eff before her. "I mean this feast," said she, "as a re∣ward of industry and piety, and not as a trial of skill who can be finest, and outvie the rest in show. If I do not take care my feast will become an encouragement, not to virtue, but to vanity. I am so great a friend to decency of apparel, that I even like to see you deny your appetites that you may be able to come decently dresser to the house of God. To encourage you to do this, I like to set apart this one day of innocent pleasure against which you may be preparing all the year, by laying a∣side something every week towards buying a gown out of your little savings. But let me tell you, that meek∣ness and an humble spirit is of more value in the sight of God and good men than the gayest cotton gown, or the brightest pink ribbon in the parish."</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, for all this, was as much surprised as the rest at Hester's mean garb: but such is the power of a good character that she gave her credit for a right in∣tention, especially as she knew the unhappy state of her family. For it was Mrs. Jones's way (and it is not a bad way) always to wait, and enquire into the truth, before she condemned any body of good character, tho' appearances were against them. "As we cannot judge
<PB N="205" REF="035296_0299_1001C19059303E00"/>of people's motives," said she, "we may, from igno∣rance, condemn their best actions, and approve of their worst." It will be always time enough to judge unfa∣vorably, and let us give others credit as long as we can and then we in our turn may expect a favorable judg∣ment from others." Hester was no more proud of what she had done for her father, than she was humbled by the meanness of her garb, and though Betty Stiles, one of the girls, whose finery had been taken away, sneered at her, Hester never offered to clear herself by exposing her father, though she thought it right secretly to inform Mrs. Jones of what had past. When the examination of the girls began, Betty Stiles was asked some ques∣tions on the fourth and fifth commandments, which she answered very well. Hester was asked nearly the same questions, and though she answered them no better than Betty had done, they were all surprised to see Mrs. Jones rise up and give a handsome bible to Hester, while she gave nothing to Betty. This girl cried out rather pertly, "Madam, it is very hard that I have no book, I was as perfect as Hester." "I have often told you," said Mrs. Jones, "that religion is not a thing of the tongue b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the heart. That girl gives me the best proof that she has learned the fourth commandment to good purpose, who persists in keeping holy the sabbath day, though commanded to break it by a parent whom she loves. And that girl best proves that she keeps the fifth, who gives up her own comfort and cloathing, and credit, to honor and obey her father and mother, even though they are not such as she could wish. Bet∣ty Stiles, though she could answer the questions so rea∣dily, went a nutting last Sunday when she should have been at school, and refused to nurse her sick mother when she could not help herself."</P>
<P>Farmer Hoskins, who stood by, whispered to Mrs. Jones, "Well, Madam, now you have convinced even one of the benefit of religious instruction, now I sce
<PB N="206" REF="035296_0300_1001C195F1D35730"/>there is a meaning to it. I thought it was in at one ear and out at the other, and that a song was as well as a psalm; but now I have found that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I sce your scholars must <HI>do</HI> what they <HI>bear,</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> what they <HI>learn.</HI> Why at this rate, they will all be the better servants for being real∣ly godly, and so I will add a pudding to next year's feast."</P>
<P>The pleasure Hester felt in receiving a new bible, made her forget that she had on an old gown. She walked to church in a thankful frame; but how great was her joy, when she saw, among a number of work∣ing men, her own father going into church. As she past by him she cast on him a look of so much joy and affection, that it brought tears into his eyes, especially when he compared her mean dress with that of the o∣ther girls, and thought who had been the cause of it.—John, who had not been at church for some years, was deeply struck with the service. The confession with which it opens went to his heart. He felt, for the first time, that he was <HI>a miserable sinner, and that there was no health in him.</HI> He now felt compunction for sin in general, though it was only his ill beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to his daughter which had brought him to church. The ser∣mon was such as served to strengthen the impression which the prayers had made, and when it was over, instead of joining the ringers (for the belfry was the only part of the church John liked, because it usually led to the ale-house) he quietly walked back to his work. It was indeed the best day's work he ever made. He could not get out of his head the whole day the first words he had heard at church. <HI>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness, and doth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</HI> At night, instead of going to the Bell, he went home, in∣tending to ask Hester to forgive him; but as soon as he got to the door, he heard Rebecca rating his daugh∣ter
<PB N="207" REF="035296_0301_1001C19AC63B4A88"/>for having brought such a disgrace on the family as to be seen in that old rag of a gown, and insisted on knowing what she had done with the money. Hester tried to keep the secret, but her mother declared she w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld turn her out of doors if she did not tell the truth. Hester was at last forced to confess she had given it to her father. Unfortunately for poor John, it was at this very moment he opened the door. The mother now di∣vided her fury between her guilty husband and her in∣nocent child, till from words she fell to blows. John defended his daughter, and received some of the strokes intended for the poor girl. This turbulent scene part∣ly put John's good resolutions to flight, though the pa∣tience of Hester did him almost as much good as the sermon he had heard. At length the poor girl escaped up stairs, not a litte bruised, and a scene of much vio∣lence passed between John and Rebecca. She declared she would not sit down to supper with such a brute, and set off to a neighbor's house, that she might have the pleasure of abuting him the longer. John, whose mind was much disturbed, went up stairs without his supper. As he was passing by Hester's little room he heard her voice, and as he concluded she was venting bitter complaints against her unnatural parents, he stop∣ped to listen, resolving to go in and comfort her. He stopped at the door, for by the light of the moon he saw her kneeling by her bedside, and praying so earnestly that she did not hear him. As he made sure she could be praying for nothing but his death, what was his sur∣prise to hear these words, "O Lord, have mercy upon my dear father and mother, teach me to love them, to pray for them, and do them good, make me more du∣tiful, and more patient, that, adorning the doctrine of God, my Saviour, I may recommend his holy religion, and my dear parents may be brought to love and fear thee."</P>
<P>Poor John, who would never have been hard hearted
<PB N="208" REF="035296_0302_1001C1A025A3C5D0"/>if he had not been a drunkard, could not stand this, he fell down on his knees, embraced his child, and beg∣ged her to teach him how to pray. He prayed himself as well as he could, and though he did not know what words to use, yet his heart was melted; he owned he was a sinner, and begged Hester to fetch the prayer-book, and read over the confession with which he had been so much struck at church. This was the pleasant∣est order she had ever obeyed. Seeing him deeply af∣fected with a sense of sin, she pointed out to him the Saviour of sinners; and in this manner she past some hours with her father, which were the happiest of her life; such a night was worth a hundred cotton, or even silk gowns. In the course of the week Hester read o∣ver the confession, and some other prayers to her fa∣ther so often that he got them by heart, and repeated them while he was at work. And at length he took courage to kneel down and pray before he went to-bed From that time he bore his wife's ill-humor much bet∣ter than he had ever done, and, as he knew her to be neat and notable, and saving, he began to think, that if her temper was not quite so bad, his home might st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l become as pleasant a place to him as ever the Bell had been; but unless she became more tractable h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did not know what to do with his long evenings after the little ones were in bed, for he began once more to delight in playing with them. Hester proposed that she should teach him to read an hour every night, and he consent∣ed. Rebecca began to storm from the mere trick she had got of storming; but finding that he now brought home all his earnings, and that she got both his mo∣ney and his company (for she had once loved him) she began to reconcile herself to this new way of life. In a few months John could read a psalm; in learning to read it he also got it by heart, and this proved a little store for private devotion, and while he was mowing be could call to mind a text to cheer his labor. Henow
<PB N="209" REF="035296_0303_1001C1A5948B5E70"/>went constantly to church, and often dropped in at the school on a Sunday evening to hear their prayers. He expressed so much pleasure at this, that one day Hester ventured to ask him if they should set up family prayer at home. John said he should like it mightily, but as he could not yet read quite well enough, he desired Hes∣ter to try to get a proper book, and begin next Sunday night. Hester had bought of a pious hawker for three half-pence the book of prayers, printed for the cheap Repository, by Mr. Marshall, Queer-street, Cheap-side.</P>
<P>When Hester read the exhortation at the beginning of this little book, her mother who sat in the corner; and pretended to be asleep, was so much struck that she could not find a word to say against it. For a few nights indeed, she continued to sit still, or pretended to rock the young child while her husband and daughter were kneeling at their prayers. She expected John would have scolded her for this, and so perverse was her tem∣per, that she was disappointed at his finding no fault with her. Seeing at last that he was very patient, and that though he prayed fervently himself, he suffered her to do as she liked, she loft the spirit of opposition for want of something to provoke it. As her pride be∣gan to be subdued, some little disposition to piety was awakened in her heart. By degrees she slid down on her knees, though at first it was behind the cradle or the clock, or in some corner where she thought they would not see her. Hester rejoiced even in this out∣ward change in her mother, and prayed that God would at last be pleased to touch her heart as he had done that of her father.</P>
<P>As John now spent no idle money, he had saved up a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trifle by working over-hours, this he kindly offered to Hester to make up for the loss of her gown. Instead of accepting it, Hester told him, that as she herself was young and healthy, she should soon be able to clothe
<PB N="210" REF="035296_0304_1001C1AD51F25088"/>herself out of her own savings, and begged him to make her mother a present of this gown, which he did. It had been a maxim of Rebecca, that it was better not to go to church at all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> go in an old gown. She had, however, so far conquered this evil notion, that she had lately gone pretty often. This kindness of the gown touched her not a little, and the first Sunday she put it on, Mr. Simpson happened to preach from this text, <HI>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</HI> This sermon so affected Rebecca that she ne∣ver once thought she had her new gown on, till she came to take it off when she went to-bed, and that ve∣ry night, instead of skulking behind, she knelt down by her husband.</P>
<P>There was one thing sunk deep in Rebecca's mind, she had observed that since her husband had grown re∣ligious he had been so careful not to give her any of∣fence, that he was become scrupulously clean; took off his dirty shoes before he sat down, and was very cautious not to spill a drop of beer on her shining table. Now it was rather remarkable, that as John grew more neat, Rebecca grew more indifferent to neatness. But both these changes arose from the same cause, the growth of religion in their hearts. John grew cleanly from the fear of giving pain to his wife, while Rebecca grew indifferent from having discovered the sin and va∣nity of an over anxious care about trist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>Hester continues to grow in grace and in knowledge. Last christmas-day she was appointed an under teacher in the school, and many people think that some years hence, if any thing should happen to Mrs. Crew, Hes∣ter may be promoted to be head mistress.</P>

<PB REF="035296_0305_1001C1B3261E6470"/>
<HEAD>ON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD's SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P>HOW comes it that so many persons who go re∣gularly to public worship, nevertheless do not attend at the Sacrament? Are they right or wrong in turning their backs on this solemn ordinance? It is a question well worth considering, and it is the intention of this tract to clear up, in some measure, this impor∣tant subject.</P>
<P>I believe the principal reason which many people have to give for not receiving the Sacrament is, that they are afraid of it. "I think it an awful thing," say they, "to receive the Sacrament. I am fearful lest I should eat and drink my own damnation." To such persons we reply, have you ever enquired into the real meaning and nature of what you so much dread? Read the present tract. Learn to under stand what the acra∣ment of the Lord's Supper is, and when you know, then decide whether you will receive it or not. Let me here remark also, that the phrase of <HI>eating and drinking our own damnation</HI> is a phrase extremely misunderstood. It is borrowed from the Apostle Paul, but when the Apostle used it he applied it to certain Corinthians who got drunk at the Sacrament; and it is material also to observe, that by the word "damnation" the Apostle meant "condemnation," and you will find, if you will read the passage that he alluded chiefly to certain judg∣ments in this world which the Corinthians brought upon them, so that even in their case he did not mean
<PB N="212" REF="035296_0306_1001C1B8B9773A38"/>to declare, that there would be no room for repentance in this world, and no salvation in the next. It must be owned in like manner, or rather it ought to be solemn∣ly insisted on, that every one who now communicates unworthily, encreases his guilt rather than promotes his salvation; but still be does not sin past all possibility of forgiveness; and let it be remembered, that a man may sin not only by communicating unworthily, but also by refusing to communicate.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the manner in which Christ appointed the Sacra∣ment of the Lord's Supper.</HEAD>
<P>The best means of knowing what is the true nature of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is to enquire into all that passed when our Saviour appointed it.—We read, with little difference of terms, in several of the Evangelists, that our Saviour, <HI>on the same night on which he was betrayed, being at supper with his dis∣ciple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, took bread and gave thanks, and brake it and gave unto them, saying, this is my body which is giv∣en for you. This do in remembrance of me. Likewise also, the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you.</HI> The A∣postle Paul further observes, <HI>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till be come.</HI> From this short and simple account, which is nearly all that Scripture says on the subject, we are to collect what was our Saviour's intention in ap∣pointing this Sacrament.</P>
<P>Now I think we are to understand, that he thereby meant to command all christians to meet together, from time to time, and to partake of bread and wine, in or∣der to keep up among them the remembrance of this his last supper with his disciples, and of the sufferings and death of Christ, which immediately followed. <HI>Take eat,</HI> said he, after having broken the bread, <HI>this is my body.</HI> That is, this broken bread is to remind you of my
<PB N="213" REF="035296_0307_1001C1BBE231C4D8"/>body broken for your sake. And speaking of the cup, he said, <HI>Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remis∣sion of sins.</HI> That is, this cup is to remind you of my blood being shed for the pardon (or remission) of sins. <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI> These last mentioned words may be understood both as an entreaty and as a command. Christ, your Saviour, entreats you thus to remember him. Christ, also, who is your Judge and Lord, commands you to do it. The command is as plain as any other command of Scripture, and he who disobeys one command of Christ, may, with much the same reason, disobey every other. It is, in short, as if our blessed Saviour had said, "I am now about to die for your sins, and to rise again for your justification, and I make it my last and dying request that you, and all my disciples will accustom yourselves to meet toge∣ther, and to partake of bread and wine, as we have now done, in token of your bearing in mind, my pain∣ful and bloody death, and in token also of your believ∣ing that I, who am now about to be crucified, shall hereafter come again, according to my promise, in pow∣er and great glory." <HI>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What it is to receive the Sacrament unworthily.</HEAD>
<P>First then, I think it is plain that to receive it igno∣rantly, is to receive it unworthily. This may very pro∣perly be called <HI>not discerning the Lord's body.</HI> Gross ignorance or error concerning the nature of the Sacra∣ment, evidently shews a man to be unfit at present to receive it, and gross ignorance of the doctrines of christianity is in like manner a disqualification. This ignorance, however, is that which should immediately be cured. Every person who is come to years of discre∣tion should be afraid of remaining a stranger to the
<PB N="214" REF="035296_0308_1001A3A02CB5FBE0"/>Lord's table. He should lose no time in enquiring into the nature of it, and when he understands it, he is no more to be excused for absenting himself from it, than he is for absenting himself from the common public worship.</P>
<P>But next I would observe, that to receive the Sacra∣ment in any respect, lightly and carelessly, is to receive it unworthily. Some receive the Sacrament as a thing of course as soon as ever they arrive at a certain age; and at this same age perhaps they go and plunge them∣selves into all the vanities and follies of the world, if not into its vices also. Some receive it because they have a grave character to support; some because they are expected to receive it, and are ashamed to refuse to do so, having, for instance, a brother or a sister who receives it from whom they do not care to differ; some from mere zeal for their own church, of which they shew themselves steady members by receiving the Sa∣crament according to the forms which it has appoint∣ed: some from a confused mixture of several of the a∣bovementioned motives; and some for the mere pur∣pose of qualifying themselves for a place under govern∣ment. Thus, while many seriously disposed persons need to be encouraged to come to the Lord's table much more than is their custom, it is to be feared also, that there are not a few of our communicants who in one way or other receive the Sacrament very unworthily.</P>
<P>Again, to receive the Lord's Supper superstitiously is to receive it in some measure unworthily. Now a man receive it superstitiously who thinks there is some charm or unaccountable virtue in it, and who is not content with believing the Sacrament to be a means of grace, in the same manner as prayer or the reading of the Scriptures, or attendance on public worship. The papists go so far as to adore the elements of bread and wine, which they also fancy that the priest is able, by consecration, to turn into the real and literal body and
<PB N="215" REF="035296_0309_1001C1C514419BA0"/>blood of Christ; and there are some Protestants who have not entirely escaped from the same error; for they fancy that there is some dark and mystical meaning in the Sacrament, which, however, they cannot explain; and they are not aware that it is that plain and simple thing which we have described it to be. I am sorry to add that some superstitious protestants imitate the pa∣pists in another respect. They think they have done a very meritorious deed when they have received the Sa∣crament; they have gone through what they call their religious duty, and in consideration of this they fancy that they have now obtained a right to employ them∣selves in any manner they think sit, and away therefore they go from the Lord's table into the world with minds full of ambition or pride, or covetousness, and the very Sacrament which they have attended serves to confirm them in the neglect of daily and habitual repentance, and to give a dangerous and false peace to their consciences, There are persons of this description who prepare them∣selves possibly with much solemnity for the day of re∣ceiving the Sacrament, and who even attend the ser∣vice with a face of great sanctity and seriousness. It must, nevertheless, be laid down as a maxim, that whenever any one's life is quite at variance with every thing he professes at the Lord's table, that person must be considered as a mere hypocrite and self-deceiver, and as one of the worst and most unworthy sort of commu∣nicants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the self-examination that is proper before we deter∣mine to receive the Sacrament.</HEAD>
<P>St. Paul, after reproving the Corinthians for their profanation of the Lord's Supper, observes, <HI>but let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</HI> In the catechism of the church of England we are instructed, what it is that may now be particularly required of communicants; namely,
<PB N="216" REF="035296_0310_1001C1CA5FA82810"/>"that they should examine themselves whether they re∣pent them truly of their former sins, stedfastly purpos∣ing to lead a new life; whether they have a lively faith in God's mere, through Christ, with a thankful re∣membrance of his death, and whether they are in chari∣ty with all men!" Let every one then examine him∣self on these sever I heads, and more especially when he is for the first time about to communicate. Here, how∣ever, while we warn the careless not to be too slight in their self-examination, let us also caution the serious not to be too severe. It is not required that a man should have become free from sin, nor that he should even have reached to some great heights in religion, before he ven∣tures to the Sacrament; for the Sacrament itself sup∣poses us sinful creatures, and is intended to cheer us with the hope of pardon, through that death of Christ, which it sets before us Reader! if your heart is full of pride, or covetousness, or impenitence, and unbe∣lief, or if you are carried away by the love of the world, and are cold and indifferent about religion, or if you are habitually given to any deceit or fraud, or to any secret wickedness, approach not to the holy table; but if the sins I have spoken of are the very things which you hate, and if the mercie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God in Christ, are the sincere desire of your soul, then doubt non that the Sa∣crament of the Lord's Supper is intended for such per∣sons as you, however weak your faith, and however small your present attainments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the dispositions which we should feel at the time of communicating.</HEAD>
<P>The Lord's Supper was ordained "for a continual remembrance of the sacrifice and death of Christ, and of the benefits which we receive thereby." The bene∣fits which we receive from the death of Christ, are therefore one of the chief subjects on which we should reflect when we are approaching the table of the Lord
<PB N="217" REF="035296_0311_1001C1CC19A68B28"/>We should consider that we are now about to comme∣morate the death of that Savior who died for us, <HI>the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God: who was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, and the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep had gone astray; but the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</HI> Let it never be forgotten when we go to the table of the Lord that we should go thi∣ther in the very character of sinners. In this respect there is no difference, <HI>for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace, thro' the redemption that is in Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, that he might be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.</HI> Christ is that <HI>Lamb of God,</HI> a Lamb <HI>without blemish and without spot,</HI> which has been offered up as a bleeding sacrifice, and <HI>which taketh away the sins of the world. Take, eat, this is my body, which is gi∣ven for you,</HI> and <HI>this is my blood which is shed for you for the remission of sins.</HI> Unto him, therefore, we are to look, and through the exercise of this faith in Christ, and not <HI>through our own works or deservings,</HI> we are to hope for pardon. <HI>There is, therefore now no condem∣nation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Therefore, being jus∣tified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Such are some of the thoughts con∣cerning our Savior's death, as well as the blessed effects of it, which the Scriptures teach us to indulge, and which are more peculiarly proper at the time of receiv∣ing the Sacrament.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the character and conduct which becomes us after having received the Sacrament.</HEAD>
<P>Presuming the reader to be a member of the church of England, we will here more particularly remind him
<PB N="218" REF="035296_0312_1001A3A5F95C5380"/>of a few passages in the Sacramental service provided by our Church. In that service we are supposed to say, "We do not presume to come to this thy table, O mer∣ciful Lord! trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies." Now have we been sin∣cere in uttering these words? Let us beware then how we afterwards talk of the innocence of our lives and the goodness of our hearts, and how we boast of our character and our honor as worldly people do; let us take care that we never put any part of our confidence in that righteousness which we have professed in those words to renounce. Humility, meekness, patience to∣wards others, loving kindness and charity, a disposition to forgive injuries and to take reproofs without anger, contentment with our lot, and submission under the af∣flicting hand of Providence, all these are tempers which cannot fail to arise out of an habitual sense of our un∣worthiness, and they are the tempers therefore which become a communicant; nor is there any doubt that every sincere communicant will find these tempers en∣crease in him through his frequent attendance at the Lord's table.</P>
<P>Again, we are supposed by another part of the ser∣vice most humbly to declare, "We do most earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings. The remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the bur∣thens of them is intolerable." But how false and hypo∣critical should we suspect ourselves to have been in these words, if we seldom afterwards feel any sorrow for our sins, if we neglect the duty of habitual repentance, and if we pretend that Christ with save us, or that the mere Sacrament will save us, without our feeling in our hearts any great hatred of iniquity. Let us therefore never think after we have pronounced those words, that sin can be counted too great an evil, that temptations to sin can be too much avoided, that repentance can ev∣er be too deep or serious, or that things in this respect can, as the world imagine, be ever carried too far.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="035296_0313_1001C1D59092C858"/>
Once more—we are supposed at the end of the ser∣vice each of us to declare, "and here we offer and pre∣sent unto thee ourselves, and souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto thee." Do we then indeed and in truth thus devote ourselves to God? To have said these words, and to have repeated them again and again at the Sacrament, is to have done little. By these words it is meant, not only that a so∣lemn service should be performed, and that a moment∣ary feeling should be expressed, but it is intended also to imply that we purpose actually to employ all our pow∣ers and faculties, whether of body or of soul, our time, our wealth, our abilities, and our influence in the cause of our Maker and our Redeemer; for <HI>we are not our own, but are bought with a price;</HI> a life really laid out in the service of God is therefore to be expected in a com∣municant. To redeem each precious moment of our time by employing it in whatever is our most proper and most urgent work, to shake off our natural indo∣lence and sloth, and to go from the Lord's table into scenes of diligence and usefulness: thus to join together the love of God and of man, and to be active as well as to be devout, is to be consistent in our character as christians.</P>
<P>If then we have attended at the table of the Lord, <HI>let us not forget to do good, and to distribute;</HI> for these al∣so are <HI>sacrifices with which God is well pleased.</HI> Let us not only pour out our hearts in prayer, but let us al∣so employ our active powers in the Lord's service. <HI>Let us be stedfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> Let us <HI>keep under our body, and bring it into subjection.</HI> Let us command our passions, and restrain our tongues. Let us also be punctual in our engagements, upright, exemplary Let us be <HI>zeal∣ously affected in every good cause;</HI> and while we <HI>visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,</HI> let us take equal care that <HI>we keep our selves unspotted from the world.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF MR. FANTOM, THE NEW FASHIONED PHILOSOPHER, AND HIS MAN WILLIAM.</HEAD>
<P>MR. FANTOM was a retail trader in the city of London. As he had no turn to any expensive vices, he was reckoned a sober, decent man, but he was covetous and proud, selfish and conceited. As soon as he got forward in the world, his vanity began to dis∣play itself, but not in the ordinary method of making a figure, and living away; but still he was tormented with a longing desire to draw public notice, and to distin∣guish himself. He felt a general sense of discontent at what he was, with a general ambition to be something which he was not; but this desire had not yet turned it∣self to any particular object. It was not by his money he could hope to be distinguished, for half his acquaint∣ance had more, and a man must be rich indeed, to be noted for his riches in London. Mr. Fantom's mind was a prey to vain imaginations. He despised all those little acts of kindness and charity which every man is called to perform every day, and while he was contriv∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> grand schemes which lay quite out of his reach, he
<PB N="221" REF="035296_0315_1001C1DC552690E8"/>neglected the ordinary duties of life which lay directly before him.</P>
<P>About this time he got hold of a famous little book written by the new philosopher, whose pestilent doc∣trines found a ready entrance into Mr. Fantom's mind; a mind at once shallow and inquisitive, speculative and vain, ambitious and dissatisfied. As almost every book was new to him, he fell into the common error of those who begin to read late in life, that of thinking that what he did not know himself was equally new to o∣thers; and he was apt to fancy that he and the author he was reading were the only two people in the world who knew any thing. This book led to the grand discovery; he had now found what his heart panted after, a way to <HI>distinguish himself.</HI> To start out a full grown philoso∣pher at once, to be wise without education, to dispute without learning, and to make proselytes without ar∣gument, was a short cut to fame; which well suited his vanity and his ignorance. He rejoiced that he had been so clever as to examine for himself, pitied his friends who took things upon trust, and was resolved to assert the freedom of his own mind. To a man fond of bold novelties and daring paradoxes, solid argument would be flat, and truth would be dull, merely because it is not new. Mr. Fantom believed, not in propor∣tion to the strength of the evidence, but to the impu∣dence of the assertion. The trampling on holy ground with dirty shoes, the smearing the sanctuary with filth and mire, the calling prophets and apostles by the most scurrilous names, was new, and dashing, and dazzling. Mr. Fantom now being set free from the chains of slavery and superstition, was resolved to show his zeal in the usual way, by trying to free others, but it would have hurt his vanity had he known that he was the convert of a man who had written only for the vulgar, who had invented nothing, no, not even one idea of original wickedness; but who had stooped to rake up
<PB N="222" REF="035296_0316_1001C1E273534070"/>out of the kennel of infidelity, all the loathsome dregs and offal dirt, which politer unbelievers had thrown a∣way as too gross and offensive for their better bred rea∣ders.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom, who considered that a philosopher must set up with a little sort of stock in trade, now pick∣ed up all the common place notions against christianity, which have been answered a hundred times over: these he kept by him ready cut and dried, and brought ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all companies with a zeal which would have done honor to a better cause, but which the friends to a bet∣ter cause are not so apt to discover. He soon got all the cant of the new school. He talked of narrowness, and ignorance, and bigotry, and prejudice, and priest cast, on the one hand; and on the other of public good, the love of mankind, and liberality, and candor, and tole∣ration, and above all, benevolence. Benevolence, he said, made up the whole of religion, and all the other parts of it were nothing but cant, and jargon, and hy∣pocrisy. Finding, however, that he made little im∣pression on his old club at the Cat and Bagpipes, he grew tired of their company, yet there was one mem∣ber whose society he could not resolve to give up, tho' they seldom agreed, as indeed no two men in the same class and habits of life could less resemble each other.— Mr. Trueman was an honest, plain, simple hearted tradesman of the good old cut, who feared God and followed his business, he went to church twice on Sun∣days, and minded his shop all the week, spent frugally, gave liberally, and saved moderately.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom resolved to retire for a while into the country, and devote his time to his new plans, schemes, theories, and projects for the public good. A life of talking, and reading, and writing, and disputing, and teaching, and proselyting now struck him as the only life, so he soon set out for the country with his family, to which was now added his new footman, William
<PB N="223" REF="035296_0317_1001C1E7D4F79D60"/>Wilson, whom he had taken with a good character out of a sober family. He was no sooner settled than he wrote to invite Mr. Trueman to come and pay him a visit, for he would have burst if he could not have got some one to whom he might display his new knowledge. He knew that if on the one hand, Trueman was no scholar, yet on the other he was no fool, and though he despised his prejudices, yet he thought he might be made a good decoy duck, for if he could once bring Trueman over, the whole club at the Cat and Bag∣pipes might be brought to follow his example, and thus he might see himself at the head of a society of his own proselytes, the supreme object of a philosopher's ambition. Trueman came accordingly. He soon found that however he might be shocked at the impious doc∣trines his friend maintained, yet that an important les∣son might be learnt even from the worst enemies of truth; namely, an ever-wakeful attention to their grand object. If they set out with talking of trade or poli∣tics; of private news or public affairs, still Mr. Fan∣tom was ever on the watch to hitch in his darling doc∣trines; whatever he began with, he was sure to end with a pert squib at the Bible, a vapid jest on the cler∣gy, the miseries of superstition, and the blessings of philosophy. "Oh!" said Trueman to himself, "when shall I see christians half so much in earnest? Why is it that almost all zeal is on the wrong side?"</P>
<P>"Well, Mr. Fantom," said Trueman next day at breakfeast, "I am afraid you are leading but an idle sort of life here." "Sir," said Fantom, "I now begin to live to some purpose; I have indeed lost too much time, and wasted my talents on a little retail trade, in which one is of no note; one can't distinguish one's self." "So much the better," said Trueman, "I had rather not distinguish myself, unless it was by leading a better life than my neighbors. There is nothing I should dread more than being talked about. I dare say now heaven is in a good measure filled with people
<PB N="224" REF="035296_0318_1001C1EE7285F1D8"/>whose names were never heard out of their own street or village. So I beg leave not to distinguish myself." "Yes, but one may if it is only by signing one's name to an essay or a paragraph in a newspaper," said Fan∣tom. "Heaven keep John Trueman's name out of a newspaper," interrupted he in a fright, "for it must either be found in the Old Bailey or the Bankrupt List, unless indeed, I were to remove shop, or sell off my old stock." "But in your present confined situation you can be of no use," said Fantom. "That I deny," interrupted the other. "I have filled all the parish of∣fices with some credit. I never took a bribe at an elec∣tion, no, not so much as a treat; I take care of my apprentices, and don't set them a bad example by run∣ning to plays and Sadler's Wells in the week, or jaun∣ting about in a gig all day on Sundays; for I look up∣on it that the country jaunt of the master on Sundays exposes his servants to more danger than their whole week's temptations in trade put together."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I once had the same vulgar prejudices about the church and the sabbath, and all that antiquated stuff. But even on your own narrow principles, how can a thinking being spend his Sunday better (if he must lose one day in seven by having any Sunday at all) than by going into the country to admire the works of nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you mean the works of God; for I never read in the bible that nature made any thing. I should rather think that she herself was made by him who made all things; by him, who, when he said, <HI>thou shalt not murder,</HI> said also, <HI>thou shalt keep holy the sab∣bath day.</HI> But now do you really think that all that multitude of coaches, chariots, chaises, vis-a-vis, boo∣by-hutches, sulkies, sociables, phaetons, gigs, curri∣cles, cabrioles, chairs, stages, pleasure-carts and horses, which crowd our roads; all those country houses with∣in reach, to which the London friends pour in to the gorgeous Sunday feast, which the servants are kept
<PB N="225" REF="035296_0319_1001C1F55FB30D20"/>from church to dress; all those public houses under the signs of which you read these alluring words, AN OR∣DINARY ON SUNDAYS; I say, do you believe that all those houses and carriages are crammed with philoso∣phers who go on Sundays into the country to admire the works of nature as you call it? Indeed, from the reeling gait of some of them when they go back at night, one might take them for a certain sect called the <HI>tipling</HI> philosophers. Then in answer to your charge, that a little tradesman can do no good, I must tell you that I belong to the society for relieving prisoners for small debts, and to the sick man's friend, and to.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have a plan in my head for relieving the miseries of the whole world. Every thing is bad as it now stands. I would alter all the laws, and do away all the religions, and put an end to all the wars in the world. I would every where redress the injustice of for∣tune, or what the vulgar call providence. I would put an end to all punishments, I would not leave a single prisoner on the face of the globe. This is what I call doing things on a grand scale. "A scale with a ven∣geance," said Trueman. "As to releasing the prison∣ers, however, I don't so much like that, as it would be pleasing a few rogues at the expence of all honest men;
<PB N="226" REF="035296_0320_1001C1F9EE5E0E60"/>but as to the rest of your plan, if all christian countries would be so good as to turn christians, it might be help∣ed on a good deal. There would be still misery enough left indeed, because God intended this world should be earth and not heaven. But still, banishing irreligion from the world would be like striking off all the pounds from an over charged bill; and all the troubles which would be left, would be reduced to mere shillings, pence, and farthings, as one may say."</P>

<P>Your project would rivet the chains which mine is designed to break.</P>

<P>Sir, I have no projects. Projects are in general the offspring of restlessness, vanity, and idle∣ness. I am too busy for projects, too contented for theories, and I hope, have too much humility for a phi∣losopher. The utmost extent of my ambition at pre∣sent is, to redress the wrongs of a parish 'prentice who has been cruelly used by his master; indeed, I have a∣nother little scheme, which is to prosecute a fellow in our street who has let a poor wretch in a work-house, of which he had the care, perish through neglect, and you must assist me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The parish must do that, as to me I own that the wrongs of the Poles and South Americans so fill my mind, as to leave me no time to attend the pet∣ty sorrows of work-houses and parish 'prentices. It is provinces, empires, continents, that the benevolence of the philosopher embraces; every one can do a little pal∣try good to his next neighbor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one can, but I don't see every one does. If they would, indeed, your business would be ready done to your hands, and your grand ocean of be∣nevolence would be filled with the drops which private charity would throw into it. I am glad, however, you are such a friend to the prisoners, because I am just now getting a little subscription from our club, to set free your poor old friend, Tom Saunders, a very honest
<PB N="227" REF="035296_0321_1001C2010606EC48"/>brother tradesman, who first got into debt and then in∣to gaol, through no fault of his own, but merely thro' the pressure of the times. We have each of us allow∣ed a trifle every week towards maintaining Tom's young family since he has been in prison, but we think we shall do much more service to Saunders, and indeed in the end lighten our own expence, by paying down at once a little sum to restore to him the comforts of life and put him in a way of maintaining his family a∣gain. We have made up the money all except five guineas, I am already promised four, and you have no∣thing to do but to give me the fifth. And so for a sin∣gle guinea, without any of the trouble, the meetings, and the looking into his affairs, which we have had, you will at once have the pleasure (and it is no small one) of helping to save a worthy family from starving, of redeeming an old friend from gaol, and of putting a little of your boasted benevolence into action. Realize! master Fantom, there is nothing like realizing. "Why hearkee, Mr. Trueman," said Fantom stammering, and looking very black, "don't think I value a guinea; no Sir, I despise money, 'tis trash, 'tis dirt, and be∣neath the regard of a wise man. 'Tis one of the un∣feeling inventions of artificial society. Sir I could talk to you for half a day on the abuse of riches, and on my own contempt of money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>O pray don't give yourself the trouble, it will be an easier way by half of proving both, just to put your hand in your pocket and give me the guinea without saying a word about it; and then to you who value time so much and money so little, it will cut the matter short. But come now (for I see you will give nothing) I should be mighty glad to know what is the sort of good you do yourselves, since you always ob∣ject to what is done by others. "Sir," said Mr. Fan∣tom, "the object of a true philosopher is to diffuse light
<PB N="228" REF="035296_0322_1001C2046345C900"/>and knowledge. I wish to see the whole world enlight∣ened."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amen! if you mean with the light of the gospel. But if you mean that one religion is as good as another, and that no religion is the best of all; in short, if you want to make the whole world philoso∣phers, why they had better stay as they are. But as to the true light, I wish it to reach the very lowest, and I therefore bless God for charity schools, as instruments of diffusing it.</P>
<P>Fantom, who had no reason to expect that his friend was going to call upon him for a subscription on this ac∣count, ventured to praise them, saying, "I am no en∣emy to these institutions. I would indeed change the object of instruction, but I would have the whole world instructed."</P>
<P>Here Mrs. Fantom, who with her daughter had qui∣etly sat by at their work, ventured to put in a word, a liberty she seldom took with her husband, who in his zeal to make the whole world free and happy, was too prudent to include his wife. "Then my dear," said she, "I wonder you don't let your own servants be taught a little. The maids can scarcely tell a letter, or say the Lord's prayer; and you know you won't allow them time to learn. William too has never been at church since we came out of town. He was at first very orderly and obedient, but now he is seldom sober of an evening, and in the morning when he should be rubbing the tables in the parlor, he is generally lolling upon them and reading your little manual of the new philosophy." "Mrs. Fantom," said her husband an∣grily, "you know that my labors for the public good, leave me little time to think of my own family. I must have a great field, I like to do good to hundreds at once."</P>
<P>"I am very glad of that papa," said Miss Polly, "for then I hope you won't refuse to subscribe to all those
<PB N="229" REF="035296_0323_1001C206940BAB08"/>pretty children at the Sunday school as you did yesterday, when the gentleman came a begging, because that is the very thing you were wishing for; there are two or three hundred to be done good to at once."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Mr. Fantom, you are a wonderful man to keep up such a stock of benevolence at so small an expence. To love mankind so dearly and yet avoid all opportunities of doing them good; to have such a noble zeal for the millions, and to feel so little compas∣sion for the units; surely none but a philosopher could indulge so much philanthropy and so much frugality at the same time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I despise the man whose benevolence is swal∣lowed up in the narrow concerns of his own family, or parish, or country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I have a notion that 'tis as well to do one's own duty as that of another man, and to do good at home as well as abroad, and I had as lieve help Tom Saunders to freedom as a Pole or a South American, though I should be very glad to help them too, but one must begin to love somewhere, and to do good somewhere; and I think 'tis as natural to love one's own family and to do good in one's own neigh∣borhood as to any body else. And if every man in eve∣ry family, parish, and county, did the same, why! all the schemes would meet, and the end of one parish where I was doing good, would be the beginning of ano∣ther, where somebody else was doing good; so my schemes would jut into my neighbors, and all would fit with a sort of dove-tail exactness.</P>
<P>Here they were told dinner was on table. "Don't think," said Mr. Fantom, "that you have the best of the argument, because you happen to have the last word. We will finish our talk some other time." So saying they went in to dinner.</P>
<P>When t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> sat down, Mr. Fantom was not a little out of humor, to see his table in some disorder. Wil∣liam
<PB N="230" REF="035296_0324_1001C20C72EAD9E0"/>was also rather more negligent than usual. If the company called for bread, he gave them beer, and he took away the clean plates, and gave them dirty ones. Mr. Fantom soon discovered that his servant was very drunk; he flew into a violent passion, and ordered him out of the room, charging that he should not appear in his presence in that condition. William obeyed; but having slept an hour or two, and got about half sober, he again made his appearance. His master gave him a severe reprimand, and called him an idle, drunken, vicious fellow. "Sir," said William, very pertly, "if I do get drunk now and then, I only do it for the good of my country, and in obedience to your wishes." Mr. Fantom, thoroughly provoked, now began to scold him in words not fit to be repeated, and asked him what he meant. "Why, Sir," said William, "you are a philosopher you know, and I have often over∣heard you say to your company, that private vices are public benefits, and so I thought that getting drunk was as pleasant a way of doing good to the public as any, especially when I could oblige my master at the same time."</P>
<P>"Get out of my house," said Mr. Fantom, in a great rage. "I do not desire to stay a moment longer, so pay me my wages." "Not I, indeed," replied the master, "nor will I give you a character, so never let me see your face again." William took his master at his word, and not only got out of the house, but out of the country too as fast as possible. When they found he was really gone, they made a hue-and-cry, in order to detain him till they had examined if he had left eve∣ry thing in the house as he had found it. But William had got out of reach, knowing he could not stand such a scrutiny. On examination, Mr. Fantom found that all his port was gone, and Mrs. Fantom missed three of her best new spoons. William was pursued, but without success, and Mr. Fantom was so much dis∣composed,
<PB N="231" REF="035296_0325_1001C2127AB37358"/>that he could not for the rest of the day talk of any thing but his wine and his spoons, nor harangue on any project but that of recovering both by bringing William to justice.</P>
<P>Some days past away, in which Mr. Fantom having had time to cool, began to be ashamed that he had been betrayed into such ungoverned passion. He made the best excuse he could, said no man was perfect, and though he owned he had been too violent, yet he still hoped William would be brought to the punishment he deserved. "In the mean time," said Mr. Trueman, "seeing how ill philosophy has agreed with your man, suppose you were to set about teaching your maids a lit∣tle religion?" Mr. Fantom coolly replied, "that the impertinent retort of a drunken footman could not spoil a system." "Your system, however, and your own behavior," said Trueman, "have made that footman a scoundrel; and you are answerable for his offences."— "Not I, truly," said Fantom, "he has seen me do no harm; he has neither seen me cheat, gamble, nor get drunk: and I defy you to say I corrupt my servants. I am a moral man, Sir." "Mr. Fantom," said True∣man, "if you were to get drunk every day, and game every night, you would indeed endanger your own soul, and give a dreadful example to your family; but great as those sins are, and God forbid that I should attempt to lessen them, still they are not worse, nay, they are not so bad as the pestilent doctrines with which you infect your house and your neighborhood. A bad action is like a single murder, but a wicked principle is throwing lighted gun powder into a town, it is poisoning a river; there are no bounds, no certain∣ty, no end to its mischief. The ill effects of the worst action may cease in time, and the consequences of your example may end with your life; but souls may be bro't to perdition by a wicked principle, after the author of it has been dead for ages.</P>

<P>You take all your notions of the Deity from the vulgar views your bible gives you of him.—"To be sure I do," said Trueman, "can you tell me any way of getting a better notion of him? I don't want any of your farthing candle philosophy in the broad sun-shine of the gospel, Mr. Fantom. My bi∣ble tells me that <HI>God is love,</HI> not merely loving, but <HI>love.</HI> Now do you think a being whose very essence is love, would permit any misery among his children here, if it was not to be some way or other, or some∣where or other, for their good? You forget too that in a world where there is sin there must be misery.—Then, too, I suppose, God permits misery partly to exercise the sufferers, and partly to try the prosperous; for by trouble God corrects some and tries others.—Suppose now, Tom Saunders had not been put in pri∣son, you and I—no, I beg pardon, <HI>you</HI> saved your guinea: well then, our club and I could not have shown our kindness by getting him out, nor would poor Saunders himself have had an opportunity of exercising his own patience under want and imprisonment. So you see one reason why God permits misery is, that good men may have an opportunity of lessening it."—Mr. Fantom replied, "There is no object which I have more at heart; I have as I told you a plan in my head of such universal benevolence as to include the happi∣ness
<PB N="233" REF="035296_0327_1001C21B97CFFE38"/>of all mankind." "Mr. Fantom," said Trueman, "I feel that I have a general good will towards all my brethren of mankind; and if I had as much money in my purse as I have love in my heart, I trust I should prove it; all I say is, that in a station of life where I can't do much, I am more called upon to procure the happiness of a poor neighbor who has no one else to look to, than to form wild plans for the good of man∣kind too extensive to be accomplished, and too chime∣rical to be put in practice. I can't free whole countries, nor reform the evils of society at large, but I <HI>can</HI> free an aggrieved wretch in a work-house, and I can re∣form myself and my own family."</P>
</SP>
<P>Some weeks after a letter was brought to Mr. Fan∣tom from his late servant William, who had been turn∣ed away for drunkenness, as related in the former part of this history, and who had also robbed his master of some wine and some spoons. Mr. Fantom glancing his eye over the letter said, "it is dated from Chelmsford jail; that rascal is got into prison. I am glad of it with all my heart, it is the fittest place for such scoundrels. I hope he will be sent to Botany Bay, if not hanged." "O ho! my good friend," said Trueman, "then I find that in abolishing all prisons you would just let one stand for the accommodation of those who should hap∣pen to rob <HI>you.</HI>" Mr. Fantom drily observed, that he was not fond of jokes, and proceeded to read the let∣ter. It expressed an earnest wish that his late master would condescend to pay him one visit in his dark and doleful abode, as he wished to say a few words to him before the dreadful sentence of the law, which had al∣ready been pronounced, should be executed."</P>
<P>"Let us go and see the poor fellow," said Trueman, "it is but a morning's ride. If he is really so near his end, it would be cruel to refuse him." "Not I truly," said Fantom, "he deserves nothing at my hands but the halter he is likely to meet with. Such port as is
<PB N="234" REF="035296_0328_1001C222C98E4DE8"/>not to be had for money, and the spoons part of my new dozen." "As to the wine," said Trueman, "I am afraid you must give that up, but the only way to get any tidings of the spoons is to go and hear what he has to say; I have no doubt but he will make such a confession as may be very useful to others, which, you know, is one grand advantage of punishments; and be∣sides, we may afford him some little comfort." "As to comfort he deserves none from me," said Fantom, "and as to his confessions they can be of no use to me, but as they give me a chance of getting my spoons, so I don't much care if I do take a ride with you."</P>
<P>When they came to the prison Mr. Trueman's ten∣der heart sunk within him. He deplored the corrupt nature of man, which makes such rigorous confine∣ment needful, not merely for the punishment of the of∣fender, but for the safety of society. Fantom, from mere trick and habit, was just preparing a speech on general benevolence, and the cruelty of imprisonment, till the recollection of his old port and his new spoons cooled his ardor, and he went on without saying a word. When they reached the cell where the unhap∣py William was confined, they stopped at the door.—The poor wretch had thrown himself on the ground as well as his chains would give him leave. He groaned piteously, and was so swallowed up wich a sense of his own miseries, that he neither heard the door open, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the gentlemen. He was attempting to pray, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an agony which made his words hardly intelligible. Thus much they could make out—"God be merciful to me a sinner—the chief of sinners!" then suddenly attempting to start up, but prevented by his irons, he roared out, "O God! thou canst <HI>not</HI> be merciful to me for I have denied thee; I have ridiculed my Sa∣viour who died for me; I have derided his word, I have resisted his spirit. I have laughed at that heaven which is shut against me, I have denied those torments
<PB N="235" REF="035296_0329_1001C22840F17098"/>which await me. To-morrow! to-morrow! O for a longer space for repentance, O for a short reprieve from hell." Mr. Trueman wept so loud that it drew the attention of the criminal, who now lifted up his eyes, and cast on his late master a look so dreadful, that Fantom wished for a moment that he had given up all hope of the spoons rather than have exposed himself to such a scene. At length the poor wretch, said, in a voice that would have melted a heart of stone, "O Sir, are you there? I did wish to see you before my dread∣ful sentence is put in execution. O Sir! to-morrow, to-morrow! But I have a confession to make to you." This revived Mr. Fantom, who again ventured to glance a hope at the spoons. "Sir," said William, "I could not die without making my confession." "Aye, and restitution too I hope," replied Fantom. "Where are my spoons?"—"Sir, they are gone with the rest of my wretched booty. But O Sir! these spoons make so petty an article in my black account that I hardly think of them. Murder, Sir, murder is the crime for which I am justly doomed to die. O Sir! Who can dwell with everlasting burnings?" As this was a ques∣tion which even a philosopher could not answer, Mr. Fantom was going to steal off, especially as he now gave up all hope of the spoons: but William called him back. "Stay, Sir, stay, I conjure you, as you will answer it at the bar of God. You are the cause of my being about to suffer a shameful death. Yes, Sir, you made me a drunkard, a thief, and a murder∣er." "How dare you, William," cried Mr. Fantom, with great emotion, "accuse me with being the cause of such horrid crimes?" "Sir," answered the criminal, "from you I learnt the principles which lead to those crimes. By the grace of God I should never have fal∣len into sins deserving of the gallows if I had not often overheard you say there was no hereafter, no judgment, no future reckoning, O Sir! there is a hell, dreadful,
<PB N="236" REF="035296_0330_1001C22CC01EF5C8"/>inconceivable, eternal!" Here through the excess of anguish, the poor fellow fainted away. Mr. Fantom, who did not at all relish this scene, said to his friend, "well Sir, we will go if you please, for you see there is nothing to be done."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Mr. Trueman, mournfully, "you may go if you please, but I shall stay, for I see there is a great deal to be done. "What," rejoined the other, "do you think it possible his life can be saved?" "No, indeed," said Trueman, "but I hope it is possible his soul may be saved." I don't understand these things," said Fantom, making towards the door. "Nor I nei∣ther", said Trueman, "but as a fellow sinner I am bound to do what I can for this poor fellow. Do you go home Mr. Fantom, and finish your treatise on uni∣versal benevolence, and the blessed effects of philosophy; and hark ye, be sure you let the frontispiece of your book represent <HI>William on the gibbet;</HI> that will be what our parson calls a <HI>practical illustration.</HI> You know I hate theories; this is <HI>realiving;</HI> this is philosophy made easy to the meanest capacity."</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom sneaked off to finish his work at home, and Mr. Trueman staid to finish his in the prison. He passed the night with the wretched convict, he prayed with him and for him, and read to him the penitential psalms, and some portions of the gospel. But he was too humble and too prudent a man to venture out of his depth by arguments and consolations which he was not warranted to use. This he left for the minister.—But he pressed on William the great duty of making the only amends now in his power to those whom he had led astray. They then drew up the following paper which Mr. Trueman got printed, and gave away at the place of execution.</P>

<HEAD>The last words, confession, and dying speech of <HI>WIL∣LIAM WILSON,</HI> who was executed at Chelms∣ford for murder.</HEAD>
<P>I was bred up in the fear of God, and lived with credit in many sober families, in which I was a faithful servant. But being tempted by a little higher wages, I left a good place to go and live with Mr. Fantom, who, however, made good none of his fine promises, but proved a hard master. In his service I was not al∣lowed time to go to church. This troubled me at first, till I overheard my master say, that going to church was a superstitious prejudice, and only meant for the vulgar. Upon this I resolved to go no more; for I thought there could not be two religions, one for the master, and one for the servant. Finding my master never prayed, I too left off praying, this gave Satan great power over me, so that I from that time fell into almost every sin. I was very uneasy at first, and my conscience gave me no rest; but I was soon reconciled by overhearing my master and another gentleman say, that death was only a long sleep, and hell and judgment were but an invention of priests to keep the poor in or∣der. I mention this as a warning to all masters and mistresses to take care what they converse about while servants are waiting at table. They cannot tell how many souls they have sent to perdition by such loose talk. The crime for which I die is the natural conse∣quence of the principles I learnt of my master. A rich man, indeed, who throws off religion, may escape the gallows, because want does not drive him to commit the crimes which lead to it; but what shall restrain a needy man, who has been taught that there is no dread∣ful reckoning? Oh, my dear fellow servants! take warning by my sad fate, never be tempted away from a sober service for the sake of a little more wages. Never venture your immortal souls in houses whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e God is not

<P>Mr. Trueman would never leave this poor penitent till he was launched into eternity, but attended him with the minister in the Cart. This pious minister never cared to tell what he thought of William's state.—When I ventured to mention my hope, that though his penitence was late yet it was sincere, and spoke of the dying thief on the cross as a ground of encouragement, the minister, with a very serious look, made me this answer, "Sir, that instance is too often brought for∣ward on occasions to which it does not apply: I do not choose to say any thing to your application of it in the present case, but I will answer you in the words of a good man speaking of the penitent thief." There is <HI>one</HI> such instance given that nobody might despair, and there is <HI>but</HI> one, that nobody might presume.</P>

<HEAD>THE HUBBUB; OR, THE HISTORY OF FARMER RUSSEL, <HI>The hard-hearted Overseer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE oldest man living at Compton-Ashby, can∣not call to mind such another hubbub as that which happened there some months ago, on the com∣mon, just before the poor-house door. A number of men, women, and children, had formed a ring round one farmer Russel, a sullen, down-looking fellow, whom no one loved and every one feared; for his love of mo∣ney had led him to be hard-hearted, and his power over the poor had made him insolent. Never was there such a hissing and hooting, and hallooing heard. Many of these people had been grievously oppressed by the far∣mer, and now they had him in their power, they seem∣ed resolved to shew him little mercy.</P>
<P>Betty Jobbins beat the frying-pan with the key of the door, Sally Gore pounded the pestle and mortar, Nelly Shepston rung the warming-pan, Dick Devon∣shire blew the Ram's-horn, whilst Nick Stafford and others gingled the sheeps' bells. It so happened that one Mr. Britton rode up at the instant to enquire what was the matter, of two poor women who were sitting in the porch of the poor-house. One of them, Amy Talbot, seemed to be about sixty years of age, but time
<PB N="240" REF="035296_0334_1001C23EC2231E80"/>had not cured Amy of gossiping, or taught her to mend her cloaths. As she had no turn for industry in her youth, she soon eat and drank up the little property left her by her parents, which might now have afforded her a comfortable maintenance; but no, Amy's tongue was always abusive and always busy, whilst her fingers were seldom employed. Wherever there was a gossip∣ing in the parish, thither ran Amy with her rags flying about her, like a scare-crow in a cherry tree. Her skin which was quite tawny, was never washed; her hair had worked itself thro' the holes of her mob, half the bor∣der of which was lost, and the flaps of it were always flying behind her; the pigs had one day eaten a hole thro' her hat as it lay on the ground, and a piece of it now hung over her eye like a black patch, her petticoats were all tatters, and her gown reached but little below her knees; it had been torn away bit by bit, till it was ravelled out to the above dimensions; her stockings had no feet, and her feet were slipped into a miserable pair of shoes, which she had not taken the trouble to draw up at heel, even when they were new; in one hand she clenched her rags together, whilst with the other, she held a short pipe in her mouth resting her elbow on her knee, as she sat cross-legged.</P>
<P>The other poor woman whose name was Apsley, was of a very different cast from Amy; she was the picture of cleanliness and good housewifery; she was mending her apron, which though very coarse, was as white as the driven snow; this good woman never sat at the door to take the air, but she was doing some∣thing; "it is a duty," she would say, "to turn our time to the best account we can," and when her other employment was over she would read a chapter in her bible. Mr. Britton asked her what occasioned the up∣roar, and at the same time slipped half a crown into her hand, giving afterwards a few half-pence to Amy, which he thought was more than such a dirty woman deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="035296_0335_1001C240F00AE3A0"/>
"Why Sir, cried Amy, pocketing her pence, "I'll tell you all how and about it; don't you see that sulky <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l-looking fellow of a farmer, so hooted at by the peo∣ple? he is a fine rare crusty old blade, and has hectored over the parish at a fine rate; he is always at law with the parson about tithes, and with his neighbors upon the slightest provocation; besides Sir, he is overseer of the poor, and a poor time we have had on't, but thanks be praised, 'tis come home to the wretch at last." Then she fell to hooting and hissing, till she foamed at the mouth again; which having wiped off with the corner of her gown, she said, "now Sir, I'll tell you: that fellow's stomach has been well filled with every thing of the best, whilst he has starved we poor almost to death, but 'tis likely to come home to him at last, and he may chance to swing for it, and then we shall all be revenged of him," and again she fell to clapping her hands.</P>
<P>"Prithee Amy," replied dame Apsley very camly, "don't give way to such evil tempers; we have been hardly used by the farmer to be sure, but if we are christians, we must learn to forget and forgive." "If ever I forgive the villain," cried Amy, knocking the dust out of her pipe, "may I never get another quar∣tern of tobacco; revenge is sweet, Sir, revenge is sweet."</P>
<P>"To an unchristian temper I grant it is," said Mr. Britton, "but revenge is the worst passion that can en∣ter the human breast, it is the very spirit of Satan."</P>
<P>"It is a very fine remark truly, Sir," said dame Ap∣sley, "for to my thinking, a man who is always nurs∣ing up an evil passion in his bosom, is as if he cherish∣ed a serpent there, which must sting him to death at last; yet, Sir, I must be bold to say, much as I want money, I would not accept of sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer Russel's fortune, if I must take up the heavy burden of his crimes into the bargain." "Ah! dame, dame," interrupted Amy,
<PB N="242" REF="035296_0336_1001C24759317A68"/>"preach as you please, I am glad at heart 'tis come home to the villain at last, things can't go on worse with us."</P>
<P>"Nor perhaps much better," answered dame Ap∣sley, "for, after all, 'tis a very unthankful office to have much to do with poor people, especially if they have not the fear of God before their eyes; because then they are abusive, and ungrateful to those who are guar∣dians over them; for the matter of that, Amy, have we not several old people in this poor house, who have been drunken, idle, blaspheming people all their lives; and though we live so near to the church, not one of them has seen the inside of it for many years past, unless when there has been Christmas gifts' money to be giv∣en away; but I think if I were the parson, Amy, eve∣ry Lord's day I would drive the whole posse into church before me, if they were able to set one foo before anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>." "My good woman," said Mr. Brit∣ton, "I am mightily pleased to see how usefully you employ your time, for you have continued your work ever since we have been chatting together." "Time, Sir, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he gift of God, and I must account to him for it; besides, Sir, often when I am busily employed at my needle, I can ponder on some text of scripture; and I can say with king David, <HI>As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, thy help, O God, shall lift me up.</HI> Now, Sir, although I am very poor, that is no reason why I should not be very clean; if my clothing be coarse, that is no excuse for its being ragged, and if I am lame in my feet, that is no cause for my fingers being idle; besides, Sir, a stitch in time saves nine, and I frequently get a shilling by mending stays, or quilt∣ing of servants' petticoats, when my health will per∣mit."</P>
<P>"Ah! well," interrupted Amy, "I never had the heart to work unless I were better paid for it. But I say, dame, I will say, that I am glad at heart farmer Rus∣sel
<PB N="243" REF="035296_0337_1001C24D418C7048"/>is in hold at last; <HI>live</HI> and <HI>let live,</HI> is my notion of the thing; but no, he went on from day to day, crib∣bing and scraping something out of every body; and no sooner did he get a little uppish in the world, than he took no more account of poor we, than if we had been so many hedge-hogs, for all he was born and bred a∣mongst us; but for the matter of that, he han't been much kinder to his own family, for you must know, Sir, his bitter temper caused his only son to run away from him, nor has any tale or tidings ever been heard of him." Here again Amy began hissing and hooting the farmer, insomuch that Mr. Britton began to think he should never get at the end of the story.</P>
<P>"Now, Sir," cried Amy at last, whilst she filled her pipe, "now I have got breath again, I'll tell you all how and about it. You must know last hard winter. Sir, when bread was so dear, and coals were so scarce, farmer Russel would not let the parish be at the expence of mending the thatch on our house, so that when the snow melted it ran in streams down on dame's bed, by which she lost the use of her limbs, and she has hob∣bled with crutches ever since: yet she, foolish woman, seldom complains: but off she goes to her Bible for comfort, as another body would to a glass of gin, or a pot of beer, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings go amiss."</P>
<P>"The troubles of life," said dame Apsley, "are but as shadows which pass away; but the christian's rest will be eternal: and certain I am, Sir, my weak nature would often have given way to sinful murmurings, but for the gracious promise of better things in the life to come. O! Sir," continued she, "I have found it much more for my soul's good, to bless Heaven for what I have, than to murmur for what I have not; though, to be sure, I have seen better days," wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.</P>
<P>"Indeed has she, Sir," cried Amy, "for dame's hus∣band was a man well to pass in the world; he rented a
<PB N="244" REF="035296_0338_1001C252B28A9170"/>small farm, and was accounted one of the most indus∣trious men in the country; and as to dame herself, up early and down late was her maxim: when all of a sud∣den comes that same knavish scoundrel there, farmer Russel, and takes farmer Apsley's estate over his head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o was soon after obliged to take up with day-labor∣ing to maintain his family. by-and-by sickness came on, want followed next, farmer Russel seized farmer Apsley's goods for a little debt, and at the end of a long fit of sickness, he and his whole family were brought here to the poor-house, where the man soon after died of a broken heart; and yet, Sir, dame is for forgiving the farmer all this."</P>
<P>"That I do," replied she, "since my blessed Saviour not only forgave his enemies, but prayed to his Heaven∣ly Father to forgive them also; and I should read my Bible to little profit, Amy, if I learnt nothing from so bright an example; but, good Sir," said she, turning to Mr. Britton, "your patience must be quite tired, not to be yet made acquainted with all the hubbub yonder: but most folks are so fond of telling their own stories, that they do not think of other people. There is, Sir, a poor soldier found dead this morning, in the next pa∣rish, and it is thought that farmer Russel has had some concern in the matter, so the people are now going to carry him before a justice to be examined."</P>
<P>"And I hope he will be hanged, I hope he will be hanged," cried Amy, clapping her hands;—"and I hope he will live to repent," cried dame Apsley, wiping her eyes. Mr. Britton's curiosity was now raised, and he attended the mob to the justice's.</P>
<P>Justice Carter was an upright gentleman, just such a man as a justice of the peace ought to be. Before he administered an oath to an ignorant person, "Think a moment, my friend," he would say, "before you kiss this book, whether you can stand to the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what you are going to swear, when you are called to be jud∣ged
<PB N="245" REF="035296_0339_1001C257EE8B4C68"/>for it, before the God of Heaven and earth." No temptation could ever prevail on his worship unjustly to favor any man: the laws, he said, must take their course; if they were found severe, he did not make them: it was his duty to administer them.</P>
<P>"And, please your worship," cried one Jones, who seemed to be the ring-leader of the mob, "we all hope that you will now take revenge for us on the farmer, for all the spiteful tricks he has played us."</P>
<P>"I should make but an ill use of power, Jones," re∣plied the justice, "If I were to do any thing from heat or passion; if the law acquits farmer Russel, I shall rea∣dily dismiss him."</P>
<P>"Well, to be sure," cried the people all in a breath, "your worship must be a very fine christian, to forget and forgive at this rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, to our certain knowledge, the farmer has been a plague to you yourself these ten years, sneering at you many times, and saying that nei∣ther you nor the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> could take hold of him." "Now, do not you see," replied the justice, "that all that has nothing to do with the present matter?"</P>
<P>Then turning over a great book, as big as a church bible, the witness was called, who deposed upon oath, that the last evening, just between light and dark, he saw farmer Russel dragging a soldier-like looking man over Compton bridge, clear out of his own parish into the next, that he there laid him down by the side of a ditch; that at first he, the witness, believed the man to be dead; but that, in a short time, he found the poor fellow had only sainted through weakness; that the wit∣ness had lent the poor soldier all the assistance in his power; but that he was obliged soon after to follow his cattle."</P>
<P>Here the witness's evidence closed. "And could you," said the justice to farmer Russel, "drag a poor traveller out of your parish in this barbarous manner? In order to save your own parish a trifling expence, you
<PB N="246" REF="035296_0340_1001C259E76BACC0"/>did not scruple to risk the life of this poor traveller.— You thought, indeed, that the darkness concealed you; but remember, though it seemed dark, yet the broad eye of the Almighty was upon you."</P>
<P>The farmer then in a surly tone replied, "that the man had no business in his parish, and that as for himself, no one could say he was unkind to the poor, for he paid three times as much to the poor-rates as any man in the parish, (the lord of the manor only excepted.)"— "And reason good," cried ragged Amy, who had fol∣lowed the mob; "because you are the greatest renter in it; for by dishonest practices you have got all the small farms into your own hands; but, farmer, no one has heard you ever gave a penny out of your own pock∣et to the poor, when the laws did not compel you, so no thanks for your charity. And please your worship, e∣very one here knows, that whenever a kind gentleman and lady sent a few shillings to be divided amongst us, if the farmer heard of it he would stop our pay till it was gone."</P>
<P>Both the justice and Mr. Britton quite sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>delered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this act of cruelty, and every one present hoped his wor∣ship would not sail to take ample revenge on the far∣mer.</P>
<P>"My friends," said the justice again, "if my breast harbored revenge against any man, I should be unfit for a magistrate; did you never see the picture of justice painted in my great hall? she is there represented as holding a pair of scales with the balance quite even."</P>
<P>The justice wishing to know some more circumstan∣ces about the man's death, the whole posse now moved off to the place where the corpse lay, attended by Mr. Britton; by the way they accused the farmer of every crime; some of which he had not, and others which he had committed. "Ah!" said one, "who sold eider for the very best, when it was proved it had been half filled up with water?" "Who," said another, "sold his
<PB N="247" REF="035296_0341_1001C25CE274F028"/>hay-ricks, all warranted good, and when they were cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open they were found crammed with musty stuff, fit only for littering cattle?" "And who," cried a third, "carried the best samples of wheat to the market, and afterwards sobbed the buyer off with the very worst?" "And who," bawled out a fourth, "turned his own child out of doors, and mayhap murdered him, for no tidings have been heard of him since?"</P>
<P>Much after this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner they went on, and soon af∣ter the coroner pronounced a verdict of <HI>natura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> death,</HI> no marks of violence being found upon the body.— The farmer now brightened up at once, and sticking his hands in his waistcoat pockets, cast a malignant grin of triumph on all around him: "Now touch me if you dare," cried he, "but if my name be Russel, I'll have my revenge of every man and woman's child of you; and I'll spend a thousand pounds at law, but I'll be a match for some of you. I'll lay an action against you, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Hoskins, for defamation; you have accused me with the murder of my own child, now prove your words if you can." Poor Hoskins turned as pale as death, well knowing the farmer's unforgiving temper.</P>
<P>Here some one searching the pockets of the deceased, was surprized to find in them a letter, not sealed, direct∣ed to farmer Russel, of Compton Ashby. The letter was offered to the farmer, but he refused to take it, ha∣ving always thought it unlucky to touch any thing be∣longing to the dead. The people then requested Mr. Britton to read it aloud, which he at length consented to do.</P>

So I began my march homeward, although with great fear and trembling, pondering in my mind the last words I ever heard you speak, which were, "that you wished I might drop down dead if I ever dared to darken your doors a∣gain;" and calling down heavy curses on yourself if ever you forgave me. And now, as my offence, dear father, was but a slight one, and much have I repented of it, and much shall we all have to be forgiven when we shall appear before God in judgment, so I humbly trust you will receive me kindly, when you see how sick, and how very weak I am.

<P>Many tears were shed whilst Mr. Britton read the letter. "My good friends," said he, when he had fi∣nished it, "let me now give you a word of advice:— Whenever a sick and poor traveller (and especially when a brave British soldier or sailor, who has shed, his blood in fighting for you in foreign parts, and is perhaps escaped from an enemy's prison) knocks at your door to ask for charity, do not refuse him a cup of beer, or a plentiful slice of bread and cheese; to you who abound it is little, to him it may be much; and henceforward let us all learn to look upon every man in distress as a child or a brother; and let us do by him as we would wish to be done by, if we were in his condition. As for you, farmer Russel," continued he "no reproof from me is wanting, for the event that has happened is of itself the most bitter of all reproofs."</P>
<P>"O my son! my son!" at length cried the farmer, (wringing his hands, and tearing his hair with grief) "my own curses have brought on my own destruction! Wretch! wretch! that I am!" (here attempting to rise, he sunk down by the body of his son, and then fell into
<PB N="250" REF="035296_0344_1001C26A91FB2E10"/>such strong convulsion fits, that six of the stoutest men present could not hold him: his limbs were distorted, his face turned black, his eyes looked as if they were bursting out of his head; so dreadful indeed was his si∣tuation, that those who but a moment before hated and reviled him, were now ready to pity him. "What and affecting sight," said Mr. Britton "have we now before us! God grant that it may prove a lesson to us all. It was but a few moments ago that this miserable man, who now lies struggling in the toils of death be∣fore you, was proudly rejoicing that he had escaped the lash of the law."</P>
<P>The farmer's waggon now arrived to carry him home, and it was a most moving sight, to see it followed by the corpse of his son. A doctor was sent for, who the moment he saw the farmer, said he feared he could do nothing for him. Mr. Britton watched by him all night, and when the fits went off for a few minutes, he was heard thus to mutter to himself.</P>
<P>"Of what use to me is all the riches in the world, now the afflicting hand of heaven is upon me? My pun∣ishment is great, great also has been my crime.

<HEAD>TAWNY RACHEL, OR, THE FORTUNE TELLER; <HI>With some account of dreams, omens, and conjurers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TAWNY Rachel was the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of poaching Giles. There seemed to be a conspiracy in Giles's whole family to maintain themselves by tricks and pil∣fering. Regular labor and honest industry did not suit their idle habits. They had a sort of genius at finding out every unlawful means to support a vagabond life. Rachel travelled the country with a basket on her arm. She pretended to get her bread by felling laces, cab∣bage nets, ballads, and history books, and to buy old rags and rabbit skins. Many honest people trade in these things, and I am sure I don't mean to say a word against honest people, let them trade in what they will. But Rachel only made this traffic a pretence for getting admittance into farmers' kitchens, in order to tell for∣tunes. She was continually practising on the creduli∣ty of silly girls; and took adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tage of their ignorance to cheat and deceive them. Many an innocent serv∣ant has she caused to be suspected of a robbery, while she herself, perhaps, was in league with the thief. Ma∣ny a harmless maid has she brought to ruin by first contriving plots and events, and then pretending to for∣tell them. She had not, to be sure, the power of fore∣telling things, because she had no power of seeing into futurity; but she had the art sometimes to bring them about according as she had foretold them. So she got that credit for her wisdom which really belonged to her wickedness.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="035296_0346_1001C2810256C140"/>
Rachel was also a famous interpreter of dreams, and could distinguish exactly between the fate of any two persons who happened to have a mole on the right or the left cheek. She had a cunning way of getting herself off when any of her prophecies failed. When she explained a dream according to the natural appear∣ance of things, and it did not come to pass; then she would get out of that scrape by saying, that "this sort of dreams went by contraries." Now of two very op∣posite things the chance always is that one of them may turn out to be tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, so in either case she kept up the cheat.</P>
<P>Rachel in one of her rambles stopped at the house of Farmer Jenkins. She contrived to call when she knew the master of the house was from home, which indeed was her usual way. She knocked at the door; the maids being out hay-making, Mrs. Jenkins went to open it herself. Rachel asked her if she would please to let her light her pipe? This was a common pre∣tence, when she could find no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er way of getting into a house. While she was filling her pipe, she looked at Mrs. Jenkins and said, she could tell her some good fortune. The farmer's wife, who was a very inoffen∣sive, but a weak and superstitious woman, was curi∣ous to know what she meant. Rachel then looked a∣bout very carefully, and shutting the door with a mys∣terious air, asked her if she was sure nobody would hear them. This appearance of mystery was at once de∣lightful and terrifying to Mrs. Jenkins, who bid the cunning woman speak out. "Then," said Rachel, in a solemn whisper, "there is to my certain knowledge a pot of money hid under one of the stones in your cel∣lar." "Indeed," said Mrs. Jenkins, "it is impossible, for now I think of it, I dreamt last night I was in pri∣son for debt." "Did you indeed?" said Rachel, "that is quite surprising. Did you dream before twelve o'clock or after?" "O it was this morning, just be∣fore
<PB N="253" REF="035296_0347_1001C28787000DA0"/>I awoke. "Then I am sure it is true, for morn∣ing dreams always go by contraries," cried Rachel.— "How lucky it is you dreamt it so late." Mrs. Jen∣kins could hardly contain her joy, and asked "how the money was to be come at." "There is but one way," said Rachel, "I must go into the cellar. I know by my art under which stone it lies, but I must not tell." They then both went down into the cellar, but Rachel refused to point at the stone unless Mrs. Jenkins would put five pieces of gold into a bason and do as she direct∣ed. The simple woman instead of turning her out of doors for a cheat, did as she was bid. She put the gui∣neas into a bason which she gave into Rachel's hand.— Rachel strewed some white powder over the gold, mut∣tered some barbarous words, and pretended to perform the black art. She then told Mrs. Jenkins to put the bason quietly down within the cellar; telling her that it she offered to look into it, or even to speak a word, the charm would be broken. She also directed her to lock the cellar door, and on no pretence to open it in less than forty-eight hours. "If," added she, "you closely follow these directions, then, by the power of my art, you will find the bason conveyed to the very stone under which the money lies hid, and a fine trea∣sure it will be." Mrs. Jenkins who believed every word the woman said, did exactly as she was told, and Rachel took her leave with a handsome reward.</P>
<P>When farmer Jenkins came home he desired his wife to draw him a cup of eider; this she put off doing so long that he began to be displeased. At last she beg∣ged he would drink a little beer instead. He insisted on knowing the reason, and when at last he grew angry, she told him all that had past; and owned that as the pot of gold happened to be in the cider cellar, she did not dare open the door, as she was sure it would break the charm. "And it would be a pity you know," said she, "to lose a good fortune for the sake of a draught of cider."—
<PB N="254" REF="035296_0348_1001C28C180AA1F0"/>The farmer, who was not so easily imposed upon, sus∣pected a trict. He demanded the key, and went and opened the cellar door. He found the bason, and in it five round pieces of tin covered with powder. Mrs. Jenkins burst out a crying; but the farmer thought of nothing but of getting a warrant to apprehend the cunning woman. Indeed she well proved her claim to that name, when she insisted that the cellar door might be kept locked till she had time to get out of the reach of all pursuit.</P>
<P>Poor Sally Evans! I am sure she rued the day that ever she listened to a fortune teller! S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly was as harm∣less a girl as ever churned a pound of butter; but Sal∣ly was ignorant and superstitious. She delighted in dream-books, and had consulted all the cunning wo∣men in the country to tell her whether the two moles on her cheek denoted that she was to have two hus∣bands, or only two children. If she picked up an old horse-shoe going to church she was sure that would be a lucky week. She never made a black-pudding with∣out borrowing one of the Parson's old wigs to hang in the chimney, firmly believing there were no other means to preserve them from bursting. She would ne∣ver go to bed on Midsummer eve without sticking up in her room the well known plant called Midsummer∣man, as the bending of the leaves to the right or to the left, would not fail to tell her whether Jacob, of whom we shall speak presently, was true or false. She would rather go five miles about than pass near a church yard at night. Every seventh year she would not eat beans because they grew downward in the pod, instead of up∣ward; and she would rather have gone with her gown open than have taken a pin of an old woman, for fear of being bewitched. Poor Sally had so many unlucky days in her calendar, that a large portion of her time became of little use, because on these days she did not dare set about any new work. And she would have
<PB REF="035296_0349_1001C290DFB30550"/>refused the best offer if made to her on a Friday, which she thought so unlucky a day that she often said what a pity it was there were any Friday in the week! Sally had twenty pounds left her by her grandmother. She had long been courted by Jacob, a sober lad, with whom she lived fellow-servant at a creditable farmer's. Honest Jacob, like his namesake of old, thought it lit∣tle to wait seven years to get this damsel to wife, be∣cause of the love he bore her, for Sally had promised to marry him when he could match her twenty pounds with another.</P>
<P>Now there was one Robert, a rambling, idle young gardener, who, instead of sitting down steadily in one place, used to roam about the country, and do odd jobs, where he could get them. No one understood any thing about him, except that he was a down-look∣ing fellow, who got his bread nobody knew how, and never had a penny in his pocket. Robert, who was now in the neighborhood, happened to hear of Sally Evans and her twenty pounds. He conceived a long∣ing desire for the latter. So he went to his old friend Rachel, told her all he had heard of Sally, and promised if she could bring about a marriage between them, she should go shares in the money.</P>
<P>Rachel undertook the business. She set off to the farm-house and fell to singing one of her most enticing songs just under the dairy window. Sally was so struck with the pretty tune, which was unhappily used to set off some very loose words, that she jumped up, dropped the skimming dish into the cream and ran out to buy the song. While she stooped down to rummage the bas∣ket for these songs which had the most tragical pictures, for Sally had a tender heart and delighted in whatever was mournful, Rachel looked stedfastly in her face, and told her she knew by her art that she was born to good fortune, but advised her not to throw herself a∣way. "These two moles on your check," added she,
<PB N="256" REF="035296_0350_1001C2929FE8D6A8"/>"shew you are in some danger." "Do they denote husbands or children?" cried Sally, starting up and letting fall the song of the children in the wood; "hus∣bands," muttered Rachel, "Alas! poor Jacob!" said Sally mournfully, "then he will die first, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t he?" "Mum for that," quoth the fortune teller, "I will say no more." Sally was impatient, but the more cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osi∣ty she discovered, the more mystery Rachel affected.— At last she said, "if you will cross my hand with a piece of silver I will tell you your fortune. By the power of my art I can do this three ways; by cards, by the lines of your hand, or by turning a cup of tea grounds: which will you have?" "O, all! all!" cried Sally, looking up with reverence to this sun-burnt oracle of wisdom, who knew no less than three different ways of diving into the secrets of futurity. Alas! persons of better sense than Sally have been so taken in; the more is the pity! The poor girl said she would run up stairs to her little box where she kept her money tied up in a bit of an old glove, and would bring down a bright queen Ann's six-pence very crooked. "I am sure," ad∣ded she, "it is a lucky one, for it cured me of a very bad ague last spring, by only laying it nine nights un∣der my pillow without speaking a word. But then you must know what gave the virtue to this six-pence was, that it had belonged to three young men of the name of John; I am sure I had work enough to get it. But true it is, it certainly cured me. It must be the six∣pence you know, for I am sure I did nothing else for my ague, except indeed taking some bitter stuff every three hours, which the doctor called bark. Indeed I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my ague soon after I took it, but I am sure it was owing to the crooked six-pence, and not to the bark. And so, good woman, you may come in if you will for there is not a soul in the house but me." This was the very thing which Rachel wanted to know.</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le Sally was above stairs untying her glove, Ra∣chel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sipped into the parlor, took a small sil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er cup from
<PB N="257" REF="035296_0351_1001C299C87089A8"/>the beaufet, and clapped it into her pocket. Sally ran down lamenting she had lost her six-pence, which she verily believed was owing to her having put it into a left glove instead of a right one. Rachel comforted her by saying, that if she gave her two plain ones in∣stead, the charm would work just as well. Simple Sal∣ly thought herself happy to be let off so easily, never calculating that a smooth shilling was worth two crook∣ed six-pences. But this skill was a part of the black art in which Rachel excelled. She took the money and began to examine the lines of Sally's left hand. She bit her withered lip, shook her head, and bade her poor dupe beware of a young man, who had black hair.—"No ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed," cried Sally, all in a fright, "you mean black eyes, for our Jacob has got brown hair, 'tis his eyes that are black." "That is the very thing I was going to say," muttered Rachel, "I meant eyes though I said hair, for I know his hair is as brown as a ches∣nut, and his eyes are as black as a sloe." "So they are, sure enough," cried Sally, "how in the world could you know that?" forgetting that she herself had just told her so. And it is thus that these hags pick out of the credulous all which they afterwards pretend to reveal to them. "O, I know a pretty deal more than that," said Rachel, but you must be aware of this man. "Why so," cried Sally with great quickness. "Because," answered Rachel, "you are fated to marry a man worth a hun∣dred of him, who has blue eyes, light hair, and a stoop in the shoulders." "No, indeed, but I can't," said Sally, "I have promised Jacob, and Jacob I will mar∣ry." "You cannot child," returned Rachel, in a so∣lemn tone; "it is out of your power; you are fated to marry the grey eyes and light hair." "Nay, indeed," said. Sally, sighing deeply, "if I am fated, I must; I know there is no resisting one's fate." This is a com∣mon cant with poor deluded girls, who are not aware that they themselves make their fate by their folly, and
<PB N="258" REF="035296_0352_1001C29F1D36FD18"/>then complain there is no resisting it. "What can I do?" said Sally. "I will tell you that too," said Ra∣chel. "You must take a walk next Sunday afternoon to the church-yard, and the first man you meet in a blue coat, with a large posy of pinks and southernwood in his bosom, sitting on the church-yard wall, about seven o'clock, he will be the man." "Provided," said Sally, much disturbed, "that he has grey eyes, and stoops." "O, to be sure," said Rachel, "otherwise it is not the right man." "But if I should mistake," said Sally, "for two men may happen to have a coat and eyes of the same color?" "To prevent that," re∣plied Rachel, "if it is the right man the two first let∣ters of his name will be R. P. This man has got mo∣ney beyond sea." "O I do not value his money," said Sally, with tears in her eyes, "for I love Jacob better than house or land; but if I am fated to marry another, I can't help it. You know there is no struggling a∣gainst my fate."</P>
<P>Poor Sally thought of nothing, and dreamt of noth∣ing all the week but the blue coat and the grey eyes.—She made a hundred blunders at her work. She put her rennet into the butter-pan, instead of the cheese tub.—She gave the curd to the hog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and put the whey into the vats. She put her little knife out of her pocket for fear it should cut love, and would not stay in the kit∣chen, if there was not an even number of people, lest it should break the charm. She grew cold and mysterious in her behavior to faithful Jacob, whom she truly lov∣ed. But the more she thought of the fortune-teller, the more she was convinced that brown hair and black eyes were not what she was fated to marry, and there∣fore though she trembled to think it, Jacob could not be the man.</P>
<P>On Sunday she was too uneasy to go to church; for poor Sally had never been taught that her being unea∣sy was only a fresh reason why she ought to go thither.
<PB N="259" REF="035296_0353_1001C2A304DE7D90"/>She spent the whole afternoon in her little garret, dres∣sing in all her best. First she put on her red ribbon, which she had bought at last Lammas fair; then she re∣collected that red was an unlucky color, and changed it for a blue ribbon, tied in a true lover's knot; but suddenly calling to mind that poor Jacob had bought this knot for her of a pedlar at the door, and that she had promised to wear it for his sake, her heart smote her, and she laid it by, sighing to think she was not fated to marry the man who had given it to her. When she had looked at herself twenty times in the glass, for one vain action always brings on another, she set off, trembling and quaking every step she went. She walk∣ed eagerly towards the church-yard, not daring to look to the right or left, for fear she should spy Jacob, who would have offered to walk with her. As soon as she came within fight of the wall, she spied a man sitting upon it. Her heart beat violently. She looked again; but alas! the stranger not only had on a black coat, but neither hair nor eyes answered the description. She happened to cast her eyes on the church-clock, and found she was two hours before her time. This was some comfort. She walked away and got rid of the two hours as well as she could, paying great attention as she went not to walk over any straws which lay across. While the clock was striking seven she returned to the church-yard, and, O! the wonderful power of fortune tellers! there she saw him! there sat the very man! his hair as light as flux, his eyes as blue as buttermilk, and his shoulders as round as a tub. Every tittle agreed to the very nosegay in his waistcoat button-hole. At first indeed she thought it had been sweethrier, and glad to catch at a straw, whispered to herself, it is not he, and I shall marry Jacob still; but on looking again she saw it was southernwood plain enough, and that all was over. The man accosted her with some very non∣sentical, but too acceptable compliments. Sally was
<PB N="260" REF="035296_0354_1001C2A9B8D1F988"/>naturally a modest girl, and but for Rachel's wicked arts, would not have talked with a strange man; but how could she resist her fate you know? After a little discourse, she asked him, with a trembling heart, what might be his name? "Robert Price, at your service," was the answer. "Robert Price! that is R. P. as sure as I am alive, and the fortune-teller was a witch! It is all out! it is all out! O the wonderful art of fortune-tellers!"</P>
<P>The little sleep she had that night was disturbed with dreams of graves, and ghosts, and funerals; but as they were morning dreams, she knew those always went by contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, and that a funeral denoted a wedding.—Still a sigh would now and then heave, to think that in that wedding Jacob could have no part. Such of my readers as know the power which superstition has over the weak and credulous mind, scarcely need be told, that poor Sally's unhappiness was soon compleated.—She forgot all her vows to Jacob; she at once forsook an honest man whom she loved, and consented to mar∣ry one of whom she knew nothing, from a ridiculous notion that she was compelled to do so by a decree which she had it not in her power to resist. She married this Robert Price, the strange gardener, whom she soon found to be very worthless, and very much in debt.—He had no such thing as "money beyond sea," as the fortune-teller had told her; but he had another wife there. He got immediate possessien of Sally's 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Ra∣chel put in for her share, but he refused to give her a farthing, and bid her get away or he would have her taken up on the vagrant act. He soon ran away from Sally, leaving her to bewail her own weakness; for it was that indeed, and not any irresistible fate which had been the cause of her ruin. To compleat her misery, she herself was suspected of having stolen the silver cup which Rachel had pocketed. Her master, however, would not prosecute her, as she was falling into a deep
<PB N="261" REF="035296_0355_1001C2AFA62A8DB8"/>decline, and she died in a few months of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Rachel, whenever she got near home, used to drop her trade of fortune-teller, and only dealt in the wares of her basket. Mr. Wilson, the clergyman, found her one day dealing out some very wicked ballads to some children. He went up with a view to give her a repri∣mand; but had no sooner begun his exhortation than up came a constable, followed by several people.—"Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> she is, that is she, that is the old witch who tricked my wife out of the five guineas," said one of them. "Do your office constable, seize that old hag. She may tell fortunes and find pots of gold in Taunton gaol, for there she will have nothing else to do." This was that very farmer Jenkins, whose wife had been cheated by Rachel of the five guineas. He had taken pains to trace her to her own parish: he did not so much value the loss of the money, but he thought it was a duty he owed the public to clear the country of such vermin. Mr. Wilson immediately committed her. She took her trial at the next assizes, when she was sentenced to a year's imprisonment. In the mean time the pawn∣broker, to whom she had sold the cup, which she had stolen from poor Sally's master, impeached, and as the robbery was sully proved upon Rachel, she was sen∣tenced for this crime to Botany Bay; and a happy day it was for the county of Somerset, when such a nui∣sance was sent out of it. She was transported much a∣bout the same time that her husband Giles lost his life in stealing the net from the garden wall.</P>
<P>I have thought it my duty to print this little history as a kind warning to all you young men and maidens not to have any thing to say to cheats, impostors, cun∣ning women, fortune-tellers, conjurers, and interpre∣ters of dreams. Listen to me, your true friend, when I assure you that God never reveals to weak and wick∣ed women those secret designs of his providence, which no human wisdom is able to foresee. To consult these
<PB N="262" REF="035296_0356_1001C2B8F83B7648"/>false oracles is not only foolish, but sinful. It is foolish, because they are themselves as ignorant as those whom they pretend to teach, and it is sinful, because it is pry∣ing into that futurity which God, as kindly as wifely, hides from men. God indeed orders all things; but when you have a mind to do a foolish thing, do not fan∣cy you are fated to do it. This is tempting providence, and not trusting him. It is indeed <HI>charging God with folly.</HI> Prudence is his gift, and you obey him better when you make use of prudence under the direction of prayer, than when you madly run into ruin, and think you are only submitting to your fate. Never fancy that you are compelled to undo yourself. Never believe that God conceals his will from a sober christian who obeys his laws, and reveals it to a vagabond gipsey, who runs up and down, breaking the laws, both of God and man. King Saul never consulted the witch till he had left off serving God. The bible will direct us what to do bet∣ter than any conjurer, and no days are unlucky but those which we make so by our own vanity, folly, and sin.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXPLANATION OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>WE all of us are taught to say the ten command∣ments, but there are few of us I am afraid who
<PB N="263" REF="035296_0357_1001C2BADB61D788"/>rightly understand them, and fewer still who walk by them and try to practise them. I may add that there are none who do not break, more or less, one or other of the ten, and that therefore there is no man living who could bear to be judged by them.</P>
<P>We read in the 20th chapter of Exodus (from whence the commandments are taken) that God spake all these words, saying, <HI>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage.</HI> God was here speaking to the Jews, who were of old his favorite people. The ten commandments were first given to them, and through them to us. We must not wonder, therefore, if we find a few expressions which mited the Jews better than they will suit us.—Let us now proceed to the explanation.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>FIRST COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</HEAD>
<P>This means that we must have, or chuse to ourselves, the one true and only God of the Scriptures. Now in order to know who this God of the Scriptures is, it is plain that we must read the Scriptures, and especially the New Testament. He was the God who appeared to Moses, at Mount Sinai, and gave him all these com∣mandments. He was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets and holy men that lived on the earth. He afterwards was still more plainly made known as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ whom he sent into the world to die for our sins, and he now sends his holy spirit into the hearts of those who call upon him. It would take too much time to enter here fully into the character of God; let us therefore only repeat shortly a few of the many things which the Scriptures have said concerning him. He is <HI>the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity. From ev∣erlasting to everlasting he is God.</HI> He is the <HI>Almighty. His wisdom is infinite: the light and the darkness are
<PB N="264" REF="035296_0358_1001C2C146D659D8"/>both alike to him. He searcheth the hearts of all the children of men. By him actions are weighed</HI>—yea, he <HI>judgeth the secrets of men's hearts. Our God shall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good or whe∣ther it be evil,</HI> for <HI>he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;</HI> and <HI>then the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> He is at the fame time a God of compassion and of tender mercy. What can more strongly prove it than his sending Christ to die for us, and to offer salvation to us. <HI>God is love. Not that we loved him,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.</HI> He described himself to Moses as being <HI>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and of great goodness, keeping mercy for thousands;</HI> yet at the same time he will by no means excuse or clear the unrepenting and the guilty. Moreover let us remark that he is the God of nature and providence; he made the world and he now governs it. <HI>Not a sparrow falls to the ground without his no∣tice.</HI> He orders the events of nations and of individu∣als. He doth all things both in heaven above and in earth below, <HI>according to the council of his own will,</HI> being righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, let us seriously apply this subject to ourselves, and first as to our knowledge of God.— Is it then in the God of the Scriptures that we believe, or in some false kind of Supreme Being whose charac∣ter is more suited to our inclinations, and more indul∣gent to our sins? Do we believe in a God who will inflict punishment on the disobedient, as well as shew mercy to them that love him and keep his command∣ments—who on the one hand is ready to pardon, and <HI>willeth all men to be saved,</HI> and who on the other will surely condemn <HI>the unbelieving,</HI> as well as <HI>plentifully
<PB N="265" REF="035296_0359_1001C2C3B2F9BA78"/>reward every wicked doer?</HI> Oh! how do men often mistake the whole character of God; some in one way some in another, according to their various tempers, passions, interests, prejudices, and conceits.</P>
<P>But having learned to know God aright, do we in the next place also reverence him, and fear him, and trust him, and love him and serve him? Do we carry about with us at all times, a holy reverence and regard to God? And as to our fear of God, I would ask, is it greater in us than our fear of man? When men re∣quire or expect us to do a thing which God has com∣manded us not to do, whom do we obey, God or man? that is the question. In vain do we flatter ourselves that we keep the first commandment if the fear of man is greater in us than that of God. Do we trust him al∣so? Do we trust him, for instance, both in our prospe∣rity and in our adversity, and whatever befals us do we say that it is the Lord who hath done it, looking for∣ward at the fame time to his help in all the future cir∣cumstances of our lives; or are we trusting in ourselves and in an arm of flesh?</P>
<P>And here, above all, let us examine whether we love God: Do we love him as our Saviour, in speaking of this commandment, expressly says that we ought to do. I mean, do we love him <HI>with all our heart, and soul, and strength:</HI> Do we love him more than we love our wealth, our pleasure, our interests, our earthly friends, or any worldly things whatever? <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</HI> said the pious psalmist, <HI>and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee.</HI> Do our hearts cleave to God as our best and most desirable portion? Is his favor all in all with us, and do we therefore seek it carnestly by prayer, and by all the means through which the Scriptures teach us that it is to be ob∣tained? And to crown all, do we obey him and dili∣gently serve him? <HI>If ye love me,</HI> said Christ, <HI>keep my commandments</HI> When we say that we love a person, and
<PB N="266" REF="035296_0360_1001C2C6B5690110"/>yet refuse to do the things he desires us, it is loving him in word only, not in deed, or in truth. Nor is it one commandment only that we must obey. If a man <HI>keepeth the commandments of God, and yet offendeth in one point, he is guilty of all;</HI> for the same God that saith, <HI>thou shalt not commit adultery,</HI> said also <HI>thou shalt not steal.</HI> Nothing more plainly proves men to be hol∣low and insincere in their whole religion than their pro∣fessing to serve God indeed in some things, but refusing to do it in others. Such men do not truly serve God at all.</P>
<P>Such is the first commandment. It says, <HI>thou shalt have none other Gods but me:</HI> that is, thou shalt set up no God in opposition to me, neither thy lusts nor thy passions, neither the world nor the flesh, nor yet any of the false Gods whom men's own imaginations have formed to themselves, nor whom the heathen fall down and worship.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>SECOND COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me: and shew mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</HEAD>
<P>This commandment was directed more particularly to the Jews. God had separated them from the sur∣rounding nations, who were idolatrous, and had made a covenant with them, that they should not make to them∣selves Gods, such as their neighbors worshipped, but that he should be their God, and they should be his people. He says in this commandment, that he is a jealous God, that is, jealous of his honor. It is said in
<PB N="267" REF="035296_0361_1001C2CE63876DB0"/>another place, <HI>my glory will I not give to another, nei∣ther my praise to graven images.</HI> He will have no ri∣vals in any respect. The declaration, that he would visit the sins of the fathers upon the children even to the third and fourth generation, is to be understood as a part of that national covenant which God made with the Jews. If the fathers worshipped and served him, then the children also would continue to have him in like manner, for their God: but if the fathers went a∣stray, and did as the heathen, then also the children for generation after generation were to be involved in the consequences. Somewhat in like manner indeed it of∣ten happens now, that children suffer through the crimes of their parents, which should be an argument with all parents both to avoid sinning themselves, and to take care lest they draw their children into sin and misery also.</P>
<P>Let us then abhor this sin of idolatry. It was one into which the Jews were continually falling; and let it be our prayer, as well as our endeavor, that all the nations of the earth, who are now sunk in idolatry, may be recovered out of it; for it is a sin highly offen∣sive to God.</P>
<P>Let us ourselves keep at the greatest distance from this sin, and for this purpose it seems prudent not even to adorn our churches with images, lest any of the peo∣ple who see them there, forgetting that God is a spirit, should pay undue honor to the representation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>THIRD COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who ta∣keth his name in vain.</HEAD>
<P>To take the name of God in vain is, in the strong∣est and worst sense of the words, to call on God to witness a thing that is false, or in other words, to take a false oath. In many cases men are required by law to
<PB N="268" REF="035296_0362_1001C2D4130F6118"/>make oath of the truth of what they say. Now what solemnity and fear of God should there be in our minds on such occasions! The judge and the jury indeed may possibly not find us out, but <HI>the Lord our God will not hold us guiltless if we thus dreadfully take his name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>We may here remark by the way, that it is this fear of God therefore, which is the chief security of the lives and properties of people in society. Now I think it cannot be too strongly insisted on, that it is a very so∣lemn thing to call on God to witness any thing we are at but to utter, and that therefore, all restlessness and in consideration in taking eaths, even though the oaths should not be false, are very sinful. There are some who take custom-house oaths in a very slovenly manner, and who say, "O it is only a custom-house oath."— Others take oaths of office just as lightly, and I believe there are some who now and then take oaths of a grave and solemn nature in their pastimes and in mere sport. But let all such weigh well those awful words, <HI>the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The next practice we shall speak of is that of com∣mon swearing, a sin which has not the excuse which most other sins have, of some present pleasure or profit having tempted the person to it. That awful name which angels reverence and adore, and which all good men cannot hear without a peculiar emotion, is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fied with, and in that sense, taken in vain by a great part of our fellow-creatures almost every hour of every day.— Some add cursing to this profane mention of the name of God, and often of the most horrid kind, and, per∣haps, when they curse and swear, do not know that they me doing it, which they think is an excuse, but which ought other to be considered as a proof to what an awful pass the habit has gone. Others, equally without knowing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, use the name of God to express
<PB N="269" REF="035296_0363_1001C2D678C26158"/>their surprise, or to make their conversation, as they think, more entertaining. Ah! how dreadful will it be for such persons to have all these words brought a∣gainst them, as so many unexpected sins, on the day of judgment.</P>
<P>But it is necessary to be still more plain and particu∣lar on this head, for the very persons who are most guilty of this sin oftentimes cannot, or will not under∣stand that what is said is addressed personally to them. To prove the justice of what we are about to add, I would here first call to my render's recollection what our Saviour himself has observed on the subject of this commandment. <HI>Ye have heard,</HI> said he, <HI>how it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not for swear thyself, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; but I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his foot∣stool.</HI> To say by heavens, or good heavens (the very expression which some people use now) is thus express∣ly forbid by our Saviour. But not only this one phrase which happened to be the one in common use in Christ's time, but all others of a like kind are of course by the same precept forbidden. It is painful to mention the various ways of being profane, which irreligious men from time to time have invented; but for the sake of being understood, it seems necessary here in some de∣gree to do so. I would observe therefore, that such phrases as the following: "Bless me," meaning Lord bless me, "Mercy on me," meaning Lord have mercy on me, "By Jove," meaning by the heathen God Jove or Jupiter, "Upon my soul," "Faith," and a variety of others appear all to be forbidden. <HI>Let your communication,</HI> says Christ, <HI>be yea, yea, nay, nay,</HI> that is, let your assertions be plain and simple, and not pro∣fane or violent. Let them consist as much as possible in a simple yes and no; <HI>for whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil.</HI> Sin begins whenever we depart
<PB N="270" REF="035296_0364_1001C2D824C09D78"/>from this simplicity and purity of speech, and it seems even to be declared, that all those profane expressions which our Saviour alludes to, come from the wicked one.</P>
<P>We will close this subject with two remarks—the first is, beware of all violence and passion. Men swear often through passion. To cure men's passion is there∣fore to take away one cause of their swearing; nay, re∣member also that even all violent affirmations, all ap∣peals to God or to religion which are needless, are of∣fences against our Saviour's rule. It is a rule which calls us all to peculiar simplicity and self-command, in our conversation. Be calm, therefore; be not loud and boisterous, but mild and gentle in your speech, and in order to keep your tongue, learn also to keep your heart.—Learn, therefore, in short, those doctrines of the gospel which go to the correction of the heart.</P>
<P>My last observation is, be serious. The world is full of people, who in one way or other are taking God's name in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and who do it, as was observed before, with∣out thinking of it; and the reason of it is, they are not serious. They have no awe of the divine majesty, or of the divine presence. They have not felt the power of religion in their hearts. They have no reverence for God and divine things, and hence it is that they speak so lightly of them. In vain do we multiply di∣rections, not to use this or the other word, because it is profane; a profane mind will be ever coining new words instead of the old ones which are forbidden, and will betray a person into profaneness a hundred times a day without his being once a ware of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</HI> Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day. Sin days shalt thou labor, and do all that thou hast to do.—But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt do no manner of work, thou, nor
<PB N="271" REF="035296_0365_1001A3CF2E451BA8"/>thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, thy maid∣servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wed it.</HEAD>
<P>In the New Testament we find our Saviour observing that <HI>the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,</HI> that is, the Sabbath was made to be a benefit to man, and not a burthen to him. We who are christians should peculiarly rejoice in it as a bene∣fit. What a blessing is it, in particular to the poor of this country, that there is one day in seven on which they may rest from their work, and pass the day with their families in worshipping and praising God, and in considering over all his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcies, as well as in exac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in∣ing into the manner in which they have been perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n∣ing their own weekly duties. The very brutes, in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, share in the benefit, for this commandment mercifully provides a day of rest for the ox and the ass also.</P>
<P>It is proper here to remark, that some alteration has taken place in respect to the Sabbath, since this com∣mandment was given. The day has been changed, for we keep now not the seventh day of the week, which is Saturday, but the first, which is Sunday, because our Lord rose from the dead on the Sunday, and the name of the <HI>Lord's day</HI> has for that reason been given to it. We therefore unite two purposes together, for we both rest every seventh day as the Jews did, in im∣itation of God, who made the world in six days, and then rested or ceased from his work on the seventh, and we also commemorate the glorious resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who, as on this day was raised from the dead, after having died for our sins and obtained eternal redemption for us.</P>
<P>Besides the difference in the day it is natural that there should now arise some circumstances of difference
<PB N="272" REF="035296_0366_1001C2E18DCBDC40"/>in the manner of keeping Sunday. The Jews, who often indeed misinterpreted their own law, thought it wrong to pluck so much as an ear of corn, or to heal a person of his disease on the Sabbath day, and in many other points they were extremely strict. But we have been taught by our Saviour, that this commandment ought not to be construed so severely by us, and it is now generally agreed among the most serious chris∣tians, that both works of mercy, and also works of ne∣cessity are perfectly lawful on the Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>But let us next endeavor to explain distinctly in what manner it seems to us that a christian Sabbath ought, under our present circumstances, to be kept.</P>
<P>And first, it should be considered by us as a day of rest from our common labor. The very laws of the land require this, by forbidding shops to be opened, and common employments to be followed on the Lord's day, and all magistrates are obliged by their oath, to see the laws of their country executed in this respect. Eve∣ry individual therefore is bound to abstain from the open violation of the Sabbath provided he reverences the laws or the public religion of his country, even supposing that he is not a christian himself.</P>
<P>But christians are called upon to keep the Sabbath holy in a much higher sense. The word holy means separate or setapart from others, in order to a religious use. We should therefore consider the Sabbath as a different day from other days, and should carry that feeling habitually about with us through all the hours of it. Even if necessity should oblige us to do some things which make a part of our common work, yet even then we should endeavor to bear in our minds all the while that it is the Sabbath. I urge this learing in mind that it is the Sabbath, because I know that if this sentiment is in the heart needless work will be generally avoided, but that without this a man will not easly be kept from breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Sabbath in one way or other.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="035296_0367_1001C2E62B5F8FB8"/>
Remember then that all common work, which can as well be shifted to the Saturday or the Monday, be∣comes sinful if done on the Sunday. Cleanliness must no doubt be attended to on the Sunday, but this is to be done by the preparation of Saturday. Our food must be got ready; but this may be managed with very little trouble even in the largest families, if there is but a dis∣position to spare all kinds of labor on the Sabbath-day. There are many houses, I grant, which must not be less quite empty during civine service; but it is in ge∣noral enough if one person is lest at home, who may take turns with others, so that the fan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e individual need not always be hindered from attending public worship. There should be an universal agreement among mas∣ters and servants, and among servants also with one another, each not only to observe the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbath himself, but to promote the observation of it among those around him.</P>
<P>But now, to speak of what is still more material.—It It is of little use to abstain from bodily work, if the frame of mind is quite inconsistent with a due attention to the Sabbath. This would be a formal and Jewish Sab∣bath indeed. To comply with the form, but to ne∣glect the spirit, is no true keeping of the christian Sab∣bath. It should even be remembered that if Jewish forms are in some respects left off, it becomes us to be the more careful to attend to the substance; for we are now placed under a dispensation, in which all is expect∣ed to be <HI>spirit and life.</HI></P>
<P>The Sabbath, as was observed before, was made for man. It was made for his good, and more especially for his spiritual good. Whatever therefore tends to our spiritual benefit is fit employment for the Sabbath. Public worship has been appointed on this principle, in all christian countries. But it is necessary that we should not only be seen attending in our places, but that our minds also should be engaged in the service. In
<PB N="274" REF="035296_0368_1001C2EBE3B5FF90"/>prayer we should feel our need of the mercies we im∣plore; in the confession of sin, we should be affected with a sense of our unworthiness, and in offering up our thanksgivings to God, we should pour out our whole hearts before him. And when we hear the Scrip∣tures read, and the gospel of Jesus Christ preached to us, we should listen with an attentive ear, and receive the truth into an honest and good heart. When we are returning from the service, we should not discourse as many are apt to do, about light and trifling things; but we should call up the subject which we may have been hearing of at church. We should betake ourselves also at home to the instruction of our children, to the reading of the Scriptures, to family prayers, and to con∣versation that may have something useful in it, or if we take our walk abroad, it should be in order to indulge in meditation on divine things, and in order also to call perhaps on our more pious friends and kindred, whose conversation is likely to turn on topics suitable to the day, or to visit the sick, to comfort one that is afflicted, to do an act of kindness and charity, or to pursue some plan of usefulness proper for the Sabbath, and in which we may be then regularly employed.</P>
<P>Such are the occup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions which become a christian on the Sunday, and uniting, as they naturally do, with the exercise of the social affections, they may well employ the whole of this sacred season; for that is a poor motley inconsistent Sabbath indeed of which one little part on∣ly is spent at church, <HI>in building ourselves up in our most holy faith,</HI> while the rest is given up to such em∣ployments as tend to pull down what we have been building up, and to promote forgetfulness of all that we have been hearing. It is the prayer before we go to worship, and the reflection after; it is the weekly self-examination which we at this time practise; it is the secret desires of the heart after the favor of God; it is the humble and holy contemplation of the life,
<PB N="275" REF="035296_0369_1001C2F40DEB85B8"/>death, and resurrection, and ascension of our Saviour; it is, in short, the heavenly mind exercising itself on spiritual objects, and shutting out those things that are worldly, which constitutes the true keeping of the Sab∣bath. It is thus that we acquire a <HI>hope full of immor∣tality.</HI> "All sorrows mitigated, all cares suspended, all fears repressed, every angry emotion softened, eve∣ry envious, revengeful, or malignant passion expelled:" we become on this day partakers, in some measure, of the heavenly happiness, and learn to look forward to that never ending Sabbath, to that season of eternal <HI>rest which remaineth for the people of God.</HI></P>
<P>And now what a privilege is the Sabbath! It is of∣ten so spoken of in the Old Testament. <HI>I gave you my Sabbaths,</HI> says God to the Israelites, and then he proceeds to found a claim upon that nation for peculiar gratitude and obedience. Let us be grateful to God that he hath by his good providence, preserved to us this blessed day, while, in many countries in Europe it has been grievously profaned, and in some entirely overthrown. Let us rejoice that in Great Britain the law of the land still in some measure maintains it, tho' many of the people are learning to confound it more and more with the other days of the week, and are thus impiously casting off all concern for this command∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>EXPLANATION OF THE NATURE OF BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Designed espe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ally for all those Parents who are abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to bring a Child to be baptized.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sacrament of Baptism, like that of the Lord's Supper, was appointed by Jesus Christ himself and no doubt for the wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st purposes. It is a mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whereby we may acquire no small insight into the na∣ture of the whole christian religion. Unhappily, how∣ever, there is a remarkable degree of carelessness and ignorance about this subject pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varling among us, in∣somuch, that it some pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns are not taken to represent this important matter aright to our countrymen in ge∣neral, and to all parents in particular, we seem in dan∣ger of losing all the benefit which was intended to be conveved to us by this institution of Christ. It is true the form of Baptism is still continued among us. Pa∣rents appear, almost with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e consent, to bring their children to be baptized; but for what purpose do they bring them? Is it because they really wish to pledge their children, and to pledge themselves afresh, to fight under the banners of Christ? Oh, no; for there are many who hardly once think of Christ in the matter. I appeal to the common observation of my readers, whe∣ther the day of baptizing a child is not by many parents made to be little else than a day of extraordinary feast∣ing, a day of vanity and ostentation, a day at least of n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re worldly joy, on which, when the clergyman ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="277" REF="035296_0371_1001C2FB3763E6B0"/>done his office, not a word is to be heard of that <HI>king∣dom of heaven</HI> whereof the child is now said to be a <HI>par∣taker,</HI> nor of those holy ends for the sake of which baptism was appointed by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Godfathers and godmothers also have learnt, as well as parents, to be very inconsiderate about this sacred ordinance. They promise, indeed, in the face of God and of the church, <HI>to renounce,</HI> in the child's name, <HI>this wicked world, with all the sinful lusts of the flesh,</HI> and they also are understood expressly to undertake that the child shall be taught not only <HI>the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments,</HI> but also, <HI>all oth∣er things which a christian ought to know and believe for his soul's health;</HI> and yet the most of them have no sooner made this vow than they think they have done with it; they reflect not whether the parent be a per∣son who is likely to pay that attention to the child's soul for which they have been engaging, nor do they ever afterwards bestow a single thought on its religious education themselves.</P>
<P>Some there are, indeed, who do not act quite so ab∣surdly about baptism, nor think quite so lightly of it as many others, and yet are far from turning it to a truly religious use; they are aware, in part, of the profana∣tion of it which is so common, but they have not the courage to differ from the general custom. They dare not refuse, for instance, to stand godfather or godmo∣ther whensoever some one expects or requests it of them. To do so is a bad custom, they allow, but since it is a custom they must comply with it. Ah, how little do they reflect, that in that very vow which in the child's name they are about to take, there is contained a pro∣mise <HI>to renounce the world;</HI> in which promise the re∣nunciation of its sinful customs is no doubt included; and I therefore ask such persons, whether the custom of undertaking, lightly, the duty of godfathers and godmo∣thers,
<PB N="278" REF="035296_0372_1001C2FE48115690"/>is not one of those sinful customs which the very ceremony of baptism pledges them to renounce.</P>
<P>In short, then it must be acknowledged, that baptism is on all sides neglected and profaned, and that it is be∣come now little, else than a convenient ceremony, by which people bestow a name upon their children.</P>
<P>But is this all that was intended by it? It surely needs no argument to prove, that it was never meant by the founder of it to serve merely as a national cere∣mony, by which we were to register ages, or to give names to our children. It cannot be that a Sacrament ordained by him who died for us, enjoined upon his disciples nearly in his last words, and emphatically ur∣ged upon us in those remarkable expressions, <HI>he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.</HI> I say, it can∣not be that a Sacrament thus solemnly appointed can deserve to be lightly treated. Depend upon it, it can∣not be made light of without affronting him who was the founder of it. It cannot be made light of without making light of Christ; without making light of him who is the hope of fallen man, and the only Saviour of our souls.</P>
<P>Let us then proceed reverently to enquire what is the true meaning and nature of it.</P>
<P>And here I would first remark, that long before baptism was appointed there prevailed among the Jews the ceremony of circumcision, which had nearly the same use and design. Abraham was the first person on whom circumcision was enjoined. Abraham was cal∣led by the divine goodness from a state of ignorance and idolatry, he was blessed also with many great and glorious promises; he was made the father of the faith∣ful, and was himself adopted into the family of God; in token whereof circumcision was required of him as a sign, the same thing being required also of his children the Jews, who became the peculiar people of God; not that the mere sign or ceremony could bring any one
<PB N="279" REF="035296_0373_1001C300112F5E48"/>into God's favor, for the apostles tell the Jews, that if they did not also <HI>keep the law, verily their circumci∣sion was made uncircumcision.</HI> And again it is said, <HI>for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</HI> The being <HI>a new creature</HI> was therefore the great point: and cir∣cumcision seems to have been intended to represent to men in those early ages, that new and holy state into which they must be brought in order to their being in∣troduced into the favor of God, uncircumcision repre∣senting on the other hand that sinful condition in which we are born, and in which we all naturally are, accord∣ing to that expression of the apostle, <HI>and you who were dead in your sins, and in the uncircumcision of your flesh yet now hath he reconciled.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus made it appear what circumcision meant of old, let us next shew from the same word of God what baptism signifies now.</P>
<P>When Nicodemus came to Jesus by night in order to enquire (as it seems) into the nature of that new re∣ligion of which he had heard, Jesus says to him, <HI>verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</HI> Nicodemus not under∣standing what was spoken, our Saviour declares again, <HI>except a man be born of water and of the spirit he can∣not see the kingdom of God.</HI> What is it to be born of water and the spirit? The answer I think will be found easy, especially if we take advantage of the information given us in other parts of Scripture. Water, we there find, is the sign ordered to be used in baptism on ac∣count of its cleansing whatever is dirty or defiled; the holy spirit however is the thing signified by the water; for as it is the business of water to cleanse the defile∣ment of the body, so it is the office of the Holy Spirit to cleanse the corruption of the heart of man. The mean∣ing, therefore, of our Saviour's speech to Nicodemus
<PB N="280" REF="035296_0374_1001C307458446F8"/>seems to be as follows, "Except a man be renewed, or born again, and not by the outward baptism of water only, but also by the effectual inward baptism or puri∣fication of the Holy Spirit—<HI>except a man be</HI> thus <HI>born, both of water and of the spirit,</HI> he cannot see (that is, he cannot rightly understand, nor is he qualified to en∣ter into) the kingdom of God. <HI>Blessed,</HI> says our Sa∣viour, <HI>are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</HI> It is our hearts then, and not our bodies only, that must be baptized and purified. We are naturally corrupt, indisposed to serve God, and to obey his will and com∣mandments. <HI>We are all,</HI> says Scripture, <HI>gone out of the way. Behold,</HI> says David, <HI>I was born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. And you,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world—and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.</HI>—We are therefore exhorted not to be conformed to this present world, but to be transformed in the renewing of our minds. And the Scripture accordingly speaks of true christians as <HI>being cleansed by the washing of re∣generation and renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> and of their being <HI>washed and cleansed, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> The necessity then of his death unto sin and new birth unto righteousness is plain and evident; for how can an unholy creature obtain the favor of a holy God, and become fitted for a holy heaven, without undergoing this change so just, so rational is that saying of our Saviour, <HI>ye must be born again.</HI></P>
<P>There are many other passages of Scripture which equally shew that to be a christian is to undergo a great change in the natural disposition of our minds, and al∣so that baptism is intended to set forth to us this change. <HI>As many of you,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ;</HI> that is, ye have put on
<PB N="281" REF="035296_0375_1001C30B8656DD20"/>the same dispositions that were in your Saviour, such as his humility, meekness, love to God and man, devo∣tion, heavenly-mindedness; and again, <HI>for we are bu∣ried by baptism into his death, that, like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</HI> When Paul himself first became a christian, Ananias said to him, <HI>arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins.</HI> Ana∣nias does not merely say, <HI>arise and be baptized.</HI> No, these words are introductory to the words that follow. And so is it in our case. <HI>Wash away thy sins,</HI> is an addition which we also must make to our form of bap∣tism. Nay, I will venture to remark, that baptism without this is not only useless, but it is even worse than useless. It does but aggravate our guilt; just as in the case of any other promise, he who promises, but does not perform, not only makes his promise void, but is even in a worse case than if he had never made any promise at all.</P>
<P>The blessings of the gospel, it is true are, on that part of God, conveyed over to us in baptism, but they are conveyed over to us only on the supposition, that we also on our side repent earnestly of our sins, have faith in Christ, become regenerate, or born again, and walk in newness of life. If all these things are left undone, and are forgotten by us, our baptism is then like an a∣greement as yet unfulfilled. It is like a contract or bar∣gain, which has been made, but which one of the par∣ties has afterwards rendered void, through his having ne∣glected to fulfil something that he promised in the very body of the deed. The other party is therefore let loose of course. For let not the reader suppose that there is any charm in baptism, and that on the saying over of certain words by a regular priest, the gates of heaven fly open to him, his heart being now renewed and made regenerate of course. Let not any one, I say, presume to stake his salvation on the truth of so absurd a suppo∣sition
<PB N="282" REF="035296_0376_1001C30D397EE328"/>as this. A person is admitted, I grant, at the time of baptism into the church of Christ, but it is only into the visible church; for an outward form can only admit into the outward church; and it is also in the way of charity supposed (according to the form now in use in the church of England) that the baptized person both does and will fulfil his part, so as to avail himself of the christian privileges held out to him.</P>
<P>Let us then beware of this as well as every other er∣ror, and as the Jews were continually warned by Christ and his apostles not to trust in the form of circumcision, but to remember the thing signified, so let us take warn∣ing not to trust in the form of baptism, but to remem∣ber what baptism signifies; for <HI>he is not a Jew,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>who is one outwardly;</HI> and in like manner, he is not a christian who is one outwardly, <HI>neither is circumcision</HI> (nor baptism neither) <HI>that which is out∣ward in the flesh, but it is that of the heart and of the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of man but of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is proper that something should here be added, con∣cerning the particular expressions which our Saviour used when he appointed the ordinance of baptism. When he had now finished his work, when he had died for our sins on the cross, and had also risen again, and was about to ascend into heaven, <HI>go ye,</HI> said he to his disci∣ples, <HI>into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature! Go ye and baptize them in the name of the Fa∣ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>In the same sacred names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost (or Spirit) all christians are now bapti∣zed. Let us therefore close the present subject, by en∣deavoring to explain, in an easy and familiar manner, what it is that a true christian, who is baptized, may be supposed to mean by each of these three striking expres∣sions.</P>
<P>To be baptized into these three sacred names may
<PB N="283" REF="035296_0377_1001C30F3221D8D8"/>be considered then as saying, in the first place, "I be∣lieve in God, the Father Almighty, who made and who now governs the world, and orders all things by his continual providence." It is to say, "I believe in that God of whom the Scriptures speak, and not in those false gods which vain men have imagined to themselves, whether they be gods of wood and stone, or gods whom their own reason hath set up in opposition to the one true and only God of the Scriptures." It is to say secondly—"I believe also in Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, and who for us men and our salvation came down from heaven, who was crucified, dead, and buri∣ed, and who on the third day rose again from the dead and ascended into heaven. I renounce, therefore, the vain hope of being my own Saviour; I own my guilt and unworthiness. I trust in the merits of my Saviour's death, and in his power to save that immortal soul which I have committed to him." It is to say thirdly—"I be∣lieve also in the Holy Ghost. I believe in the miracles which he wrought in the days of the apostles, whereby he testified of Jesus Christ. I believe in him also as my sanctifier. I depend on his help for that change in my corrupt nature of which I feel the need, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd while I am striving earnestly against my sins, I implore the grace of this Holy Spirit, without which I know that I can do no∣thing." It is to say also, that "I believe in him as my comforter. I draw my best consolations not from the world, nor from the ordinary satisfactions of this life, still less from the indulgence of my pride or of my pas∣sions; but my highest comfort springs from those holy doctrines of the gospel which the Divine Spirit has, I trust, impressed on my heart; and from that humble persuasion which he hath given me, that, for the sake of Jesus Christ, God even now admits me into his fa∣vor, and will hereafter receive me into his glory.</P>
<P>Such is the true meaning of our being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
<PB N="284" REF="035296_0378_1001C316B60F7658"/>It is to renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh, so as no longer to follow nor be led by them. It is to chuse instead of these, and as it were in defiance of them, and in direct opposition to them, that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit which have been spoken of. It is to profess to live all our days in this faith, persevering in it through all the changes and chances of this mortal life, in spite of all the revolutions which may happen in the faith of our own country, or in that of surrounding nations. It is to determine to hold fast this faith, into whatsoever new place we go, and among what∣soever company we may chance to dwell, amidst the scoff of infidels, amidst the gainsaying of heretics, a∣midst all the discouragements or persecutions that may rise up against it in the world, amidst the evil example of degenerate and corrupt christians, and amidst the united enmity and opposition of all wicked men. And lastly, to take on ourselves the christian name in bap∣tism is to profess that in this faith having lived, in this faith we trust we shall not be afraid to die, since we are well persuaded that we shall not be ashamed of having confessed this faith on the great judgment day.</P>
<P>Having spoken hitherto of baptism in general, I now mean to make the following</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Address to those Parents who are about to bring a Child to be Baptized.</HEAD>
<P>A general question might indeed be asked—"But why should infants be baptized at all? Why should they be made to promise that which, on account of their tender age, they cannot perform." To this objection the church of England gives the following answer:—"Because the children promise, by means of their sure∣ties, which promise, when they come to age, they them∣selves are bound to perform." Now, I cannot help
<PB N="285" REF="035296_0379_1001C31AB3C21770"/>here remarking, that although the godfathers and god∣mothers may be the persons in this place alluded to, yet parents also must of necessity be considered as sureties, and even as principal sureties for the religious education of their children; for, not to mention the duty that ari∣ses from the very relationship between parent and child, is it not the parents who bring the child to be baptized? Does it not depend on the parents' will whether the child shall be baptized or not? The baptism of the child being then the parents' act, the parents certainly must be considered as approving of the baptismal vow, and as approving it both with respect to their children and themselves also.</P>
<P>You then that are parents, and that are about to bring a child to be baptized, ask yourselves such questions as the following. First, am I serious in what I am do∣ing? Baptism you have just seen is a solemn thing.—It is not that light matter which some people make of it. Indeed, the manner in which parents are used to bring their children to be baptized, may serve as a test or proof by which we may try the reality of their whole religion. They who treat christian baptism lightly, we may depend upon it, are altogether light and giddy peo∣ple; nor is this all; to be light and giddy in a case of this sort, is to be profane and wicked also.</P>
<P>There is something indeed particularly aggravated in the guilt of those parents who come in a trifling spirit to attend their child's baptism. When the mother has just escaped from the pains and perils of child-birth; when the father has had the life of his beloved wife pre∣served to him, and when they both are made the hap∣py parents of a living infant, then is the time for com∣ing and offering up to God, who is the deliverer, and in the name of Christ, who is their Saviour, their deli∣cate and tender offspring. Is this then the time for light and giddy mirth? or for luxury, and vanity, and osten∣tation? or for giving way to the evil customs of an un∣thinking
<PB N="286" REF="035296_0380_1001C31F9F455F00"/>world? and above all, is this a time for pro∣faning one of the most sacred ordinances of Christ? No; it is the time rather for the parents to think of their sins, and to examine into all the errors of their own past life. And as the right education of their new-born in∣fant will now become the object of their thought, it ought certainly to occur to them, and to impress itself very strongly on their mind, that an immortal being is now committed to their care, a being whose soul is like∣ly to be saved or lost, according as it receives from them a good or a bad education, influence, and example.—To have brought an immortal being into the world is, to every considerate mind, in itself no light matter; and for the parents to be the means not of saving, but of damning the child to which they have given birth, is a thought too horrible to be borne. Many, therefore, who neglect their own souls cannot endure the idea of neglecting the souls of their children, and they are for doing something at least towards what they call, the right education of their offspring; but let all parents remember that if they are light and profane, instead of being serious and devout in presenting their child to God in baptism, the child is then introduced into life by an act which amounts to a solemn mockery of God. And alas, is there not then too much reason to fear lest (to borrow some words of the church of England service) "the child should lead the remainder of his life, but too truly, according to this beginning."</P>
<P>But now to be more particular. First, then, before the time of baptism comes, be sure that you offer up to God in secret the most fervent prayers on the behalf of your infant. What is baptism? It is a Sacrament ap∣pointed by Christ, in order to remind us that the natu∣ral hearts both of parents and children need to be bap∣tized or cleansed by God's Holy Spirit; and how is this gift of the Holy Spirit to be obtained? By prayer; for God hath said, he will give his Holy Spirit to them that
<PB N="287" REF="035296_0381_1001C321DBD15680"/>ask it. As then by prayer you are to seek this gift for yourself, so are you to seek it for your children also.—Pray then, I say, that God will give to your child <HI>that thing which by nature he cannot have;</HI> that he will en∣dow him not only with kind and amiable tempers, but also with the still greater gift of his heavenly grace.—Pray that he may not only be respectable, so as to do credit to his family, in the eyes of men, but that he may have the fear of God also in his heart. Pray that he may be established in the faith of Christ, and that he may be one of those who shall one day fight manfully under Christ's banners against Sin, the World and the Devil, and who shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified in the midst of a proud, a careless, and a wicked world.</P>
<P>Let me remark next, in respect to godfathers and godmothers, that it will be your endeavor if you are at all impressed with the important nature of baptism, to chuse them from among the most religious persons of your acquaintance, and not merely from among those who may be most likely to help foward your child in his worldly interest; for, in a case of this sort, you must cast aside the principle of worldly policy, and you may also have to act against the rules of civility, and common custom. It is probable, indeed, if you have hitherto been a thoughtless, irreligious person, that your religious friends, if you have any, will be very shy of standing godfathers or godmothers to your children. In order then to take away their objections, explain to them how seriously you now intend to bring up your offspring. Assure them that you account baptism a ve∣ry solemn thing, that you wish them to undertake for the religious education of your child on serious princi∣ples, and also that you shall be glad to take advice from them from time to time on this subject.</P>
<P>In the next place, on the day of baptism, be careful to avoid all extravagant feasting and shew, as well as
<PB N="288" REF="035296_0382_1001C32450C61910"/>levity. Do not prepare a vast expensive dinner, but a decent and moderate meal, and beware of inviting a croud of irreligious people to be your guests. Do not dress out the little infant in expensive finery, but re∣member that you are about to dedicate him to one, who, when he gave a feast to his followers, was pleased to offer them nothing but a few fishes and barley-bread, who had not himself a house where to lay his head, and who, when he was nearly of the age of your child, was laid even in a manger.</P>
<P>And when the day of baptism is over, begin imme∣diately to prepare for the good education of your child, by taking all those steps which now become you. If there is any thing in your character and conduct which will reflect blame on you in the eyes of your offspring, and thus lessen their reverence for you, endeavor to cor∣rect all such things now. Are there any wrong habits which you are living in, be sure to change them now. Have you any friends, whose principles are such as to make them dangerous companions for your child, part them from all such friends now, and begin immediately to form such connections, and to establish such religious customs in your family, as may be of serious use to your children.</P>
<P>Above all, lastly, take this occasion of examining whether you have ever yet fulfilled your own vow in baptism; for if you have not, it is in vain to expect that you will do your duty religiously by your children. Examine, then, whether the great end of baptism has been fulfilled in you; whether you have ever repented of your sins, have turned to God, have learnt to deny the sinful inclinations of your heart, have refused to fol∣low the evil customs of the world, and have become holy, as your profession of christianity requires you to be. Examine, in short, whether you have got a chris∣tian name only, or a christian nature also. If you can∣not answer these questions satisfactorily, do not run a∣way
<PB N="289" REF="035296_0383_1001C3279E6FE2A8"/>from the subject altogether, but rather take the opportunity which the affecting circumstance of a child's birth affords you of considering over all your own ways and let the season of your child's being born into a new world be the season of your own death unto sin, and new birth unto righteousness.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Servant Man turned Soldier;</HI> OR, THE FAIR WEATHER CHRISTIAN A PARABLE.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM was a lively young servant who lived in a great but very irregular family. His place was, on the whole, agreeable to him, and suited to his gay thoughtless temper. He found a plentiful table and a good cellar. There was indeed a good deal of work to be done, though it was performed with much disor∣der and confusion. The family in the main were not unkind to him, though they often contradicted and cros∣sed him, especially when things went ill with themselves. This, William never much liked, for he was always fond of having his own way. There was a merry, or rather a noisy and riotous servant's hall; for disorder and quarrels are indeed the usual effects of plenty and unrestrained indulgence. The men were smart but idle, the maids were showy, but licentious, and all did pret∣ty much as they liked for a time, but the time was com∣monly short. The wages were reckoned high, but
<PB N="290" REF="035296_0384_1001C3298B98AC78"/>they were seldom paid, and it was even said by sober people, that the master was insolvent, and never fulfil∣led any of his flattering engagements, or his most posi∣tive promises; but still, notwithstanding his real pover∣ty, things went on with just the same thoughtlessness and splendor, and neither master or servants looked be∣yond the jollity of the present hour.</P>
<P>In this unruly family there was little church-going, and still less praying at home. They pretended, indeed, in a general way, to believe in the bible, but it was on∣ly an outward profession, few of them read it at all, and even of those who did read it still fewer were governed by it. There was indeed a bible lying on the table in the great hall, which was kept for the purpose of ad∣ministering an oath, but was seldom used on any other occasion, and some of the heads of the family were of opinion that this was its only real use, as it might serve to keep the lower parts of it in order.</P>
<P>William, who was fond of novelty and pleasure, was apt to be negligent of the duties of the house. He used to stay out on his errands, and one of his favorite a∣musements was going to the parade to see the soldiers exercise. He saw with envy how smartly they were dressed, listened with rapture to the music, and fancied that a soldier had nothing to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regular order, to go through a little easy exercise, in short, to live without fighting, fatigue, or danger.</P>
<P>"Oh!" said he, whenever he was affronted at home, "what a fine thing it must be to be a soldier! to be so well dressed, to have nothing to do but to move to the pleasant sound of fife and drum, and to have so many people to come to look at one, and admire one. O it must be a fine thing to be a soldier!"</P>
<P>Yet when the vexation of the moment was over, he sound so much ease and diversion in his master's house, so suited to his low taste and sensual appetites, that he
<PB N="291" REF="035296_0385_1001C32B8DE3FFF0"/>thought no more of the matter. He forgot the glories of a soldier, and eagerly returned to all the mean gra∣tifications of the kitchen. His evil habits were but lit∣tle attended to by those with whom he lived; his faults, among which were lying and swearing, were not often corrected by the family, who had little objection to those sins which only offended God, and did not much affect their own interest or property. And except that William was obliged to work rather more than he li∣ked, he found little, while he was young and healthy, that was very disagreeable in this service. So he went on, still thinking, however, when things went a little cross, "what a fine thing it was to be a soldier!" and at last one day as he was waiting at dinner, he had the misfortune to let fall a china dish, and broke it all to pieces. It was a curious dish, much valued by the fa∣mily, as they pretended; this family were indeed apt to set a false fantastic value on things, and not to estimate them by their real worth. The heads of the family, who had generally been rather patient and good-hu∣mored with William, as I said before, for these vices, which, though offensive to God, did not touch their own pocket, now flew out into a violent passion with him, called him a thousand hard names, and even threat∣ened to horsewhip him for his shameful negligence.</P>
<P>William, in a great fright, for he was a sad coward at bottom, ran directly out of the house, to avoid the theatened punishment, and happening just at that very time to pass by the parade where the soldiers chanced to be then exercising, his resolution was taken in a mo∣ment. He instantly determined to be no more a slave, as he called it; he would return no more to be subject to the humours of a tyrannical family; no, he was re∣solved to be free, or, at least, if he must serve, he would serve no master but the King.</P>
<P>William, who had now and then happened to hear, from the accidental talk of the soldiers, that those who
<PB N="292" REF="035296_0386_1001A38FDEB63690"/>served the <HI>great family</HI> he had lived with, were slaves to their tyranny and vices, had also heard, in the same casual manner, that the service of the <HI>King</HI> was <HI>perfect freedom.</HI> Now he had taken it into his head to hope that this might be a freedom to do evil, or at least to do nothing, so he thought it was the only place in the world to suit him.</P>
<P>A sine likely young fellow as William was, had no great difficulty to get enlisted. The few forms were soon settled, he received the bounty-money as eagerly as it was offered, took the oaths of allegiance, and was joined to the regiment, and heartily welcomed by his new comrades. He was the happiest fellow alive. All was smooth and calm. The day happened to be very fine, and therefore William always reckoned upon a fine day. The scene was gay and lively, the music cheer∣ful, he found the exercise very easy, and he thought there was little more expected from him.</P>
<P>He soon began to flourish away in his talk; and when he met with any one of his old fellow-servants, he fell a prating about marches, and counter-marches, and blockades, and battles, and sieges, and blood, and death, and triumphs, and victories, all at random; for these were words and phrases he had picked up without at all understanding what he said. He had no knowledge, and therefore he had no modesty; he had no experience, and therefore he had no fears.</P>
<P>All seemed to go on swimmingly, for he had as yet no trial. He began to think with triumph what a mean life he had escaped from in the old quarrelsome family, and what a happy honorable life he should have in the army. <HI>O, there was no life like the life of a soldier.</HI></P>
<P>In a short time, however, war broke out, his regi∣ment was one of the first which was called out to actual and hard service. As William was the most raw of all the recruits, he was the first to murmur at the diffi∣culties and hardships, the cold and hunger, the fatigue
<PB N="293" REF="035296_0387_1001C14307DC0620"/>and danger, of being a soldier. O what watchings, and perils, and trials, and hardships, and difficulties, he now thought attended a military life! "Surely," said he, "I could never have suspected all this misery, when I used to see the men on the parade in our town."</P>
<P>He now found, when it was too late, that all the field-days he used to attend, all the evolutions and exer∣cises which he had observed the soldiers to go through in the calm times of peace and safety, were only meant to fit, train, and qualify them, for the actual service which they were now sent out to perform by the command of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, William often complained when there was no real hardship to complain of; for the common troubles of life fell out pretty much alike to the <HI>great family</HI> which William had lest, and to the soldiers in the <HI>King's army.</HI> But the spirit of obedience, discipline, and self-denial of the latter, seemed hardships to one of William's loose turn of mind. When he began to murmur, some good old soldier clapped him on the back, saying, "cheer up lad, it is a kingdom you are to strive for; if we faint not, henceforth there is laid up for us a great reward, we have the <HI>King's</HI> word for it man."—William observed that to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who truly believed this, their labors were as nothing, but he himself did not at the bottom believe it; and it was observed of all the soldiers who failed, the true cause was that they did not really believe the <HI>King's</HI> promise. He was surprized to see the then soldiers, who used to bluster, and boast, and deride the assaults of the enemy, now began to fall away; while such as had faithfully obeyed the <HI>King's</HI> orders, and believed in his word, were sustained in the hour of trial. Those who had trusted in their own strength, all fainted in the slightest attack, while those who had put on the armour of the <HI>King's</HI> providing, <HI>the sword,</HI> and <HI>the shield,</HI> and <HI>the helmet,</HI> and <HI>the breast∣plate,</HI> and whose <HI>feet were shod</HI> according to order, now
<PB N="294" REF="035296_0388_1001C14B96841D48"/>endured hardships as good soldiers, and were enabled to <HI>fight the good fight.</HI></P>
<P>An engagement was expected immediately. The men were ordered to prepare for battle. While the rest of the corps were so preparing, William's whole thoughts were bent on contriving how he might desert. But, alas! he was watched on all sides, he could not possibly devise any means to escape. The danger increased eve∣ry moment—the battle came on. William, who had been so sure and confident before he entered, flinched in the moment of trial; while his more quiet and less boast∣ful comrades, prepared boldly to do their duty. William looked about on all sides, and saw that there was no eye upon him, for he did not know that the <HI>King's</HI> eye was every where at once. He at last thought he spied a chance of escaping, not from the enemy, but from his own army. While he was endeavoring to escape, a ball from the opposite camp took off his leg. As he sell, the first words which broke from him were, "while I was in duty I was preserved, in the very act of desert∣ing I am wounded." He lay expecting every moment to be trampled to death, but as soon as the confusion was a little over, he was taken off the field by some of his own party, laid in a plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> safety, and left to himself, after his wound was dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></P>
<P>The skirmish, for it proved nothing more, was soon over. The greater part of the regiment escaped in safety, while the few who fell, rejoiced that they fell in their duty. William in the mean time suffered cruelly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in mind and body. To the pains of a wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldier, he added the disgrace of a coward, and the infa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of a deserter. "O," cried he, "why was I such a fool as to leave the <HI>great family</HI> I lived in, where there was meat and drink enough and to spare, only on ac∣count of a little quarrel? I might have made up that with them as we had done our former quarrels. Why did I leave a life of ease and pleasure, where I had only
<PB N="295" REF="035296_0389_1001C150A4A84ED0"/>a little rub now and then, for a life of daily discipline, and constant danger? Why did I turn soldier? O, what a miserable animal is a soldier!"</P>
<P>As he was sitting in this weak and disabled condition, uttering the above complaints, he observed a venerable old officer, with thin grey locks on his head, and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by time, and many an ho∣nest scar inflicted by war▪ William had heard this old officer highly commended for his extraordinary courage and conduct in battle, and in peace he used to see him cool and collected, devoutly employed in reading and praying, in the interval of more active duties. He could not help comparing this officer with himself. "I," said he, "flinched and drew-back, and would even have de∣serted in the moment of peril; and now, in return, I have no consolation in the hour of repose and safety. I would not fight then, I cannot pray now. O, why would I ever think of being a soldier?" He then began afresh to weep and lament, and he groaned so loud that he drew the notice of the officer, who came up to him, kindly sat down by him, took him by the hand, and enquired with as much affection as if he had been his brother, what was the matter with him, and what particular dis∣tress, more than the common fortune of war, it was which drew from him such bitter groans? "I know some∣thing of surgery," added he, "let me examine your wound, and assist you with such little comforts as I can."</P>
<P>William at once saw the difference between the sol∣diers in the <HI>King's</HI> army, and the people in the <HI>great family;</HI> the latter commonly withdrew their kindness in sickness and trouble, when most wanted, which was just the very time when the others came forward to as∣sist. He told the officer his little history, the manner of his living in the <HI>great family,</HI> the trifling cause of his quarrelling with it, the slight ground of his entering into the <HI>King's</HI> service. "Sir," said he, "I quarrelled with the family, and I thought I was at once fit for the
<PB N="296" REF="035296_0390_1001C154F4076D70"/>army: I did not know the qualifications it required.—I had not reckoned on discipline, and hardships, and self-denial. I liked well enough to sing a loyal song, or drink the King's health, but I find I do not relish work∣ing and fighting for him, though I rashly premised even to lay down my life for his service if called upon, when I took the bounty money and the oath of allegiance.—In short, Sir, I find that I long for the ease and sloth, the merriment and the feasting, of my old service; I find I cannot be a soldier, and, to speak truth, I was in the very act of deserting, when I was stopped short by the cannon ball. So that I feel the guilt of deserting, and the misery of having lost my leg into the bargain."</P>
<P>The officer thus replied, "your state is that of every worldly irreligious man. The <HI>great family</HI> you served is a just picture of the WORLD. The wages the world promises to those who are willing to do its work, are high, but the payment is attended with much disappoint∣ment; nay, the world, like your great family, is in it∣self insolvent, and in its very nature incapable of making good the promises, and of paying the high rewards which it holds out to tempt its credulous followers. The un∣godly world, like your family, cares little for church, and still less for prayers; and considers the bible rather as an instrument to make an oath binding, in order to keep the vulgar in obedience, than as containing in it∣self a perfect rule of faith and practice, and as a title-deed to heaven. The generality of men love the world as you did your service, while it smiles upon them, and gives them easy work, and plenty of meat and drink; but as soon as it begins to cross and contradict them, they get out of humour with it, just as you did with your service. They then think its drudgery hard, its rewards low. They find out that it is high in its ex∣pectations from them, and slack in its payments to them. And they begin to fancy (because they do not hear re∣ligious people murmur as they do) that there must be
<PB N="297" REF="035296_0391_1001C156F2938280"/>some happiness in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gion. The world, which takes no account of their deeper sins, at length brings them into discredit for some act of imprudence, just as your family overlooked your lying and swearing, but threatened to drub you for breaking a china dish; such is the judg∣ment of the world, it particularly bears with those who only break the laws of God, but severely punishes the smallest negligence by which property is injured. The world sooner pardons the breaking ten commandments of God, than even a china dish of its own.</P>
<P>"After some cross or opposition, worldly men, as I said before, begin to think how much content and cheerful∣ness they remember to have seen in religious people.—They therefore begin to fancy that religion must be an easy and delightful as well as a good thing. They have heard that <HI>her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;</HI> and they persuade themselves that by this is meant worldly pleasantness and sensual peace. They resolve at length to try it, to turn their back up∣on the world, to engage in the service of God and turn christians; just as you resolved to leave your old ser∣vice, to enter into the service of the King and turn sol∣dier. But as you quitted your place in a passion, so they leave the world in a huff. They do not count the cost. They do not calculate upon the darling sins, the habitual pleasures, the ease and vanities, which they un∣dertake by their new engagements to renounce, any more than you counted what indulgencies you were go∣ing to give up, when you quitted the luxuries and idle∣ness of your place to enlist in the soldier's warfare.—They have, as I said, seen christians cheerful, and they mistook the ground of their cheerfulness; they fancied it arose, not because through grace they had conquered difficulties, but because they had no difficulties in their passage. They fancied that religion found the road smooth, whereas it only helps to bear with a rough road without complaint. They do not know that these chris∣tians
<PB N="298" REF="035296_0392_1001C161DD1CBE58"/>are of good cheer, not because the world is free from tribulation, but because Christ, their captain, has <HI>overcome the world.</HI> But the irreligious man, who has only seen the outside of a christian in his worldly inter∣course, knows little of his secret conflicts, his trials, his self-denials, his warfare with the world without, and with his own corrupt desires within.</P>
<P>The irreligious man quarrels with the world, on some such occasion as you did with your place. He now puts on the outward forms and ceremonies of religion, and assumes the badges of chistianity, just as you were struck with the shows of a field day; just as you were pleased with the music and the marching, and put on the cock∣ade and the red coat. All seems smooth for a little while. He goes through the outward exercises of a christian, a degree of credit attends his new profession, but he never suspects there is either difficulty or discipline attending it; he fancies religion is a thing for talking about, and not a thing of the heart and the life. He never suspects that all the psalm-singing he joins in, and the sermons he hears, and the other means he is using, are only as the exercises and the evolutions of the soldiers, to fit and prepare him for actual service; and that these means are no more religion itself, than the exercises and evo∣lutions of your parade were real warfare.</P>
<P>At length some trial arises. This nominal christian is called to differ from the world in some great point; something happens which may strike at his comfort, or his credit, or security. This cools his zeal for religion, just as the view of an engagement cooled your courage as a soldier. He finds he was only angry with the world, he was not tired of it. He was out of humor with the world, not because he had seen through its vanity and emptiness, but because the world was out of humor with him. He finds that it is an easy thing to be a fair weather christian, bold where there is nothing to be done, and confident where there is nothing to be fear∣ed
<PB N="299" REF="035296_0393_1001C168EDD35A90"/>Difficulties unmask him to others; temptations unmask him to himself; he discovers that though he is a high professor, he is no christian; just as you found out that your red coat and your cockade, your shoulder knot, and your musket, did not prevent you from be∣ing a coward.</P>
<P>Your misery in the military life, like that of the no∣minal christian, arose from your love of ease, your cow∣ardice, and your self-ignorance. You rushed into a new way of life, without trying after one qualification for it. A total change of heart and temper were necessary for your new calling. With new views and new princi∣ples, the soldier's life would have been not only easy but delightful to you. But while with a new profes∣sion you retained your old nature, it is no wonder all discipline seemed intolerable to you.</P>
<P>The true christian, like the brave soldier, is support∣ed under dangers by a strong faith that the fruits of that victory for which he fights will be safety and peace.—But, alas! the pleasures of this world are present and visible; the kingdom and the crown for which he strives are remote. He is therefore apt to think them uncertain. He is therefore apt to fail, because nothing short of a lively saith can outweigh the present tempta∣tion, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> teach him to prefer the joys of conquest to the pleasures of sloth.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENERAL RESURRECTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>PART I.</HI> Being a description taken from Scripture, of some of the events which will come to pass at the end of the world.</HEAD>
<P>EVER since sin entered into the world and death by sin, this earth has been a vast grave-yard, or burying place for her children. In every age, and in every country, that sentence has been executing, <HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</HI> Mankind at first consisted only of one pair, but how inconceiva∣bly numerous are now the sons of Adam! One single nation commonly contains many millions of men, and these millions form only one generation. How many, then, must be the millions that have appeared on the earth in the long run of near six thousand years!—Let imagination cal lup this vast army; infants that have just lived to see the light, multitudes of the young and middle aged, and all the old and grey-headed also—persons of all countries and of successive generations—let them all pass in review before us, and now vast and astonishing is the multitude! If the posterity of one man, Abraham, by one of his sons was, according to the language of divine promise, <HI>as the stars of heaven and as the sand by the sea-shore, innumerable,</HI> who can compute the multitudes that have sprung from all the different patriarchs? Who can number the long line of children that have proceeded from Adam, and all the fa∣milies of the earth that have sprung from the loins of Noah! But what is now become of this vast and in∣conceivable
<PB N="301" REF="035296_0395_1001C36B368C7658"/>host? Alas! they are again turned into earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> original element; they are all sunk into the grave, except<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng only the present generation; and we also are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng down one after another, into that place appointed for all living. There has hardly, perhaps, been one moment of time, during the space of many thousand years, in which one person or other has not been dropping into the grave: and in some seasons, through the sword of war, the devouring pestilence, or rather visitations of God, thousands have been mowed down at once, and have formed one undistinguished heap of dead. The greater part of mankind beyond comparison, are now sleeping under ground. There lies beauty, mouldering into dust, a prey to the vilest worms; there lies the mean and humble beggar; and there lies the head that once wore a crown. There lie the mighty giants, the Sampsons, and the Caesars of the world. There lie the wise and the learned, as weak and helpless as the fool. There lie some with whom we ourselves have conversed, and who were once our dear friends and our companions; and there lie our fathers and mothers; and there perhaps also lies a ten∣der wife or husband, a child, a sister, or a brother.</P>
<P>And shall they lie there always? Shall this body, that curious wormanship of God, <HI>so fearfully and wonder∣fully made,</HI> continue always in these ruins, and shall it never be restored? This we know, that <HI>it is not a thing impossible with God to raise the dead.</HI> He that could first form our bodies out of nothing is just as able to form them anew, and to repair the wastes of time and death. But what has he declared to be his intention in this case? for on this the matter turns; and it is a point which is fully revealed in the Scriptures. <HI>The hour is coming,</HI> says that sacred book, <HI>when all that are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and shall come forth; they that have done well, to the resurrec∣tion of life; and they that have done evil, to the resur∣rection
<PB N="302" REF="035296_0396_1001C36D47AA3FF0"/>of damnation. Behold,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep,</HI> (that is, mankind will not all be sleeping in deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when the day of re∣surrection comes, for there will be one generation re∣maining then alive upon earth;) <HI>but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised, incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now realize the majesty and terror of this tre∣mendous day. When the multitudes of the dead are sleeping in the silent grave; when many perhaps of the living are thoughtless of this great event; when some men are running eagerly, as they are now, after riches and honors, and some after sensual pleasures; while they are eating and drinking, marrying and giving in mar∣riage; while some are asleep in the dead of night; while some are planning future mischief; and some are in the very act of sin; while the course of nature seems to go on as usual, so that unbelieving scoffers take oc∣casion from thence to ask <HI>where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the crea∣tion.</HI> When, perhaps, a few only are serving God, and are looking for their Saviour's appearance—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile the multitude in short no more expect the approaching judgment than the people or Sodom did the destruction which befel them on that fine clear morning when Lot fled away; or than the people of the old world expect∣ed the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luge on the day when Noah entered the ask—th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suddenly shall the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns open over the astonished world, and <HI>the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible;</HI> for in an instant the sound
<PB N="303" REF="035296_0397_1001C36FA0AD7E68"/>shall reach all the mansions of the dead, and <HI>in a mo∣ment, in the twinkling of an eye,</HI> the dead shall be rai∣sed and the living shall be changed. This call will be as effectual in raising each of the sons of men as ever that call of Christ was, <HI>Lazarus, come forth.</HI> O, what a surprise will it be to the thoughtless world! Should this alarm burst over our heads this moment, with what terror would it strike many a one who read this description of it? How dreadful, then, will be the surprise and con∣sternation when this event shall actually come to pass! Now, indeed, there are many who stop their ears:—Now, though the voice of mercy calls, though reason pleads, and conscience warns, yet multitudes will not hear; but then there shall be no one among the mil∣lions of mankind that shall be able to disobey the sum∣mons, for the living shall start, and be changed, and the dead rise at the sound.</P>
<P>But for what purpose shall they rise? It is in order that they may come to judgment. <HI>For we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> all ap∣pear before the judgment-seat of Christ, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st give an account of the things done in the body, whether they be good or whether they be evil. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life eternal. And I saw,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>the dead, small and great stand before God; and the books were open∣ed, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works; and the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell</HI> (that is the place of departed spirits) <HI>delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were judged every man according to their works, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. And I saw,</HI> continues the same apostle, <HI>a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
<PB N="304" REF="035296_0398_1001C373E2F28880"/>there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, for the former things are passed away. And he that sat on the throne said, behold, I make all things new.</HI> In like manner we are told in another place, that <HI>the heavens and the earth are but kept in store until the day of destruction and perdition of ungodly men;</HI> and that when this <HI>great and terrible day of the Lord</HI> shall come, then <HI>the very elements shall melt with servent heat—the earth also, and all the works thereof shall be burnt up—the heavens shall depart as a scroll—they all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shall be changed;</HI> and there shall then he <HI>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</HI> Well might the apostle say, <HI>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness.</HI></P>
<P>There are many things spoken of in Scripture that shall follow the grand scene of the resurrection, which remain to be described; but we shall speak in this place only of one further point, and that is of the person who is to be our judge. It will be Jesus Christ, <HI>for the Father,</HI> says the Scripture, <HI>judgeth no man, for God hath committed all judgment to the Son, because he is the Son of Man. This same Jesus,</HI> said the angels, just after his resurrection, <HI>which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</HI> Once he was <HI>despised and rejected of men; he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth;</HI> he was <HI>mocked, and buffeted, and spit upon;</HI> he was himself arraigned before the bar of Pontius Pi∣late, and he was hung upon the Cross as if he was the vilest malefactor, the whole multitude having joined in the cry, crucify him, crucify him. But now, <HI>behold he cometh in the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and all nations of the earth shall wall because of him. For the Lord Jesus shall be re∣vealed
<PB N="305" REF="035296_0399_1001A434B3263530"/>from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> now also he is <HI>come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admi∣red in all them that believe.</HI> Some men think that to forget or to disobey Christ is no great matter; they are good, as they call it, in their own way, and therefore they are satisfied. But such men should be reminded, that it is not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bar of their own reason, nor even at the bar merely of their own consciences, that they are to be tried, but that they are to be tried at the bar of Jesus Christ. <HI>The word that I have spoken to you,</HI> said our Saviour to the Pharisees, <HI>it shall judge you at the last day.</HI> Let us further enquire, then, what Christ hath spoken to us, and what the Scripture in general hath said respecting the manner of our trial on the day of judgment, for this is the way in which alone we can truly know whether we shall be acquitted or condemn∣ed.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="addresses">
<HEAD>Address to individuals on the subject of the following Prayers.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many persons, it is to be feared, who do not accustom themselves to pray at all, than which there cannot be a greater proof of irreligion. Some of these may plead perhaps that they have never been taught to pray, or at least that they have no suitable prayer provided for them. To such persons an oppor∣tunity is now given of beginning what they cannot but allow to be a good custom, for who can deny that is a good custom, or rather indeed, that it is a bound∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n daty to call day by day on the God who made them.</P>
<P>There are other persons who oblige themselves daily to say over the Lord's prayer only, and perhaps also the belief. This is often done in a very formal and super∣stitious manner. The Lord's prayer is undoubtedly a most excellent pattern for our daily prayers, but it does not appear to have been given by Christ as the only form of prayer that was to be used; and it is worthy of remark that when he uttered it, he took occasion to warn his disciples against the vain repetitions used in prayer by the Pharisees. It is to be feared that even the Lord's prayer has become a vain repetition in these days, not through any fault in the prayer itself, but through the unthinking, and perhaps, over frequent way in which some people use it. Possibly a new form may
<PB N="307" REF="035296_0401_1001C37A55CD4898"/>supply some new thoughts, and may serve to awaken the sort of people I am speaking of to a sense of the true meaning and use both of the Lord's prayer and of prayer in general.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO PARENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is hoped that there can be little occasion to inform parents that they ought to teach their children to pray. A short prayer, fit for persons of twelve or fourteen years of age, is here supplied. The same prayer may serve both for morning and evening, and the memory, there∣fore, will be little burthened by learning it by heart.—Before children entirely leave their father's house, it is desirable that, instead of the child's prayer, they should learn by heart the morning and evening prayer for a grown person, which follows.</P>

<HEAD>ON FAMILY PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>The advantages of family prayer are many, and they are very plain. The master of a family (or the mistress in his absence) by devoutly reading a morning and eve∣ning prayer to his family, instructs both his children and servants in their duty, accustoms them to prayer, makes an open profession of his own religion, brings himself under an obligation to observe a consistent, that is, a religious conduct during the day; and above all let it be remarked, he draws down the blessing of God on himself and his household. Four prayers are here offered to masters and mistresses of families, and they who have not yet been used to family prayer, have now therefore, an opportunity of beginning this good cus∣tom, and in doing it may God grant them his bles∣sing!</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>General Directions, appli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le chiefly to the case of private Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>First, before you proceed to your private prayers, endeavor to compose your thoughts, and then ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>e yourself for a few moments. Ask yourself in the morn∣ing, for instance, what are likely to be the duties and trials of the day that is before you, and in the evening reflect what have been the sins of the day past. By do∣ing so, you will be enabled to apply the words of your prayer more particularly to your own case, and possi∣bly also you may thus be led to add a few words of your own to what you have got by heart, and by degrees you may thus be inclined to enlarge your daily petition more and more in your own words, and thus you may learn to pray in spirit and in truth.</P>
<P>Secondly, when about to pray, endeavor to lift up your heart to God for the help of his Holy Spirit; for the Scripture t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls us, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Spirit that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>th our infir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rities,</HI> Many p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain or great
<PB N="309" REF="035296_0403_1001C37E08C51E00"/>coldness and indifference while engaged in prayer, and there are few who are not conscious of this in a great∣er or less degree. Let all them begin, by imploring God's Holy Spirit to assist them in praying as they ought. There cannot be a better introduction to every kind of prayer, than a few secret words first uttered to this effect from the heart.</P>
<P>Thirdly, beware of wandering thoughts when enga∣ged in prayer. To this end let every struggle be made, and let it be seriously impressed upon you, that God is now present in an especial manner, and that all absence of mind which is allowed and indulged is a great affront to his majesty.</P>
<P>Fourthly, but besides being attentive, take care that you are also sincere in your prayer. Ask yourself often whether you mean what you say while you are praying and whether you sincerely and earnestly wish the thing that you ask. Accustom yourself not to attend to the mere sound of your words, but to the sense; and if you do not well understand any part of the prayers here of∣fered you, endeavor to get what is difficult explained before you repeat it. Some persons have been known to say prayers day by day, almost every word of which they have contradicted by their whole conversation and conduct. What a terrible hypocrisy is this! A man's prayers may either be the greatest blessing to him or the most grievous sin, according to the manner in which he performs them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, endeavor not only to be sincere in your prayers at the moment when you offer them, but en∣deavor also, that the same spirit which animates your prayers, may animate your whole life. To this end, examine your life often by means of your prayers. Try whether all your maxims in life, your common speech, and your several tempers, as well as your open conduct agree with the prayers which you use. The sincerity which God requires of you is not a momentary since∣rity,
<PB N="310" REF="035296_0404_1001C382F94DFBA0"/>it is not a short lived and changeable feeling which is forgotten when you go into the world. The remem∣brance of what you have been praying for in the morn∣ing should follow you into the field or the shop, and should influence your conduct all the day long.</P>
<P>Lastly, consider whether God answers your pray∣ers. If you pray aright, depend upon it your prayers will be heard and answered; your tempers will be sub∣dued, your temptations weakened, and your whole mind will be rendered pious if you really pray that it may be so; and if this be not the case, you may reasona∣bly suspect that your prayers have not been such as they ought. If you pray aright, depend upon it, you will improve in every respect; you will gain more humili∣ty, more tenderness of conscience, more fear of God, more pleasure in his worship, and more happiness in his service, and also more confidence in Christ, and probably more hope of salvation in proportion to the earnestness and sincerity of your prayers to God to this effect, for these are all the gifts of that holy spirit which God hath promised to them that ask it.</P>

<P>O Lord God Almighty, I thank thee for having preserved me through the past night, and for granting me health and strength for my duties on this day.— Blessed be the Lord for all his mercies, for giving me food to eat and raiment to put on, and for delivering me from many evils which my sins have justly deserved.</P>

Grant me grace to labor on this day diligently in my calling, and to be true and just in all my dealings, doing unto others as I would they should do unto me; and help me, O Lord, to restrain my tongue, and to subdue my evil tempers, and to live in temperance, soberness, and chastity.

<P>O Lord God Almighty, who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day, we thank thee for thy merciful preservation of us through the past night.—We also thank thee for all thy goodness to us, for our health and strength, and food and raiment, and friends and benefactors. More especially we bless thy name for giving us the Holy Scriptures, in order that we may be instructed in the will of God, and in the way of e∣verlasting life.</P>
<P>Dispose, O Lord, all who are here present, to attend reverently to the truths they hear, and suffer them not to give way to indolence, or carelessness of mind, or to hardness of heart and unbelief. Teach them also to ap∣ply the Scriptures to their own use. When they read of thy judgments may they stand in awe of thy great power and majesty, and when they read of thy promi∣ses, and especially of thy mercies in Christ, may their
<PB N="314" REF="035296_0408_1001C38E84CDBC80"/>hearts be filled with gratitude to their Redeemer, and may they take delight in singing thy praises.</P>
<P>And we pray thee, O Lord, to grant unto them the continual help of thy Holy Spirit, that they may day by day be preserved from sin, and may become fruitful in every good work. May they be faithful to the Lord their God, and upright in their conduct towards all men. May they be true and honest in all their deal∣ings, doing unto others as they would that others should do unto them. May they be obedient to their parents and teachers; and may they be temperate, sober, and diligent; may no untruth proceed out or their lips, and may they learn both to command their tempers and restrain their tongues, and may they be kind and mer∣ciful to each other, forgiving one another, even as they hope that God, for Christ's sake, will forgive them.</P>
<P>And pardon, O Lord, all their sins in time past, which either in thought, word, or deed they have com∣mitted against thee. Receive, O Lord, all these chil∣dren into thy favor, and into the arms of thy mercy; grant unto them true repentance, and an unfeigned faith in Jesus Christ their Lord.</P>
<P>We also beseech thee to prepare them for all those events in life which thy Providence may see fit at any time to bring upon them. Thou knowest the various temptations and troubles to which before long they may be exposed, and the situations to which they may be called. We therefore pray thee now to arm them for every future trial, and to train them up for the per∣formance of all those duties which thou shalt hereafter re∣quire of them. May they be grounded in the knowledge of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, and may they now begin to sight under the banners of their Saviour against the world, the flesh, and the devil; and as they ad∣vance in life may they grow in grace, each of them striving to recommend that gospel which they have been taught, and shining as lights in the world.</P>

<P>We offer up these our prayers in the name of Jesus Christ, through whom alone we hope for the pardon of our sins, and in whose words we further call upon thee.</P>

<P>We pray also for the whole rising generation; may they be trained up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

<P>O Lord our heavenly Father, we beseech thee to hear the prayers which we are about to offer up unto thee; deliver us from all wandering thoughts, and help us to remember that we are now in the presence of that God unto whom all heart are open, and from whom no secrets are hid.</P>
<P>O God we pray thee to forgive the sins of the past day. We acknowledge that we have this day left un∣done
<PB N="319" REF="035296_0413_1001C39F8303F900"/>many things which we ought to have done, and done many things which we ought not to have done. We have trespassed against thee in thought, word, and deed, and though we have been encouraged by thy gospel to repent of our iniquities, and to serve God in newness of life, yet we have many times returned to those sins which we profess to have repented of, and we have fallen under thy just wrath and displeasure.</P>
<P>But we pray thee, O thou God of all grace and goodness, for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ, to par∣don all that is past, and to take us into thy favor this night, not weighing our merits, but forgiving our of∣fences, and causing us to place our humble trust in thy mercy. Deliver us, we pray thee, from the troubles of a guilty conscience, now that we are about to lie down to rest. Save us, O Lord, from the dread of death, and from the terrors of the wrath to come. Grant un∣to us, if it please thee, a quiet night, and make us all to be at peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>At the same time we beseech thee, not to suffer that we should deceive ourselves by any false hope, but give us grace, day by day, to examine ourselves with care and diligence, that we may discover all that is amiss in us. O Lord deliver us from continuing in any known sin. Save us from every secret iniquity; may we each of us resolve before we go to rest this night, to forsake, by thy grace assisting us, every former transgression, and may we now devote ourselves entirely to thy ser∣vice.</P>

<P>We thank thee, O Lord, for all the blessings of this life, but especially we praise thee for giving us thy ho∣ly word, for sending to us the ministers of thy gospel, and for appointing the Sabbath to be a season of rest for our bodies, and to be a day on which we may also at∣tend to the salvation of our immortal souls.</P>
<P>O Lord, grant we beseech thee, that we may right∣ly use the religious opportunities which we enjoy.—Preserve us from thoughtlessness and inattention dur∣ing thy public worship. In prayer may we feel our need of the mercies we implore. In the confession of sin, may we be affected with the sense of our unworthi∣ness, and in offering up thanksgivings to God, may we pour out our whole hearts before thee. We pray also, that when we shall hear thy word read, and the gospel of Jesus Christ preached to us, we may listen with an attentive ear, and receive thy truth into an honest and good heart.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="035296_0415_1001C35F89CE3548"/>
And we beseech thee to preserve in us a right frame of mind throughout the day that is now before us.—May we remember that this is the day on which our Saviour rose from the dead, having by his death ob∣tained eternal redemption for us. May we therefore think of our ascended Lord, and may we put away from us all folly and vanity, as well as vice and wickedness, and all eager desires after the things of this life, and all anger and passion, and envy, and malice, and whatsoe∣ver else is either unsuitable to this sacred day, or is un∣becoming the followers of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>O Lord, we lament that in passing through the week we are so often entangled by the cares of this life, and overpowered by temptations which come upon us un∣awares. But we pray thee now to call away our tho'ts from earthly things, and to fix them on those unspeak∣able joys which are at thy right hand for evermore.—We pray thee on this day to strengthen our faith, to encrease our hope, and to fill our hearts with love to thee, and with fervent charity towards our neighbor. Help us also to repent of our sins, examining carefully our conduct during the week, and thus may we learn to amend our lives, and to run with patience the race that is set before us.</P>
<P>And, together with these prayers for ourselves, we offer up our supplications in behalf of all christian con∣gregations. Give thy grace to all the ministers of thy gospel, and enable them every where this day to preach thy word with faithfulness to the souls of men. Make thy gospel effectual, to pull down the pride of the high minded, to alarm the careless, and convince the waver∣ing, to encourage them that are as yet weak in faith, and to give peace and consolation to every troubled heart.</P>
<P>And, O Lord, we beseech thee, to send thy gospel to the nations which now sit in darkness. Put an end to all false religion, and idolatry, and ignorance, and

<P>We pray thee, O Lord, to give thy blessing to the instruction which we have this day heard, and to grant that it may be so grafted inwardly in all our hearts, as to bring forth in us the fruits of good living, to the praise and glory of thy name. Pardon also whatsoever thou hast seen amiss in our worship and services on this day.</P>
<P>And accept, O Lord, our humble confession of all those great and manifold sins, which, from time to time both in thought, word, and deed, we have committed against thee: for we have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and we have done those things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us. We have sinned, O Lord, by our pride and vanity, by our indulgence of many sinful passions, by our fretfulness, impatience, and discontent, by our e∣mulation, our ambition, and our covetousness. We have sinned also by our sloth and negligence, by our forgetfulness of many duties of our calling, by our too great love of this present world, and by our carelessness in following many of those evil customs which we have found in it. More especially we have sinned by our inattention to thy written word, to thy preached gospel and to all the means of thy grace.</P>
<P>For these, and all our numberless offences, we here

<P>We also beseech thee, for Christ's sake, to grant unto us the help of thy holy spirit, that we may now forsake every evil way, and may amend our lives according to thy holy word. O Lord, preserve us through the en∣suing week from sinning against thee. Save us from the world, the flesh, and the devil. Carry us through all our temptations and dangers. Fit us for whatsoever duties are before us, and when we have fulfilled thy will on earth, receive us to thine eternal kingdom, through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And the same things which we have been imploring for ourselves, we humbly ask in behalf of our dear friends and relations. Grant unto them pardon of their sins, an humble faith in Jesus Christ their Lord, and grace to walk in the way of thy commandments. Be merciful to the land in which we live. Bless our king and all in authority. Give thine especial grace to the ministers of thy gospel, that they may both preach thy true and lively word, and may also be examples to their flock of all virtue and goodness. Let thy blessing also descend on all the faithful followers of Jesus Christ. Save them from the temptations which are in the world: strengthen their faith and hope, and unite them in the bonds of christian charity with each other; and have pity on all those who neglect thy gospel, and profane thy Sabbaths, and live as if there was no God in the world. Convince them of their sins before it is too late, and incline them to seek for mercy, through that Saviour whose grace they now despise. And O Lord, deliver every one of us from all hardness of heart and contempt of thy word and commandments. Make us to lie down this night thankfull for the opportunities of
