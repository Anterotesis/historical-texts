<P>THE Declaration of Independence, by which these States took an equal Station among the Nations of the Earth, is dated July 4, 1776. The Articles of Confederation between the said States were finally ratified on the 1st of March, 1781. The Supreme Power of the United States is lodged in a Congress of Delegates from each of the States; but each State retains its Sovereignty and Independence, and every Right which is not expressly de∣legated to the United States in Congress assembled.</P>

<P>That under the 41st and 40th Degrees, the Western, thro' which the Illinois runs, to be called <HI>Illinoia:</HI> that next adjoining to the Eastward, to be called <HI>Saratoga:</HI> and that between this last and Pennsylva∣nia, to be called <HI>Washington.</HI> That un∣der the 39th and 38th Degrees, adjacent to which are the Confluences of the Rivers Wabash, Sewanee, Tanissee, Ohio, Illinois, Mississippi and Missouri, to be called <HI>Po∣lypotamia,</HI> i. e. <HI>Many Rivers:</HI> and that to the Eastward, farther up the Ohio, to be called <HI>Pelisipia,</HI> i. e. <HI>the Country of Skins.</HI>
