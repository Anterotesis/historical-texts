<HEAD>APOLOGY FOR THE WORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE following treatise was written at the desire of Miss S. and Miss M. Par∣ker; who were themselves educated for the purpose of educating others; and on that account were originally placed in dif∣ferent seminaries for female tuition; and afterwards engaged themselves for a time as teachers in other schools, and in private families; the better to qualify themselves for the arduous task of conducting a board∣ing school for the education of young ladies.</P>
<P><PB REF="033601_0007_0FF7A15125B93230"/>
About four years ago a house was offer∣ed for sale at Ashborne in Derbyshire, at the very extremity of the town, in a most pleasant and healthy situation, on a dry sandy soil, with excellent water, well shel∣tered from the north-east, and command∣ing an extensive prospect of Sir Brooke Boothby's park, and its beautiful environs.</P>
<P>A spacious walled garden adjoins the house, at the bottom of which is a stream of water, which may sometime be convert∣ed into a river-bath.</P>
<P>Miss PARKERS procured this eligible situation, and had the house well fitted up for the purposes of a boarding school. It consists of an ample school-room, and an ample dining-room, and four smaller par∣lours,
<PB REF="033601_0008_0FF7A15397C32910"/>on the principal floor; with two stair-cases, one of which is of stone. The whole is airy and well lighted; and now contains about thirty pupils without being crowded.</P>
<P>They next had the good fortune to en∣gage very excellent teachers in dancing, music, and drawing, from Nottingham, Derby, &amp;c. with a polite emigrant as French master; and lastly applied to me for any ideas, I could furnish them with, on the subject of female education. And now, as their establishment has succeeded to their utmost wish, have expressed a desire, that I would give to the public, what I wrote originally for their private inspec∣tion.</P>
<P><PB REF="033601_0009_0FF7A1552F21C3F0"/>
I have only to add, that a copy of the manuscript has been seen by many of the ingenious of both sexes, and much improv∣ed by their observations; to whom I here beg leave to return my most grateful ac∣knowledgments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A PLAN</HI> FOR THE CONDUCT OF FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE PARENTS and guardians of young ladies of the last half century were less solicitous about procuring for them so extensive an education, as modern refine∣ment requires. Hence it happens, that female education has not yet been reduced to a perfect system; but is frequently di∣rected by those, who have not themselves had a good education, or who have not stu∣died the subject with sufficient attention. And tho' many ingenious remarks are to be
<PB N="10" REF="033601_0011_0FF7A15B26BB0A00"/>found in the works of Locke, Rousseau, Genlis, and other writers still more mo∣dern; yet few of them are exactly appli∣cable to the management of boarding schools; the improvement of which is the intent of the present treatise.</P>
<P>The advantages of a good education consist in uniting health and agility of bo∣dy with cheerfulness and activity of mind; in superadding graceful movements to the former, and agreeable tastes to the latter; and in the acquirement of the rudiments of such arts and sciences, as may amuse our∣selves, or gain us the esteem of others; with a strict attention to the culture of mo∣rality and religion.</P>
<P>The female character should possess the mild and retiring virtues rather than the bold and dazzling ones; great eminence in almost any thing is sometimes injurious to a young lady; whose temper and disposi∣tion should appear to be pliant rather than
<PB N="11" REF="033601_0012_0FF7A15CB4BD4FF0"/>robust; to be ready to take impressions ra∣ther than to be decidedly marked; as great apparent strength of character, however excellent, is liable to alarm both her own and the other sex; and to create admira∣tion rather than affection.</P>
<P>There are however situations in single life; in which, after the completion of their school-education, ladies may culti∣vate to any extent the fine arts or the sci∣ences for their amusement or instruction. And there are situations in a married state; which may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care, education, or pro∣vision, for a family; which the inactivity, folly, or death of a husband may render ne∣cessary. Hence if to softness of manners, complacency of countenance, gentle un∣hurried motion, with a voice clear and yet tender, the charms which enchant all hearts! can be superadded internal strength and activity of mind, capable to transact the business or combat the evils of life;
<PB N="12" REF="033601_0013_0FF7A15E46B70268"/>with a due sense of moral and religious obligation; all is obtained, which education can supply; the female character becomes complete, excites our love, and commands our admiration.</P>
<P>Education should draw the outline, and teach the use of the pencil; but the exertions of the individual must afterwards introduce the various gradations of shade and colour, must illuminate the landscape, and fill it with the beautiful figures of the Graces and the Virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0014_0FF7A160E9C35C48"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II. MUSIC AND DANCING</HEAD>
<P>ARE generally taught by masters, who profess those arts; concerning which we shall only observe, that they are fre∣quently believed to be of too great impor∣tance in female education; and on that ac∣count that too much time is expended on their acquirement. It is perhaps more desirable, that young ladies should play, sing, and dance, only so well as to amuse themselves and their friends, than to prac∣tise those arts in so eminent a degree as to astonish the public; because a great appa∣rent attention to trivial accomplishments is liable to give a suspicion, that more va∣luable acquisitions have been neglected. And, as they consist in an exhibition of the person, they are liable to be attended with vanity, and to extinguish the blush of youthful timidity; which is in young ladies the most powerful of their exterior charms.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033601_0015_0FF7A163763F5FF8"/>
Such masters should be chosen to in∣struct young ladies in these accomplish∣ments, as are not only well qualified to sing and play, or to dance themselves; but also who can teach with good temper and genteel behaviour: they should recollect, that vulgar manners, with the sharp ges∣tures of anger, and its disagreeable tones of voice, are unpardonable in those, who profess to teach graceful motion, and me∣lodious expression; and may affect the taste and temper of their pupils, so as to be more injurious to their education; than any thing, which they are able to teach them, can counterbalance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0016_0FF7A165EBA22A80"/>
<HEAD>SECTION III. READING.</HEAD>
<P>AS reading is as much a language to the eye, as speaking is to the ear; it re∣quires much time and labour for children to acquire both these languages. Such books should therefore be put into their hands, as join amusement with instruction, and thus lighten the fatigue of continued application, as Sandford and Merton, Pa∣rent's assistant, Evenings at home, and ma∣ny others.</P>
<P>In learning to read aloud, a clear and distinct enunciation is seldom acquired at schools; which is owing to the child stand∣ing close to the teacher, who looks over the book along with it; and hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being understood, even when she pronounces only half words. This however is easily remedied by placing the reader at the distance of
<PB N="16" REF="033601_0017_0FF7A167797580D0"/>two yards or more from the hearer; then the young scholar soon finds, that she is not understood, unless she expresses her∣self with clear articulation. For this pur∣pose the teacher should always be provided with a duplicate of the book, she teaches; that she may not be necessitated to look over the shoulder of her pupil.</P>
<P>As the young scholars advance in the knowledge of language, other books must be taught them both in prose and poetry; such as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things, in morality, religion, or which may form their taste. A great number of books for the use of children has been published in late years; many of them by very ingenious writers, and well adapted to the purpose designed, of such of these, as have come to my knowledge, a catalogue shall be given at the end of this treatise.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0018_0FF7A16A0AFF3F20"/>
<HEAD>SECTION. IV. WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>WRITING, as it keeps the body in a fixed posture, as well as drawing, and needlework, should not be too long appli∣ed to at a time; since the body, and even the countenance, may thus get a certain tendency to one attitude; as is seen in children, who are brought up to some me∣chanic art, as in polishing buttons or pre∣cious stones on a lathe. A proper manner of holding the pen, or pencil, or needle, with an easy but graceful attitude of the person, and an agreeable moderate atten∣tion of the countenance, should first be taught; for which purposes an inclined desk has many advantages over an horizon∣tal table for the books, or working frames; as the body is thence less bent forwards; and the light in general situations more vi∣vidly reflected to the eye.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="033601_0019_0FF7A16D8477B128"/>
If the desk be sixteen inches broad, the furthermost edge of it should rise about three inches and half from the horizontal line; which produces the most convenient inclination, and the table or frame, which supports it, for the use of the taller chil∣dren, should rise about two feet eight inch∣es from the ground.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0020_0FF7A16F11811C10"/>
<HEAD>SECTION V. GRAMMAR,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH is an abstract science teaching the texture of language, is too hard for very young minds; and is there∣fore generally taught too early: and the same may be said of Arithmetic. The English grammars in general use at schools are both tedious and defective composi∣tions; an epitome, or extract, from Lowth's grammar, with the late improvements of Mr. Horne Tooke in the theory of lan∣guage, would well supply this branch of knowledge; and might be given to the public under the name of a "rational English grammar."</P>
<P>Mrs. Devis has published a small and useful rudiment of grammar purposely for the use of young ladies: which may be taught as an introduction to Lowth's grammar. The Abbe Gaultier's Jeu de
<PB N="20" REF="033601_0021_0FF7A170A057BD48"/>Grammaire may perhaps be rendered a∣musing to children, and convey to them ideas of the French grammar.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0022_0FF7A1740B489490"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VI. LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE necessity of learning some an∣tient or foreign languages imposes a labori∣ous task on the youth of both sexes; which consumes years of their precious time, which might otherwise be employed in the acquisition of sciences. The difficulty of obtaining a competent knowledge of the Greek or Latin language is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one; as may be deduced from the innu∣merable changes of the termination of their nouns, adjectives, and verbs; which to a beginner are all so many new words. And as the works of the best writers in these languages have been translated into our own, it is less necessary in the education of ladies to expend so much time and la∣bour in acquiring them. But as the French and Italian are less difficult to learn, and contain new books of taste and knowledge,
<PB N="22" REF="033601_0023_0FF7A175983693F0"/>which are yearly published in this age of literature; and as they are convenient for conversing with foreigners, who come hither, or in our travelling into other countries; and lastly, as they are agree∣able as well as fashionable studies; the pupils of boarding schools should be en∣couraged to attain one or both of them.</P>
<P>The method recommended by Mr. Locke in his treatise on education, sect. 162, of teaching languages by conversa∣tion, will on trial be generally found suc∣cessful in respect to modern languages with even the youngest children. Never∣theless a knowledge of grammar should afterwards be taught with care, if the child be too young at first to attend to it; for without the aid of grammar not only the French or Italian languages, but even the English will not always be spoken or writ∣ten with perfect accuracy.</P>
<P>For this purpose of acquiring modern languages by conversation, a school gene∣rally
<PB N="23" REF="033601_0024_0FF7A178140A2850"/>supplies better opportunities than a private family, besides the advantage of some degree of emulation, which frequent∣ly exists, where children converse to∣gether: another advantage of infantine so∣ciety is, that they learn many other things, as well as languages, by repeating them to each other; and obtain, what is seldom to be acquired from adult companions, some knowledge of physiognomy; as the passions of children are more legibly expressed on their countenances than at a maturer age. This knowledge of physiognomy, which is perhaps only to be acquired at schools, by giving a promptitude of understanding the present approbation or dislike, and the good or bad designs, of those whom we con∣verse with, becomes of hourly use in al∣most every department of life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0025_0FF7A179A682CF78"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VII. ARITHMETIC</HEAD>
<P>LIKE grammar is an abstract science, which is frequently attempted to be taught too early; at the same time it may be ob∣served, that the early initiation of most children into card playing before they come to school, by giving clear and visible ideas of the ten first numerals, seems greatly to facilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; and if this fashionable amusement could be so managed by the parents, who allow it to their children, as not to excite a desire of gain along with a contest of ingenuity, it might be rendered, in some measure, ad∣vantageous by exciting the mind to activi∣ty in this branch of science; but in never∣theless not proper to be used in schools, where its effects on the passions cannot be sufficiently watched, and counteracted.</P>
<P>So much of the science of numbers as is in common use, as the numeration, sub∣traction,
<PB N="25" REF="033601_0026_0FF7A17B4240F338"/>multiplication, and division of money, should be learnt with accuracy; to which should be added the rule of three, and decimal fractions; which will abun∣dantly repay the labour of acquiring them by the pleasure and utility, which will per∣petually result from the knowledge of them thro' life. The higher parts of arithme∣tic, as algebra and fluxions, belong to the abstruser sciences.</P>
<P>There are many introductory books to the science of arithmetic; those I have heard most recommended are Vise's tutor's guide, Hutton's practical arithmetic, and Wingate's arithmetic; but it is probable, that most of the introductory treatises to a∣rithmetic must be nearly of equal excel∣lence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0027_0FF7A17FAEDE8CE8"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VIII. GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<P>SO much of this science, as depends only on memory, may be taught to chil∣dren in their early years. They should be taught to point out on large maps the counties of England, and then the prin∣cipal divisions of Europe, and of the other quarters of the world; and lastly to trace out the principal rivers and mountains, which ingrave or imboss its surface, which is much to be preferred to dissected maps; as it is the situations, rather than the exact forms of counties and of countries, which should be attended to. Afterwards the use of the globes should be explained; and some short outline of astronomy ought to accompany these lectures.</P>
<P>A compendious system of geography on cards, published by Mr. Newberry, in St. Paul's church yard, supplies a very con∣venient
<PB N="27" REF="033601_0028_0FF7A181413F6988"/>method of instructing children. Other geographical cards by Bowles, tho' they only mention the latitude and longi∣tude of important places, may also be used with advantage. The maps, published by Mr. Faden, which have blank outlines to be filled up by the student, are well de∣signed, and not very expensive. The Ab∣be Gaultier's cours de Geographie formed into a game may, like his game at gram∣mar, be rendered amusing to children, and are tolerably well adapted both to pri∣vate families, where there are but few pu∣pils, and to public seminaries of in∣struction.</P>
<P>Fairman's geography, a small octavo sold by Johnson, contains a short account of the planets, and use of the globes. Brooks' gazetteer is an useful work; and some other good geographical publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end of this work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0029_0FF7A182D5443E90"/>
<HEAD>SECTION IX. HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of mankind is connect∣ed with the knowledge of the earth, which they cultivate. A summary of the history of England should precede that of other nations, as it may be more interesting, and more easily comprehended by English children. Afterwards an abridgment of the history of other nations both antient and modern may be collected from various writers, but are some of them already made concise and agreeable by Dr. Goldsmith in his histories of Greece and Rome, as well as of England and Scotland; which how∣ever cannot be well remembered without a previous knowledge of geography, or by consulting maps with every change of place in the account of transactions.</P>
<P>Afterwards a brief, but correct know∣ledge of history still more ancient, and of
<PB N="29" REF="033601_0030_0FF7A18467B5C198"/>chronology, comprehending the four great empires of the world, with the rise of the present kingdoms of Europe from the fall of the last, may be acquired according to the plan of Mrs. Chapone in her letters on the improvement of the mind. This out∣line of history and chronology may be rea∣dily and agreeably learned from Priestley's chart of history; which with his chart of biography should hang amongst a collec∣tion of large well-coloured maps in the parlour of a boarding school, that they may frequently encounter the eyes of the young students.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0031_0FF7A188DD481BE8"/>
<HEAD>SECTION X. NATURAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of the various other animals is also connected with our know∣ledge of the various parts of the earth, which they inhabit. This is termed na∣tural history, and may be taught to chil∣dren earlier than the histories of mankind, as being easier to their comprehensions, and thence more interesting and agreeable to them. Dr. Goldsmith in his history of animated nature has also made this part of knowledge of easy access; and Mr. Bew∣ick's account of quadrupedes, with wood∣prints of the animals, and amusing tale∣pieces to the sections, are quite charming to children. To these should be added a treatise on birds, with the scientific names admirably adapted for the use of schools by Mr. Galton, published by Johnson in St. Paul's church yard, London, in three small volumes. And besides these, children
<PB N="31" REF="033601_0032_0FF7A18A6E5BF738"/>should be permitted occasionally to inspect the collections of foreign animals, which are frequently exhibited in this country; as an examination of the objects themselves conveys clearer ideas than prints and de∣scriptions, and at the same time adds to their knowledge, and gratifies their cu∣riosity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0033_0FF7A18C2AEE3818"/>
<HEAD>SECTION XI. THE RUDIMENTS OF TASTE</HEAD>
<P>ARE too much neglected in most boarding schools; these should be taught with some care, as perhaps peculiarly be∣longing to Ladies; since taste enters into their dress, their motions, their manners, as well as into all the fine arts, which they have leisure to cultivate: as drawing, paint∣ing, modelling, making artificial flowers, embroidery; writing letters, reading, speak∣ing, and into almost every circumstance of life.</P>
<P>The general rudiments of taste are to be acquired first by reading books, which treat professedly on the subject; as the ten papers by Mr. Addison on the power of imagination in the Spectator, vol. 6, No. 411; Akinside's pleasures of imagination; Burke on the sublime and beautiful; Ho∣garth's analysis of beauty; Mason's English
<PB N="33" REF="033601_0034_0FF7A18EC8467438"/>garden; Wheatley's ornamental garden∣ing; and Gilpin's picturesque views. Se∣condly by selecting and explaining admir∣ed passages from classical authors, as the Beauties of Shakespeare, of Johnson, and of Sterne. And lastly, by exhibiting and explaining the prints of beautiful objects, or casts of the best antique gems and me∣dallions.</P>
<P>The authors above mentioned have di∣vided the objects of Taste into the sub∣lime, the beautiful, and the new; but a new sect of inquirers into this subject have lately added the Picturesque; which is supposed to differ from the beautiful by its want of smoothness, and from the sublime from its want of size; but this circumstance has not yet perhaps undergone sufficient examination.—See essay on Picturesque, by U. Price.</P>
<P>Others have endeavoured to make a distinction between beauty and grace; and
<PB N="34" REF="033601_0035_0FF7A19142393E90"/>have esteemed them, as it were, rivals for the possession of the human heart. But Grace may be defined Beauty in action; for a sleeping beauty can not be called graceful, in whatever attitude she may re∣cline; the muscles must be in action to pro∣duce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a graceful motion. The suppos∣ed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired in our early infancy from the curved lines, which form the female bosom, is deliver∣ed in Zoonomia, vol. I. sect. xvi. 6; but is too metaphysical an investigation for young ladies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0036_0FF7A193B9655430"/>
<HEAD>SECTION XII. DRAWING AND EMBROIDERY.</HEAD>
<P>DRAWING as an elegant art be∣longs to the education of young ladies, and greatly facilitates the acquirement of Taste. As this is generally taught by masters, who profess it, I shall only observe, that tho' as an art it consists of deceiving the eye, yet as a science it is capable of producing to the mind the most sublime and beautiful images, or the most interesting scenes of life, for our amusement, admiration, or in∣struction.</P>
<P>The same observation applies to Em∣broidery, which is painting with the needle instead of the pencil, and seems to have been a fashionable employment of ladies of the highest rank in the early ages of the world. As the ladies in polite life have frequently much leisure time at their dis∣posal, it is wise for them to learn many
<PB N="36" REF="033601_0037_0FF7A1954CF7BF78"/>elegant as well as useful arts in their early years; which they may afterward cultivate for their amusement; and thus deprive solitude of irksomeness: And by being able to entertain themselves, they may be less solicitous to enter the circles of dissi∣pation, and depend less for happiness on the caprice of others.</P>
<P>Besides the amusement or accomplish∣ment of possessing the talent of drawing, there is another advantage resulting from it; which consists in using the pencil as a language to express the forms of all visible objects, as of flowers, machines, houses, landscapes; which can not in words alone be conveyed to others with sufficient accu∣racy: For this end it may be sufficient to draw in outlines alone the figures of na∣tural things, without expending so much time on this art, as is requisite to enable the learner to add the nice touches, which form the delicate gradations of shade and colour.</P>

It may be supposed, that some know∣ledge of the science of perspective should be previously acquired for the purpose of drawing the outlines of objects; but I sus∣pect, that this is not always necessary, since at our learning to see; before we have compared the ideas received by the sense of sight with those received by that of touch; any object placed before our eyes, as suppose the face of a companion, must appear a flat coloured or shaded surface, and not a solid substance covered with emi∣nences and depressions; as is so well proved by Bishop Berkley in his theory of vision. Hence if any one could so far unlearn the language of sight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat co∣loured surface only, (as it is really seen) he would draw from nature as easily and exactly, as if he was copying a picture, as the inequalities would appear lights and shades; and he would thus be enabled to take the likeness with much greater facili∣ty and accuracy without the aid of the rules of perspective.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY</HEAD>
<P>IS connected with the study of taste, and should therefore be taught in boarding schools; as without some knowledge of it the works of the painters, statuarists, and poets, both antient and modern, can not be understood. But as a great part of this mythology consists of personified vices, much care should be taken in female schools, as well as in male ones, to prevent any bad impressions, which might be made on the mind by this kind of erudition; this is to be accomplished by explaining the allegorical meaning of many of these supposed actions of heathen deities, and by shewing that they are at present used only as emblems of certain powers, as Mi∣nerva of wisdom, and Bellona of war, and thus constitute the language of painters; and are indeed almost the whole language which that art possesses, besides the delinea∣tion of visible objects in rest or in action.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="033601_0040_0FF7A19CE2250338"/>
These emblems however are not to be so easily acquired by descriptions alone, nor so easily remembered by young pupils; as when prints of antique statues, or me∣dallions, or when cameos, or impressions of antique gems, are at the same time shewn and explained to them. For this purpose the prints of Spence's Polymetis may be exhibited and explained; from which Bell's pantheon is principally ta∣ken: And Dannet's dictionary of mytho∣logy, originally written in French, may be occasionally consulted; and the notes on Mr. Pope's translations of Homer.</P>
<P>There is also a little book intitled, "Instructions sur les Metamorphoses, par M. Le Ragois," which, I am informed is an useful and unexceptionable work for this purpose, containing a kind of summa∣ry of each story of fabulous mythology: to which may be added a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, published by Garth; which I am told, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="40" REF="033601_0041_0FF7A19E6FA7A560"/>work. Much agreeable knowledge of this kind is to be found in Byrant's mythology; Abbe de Pluche's history of the heavens; Warburton's essay on Eleusinian mysteries; to which I beg leave to add the descrip∣tion of the Portland vase in the notes to the first volume of the Botanic garden.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. POLITE LITERATURE</HEAD>
<P>MAY be divided into dissertations, plays, romances, poems; each of which, if the works are properly selected, may af∣ford amusement and instruction to young persons; of some of the books of each of these classes of literature a catalogue will be given at the end of the work.</P>
<P>Such dissertations, as have been gene∣rally admired, may be selected from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, the World, the Rambler, Adventurer, Looker-on, besides many others.</P>
<P>Plays are of three kinds, tragical, sen∣timental, and humourous; of the first, Addison's Cato has been long admired; and the tragedies of Thompson consist of fine language. Of the second kind Cumber∣land's comedies are instances; and of the
<PB N="42" REF="033601_0043_0FF7A1A4B5B396D0"/>third Sheridan's comedies; some of which are entertaining and inoffensive, and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals, or much outrage to their feelings.</P>
<P>There are many plays, which are bet∣ter seen as exhibited on the stage, than as read in the closet; because the objectiona∣ble passages are generally omitted in the representation. But whether young la∣dies should be taught to act plays them∣selves, as is done at some boy's schools, is a matter of doubt. The danger consists in this, lest the acquisition of bolder ac∣tion, and a more elevated voice, should an∣nihilate that retiring modesty, and blush∣ing embarrassment, to which young ladies owe one of their most powerful external charms.</P>
<P>If young ladies act plays amongst them∣selves only, or without admitting more than two or three of their friends or pa∣rents;
<PB N="43" REF="033601_0044_0FF7A1A647FB5D90"/>or if they repeat chosen scenes of plays, or speeches only, much of the above objection ceases, and some advantages may result to their attitudes or enunciation. Madam de Genlis' Theatre d'Education affords the least exceptionable whole plays, with the sacred dramas of Miss Moore, and of Metastasio.</P>
<P N="3">3. Novels or romances may be divid∣ed into the serious, the humourous, and the amorous. Of these, the last should be intirely interdicted; but the first, when well managed, may convey instruction in the most agreeable and forcible manner: Such as Mr. Day's Sandford and Merton. The Children's Friend. Tales of the Cas∣tle. Robinson Crusoe. Edward, by the author of Zelucco. And to these may be added some other modern novels, the pro∣ductions of ingenious ladies, which are I believe less objectionable than many others; as the Evelina, Cecilia, and Ca∣milla of Miss Burney. The Emmeline
<PB N="44" REF="033601_0045_0FF7A1A7D71489F0"/>and Ethelinda of Charlotte Smith; Inch∣bald's simple story; Mrs. Brook's Emily Montague; and the female Quixote; all which I have here introduced from the character given to me of them by a very ingenious lady; not having myself read them with sufficient attention. And last∣ly, the humorous novels, which are not written to inflame the passions, convey in∣struction, as far as they are imitations of real life: Of these are Le Sage's famous novel of Gil Blas; and Fielding's Tom Jones; neither of which however are pro∣per books for young readers.</P>
<P>There are many, who condemn the use of novels altogether; but what are epic po∣ems but novels in verse?—It is difficult to draw the line of limit between novels, and other works of imagination; unless the word novel be confined to mean only the romances of love and chivalry.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that almost all novels, as well as plays, and epic poems, have some
<PB N="45" REF="033601_0046_0FF7A1AA5DC1AD00"/>exceptional passages to be found in them; which might therefore be expunged, be∣fore they are allowed to be read by young ladies. But are young women therefore to be kept in intire ignorance of mankind, with whom they must shortly associate, and from whom they are frequently to choose a partner for life? This would be making them the slaves rather than the companions of men, like the Sultanas of a Turkish Seraglio. And how can young women, who are secluded from the other sex from their infancy, form any judgment of men, if they are not to be assisted by such books, as delineate manners?—A lady of fortune, who was persuaded by her guar∣dian to marry a disagreeable and selfish man, speaking to her friend of the ill humour of her husband, lamented, that she had been prohibited from reading novels. <Q>If I had read such books, said she, before I was married, I should have chosen bet∣ter; I was told, that all men were alike except in respect to fortune.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="033601_0047_0FF7A1ACE0E19E28"/>
We must however observe, that novels are perhaps more objectionable in schools than in private education; as the com∣ments of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community: And as they are more amusing to young people than any other books, if read too early, they may give a distaste to more useful knowledge; which are good reasons for the total prohi∣bition of them in schools: And in private education, lest a preference of fiction to truth should be thus instilled, the ridicu∣lous passages, with which even the best no∣vels abound, should be carefully pointed out by a friend or governess: with their exaggerations, improbabilities, and fre∣quent deviations from nature.</P>
<P>There are indeed few books, which delineate manners, whether in prose or poetry, however well chosen, which have not some objectionable passages in them. In reading the fables of Esop, Mr. Rousseau well observes, that the effect
<PB N="47" REF="033601_0048_0FF7A1AF774C4BB8"/>on the mind may frequently be totally dif∣ferent from that designed by the author; as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow, and gains the piece of cheese, the moral was designed to shew the folly of at∣tending to flatterers; but may equally be supposed to applaud the cunning of the fox or flatterer, who is rewarded. In the popular narrative of Robinson Crusoe a childish superstition concerning intima∣tions of future events, somewhat like the second sight of the highlands of Scotland, is frequently inculcated; and the use of rum or brandy is proposed as an infallible cure in all maladies; which however I am told is corrected in the new Robinson Crusoe.</P>
<P>Pamela, and Joseph Andrews, and Cla∣rissa Harlow, are recommended by Ma∣dame de Genlis, and by Mrs. Macawley.— Madame de Genlis in a note in one of her works gives her reason for recommending Richardson's novels; because his heroines
<PB N="48" REF="033601_0049_0FF7A1B10993EF50"/>retain a more considerable degree of com∣mand over their affections than those of apparently less exceptionable romances. In this respect a novel called "Plain Sense," lately published by Lane, and written by an ingenious Cheshire lady, claims the preference to all others, and ap∣pears to me to carry this idea to excess.</P>
<P>The works of Richardson are never∣theless not only too voluminous, and thence would consume too much time, which might be better employed in schools: but in these, and even in Mr. Pope's rape of the lock, and his Eloisa to Abelard, many objectionable passages of another kind may be discovered. If these passages, from which so few books are totally exempt, were expunged, it might raise curiosity, and induce young people to examine dif∣ferent copies of the same work, and to seek for other improper books themselves; it is therefore perhaps better, when these books are read to a governess, that
<PB N="49" REF="033601_0050_0FF7A1B2B4BE6D18"/>she should express disapprobation in a plain and quiet way, of such passages, ra∣ther than to expunge them; which would give a feeling of dislike to the pupil, and confirm her delicacy, rather than give im∣purity to her ideas.</P>
<P>Much therefore depends on the con∣duct of the governess in this respect, so long as they are under the eye of a judi∣cious monitor, no real harm could proba∣bly arise from their seeing human nature in all the classes of life, not only as it should be, or as it may be imagined to be, but as it really exists, since without comparison there can be no judgment, and consequent∣ly no real knowledge.</P>
<P>It must nevertheless be observed, that the excessive study of novels is universally an ill employment at any time of life; not only because such readers are liable to ac∣quire a romantic taste; and to return from the flowery scenes of fiction to the com∣mon
<PB N="50" REF="033601_0051_0FF7A1B7552ADA90"/>duties of life with a degree of regret; but because the high-wrought scenes of elegant distress displayed in novels have been found to blunt the feelings of such readers towards real objects of misery; which awaken only disgust in their minds instead of sentiments of pity or benevo∣lence.</P>
<P N="4">4. The works of the poets, as well as those of the writers of novels, require to be selected with great caution. The same may be said of painting, sculpture, and music; which by delighting the imagina∣tion influence the judgment, and may thence be employed either to good or bad purposes: But as poetry, when thus select∣ed, like painting, sculpture, and music, its rival sisters, is an object of refined taste, and affords an elegant amusement at least, it so far belongs to the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>Gay's fables, Thomson's seasons, Gis∣borne's walk in a forest, are proper for the
<PB N="51" REF="033601_0052_0FF7A1B8E6CC9A18"/>younger classes of pupils; afterwards Pope's Ethic epistles, and essay on man, Gold-smith's poems, Akinside, Mason, Gray, and others, which are enumerated in the catalogue. I forbear to mention the Bo∣tanic garden; as some ladies have intimat∣ed to me, that the Loves of the plants are described in too glowing colours; but as the descriptions are in general of female forms in graceful attitudes, the objection is less forcible in respect to female readers. And besides the celebrated poets of our own country, as Milton and Shakespeare, tran∣slations from the antients, as from Homer and Virgil; and from the more modern poems of Tasso, and Camoens, may be read with pleasure and improvement, tho' some objectionable passages may perhaps be found in all of them.</P>
<P N="5">5. For the purpose of forming a style in writing, a few well-chosen books should be read often over; till the ear acquires, as it were, the musick of the sentences;
<PB N="52" REF="033601_0053_0FF7A1BA89CB1098"/>and the imagination is thus enabled to co∣py it in our own compositions; such as those papers of the Spectator, which are ascribed to Addison, and are terminated with a capital letter of the word Clio; or some of Lady Wortley Montague's letters from Turkey; or other works of chaste, distinct, and expressive style, not overload∣ed with metaphors, which with superabun∣dance of ornament injure perspicuity.</P>
<P>But for other purposes of education it is perhaps better to teach young people select parts of many books, than a few en∣tire ones; not only because the pupils will thus be acquainted with more authors in fashionable literature; but because the business of polite education is to give the outlines of many species of erudition, or branches of knowledge; which the young ladies may cultivate further at their future leisure without the assistance of a teacher, as may best suit their tastes or their situa∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033601_0054_0FF7A1BD152ED618"/>
I cannot conclude this section on po∣lite learning without mentioning, that some illiterate men have condemned the cultivation of the minds of the female sex, and have called such in ridicule learned ladies; as if it was a reproach to render themselves agreeable and useful. Where affectation is joined with learning, it be∣comes pedantry, but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to the cultivated; as is so well elucidated in "Letters to literary ladies," a small duodecimo published by Johnson, and written by one of the inge∣nious family of E—in Ireland.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV. ARTS AND SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the acquisition of gram∣mar, languages, and common arithmetic; and besides a knowledge of geography, ci∣vil history, and natural history, there are other sciences, an outline of which might be taught to young ladies of the higher classes of the school, or of more inquiring minds, before or after they leave school; which might not only afford them present amusement, but might enable them at any future time to prosecute any of them fur∣ther, if inclination and opportunity should coincide; and, by enlarging their sphere of taste and knowledge, would occasion them to be interested in the conversation of a greater number and of more ingenious men, and to interest them by their own conversation in return.</P>
<P N="1">1. An outline of Botany may be learnt from Lee's introduction to botany, and
<PB N="55" REF="033601_0056_0FF7A1C2148F3AB8"/>from the translations of the works of Lin∣naeus by a society at Lichfield; to which might be added Curtis's botanical maga∣zine, which is a beautiful work, and of no great expence. But there is a new treatise introductory to botany called Botanic dia∣logues for the use of schools, well adapted to this purpose, written by M. E. Jacson, a lady well skilled in botany, and publish∣ed by Johnson, London. And lastly I shall not forbear to mention, that the philo∣sophical part of botany may be agreeably learnt from the notes to the second volume of the Botanic garden, whether the poetry be read or not.</P>
<P N="2">2. An outline of Chemistry, which surprizes and enchants us, may be learnt from the Elements of chemistry by La∣voisier, originally published in French; to which may be added a small work of Fourcroy called the philosophy of Chemis∣try. The former of these illustrious che∣mists perished by the guillotine, an irre∣parable loss to science and to mankind!</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="033601_0057_0FF7A1C3A2C2D1A8"/>
The acquirement of Chemistry should be preceded by a sketch of Mineralogy; which is not only an interesting branch of science, as it teaches the knowledge of dia∣monds and precious stones, and of the va∣rious mines of metals, coals, and salt; but because it explains also the difference of soils, and is thus concerned in the theory and practice of agriculture: But there is at present no proper introductory book, that I know of, on this subject for the use of children; as Cronstedt's and Bergman's, and Kirwan's mineralogy are too exact and prolix; nor could be well understood with∣out a small collection of fossils.</P>
<P N="3">3. An outline of the sciences, to which Mathematics have generally been applied, as of astronomy, mechanics, hydrostatics, and optics, with the curious addition of electricity and magnetism, may best be ac∣quired by attending the lectures in experi∣mental philosophy, which are occasion∣ally exhibited by itinerant philosophers;
<PB N="57" REF="033601_0058_0FF7A1C5386EEA28"/>and which have almost exclusively acquir∣ed the name of natural philosophy.</P>
<P>The books in common use for teaching these sciences are too difficult and abstruse for the study of young persons. Some parts of natural philosophy are rendered not unentertaining in the notes of the first volume of the Botanic garden, as the the∣ory of meteors, and of winds; and an ac∣count of the strata of the earth; which nevertheless require too much attention for very young ladies; but may be read with pleasure after leaving school by those, who possess inquiring minds. It is to be wished that some writer of juvenile books would endeavour easily to explain the structure and use of the barometer, and thermometer, and of clocks and watches, which supply a part of the furniture of our houses, and of our pockets.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the same manner the various arts and manufactories, which adorn and
<PB N="58" REF="033601_0059_0FF7A1C9988FFE90"/>enrich this country, should occasionally be shewn and explained to young persons, as so many ingenious parts of experimental philosophy; as well as from their imme∣diately contributing to the convenience of life, and to the wealth of the nations, which have invented or established them. Of these are the cotton works on the river Derwent in Derbyshire; the potteries in Staffordshire; the iron-founderies of Coal∣brooke Dale in Shropshire; the manufac∣tories of Birmingham, Manchester, Not∣tingham; but these are not in the province of a boarding school, but might be advan∣tageously exhibited to young ladies by their parents in the summer vacations.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this section of arts and sciences it may be proper to mention the art of producing a technical memory invented by Mr. Gray; which may be readily ac∣quired by consulting his book, and may perhaps be of advantage in remembering dates or numbers; as they are expressed
<PB N="59" REF="033601_0060_0FF7A1CB2658BDF0"/>by letters, and formed into words. This work I attended to in my youth, but found it an amusing trick, rather than an useful art.</P>
<P N="6">6. The art of writing Short-hand, which is said to be of English invention, should also be mentioned in this place. The book I learned this art from was pub∣lished by Gurney, and said to be an im∣provement on Mason; other treatises of short-hand I have also examined, but found them all nearly of equal excellence. I can only add, that many volumes, which I wrote from medical lectures, I now find difficult to decypher; and that as the words in short-hand are spelt from their sound only; those scholars, who practise this art early in life, are liable not afterwards to spell our language correctly; and lastly, that I believe, this art is still capable of improvement by first forming a more ac∣curate alphabet, than that in common use among all European nations.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="60" REF="033601_0061_0FF7A1CCB57AB450"/>
7. This section on arts and sciences may perhaps be thought to include more branches of them, than is necessary for fe∣male erudition. But as in male education the tedicus acquirement of antient lan∣guages for the purpose of studying poetry and oratory is gradually giving way to the more useful cultivation of modern sciences, it may be of advantage to ladies of the ris∣ing generation to acquire an outline of si∣milar knowledge; as they are in future life to become companions; and one of the greatest pleasures received in conversation consists in being reciprocally well under∣stood. Botany is already a fashionable study for ladies; and chemistry is ingeniously re∣commended to them in the Letters to lite∣rary ladies.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVI. MORALS.</HEAD>
<P>THE criterion of moral duties has been variously delivered by different wri∣ters: Expediency, by which is meant whatever increases the sum of public hap∣piness, is by some called the criterion of virtue; and whatever diminishes that sum is termed vice. By others the happiness or misery of the individual, if rightly un∣derstood, is said to be the bond of moral obligation. And lastly, by others the will of God is said to constitute the sole crite∣rion of virtue and vice.</P>
<P>But besides systematic books of morali∣ty, which are generally too abstruse for young minds, morals may be divided into five departments for the greater convenien∣cy of the manner of instruction.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="62" REF="033601_0063_0FF7A1D2C8537C28"/>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>A SYMPATHY with the pains and pleasures of others is the foundation of all our social virtues. "DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY," is a precept which descended from heaven. Whoever feels pain him∣self, when he sees others affected with it, will not only never be liable to give pain, but will always be inclined to relieve it. The lady, who possesses this christian vir∣tue of compassion, cannot but be a good daughter, a good wife, and a good mother, that is, an amiable character in every de∣partment of life.</P>
<P>The manner of communicating this benevolent sympathy to children consists in expressing our own sympathy, when any thing cruel presents itself; as in the de∣struction of an insect; or when actions of
<PB N="64" REF="033601_0065_0FF7A1D5E3D03680"/>cruelty are related in books or in conversa∣tion. I once observed a lady with appa∣rent expressions of sympathy say to her lit∣tle daughter, who was pulling off the legs of a fly, <Q>how should you like to have your arms and legs pulled off? would it not give you great pain? pray let it fly away out of the window:</Q> which I doubt not would make an indelible impression on the child, and lay the foundation of an amiable character.</P>
<P>This virtue of compassion is a certain foundation of benevolence; and on that account renders children good to their own parents in the latter part of their lives, as well as to all other people; an important circumstance to the happiness of our latter years! Where cruelty or malevolence resides in the breast, it is generally exercis∣ed most by the child upon the aged parent, with whom in civilized society he frequent∣ly resides; and who often lives so long as to stand in his way to the possession of a wished-for inheritance.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="033601_0066_0FF7A1D773611F38"/>
This compassion, or sympathy with the pains of others, ought also to extend to the brute creation, as far as our necessities will admit; for we cannot exist long without the destruction of other animal or vegetable beings either in their nature or embryon state. Such is the condition of mortality, that the first law of nature is "eat, or be eaten." Hence for the preservation of our existence we may be supposed to have a natural right to kill those brute creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat us; but to destroy even insects wantonly shews an unreflecting mind, or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>A young gentleman once assured me, that he had lately fallen in love with a young lady; but, on their walking out one evening in summer, she took two or three steps out of her way on the gravel walk to tread upon an insect; and that afterwards whenever the idea of her came into his mind, it was attended with this picture of
<PB N="66" REF="033601_0067_0FF7A1DB1B04CF20"/>active cruelty; till that of the lady ceased to be agreeable, and he relinquished his design of courtship.</P>
<P>Nevertheless this sympathy, however amiable and necessary, may be carried to an extreme, so as to render miserable the person, who possesses it; since many piti∣able objects must be seen in our journey through life, which we have not power to relieve. This then furnishes us with a barrier or line, where to stop; that is, we should endeavour to render our little pu∣pils alive to sympathize with all remedia∣ble evils; and at the same time to arm them with fortitude to bear the sight of such irremediable evils, as the accidents of life must frequently present before their eyes.</P>
<P>There should also be a plan in schools to promote the habit as well as the prin∣ciple of benevolence; each young lady might occasionally contribute a small sum
<PB N="67" REF="033601_0068_0FF7A1DDAAD59768"/>on seeing a needy naked child to purchase flannel or coarse linen for clothes, which they might learn to cut out, and to make up themselves; and thus the practice of in∣dustry might be united with that of libe∣rality.</P>
<P>Another still more practical mode of producing a habit of benevolence in chil∣dren might be by inducing them to em∣ploy some leisure hours in little works of taste, as in making artificial flowers, purses, fringes, and bestowing these on poor peo∣ple, in order that they might sell them for their support. Miss Hartley at Bath, the daughter of the great medical philosopher of that name, has lately exhibited an amia∣ble example of this kind of philanthropy; she has been long distinguished by her ta∣lents as an artist in painting; and has late∣ly distributed her elegant performances among the poor famished emigrants, who reside in her neighbourhood; who are thus greatly assisted by the sale of her works.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="033601_0069_0FF7A1DF436439A0"/>
Another channel, in which this sym∣pathy should be taught to flow, is in the observance of those attentions, which per∣petually diffuse happiness by promoting by courtesy of behaviour the cheerfulness, or forwarding by ready assistance the interests of those, whether equals, inferiors, or su∣periors; with whom every one happens to associate or reside: which constitutes the essential part of what is termed politeness of manners; and universally indicates a benevolent disposition.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. VERACITY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the purpose of inculcating a love of truth early in life the love of praise supplies the most certain means. This kind of honour has an honest pride for it's basis: a story is related in one of the mo∣dern volumes of the universal history of an inhabitant of Constantinople, who was brought to the scaffold for denying the divine mission of Mahomet; and on hav∣ing a pardon offered him, if he would then declare his error, answered, that he would not speak an untruth to save his life. And, I think, it is recorded, that one of the fathers of the church used to affirm, that he would not tell a lie, were he sure to gain heaven by it.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="033601_0071_0FF7A1E586BE3628"/>
I once heard an ingenious lady say to a company of her friends, that her daugh∣ter, a young girl, who stood by with a countenance flushed with pleasure, never told her a lie in her life: This happy use of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity, which would never be destroyed by interested motives.</P>
<P>The disgrace of telling a lie should be painted in vivid colours, as totally de∣structive of the character of a lady or gen∣tleman, rendering them contemptible in the eyes of the world: And the inconve∣nience of this detestable habit of lying should be explained from its preventing their being believed, when they wish it; as is exemplified in the fable of the shepherd-boy; who called out "the wolf, the wolf," so often to alarm his neighbours, and thus to amuse himself, when no wolf was near; that when the real wolf attacked his flock, he could by no vociferation prevail on any
<PB N="71" REF="033601_0072_0FF7A1E714D24AB0"/>one to come to his assistance: Or like the village-drunkard, who frequently a∣mused himself with crying out "fire," along the streets on his return from the ale-house in the night, to the great alarm of the neighbourhood; till at length, when his cottage was really in flames, his distress was not believed, and he could gain no assistance to extinguish them.</P>
<P>This sincerity of character should be confirmed by the example of the gover∣nesses, who should themselves pay the most exact and scrupulous attention to truth; they should not exaggerate trifling errors into reprehensible faults; and, where re∣proof is necessary, should give it with kind∣ness; and should not only punctually ful∣fil their own promises, tho' to their incon∣venience, but exact the same from their pupils in return.</P>
<P>To these should be added the precepts of religion, as soon as their minds are ca∣pable
<PB N="72" REF="033601_0073_0FF7A1E8F09783A0"/>of receiving them, which uniformly inculcate truth and probity in all our words and actions.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. PRUDENCE, JUSTICE, CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE impressions on the mind made by recent examples placed, as it were, be∣fore our eyes have so much more durable effects, than the more abstracted ideas de∣livered in systems of moral philosophy; that I believe the most efficacious method of inculcating the virtue of prudence in respect to their own conduct is by telling young people the ill consequences, which have lately happened to others; whose per∣sons or names they are acquainted with: so that a repetition of the slander of a town, which always degrades the retailers, has sometimes its advantage as a lesson to the hearers.</P>
<P>There is another kind of prudence, which it is necessary to acquire in some de∣gree,
<PB N="74" REF="033601_0075_0FF7A1EECDAAB010"/>which arms the possessor against the ill designs of others; hence they should be taught to beware of flatterers, gamesters, drunkards, and of all ill-tempered persons. As this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind, such books as the maxims of Rochfoucault, and others, might be recommended; but they give too gloo∣my a picture of human nature to be put in∣to the hands of young ladies.</P>
<P>"Know yourself" is a celebrated in∣junction, and may constitute one depart∣ment of Prudence, when any one under∣takes some great action, or great change in the condition of life; but "know other people" is equally necessary in passing along this sublunary world, and may be inserted with propriety as another maxim in the code of prudence. The facility of know∣ing others in the daily intercourse of the world is produced by the knowledge of physiognomy, acquired at schools in early life; while the passions continue to be im∣pressed
<PB N="75" REF="033601_0076_0FF7A1F05B06F9D0"/>on the countenances of children; and which is never so well acquired in pri∣vate tuition; and thus constitutes one of the great advantages of school-education.</P>
<P>JUSTICE and CHASTITY, which are the principal links, by which civilized society is held together, are to be inculcated in young minds by similar methods; that is by pointing out by examples the public punishment, or public disgrace, which cer∣tainly accompanies the breach of either of these important duties: and afterwards to add the precepts of religion, when their minds are capable of perceiving their force, to co-operate with the effect of the laws of society, and of the opinion of the wise and virtuous.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XX. FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>IF female children are not treated with tenderness by a mother in their early years of infancy, they are perhaps liable to acquire a harshness of character, and an ap∣parent unfeelingness, which afterwards renders them less amiable; though it may give them greater fortitude; which should therefore be inculcated at their rather ma∣turer years.</P>
<P>Neither the robust assailing courage, which prompts to the performance of he∣roic actions, nor the ostentatious patience, which requires the flattery of the public eye, for its support, belong to the female character. But that serene strength of mind, which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes, prepared to counteract or
<PB N="77" REF="033601_0078_0FF7A1F49561EC38"/>to bear the necessary evils of life, is equal∣ly valuable as a male or female acquisition. This is termed presence of mind; it de∣pends on our judgment of the real value of things; and on our application of those causes, which contribute to turn disagreea∣ble circumstances to the best advantage; and can therefore only be acquired by the general cultivation of good sense and of knowledge.</P>
<P>An occasional effusion of tears has been thought an amiable weakness, and a mark of delicacy of the sex. When tears are shed at the irremediable misfortunes of others, it indicates an amiable sensibility; but when young ladies indulge themselves in a promptitude of dissolving into inces∣sant tears at every trivial distress of their own, it shews a kind of infantine debility of mind, and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common duties of life; and should therefore be discouraged by reason∣ing on the kind and quantity of the evil,
<PB N="78" REF="033601_0079_0FF7A1F71716E768"/>which disturbs them; and by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others in disasters much more calamit∣ous, of which there are examples in the letters of Lady Russel: And lastly by re∣minding them of the consolations of reli∣gion.</P>
<P>A slight appearance of timidity has been esteemed another mark of delicacy of the sex; but timidity is the companion of debility of mind rather than of delica∣cy, and should not therefore be encoura∣ged. In respect to the expressions of fear the violent cries and distorted countenan∣ces of some ladies in situations of danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes; while they increase the confusion, and may be said "to help the storm;" but if to these be added an affectation of fear without cause; as when a young lady screams through the whole gamut at the sight of a spider, or a grass-hopper; the fault becomes voluntary, and should be
<PB N="79" REF="033601_0080_0FF7A1F99195C520"/>opposed and conquered by the shafts of ridicule.</P>
<P>Impudence in common language has been termed boldness; and bashfulness has been ascribed to timidity; but neither of them with sufficient precision; as brave men have been known to be bashful, and cowards impudent. Assurance of counte∣nance arises from the possessor of it rather over-valuing his own abilities; and impu∣dence consists in this assurance with a to∣tal disregard of the opinions of others; but neither of them bear any analogy to fortitude. On the other hand modesty arises from the possessor of it rather under∣valuing his own abilities; and bashfulness consists in this modesty with great solici∣tude about the opinions of others; but nei∣ther of them are attended with personal fear. So charming is the appearance of this great sensibility by adding a blush to the features of beauty, that no endeavours should be used to extinguish it early in
<PB N="80" REF="033601_0081_0FF7A1FB201BBDE8"/>life. Nor should any means be contrived to increase it to excess, as embarrassment both of thought and action, and even im∣pediment of speech, is then liable to at∣tend the great anxiety it occasions.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXI. TEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>INCLUDES the subjugation of the appetites and passions to reason and prudence; it consists in our moderation in the use of all those things, which con∣tribute to the convenience, comfort, or en∣joyment of life; as of food, dress, plea∣sures; and in the restraining our licenti∣ous passions, as of anger, vanity, love, am∣bition. The method to instil this virtue is by exhibiting the various inconvenien∣ces, which attend unlimited indulgence; and thus to inculcate the golden rule of "nothing to excess."</P>
<P>The example of the governess will have great effect in producing many of the
<PB N="82" REF="033601_0083_0FF7A2000E9421C8"/>virtues above mentioned in the minds of her pupils. Justice in the most trivial circumstance must be carefully and exact∣ly done between children in respect to each other in their little disputes at play. Moderation and self-government should al∣so constantly appear in the characters of those, who are to teach these virtues to others.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THE precepts of religion are best taught by requiring the young pupils regu∣larly to attend such places of divine worship as their parents direct; and by reading on Sundays select parts of the holy scriptures, and some approved books of sermons; as those of Blair, and a few others; and by inculating the reasonableness of daily thanksgiving, and the duty of daily pray∣er, to the great author of all good.</P>
<P>The divine morality delivered in the new testament should be repeatedly incul∣cated to an infant audience, who cannot so well understand the metaphysical parts of religion, such as the duty of doing to others
<PB N="84" REF="033601_0085_0FF7A20419F95678"/>as we would they should do unto us: to love our neighbours as ourselves: to for∣give injuries, not to revenge them: and to be kind even to our enemies. For this purpose the sermons of the old Whole du∣ty of man are recommended; one of which might be read every Sunday evening.</P>
<P>Ladies of more mature years, or who have finished their school-education, may learn the necessity and usefulness of our ex∣cellent religion from Baron Haller's letters to his daughter, from Lady Pennington's advice to her daughter, and lastly from Mr. Gisborne's duties of the female sex: and the defence of the truth of it may be learn∣ed from Mr. Payley's evidences of christi∣anity; but perhaps it is better for them not to perplex their minds with many works of religious controversy.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIII. ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a fascinating manner in the address of some people, which almost instantly conciliates the good will, and even the confidence of their acquaintance. Ma∣chiavel in his history of Castruccio Castri∣cani observes; that his hero could assume such openness of countenance; that though he was known to be a man practised in every kind of fraud and treachery, yet in a few minutes he gained the confidence of all, whom he conversed with; they went away satisfied of his good will towards them, and were betrayed to their ruin.</P>
<P>This enviable address, which may be used for good purposes as well as for bad ones, may be difficult to analize; but may possibly consist simply in a countenance ani∣mated
<PB N="86" REF="033601_0087_0FF7A209368E6670"/>with pleasure at meeting and con∣versing with our acquaintance; and which diffuses cheerfulness by pleasurable conta∣gion into the bosoms of others; and thus in∣terests them in our behalf. It is not the smile of flattery, nor the smile of self-ap∣probation, nor the smile of habit, nor of le∣vity; but it is simply an expression of plea∣sure, which seems to arise at the fight of our acquaintance; and which persuades them, that they possess our love, and for which they barter their own in return.</P>
<P>However this conciliating manner may have been used, as above related, for bad pur∣poses; it probably proceeded originally from friendliness and openness of heart, with cheerful benevolence; and that in those, who have in process of time become bad characters, the appearance of those vir∣tues has remained, after the reality of them has vanished. What then is the method, by which this inchantment of countenance can be taught? certainly by instilling cheer∣fulness
<PB N="87" REF="033601_0088_0FF77E8DE46759E8"/>and benevolence into the minds of young ladies early in life, and at the same time an animation of countenance in ex∣pressing them; and though this pleasurable animation be at first only copied, it will in time have the appearance of being natural; and will contribute to produce by associa∣tion the very cheerfulness and benevolence, which it at first only imitated. This is a golden observation to those, who have the care of young children.</P>
<P>A very accomplished lady, who read the manuscript of this work, wrote the sol∣lowing with her pencil on the opposite page; "nothing can be more just and interesting than the whole of this section; yet however desirable it may be to mend an unpleasant <HI>abord,</HI> might one not suspect, since Nature has produced a diversity of manner, that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful∣ness on a grave set of features might produce the worst of evil affectations? A natural sim∣plicity of manner, whether serious or gay,
<PB N="88" REF="033601_0089_0FF7A20E38CF1740"/>will always please; and probably this amia∣ble address may be rendered equally consist∣ent with natural manners, whether serious or gay?"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIV. CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the winning manners above described, the art of pleasing in conversa∣tion seems to consist in two things; one of them to hear well; and the other to speak well. The perpetual appearance of attention, and the varying expression of the countenance of the hearer to the sentiments or passions of the speaker; is a principal charm in con∣versation; to be well heard and accurately understood encourages our companions to proceed with pleasure, whatever may be the topics of their discourse.</P>
<P>Those, who have been educated at schools, and have learnt the knowledge of physiognomy from their playfellows in their early years, understand the pleasurable or painful fellings of all with whom they com∣verse,
<PB N="90" REF="033601_0091_0FF7A2124EADB4A8"/>often even before their words are fi∣nished; and, by thus immediately conform∣ing the expression of their own features to the sensations of the speaker, become the interesting and animated companions a∣bove described, which is seldom seen in those educated in private families; and which, as before observed, gives a pre∣ference to school-education.</P>
<P>To speak agreeably in respect to manner consists in a voice clear, yet not loud, soft, yet not plaintive; with dis∣tinct articulation, and with graceful atti∣tudes rather than with graceful actions; as almost every kind of gesticulation is disagreeable. In respect to the matter it should be such as coincides with the tastes or pursuits of those, to whom the conversation is addressed. From hence it will appear, that both to hear well, and to speak well, requires an extensive knowledge of things, as well as of the tastes and pursuits of mankind; and must
<PB N="91" REF="033601_0092_0FF7A214D2855540"/>therefore ultimately be the effect of a good education in general, rather than a particular article of it.</P>
<P>There are however faults to be a∣voided, and cautious to be observed, in the conversation of young ladies; which should be pointed out to them by the go∣verness of a boarding school. Of these I shall mention first, that whenever the thirst of shining in conversation seizes on the heart, the vanity of the speaker be∣comes apparent; and we are disgusted with the manner, whatever may be the matter of the discourse.</P>
<P>Secondly, that it is always childish, and generally ridiculous, when young people boast of their follies, or when they accuse themselves of virtues; nei∣ther of which they probably possess in the degree, which they describe. A young lady was heard to say, "I am frightened to death at the sight of a
<PB N="92" REF="033601_0093_0FF7A2165F9AFCF8"/>bird:" And another, that she was so in∣considerate, as to give her money to the poor naked children, whom she saw in the streets in winter.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they should be apprized, that there is danger in speaking ill even of a bad person; both because they may have been misinformed, and because they should judge their neighbours with charity. A friend of mine was once asked by a young man, how he could distinguish, whether the lady, whom he meant to address, was good tempered; and gave this answer. "When any du∣bious accusation is brought in conversa∣tion against an absent person; if she al∣ways inclines to believe the worst side of the question, she is ill-tempered." There are some nice distinctions on this subject of good nature delivered in Lady Pen∣nington's advice to her daughters, which are worth a young lady's attention.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="033601_0094_0FF7A218F72B36F8"/>
Fourthly, that it is dangerous for a young lady to speak very highly in praise even of a deserving man; for if she ex∣tols his actions, she will seem to give her∣self the importance of a judge, and her determinations will sometimes be called in question; and to commend highly the person of a man is in general estimation inconsistent with the delicacy of the sex at any age.</P>
<P>Fifthly, young ladies should be ad∣vised not to accustom themselves to the use of strong asseverations, or of a kind of petty oaths, such as "upon my ho∣nour," in their conversation; nor often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm; since all such strong expres∣sions and appeals derogate somewhat from the character of the speaker: as they give an intimation, that she has not been usually believed on her simple as∣sertion.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="033601_0095_0FF7A2DB8F349FB8"/>
Sixthly, laughing vehemently aloud, or tittering with short shrieks, in which some young ladies, who have left school, indulge themselves at cards or other a∣musements, are reprehensible; as their dignity of character must suffer by appear∣ing too violently agitated at trivial circum∣stances.</P>
<P>Seventhly, and uniform adherence to sincerity in conversation is of the first im∣portance; as without it our words are but empty sounds, and can no more interest our companions than the tinkling of a bell. No artificial polish of manners can com∣pensate for the apparent want of this vir∣tue, nor any acquirements of knowledge for the reality of the want of it. Hence though the excess of blame or praise of the actions of others may be imprudent or im∣proper in the conversation of young la∣dies; as mentioned in the third and fourth articles of this section; yet in these, as in all other kinds of conversation, their opini∣ons
<PB N="95" REF="033601_0096_0FF77EB1B561AA28"/>should be given with truth, if given at all; but when the character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are concerned, they should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with diffidence and modesty.</P>
<P>Lastly, if at any time any improper dis∣course should be addressed to young ladies, which has a tendency to indecency, im∣morality, or irreligion, they should be taught to express a marked disapprobation both in words and countenance. So great is the power of the soster sex in meliora∣ting the characters of men; that, if such was their uniform behaviour, I doubt not, but that it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age; an event de∣voutly to be wished, and which would con∣tribute much to their own happiness.</P>
<P>To these might be added many other observations from the writers on female education concerning a due respect in conversation to superiors, good temper to
<PB N="96" REF="033601_0097_0FF77EB34F954200"/>equals, and condescension to inferiors. But as young ladies are not expected to speak with the wisdom, or precision of philosophers; and as the careless cheerful∣ness of their conversation, with simplicity of manner, and with the grace, ease, and vivacity natural to youth, supplies it with its principal charms; these should be par∣ticularly encouraged, as there are few ar∣tificial accomplishments, which could com∣pensate for the loss of them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXV. EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE acquirements of literature, and of many arts, make the lives of young peo∣ple too sedentary; which impairs their strength, makes their countenances pale and bloated, and lays the foundation of many diseases; hence some hours should every day be appropriated to bodily exer∣cises, and to relaxation of mind.</P>
<P>Such as tend to produce activity, and to promote the growth of the person in res∣pect to height, are preferred in the schools for young ladies to those, which render the system more robust and muscular.</P>
<P>Of these playing at ball, at shuttlecock, swinging as they sit on a cord or cushion,
<PB N="98" REF="033601_0099_0FF77EC355D38640"/>and dancing, in the open air in summer, and within doors in winter, are to be pre∣ferred. To these some have recommend∣ed an exercise of the arms by swinging lead∣en weights, which are called dumb bells; these should be very light, if they be used at all, otherwise they load the spine of the back, and render the shoulders thick and muscular, and rather impede than forward the perpendicular growth of the person. The ringing of a real bell hung as is done in churches, or the frequent drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley, with a fly-wheel to prevent its too hasty descent, would be an exercise, which might be used with great advantage by young people; as it both extends the spine, and strengthens the muscles of the chest and arms.</P>
<P>Many other kinds of exercise have been recommended by authors: Madame Gen∣lis advises weights to be carried on the head, as milk-maids carry their milk-pails;
<PB N="99" REF="033601_0100_0FF77F589DDEB2B0"/>and even to add weights to the soles of the shoes of children to strengthen, as she sup∣poses, the muscles of locomotion in walk∣ing or running. It is evident, that carry∣ing weights on the head must be injurious to young people, especially when there is a tendency to softness of the bones; as it may contribute to bend the spine by their pressure, and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body; and the walking in weighted shoes may induce awkward ges∣tures without any adequate advantage.</P>
<P>There are other modes of exertion, which, though graceful in themselves, are not allowed to ladies by the fashion of this age and country; as skating on the ice in winter, swimming in summer, funambula∣tion, or dancing on the streight rope: but walking with a stately measured step occa∣sionally, like the march of soldiers, and reading aloud frequently rather in a thea∣tric manner, as well as dancing and singing,
<PB N="100" REF="033601_0101_0FF77F5B79642F38"/>will much contribute to give strength and grace to the muscles of locomotion, and of vocality.</P>

<PB REF="033601_0102_0FF77F5DAE4BFD60"/>
<HEAD>SECTION XXVI. AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE strength and activity of young people not only depends on the perpetual exercise of their limbs, as described in the preceding sections, but on the purity of the air, which they breathe, and even on the occasional coldness of it. The cold air of winter acts on delicate people like a cold bath; as it diminishes the action of the sub∣cutaneous vessels for a time, and thus pro∣duces an accumulation of animal power, whence an increased action of those vessels and a consequent warmth of the surface of the body succeeds; and by this less expen∣diture of animal power during immersion in cold air, and its consequent accumula∣tion, the person becomes stronger for a time and more animated; which is termed
<PB N="102" REF="033601_0103_0FF77F600644C450"/>in common language, "bracing the sys∣tem." Hence to strengthen delicate chil∣dren they should be encouraged to go into the cold air of winter frequently, but should not remain in it longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time. In summer young people can scarcely continue too much in the air, where they are shaded from the heat of the sun.</P>
<P>A constant immersion in pure air is now known to contribute much both to the health of the system, and to the beau∣tiful colour of the complexion. And this atmosphere should undergo a perpetual change and renovation; that the vital air, which constitutes about one-fourth part of it, may not be too much diminished by frequent respiration. Due attention should be given to this important circumstance both by frequently urging the young la∣dies to amuse themselves out of doors; and by the proper ventilation of the school-room, dining-room, bed-rooms, and
<PB N="103" REF="033601_0104_0FF7A21B6ECBD008"/>their other apartments. For this purpose it is convenient to saw off about one inch from the top of every door of these crowd∣ed rooms, and opposite to this aperture to nail along the top of the door a tin plate about two inches wide, rising at an angle of about forty-five degrees; which will bend the current of air up towards the ceil∣ing; where it will be mixed with the warm air of the room, and sink down a∣mongst the society without the danger of giving cold to any one: And, besides these door-ventilators, the upper sashes of every window should always be let down a few inches, when the external weather will admit of it.</P>
<P>In respect to bed rooms, which have more than one bed, the doors should be furnished with similar ventilators for the due admission of fresh air; and during the summer-months a window should be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the day; the sash of which should have
<PB N="104" REF="033601_0105_0FF7A21E0B5C0CF0"/>a bolt or other proper fastening for this purpose; nor should the fire-place be stopt up at any season by a chimney-board, or a bag of straw; as many rooms are made to shut up so close, that this is the only aperture, by which fresh air is admitted. To this should be added, that the bed-curtains should never be drawn close round the beds; which confine the air spoiled by frequent respiration, and the perspirable matter, like a noxious at∣mosphere over the unconscious sleepers. At the same time none of the beds should be placed very near either to an open win∣dow, or to an open chimney, as a partial current of air might be injurious by the coldness it might occasion.</P>
<P>In crowded bed-rooms, where children are close shut up for eight or nine hours every night, not only the pale bloated complexion, which is seen in children of crowded manufactories; but other diseases are produced by the impurity of the air,
<PB N="105" REF="033601_0106_0FF7A21F985D9450"/>such as indigestion, difficulty of breath∣ing, and sometimes convulsive fits, as mentioned in Zoonomia, vol. II. class. iii. 1.1.5. and lastly putrid fevers; of which fatal instances frequently occur in the crowded habitations of the poor. Hence parents cannot be too careful in inspecting the bed-rooms, and the beds of the schools, to which they entrust their children; as not only their present comfort, but their future health, and sometimes their lives depend on this attention; as is further explained in the section on rheumatism.</P>
<P>Besides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual supply of pure air in sum∣mer, something should be here said about the manner of warming them in winter. As the quantity of air carried up a chim∣ney is very great, owing to its being ren∣dered so much lighter than the external atmosphere by the heat of the fire, strong currents of cold air press into the room at every chink of the doors and windows
<PB N="106" REF="033601_0107_0FF7A22152320520"/>passing towards the fire; and are liable to give catarrh, rheumatism, kibed heels, and swelled fingers, to those scholars, who are exposed to them. To lessen these cur∣rents of cold air setting in at every aper∣ture, the chimney should be so contracted over the fire-grate, as to admit no more of the warm air to go up it, than is necessary to carry up the smoke; and hence much more of the warm air near the fire-place will rise up to the cieling; and descend∣ing, as it becomes cooler, in the distant parts of the room, will form a kind of ver∣tical eddy, and warm the whole apart∣ment; adding greatly to the heat produ∣ced by the radiation from the fire.</P>
<P>To effect this Doctor Franklin recom∣mended an iron or tin plate to slide under the mantle-piece over the fire, so as to con∣tract the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width, all the length over the fire-grate. And lately Count Rumford has accomplished the same purpose by a
<PB N="107" REF="033601_0108_0FF7A225F96004D0"/>flat stone about twelve inches broad, and eighteen inches high; which is reared up∣on one end at the back of the fire-place, a∣bout eight inches above the grate, and leans forward towards the mantle-piece, so as to leave an aperture, three or four inches wide, and twelve or fourteen inches long, over the front of the fire-place. The use of both these contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney, and thus to ad∣mit no more warm air up it, than is neces∣sary to convey the smoke. And the slid∣ing iron plate in Franklin's plan, and the end-reared stone in Rumford's plan, are designed to be occasionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimney-sweeper. These are described in detail in the essays of Doctor Franklin, and Count Rumford; and it is believed, that one-third of the fuel may be thus saved, and the rooms be kept more equally warm, and more salu∣tary.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. CARE OF THE SHAPE.</HEAD>
<P>DELICATE young ladies are very liable to become awry at many board∣ing schools, this is occasioned principal∣ly by their being obliged too long to pre∣serve an erect attitude, by sitting on forms for many hours together. To prevent this, the school-seats should ei∣ther have backs, on which they may oc∣casionally rest themselves; or desks be∣fore them, on which they may occasion∣ally lean. This is a thing of greater con∣sequence, than may appear to those, who have not attended to it; and who wish their children to acquire a very erect attitude.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="033601_0110_0FF7A22929F852E0"/>
When the least tendency to become awry is observed, they should be advis∣ed to lie down on a bed or sofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents the increase of this deformity by taking off for a time the pressure of the head and neck and shoulders on the spine of the back; and it at the same time tends to make them grow taller.</P>
<P>Young persons, when nicely measur∣ed, are found to be half an inch higher in the morning than at night; as is well known to those, who inlist very young men for soldiers. This is owing to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compressed by the weight of the head and shoulders on them during the day. It is the same pressure, which produces curvitures and distortions of the spine in growing children, where the bones are softer than usual; and which may thus be relieved by an hori∣zontal
<PB N="110" REF="033601_0111_0FF7A22BC7D09C40"/>posture for an hour in the middle of the day, or by being frequently allow∣ed to lean on a chair, or to play on a carpet on the ground.</P>
<P>Young ladies should also be directed, where two sleep in a bed, to change every night, or every week, their sides of the bed; which will prevent their tendency to sleep always on the same side; which is not only liable to produce crook∣edness, but also to occasion diseases by the internal parts being so long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the same reason they should not be allowed to sit always on the same side of the fire or window: because they will then be inclined too frequently to bend towards one side; which in those consti∣tutions, where the bones are too soft, is liable to produce crookedness of the spine.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="033601_0112_0FF7A22D563E88C8"/>
Another great cause of injury to the shape of young ladies is from the pres∣sure of stays, or other tight bandages; which at the same time cause other dis∣eases by changing the form or situation of the internal parts. If a hard part of the stays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are sewed together, is press∣ed upon one side more than the other; the child bends from the side, which is uneasy, and thus occasions a curviture of the spine. To counteract this effect such stays, as have fewest hard parts, and especially such as can be daily or week∣ly turned, are preferable to others. A wise fashion of wearing no stiff stays, which adds so much to the beauty of young ladies, has commenced since the above was written; and long may it continue!</P>
<P>Where frequently lying down on a sofa in the day time, and swinging fre∣quently
<PB N="112" REF="033601_0113_0FF7A230CEE9F670"/>for a small time by the head, with loose dress, do not relieve a beginning dis∣tortion of the back, I have used with some success a swing for children to sleep in, as described in Zoonomia, vol. II. class. I 2.2.16. and also a crutch-chair, as there delineated; and where these do not seem to succeed, recourse may also be had to Mons. Vacher's spinal machine, first described in the memoirs of the academy of Surgery in Paris, vol. III. with a good print of it; and since made by Mr. Jones in London, at No. 6, North-street, Tottenham-court Road; which suspends the head, and places the weight of it on the hips.</P>
<P>It will be from hence easily perceived that all other methods of confining or di∣recting the growth of young people should be used with great skill, such as back∣boards, or bandages; and that their appli∣cation should not be continued too long at a time; least worse consequences should ensue, than the deformity they are design∣ed
<PB N="113" REF="033601_0114_0FF7A2325D6F6A68"/>to remove. Of these the stocks for the feet of children, for the purpose of making them turn their toes quite out, and the frame for pressing in their knees, as they stand erect, at the same time, I suspect, when carried to excess, to be particularly injurious, and to have caused an irrecover∣able lameness of hip-joint; as explained in Zoonomia, vol. II. class I. 2.2.17. These therefore should be used with pro∣per caution, so as to give no pain or un∣easy feels, or not used at all.</P>
<P>To this it may be proper to add, that the stiff erect attitude, taught by some mo∣dern dancing masters, does not contribute to the grace of person, but rather militates against it; as is well seen in one of the prints in Hogarth's analysis of beauty; and is exemplified by the easy grace of some of the ancient statues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous; and in the works of some modern artists, as in a beau∣tiful print of Hebe feeding an eagle,
<PB N="114" REF="033601_0115_0FF7A234E963D728"/>painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton; and many of the figures of An∣gelica Kauffman. And lastly, which is so eminently seen in many of the beauties of the present day, since they have left off the constraint of whale-bone stays, and as∣sumed the graceful dress of the ancient Grecian statues.</P>
<P>In the tendency to curviture of the spine whatever strengthens the general constitution is of service, as the use of the cold bath in the summer months. This however requires some restriction both in respect to the degree of coldness of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the season of the year. Common springs, which are of 48 degrees of heat, are too cold for tender constitutions, whether of children or adults; and frequently do them great and irreparable injury, as I have witnessed in three or four cases. The coldness of river water in the summer
<PB N="115" REF="033601_0116_0FF7A237823FA730"/>months, which is about 65 degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about 68, or of Bux∣ton, which is 82, are much to be prefer∣red: The two latter are improperly called warm baths, comparing their degree of heat with that of common springs; where∣as they are in reality cold baths, being of much lower degree of heat than that of the human body, which is 98. The time of continuing in a cold bath should be but a few minutes; certainly not so long as to occasion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In respect to the season of the year, delicate children should certainly only use cold bathings in the summer months; as the going frequently into the cold air in winter will answer all the purposes of the cold bath.</P>
<P>Other means of counteracting the de∣bility of the system, or softness of bones, which occasion crookedness, consist in tak∣ing internally from 10 to 20 grains of ex∣tract of bark, with as much soda phospho∣rata,
<PB N="116" REF="033601_0117_0FF7A239F57D11C8"/>and mixed with from five to ten drops of tincture of opium, twice a day for three or four weeks; as is further treated of in Zoonomia, vol. II. class I. 2.2.14. and 16.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVIII. DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Ladies should be instruct∣ed to shew attention to their dress, as it gives an idea of cleanliness of their per∣sons; which has so great a charm, that it may be reckoned amongst the inferior vir∣tues; for this purpose an elegant simplici∣ty of dress is to be recommended in pre∣ference to that superabundance of orna∣ment, where the lady herself is the least part of her. The form of dress must ne∣vertheless perpetually vary with the fashion of the time; but a person of taste may lessen those parts of a fashionable dress, which oppose beauty or grace; and bring forwards those, which are more coincident with them; so as to wear a dress in fashion, and yet not devoid of taste.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="033601_0119_0FF7A23E3604E350"/>
Thus when large hoops were in gene∣ral use, which so totally militate with all ideas of beauty and grace; ladies of taste wore them as small, as custom would al∣low. So in respect to the ear-rings of the present day; since piercing the tender part of the ear for the purpose of suspend∣ing a weight of gold, or of precious stones, or of glass beads to it, reminds us of the savage state of mankind; those ladies of taste, who think themselves obliged to com∣ply with this indecorous fashion, use the lightest materials, as a chain of small pearls, to give a less distressing idea of the pain, they seem to suffer at every motion of their heads. Hence also long pendant and complicated ear-rings, however they may add to the dignity of riper years by their costliness, are unbecoming to young ladies; as they seem to give pain in the quicker, tho' more graceful, motions of juvenility.</P>
<P>Sir Joshua Reynolds, I think, observes in one of his addresses to the academy,
<PB N="119" REF="033601_0120_0FF7A241E0D3F610"/>that hard curls of hair stiffened with the fat of hogs, and covered with the flower of wheat, cannot be admitted into picture. The same may be observed of that coat of mail, the whale-bone stays, the use of which is now so happily discontinued. Both of these, however they may conceal the grey hairs and waining figures of those, who are advanced in life, are highly inju∣rious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies.</P>
<P>As beauty consists of lines flowing in easy curves according to the analysis of Hogarth; those parts of dress, which are composed of such lines, are always agreea∣ble. Thus a sash descending from one shoulder to the opposite hip, or a grecian veil thrown back and winding carelessly down behind, are always beautiful; but a few white ostrich feathers rising on the head before, and a train of silk sweeping on the ground behind, add so much grace to a moving female figure, as to attract all eyes with unceasing admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="033601_0121_0FF7A24374114CC8"/>
In moving forwards the hair falls back, and in very swift motion floats upon the air behind; hence by association of ideas, when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks, it gives an intimation of the youth∣ful agility of the person; and when it is brought forwards over the cheeks, it may consent with unmoving dignity, like the full wig of a judge, but diminishes our idea of the activity of playful youth.</P>
<P>Where the appearance of use in dress can be given to ornaments, it suggests an excuse for wearing them, and is therefore to be preferred; as diamond pins, strings of pearl, and a comb of shell, to restrain the exuberant hair; or knots of ribbons to fix the slipper on the foot, to contract the sleeve around the arm, to unite the vest up∣on the bosom, or to attach the cap above the forehead. And when these are similar in colour, it gives an air of simplicity, and a kind of pyramidal form to the dress; which the painters so much endeavour to
<PB N="121" REF="033601_0122_0FF7A245064DA5C0"/>exhibit both in their landscapes, and their groups of figures.</P>
<P>Other ornaments, which bear no analo∣gy to use in dress, should be sparingly worn; lest they give an idea, that they were designed to display the pride of the possessor, rather than to decorate her per∣son. These are sometimes seen so ill placed as to make deformities conspicuous, as a number of rings on singers distorted with the gout, or splendid buckles on turn∣ed-in feet. Where there is no appear∣ance of use, all shining ornaments should be so disposed as to direct the eye of the be∣holder to some beautiful feature of the la∣dy, who wears them; as diamond stars in the hair, and artificial flowers on the bosom.</P>
<P>Paint and perfumes are totally inadmis∣sible in the dress of young ladies, as they give a suspicion of natural defects in res∣pect to colour of the skin, and odour
<PB N="122" REF="033601_0123_0FF7A2469D53B890"/>of the breath. Where there exists but a mediocrity of beauty, and youth is in the wain, a variety of pretty or of costly ornaments on the dress, and even the whiteness of powder in the hair, may sometimes mingle with our idea of the per∣son, and seem to render the whole fairer, more pleasing, or more respectable. But ornaments of every kind are useless or in∣jurious to youthful beauty; they add no power to the charm, but rather disenchant the beholder by abstracting his attention; which dwells with undiminished rapture on beauty arrayed by simplicity, and ani∣mated without affectation. Thus the ma∣jestic juno of Homer is arrayed in variety of ornament, and with ear-rings, which have three large pendant bobs to each, and commands universal homage. But his Queen of Beauty is dressed with more sim∣ple elegance, in her magic sash, or cestus, and charms all eyes.</P>
<P>The attention to taste in dress may ne∣vertheless be carried into an extreme; it
<PB N="123" REF="033601_0124_0FF7A24B2C5C79D0"/>should not seem to be the most important part of the education of a young lady; or the principal object of her care; she should rather appear to follow than to lead the fa∣shion, according to the lines of Mr. Pope.</P>
<P>Be not the first, on which the new are tried, Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.</P>

<P>ARE generally distinguished from exercise, as they relieve or exhilerate the mind. Cards may be occasionally used by children in private families, without their gaming for money; and will in general fa∣cilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; but cannot be allowed in schools, lest the young ladies should expend too much time upon them, or should play for money clan∣destinely. But the game of chess, from its bearing so great analogy to common life, is supposed much to improve the most useful powers of the mind: It has the experience of the remotest antiquity to recommend it, occasions no depraved passions, as it is not played for money; and by the caution per∣petually necessary to watch your adversary,
<PB N="125" REF="033601_0126_0FF7A24E50B5F440"/>and the judgment required to contrive, ar∣range, and manage your own affairs, em∣ploys and strengthens every part of the understanding.</P>
<P>Embroidery, drawing, music, as well as the exercises of dancing, swinging, play∣ing at ball, and shuttlecock, should be classed amongst the amusements of young ladies; and should be reciprocally ap∣plied to, either in the house or in the open air, for the purpose of relieving each other; and of producing by such means an uninterrupted cheerfulness of mind; which is the principal charm, that fits us for so∣ciety, and the great source of earthly hap∣piness.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXX. PUNISHMENTS. REWARDS. MOTIVES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the custom of many schools to use some kinds of punishments, which either give pain or disgrace to the delin∣quent, as a fool's cap, or a meal of water gruel. The use of these are seldom if ever necessary in schools for young ladies, and are always attended with disagreeable consequences, as they either diminish the character of honour in the punished per∣sons, sink their spirits, or render them in∣sensible to the opinions of others; or in∣jure their health: Insomuch that at some schools all that can be acquired can scarce∣ly compensate the loss of cheerfulness, and degradation of mind, or bad health, which their punishments produce.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="033601_0128_0FF7A253C5AE1618"/>
Thus the sitting in the public school for an hour in a cap with bells diminishes the sensibility of a child to the opinions of her companions, and thus gradually de∣stroys one of the greatest motives to good actions, and of the greatest restraints from bad ones. For the same reason repri∣mands and even admonitions should be al∣ways applied in private, but applause or re∣ward in public.</P>
<P>A meal of water gruel, given as a pu∣nishment instead of a meal of animal food, so frequently had recourse to in some boarding schools, I believe to have laid the foundation of incurable debility. The diseases of debility, as scrophula, bronch∣ocele, softness of bones, and the conse∣quent distortion of them, are very com∣mon among the children of the poor in Derby, which on examination, I believe to be owing to their food consisting chiefly of gruel; or sometimes with milk, which has been twice skimmed, so that it is total∣ly
<PB N="128" REF="033601_0129_0FF7A2565E86F4E8"/>deprived of its most nourishing part; at other times with weak salt broth, but sel∣dom with solid animal food. When broth is weak in respect to the quantity of flesh∣meat boiled in it, it is the custom of cooks to add much salt to it to increase the relish, which renders it still more injurious to weak children; as salt contains no nou∣rishment, and by its stimulus increases the action of the system; and by promoting great insensible or sensible perspiration di∣minishes the strength of the child more, than the small quantity of meat dissolved in the broth can counterbalance.</P>
<P N="2">2. How then are refractory children to be governed? certainly by the superi∣ority of the mind of the teacher over that of the pupil. When a famous lady in Italy was put to the torture, and question∣ed by what sorcery she had governed a princess of the family of Medici; she an∣swered "by no sorcery, but by that power, which superior minds possess over inferi∣or ones."</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="129" REF="033601_0130_0FF7A258401A0FE0"/>
3. Besides the two circumstances, which so much govern the great world, I mean hope of reward and fear of punish∣ment; in the microscosm of a boarding school blame and praise, if given very sparingly, will be found strong motives to the little pupils to perform their tasks well, and of more efficacy ten times, than the meal of water gruel, or the disgrace of a cap and bells. Esteem and disgrace are observed by Mr. Locke to be of all others the most powerful incentives to the mind, when once it is brought to regard them: And if once you can communicate to chil∣dren a love of credit, and an apprehension of shame, you have instilled into them a principle, which will constantly act, and incline them to do right, tho' it is not the true source from whence our actions ought to spring; which should be from our duty to others and to ourseives.—See Essay on education, sect. 56, &amp;c. where are many other valuable observations on this subject.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="130" REF="033601_0131_0FF7A25AEFA4D6A0"/>
4. Emulation at seeing others excel, if properly managed is another incitement to industry. But as this is liable to de∣generate into envy, it should rather be left to its own operation, than be promoted by pointing out the examples, which should be copied. It is better to say, "your task is not done to day so well as you sometimes do it," than to say, "your task is not done so well as your sister's." Since in the lat∣ter case envy, and its consequence hatred, may succeed; a thing of tenfold worse consequence than the neglect of a thousand tasks.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tho' some degree of flattery may be used with success in teaching veracity to very young children, as mentioned in sect. 18. of this work, yet I think it should be used very rarely indeed, and only on very important occasions, lest it should become a necessary motive of action, instead of moral duty; as observed in Zoonomia, vol. II. class iii. 2.1.8. "The debi∣lity
<PB N="131" REF="033601_0132_0FF7A25DB76BB6B0"/>of the exertion of voluntary efforts prevents the accomplishment of all the great purposes of life. This often origi∣nates from a mistaken education; in which pleasure or vanity is made the immediate motive of action, and not fu∣ture advantage, or what is termed duty. This observation is of great value to those, who attend to the early education of their own children."</P>
<P>"I have seen one or two young mar∣ried ladies of fortune, who perpetually became uneasy, and believed themselves ill, a week after their arrival in the coun∣try; and continued so uniformly during their stay; yet on their return to Lon∣don or to Bath immediately lost all their complaints; and this I observed to hap∣pen to them repeatedly. All which I was led to ascribe to their being in their infancy surrounded with menial attend∣ants, who had slattered them into the exertions, which they then used. And
<PB N="132" REF="033601_0133_0FF7A2606E9BCB10"/>that in their mature years they became torpid for the want of this stimulus, and could not amuse themselves by any vol∣untary employment, but required ever after to be slattered into activity; or to be amused by others."</P>
<P N="6">6. Rewards have been given to children to excite their industry in the performance of particular tasks; these are certainly less eligible motives to action than the fear of disgrace, the love of re∣putation, and above all the obligations of duty. Where nevertheless these are thought proper, the kind of rewards re∣quires some attention; which should consist of books, or maps, or boxes of colours, or needle cases: but not of mo∣ney, or of trinkets for ornamental dress, or of a glass of wine. Where money is given as a reward for industry in chil∣dren, it may seem to them to be the pro∣per motive of their actions instead of re∣putation or of duty; and may thus in∣duce
<PB N="133" REF="033601_0134_0FF7A2620156E928"/>the vice of avarice or of extrava∣gance. Where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of diligence, the pride of dress may be produced, and become their great motive of action, instead of the love of reputation, or of duty. And lastly, where a glass of wine is given as a reward for industry, a child is taught to believe wine to be a most valuable ac∣quisition, and a perpetual desire of it even to intoxication may be the con∣sequence. I remember a wealthy farm∣er, who had two drunken sons, tho' he was a sober man himself, who told me, that he ascribed this great misfortune to his having occasionally given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for their exertious.—See Locke on edu∣cation, sect. 52, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. A very accurate observer, who has long had the conduct of schools of various kinds for the instruction of the youth of both sexes, acquaints me, "That
<PB N="134" REF="033601_0135_0FF7A263A72243C8"/>he has often with extreme surprize ob∣served a child make a greater progress in some one branch of education in three months, than another of similar age, oppor∣tunity, capacity, and even apparently of equal application, has been able to effect in three years." The same observation has been made by others, but he adds, "That this might probably arise from some trivial circumstance, which deter∣mined the inclination of the fortunate stu∣dent; and that it is possible, that the means may sometime be discovered of governing these incidents, and thus producing a new era in the art of education!"</P>
<P>Similar to this it has often been observ∣ed, that the first impressions made on our infant minds by accidental disgust, admi∣ration, or flattery, are the frequent causes of our antipathies or aversions, and con∣tinue through life to bias our affections or mislead our judgments. One of my ac∣quaintance can trace the origin of many of his own energies of action from some
<PB N="135" REF="033601_0136_0FF7A2674D0C2A08"/>such remote sources; which justifies the observation of M. Rousseau, that the seeds of future virtues or vices are oftener sown by the mother than by the tutor.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXI. LISPING.</HEAD>
<P>LISPING is a defect of pronuncia∣tion occasioned by children's making use of the sound of the letter TH sibilant in∣stead of the letter S; as instead of "is it so," they say "ith it tho." To break this habit they must be taught to pronounce the S, by putting the point of the tongue against the roots of the upper teeth; and not to put it between their teeth as in pro∣nouncing the TH. This is easily accom∣plished by putting their own finger against the point of the tongue, as it comes be∣tween their teeth, in attempting to pro∣nounce the letter S, and pushing it back into the mouth.</P>
<P>I once saw a young lady, who after she had left school, had the habit of using oc∣casionally,
<PB N="137" REF="033601_0138_0FF7A26B67227A78"/>tho' not constantly, the gutteral CH instead of the letter S, which was un∣commonly disagreeable to English ears. She corrected this ill habit by being taught, as above, how to place the tongue in pro∣nouncing the S, but not without many trials and much attention for some weeks; as great efforts and pertinacious industry are required to break any habit, which has been long esiablished.</P>
<P>Many children from the difficulty of speaking it are liable to a defective pronun∣ciation of the letter R; this in indeed al∣most general in some parts of Northumber∣land, and is said to be a sound unknown in China; which obliged the catholic mis∣sionaries sent thither by Louis the 14th to change the name of the virgin Mary, from Maria into Malia, or from Mary into Mal∣ly. In speaking the letter R the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with semivo∣cal air; whereas in pronouncing L, the edges of the tongue only vibrate; the
<PB N="138" REF="033601_0139_0FF7A26DDF1C3008"/>Northumberland vernacular R is formed with sibilant air instead of semivocal air, or differs from the true R, as S differs from Z. Both which should be explained to those children, who have this imperfect pronunciation.</P>
<P>Among the lower orders of the people of London, who are called Cockneys, the letter W is pronounced sibilant like the German W, and not semivocal like our vernacular one; this seems to resemble the sound of V to inattentive ears; and these Cockneys, are thence supposed to use V instead of W, as Vomen and Vine, instead of Women and Wine. This defect is rea∣dily conquered by teaching such children to give more vocal sound to their W, by sounding it at first like OO.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXII. STAMMERING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS impediment of speech has ge∣nerally for its remote cause a too great dif∣fidence, or bashfulness, joined with an am∣bition of shining in conversation; and for its immediate cause an interruption of the asso∣ciation of the initial letter of a word with the remainder of it. Which association is dis∣severed by the ill-introduced sensation of awe, bashfulness, desire of shining, or fear of not succeeding; and then violent vo∣luntary efforts are in vain employed to re∣join the broken association, and give rise to various distortions of countenance, as explained in Zoonomia, vol. II. class iv. 2.3.1.</P>
<P>That this impediment of pronuncia∣tion is altogether a disease of the mind, and
<PB N="140" REF="033601_0141_0FF7A273280890D0"/>not of the organs of speech, is shewn by the stammerer being able to speak all words with perfect facility, when alone, as in re∣peating a play; but begins to hesitate, if any one approaches; or even if he ima∣gines, that he is listened to. Those words also are most difficult to him to pronounce, which he is conscious, he cannot change for others, as when he is asked his own name, or the names of other persons, or of places; and the more so if he is aware, that the hearer is impatient to be inform∣ed, and that he cannot conjecture the name, before it is spoken.</P>
<P>It requires great attention, and much time to overcome this bad habit; they should be daily exercised in speaking sin∣gle words as in spelling; and when they hesitate or find difficulty in announcing the beginning of a word, they should re∣peat it frequently aloud without the initial letter, and at length repeat it with the ini∣tial letter in a soster tone.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="033601_0142_0FF7A274B5912668"/>
Suppose the stammerer finds difficulty in speaking the word "Paper," and says p, p, p, p, repeatedly, but cannot join the a after it. He must be taught to pronounce aper, aper, aper, without the initial p, for many successive times; and this aper should be spoken aloud with more breath than common, as if an h preceded it; and at length he should add in a softer tone the letter p to it.</P>
<P>This, together with an hourly atten∣tion to speaking and reading slowly, and practising in this manner every word, which is not readily spoken, both in pri∣vate and in company, I am informed is the principle, on which those masters cure this impediment, who make it a profession; and to this should be added a frequent in∣troduction to the society of strangers, in order to acquire less agitation or anxiety about the opinions of others.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIII. SQUINTING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS defect of vision, which is term∣ed strabismns, may frequently be con∣quered in children, if it be attended to early, before it has been long established by habit. In this deformity it generally happens, that one eye is better than the other, which induces the child to view ob∣jects with the best eye, and to hide the center of the nose. This greater irritabi∣lity of one eye is often occasioned, I sus∣pect, in infancy, by tying a bandage for too long a time over an eye, which has happened to be slightly inflamed, and thus decreasing its power of action by di∣suse; in the same manner the large muscles of the body become weakened by long in∣action; and the right arm is generally
<PB N="143" REF="033601_0144_0FF7A27AF0126580"/>stronger than the left from its having been more frequently exercised.</P>
<P>In this case if the best eye be for an hour or two, or longer, covered every day with gauze stretched upon a circular piece of whale-bone, so as to render the vision of this eye as indistinct as that of the other, the child will naturally turn them both to the same object, and in a little time the weak eye will become stronger by being used, or the strong one weaker by disuse, and the child will cease to squint.</P>
<P>Another kind of squinting is owing in∣tirely to a bad habit, and consists in look∣ing at objects with one eye only at a time. The owl bends both his eyes upon the ob∣ject, which he observes; and by thus perpe∣tually turning his head to the thing he in∣spects, appears to have greater attention to it; and has thence acquired the name of the bird of wisdom. All other birds, I believe, look at objects with one eye only, but it is
<PB N="144" REF="033601_0145_0FF7A27C8207C680"/>with the eye nearest the object attended to; whereas in this kind of strabismns the per∣son attends to objects with the most distant eye only. This habit has probably been produced, by a cap worn in infancy, which projected forward beyond the head on each side, like the bluffs of a coach-horse, so as to make it easier for the child, as he lay in his cradle, to view oblique objects with the eye most distant from them; which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>A curious case of this ill habit of vision is related in the Philos. Transact. vol. 68. by Dr. Darwin; which was relieved by fix∣ing a parchment gnomon on the nose of the little boy, which projected about an inch from the ridge of it, and caused him for a time to view oblique objects with that eye, which was nearest them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIV. INVOLUNTARY MOTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>BY confinement in a school-room for many successive hours, and that with∣out being suffered to vary their posture, some of the more active and lively chil∣dren are liable to gain tricks of involun∣tary actions, as twitchings of the face, restless gesticulations of the limbs, biting their nails, &amp;c. which are generally at first occasioned by the want of sufficient bodily exercise to expend the superfluous animal power, like the jumping of a squirrel in a cage; but are also liable to be caught by imitation of each other.</P>
<P>To prevent this kind of deformity children should be suffered to change their attitudes and situations more fre∣quently;
<PB N="146" REF="033601_0147_0FF7A280ADC79AC0"/>or to walk about, as they get their lessons. To counteract it the ear∣liest attention is necessary; as a few weeks frequently establish a bad habit, which cannot be removed without great diffi∣culty: This however may be effected early in the disease by a bandage nicely applied on the moving muscles, or by adhesive plasters put tightly over them; or by an issue placed over them, so as to give a little pain, when the muscles are thrown into action under it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXV. SWELLED FINGERS,</HEAD>
<P>AND kibed heels, are inflammations liable to affect tender children in many schools during the winter months. The latter of these complaints is generally ow∣ing to the coldness of a brick or plaster floor to their feet, or to their sitting in un∣changed shoes and stockings, after walk∣ing in the wet; and the former to their being kept too long from the fire in the cold parts of the school-room without gloves.</P>
<P>Nothing prevents or cures these mala∣dies but a due attention to keep the ex∣tremities of delicate children warm, either by clothing, exercise, or fire. The in∣flammation of the heels or toes may be
<PB N="148" REF="033601_0149_0FF7A28608513A08"/>sometimes removed by covering them with a double linen rag moistened in a satur∣nine solution made by dissolving half an ounce of sugar of lead in half a pint of water, to be renewed morning and night. As the swelling of the fingers thus pro∣duced is liable to continue, and to injure the shape of them, it becomes of greater importance; but may in some measure be afterwards diminished or removed by the frequent application of vitriolic Ether to them.</P>
<P>The skin of the lips, and of the hands and arms of children is liable to become inflamed, and chopped, or rough, in frosty weather, owing both to the coldness and dryness of the air. The former is re∣lieved by the application of a lip-salve made by mixing minium or red lead with spermaceti and oil to a proper consistance; or by blue mercurial ointment. The lat∣ter by wearing leathern gloves, the inside of which is smeared with spermaceti soft∣ened
<PB N="149" REF="033601_0150_0FF7A287985A9E80"/>with a little oil, or with pomatum; gloves thus prepared prevent too great ex∣halation from the skin in frosty air, and the consequent too great dryness and rough∣ness of it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXVI. BEDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE rheumatism, and other inflam∣matory diseases, are frequently occa∣sioned in crowded schools by placing some of the beds with one side against a wall; where the weaker child confined by a stronger bedfellow is liable to lie for hours together with some part of it in contact with the cold wall; which in the winter months has often been at∣tended with fatal consequences; and especially in those boarding schools, where the beds are small, and but one blanket allowed to each of them, and a scanty feather-bed.</P>
<P>We are indued with a very accurate sense to distinguish heat and cold, which
<PB N="151" REF="033601_0152_0FF7A28DD82E4AD8"/>should be nicely attended to; as the ex∣tremes of both of them are injurious to health, and more so in our sleeping than in our waking hours. The extreme of heat is not much experienced in this climate, except when it is artificially produced; but that of cold is the cause of numerous diseases of the most fatal tendency. A severe continued frost may may be borne by the strong, who can keep themselves warm by their activity, but is destructive to the weak and seden∣tary. In the year 1795 the weather in January, and in one week of February was uncommonly severe; the same five weeks in January and February 1796 were uncommonly mild; and it appears by the bills of mortality in London, that 2823 people died in these five weeks of frost in 1795; and that only 1471 died in the same five weeks of mild weather in 1796, which is not much more than half the number.—See a paper by Dr. Heberden in Philos. Transact. for the year 1796.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="033601_0153_0FF7A28F65E821D0"/>
Some misinformed parents have con∣ceived, that a hard bed contributes to harden their children in respect to their bearing cold, and have on that account laid them on straw-mattresses, or on beds with boarded bottoms. The only dif∣ference between lying on a soft or hard bed consists in this; the weight of the body in the former case presses on a larger surface, and in the latter on a less; neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderness or hardiness in respect to cold and heat; unless indeed a feather-bed is so soft, that, as the child sinks down in the middle of it, the rising edges bend over him, and in part cover him. Perhaps beds made of soft leather properly prepared, and inflated with air, as the Emperor of Germany was said to use in camp, might be preferable on this account to feather-beds.</P>
<P>The beds for young children cannot therefore be too soft, however they may
<PB N="153" REF="033601_0154_0FF7A290F5DABA58"/>contribute to the indolence of grown people provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them as a∣bove described. But the too great hard∣ness of beds is, I believe, frequently inju∣rious to the shape of infants by occasion∣ing them to rest on too few parts at a time; which hardens those parts by pres∣sure, and prevents their proportionate growth. It also occasions their sleep to be less sound by the uneasiness it causes, and in consequence less refreshing.</P>
<P>The feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to become cold in bed in winter, on which account it is more salutary for them to sleep with a bed-fellow, rather than alone; as they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their companion in bed, and thus frequently prevent rheu∣matic, and other inflammatory diseases of fatal event. For the same reason it is better for a new born infant to sleep
<PB N="154" REF="033601_0155_0FF7A292969C0660"/>with its mother in winter, or with a young nurse, than in a solitary crib by her bed-side; unless the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated, than is commonly done.</P>
<P>For the same reason, where children are too feeble from illness, a fire should be allowed in their bed-chamber in cold weather; as the cold air is otherwise injurious to their lungs, which cannot be clothed so as to prevent the contact of of the air, like the other parts of the bo∣dy; a fire contributes also to ventilate a room, and to circulate the air in it, and thence to render it more salutary; but it should not warm it to more than 60 or 65 degrees, that its temperature may not differ too much from that of the external atmosphere; as those, who are kept generally too warm, are liable to take cold, at every blast of air, not from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> degree of cold, to which they hap∣pen
<PB N="155" REF="033601_0156_0FF7A297453D04C8"/>to be exposed, but to its difference from that, which they have been ac∣customed to.—See sect. xxvi.</P>
<P>The universal analogy derived from other animals, which produce a feeble offspring, evinces the truth of this doc∣trine, both in respect to the softness, and the due degree of warmth of their beds: Birds line the nests for their young with feathers; the eider duck, and the rabbit, pluck the down from their own breasts to increase the softness of the beds for their tender offspring; and brood them with their wings, or clasp them to their bosoms for the sake of warmth.</P>
<P>The number of hours required for salutary sleep is greater for younger chil∣dren, than for those more advanced; as during our progress through life we ac∣quire greater facility in using our volun∣tary power, and recruit it in less time when exhausted. The younger classes
<PB N="156" REF="033601_0157_0FF7A298D3C2E238"/>of scholars may go to rest at seven, or eight; but the elder should be allowed another hour for the purposes of reading or other kinds of improvement; the hour of rising must vary with the season.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXVII. DIET.</HEAD>
<P>MILK is the food designed by na∣ture for young animals, and should be gi∣ven them in its recent state. As the cream is the most nourishing part of the milk, and is easier of digestion than the coagulable or cheesy part; and as milk constitutes a principal portion of the ali∣ment of children; to take off the cream once, or even twice, as is practised in some boarding schools, before it is given to the children, is a shameful circumstance of parsimony, and very injurious to their healths.—See sect. xxx, on punishments.</P>
<P>Nor should the milk given to children be long kept in a boiling heat; because much of its fragrant oil is then evaporated,
<PB N="158" REF="033601_0159_0FF7A29CF4E1E720"/>as is evident from the fine odour of the steam of it, when taken from the fire; and its further deterioration from long boiling is shewn by its then inducing constipation, which is contrary to its effect in its recent and natural state.</P>
<P>Nevertheless even new milk does not always agree with children, after they have passed the years of infancy. For milk ta∣ken into the stomach must be always pre∣viously curdled or coagulated, before it can be digested, or converted into nou∣rishment: Hence milk is always found curdled in the stomachs of calves, and the acid juice of their stomachs is used to co∣agulate their milk in the process of cheese∣making: Now the stomachs of young chil∣dren abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years, and when a sufficient quantity of it is not produced for the pur∣pose of curdling the milk, which they drink, it is liable to disagree.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="033601_0160_0FF7A29E889FA828"/>
To these few therefore, whose sto∣machs do not easily digest the coagulable part of milk, other fluid sood should be al∣lowed to breakfast, as gruel, or tea with cream and sugar in it, and with bread and butter; and to supper, a slice of cold meat, or of cheese, or tart, or bread and butter, with small beer or water for drink; but it is probable, that milk might be made to agree with all stomachs, if it was previous∣ly curdled by rennet, as I have often re∣commended with success to elderly per∣sons; or by letting it stand, till it becomes spontaneously sour like buttermilk, as is the custom of the inferior people of Scot∣land; except nevertheless where the dis∣taste of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice, which is then incurable but by time.</P>
<P>For dinner animal food plain dressed, with vegetables or bread, and pudding of wheat flour, milk, and eggs, with sugar or butter, are more nourishing than vegetable
<PB N="160" REF="033601_0161_0FF7A2A2067394B0"/>sustenance alone. Wheat flour contains more nutriment than that of rice, or bar∣ley, or oats; as it possesses more starch in proportion to its bulk, and a gluten ap∣proaching to animal matter. But much salt or spice should not be allowed in the diet of children, as they are certainly un∣wholesome by inducing a weakness of the capillary and absorbent systems of vessels in consequence of their too great stimulus, and contain no nourishment.</P>
<P>As butter and sugar are perhaps the most nutritive of animal and vegetable substances, they may be more easily taken to excess; on which account some mistaken parents have totally prohibited the use of them; which is a great disadvantage to weaker children, who require more nutri∣tive diet in less bulk than stronger ones.</P>
<P>For the drink of the more robust chil∣dren water is preferable, and for the weak∣er ones, small beer; but in this, as well as
<PB N="161" REF="033601_0162_0FF7A2A39827EA08"/>in the choice of solid food, their palates should be consulted; for the nice discern∣ment of this sense is bestowed on us by na∣ture to distinguish, what the stomach can best digest. It should however be observ∣ed, that in artificial viands the taste cannot distinguish, what is unwholesome; as sugar may be mixed with arsenic. So in the drinking of fermented liquors, as ale or wine, which are chemical productions, the palate is not to be consulted; a glass of mere wine should never be given to chil∣dren, as it injures their tender stomachs like a glass of brandy or rum or gin to a grown person; and induces those diseases, which it is often erroneously given to pre∣vent; as weakness of digestion, with the production of worms in consequence. Wine nevertheless diluted with thrice its quantity of water may be allowed, if re∣quired, instead of small beer; or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="033601_0163_0FF7A2A53503DE70"/>
Ripe fruits, or fruit pies, are peculiar∣ly serviceable to the constitutions of chil∣dren, as well as agreeable to their palates; as they are known to prevent biliary con∣cretions, and consequent jaundice; and on the same account to render the skin clear∣er and fairer, as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid diseases. These should therefore be allowed to children at all sea∣sons; and may either occasionally consti∣tute a part of their diet; or may be recom∣mended to them, when they lay out part of their pocket-money with hucksters, in preference to seed-cakes, gingerbread, or sugar-plumbs; the former of which are generally made of bad flour deteriorated by spice; and the latter are liable to be co∣loured with gamboge, vermillion, verdi∣grease, or other noxious drugs.</P>
<P>Too long fasting, or food of less nou∣rishment than they have been accustomed to, are peculiarly injurious to children; as they weaken their power of digestion, im∣pair
<PB N="163" REF="033601_0164_0FF7A2AA08A958A0"/>their strength, and impede their growth. The children of the inferior poor, and of families, which have adopted some ill-advised rules of abstemious diet, are frequently starved into the scrophula, and become pale-faced and bloated, owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood, and to want of sufficient stimulus to the absorb∣ent system.</P>
<P>If young people are thought to be too corpulent, a diminution of food with an increase of exercise, when they have ob∣tained their full growth, may be used with advantage; but even then not without cau∣tion. Since young ladies, after they have left school, who by ill advice use too great abstinence, are liable to become pale and emaciated, and to fall into universal debi∣lity; which remains through a diseased and comfortless life.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXVIII. ECONOMY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A DUE regard to the prudent ex∣penditure of their money, a proper care of their clothes, and a parsimonious atten∣tion to the lapse of time, should be incul∣cated into the minds of young ladies. To effect these purposes one efficacious me∣thod, where the usual exhortations fail, may be to suffer their imprudence to pro∣duce some inconvenience to themselves; which they should be permitted to feel to a proper degree.</P>
<P>Thus a profuse unnecessary expendi∣ture of their pocket money will shortly in∣duce poverty; which should by no means be alleviated by a fresh supply of money; till the inconvenience produced has effect∣ed
<PB N="165" REF="033601_0166_0FF7A2AD531EED90"/>a conviction of the impropriety of their conduct. Except when the expenditure has been made for some laudable purpose, and then no time should be lost in restor∣ing the power of repeating it.</P>
<P>The same mean may be used in res∣pect to their omission to take care of their clothes; they should find the necessity of repairing them with their own hands, or of foregoing some visiting amusements, till new ones can be procured; that thus the consequent inconvenience may teach them economy, if they are otherwise too inat∣tentive to the usual admonitions on these subjects.</P>
<P>In respect to the economy of time the hours of amusement and of exercise should be regularly counted; and the length of time young ladies employ in dressing should be nicely attended to; as in adult life the hours consumed at the toilet of some ladies is perfectly ridiculous, and de∣tains
<PB N="166" REF="033601_0167_0FF7A2B019D55F70"/>them from more important duties. Perhaps a stated time might be allowed the young ladies for adjusting the articles of their dress, that they might acquire a habit of disposing them with neatness, taste, and elegance, and yet with expedition.</P>
<P N="2">2. Men are generally trained from their early years to the business or profes∣sion, in which they are afterwards to en∣gage; but it most frequently happens to ladies, that tho' destined to the superin∣tendance of a future family, they receive scarcely any previous instruction; but be∣gin this important office with a profound ignorance of the value of money, and of the proper application of the things, which surround them.</P>
<P>Many young ladies destitute of mo∣thers, and without a home, are continued at school to a later age; such should be formed into a class, and properly instruct∣ed in domestic economy; each of them
<PB N="167" REF="033601_0168_0FF7A2B2958A7338"/>superintending the business of the family, a week or a month by turns; not only pro∣viding for the table, and directing the cookery, but they should also be taught other parts of domestic employment, as cutting out linens, and making them up with plain and strong needle work, either for their own families, or to be given as clothing for necessitous infants or mothers.</P>
<P>Such an addition of domestic know∣ledge and benevolent industry to orna∣mental accomplishments would give the school, that procures it, a decided advan∣tage over other schools, which have no such institution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIX. SCHOOL-EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a school-educa∣tion, where twenty or thirty children are properly instructed, over that in a private family are derived from several sources. First, it must be observed, that almost all our exertions in early life are owing to our imitating others; in child∣hood we are most liable to imitate the actions of those, who are somewhat old∣er than ourselves; and in manhood, of those who are in somewhat higher life; whence the general prevalence of fa∣shion in dress and manners. Now there are more examples to cause imitative activity in well conducted schools, and the children in consequence become more active in the pursuit of their stu∣dies,
<PB N="169" REF="033601_0170_0FF7A2B69EB22B68"/>and in the acquirement of their ac∣complishments.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only chil∣dren, before they have acquired the use of reason or voluntary deliberation, but that the greatest part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi∣tating others; and that even dumb creatures seem capable of acquiring knowledge with greater facility by imi∣tating each other, than by any methods, by which we can teach them. Thus dogs, when they are sick, learn of each other to eat grass as an emetic; and cats to moisten their paws for the purpose of washing their faces. And the readiest way to instruct all brute animals is by practising them with others of the same species; which have already learnt the arts, we wish them to acquire, as ex∣plained in Zoonomia, vol. I. sect. 22.3.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="033601_0171_0FF7A2B84B298370"/>
A second advantage of schools, when well conducted, is that children often take pleasure in teaching each other, in∣somuch that at boy's schools I have of∣ten observed, that the lower classes have learnt more from their school-fellows of the higher classes, than even from their masters; which has sometimes arisen from the friendship, or vanity of the el∣der boy, and sometimes from the solicita∣tion of the lower one; but has in all cases been advantageous to both of them.</P>
<P>A third superiority of school educa∣tion arises from an emulation, which na∣turally exists, where many pursue the same studies, but which should not be encouraged by rewards or degradations; as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred; but should in general be left in∣tirely to its own operation; as mention∣ed in sect. xxx.</P>
<P>A fourth advantage of school-educa∣tion is from the children acquiring a
<PB N="171" REF="033601_0172_0FF7A2BCB5912A50"/>kind of practical physiognomy; which renders them more intelligent, and more interesting companions; and is of great∣er consequence in our passage through life, than almost any single accomplish∣ment, as explained in sect. vi. and sect. xxiv. of this work.</P>
<P>Fifthly, where languages are learnt by conversation, as is generally practised in teaching the French language, a school-education properly conducted, is much superior to that of a governess in a private family. And languages are so much easier taught to children by con∣versation than by the abstract rules of grammar, that Mr. Locke is solicitous to have the latin and greek languages taught by conversation in boys' schools; and thinks the time of learning words might thus be much shortened, which now occu∣pies seven or eight years; part of which might be much better employed in acquir∣ing the knowledge of things.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="033601_0173_0FF7A2BE47A65FC0"/>
The Philosopher, who despising the goods of fortune said, "he was rich, though he carried about with him every thing, which he possessed," meant to assert, that strength of mind joined with strength of body, were superior to any other advan∣tages of life. A good education furnishes us with this inestimable treasure; it ac∣companies us at home, travels with us a∣broad; delights us in solitude, graces us in society; comforts us in misfortune, guards us in prosperity; contributes to the happiness of others, and ensures our own.</P>

<P>RUDIMENTS OF TASTE IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM A MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTERS.</P>

<PB REF="033601_0191_0FF7A2E2F098FE88"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more distinguished by the Nobility of her rank, than by the lustre of those vir∣tues which adorned her character—a most pleasing and amiable trait of which shines in that little incident recorded to her im∣mortal honour. A Lady of Ionia coming one day to visit her, impatiently expected to be shewn the splendor and magnificence of her toilette, which she supposed, from her rank and fortune, to be very superb. The illustrious Roman prolonged the con∣versation till her children were at hand, and then introducing them to her visitor—"These, says she, are my jewels."</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="033601_0192_0FF7A2E495B62AA0"/>
The writer of these Letters has so great a veneration for the domestic character of this Lady, that she thinks she cannot do better than give them to the public, under the signature of Cornelia. And whatever their other defects may be, they have this at least to recommend them, that the same sentiments of maternal tenderness which influenced the Roman Matron, gave rise to these epistles, and prompted a fond Mo∣ther to become an Author.</P>

<HEAD>RUDIMENTS OF TASTE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE of happiness is the first propensity of the heart.—It is born with us, and to attempt its suppression were e∣qually fruitless and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happiness he has imprinted on the mind so clear an idea of, has somewhere an existence.</P>
<P>Hitherto you have obeyed the impulse of nature in the artless pursuits of child∣hood; but the time is at hand, when this sweet tranquillity will be interrupted by the bustle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repose in the simple amusements of dressing dolls, pursuing butterflies, or plucking, daisies. Sweet
<PB N="202" REF="033601_0194_0FF7A3C06856B4B8"/>dear delights of innocence: on which, as you climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</P>
<P>But we are not born for ourselves a∣lone; and therefore have duties to per∣form, obligations to discharge, and diffi∣culties to encounter; in the course of which, many a severe check is given to this happiness which we all so ardently seek; yet the desire of it will even acquire strength by the repulse, and there was ne∣ver yet a wretch who had found it dimi∣nished by misfortune. I wish the success of this passion could be shewn as demon∣strable as its existence.</P>
<P>But the truth is, all mankind are run∣ning after the same object, though in such opposite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent testimony, it would be scarcely credible that they had each the same view. Yet it is the fate of most of them to sit down at last, in the very same
<PB N="203" REF="033601_0195_0FF77EBC45D89500"/>disposition which Solomon was in when he complained, rather peevishly it must be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of spirit. Man walks indeed in a vain sha∣dow, and 'tis pitiable to reflect that a being of so transient a duration should yet waste the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitless pursuits, and after all the schemes of the sanguine, and the la∣bours of the active, to find the desired at∣tainment as far off as ever.</P>
<P>But this has been the case of millions, and I am afraid will continue to be so, at least till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all so high an idea, con∣sists: an agreement from which alas, we are at the farthest distance imaginable. And here, my dearest girls, lies the whole of the mistake. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happiness exalted as the mind itself can conceive; but man himself errs in the pursuit of it; some
<PB N="204" REF="033601_0196_0FF77EBFDA831FE8"/>placing it in riches, some in power, scarce∣ly one in an age supposing it to be where it really is—in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>But while the human heart is set on acquirements, in which it can find no sa∣tisfaction if attained, the span of life must necessarily be passed in restless anxieties and melancholy disappointment. It was the aim of philosophy, to draw just esti∣mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the splendor of wealth and power; it taught that the so∣vereign good was to be found in rectitude of will. It would be a shame for us to be at a loss on such an important subject, who have received lessons from a much better master than ever gave lectures in the schools of Athens.</P>
<P>Rest assured that in the exercise of so∣cial and religious duties, the mind will find her solid happiness. Wandering in rest∣less search, like Noah's dove, 'tis here she
<PB N="205" REF="033601_0197_0FF7A2EDDEF074B8"/>finds at length the welcome olive, the branch whose verdure blooms for immor∣tality. Should you doubt the assertion, be prevailed on at least to try the experi∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>PLEASURE has something so allur∣ing in the very name, that it is not sur∣prising it finds so great a number of vota∣ries. On no account would I have you insensible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the most refined delights. These how∣ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by taste and judg∣ment. A taste in pleasure is necessary for the selection of such as are above the en∣quiries of the vulgar, suitable to delicate and refined minds, and correspondent to the noblest sentiments; of course depend∣ant more on intellectual, than on corporeal faculties. Taste never fails to reject what∣ever is gross and sensual; yet even among the more resined pleasures, a sound judg∣ment is wanted, to discriminate the solid
<PB N="207" REF="033601_0199_0FF7A2F442A546D0"/>and rational, from the frivolous and fasti∣dious. The elegant hand of fashionable dissipation has often given a polish to what, in its own nature, can never deserve the name of pleasure.</P>
<P>Under this head must be comprehend∣ed the various species of fashionable amuse∣ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would scarcely suppose such pursuits as these should ever be dig∣nified with the name of pleasure. Yet when numbers are daily seen hazarding, not only extravagant sums, but peace of mind also, at the gaming-table—When the order of nature is inverted, and the re∣freshments of repose are bartered for mid∣night routs, we must conclude that such valuable sacrifices are not made but with the expectation of some supreme pleasure to reward them: how seldom such rewards are found, can best be determined by the testimony of the dissipated and gay, who after they have wasted the most valuable
<PB N="208" REF="033601_0200_0FF7A2F5D29AAE18"/>blessings of life, as time, health, spirits, &amp;c. will generally confess that they have never found the satisfactions they sought after.</P>
<P>To be able to divest real enjoyment from the false glosses the world has put up∣on it, is a piece of wisdom becoming a philosopher; but it is a piece of wisdom, you my dear girls, must also acquire, if you expect to be happy. Fashion has ar∣rogated to itself the prerogative of fixing the criterion of pleasure; but fashion is often a dangerous director, and is at best an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually biassing the natural disposition of another; if therefore what is called amusement be not agreeable to the real turn of the mind, it ceases to be viewed in that light, and can only be considered as an irksome conformity to the tastes of others.</P>
<P>Yet, abject as such a submission un∣doubtedly is, there are thousands who vo∣luntarily
<PB N="209" REF="033601_0201_0FF7A2F75EF848A0"/>yield to it who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like them∣selves, but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected sin∣gularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol fashion breaks in upon the rules of virtue, as it too often does, or the true enjoyment of life, this is so mean a slavery that a rational being might be ex∣pected to despise it.</P>
<P>When therefore reason and religion have given the clue to your pleasures, re∣solve always to have them of your own chusing, and not of other people's. The sanction of numbers is the cause that draws youth from virtue and happiness: reason, when aided by a proper education, would, if left to herself, point out the way to both.</P>
<P>There are pleasures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and sublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated tasle.
<PB N="210" REF="033601_0202_0FF7A2F8EDE69C40"/>Did you ever discharge a social duty, but upon looking into your heart, you there perceived a glow of satisfaction? But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous sensations, give full scope to the impulses of benevolence; try what it is to heal the broken-hearted; diffuse joy through the mansions of sorrow, and rescue merit from the pressure of indigence and misfortune. —These employments are capable of yielding pleasures suitable to the most ex∣alted capacities, boundless as the most san∣guine imagination can paint them.</P>
<P>But if so vast a multitude have erred in the pursuit of pleasure, through levity, not an inconsiderable number, of a very oppo∣site temper, are at equally as great a dis∣tance from it: these are the morose and cynical, who will not condescend to the sober satisfactions that are to be found in a domestic circle, where the social affections are cultivated: if the gay and volatile mis∣take the nature of pleasure, these seem to
<PB N="211" REF="033601_0203_0FF7A2FC98733760"/>question its very existence, and pass thro' life without stooping to pick up even one of the fair blossoms which nature has scat∣tered in the way.</P>
<P>Ever be your hearts open to the sweet emotions of social love, and you will not have cause to complain that the path of human life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</P>
<P>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happiness; the amusing, the interesting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eternal variety, order, and beauty; a thou∣sand charms await the mind which possesses a taste for simple pleasures; to such the whole creation is a boundless source of rational amusements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be pleased with art∣less nature, and contemplate, with delight, the noble imagery with which she abounds. For my part, I should desire no greater
<PB N="212" REF="033601_0204_0FF7A2FF0BB91940"/>proof of the purity and elegance of your taste, than to hear you speak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood, the beauty of a lawn, or any of those charming rural scenes which are so often over-looked, for the far less nobler productions of art.</P>
<P>Esteem me ever the most affectionate of your friends.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<PB REF="033601_0205_0FF7A300991F0F90"/>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one knows that human life is exposed to various miseries; but every one does not know, at least does not con∣sider, that the far greater part of these mi∣series spring from the passions: yet the passions, you reply, are implanted in us by nature—we cannot eradicate them.</P>
<P>That is true; you cannot eradicate the passions, nor is it expedient you should; for as we are the workmanship of Infinite Wisdom, so doubtlessly the propensities He has formed us with, are in themselves very good; but then their good or ill ten∣dency must be determined by this single question, Whether they govern us, or we govern them? In the latter case they re∣semble those salutary breezes, which waft health and sweetness on their wings: in
<PB N="214" REF="033601_0206_0FF7A303222D8300"/>the former they may be compared to cer∣tain hurricanes, which tear up all before them, and deform the beauteous aspect of the most luxuriant climates. There is more felicity to be found in the world than is often supposed; but never let us pretend to look for it before we have si∣lenced the passions; the perpetual con∣tention we must have with them will else interrupt our successful search.</P>
<P>Pride, my dear girls, is a vice that springs up in the mind, almost without her attending to it: its characters are an im∣moderate self-love, conceitedness, and ar∣rogance, with a profound contempt of every other person; ever insatiable in its desire of respect, extremely susceptible of the slightest affronts, and jealous of the least tribute of applause paid to another. Persons of this cast cannot in the nature of things be happy, as they may be said to live in a state of hostility with all the world; like Ishmael, they have their hands against
<PB N="215" REF="033601_0207_0FF7A3059B2F8C88"/>every man, and every man's hand is against them.</P>
<P>Ambition condemns its wretched vo∣tary to forego the sweets of content and pre∣sent ease, for the uneasy dreams of rank and power. It is happy for the world when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their desires are perpetu∣ally aspiring. Innumerable are the hor∣rid deeds, which the historic page records, that have been perpetrated by the impulse of this restless passion; yet if in pity to mankind, its direful effects are restrained, still the bosom where it rages must be a prey to inexpressible agonies.</P>
<P>Envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition: it has very aptly been com∣pared to a vulture preying on the vitals, and there could not possibly have been de∣vised a more expressive similitude. That mind which is capable of regarding with the least degree of regret, the more fortu∣nate
<PB N="216" REF="033601_0208_0FF7A30817FEE608"/>acquirements of another as a per∣petual source of disquietude and must ever pine beneath the inexpressible misery, which is both the consequence and the pu∣nishment of so base a propensity. As en∣vy is the meanest of all the passions, so in its own nature it is the most opposite to happiness.</P>
<P>Covetousness is a vice that absorbs eve∣ry finer feeling of the soul. Whatever sordid satisfaction the miser may feel in a∣massing his treasures, yet the cares which unavoidably attend it, and the solicitude the preservation of it demands, more than balance the selfish gratification. He knows nothing of the sweet emotions of charity and benevolence, and must be ever a stran∣ger to the noble sensations they excite.—It is well if the suggestions of his bound∣less avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The honesty of a covetous person can be but doubtful at the best.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="033601_0209_0FF7A309A5B050C0"/>
A revengeful disposition is as dreadful to society as burdensome to itself: it is the whirlwind of the soul, which under its dominion resembles a fury of the in∣fernal regions. What sad catastrophes have been effected by revenge! what in∣expressible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</P>
<P>It is easy to perceive, by the slightest glance, that every one of the passions here enumerated are totally destructive of peace: there can be no such thing as tranquillity in the breast which they inhabit. Let it, then, be the care of my dearest girls, to guard against the fatal ascendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more lamen∣table object than a human being who sub∣mits to become the sport of passions: a barque in a storm, driven by winds, and shattered by the tempest, exhibits but a faint picture of such a wretch, whose days pass in continual anguish; he looks for peace, but finds despair; casts oblique re∣flections
<PB N="218" REF="033601_0210_0FF7A30B36D53758"/>on the wisdom and goodness of Providence; distrusts his attributes; cuff∣es his own being and dies if possible more wretched than he lived.</P>
<P>The infinitely wise and good Creator saw the abundant evil that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the pas∣sions, and therefore in his goodness deter∣mined at an appointed time to promulgate a religion, the aim of which should be to regulate the passions, and direct them to their proper channel; such is the Chris∣tian revelation; in its ends and nature an antidote to moral evil.</P>
<P>Perhaps the natural passions of the hu∣man mind may be reduced to two—the love of pleasure and the love of praise; and from the corruptions of these may be traced every irregular affection of the heart—when men no longer knew the true source from whence to look for happiness, or approbation, it is not much wonder it
<PB N="219" REF="033601_0211_0FF7A30EDBBF0700"/>should be sought in power, riches and pre∣eminence; not that the love of these should branch into self-love, vain glory, and all the other evil passions, which cause so much misery in the world.</P>
<P>The regulation of the heart and its de∣sires, is a point then of the utmost impor∣tance, since on it depends your present peace and eternal glory. "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life." And when you have repelled the approach of any passion, guard still more effectually against its en∣trance, by endeavouring to establish in your mind the contrary virtue;—as for in∣stance, subdue pride and cherish humility; guard against the desire of power and rich∣es, by attaining that poverty of spirit which is content with little, and desires no ap∣plause but that of Heaven.</P>
<P>Never lose sight of this truth—that there is no happiness adequate to the ca∣pacities
<PB N="220" REF="033601_0212_0FF7A311603842B0"/>of the human soul, but what is found in the exercise of piety and virtue; nor any praise worthy her regard, but what results immediately therefrom.</P>

<P>THE most glorious conquest you can possibly obtain is that of yourselves. So∣lomon was of opinion, that he who could govern his own spirit, had attained a much higher point of dominion, than if he should rule a kingdom. It is certainly much easier to give wise and upright laws to others, than to obey them ourselves; and when you can controul your own in∣clination, you will have learned the whole essence of moral philosophy.</P>
<P>But a negative virtue is not all that is to be attained, although thousands content with it, maintain through life the character of good sort of people.—The epithet, however, contains no very high eulogium, those good kind of folks seldom rise above a mediocrity in goodness. It certainly is
<PB N="222" REF="033601_0214_0FF7A315691833E0"/>not sufficient to abstain from evil, a chris∣tian must be distinguished by active virtue.</P>
<P>The Christian religion is a beautiful comment on the moral law. The priest who passed by the wounded Jew, was, for aught we are told to the contrary, a very good sort of man, and had some sentiments of compassion, for he went and <HI>looked</HI> on the poor creature, and no doubt kindly <HI>wished</HI> it had been in his power to relieve him; but the good, the benevolent Sama∣ritan, was the generous, <HI>active</HI> friend, whose character will never be read without being admired. The lawyer also possessed a tolerable share of negative merit, having always kept the commandments; yet says our Saviour, thou lackest one thing—that heroic benevolence, which disregards all attention to selfish gratification, in the no∣ble ardour with which it contributes to the necessities of mankind.</P>
<P>These instances are fine illustrations of the Mosaic dispensation, and eminently
<PB N="223" REF="033601_0215_0FF7A317EB49E0F0"/>tend to exalt human nature to the highest possible perfection. It is not enough, say the gospel tenets, that ye refrain from ac∣tual violence to any one—you shall love your enemies, and do good to those that hate you. Severe injunction!—yet you see by it to how refined a pitch the virtue of a christian must aspire.</P>
<P>Do not then rest satisfied with being as just or kind as the letter of the law exacts—be actively good, and seek occasions of exercising your kindness and charity—to administer as far as we are able to the wants of our fellow creatures—to reclaim the vicious—to vindicate the character of the injured—assert the claims of the friend∣less and oppressed—reconcile differences, and be indefatigable in the promotion of peace and happiness to all within the com∣pass of our ability, are employments wor∣thy of a rational being.</P>
<P>There are many cases that occur in life, wherein those who will obey only the
<PB N="224" REF="033601_0216_0FF7A31AA38F9B70"/>rules of legal justice, must fall short of those notions of honesty, which natural reason and conscience suggest; as a good mind wants not the bonds of human laws, so on some occasions it rises to a generosi∣ty that is superior to their narrow limits. Obey the innate ideas of rectitude which God himself has stamped on the human soul—and think it not sufficient to be just, except you are generous also.</P>
<P>Let your conduct be regulated by the nicest rules of propriety and prudence; and let your bosoms glow with the enthu∣siasm of virtue, that you may ever shine forth the steady, zealous friend, the bene∣volently active neighbour, and the truly useful member of society; considering yourselves as citizens of the world, whose only business it is to do good.</P>

<P>BUT so exalted and refined a turn of sentiment is never the production of ignorance. It is only in cultivated minds we must look for it; for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the soil that has never been broken up by moral instruc∣tion. A virtuous and intelligent friend is perhaps the most valuable acquisition a young person can make; but as one of this description may never sall to your lot, supply the want thereof, as well as you can, by books.</P>
<P>By all means cultivate a taste for reading, but take care that your taste be a just one—that is, be more desirous of instruction than amusement or you will profit but little by literary pursuits. Those who read merely to please the
<PB N="226" REF="033601_0218_0FF7A31DC64817E0"/>imagination, may be sure of not reading to advantage, and do seldom acquire a relish for works of solid merit and utility. I have never known a young person who was passionately fond of novels capable of relishing any thing superior to them. For my own part, I had rather see a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet, than at∣tached to that species of writing; for I am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cause, than from any other. The senti∣ments and ideas they impress, are fatal illusions to mislead the poor reader, who, after wasting days and years in the study, is still an utter stranger to the world she lives in—and, what is worse, inspired with the most erroneous notions of it, which commonly lead to some false step, or ill-judged connection, that secures her a wretch for life. It cannot be other∣wise—for the scenes, characters, and in∣cidents, these books describe, are to be found no where but in the author's ro∣mantic
<PB N="227" REF="033601_0219_0FF7A32232960AF0"/>fancy. They have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world; and consequently, those who think to steer through it by such guides, must, in the end, find themselves mistaken. Just as well may a traveller think to make the tour of Europe by a chart of Asia.</P>
<P>If curiosity must be amused, and the imagination pleased, why may not the understanding be improved at the same time? This is very practicable, for there are many works of genius extreme∣ly well calculated to answer each of these ends; but they are not the histo∣ries of Sir such a one, Miss what d'ye call um, or any of those futile produc∣tions, which the press daily emits, to vi∣tiate the taste, and corrupt the princi∣ples of the age.</P>
<P>There is a certain mental vigour ne∣cessary to virtue as well as to happiness, but modern novels, under the specious
<PB N="228" REF="033601_0220_0FF7A323C364A318"/>mask of refined sentiments, introduce a dangerous softness that has often destroy∣ed both. True refinement is the glory of a rational creature, but whatever en∣ervates the mind, must debase it. Ly∣curgus thought so, I suppose, when he banished the poets from his common∣wealth; yet surely he lived near enough to Athens to have learned to draw a proper line between ferocity and effemi∣nacy.</P>
<P>The passion for novelty, so inherent in youth, may be abundantly gratified, by the study of history. Here you meet with new and uncommon events—be∣come acquainted with a variety of cha∣racters, and are enabled to form a just estimate of mankind; for except allow∣ing for a few local customs or prejudi∣ces, human nature was the same two thousand years ago as at this time. There is something extremely agreeable to the mind in weighing and examining the
<PB N="229" REF="033601_0221_0FF7A3254F86B370"/>actions of celebrated personages, who, in their day, made the mighty tremble—in marking the rise or fall of empires, and to be able to determine the secret causes of those revolutions which once astonished the world.</P>
<P>The ages appear as inconsiderable points, to those who are acquainted with history—they see the various nations of the earth pass in review before them, and trace a more than human power busy in the affairs of men—by taking in at one com∣prehensive view so vast a tract of time, they discern the nice connections of that scheme of Providence, which often appears broken and irregular, when contemplated only through the medium of a few years.</P>
<P>It is almost impossible to be well versed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity, without watching something of that magnanimity which distinguished them; and I know not why an acquaint∣ance
<PB N="230" REF="033601_0222_0FF7A326DF89E9E0"/>with their manners should not be thought as necessary in the system of FE∣MALE EDUCATION, as it usually is in that of the other sex. If the Greek and Ro∣man veterans displayed qualities which the heroes of the present day would be proud to imitate, their wives and daugh∣ters were often patterns of such virtue, as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century.</P>
<P>Read modern history as well as antient—the knowledge of the nations who inha∣bit the globe as well as yourselves, is amus∣ing and interesting—the heart, too, may be the better for it—narrow prejudices are removed, and the better mankind be∣come acquainted with each other, the more the divine principle of philanthropy must be extended. National enmity has no other parent but ignorance—the enlight∣ened, the philosophic mind, even through the veil of different tongues and customs, can discern a kindred being—a mem∣ber
<PB N="231" REF="033601_0223_0FF7A32A9262A658"/>of that universal family, whose head is the Deity.</P>
<P>Next to travelling itself, nothing tends more to enlarge the ideas than journals of travels and voyages, if the writers have been faithful and accurate; and you will read them with infinite pleasure, if you have been careful to acquire a knowledge of geography. This renders you familiar with the countries you read of—You re∣collect their soil, climate, and productions —know their respective boundaries, and can readily mark out their place on the globe.</P>
<P>Having thus, my dear girls, pointed out to you so exhaustless a source of amuse∣ment, I will only for the present add, that I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS long as curiosity continues a leading feature in the human character, Biography will form a favourite species of reading. Every body is eager to pry into the private character of a celebrated per∣sonage, and are better pleased to know, how such an one acts in domestic life, than in the senate, or the field. And, indeed, it is there that the best estimate of the real description can be formed.</P>
<P>The private lives of famous persons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanness too often there displayed, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of popularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the desire of fame alone. If on the other hand, by following these darlings of fame to the clo∣set,
<PB N="233" REF="033601_0225_0FF7A32EA2312C80"/>or the fire-side, we discover the same nobleness of heart that distinguishes them with the multitude, justly they become patterns for our example; the mind re∣joices to find something about them that is <HI>imitable,</HI> for though few are called forth as distinguished actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they please, be <HI>great</HI> in private life: That is, may acquire those amiable qualities of mind, which can on∣ly constitute real greatness; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of royalty, but a tinsel or∣nament to cover real meanness.</P>
<P>Your chief aim should be the know∣ledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully discovered in trifling traits and circumstances, than by impor∣tant actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human na∣ture so impartially delineated, as in the sacred writings. There the historians, neither influenced by passion nor preju∣dice,
<PB N="234" REF="033601_0226_0FF7A33140ECB5A8"/>relate both actions and their se∣cret springs with unerring candour; never calumniating enemies, or stooping to flat∣ter the favourites of their nation.</P>
<P>The Jewish writers had the fairest op∣portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, considering the miraculous powers so often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of David with Goliah, would have been thought by a Pagan writer, sufficient grounds for exalting his favorite to a God: yet the inspired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the inequality of humanity; sometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Seraphim;—at others, enslaved by the meanest passions. Such instances of can∣dour, considered with the national pride of the Jews, leave no room to doubt the veracity of the sacred penman on any oc∣casion.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="033601_0227_0FF7A334303F93E8"/>
The scriptures also finely illustrate many parts of profane history: we are told of embattled armies, and cities level∣led with the dust; but it is only in holy writ we find those armies prophetically marshalled, and that destruction denoun∣ced perhaps an hundred years before the event. These are instances which im∣press the mind with reverence for the sa∣cred records, and fill it with august ideas of the eternal Providence.</P>
<P>The works of our best moralists will not be unentertaining to you, if your taste for reading be as good as I wish it. A∣mongst the productions of this kind, are the Spectator and the Rambler; as conspi∣cuous for the elegance of their language, as the soundness of their morality. But there are no better rules for the moral con∣duct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though composed so many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by those
<PB N="236" REF="033601_0228_0FF7A336C32F2B98"/>who would pass through life happily and and respect.</P>
<P>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it. There is a kind of versification that tends to debase the mind;—wherever immortality or in∣delicacy is found, such must ever be the effect. Elegance of numbers though a re∣quisite, is yet the lowest recommendation of good poetry;—its characteristics are dignity of thought, purity of expression, and, above all, the best principles of piety and morality. For this reason, those poe∣tical pieces extant in the Bible, are by good judges, allowed to be truly sublime. Poet∣ry in its original state, being only the har∣monious effusions of a mind glowing with elevated sentiments of generosity, gratitude and devotion. Many of the Psalms are noble compositions, and neither for beau∣ty of figure, or energy of expression, have ever been excelled.</P>

Natural history affords a delightful stu∣dy—it is not however expected that you should have a systematic idea of every ve∣getable, animal, or insect; but it is un∣pardonable, for one who is blest with lei∣sure and opportunity, not to have at least a general knowledge of the most conspicu∣ous of Nature's works:—to be ignorant of the beauty and properties of those, is to wander over the fair creation, as Thomson expresses it, "with brute unconscious gaze." The curious and intelligent spec∣tator finds the variegated face of nature, a source of rational amusement, and reads in glowing characters the wisdom of the Deity. It is not in such pursuits that the human mind acquires those illiberal sen∣timents which so often disgrace it;—all it here finds is noble and beneficent, worthy that Divine Author, whom to know and a∣dore, in the proper glory of an intelligent being.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the accomplishments necessary to the female character, I think needle work may claim the first place, it having so close a connection with neatness which is indisputably requisite to render you comfortable to yourselves, or amiable in the esteem of others. The ladies of the last century certainly held needle-work in much greater estimation than those of the present; witness the many laborious performances that yet remain as proofs of their amazing industry in this respect—but the world is ever prone to extremes, and because this art was then pursued to the exclusion of every intellectual accom∣plishment, there are many in our days who seem to think it beneath their study or ambition.</P>
<P>The Mahometan sentiment which pre∣vailed some years ago, of the inferiority of the female mind, seems exploded in this
<PB N="241" REF="033601_0233_0FF7A341790A8A00"/>age of universal refinement: and a wo∣man of cultivated understanding is no longer a phenomenon. The paths of knowledge are rendered accessible—men of learning have stooped from the eleva∣tions of science to accelerate the improve∣ments of the other sex—they abridge, com∣pile, explain for their assistance and ad∣vancement in polite literature.</P>
<P>Make all the use you possibly can of such advantages, and be convinced that the cultivation of the mind will exalt you in the estimation of rational beings—will open to you exhaustless sources of amuse∣ment and delight, of which the ignorant can have no conception. Yet be careful, my dear girls, never to overlook one femi∣nine grace or accomplishment. There is a line of character drawn between the sex∣es, which neither can pass without becom∣ing contemptible. It is not to make you despise those acquirements which have ever been appropriated to the female sex, that
<PB N="242" REF="033601_0234_0FF7A34319072E48"/>you are incited to mental attainments, but to render you still more valuable as wo∣men; and the better your minds are cul∣tivated, the more you will see the proprie∣ty of attending to those minutiae which be∣come the condition in which Providence has placed you.</P>
<P>I do not see how you can acquit your∣selves tolerably in domestic life, without a knowledge of needle-work; but granting your rank and fortune may place you above the absolute necessity of learning that part of it which is called plain work—yet con∣sider how far the ornamental kinds may be of use to amuse the intervals of pleasures, or other pursuits, as well as to promote the display of an elegant taste. Even our in∣nocent amusements require variation, and the mind may be agreeably relieved, by imitating with the needle the beautiful productions of nature—but there is some∣thing which places a skill in needle work in a much more important point of view,
<PB N="243" REF="033601_0235_0FF7A347A7EE6598"/>and that is, the inconstancy of fortune, which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel those, whom once she smiled on, to procure their subsistence by those very arts which were acquired only for amusement.—Whatever may be a resource against that mutability which marks all human affairs, becomes an object of importance.</P>
<P>A proficiency in the arts of domestic management and oeconomy, ought justly to be ranked among the accomplishments of a young lady. You must be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good house∣wifery. Some girls have I known profess so violent an attachment to literary pur∣suits, that they are content to remain igno∣rant of common attainments. This shews a pitiable weakness—elevated minds are attentive to every thing; and, believe me, it is very possible to possess a competent knowledge of polite literature, and be well versed in the methods of well governing a
<PB N="244" REF="033601_0236_0FF7A34934A48C18"/>house at the same time—the latter quali∣fications have of themselves constituted many an useful character in female life, which is more than can be said of the for∣mer. Blend, therefore, my beloved girls, <HI>polite</HI> with <HI>useful</HI> acquirements, and you will be what I wish you.</P>
<P>In writing, acquire, if possible, a good hand, yet that is not so essentially necessary as the being able to write grammatically—the violation of the <HI>common</HI> rules of gram∣mar, is an indisputable mark of low breed∣ing; and although my Lord Chesterfield sarcastically said that bad spelling was only allowable in a woman, it certainly is not allowable in any one, who pretends to an education above the vulgar. Could you write as fine a hand as even A—n him∣self, bad spelling would disgrace the whole. The substituting <HI>have</HI> for <HI>has, are</HI> for <HI>is,</HI> &amp;c. infallibly sinks you in the estimation of well bred persons. In order to avoid errors of this kind, habit is to be particu∣larly
<PB N="245" REF="033601_0237_0FF7A34ACAFAC698"/>guarded against. If in your early years you are not careful to write and spell correctly, it is a thousand to one if you ever do. You see, therefore, of what con∣sequence it is that you pay a present atten∣tion to these points.</P>
<P>I reckon among the useful attainments, the ability of penning an epistle with pro∣priety and elegance—many fortunate cir∣cumstances in life may be facilitated there∣by—a well written letter has often effect∣ed what verbal requests have sought in vain—besides this consideration, how great∣ly must the sweet intercourse of friendship be improved by a free and intelligent cor∣respondence! Two friends, though placed at the extremities of the globe, may thus enjoy all the pleasures of such a connec∣tion; but except you attain the desirable habit of expressing your sentiments with∣out embarrassment, hope not to enjoy any thing of so delicate a satisfaction. Letters should be the pictures of the soul; and so
<PB N="246" REF="033601_0238_0FF7A34C89FD2100"/>they always would be if people acquired only the skill of expressing their thoughts just as they arise. Write as you would speak, were the persons you address imme∣diately before you. There is no more than this necessary to establish that easiness of style which is the chief beauty of epis∣tolary correspondence. That good breed∣ing which I hope will be habitual to you, will dictate those terms and forms of ad∣dress, the condition of those to whom you write requires.—We do not always find the most learned people write the most agreeable letters—perhaps for no other reason than that they take too much trou∣ble about it, and, like the good Archbishop of Benevento, reject the first thought that occurs. Some that I have known indite an epistle in such a stiff and formal style, and load it so disgustfully with tautology, that one would almost take it for an Act of Par∣liament. When you write a letter, my dear girls, forget the idea of pen, ink and paper—suppose only you are speaking to
<PB N="247" REF="033601_0239_0FF7A3510B376620"/>the person, and you will write an <HI>agreea∣ble,</HI> if not a <HI>fine</HI> letter—to effect the latter, something must have been effected by dame Nature—however, this I know— that the most elevated sentiments would not look graceful in such compositions, ex∣cept accompanied by perfect ease and ex∣pression, and have the appearance of flow∣ing spontaneously from the heart. Many excellent models of epistolary writing have been recommended to young proficients. You cannot have better than those ascribed to Pope Ganganelli;—whoever was the author, he has certainly hit on that ease, sprightliness and elegance, which it is my earnest wish may characterise whatever falls from your pen. Would to Heaven that all the world possessed the same can∣dor and liberality of sentiment which breathes through every one of those ele∣gant epistles.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you compare the ankward motions of a rustic, with the genteel and graceful movement of a person of education, you cannot but be assured of the utility of dancing, but it should ne∣ver be forgotten, that to give this supe∣riority of mein and air is the chief end of that polite accomplishment;—to lose sight of this idea, is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel ed∣ucation:—to reduce it to an unimpor∣tant, if not pernicious attainment. How∣ever a knowledge of dancing may some∣times conduce to social pleasure, and in that light be esteemed an agreeable and innocent recreation, I cannot help think∣ing, that the same application that is re∣quisite to form an opera dancer, may very well be dispensed with in a young lady of a different character. The ex∣travagant leaps and gestures of some fa∣shionable
<PB N="249" REF="033601_0241_0FF7A354282A7C68"/>females, make me think of the speech of Philip of Macedon to his son, on another occasion—I am ready to ask if they "are not ashamed to <HI>dance</HI> so well."</P>
<P>There is scarcely a human soul, how∣ever apparently dead to sensibility, but is in some measure alive to the extatic charms of music. The story of Orphe∣us is more than a fable—minds almost as inert and inanimate as trees themselves, have been moved by the power of har∣monious sounds:—why else does the gap∣ing rustic, follow with such manifest de∣light, the itinerant musician; and why but that the effect of music on the pas∣sions is so incontestibly proved, has the army adopted the sons of Apollo with those of Mars? Since then this science has so great an influence on the feelings of the soul, is it not surprizing that the polite world should not be more ambi∣tions of enjoying those sublime sensations,
<PB N="250" REF="033601_0242_0FF7A356D4CDAB18"/>which the best pieces are so abundantly capable of exciting, and not rest poorly satisfied with the luke warm pleasures of sing-song, while the noble compositions of great masters, lie bye totally disre∣garded. Indulge, my dear girls, a turn for music, if nature has given you such; but do not permit a song tune, or an opera air to be the limits of your excel∣lence in that enchanting science.</P>
<P>Drawing, painting, &amp;c. justly form a part of polite education, because they fur∣nish an agreeable, as well as rational amuse∣ment. They lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature, and that can scarce∣ly fail to advance the mind a degree high∣er, even to the contemplation of her Di∣vine Author. But if it had not this hap∣py tendency, drawing is still a laudable a∣musement, because an innocent one; and whatever furnishes a recreation of that character, may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="033601_0243_0FF7A35A6C964E80"/>
An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations, greatly enlarges the mind. It is the property of ignorance to esteem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces; and scarcely to allow that its inhabitants are human. Nothing tends more immediately to remove such illibe∣ral prejudices, than studying the language of the people thus despised. The super∣cilious contemner is surprised to find them rational, and expressing similar ideas with those of his own country.</P>
<P>If necessity or inclination ever leads you from your native land, a previous ac∣quaintance with the language of those you reside among, would much facilitate your pleasure and convenience; would open to you the avenues of social love and friendship, and take off much from those comfortless sensations the mind is apt to feel in the idea of being amongst a people it knows not. For this end, perhaps it may be sufficient to acquire a knowledge
<PB N="252" REF="033601_0244_0FF7A35BFAFAC910"/>of the French tongue, that being general∣ly understood by intelligent persons of every European nation. But there is another advantage attending this branch of polite accomplishment, and which pro∣bably to you, my dear girls will be the most useful—I mean the being able to read in their original, those beautiful composi∣tions which lose many of their excellencies by translation; for this reason become ac∣quainted also with the Itasian: but Ho∣mer and Virgil you tell me have beauties that can never be translated—true, yet these, I fancy, you must be content to taste as pure as the labors of the learned afford them; the Greek and Latin tongues, form∣ing no part in the polite system of female education at present, nor certainly ever can in the <HI>useful.</HI></P>
<P>Arithmetic is a dry study, yet certain∣ly a very useful one, to those who would manage their affairs with oeconomy and prudence;—a thorough knowledge of the
<PB N="253" REF="033601_0245_0FF7A35D8E522EF8"/>four first rules, is sufficient to enable you to do it.</P>
<P>From a total ignorance of letters in female life, we are advanced to an age which requires every girl to be made a grammarian; yet it unfortunately hap∣pens, that of the numbers who profess to have studied the grammar of their na∣tive tongue, few speak or write it with that accuracy which could be wished; indeed the progress that women usually make in that science, is seldom of itself sufficient to give an habitual elegance of expression; they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the best authors, and the conversation of those who have themselves acquired it perfect;—what you can, acquire of grammar by such assistances of these. There is an indis∣pensable necessity for you to write and speak English correctly; acquire that qualification as easily as you can, but nothing will more facilitate it than the methods I have mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="033601_0246_0FF7A35F5A1D5D20"/>
Geography is a study that will please you an hundred times better—this is not like the former, a set of dry rules, but almost every advance you make therein, will abundantly repay your pains by the novelty of the information it produces. Besides, I cannot imagine how the fre∣quent relations that occur in common discourse will be intelligible, without some acquaintance with this study. I am sure if you are no geographer, even a newspaper will be as inexplicable as an Egyptian hieroglyphic. Attain a com∣petent knowledge of the globe on which you live, that your apprehension of infi∣nite wisdom may be enlarged; which it will be in a much higher degree, if you take care to acquire a general idea of the structure of the universe. It is not ex∣pected you should become adepts in astro∣nomy, but a knowledge of its leading principles you may and ought to obtain. The French, with their usual attention to the sex, have procured them a gentle∣man

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>AN accomplished character, has so many charms, that nothing needs be said to induce you to <HI>wish,</HI> at least, for its at∣tainment. Yet painful application must render that wish effectual—a reflection however that should excite your emulation, rather than despondency—trivial acquire∣ments may content the indolent and timid, but the arduous and difficult are the pro∣per aim of elevated minds. Courage be∣longs not to the warrior alone—it is as of∣ten found in the closet, as the field.</P>
<P>That resolution which is necessary for every valuable purpose of life, is the fruit only of active minds, and was never found with indolence and sloth;—determine therefore to conquer every tendency to an inactive temper. Whenever you feel in yourselves an inaptitude for doing what necessarily ought to be done, rouze that
<PB N="257" REF="033601_0249_0FF7A3671C0F45F8"/>moment, or you will give ground to an enemy the most destructive to happiness and virtue; and who once entrenched is hard to be dislodged. Never defer to the next hour, that which should be the busi∣ness of the present. "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it, with all thy might," said a very wise man many hun∣dred years ago; indeed there is no pre∣cept throughout the sacred writings, in∣culcated with greater energy than this of diligence. It is the soul of virtue— the foundation of honor and affluence.</P>
<P>Many a bright and shining talent lies hid in a napkin, for want of activity to unfold it; nor do we unfrequently meet with persons struggling with distresses, which require only their own exertions to remove. Indolence takes hold of the disposition much oftener than is acknow∣ledged; it is possible to be wholly under its dominion, and yet suspect nothing of it; and, what is yet more strange, to be∣lieve
<PB N="258" REF="033601_0250_0FF7A369A0CDFEB8"/>one's self to be the most diligent person in the world at the very time. You have seen numbers of bustling peo∣ple, who are always in a hurry, and so perplexed do they appear with business, as never to be able to enjoy a friend or themselves. It would seem hard at first sight, to accuse them of indolence, and yet they are of all people most com∣monly under its power: for an ha∣bitual diligence would so comfortably arrange the affairs of life, that none would be found to intrude on another. Consi∣der the surprising dispatch with which some in public stations, manage a multi∣plicity of the most important concerns; —to contemplate them, one would al∣most conclude, nothing too extensive for the compass of the human mind;—dili∣gence is the charm which effects it all.</P>
<P>In that dismal catalogue of diseases which imbitter mortality, not a few owe their existence to indolence. The indi∣gent labourer who toils for daily bread,
<PB N="259" REF="033601_0251_0FF7A36B2D92A428"/>knows nothing of that sad train of ner∣vous disorders which render life itself burdensome to the wealthy. In some cases, poverty might justly be called a blessing. Great are the atchievements which resolution and diligence can effect: —in nothing is their power more conspi∣cuously seen, than in the cultivation of the mind; to reflect on the progress of the human understanding—to compare the refinements of philosophy with a state of savage nature—a Newton, with an inhabi∣tant of New Holland, we should almost conclude some supernatural power must have contributed to give the former so in∣finite a superiority in the scale of beings. Without the quality I have recommended it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad∣vantages, such as the being born in an en∣lightened country afford, yet no inconsi∣derable portion of diligence is required to render these advantages personally effec∣tual. It is this, my dear girls, that makes them yours, and without it, the soul will
<PB N="260" REF="033601_0252_0FF7A36EA1695458"/>remain as uninformed as if destined to a land where science never darts a cheering beam.</P>
<P>It may seem strange to tell you of old age, before you have scarcely passed your infancy; yet I must not conceal from you, that a period will arrive, when exterior at∣tractions will be no more:—when mental acquirements will prove your highest lustre and sublimest comfort. However despi∣cable an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life, in the decline of it she is sure to become far more contemptible; at that time it is the improvements she has made in early days, that give dignity of character. An old age of cards necessari∣ly succeeds a youth of folly. Pope could not have said any thing more destructive of the insignificancy of those ancient ha∣bits, than he has expressed in that concise satire. If you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age, you must pass a youth of diligence and application.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="033601_0253_0FF7A37052349948"/>
But then the pleasures resulting from it surpass description, the satisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy possessor; one of them, we are assured, is a noble independence, which creates, if I may so speak, its own happi∣ness; is not indebted to dissipation, or the caprice of others; but can derive from itself, exhaustless resources for solitude or society. Ordinary persons are obliged to fly from Ennui to the regions of amuse∣ment, but superior beings, who have tra∣versed the fields of useful and polite know∣ledge, can from themselves select materi∣als for the most exquisite enjoyment.</P>
<P>Do you think this an acquisition worth desiring—then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in∣dustry. Habits of indolence are destruc∣tive of every valuable attainment, and they are as much so of happiness, as they are known to be of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>CULTIVATED minds have plea∣sures which surpass the vulgar apprehen∣sion. They have their pains as well— for there is an evil peculiar to refined feeling, of which the untaught rustic is happily ignorant. This happens when refinement, or at least the affectation of it, is carried to such an extreme, that it degenerates into false delicacy. The symptoms of the malady are a kind of secret dissatisfaction with every thing— the common blessings of life are despised, as inadequate to the refinement of their ideas, and every petty slight angmented by such a quickness of perception, as leads them to see affronts, when none perhaps have been intended. And this peevish∣ly irritable temper they are pleased to dignify with the name of sensibility, and pique themselves on a disposition that disqualifies them for social virtue or social
<PB N="263" REF="033601_0255_0FF7A3768FCBE260"/>happiness. What pity, that a quality meant to highten every real blessing, should be ascribed to the mere chimera of a sickly brain! Never may you, my dears, by indulging these fictitious feelings, re∣fine away the felicity, which a kind Pro∣vidence scatters in your path of life. Nou∣rish in your bosoms humility and good na∣ture—these will teach you to make the best of your lot, whatever it be, and give a relish to every enjoyment—all is serene where they reside. Humility, by arro∣gating nothing to herself, remains un∣hurt at the supercilious scorn of igno∣rance or pride; and good-nature, by casting a veil over the foibles of others, presents to our view the best side of this motley scene.</P>
<P>Without doubt, superior minds have a quicker sense of what is beautiful in nature, or desirable in life, than a pea∣sant, whose ideas extend not beyond his daily occupations—perhaps they feel al∣so
<PB N="264" REF="033601_0256_0FF7A3781D192860"/>more acutely the evils of their condi∣tion; yet the persons who suffer most by this affected sensicility are not they who have the greatest share of afflictive events, but the idly speculative, who being em∣ployed to no good purpose, have time to nourish those artificial feelings which Nature knows nothing of.</P>
<P>Sensibility!—What is it?—Is it not that delicate perception of natural and moral beauty, which the Creator has implanted in the soul to exalt its happi∣ness, and awaken its noblest passions? How greatly, then, do they err who sub∣stitute in the room of this best gift of Heaven, that which is the very weakness of humanity, pride and peevishness?</P>
<P>It is paying a very poor compliment to literary pursuits, to suppose they are productive of that softness which unfits the mind for enduring the common ac∣cidents of life. And those attainments
<PB N="265" REF="033601_0257_0FF7A379AC6B27A0"/>are of little value that serve no better purpose than to barb the arrows of mis∣fortune with stings which the enlighten∣ed never feel. But probably they who dream of such effects are the superficial, who never dived beyond the surface of literature, and whose feeble intellects are unable to digest even the little they have imbibed.</P>
<P>If you have really made any advance∣ment in mental improvement, it will in∣vigorate the powers of the soul, and in∣spire her with that magnanimity which is certainly necessary to the happiness of a being, who is every moment expos∣ed to sorrow and disappointment. Va∣lue not yourselves on any refinements that are short of this effect.</P>
<P>Some, I know, are even restrained from the exercise of benevolence by this affectation of sensibility; their feelings are too tender to bear with scenes of dis∣tress,
<PB N="266" REF="033601_0258_0FF7A37C381EAB30"/>and too refined for the duties of social life; they therefore keep at an unfriendly distance from society, lest the ignorance or rudeness they there may meet with, should wound their ex∣cessive delicacy; but how is this obey∣ing the injunction of the Apostle, who exhorts us to be kindly affectioned one to another, bearing with each others in∣firmities?</P>
<P>In fine, my dear girls, come to the feast of social life, accompanied by the virtues of humility and charity, and you will not arise dissatisfied from the enter∣tainment.</P>

<P>I HAVE often thought that the great prevalence of vice arises chiefly from a culpable weakness of temper—for there is nothing so amiable in it that it should be followed for its own sake. It is the mere want of resolution that betrays such num∣bers into the dreadful abyss of sin and mi∣sery.</P>
<LG>
<L>"The world's dread laugh</L>
<L>"Scarce e'en the firm Philosopher can bear."</L>
</LG>
<P>But, in my opinion he must be a poor philosopher who cannot, and would have made but a sorry figure in the portico or lyceum.</P>
<P>It is not meant to inculcate to you a boisterous, imperious carriage. May my girls possess every feminine grace and vir∣tue, but these cannot be supported with∣out some portion of resolution. There is
<PB N="268" REF="033601_0260_0FF7A3813AC39440"/>a proper firmness, without which neither virtue, happiness, or dignity of character can be long maintained. Distrust those who extol the soft irresolution of the sex— it is the very rock on which thousands of deluded females have been lost.</P>
<P>Be possessed of the true principles of ho∣nour and rectitude, and dare to adhere to them in spite of solicitation, or that still more powerful means of temptation, ridi∣cule. Establish your opinions on truth and reason, and maintain them, when necessa∣ry, with firmness;—some people give up both their faith and their friends, for want of resolution to defend them.</P>
<Q>Too weak to think, too indolent to chuse.</Q>
<P>In business, and the affairs of life, a proper firmness is indispensably necessary. Those who can be influenced by every ad∣viser, or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, must of course be desultory
<PB N="269" REF="033601_0261_0FF7A382D628A738"/>and unsettled. They affect nothing of con∣sequence, because they know not how to persevere in any undertaking. Obstacles will attend the best concerted schemes, and mankind will ever think differently about them; but the truly wise will await with steady patience the issue of those measures they have been careful to found in pru∣dence and the moral fitness of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they see the path smooth before them, and attain almost a certainty of success. Such will find their lives wasted, before they have determined on the plan of it. Those who best know the state of humanity, will be convinced, that to design prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</P>
<P>Without resolution, it will sometimes be impossible to act agreeably to the dic∣tates of right reason, and virtue, for these are not always the <HI>ton;</HI> and when that is the case, no inconsiderable share of forti∣tude
<PB N="270" REF="033601_0262_0FF7A3854FECACE8"/>is requisite to repel the attacks of ri∣dicule or amusement—nor can the trea∣sures of knowledge be explored, without a portion of it—for, "there is nothing truly valuable to be attained without pains and labour." Dismayed at the prospect, the indolent, as described by Solomon, cry, "a lion is in the street"—Rather may my dear girls be animated with a nobler ar∣dour, to surmount every difficulty which would retard their acquisition of merit and selicity. Parnassus itself was a craggy rock, but then the muses dwelt on its top.</P>
<P>But if resolution be necessary to the attaining whatever is valuable or desirable in life, it is no less so to the supporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong—hence it follows, that the wisest measures do not always meet with suceess, nor can virtue itself prevent the encroach∣ments of affliction—in such circumstances fortitude gives a dignity to suffering, and
<PB N="271" REF="033601_0263_0FF7A387CD01AA88"/>tends also to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the sentiment of the phi∣losopher— <Q>that a good man struggling with adversity, is a sight on which the gods themselves might look down with delight.</Q> However that be, it is certain that such a character never fails to com∣mand the respect and veneration of man∣kind. Magnanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, seems most secure of admi∣ration. The Saviour of the world incul∣cated it, when having forwarned his disci∣ples of their approaching sufferings, he enjoined them to possess their souls in pa∣tience. Patience is amongst the Christian duties, what magnanimity is in the list of heroic virtues. They are synonimous terms—both imply that calm, unshaken fortitude, which is at once characteristic of the hero and the Christian.</P>
<P>But do not conclude this firmness of mind—this laudable resolution is calcula∣ted only to be admired. It is of the high∣est
<PB N="272" REF="033601_0264_0FF7A38A5002DC98"/>actual service to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to sustain the bur∣den of their sufferings, but by opening a way to better prospects. The timid and irresolute sink at the approach of adversity, into a despondency the most unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courage∣ous industry which might render them more tolerable; and therefore, by the na∣ture of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</P>
<P>Cultivate in all circumstances this in∣nate constancy—it will aid you in the at∣tainment of every good and valuable end. In prosperity, will secure you from the corruptions of vanity—impart dignity and serenity to adversity. In fine, you cannot, I think, but be steady in the practice of virtue, if you are firm in the expectation of its rewards.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>MY epistles to you, my dear girls, are written without the least attention to method; their respective subjects have more the appearance of chance, than de∣sign; and therefore, may be justly cal∣led cursory thoughts on various subjects. Young folks, I know, do not love precise rules, and perhaps you deem the irregu∣larity of my letters their chief merit. Al∣low them, however, one more—that of sincerity, and believe that the sentiments they contain, flow from the heart; I be∣lieve, I need not add the word <HI>sponta∣neously.</HI></P>
<P>As I disclaim all methodical arrange∣ment of my subjects, I will here give you my thoughts, on that very important part of female study, dress. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainness, though probably, such a mode
<PB N="274" REF="033601_0266_0FF7A38E62780D08"/>may be found more advantageous to beau∣ty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I shall recommend that which is at once agreeable to fashion, and your own rank and circumstances. To reconcile these three conditions, is no easy task, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female character; few women possess the happy art;—yet those who do, must be allowed a very superior degree of merit. It is no inconsiderable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that she knows how to support a genteel appearance; and yet pay a just regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circumstances re∣quire.</P>
<P>A fantastical and expensive turn in dress, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally regards neatness, is extremely laudable. Resolve to be always neat, or you can ne∣ver be well-dressed:—a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are sufficient to disgrace
<PB N="275" REF="033601_0267_0FF7A390E6A595D0"/>the most splendid apparel. Neatness is al∣ways in your power, and will always ren∣der you respectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery without it is nothing more than a ridiculous glare, which is never seen but with disgust.</P>
<P>Fashion has imposed some general rules, which may innocently be followed under the restrictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compose thern, be less costly than if they belonged to a dutchess. An uncouth, ill-fashioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philosopher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is discovered through a shabby garment—so much are mankind governed by appear∣ance.</P>
<P>"Prithee good Xenocrates (said Plato to his pupil) sacrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac∣complishments
<PB N="276" REF="033601_0268_0FF7A3936AD72DA8"/>complishments might be illustrated and adorned by a polished exterior;—a wise person, it is true, would not make this al∣together the criterion of merit, yet per∣haps, would not readily look for worth be∣neath an ungraceful exterior.</P>
<P>After all, my dear girls, esteem the frivolous, though often troublesome arts of dress, but as a tax you are in some sort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occasions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap∣pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it necessary to conform to insignificant customs, have always re∣garded them in their proper light. The attention such are seen to shew to the idol fashion, is only a good natured condescen∣sion to the weakness of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too trifling to become the objects of their serious cares. The silly and ignor∣ant are they who love dress for its own sake.</P>

<P>NEXT to our own principles, we are to regard those of our companions; for they are almost of as much impor∣tance to us, as by long and intimate ac∣quaintance they generally become our own. Virtuous habits are strengthened by example—so are vicious ones, but in a much higher degree; nothing there∣fore can be a point of greater conse∣quence than the choice of companions.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written on the subject, and every one who has the care of youth, fails not to inculcate the keep∣ing good company;—the only misfor∣tune is, that the term has seldom been sufficiently explained, and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune, till by degrees the ex∣pression is supposed to imply both these qualifications.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="033601_0270_0FF7A3968BE034F8"/>
The result has been the disturbance of all order in social life;—each class of people quitting their own sphere to as∣sociate with those of superior rank; and these again, inspired by the same senti∣ment, repel with scorn the ambitious at∣tempt solicitous only to attract the no∣tice of still greater folks than themselves. Thus in the room of that social amity with which the human heart should over∣flow, it is unhappily divided between the throbbings of ambition, and the pangs of offended pride.</P>
<P>It is evident, that in this bustle, great∣er attention is paid to the accidental cir∣cumstances of rank and affluence, than to real merit; we should not else so of∣ten see people of the middling rank, when flattered by the notice of a supe∣rior, so elated with the honour of keep∣ing, what they call good company; when perhaps, that superior is conspicu∣ous for almost every vice and meanness.
<PB N="279" REF="033601_0271_0FF7A39B079A2AC0"/>This is a grand mistake surely—as fatal to happiness, as to morals.</P>
<P>Good company can only mean persons of noble sentiments, refined manners, and enlightened understandings. But these qualities are not to be expected, where the scantiness of fortune, has absolutely exclud∣ed the means of education; for the human mind becomes every thing by culture. It is therefore found, that in the lower ranks of society, where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ, the worst habits, and most depraved morals prevail; for this reason you are not to chuse companions from such a class.</P>
<P>In fine, your associates must be those of a liberal and virtuous education. It may happen you may find a friend of this description, whose relative or necessary connection, may not be eligible for you. In this case she is by no means a proper companion, as her own merit, however
<PB N="280" REF="033601_0272_0FF7A39C944F14D8"/>great, will not compensate for the danger you incur in frequently mingling with per∣sons of improper character.</P>
<P>A cultivated mind is the proper soil for every moral and social virtue—it is most likely to be found where Heaven has bestowed an easy fortune, consequently the genteeler ranks of life will be most likely to afford you proper companions. But here let merit alone, and not adven∣titious circumstances, influence your selec∣tion—despise that contemptible weakness which piques itself on the rank, rather than the mental value of an acquaintance; and never let a principle of vanity lead you to the servile imitation of vice or folly, how∣ever sanctioned by wealth or titles. Little minds are ever dazzled by shew and splen∣dour— it is the property of the enlighten∣ed only to distinguish personal worth from external advantages. I should think you disgraced by an acquaintance with an Em∣press, if she was not as much distinguished by virtue as power.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="033601_0273_0FF7A39E1FF4B5B8"/>
Be careful not to form an acquaintance too hastily—many a virtuous girl has funk for ever in the esteem of the world, by be∣ing seen in company with those of doubt∣ful reputation. In vain she declares her ignorance of the real character of her com∣panions. She having admitted them to her society without the requisite investi∣gation of that point, infallibly renders her own prudence suspected.</P>
<P>A very extensive acquaintance is not necessary to social happiness. A few se∣lect friends will most conduce to that end; and it is among these that
<Q>"The free full converse of the friendly heart"</Q>
flows with uninterruption and delight— unfeigned chearfulness and real enjoy∣ment exist much oftener in these little circles, than in large and ceremonious as∣semblies. But should your station in life render a large acquaintance unavoidable,
<PB N="282" REF="033601_0274_0FF7A39FB0667508"/>you will observe to all, a free unrestrain∣ed politeness, without admitting every one indiscriminately to your confidence. Be ever frank and easy, without revealing your own secrets, or those of your friends, and make none your intimates but those of worth and honour.</P>
<P>Much, very much of human happiness depends on the proper choice of acquain∣tance —an ill chosen friend has power to mar our felicity as much as an amiable and faithful one contributes to it. The heart is formed for social intercourse; and when that intercourse is founded on the moral, and religious virtues, it gives a zest to the other enjoyments of life.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain restrictions ne∣cessary to render the gift of speech what the great Creator designed it—a princi∣pal means of happiness to his rationl crea∣tures. The first of these is an habitual care never to violate the laws of truth. The pleasures resulting from mutual con∣versation vanish entirely, when no de∣pendence can be placed in the speaker's veracity. Those who speak merely from the suggestions of imagination, or, what is worse, malignity, are justly charge∣able with half the strife that disturbs the peace of society. Such persons are the most dangerous companions, and need only to be known to be generally dispis∣ed and avoided. Indeed, so high a re∣gard veracity obtains among people of refinement, that you cannot offer a more gross affront than to accuse them of the violation of it.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="033601_0276_0FF7A3A5B711FDF0"/>
Of all that has been said in admira∣tion of Cato's character, nothing reflects so great a lustre on it, as that striking, though tacit eulogium, bestowed on him in one of the Roman Courts of Judica∣ture, where a cause being to be tried which required two witnesses, and one only appearing, the Judge declared he could not dispense with the law, even <HI>though Cato himself were the witness.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, as Archbishop Tillotson fine∣ly observes, a constant adherence to truth has the least trouble and difficulty in it, it sits always upon the lips; where∣as a lye is troublesome, and needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>Next to the character of a liar, that of the detracter is the most odious—a habit of traducing the reputation of others, by speaking all the ill we have heard of them, or putting the worst con∣structions on their actions, is totally op∣posite
<PB N="285" REF="033601_0277_0FF7A3A746C2FCD0"/>to the spirit of Christianity, which breathes nothing but candour and cha∣rity. There is also something extreme∣ly mean in the practice, as the accused persons have seldom an opportunity of refuting the charge. The cruel asper∣sion is borne on the wings of scandal from circle to circle, nor perhaps reach∣es the injured party till the wound given to reputation is too deep for cure.</P>
<P>Barbarous as such a custom is, I need not say how greatly it prevails in almost all companies. I have, however, the charity to believe it does not always pro∣ceed from malice or envy. When no knowledge has been treasured up in the mind—no useful information acquired, conversation cannot receive aid from in∣tellectual stores—what then, must be∣come of it?—must it flag and silence—dreadful silence reign?—No, something must re-kindle it; and when no ration∣al subject arises, that something must be
<PB N="286" REF="033601_0278_0FF7A3A8D80830F0"/>scandal. This, though it may be a pal∣liation of the crime, is yet no excuse; for the wounds given by unmeaning ig∣norance are as deep as those inflicted by premeditated rancour. How shameful is it that an impertinent eagerness for talking should thus wantonly explore the secret recesses of domestic life, and presume to judge of actions, the motives of which cannot be scanned by these ig∣norant prattlers!</P>
<P>The most effectual way to secure yourselves from the commission of this vice, will be the adorning your minds with such acquisitions of knowledge, and useful intelligence, as will enable you to furnish subjects for conversation, with∣out descending to frivolity or detraction. But should you not be so happy as to pos∣sess these desirable resources, I hope you will have so much candour and good-nature as to be content with being ac∣counted a dull and lifeless companion, rather than indulge an eagerness for talk∣ing
<PB N="287" REF="033601_0279_0FF7A3AD670E5638"/>at the expence of other people's good name.</P>
<P>Detraction is not only a violation of the rules of religion, but is also so impo∣litic a crime, as no one who wishes to be well received in the world would ever commit—for a person who is ad∣dicted to scandal, is a terror to society; the respect they receive, resembles the homage the Indians are said to pay to the Devil, rather to evade his maligni∣ty, than procure his love. And how∣ever curiosity may, for a while, listen to an ill-natured anecdote, yet be assur∣ed, the relator is regarded with a secret disgust by every benevolent person, who naturally expects to meet the same cen∣sorious fate, when opportunity serves.</P>
<P>Good policy will therefore correct a censorious disposition; yet, I trust your restraint will be derived from a superior motive, namely, the obligations of reli∣gion, which forbid to speak evil of any,
<PB N="288" REF="033601_0280_0FF7A3AEF40959A0"/>or to judge uncharitably of another. The consciousness of having always obeyed these divine injunctions, will afford the consolation, under the pain you may perhaps feel from the unjust aspersions of others—for such, probably, you will meet with in your journey of life, as no innocence can always be a defence from unmerited censure; and when this chan∣ces to be your case, you will derive un∣speakable comfort, from the reflection of having treated the world more gene∣rously than it has treated you.</P>
<P>Whatever you say, should be meant for the entertainment or instruction of the company, rather than the gratifica∣tion of vanity. Many are so much actu∣ated by self-love, that they never speak or act, but to be applauded. Hence ari∣ses affectation—the most disgusting qua∣lity in nature. Diliver your sentiments as they occur, without affecting more graces in your tone or gesture than
<PB N="289" REF="033601_0281_0FF7A3B085DEE630"/>are your own—these, well managed, will be enough to render you amiable. All may be agreeable in their natural sphere, but when they innovate on that of others, the attempt is commonly frustrated.</P>
<P>Above all, never affect that kind of wit which aims at severe retorts and re∣partee—it has generally ill-nature for its basis, and seldom makes a sally but it procures an enemy, if it does not lose a friend. There is nothing in it to be ad∣mired but the readiness of thought, which gives it birth—but when the qua∣lity seems <HI>aimed</HI> at, rather than <HI>possessed,</HI> it is absolutely contemptible.</P>
<P>In fine—sincerity, candour, and good sense, must be the ornaments of your conversation. Politeness will give an agreeable lustre to these qualities, but remember, it can never be a substitute for them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>"HAIL politeness, power divine!" says the sonnet, and surely no necessary invocation; for politeness, dear girls, is the friend of social happiness and dome∣stic peace; if it was the fashion, in this age, to have household gods, I would surely give it a pre-eminent place amongst them.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but peo∣ple seem to think, they are obliged to be polite every where but at home—and there it is they are most required to be so; for the refined satisfaction of so∣cial intercourse, cannot long subsist with∣out it. I am convinced, that domestic quarrels and disgusts, would much sel∣domer arise, if the parties were always as polite as affectionate.</P>
<P>But what is politeness—is it the law of fashion, or a system of rules?—No—it
<PB N="291" REF="033601_0283_0FF7A3B6EB1F4A98"/>is the divine principle of benevolence, branched into a thousand little chan∣nels, and flowing through all the mi∣nutiae of human life. Education may improve, but can never give it, for it must be founded in the soul, or is never seen in full perfection. A painter may learn the rules of design, and the com∣pendium of colours; but if he possesses not the enthusiasm of the art, his pic∣tures will be lifeless and insipid.</P>
<P>Politeness is that a miable disposition, which delights in the happiness of others—consults their ease—prevents their wants—and yields them every possible convenience. This is the source of those civilities and attentions, which distin∣guish a well-bred person—without it, etiquette dwindles into unmeaning cere∣mony.</P>
<P>You perceive then, that not only an attention to external graces, but a regu∣lation
<PB N="292" REF="033601_0284_0FF7A3B878FB1110"/>of the disposition is necessary to constitute a polite person. Acquire the amiable temper I have described, and you will infallibly please with that na∣tive ease which is thought so requisite to be attained, that the world has sub∣stituted in its room its wretched resem∣blance, effrontery:—but no more like the amiable original, than an ordinary statue to the Venus of Medicis.</P>
<P>I have often thought, that the best Christian is likely to be the most polite person. This is an assertion you have not been used to hear, yet may well enough be warranted by the tenor of the gospel precepts, which inculcate the being ten∣der of another's weakness—to prefer each other in honor—to give respect where due—with others to the like purpose. Now if these excellent lessons contain (as I think will be allowed) the substance of what, at this day, is termed good breeding. St. Paul must be a better
<PB N="293" REF="033601_0285_0FF7A3BA344DC540"/>teacher than my lord Chesterfield him∣self, since he breathes the enlivening spirit, without which the ceremonial code is a lifeless system, calculated per∣haps to disguise the heart, but not to add one iota to the real happiness of social life.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more talked of than religion—nothing less understood—with∣out comprehending what it really is, the spirit of bigotry would arrogate the whole, nor allow of its being without the contra∣cted pale of a particular sect.</P>
<P>I have juster notions of religion—see it as it is—not a mode of ceremonies, but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct; its simple, fixed and de∣terminate sense, is briefly love of God, and good will to mankind. This, dear girls, is the sum of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewish church—vain are the ceremonials of the Christian.</P>
<P>The "love of God," is an expression that, of late years, has been as grossly abu∣sed as the word religion. Strange as it may
<PB N="295" REF="033601_0287_0FF77EB8FB519BA0"/>appear, there have been those, who lead∣ing the most immoral lives, have stiled themselves the lovers of the God of puri∣ty—whose tongues could utter a pious eja∣culation, while their hands were com∣mitting the most flagitious crimes. But be not deceived—this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthusi∣asm. The love of God is not a passion, but a rational principle; it is those senti∣ments of reverence and gratitude, which naturally arise in a generous mind when reflecting on one supreme beneficent pow∣er, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all perfection. This conviction is the parent of unaffect∣ed piety; the soul cannot but adore the Being she believes to be all-wise, almigh∣ty, and eternal;—she cannot but love him who is the source of unnumbered blessings; nor chuse, but dread to offend him whose nature she believes to be holi∣ness. Hence the source of moral virtue—sin is avoided, because displeasing to the
<PB N="296" REF="033601_0288_0FF7A3C1F58969F0"/>will of the Deity; and virtuous disposi∣tions are acquired, because agreeable to a Power who is able to reward every endea∣vour to please him, with eternal and un∣speakable happiness.</P>
<P>Such a filial, rational love, must be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the being and attributes of God;—or that has not received from bigotry or su∣perstition, any mistaken notions of him. To prevent being disturbed by the spiri∣tual pride of hypocritical fanatics, remem∣ber there is an invariable test by which you may know if you have the love of God. Ask your own heart, if it seeks the favour of the Deity above every other consideration? If it values this more than its dearest interests, and even life itself, a ready affirmative puts the question out of all doubt.</P>
<P>Be assured, my dear girls, that nothing so highly elevates and adorns
<PB N="297" REF="033601_0289_0FF7A3C389A2CC00"/>the human character, as a steady ration∣al piety—nor is any thing capable of yielding so pure and exalted a happiness to the soul, as an habit of devotion. No one who has experienced the vicissitude of sublunary things, but must highly value the privilege of possessing a friend, that would at all times be acceptable—ready to hear the complaints of affliction, and all powerful to relieve them.</P>
<P>Such a friend you may enjoy in the Divine Being; of what consequence is it then that you acquire a taste for the exercises of devotion; that you cultivate a friendship with heaven, and accustom your hearts to talk with God. This is an emphatical expression of David, and gives you an idea of rational and sincere prayer—which consists not in formal addresses, but is the genuine language of the heart. Such a divine intimacy has something in it extremely suitable to the noblest sensations of the soul; and
<PB N="298" REF="033601_0290_0FF7A3C5F65A0448"/>therefore may well be sought after as a source of refined and exquisite felicity. In trouble, you will find it more precious than the balm of Gilead—it will shed a ray of sacred peace when the dark clouds of adversity obscure your path—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> death. But here my pen must stop—there can be no doubt but at that final, that awful period, the divine attachment breaks forth into a seraphic flame.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE generality of people style them∣selves Christians, without understanding the value or the necessity of christianity; and perhaps neither the one nor the other can be seen in a proper light, without taking a comparative view of the human soul before and after the fall.</P>
<P>It is not for my humble pen to illustrate the excellency of a system which has God himself for its author—nor is it my design to attempt a task so far above my abilities: yet that you may not wholly take your re∣ligion upon trust, I would call your atten∣tion to what man was when first created.</P>
<P>But a little inferior to angels, his reason was clear, his soul all purity, and his mind all intelligence—fit companion for natures wholly spiritual, and enjoying the most familiar intercourse with them. That
<PB N="300" REF="033601_0292_0FF7A3CB1F820A40"/>grand question which has since agitated the schools of philosophy, of what was the chief good of man, was all apparent to the first of the human race: he saw perfectly clear, that it consisted in the entire assimi∣lation of his will to that of the Deity—and in the pursuit found a full unmixed felici∣ty. But he was created with the power of doing otherwise, or where would have been the merit of obedience? The duty of free agency, must be far preferable to that which arises from blind necessity.</P>
<P>Adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained consonant to that of his Maker; but at the instant it deviated therefrom, he fell from happiness and per∣fection. The conciseness of the scripture history, leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of Adam's transgression, but undoubtedly it originated in the mere desire of doing contrary to the divine com∣mand;—he forgot that the Diety was his happiness, and he sought it in his own will.
<PB N="301" REF="033601_0293_0FF7A3CCABE51750"/>It was herein he sinned, and not simply by eating the forbidden fruit, for at the very moment Adam became capable of imagining there might be a good abstract from the favour of God—that moment he fell.</P>
<P>The Creator saw at one comprehensive view, the miseries which would accrue to mankind, from the voluntary perversion of the intellectual and moral powers;— then was the scheme of Christianity devis∣ed, as an effectual means of restoring hu∣man nature to the happiness and perfection it originally possessed. The purposed blessing was graciously announced in that prediction, that the posterity of Eve should crush the serpent's head.</P>
<P>The human reason thus clouded, it is almost surprising to reflect by what rapid steps the world became immersed in the worst ignorance and vice. Those who still retained some idea of the Sovereign Crea∣tor,
<PB N="302" REF="033601_0294_0FF7A468B9A47070"/>had recourse to a visible symbol of his Majesty; for their intellectual faculties were too gross to apprehend an immateri∣al Deity—it soon happened that the sym∣bol itself was made the object of divine worship; and hence, doubtless, the origin of idolatry, which in the time of Abraham had so generally spread over the earth, that it appeared necessary to the Supreme Governor of the Universe to call that good man from his country and his kindred to ordain him the father of a nation; who being, by numerous and peculiar laws, se∣parated from the rest of the would, might preserve, uncorrupt, the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only these laws, but the frequent and signal manifestations of Almighty power were to secure that people from the grossest idolatry, the rights of which were now become so terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in sacrifices to their horrid idols. What a picture is here of human
<PB N="303" REF="033601_0295_0FF77ECDA82F6250"/>nature! that nature which once so nearly approached the angelic! Do you not be∣gin to see the necessity of a Redeemer? Let us pursue the thread of history, and take a superficial view of the most cele∣brated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance.</P>
<P>The Egyptians were very early esteem∣ed for learning, laws and arts—they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but so grossly idolatrous, that they not on∣ly worshipped images, but beasts, insects, and even vegetables. The manufactures and extensive commerce of Phoenicia, sup∣pose some advance in refinement—but national intercourse in those wretched times served but to promulgate national idolatries. Babylon, that mighty seat of empire surpassed most other nations in the superb materials of her Gods. Astrono∣mers there observed the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the splendid hosts that adorned them. Cyrus,
<PB N="304" REF="033601_0296_0FF77ECF37BD64D8"/>who erected the Persian on the ruins of the Babylonish Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being who named him, an age before he had existence, as the in∣strument of Liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn subverted this extensive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Persian—for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the inconsiderable land of Jukea, where only a few despised, enfeebled tribes, possessed the light of sa∣cred knowledge.</P>
<P>What a spectacle for the Father of the universe! who produced a world to know him and be happy! how much must his divine compassion be excited, on contem∣plating his glorious work in ruins!—to redeem it was an effort worthy of himself.</P>
<P>We now come to the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome—a period when I fancy I see the human soul like a brilliant
<PB N="305" REF="033601_0297_0FF77ED183CD30B8"/>gem, illustrious in the dust. What noble struggles did then the human reason make to free itself from the incumbent load or darkness and error! Then lived those nu∣merous worthies, whose names are yet precious to posterity. What greatness of soul—what a taste for solid glory—what elevated sentiments did they not disco∣ver? Yet these men, so far superior to the rest of their species, acknowledged a mul∣tiplicity of deities, whose moral charac∣ters were infinitely inferior to their own, and to whom they scrupled not to ascribe actions which themselves would have blush∣ed to acknowledge. Every passion of the human mind was personified, and deified; statues graced every corner of their streets. Yet were there not wanting some among them who made bold advances in search of better informatiòn—like benighted tra∣vellers, they followed the most distant gleam of light, yet all they could obtain was doubt and obscurity.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="033601_0298_0FF77EEC236343E0"/>
At this period, when reason had done all it could do to regain its native rights and privileges—the Saviour of the world appeared, at whose sacred presence idola∣try fled, and the knowledge of the one true God began to enlighten mankind. They were no longer compelled to en∣quire, "Where is God our maker?" They knew him, and were instructed in his di∣vine worship. The doctrines which the divine Messiah taught, eminently tended to restore human nature to the rectitude and happiness it had lost—they were calcula∣ted to harmonize the passions, regulate the affections, and exalt the soul to a sense of her own dignity, by revealing in the clear∣est terms, the immortality of her nature—a point which philosophy had long sought to explore through the dim veil of pro∣bable conjecture.</P>
<P>A cursory view of the tenets of Christi∣anity is sufficient to evince, that they are designed to establish the happiness of man∣kind
<PB N="307" REF="033601_0299_0FF7A3CE5B7DEB08"/>even in the present life. Consider the benevolence and charity they incul∣cate—the patience, meekness, moderation, contempt of worldly pleasures and enjoy∣ments, the generous clemency to ene∣mies; with the rest of that bright assem∣blage of virtues they enjoin, and you will confess it a matter of wonder that the felicity of Eden is not already restored to those countries where the religion of Christ is professed—and the reason it is not so can be none other, than that of the thou∣sands who daily make profession of it, so few have a competent knowledge of its na∣ture and design. Born in a Christian land, they think such a scrutiny superfluous. Thus they call themselves Christians, with∣out having any thing of the spirit of Christ. —And thus the human race is still ob∣noxious to a thousand miseries, for want of applying to themselves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="033601_0300_0FF7A3D2D6157140"/>
May you, my dear girls, be effectually convinced of the inestimable value of this divine dispensation, and think with Dr. Young, that
<Q>"A Christian is the highest style of man."</Q></P>
<P>There are no virtuous dispositions—no generous affections—no truly noble sentiments, that are not comprised in that sublime character. Possess it, my young friends, for no higher distinction, or grea∣ter felicity, can possibly be wished you by CORNELIA.</P>
