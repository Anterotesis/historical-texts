<P><HI>WHEREAS a Dialogue between a Father and Son, printed some time ago, met with a speedy sale, and was thought of some advantage, 'tis now thought that a con∣tinuation of said Dialogue, may be still more advantage∣ous, and it is committed to the press for that purpose.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEAR Son, you re∣member that some considerable time ago, we took a rambling walk through the or∣chards, fields and meadows, and close by the side of the river, where we took a view of the bridges, mills and falls, and proceeded down the stream until it emptied itself in∣to the ocean, where the great ships traverse the main, and go round the world, which is above twenty thousand miles, or as the ships must sail, to go round the
<PB N="6" REF="048411_0004_1025347C888BF148"/>different capes of land, it will be above forty thousand miles, before they can get back to the place from whence they sat out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I very well remember that agreeable walk, and should be glad to take another such, if you would go with me.—But I never could understand how the ships could go round the world, when there is so much land as well as wa∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear son, it is not strange that you should not fully understand it, for there are many men that cannot fully comprehend it. But when you are older and have read some books on geogra∣phy, and had an opportunity also to see a terrestial globe, where the globe is divided into land and wat∣er, and where the tract of Lord
<PB N="7" REF="048411_0005_102534818D0D8D80"/>Arson and Capt. Cook, is marked out on the globe, you may easily conceive how they may go round the world, and return again to the place from which they sat out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly sir, I think it would be a very pleasing study, and I hope that I shall soon be ready to begin it, for I should be greatly pleased to see how the globe is di∣vided into land and water, and to see where the different nations of the world live, and whether they be black or white, heathen or christian, and what is the produce and manufacture of the different parts of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis truly a very agree∣ble study, and at a proper time I shall be glad to instruct you therein, but at present we will de∣fer it, and talk of something else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="048411_0006_102534859C833990"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well sir I am willing to be directed by you, as you know what will be most useful and bene∣ficial to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since the time that we took that agreeable walk, you are become older and bigger, and I hope have read and learned a good deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir I have read some little story books wrote for the instruc∣tion of children, such as the Moth∣er's gift, the Father's legacy to his children, the Child's Instruc∣tor, and Children's Friend, &amp;c. I have also read some little histories of the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not also read the bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, I have read it through and through again, and some parts of it I have read many times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="048411_0007_10253489E6A2B388"/>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I hope you re∣member a good deal that you have read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope that I remember some, but truly my memory is so poor, that I do not remember half so much as I wish I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you remem∣ber to have read in the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember that in the beginning God created the world, the heavens and the earth, the sun, moon and stars, and the sea, and all in the space of six days, and res∣ted from his labour on the seventh, which was the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not also re∣member that God made man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember that it is said, that God made man out of the dust of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="048411_0008_1025348D29080B28"/>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>After God had made man where did he live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that he was pla∣ced in the garden of Eden, which is also called the garden of Para∣dise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was he to live there alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we read that God said it was not good that man should be alone, and he caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he took out one of his ribs, of which he made a woman, and brought her to Adam to see what he would call her, and he called her Eve, for she was bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, and she became his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>What were they to be employed about in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that they were to cultivate and till the ground,
<PB N="11" REF="048411_0009_10253492840B2BE8"/>and take care of the fruit trees, herbs, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had they liberty to eat of all the fruit trees in the gar∣den.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that they had liberty to eat of all except one, which was the tree of knowledge and of good and evil, which they were not to eat of, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as to eat of that tree, which God had commanded them that they should not eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sir, we read that the serpent (or the devil) said unto the woman, that she should not surely die if she eat of that true, but that they should be as Gods, to know good and evil, and to she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the temptation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the fruit and did eat, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="12" REF="048411_0010_102534955258AF90"/>unto her husband and he did eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was the consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we read that their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and had sin∣ed, and they endeavoured to hide themselves from the presence of God, among the trees of the gar∣den.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did God after this suf∣fer them to continue in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we read that God turned them out of the garden, and placed a flaming sword to prevent their return, and God cursed the earth in consequence of their sin∣ing, and said, that it should bring forth briars and thorns, and that men should earn their bread with the sweat of their brows, until they should again return to the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had Adam and Eve any children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="048411_0011_10253496D80E0CF0"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they had Cain and Abel, of whom we read that Cain was a wicked boy, and Abel a good boy, and when they were grown up Cain was angry with his brother Abel, and when they were in the field, he rose up against him and slew him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was not God angry with Cain for killing his brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is said, that God was very angry with him, and told him that he should be a vagabond up∣on the earth, and that every one who sound him should slay him; and Cain said, that his punish∣ment was greater than he could bear, and God set a mark upon him, least any finding him should slay him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did mankind multi∣ply upon the earth after this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="048411_0012_1025349B13359270"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they multiplied and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very numerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the people gener∣ally good and virtuous, or very sin∣ful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read in the bible that mankind became very sinful, and by their sins and wickedness, pro∣voked God to anger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was the consequence of the world becom∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that the great God was very angry with them, and threatened to crown the world, and destroy mankind, unless they repeated and became good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not mankind in general grow better and repent after God and so threatened them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we read that they still continued wicked, except Noah and his family, and God bid No∣ah
<PB N="15" REF="048411_0013_102534A1A1C39DA0"/>build an Ark, by which he and his family and some of all sorts of creatures, might be preserved and saved alive, when the rest of the world should be drowned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long was No∣ah in building the Ark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that he was ma∣ny years in building it, for it was a very great building, with many a∣partments; it was three stories high, and made to accommodate all that was to be taken into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not Noah called a preacher of righteousness to the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is so called in the Bible, and I suppose he preach∣ed to the people, and warned them to repent and become good, or they would all be destroyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the peo∣ple regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and attend to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="048411_0014_102534A329EFC760"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they went on in their old way until the fatal day in which the rain began to fall, and Noah &amp; his family, and two and two of all creatures went into the Ark, and the doors and windows were closed, and no man suffered to go in, and so they were all drowned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long did the flood prevail on the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that it rained forty days and forty nights, and the fountain of the great deep was broken up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did Noah know when the waters were abated on the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days, but after 40 days Noah opened a window and let out a dove, who after flying about and finding no place to rest her feet upon, she re∣turned
<PB N="17" REF="048411_0015_102534F15426B8D0"/>to Noah and he took her again into the Art; and then he waited seven days more, and let her go out again, and after a while she returned with an olive leaf in her mouth plucked off, by which Noah supposed the waters were a∣bated, and after seven days more be let out the dove again and she never returned, and after a while the Ark rested on a great mountain called Ararat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long was this flood upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that in the sixth hundred and first year of Noah, the first month and first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the face of the earth, and No∣ah and his family, and all the crea∣tures in the Ark went out upon the dry land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>What now become of Noah and his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="048411_0016_102534F6DA957F08"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that God made a covenant with him, and it was confirmed by a rainbow, that the earth should not again be drowned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>After the flood, was the posterity of Noah all good, or did the people again be wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read that they again become very wicked, and thought in their pride to build a great tow∣er, that should reach up to heaven, and God was angry, and came down and destroyed their language, so that they could not understand each other, and so they were scat∣tered upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>But was there no good people in all this time, did not God make some discovery of Christ the Saviour, who was to come in∣to the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we read that soon after the fall of man, God said, that
<PB N="19" REF="048411_0017_102534AA8AE34AE0"/>the seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head; but I never knew the true meaning of that sentence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the meaning of that text is generally supposed to be, that a Saviour, the <HI>Messiah,</HI> should come into this world, and make satisfaction for the sins of man, and so destroy the works of Satan, and thereby prepare the way for man to be finally saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there any further prophecy of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who was to come into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there were many prophecies and intimations thereof, to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Ja∣cob, to David, Isaiah, and other Prophets of old, and all the sacri∣fices of beasts and birds, &amp;c. that we read of in the old testament, are supposed to look forward to that
<PB N="20" REF="048411_0018_102534ACE3FED800"/>great and atoneing sacrifice that should be made for sin, by Jesus Christ the Messiah, and Saviour of the world; and especially by the type of the <HI>brazen Serpent,</HI> that was erected in the wilderness, which the children of Israel were directed to look to, when they had been bit∣ten by the flying fiery serpents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did the Messiah tru∣ly come into the world, agreeable to the prophecy and expectation of the people, who were looking and waiting for the accomplishment of these prophecies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in the fulness of time, namely, at about the four thousandth year of the world, the Messiah made his appearance to the Jews and the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not the Jews, (God's ancient people,) expect him as a temporal king, and that he
<PB N="21" REF="048411_0019_102534B102666528"/>would be ushered into the world in great pomp and splendor, and that he would deliver them from their bondage to the Romans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly this was their expectations, and they were greatly disappointed when they found that he rather took on him the form of a servant, and was poor and despised in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where was Christ's first appearance in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was born at Beth∣lehem, and was found with his mother Mary in a stable, there be∣ing no room for them in the inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there any intimation to any body, of the Messiah being born into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the shepherds were seeding their flocks, an angel appeared unto them and told them that the Messiah who had been
<PB N="22" REF="048411_0020_102534B40FD0A908"/>long expected, was born into the world; and the shepherds were dis∣posed to go and see him, and pay their worship and adoration unto him, and also the wise men of the East, enquired where Christ should be born, and they were directed by the appearance of a star in the Heavens, that went before them, and stood over the place where the child Jesus was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did they find as the Angel had told them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they found the child Jesus and his mother Mary at Bethlehem, laying in a manger, and they rejoiced and praised God that there was a Saviour born into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not King Herod de∣sire the wise men when they retur∣ned, to tell him where they found him, that he might also go and worship him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="048411_0021_102534B9B77864C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he did, but his design was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was afraid that he would become a king and take away his kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did the wise men of the East, return and inform the King Herod.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they returned a∣nother way and to disappointed him, and he was so angry that he ordered all the children from two years old and under to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but Mary with her child Jesus, went into Egypt, and so escaped his hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there any thing ex∣traordinary that appeared in Christ Jesus whilst he was young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read in the Bible, that he kept with his parents, and was subject to them;—but when he was twelve years old he was found in the temple, asking ques∣tions
<PB N="24" REF="048411_0022_102534BF19BD85F8"/>of the doctors, and giving answers beyond what could be ex∣pected from one of his age; and he asked his parents if they did not know that he must be about his father's business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is said of him when he became a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>He became a preach∣er, and speak as never man spake before; and he went about doing good, healing the sick, restoring the lame, giving sight to the blind; he fed many thousands with a few loaves and fishes, and raised some to life again who had been dead, and did many miracles, so that thousands flocked after him to be healed of their diseases of soul and body, and they brought little chil∣dren to him, and his disciples for∣bad them, but he told them to come, for of such he said was the
<PB N="25" REF="048411_0023_102534C0A3F2C628"/>kingdom of God, and he took them up in his arms and blessed them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What doctrine did he preach, or what advice did he give to the people that came to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told them that they were sinners, and that they must repent of their sins, and be∣lieve on Jesus Christ if they would be saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is meant by repen∣tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have learned your Catechism, which tells you what repentance is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it is said, <Q>Repentance unto life is a saving grace, whereby a sinner out of a true sense of his sin, and appre∣hension of the mercy of God, in Jesus Christ, doth with grief and hatred thereof, turn from it
<PB N="26" REF="048411_0024_102534C899CC7248"/>unto God, with full purpose and endeavours after new obedience.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you also remem∣ber the answer to the question, "What is faith in Jesus Christ?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the answer says, <Q>That saith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we re∣ceive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered in the gospel.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is this all that we are to do, in order to be saved and go to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I believe that those who repent and believe on Christ, will not fail of being saved and going to Heaven; but they who have true faith and repentance will be disposed to good works, and to hate every wicked and false way, to do as they would be done by, and attend unto all the rules
<PB N="27" REF="048411_0025_102534D19EDBDB48"/>and precepts of the gospel, to fear God and keep his command, and live soberly, rationally, and Godly, in this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not of free grace that any are saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely it is, and who∣soever is saved will be ready to acknowledge, that it is all grace from the foundation to the top stone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I am obliged to you, for the good instruction given me, and I can say as King Agrippa said to Paul, thou almost persuad∣est me to be a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I can as truly say as St. Paul, I wish that you was not only almost but altogether per∣suaded to be a Christian, that so after serving God, and your gener∣ation according to his will, you might go to Heaven and be eter∣nally blessed and happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="048411_0026_102534D464717F90"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it worth while for children and young solks to be religious, and to put on the Chris∣tian name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely it is well worth while, and it highly becomes all, both young and old, to profess and practice the Christian.—Hear what the great poet, and good man, Dr. Young, says;—
<Q><L>"A Christian is the highest stile of man,</L>
<L>"And is there who the blessed cross wipes off</L>
<L>"As a foul blot from his dishon∣our'd brow?</L>
<L>"If angels tremble, 'tis at such a sight:</L>
<L>"The wretch they quit, desponding of their charge,</L>
<L>"More struck with grief, or won∣der, who can tell?"</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your in∣struction
<PB N="29" REF="048411_0027_102534D6039E8F38"/>and kind advice, and hope I may have wisdom and grace to follow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Dear Son, if you do truly so <HI>hope,</HI> you will be willing <HI>from your heart</HI> to join in the fol∣lowing PRAYER.</P>
<P><HI>Oh Lord God, have mercy on me in Jesus Christ thy dear Son; and for his sake pardon all my sins, and accept of me</HI> (a poor sinful child,) <HI>as righteous in thy sight. Make me a Christian indeed, and help me to live a sober and religious life, that my latter end may be that of the righteous, and my eternity happy.— AMEN.</HI></P>

<P>THE bitterest things in reli∣gion are sweet; there is a sweetness even in reproofs; when God meets with our corruptions, and whispers unto us, such and such things are dangerous; and that if we cherish them, they will bring us to hell, the word of God is sweet to a christian, that hath his heart under his innocence; is not pardon sweet to a condemand man, and riches sweet to a poor man, and favor sweet to a man in disgrace, and liberty sweet to a man in captivity? so all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<HEAD>ORIGIN OF SHIPPING.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>And God said to Noah, make thee an ark of Gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within, and without, with pitch.</HI></Q>
<P>THE most ingenious and use∣ful arts are of celestial origin; and from this chapter it is evident, that the first ship that ever floated on the world of waters, was built ac∣cording to the plan, and under the regulating eye, of a divine artificer. With what amazing contrivance and oeconomy were the directions given by the Deity to Noah? How exact the architecture, and what judicious hints were hence furni∣shed to human creatures in regard
<PB N="34" REF="048411_0031_102534E437397768"/>to maritime affairs! Man has al∣ways been characterised by his powers of imitation. From this very ark arose the first ideas of a possibility to pass beyond the lim∣its of land: the scheme once pro∣jected, and the secret of its con∣struction once imparted, it was not likely to be forgotten; so far otherwise, that we stand indebted to it, for many valuable blessings —for the advantages of commerce, the pleasure of travel, and the glo∣ry of victory. The merchant and the sailor owe to this undertaking all their benefits; and whatever de∣sirable circumstances arise from connections with remote climates, certainly originate from an imita∣tion of that sacred repository, which preserved from the deluge the fam∣ily of Noah.</P>

<HEAD>OF COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>BE very circumspect in the choice of your company; in the society of your equals you may en∣joy pleasure; in the society of your superiors, you may find pro∣fit; but to be the best in compa∣ny, is to be in the way of grow∣ing worse; the best means to im∣prove, is, to be the least there. But above all, be the companion of those who fear the Lord, and keep his precepts.</P>

<HEAD>OF POVERTY.</HEAD>
<P>IN seeking virtue, if you find poverty, be not ashamed, the fault is not yours. Your honour or dishonour is purchased by your own actions; though virtue gives a ragged livery, she gives a gold∣en
<PB N="36" REF="048411_0033_102534EB3AA467C8"/>cognizance. If her service make you poor, blush not; your poverty may prove disadvantage∣ous to you, but cannot dishonour you.</P>

<HEAD>OF READING.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the diversions of life, there is none so proper to fill up its empty spaces, as the reading of useful and entertaining authors; and with that the conversation of a well chosen friend. By reading we enjoy the dead, by conversa∣tion the living, and by contempla∣tion ourselves. Reading enriches the memory, conversation polishes the wit, and contemplation im∣proves the judgment. Of these reading is the most important, which furnishes both the others.</P>
