<P>The following piece was drawn up at the re∣quest of some gentlemen who are interested in the purchases of land on the Mississippi and Donbigby, lately made from the state of Geor∣gia. It was their object to obtain, not merely a legal opinion, but such a statement and exami∣nation of the subject, as might enable persons inclined to enquire into it, to understand the case, and judge for themselves. With this view it is now presented to the public by their direction. Whatever may be thought of the authors con∣clusions, it is hoped that his statement and re∣ferences will be found of some use.</P>

<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE GEORGIA SALES ON THE MISSISSIPPI CONSIDERED &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Opinion of counsel is required on the following points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether any claims of the United States can affect the purchases of land made from the state of Georgia in 1795, by the Upper Missisippi and Georgia Companies or either of them?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether those purchases can be affected by the Act of the Georgia legislature passed Febru∣ary 3, 1796, and commonly called the Repeal∣ing Act?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In answering the first of these questions it will be proper to consider the claims of the United States under two points of view; first as they re∣spect the state of Georgia itself; and secondly, as they respect the purchasers under the state. For, though in general, purchasers stand, as to all legal intents, in the same situation with the seller, there may be particular circumstances which will create a wide difference between them. It will be proper to enquire whether these lands or any part of them belonged to the United States at the time of the
<PB N="2" REF="035588_0004_1005F742584C2760"/>sale? and, in that case, whether it was attended or preceded by any conduct on their part, which will render it valid against them in the eye of the law?</P>
<P>In discussing the question "Whether any part of these lands belonged to the United States at the time of the sale" we must carry back our at∣tention to the first discovery of North-America, and take a review of the various public acts by which the rights of soil and jurisdiction, to that part of it where the lands in question lie, have been affected from that period to the present time. Such other transactions as it may be necessary to recur to in other parts of the investigation, though they have no immediate relation to this point, will, for the sake of perspicuity, be noticed in the order in which they occurred.</P>
<P>It was a principle admitted by all the European nations in the establishment and regulation of their American colonies, that prior discovery, accom∣panied by actual occupation, and, in some cases, without it, vested the right of soil and jurisdiction. Spain thus acquired her extensive dominions in South-America; and by the same side she laid claim to Florida in the southern parts of the North-American continent. England, also, by virtue of discoveries made under her flag in the reign of Henry VII. claimed the whole extent of North-America from Florida to Hudson's bay. The boundary between her discoveries and Florida re∣mained for a long time uncertain, and was fre∣quently the subject of dispute between the two crowns. She claimed, however, as far south as the latitude twenty-nine; and Spain at length ce∣ded Florida to her, which put an end to the con∣tention.</P>
<P>England made settlements, at a very early pe∣riod, in the northern and middle parts of this ex∣tensive
<PB N="3" REF="035588_0005_1005F744F3A75F98"/>region, and erected governments which now compose the states from Virginia to New-Hampshire, inclusive. These governments were of two kinds, royal and proprietary. In the former the right of soil and jurisdiction remained in the crown; and their boundaries, though described by its letters patent, were subject to alteration at its pleasure: for, as it possessed the rights of soil and government, and delegated them to its gover∣nors, during pleasure, it might dispose of them in what manner and to whom it thought fit, might al∣ter, extend, or abridge the delegation as its incli∣nation or policy might dictate. In the latter, the proprietary governments, the right of soil as well jurisdiction was vested in the proprietors. Their charters were in the nature of grants, and their li∣mits being fixed by these charters could not be al∣tered but by their own consent. This distinction is particularly noticed here, because in the pro∣gress of the discussion it will appear to be of very great importance.</P>
<P>Most of the governments were at first proprie∣tary; but, in progress of time, the greater part of them, either by the forfeiture or surrender of the charters, became royal.</P>
<P>The first of these charters, under which any set∣tlement took place, was given by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh in the year 1584<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazard's collection, 33.</NOTE>. Like the previous charters from her and Henry VII. to Cabot, Sir Humphrey Gilbert and others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 9, 11, 24.</NOTE>, it was merely a commission to discover any countries not occupied by Christian people, to take possession of them, and form settlements under the allegiance of the crown of England. It also prohibited any other persons from settling within two hundred
<PB N="4" REF="035588_0006_1005F7468572E9A8"/>miles of any place where he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, "within six years." Under this charter he made two settlements: one south of the Chesa∣peake, composed of about one hundred persons, who arrived in June 1585, and returned to Eng∣land in the June following: the other near the mouth of James' river, and consisting of about the same number of settlers, who arrived in the year 1587, and continued there. In the title of the charter it is said that it shall continue in force for six years, and no more; but in the body of it there is no limitation. In the year 1603<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State trials, vol. i. p. 186.</NOTE>, how∣ever, it was forfeited by the attainder of sir Wal∣ter Raleigh, for treason, and the right re-vested in the crown.</P>
<P>In the year 1606, James I. by his letters pa∣tent dated April 10<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hazards col. 50.</NOTE>, gave permission to two com∣panies to form settlements on any part of the coast of North-America, between latitudes 34 and 45. These companies were denominated the first and second colonies of Virginia: The first was to make its settlements between 34 and 41 degrees of lati∣tude, the second between 38 and 45. Neither was to settle within two hundred miles of any place previously settled by the other. Each was to possess all the lands along the coast fifty miles in both directions from the place of its first settle∣ment, one hundred miles back into the country, and all the islands within one hundred miles of the coast. A council was appointed for the go∣vernment of each colony, and it was provided that all the lands contained within the above mention∣ed limits should, on petition to the crown, be grant∣ed to such persons as the respective councils should recommend.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035588_0007_1005F748ED9B6E28"/>
It does not appear that any such grants were ever made; but James I. by letters patent, dated May 23, 1609<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazardss col. 58.</NOTE>, separated the first colony from the second, and, on the petition of the persons composing it, erected them and a number of o∣thers into a corporation under the name of "The treasurer and a company of adventurers and plan∣ters of the city of London, for the first colony of Virginia." All the lands along the coast, two hundred miles south, and an equal distance north, of point Comfort, and extending west to the South-Sea, with the islands within one Hundred miles of the coast, were granted to this company, commonly called the London company, and their successors, in fee simple; in trust however, to be distributed among settlers: and the powers of go∣vernment were vested in two councils, one in Eng∣land, and one in America.</P>
<P>Point Comfort being about latitude 36, 30, the limits of this charter must have extended south to about latitude 33. It is not easy to determine whether the government erected by it ought to be considered as royal or proprietary; but it has more the appearance of the former.</P>
<P>On the 12, of March 1612<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 72.</NOTE>, James I. granted another charter to the London company, which confirms the former, and adds to their territories all the islands within 300 leagues of the lands for∣merly granted to them, and between the 30, and 41, degrees of latitude.</P>
<P>The company continued to exercise the powers of government, and dispose of the rights of soil, within the limits allotted to them, till about the year 1624, when the affairs of the colony appear∣ing to be badly conducted, their charters were
<PB N="6" REF="035588_0008_1005F74B7A0973D0"/>forfeited by quo warranto<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazard's col. 83.89.</NOTE>, and the government with all the rights of soil and jurisdiction taken into the hands of the crown. By this resumption Virginia became, if it were not so before, a royal government; and its boundaries became liable to abridgment or alteration of the pleasure of the monarch.</P>
<P>The rights of soil and jurisdiction in all the lands south of the Chesapeake, not actually appropri∣ated being thus re-vested in the crown, king Charles I. made a grant to sir Robert Heath, his attorney general, extending from the 30, to the 36, degree of latitude north<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. report, 28.</NOTE>. This grant was ever afterwards considered as void, but whether by surrender, nor user, or in what other manner, does not appear.</P>
<P>The next grant of this country was by Charles II. to lord Clarendon and others bearing date March 24, 1662. It included "all that territo∣ry or tract of ground situate, lying and being, within his said majesty's dominions in America, extending from the north end of the island called Lucker island, which lyeth in the northern Vir∣ginia seas, and within six and thirty degrees of the northern latitude, and to the west as far as the South-Seas, and so southerly as far as the river St. Matthias which bordereth upon the coast of Flo∣rida, and within one-and-thirty degrees of nor∣thern latitude, and so within a direct line as far as the South-Seas aforesaid." These grantees were afterwards called "Lords Proprietors," and the country contained within their boundaries was erected by the charter into a province, under the name of "Carolina." Extensive immunities were conferred on settlers, and the rights of soil and
<PB N="7" REF="035588_0009_1005F74EF152F400"/>government, were vested in the proprietors in fee simple.</P>
<P>By another charter from Charles II. bearing date June 30, 1664, the former was confirmed, and its limits extended from latitude 36, 30 to latitude 29 inclusive, and from those points due west to the South-Sea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. report, 47.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 25, of July 1726, the lords proprietors by deed duly executed, surrendered to the crown all their rights under these charters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 44.72.</NOTE>, lord Carteret alone one of the number, retained his share, and it was afterwards separately alloted to him in the northern parts of the province. The surrender was accepted and confirmed by act of parliament, and by virtue of it Carolina became a royal go∣vernment. It was afterwards divided into two provinces, called North and South-Carolina, by a line beginning at the north end of long Bay, and running thence north-west to the latitude 35, and thence due west to the South-Sea; lord Carteret, better known by the name of lord Granville, had his part laid off in North-Carolina</P>
<P>George II. by letters patent bearing date on the 9, of June 1732<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 91.97.</NOTE>, erected lord Dereival James Og∣lethorpe and others, into a corporation under the title of the <Q>Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America,</Q> and granted to them and their successors, in trust for future settlers, all those lands countries and territories, situate, lying and being, in that part of South-Carolina in Ame∣rica, which lies from the northern stream of a ri∣ver, there commonly called the Savannah, all along the sea coast to the southward unto the most southern stream of a certain other great water or river called the Alatamaha, and westward from
<PB N="8" REF="035588_0010_1005F75173AE5CA8"/>the heads of the said river, respecttively, in direct lines to the South Seas. This country was erect∣ed into a province called "Georgia," and power was given to the trustees for twenty-one years to frame laws and regulations for its government; after which all the rights of soil and jurisdiction were to vest in the crown.</P>
<P>Under this charter Oglethorpe took possession of the country for the trustees and made several settlements: and in the year 1752, the trustees by deed duly executed, surrendered their charter to the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att gen. report, 97.</NOTE>, Georgia therefrom bcame a royal government.</P>
<P>By the treaty of Paris in 1763, Spain ceded to Great-Britain, Florida, Pensacola, and, in general, all that she held in North-America east and south∣east of the river Mississippi: and a line drawn down that river from its source to the séa, was establish∣ed as the western boundary of the British domi∣nions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See an extract from the treaty, appendix, No. 1</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after this cession the British government, by a proclamation for the regulation of its colo∣nies being dated October 7, 1763, errcted Florida into two governments called East and West Florida. They were divided from each other by the Ape∣latchicola river; and the latter was bounded by the gulph of Mexico on the south, on the west by lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas, and the river Mississippi, and on the north by a line drawn from that part of the river Mississippi which is intersect∣ed by latitude 31, due east to the Apilachicola. The northern boundary of East Florida was a line drawn from the confluence of the Chatahocchee and Flint rivers, where they form the Apilachi∣cola,
<PB N="9" REF="035588_0011_1005F753064F5370"/>to the head of the St. Mary's, and down it to the sea.</P>
<P>Disputes in the mean time having arisen be∣tween the governments of South-Carolina and Georgia, about the lands, lying between the Ala∣tamoha and St. Mary's, they were, by this pro∣clamation, annexed to Georgia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the proclamation, Appendix, No. 2.</NOTE>, whose southern boundary, stretching only to the Alatamoha by its original charter, was thus extended to the ri∣ver St. Mary's.</P>
<P>The proclamation also contains a clause, "Re∣serving under the sovereignty, protection and domi∣nion of the crown, for the use of the Indians, all the land and territories not included within the li∣mits of the governments thereby erected, or with∣in the limits of the territory granted to the Hud∣sons Bay company; <HI>as also all the lands and territo∣ries lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west,"</HI> and it forbids "the governors of all the colonies to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents, for any lands beyond the heads of these rivers, till the further pleasure of the crown should be known."</P>
<P>When the first British governor took possession of West Florida he found its limits to the north so contracted as to cut him off from the most fertile and healthy lands, and even to exclude from his province some very considerable settlements, which had been formed under it, and made part of it, while subject to Spanish government. He made a representation of these circumstances to the crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. 3.</NOTE>. It was referred to the board of trade and plantations; and by their advice the province was extended to the north, "By a line drawn from the north of the Yazoo river where it unites
<PB N="10" REF="035588_0012_1005F75678CDCF20"/>with the Mississippi, due east to the Apilachicola." This extension, which took place before the year 1770, was not made by proclamation, but by in∣structions to the governors of that province, and their commissions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 4. An extract from the instructions to governor Ches∣ter. It is not known that any copy of any other of these instructions or com∣missions exist in America. See also Att. gen. report, 21.</NOTE>. They went on to exercise ju∣risdiction and grant lands in the country thus an∣next to their government, till it was ceded to the United States by Great-Britain, at the peace of 1783.</P>
<P>When the British colonies, including South-Carolina and Georgia, dissolved their connection with the mother country in the year 1776, and erected themselves into independent states, they agreed that each should hold by its former limits; that each state should possess the same extent of territory that had belonged to it while a colony. This indeed was not readily contented to: for as the limits of several colonies, as Massachusetts, Connecticut, New-York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia, in∣cluded a great extent of unsettled country, while others, as New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, possessed little or none, the latter contended that these unsettled lands should be considered as a common property among all the states, and appropriated for their mutual benefit; and some of them, particularly Mary∣land, refused to accede to the union, until some of those states which possessed the most extensive limits, should relinquish a part of their claims for this purpose. This was at length done; Massa∣chusetts, Connecticut, New-York, and Virginia, made relinquishments, retaining however very considerable portions of the land in question. The
<PB N="11" REF="035588_0013_1005F758D59A0398"/>articles of confederation were then ratified, leaving all those states which had made no relinquishment in the quiet possession of the whole territory com∣prized within their ancient limits. Of this number was Georgia; which was so far from relinquishing, that on February 7, 1783 she passed an act asserting that her jurisdiction and right of soil extended "over all the country between the Missisippi, the Atlantic, the southern boundary of the United States as established by the treaty of peace, and the Southern boundary of North-Carolina.</P>
<P>By another act passed February 7, 1785 she pro∣ceeded to exercise the rights which she had thus asserted. It was thereby enacted "That all the country contained within a line to be drawn down the Mississippi from where it receives the Yazoo, till it intersects the 31st degree of North latitude, then due east as far as the lands might be found to reach which had at any time been relinquished by the In∣dians, then along the line of relinquishment to the river Yazoo, and down it to its mouth, should be erected into a county called Bourbon, and that when the land-office should be opened, all persons previously settled there should have the right of pre∣emption at one fourth of a dollar per acre."</P>
<P>Under this act, commonly called the Bourbon county act, no settlements were ever made. The relinquishment of land which is spoken of in it took place at Mobile in May 1777, by virtue of a treaty between the Choctaw nation, to whom that country then belonged, and the British superinten∣dant of Indian affairs, and was confirmed by the treaty between those Indians and the United States held at Hopewell on the 3d of January 1786. It extended from the mouth of the Yazoo 110 miles
<PB N="12" REF="035588_0014_1005F75A637D7AD0"/>down the Missisippi; at the upper end it was 15, at the lower 60 miles broad.</P>
<P>About the same time a dispute arose between the states of South-Carolina and Georgia respecting their boundaries. South-Carolina contended that as the original boundaries of Georgia were the ri∣vers Savannah and Alatahama, and lines drawn due west from their sources to the Mississippi, all the land lying south of the Alatamaha and of a line drawn due west from its source to the Missisippi, as far as to the northern boundary of the Floridas, con∣tinued to be a part of the province of South Caro∣lina, out of which Georgia was taken: and that when the British crown, by its proclamation of Oc∣tober 7, 1763, annexed to Georgia, "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatemaha and St. Ma∣ry's" it meant only the lands actually between those rivers below their sources, and not such as lay above those sources, and between lines drawn from them respectively west to the Missisippi; which tracts of country, of course, even after the pro∣clamation, still continued a part of South Carolina. Georgia, on the contrary, maintained that when the proclamation annexed to its governmeet "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's it meant to include not merely the tract of country which lay between those rivers, below their sources, but also the whole territory held by the British crown between the north∣ern boundaries of the Floridas, as established by the same proclamation, and the ancient south∣ern line of Georgia. This dispute was referred to congress under the articles of confederation by a petition from South-Carolina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals of Con. vol. x. p. 190.</NOTE>. A court was ap∣pointed, and a day fixed for a hearing between the two states. But they afterwards agreed to with∣draw
<PB N="13" REF="035588_0015_1005F75D17AFC050"/>the petition and settle the matter by negociation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jour. Con. Vol. xi. p. 218.</NOTE>. Their commissioners met at Beaufort in South-Ca∣rolina for this purpose and on the 24th of April, 1787, agreed on a convention by which that state relinquished the claim. On the 29th of February 1788 this convention was ratified by an act of the legislature. It had previously been laid before con∣gress and filed among the official papers of the U∣nited states<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol xii. p. 130. See also appendix, No. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 21st of December 1789, the legislature of Georgia passed an act for selling all this country from the mouth of Coles creek, which is a little a∣bove the Natches, to latitude 35, and from the Mississippi to the Donbigby. Two companies were to be the purchasers, one called the South-Caroli∣na, the other the Virginia Yazoo company; and they were allowed a pre-emption of two years, on their making the stipulated payments, within which periods they were to receive grants. But a dis∣pute having arisen between them and the state about the mode of payment, the pre-emption expired without payments having actually been made, and no grants were passed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the act—appendix, No. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 7th of December 1793 a representation was presented to the court of Spain on the part of our government, in which the dispute between us and that power respecting boundary was stated, and our claim supported. This representation in∣sists on the latitude 31. as the Southern boundary of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and rests our title to the disputed terri∣tory which lay above that latitude, entirely on the right of that state<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See appendix No 9—an extract from the representation.</NOTE>. Indeed it is of importance to remark here, that in the whole progress of this dispute, which being definitively settled by the late
<PB N="14" REF="035588_0016_1005F760E5C88028"/>treaty between the United States and Spain, need not now be discussed, our government held up the right of the state of Georgia to the territory above latitude 31, as altogether indisputable, and made that right the sole foundation of its own preten∣sions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Se appendix No. 10—An extract from the report of the Secretary of state to the President, which was the basis of the instructions to the commissi∣oners at Madrid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the seventh of January 1795, the legislature of Georgia passed an act for selling parts of the territory on the Mississippi, above latitude 31, to se∣veral companies, one of which was called the Up∣per Mississippi, and another the Georgia company. These are the companies whose rights are the sub∣ject of the present investigation. The land allotted to the first was directed to be bounded by a line "Beginning at the Mississippi river where the northern boundary line of this state (Georgia) strikes the same: thence along the said boundary line due east to the Tenessee river; thence along the said Tenessee river to the mouth of Bear Creek'; thence up Bear Creek, to where the parrallel of latitude twenty-five British statute miles south of the northern boundary aforesaid strikes the same; thence along the said last mentioned parrallel of latitude, across Tombigby or twenty mile creek, due west to the Mississippi river; thence up the middle of the said river to the beginning." The boundaries of the Georgia company were a line, "beginning on the Mobile Bay, where the latitude 31, degrees north of the equator intersects the same, and running up the said Bay to the mouth of the lake Tensaw; thence up the said lake Ten∣saw to the. Alabama river, including currys and all other islands therein; thence up the Alabama to the junction of the Coosa and Danfuskee rivers;
<PB N="15" REF="035588_0017_1005F76336D4E168"/>thence up the Coosa river, above the big shoals, to where it intersects the latitude 34 degrees north of the equator; thence a due west course to the Mississippi river; thence down the middle of the said river, to the latitude 32, 40;" "thence a due east course to the Dunbigby, thence down the middle of the Dunbigby to its junction with the Alabama; thence down the middle of the said river to Mobile Bay; and thence down the Mobile Bay to the place of beginning."</P>
<P>It was provided that the companies should each make a certain deposit of money, on account of the purchase money of the lands, in the treasury of the state; and that on their producing receipts from the treasurer for these deposits, the govern∣or should give them grants, taking at the same time mortgages of the lands to secure the re∣maining payments, which were to be made on or before the first of November following. In case of failure in these payments, the mortgages were to be instantly foreclosed, the first payments to be for∣feited, and the grants to become void. It was also provided "That the lands to be conveyed by vir∣tue of the act should be free from taxation till the inhabitants of them should come to be represent∣ed in the legislature of the state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the act. Appendix No. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The deposits were made accordingly, and the grants passed in pursuance of the act. Before the first of November, the final payments were completed, and the mortgages taken up. The companies afterwards proceeded to sell parts of this land to various per∣sons in New-York, Massachusetts, South-Caroli∣na, and elsewhere, for valuable considerations.</P>
<P>It must be remarked that previous to this act, the various companies had made formal proposals
<PB N="16" REF="035588_0018_1005F764C75551C0"/>to the legislature for the purchase of the lands; which were accepted and a bill passed thro' both houses accordingly. But the governor, judging these terms not sufficiently advantageous to the state, refused his assent to the bill, and stated his objections at large. Another bill was immediately framed so as to obviate the most material of these objections. It was passed, and received his sanc∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 2. clause of the repealing act, which recites these facts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The whole sum of money paid into the treasury of Georgia, on account of these purchases, was five hundred thousand dollars. Of this sum one hundred thousand dollars were appropriated by laws of the state distinct from the abovementioned act, and persuant to those appropriations were ac∣tually expended in the course of the year 1795<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 3. Governor Matthews's communication to the legislature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 13, of February 1796, the repealing act was passed. This act however, makes no mention of repealing that of January 7, 1795, but after stating various objections against it, declares that it was <HI>originally void,</HI> and directs such part of the money paid in under it as then remained in the treasury, to be re-funded to the purchasers, provided they should apply for it in the course of eight months; otherwise to be forfeited to the state, and in the mean time to remain in the trea∣sury at their risk and expence. No provision is made for the reimbursement of that part which had been expended for the use of the state<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 14. The repealing act.</NOTE>. In this situation the affairs now remains.</P>
<P>From this view of the subject it seems sufficient∣ly clear that no part of this country, above a line drawn due east from the mouth of the Yazoo to the Apalachicola, belonged to the United States,
<PB N="17" REF="035588_0019_1005F76750AB97E8"/>at the time of the sale. This it is believed will appear, in a satisfactory manner, from an atten∣tive examination of their claim, under all the points of view in which it seems capable of being presented.</P>
<P>There are but three foundations on which the claims of the United States, in this country can rest.</P>
<P>In the first place it may be contended, that those clauses in the proclamation of 1763, by which the sale and settlement of land in the colo∣nies were restricted to the heads of the rivers fal∣ling into the Atlantic, from the west north-west, did in fact curtail the extent of the colonies, and reduce them from the Mississippi to a line drawn from north-east to south-west, thro' the heads of those rivers: and that this line having thus become their western boundary, all the lands beyond it must be considered as waste territories of the crown, not subject to any colonial jurisdiction; in which case they must have been vested in the United States by the cession from Great-Britain in the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>In order to decide how far this principle is well-founded; it will be proper to advert to the words of the proclamation itself; to the manner in which the British government acted under it before the revolution: and to the construction which it has received from the several states, and the govern∣ment of the United States, since they became in∣dependant.</P>
<P>From a careful review of the proclamation it∣self, and a comparison of the various parts with each other, it seems evident that the clauses in question were intended, not as a restriction of the territorial limits of the colonies, but <HI>an instruc∣tion to the governors respecting the time, place, and manner, of granting lands and making settlements.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035588_0020_1005F76A8D0CCA30"/>
The proclamation appears to have had five ob∣jects in view. 1. To erect certain new govern∣ments composed of the territories which Great-Britain had recently acquired by her treaties of peace, with France and Spain. 2. To annex cer∣tain additional territories to some of the govern∣ments, then existing. 3. To reward the land and naval forces of Britain, which had served in Ame∣rica during the war, by an allotment of land in the colonies. 4. To protect the Indians in the safe and quiet possession of such lands as it was thought proper to reserve for their use and: 5. To regulate trade between them and the colonists. There is no hint of an intention to restrict the li∣mits of the colonies by a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers, or in any other manner. Had that been the intention of the British government, it would probably have been expressly declared; it having always been its practice to make alterations in the boundaries of its provinces in a very express and solemn manner, and usually in consequence of representations from the board of trade and plantations. This was the case in the extension of Georgia to the river St. Mary's, by this very proclamation, and of West Florida, to the mouth of the Yazoo afterwards; both which took place in consequence of recommendations from the board of trade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Act. gen. report 135, 133. And appendix No. 2. &amp; 3.</NOTE>. It being intended also to extend the governments of Novia Scotia, and Newfound∣land, the extensions were made by this proclama∣tion in the most express and formal manner. It does not therefore seem in the least degree proba∣ble, that so important a measure as the cutting off one half of all the colonies, those at least which were royal governments, if intended, should have
<PB N="19" REF="035588_0021_1005EBE79E18A6A0"/>been left to mere implication; to expressions, which even taken singly, many bear a very dif∣ferent import.</P>
<P>The clauses which contain those expressions, are confined to the fourth object of the proclamation, which they appear to have had solely in view, viz. "To protect the Indians, in the, safe and quiet possession of such lands as it was thought proper to reserve for their use." They are introduced by a preamble, which states, "That it was just and reasonable, and essential to the interests and secu∣rity of the British government and its colonies, that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom it was connected, and who lived under its protec∣tion, should not be disturbed or molested in the possession of such parts of its dominions and terri∣tories, as not having been ceded to, or purchas∣ed by it, were reserved to them or any of them, <HI>as their hunting grounds."</HI> In order to prevent this disturbance and molestation, various measures, are adopted. First the governors of Quebec, East Flori∣da, and West Florida, the three new governments, are forbidden to grant any warrants of survey, or patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their re∣spective governments." Secondly the governors of the other colonies are forbidden, <HI>"For the pre∣sent</HI> and <HI>until the further pleasure</HI> of <HI>the crown should be known,</HI> to grant warrants of survey or pass pa∣tents for any lands <HI>beyond the heads or sources</HI> of <HI>any</HI> of <HI>the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean, from the west, or north-west;</HI> or upon any lands, which not having been ceded to, or purchased by the crown, were reserved to the Indians or any of them." Thirdly all the lands not included within the limits of the three new governments, or of the Hadsons Bay Company; and "all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of
<PB N="20" REF="035588_0022_1005F76E653AC300"/>the rivers, which fall into the sea from the west and north-west," were declared to be reserved, <HI>for the present,</HI> under the sovereignty, protection, and dominion of the crown, for the use of the Indians. And all persons were forbidden from making any purchases or settlements, or taking possession of any lands within those reservations. Fourthly, all per∣sons, who, either wilfully or inadvertently, had seated themselves upon any of the land so reserv∣ed, or upon any other land which, not having been ceded to or purchased by the crown, were still re∣served for the Indians, were ordered immediately to remove. And fifthly, it was provided that in future "no private person should presume to make any purchase from the Indians of any lands reserv∣ed to them <HI>within those parts of the colonies where the crown had allowed settlement,</HI> but that if the Indi∣ans should at any time be inclined to sell such lands they should be purchased only for the crown and in its name, at some public meeting of the Indians held for that purpose, by the governor of the co∣lony respectively within which they lay. And in case they should lie within the limits of any pro∣prietaries, then conformable to such instructions as the crown or the proprietaries should give."</P>
<P>On these regulations it is observable, in the first place, that they are all parts of a system the avow∣ed object and scope of which was to protect the In∣dians, not to alter or abridge the limits of colo∣nies. To this object all of them were important; nor was that which respected the lands west of the heads of the rivers less so than any of the others. As those lands lay at a great distance from the set∣tled parts of the colonies, they were beyond the reach of protection from the colonial governments; and it was therefore important that they should, while reserved for the Indians, be taken under the
<PB N="21" REF="035588_0023_1005F771F2546E10"/>immediate protection of the crown, which possess∣ing a military force upon the frontiers could more readily and effectually repel those inroads and in∣croachments which it was the object of this system to prevent. The lands below the sources of the rivers on the contrary, being nearer to the seats of the colonial governments, might derive the necessa∣ry protection from that source.</P>
<P>As to the terms "sovereignty and dominion of the crown" which are applied to the lands above the heads of the rivers, they mean nothing; for all parts of the colonies were equally under the sov∣reignty and dominion of the crown, the proprieta∣ry governments excepted. Even they were so to many intents, and where they were exempted from sovereignty by their charters, it was not in the power of the crown to bring them under it again by a proclamation.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, in the second place, that this "sovereignty, protection, and dominion" were only to be "for the present" and while the lands were "reserved for the use of the Indians." It was therefore a temporary regulation; not a per∣manent change in the limits of a province, and was to cease as soon as the Indians should think fit to relinquish the lands, and the crown to permit the settlement of them. They were then to be under the government of that colony within whose limits they lay; to form part of it as before.</P>
<P>The same remark is applicable to the prohibition against granting warrants or patents for lands a∣bove the heads of the rivers. It was only for the present" that they were prohibited: which shows that the prohibition was a temporary regulation on∣ly, the lands still continuing a part of the colonies respectively to which they belonged before, and the governors of which, when the prohibition should
<PB N="22" REF="035588_0024_1005F77384045DB8"/>be removed, would go on to grant the lands as formerly.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in the third place, that the pro∣clamation speaks of "lands reserved for the Indi∣ans within those parts of the colonies where the crown had thought proper to allow settlement" and those lands whenever the Indians should be dispos∣ed to sell them, were to be purchased by the go∣vernors in the name of the crown and for its use. Settlements were therefore permitted in parts of the colonies where the lands had been reserved for the Indians! This could apply only to lands be∣low the heads of the rivers which had not been purchased or ceded; for above the heads of the rivers settlement was absolutely prohibited; and it proves that "to reserve lands far the Indians," did not take them out of the limits of the colony. There were also <HI>parts of the colonies</HI> where settlement was forbidden. This could apply only to the lands above the heads of the rivers; for below them, set∣tlement was permitted, provided the land was pre∣viously purchased from the Indians. Consequent∣ly the lands above the heads of the rivers, though reserved for the Indians under the special protec∣tion of the crown, and forbidden to be settled without its express license, were nevertheless con∣sidered as "parts of the colonies," within whose former limits they lay.</P>
<P>The difference made by the proclamation be∣tween the lands above, and those below the heads of the rivers, seems to be this, that both continu∣ing to be part of the colonies, the latter might be settled whenever they could be purchased from the Indians conformably the established regula∣tions: whereas the former, however willing the Indians might be, could not be settled or purchased without the express permission of the crown: the
<PB N="23" REF="035588_0025_1005F776E7ECBBD0"/>reasons of which distinction have been hinted at above, and indeed are sufficiently obvious.</P>
<P>It is to be observed in the last place, that these provisions extend to all the colonies, both royal and proprietary: some of which last description, particularly Pennsylvania, possessed extensive terri∣tories beyond the heads of the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic from the west and north-west. Although the crown might, and frequently did, execute a general superintending power over the proprietary governments, as well as its other colo∣nies might regulate their trade, protect the Indians, and prescribe the manner in which lands should be purchased or settled; it certainly neither had, or, claimed a right to alter, much less curtail their limits. This is evident from the whole tenor of its conduct, respecting the colonies, as well as from the nature of the proprietary charters them∣selves; which being in the nature of grants invest∣ed the proprietors with the right of soil. This right the crown could no more take from them then it could deprive indiviuals of any other pro∣perty which they possessed and accordingly we have seen that it never meddled with the Virginia ter∣ritory until the company's charter had been legal∣ly vacated by a quo warranto. Nor was it till af∣ter the council of Plymouth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hazard's col. vol. i. p. 390. also act p. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>, the lords proprietors of Carolina, and the trustees of Georgia, had re∣spectively surrendered their charters, that the crown proceeded to make any disposition of their territories. It can hardly be presumed that it would so suddenly have departed from its constant maxims of conduct, and from the known princi∣ples of its laws, as to attempt regulations by which the proprietary government of Pennsylvania would have been deprived at once of nearly half its ter∣ritories.
<PB N="24" REF="035588_0026_1005F7796350C580"/>Yet this must have been the effect of the clauses in question had they been considered as a restriction of limits, rather than temporary instruc∣tion to the governors.</P>
<P>It is moreover an invarible rule in the exposi∣tion of legal acts, that in case of ambiguity any construction by which they can be rendered consis∣tent with right is to be preferred. But to consider these clauses as a restriction of boundary, would render them directly repugnant to the plain and acknowledged rights of the proprietary govern∣ments. Whereas to regard them merely as in∣structions to the governors respecting the time and manner of making settlements, will reconcile them equally to the rights of the proprietors and of the crown: and this is the intention with which the proclamation, considered in itself, and taken un∣der all these points of view, appears to have been made</P>
<P>The construction thus obviously deducible from the words and tenor of the instrument itself, is strongly supported by the conduct of the British government, before the revolution. It must here be repeated and constantly keep in view, that these provisions extended, not only to South-Carolina, and Georgia, but to all the colonies whose terri∣tories lay above and below the heads of the rivers, falling in the Atlantic from the west and north∣west of this number, were New-York, Pennsylva∣nia, Virginia, and North-Carolina; besides South-Carolina, and Georgia. It is perfectly well known that between the proclamation of 1763, and the revolution, at a time when the British go∣vernment still subsisted in Virginia, she extended her settlements beyond the heads of the rivers, falling into the Atlantic. Many of the settlements or Polston, New River, Greenbriar, and other waters falling into the Ohio, were of this descrip∣tion,
<PB N="25" REF="035588_0027_1005F77AF28FA250"/>and they were made not only with the per∣mission, but under the authority, of the British go∣vernment. It is not known at what time the grants of land were made under which these set∣tlements took place but it is perfectly certain that the settlements themselves were always considered, as well after the proclamation as before, as being part of Virginia and that the laws were administered in them, under the authority, and in the name of its colonial government. This, it is most evident, could not have been the case, had the proclama∣tion of 1763, been considered as curtailing the co∣lonies, and restricting them to a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers. In that case these settle∣ments, so far from going on and increasing under the government of Virginia, must have been cut off from the colony; and the exercise of authority there by its governor, would have been regarded as an act of usurpation. But his we know was not the case. If Virginia was not curtailed neither were the other colonies; for the clauses in question apply equally to them all. From whence it is most evident that the crown considered, and intend∣ed these clauses as no more then a temporary in∣striction to its governors about the time and man∣ner of making settlements; the extent and boun∣daries of the colonies, when it should permit set∣tlements, remaining still the same.</P>
<P>It is equally clear that the subject has always been viewed in the same light by the states them∣selves since the revolution, and by the government of the United States. Not to speak of Georgia, which, as we have already seen, passed an act in 1783, to declare and establish her territorial li∣mits, it is well known, that South-Carolina grant∣ed large grantees of land thro' all the country from the mountains to the Mississippi, which grants she afterwards vacated, not because she had
<PB N="26" REF="035588_0028_1005F77E93D502D8"/>no right to make them, but because the land had not been purchased from the Indians. She after∣wards ceded her claim to the United States. North-Carolina too opened a land-office in 1784, and granted several millions of acres between the Mississippi, and the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic. She afterwards ceded the terri∣tory to the United States, subject to these grants; and subject to them it was accepted; nor was the validity of the grants, except so far as related to the possessory right of the Indians, ever been dis∣puted. Indeed the whole state of Tenessee is held by this very tenure. Before the cession this county was considered as part of North-Carolina, as such was governed, and as such had a represen∣tative in the Congress of the United States. In the same manner, Virginia sold the whole Kentucky country, and then erected it into a state; it having remained in the mean time, under her laws, and a part of her state for many years; many and exten∣sive districts, which still constitute parts of Virginia, and as such send members to Congress, lie beyond the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlan∣tic. All these settlements, grants, and cessions, have proceeded upon the principle that the western limits of the colonies were not altered by the pro∣clamation of 1763. Otherwise all the grants of North-Carolina in Tenessee, and of Virginia in Kentucky, would be illegal; and a very consider∣able part of the territory still claimed and possessed by the latter state, must be lopt off from her.</P>
<P>Until therefore it shall be shewn that the clauses in question apply exclusively to South-Carolina, and Georgia, or that the same rules of construction which have been universally adopted and admitted, with respect to the other states, ought not to ap∣ply to them likewise, it seems perfectly clear that
<PB N="27" REF="035588_0029_1005F78101190568"/>whether we regard the proclamation of 1763, itself the acts of the British governments under it, or the construction which has been given to it by own governments since the revolution, it cannot be considered as having curtailed the western boun∣dary of those states.</P>
<P>From whence it results that the United Stares, can found no claim to the lands in question, on this proclamation.</P>
<P>Their claim however, to these lands, or a part of them, is supported on another principle which must be next examined. It is said that altho' Ca∣rolina, originally extended as far south as Florida, yet when the proprietors surrendered their charter, and these territories became re-vested in the crown, the southern limits of that province were restrict∣ed by the establishment of Georgia: that the ri∣vers Savannah, and Alatamaha, having been fit as the limits of Georgia, all the lands south o st were cut off from the government of South-Caro∣lina, and continued to be waste territories of the crown, till part of them were annext to Georgia by the proclamation of sixty three: that this pro∣clamation however, extending only to the lands, "between the Alatamaha, and the St. Mary's," could not include the territory which lay above the heads of those rivers; and that this territory there∣fore continued to be waste land, not annext to any government, nor part of any colony, till the treaty of peace, by which it was vested in the United states By this pretension, if established, they would gain all the country, bounded by the Floridas, the Mississippi, and a line drawn from the head of the St. Mary's, to that of the Alatamaha, and from thence due west to the Mississippi.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more uncertain than the lati∣tude of this last line. If the position of the sources,
<PB N="28" REF="035588_0030_1005F7828F97CE58"/>of the Alatamaha were known, which is very far from being the case, it would still be very diffi∣cult to ascertain what ought to be considered as the head of the river: whether the place where it takes the name of the Alatamaha, its nighest source from the sea, or its most southern source, be intended by the charter as the place from where the west line is to be drawn. It has been thought that the most Southern source is meant; but this is far from being fully justified by the words of the char∣ter, which evidently refer to the most southern <HI>mouth</HI> of the river; it being known to enter the sea by several channels. The words are, "From the most northern stream, of a river, there com∣monly called the Savannah, all along the sea coast, to the southward, to the most southern stream of a certain other great water or river, called the Alatamaha, and westward, from the heads of of the said rivers respectively to the South-Sea." It: seems probable however, that the <HI>highest source from the sea,</HI> was the point from whence the west line was intended to be drawn: and tho' this source will remain for a long time uncertain, even should the claim be established, yet it may be af∣firmed not to lie so far north, as to affect the pur∣chase of the upper Mississippi company, whose most southern extent is no more than twenty-five miles south of the north boundary of Georgia.</P>
<P>The claim however, could certainly include a great, perhaps far the greater part of the Geor∣gia company's purchase.</P>
<P>This claim rests on two questions. 1. Whether the lands south of Georgia, continued to be a part of South-Carolina, after the former colony was erected? 2. Whether the whole of them were an∣next to Georgia, by the proclamation of 1763, or that part only which lay below the heads of the Alatamaha, and St. Mary's. If they continued to
<PB N="29" REF="035588_0031_1005F7851F086988"/>be part of South-Carolina, the cession of that state, by the convention of Beaufort, vested in Georgia such parts of them as were not affected by the pro∣clamation of 1763. If they were all affected by that proclamation, then the right of Georgia was complete independantly of the cession from South-Carolina.</P>
<P>As to the first point, it is to be regretted that more satisfactory documents for the investigation of it, cannot be resorted to. The papers most likely to decide it with absolute certainty, are the commissions and instructions, given to the govern∣ors of South-Carolina, between the years 1732, when the colony of Georgia, was erected and 1763, the date of the proclamation. Those docu∣ments no doubt exist in the office of trade, and plantations in London. An official enquiry was made from a gentleman having access to the re∣cords of that office, and he furnished some extracts and copies; but others of a very important nature were omitted. From such documents however, as can be recurred to the following points seem to be satisfactorily established.</P>
<P>First that after the surrender of their charter by the Lords Proprietors, the jurisdiction of the Royal governors of South Carolina extended over the whole country which had been included in that charter</P>
<P>It appears by a representation from the board of trade and plantations to the king, on the 1st of December 1727 that a fort was at that time kept up on the Alatamaha river under the government of South Carolina, and had been for some years; and the continuation of it under the same authority is advised<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep ort, 30.</NOTE>. And on the 10th of June, 1730; the governor of South Carolina was instructed to lay out Townships and grant lands on the Alata∣meha<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035588_0032_1005F7879A2E6480"/>
Secondly that when the Colony of Georgia was erected the country of which it was composed was considered by the British government as part of South-Carolina.</P>
<P>Lord Percival, Oglethorpe and others who first projected the Georgia scheme, petitioned the crown for a grant of land <HI>in South-Carolina,</HI> for that purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep. 84.</NOTE>. In the reports of the board of trade on this petition, Georgia is called "the colony to be established; in South-Carolina<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 87</NOTE>." After the establishment of the colony the command of its militia was to <HI>remain</HI> with the governor of South-Carolina.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 912</NOTE>Even in the charter, the lands to be in∣cluded are described as "lying and being in that part of South-Carolina in America which lies &amp;c."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 91.</NOTE>. Lord Granville's part of South-Carolina not having, at that time, been separately allotted to him, his right in this country as one of the pro∣prietors, was admitted still to exist; and according∣ly the charter granted only seven eighths of the land to the trustees<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 100.</NOTE>, to whom Lord Grenville afterwards conveyed his eighth. And in an in∣struction to the Governor of South-Carolina, of a date subsequent to the charter, Georgia is mention∣ed as "a Colony settled within the bounds of the province of South-Carolina" and the governor of that province is instructed to register the charter among its records<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that after the establishment of Georgia the lands south of its southern boundary still re∣mained, and were considered by the crown as be∣ing, under the jurisdiction of South-Carolina, and of consequence a part of that province.</P>
<P>It apperas by a representation from the governor of Georgia, dated October 17th 1761, that there
<PB N="31" REF="035588_0033_1005F78AF6BC92C0"/>was then, and long had been a military post kept up on Cumberland Island, far south of the Alata∣maha, "under the direction and authority of the governor of South-Carolina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen Rep. 111.</NOTE>". The governor of South-Carolina too, in a letter to the board of trade dated August 17th 1763, affirms that there was then, and had been for many years, a post to the south∣ward of the Alatamaha garrisoned by detachments from that province<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 118.</NOTE>. But this point is more strongly confirmed by the proceedings which took place with respect to certain lands lying south of the Alatamaha and granted by the governor of South-Carolina in the year 1762. These grants being complained of by the governor of Gorgia, the board of trade and plantations reproved the governor of South-Carolina for making them; not on the ground of his possessing no jurisdiction, but because "the making of grants for lands in that country was contrary to the intentions of the crown, and might not only embarrass the execution of those arrangements which would probably be∣come necessary from the cession of Florida, but in∣terfere also with the measures about to be taken for the extension of Gorgia<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 115.</NOTE>. The governor justified his conduct by alledging that his province still extended as far south as the limits fixt by the charter of Carolina to the lords proprietors, except as to suchland as had been expressly included with∣in the charter of Georgia<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 117.</NOTE>. In a subsequént re∣presentation from the board of trade to the crown they seem to admit that these grants were made "conformably to the governors instructions<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 144.</NOTE>." And they expressly recommend that an act of the Georgia legislature, passed after that province had been extended to the St. Marys and tending to
<PB N="32" REF="035588_0034_1005F78D9EECB7B0"/>subject the grantees of those lands to improper conditions, should not receive the royal assent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. Rep. 141</NOTE>. Transcripts of those grants were afterwards ordered by the crown to be registered in Georgia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 144.</NOTE>. And the grants themselves thus virtually confirmed, have ever since been, and still are, considered as valid.</P>
<P>All these proceedings must have been founded on the principle that the lands south of the South∣ern boundary of Georgia, as first established by its charter, continued to be a part of South-Carolina till the proclamation of 1763, annext them or part of them at least, to the former province.</P>
<P>How indeed could they cease to be so? nothing is more clear then that all this country was includ∣ed within the province of South-Carolina at and before the establishment of Georgia. This has been abundantly proved<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sapaa. p. 55, 56 57,</NOTE>. But the charter of Georgia could affect those lands only which were included within its limits; nor was that province ever understood, either by its own governors or the crown, to extend further<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Att. gen. rep. 111, 105.115.135.140.</NOTE>. All the rest of the country, of course, remained as it was before, until a further desposition of it was made by some new act of the crown. It is not pretended that any such acts took place till the proclamation of 1763<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 18 117.</NOTE>. The circumstance of this country being sepa∣rated from the rest of Carolina by the intervening province of Georgia does not alter the case: for it is by no means necessary, nor does it always happen, that all the territories of a government should lie adjoining. The province of Maine we know, un∣der the royal government was, and at this day continues to be, a part of Massachussetts, tho' New-Hampshire lies between them; and Connecti∣cut
<PB N="33" REF="035588_0035_1005F78F4F6B4BD0"/>by virtue of her charter, which extended west to the Mississippi, claims and actually holds, lands on lake Erie, notwithstanding that New-York, New-Jersey, and Pennsylvania intervene.</P>
<P>There are however two passages which might seem at first view to contradict this opinion; but it is believed that on examination they will apppear in a different light.</P>
<P>In a report to the crown by the board of trade and plantations, on which the proclamation of 1763 was founded, it is stated "that a large tract of land lying between the North boundary of East Florida and the river Alatamaha, <HI>which had hi∣herto been unoccupied as to any permament settlement,</HI> remained to be put under some proper establish∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep. 135.</NOTE>".</P>
<P>On this passage it is to be observed that <HI>occupation</HI> and <HI>right</HI> are distinct things; so that the circum∣stance of this country's not having been occupied by South-Carolina, would by no means prove that it was not under the jurisdiction, did not from part, of that province. It is not said, moreover, that this country had not been occupied at all; that would have been contrary to the fact; for as we have seen, a post had been kept up in it and gar∣risoned from South-Carolina; but that it had not been occupied <HI>as to permament settlement.</HI> But it is a well known principle of law that a legal possession where necessary, may be maintained without a permanent settlement. Had actual possession in this case been necessary, which may well be doubt∣ed, the continued occupation by a military post would have been sufficient.</P>
<P>The board of trade is said to have laid the above-mentioned grants before the crown lawyers, for an opinion on their validity, and to have alledged at the same time "that the province of South-Carolina

<P>It is to be remarked in the first place, that the crown lawyers did not give an opinion, at least not an unfavourable one, on the subject of these grants: from whence it may be inferred that after an ex∣amination of the subject, they did not concur in the objections of the board. Secondly, that the assertion of the board, even if true, amounts to nothing; the right to possess, and the exercise of that right, being things altogether distinct. And thirdly, that the assertion is not true; it being evi∣dent from the documents already adduced that the province of South-Carolina had always maintained possession of that country, at least till the year 1762, by a military post.</P>
<P>It seems therefore clearly to result from all these considerations that the country south of the Alata∣maha not only was a part of South-Carolina pre∣viously to the establishment of Georgia, but conti∣nued to be so afterwards until the proclamation of 1763. The facts stated indeed relate wholly to the country near the sea coast, because that alone hav∣ing been settled by the English or even known to them, the interior parts were never expressly con∣templated by the acts of their government. But the principles on which those acts were founded apply equally to every part of the territory south of the ancient southern boundary of Georgia. South-Carolina could claim near the coast in virtue only of her charter, and that charter gave an equal claim to all the land contained within its limits and not included in those of Georgia. The right therefore which they possessed on the shores of the
<PB N="35" REF="035588_0037_1005F79505725920"/>Atlantic before the year 1763, extended equally to the banks of the Mississippi, and by her cession at Beaufort in 1788, was completely vested in the state of Georgia.</P>
<P>As to the second point, whether the proclama∣tion of 1763, annexed to Georgia all the land ly∣ing between her ancient southern boundary and the northern limits of the Floridas, or such part only as actually lay between the Alatamaha and St. Mary's below their sources? the dicision of it, if now necessary, might be attended with some dif∣ficulty. The words of the proclamation are "We have also, with the advice of our privy council aforesaid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen rep. 38.</NOTE>." Nothing else is said on the subject. From these expressions, and some others used by the board of trade and plantations in different com∣munications<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 135.140.</NOTE>to the crown on this matter, it would seem that those lands only which lay below the heads of the rivers were contemplated. But this point seems to have been decided, as far as relates to the United States, by the government itself. In a report from the Secretary of State, intended as the basis of instructions to our commissioners for treating with Spain, the latitude 31, is insisted on as the southern boundary of Georgia "established between that province and Florida by the procla∣mation of 1763<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. 9. An extract from the representation.</NOTE>." And in the representation made by our commissioners December 17th 1793, the same thing is repeated, and urged to the court of Spain as the foundation of our right.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The same principle is repeated, and urged on the court of Spain, by Mr Pinckney, the American minister for negociating the last treaty with that power, so lately as August 10th, 1795, several months after the sales in question had been formally notifie to the government. See app. No. 16.
<P>An extract from Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> representation, of Aug. 10th, 9795, to the Spanish court.</P></NOTE> It might
<PB N="36" REF="035588_0038_1005F79694080D40"/>perhaps be thought doubtful how far these decla∣tions would preclude the government in a court of law; but we can hardly suppose that it would con∣tend for a principle formally and expressly contra∣dicted by its own solemn acts; which it must do were it to urge a claim against the state of Geor∣gia for any of these lands, founded on a supposi∣tion that the whole of them, down to the Missis∣sippi and the latitude 31, were not annexed to that state by the proclamation in question.</P>
<P>The third and only remaining ground on which the United States can rest their claim to a part of this territory, is the extension of West Florida after the year 1763.</P>
<P>It is contended that the British crown having previously to the year 1770, and while all the co∣lonies were subject to its dominion, extended West Florida up to the mouth of the Yazoo and a line drawn due left from thence to the Apilachi∣cola, by instructions and commissions to its go∣vernors, all the county between that line and the latitude 31, ceasing to belong either to South-Ca∣rolina or Georgia, became a part of West Florida, and being thus placed without the jurisdiction of any state in the Union, was ceded, by the treaty of peace, to the United States.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more certain than the principle that all the lands ceded by Great Britain in the treaty of peace, and not included within the limits of any state, became vested in the United States. Nor can there be any doubt that as both Carolina and Georgia were royal governments in the year 1770, the crown had a right at that time to alter, abridge, or extend their limits at its pleasure; to take parts of their territories and annex them to old governments or erect them into new ones. It was by the exercise of this right that after Virginia became a royal government in 1624,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra, p. 9, 10.</NOTE> part of its
<PB N="37" REF="035588_0039_1005F79944E0B3F8"/>territory, all south of the latitude 36, 30, was included in the grant of Carolina: that after the surrender by the lords proprietors, Carolina itself was divided into two governments, and Georgia carved out of one of them; and that the country south of the first boundary established for Georgia was afterwards annexed to that province.</P>
<P>As to the mode of exercising this right there may be more room for doubt. It may be said that when the limits of a province had been fixed by a procla∣mation or charter, which are public and solemn acts, they ought not to be altered, and could not legally, by acts of <HI>a less solemn</HI> nature; such as commissions or instructions. But this objection does not seem to have any weight; because tho' commissions and instructions, especially the for∣mer, were not published in the same manner with proclamations, they were nevertheless published, and with circumstances of sufficient notority; being entered of record not only in the office of trade and plantations, but also in the provinces; where they were moreover publicly read. They received in∣deed a greater degree of publicity than charters, which were recorded only, without being promul∣gated in any manner. As to authenticity, these commissions were acts of the king in council, un∣der the great seal, as well as proclamations or let∣ters patent, and therefore of equal authority. As the crown, besides, possessed the right of altering boundaries it might certainly exercise that right in whatever manner it thought fit: and indeed the extent of the royal colonies depended, in many instances, on the commissions to governors, and was regulated by them. Of this Virginia, Caro∣lina, and Georgia, are examples; which after they became royal governments, were continued according to their ancient limits, not by new let∣ters
<PB N="38" REF="035588_0040_1005F79C977E1960"/>patent, but merely by the commissions to their respective governors.</P>
<P>It therefore seems undeniable, that by this ex∣tension of Florida, the territory which it affected was entirely cut off from Georgia, or South-Ca∣rolina, to which ever of them it belonged, and rendered completely a part of Florida; from which it necessarily follows that this territory was ceded by the treaty of peace to the United States, not to Georgia, and vested in them.</P>
<P>As the mouth of the Yazoo, however, lies in latitude 32, 30<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix, No. 6.—an extract from the representation of Purcell, who surveyed that country, under the authority of the British government.</NOTE>, or thereabout, it is clear that this claim of the United States does not affect the upper Mississippi commpany's purchase, which cannot extend further south than latitude 34, "30". But a very considerable part of the Geor∣gia company's purchase, will lie below a line to be drawn due east from the mouth of the Yazoo. Its southern boundary between the Mississippi and Donbigby, is higher up than that line; namely in latitude 32, 40, but between the Donbigby and Alabama, it extends down nearly to latitude 31. In this quarter consequently, a great part of its lands are included in the claim of the United States.</P>
<P>How far is this claim still valid against the com∣pany? Admitting that these lands belonged to the United States at the time of the sale, was it attend∣ed or preceded by any conduct on their part which will render it valid against them, in the eye of the law? This was the second point proposed for ex∣amination.</P>
<P>On this point two questions arise which ought to be distinctly considered: first whether the con∣duct of the United States respecting this territory at the sale, and previous to it, was such as, if
<PB N="39" REF="035588_0041_1005F79F288B7888"/>persued by an individual under similar circumstan∣ces, would have rendered the sale binding on him? and secondly whether the same principles will ap∣ply to the government?</P>
<P>As to the first, there is no rule better established in the courts of equity than this, that whoever, knowingly and without constraint, acquiesces in a disposition of his property, for a valuable consi∣deration, by a person who pretended and appear∣ed to have the right, shall be bound by the disposi∣tion: it being a maxim of law, "That silence im∣plies content; and that he who does'not forbid an act when he has a right, and an opportunity to do so, orders it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Equi. ca. abr. 357.—case of Hanning, v. Ferrets.</NOTE>." This rule rule has been long ad∣mitted in the courts of equity, and is abundantly supported by the authorities cited at the bottom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hudsden, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.—Raw, v. Pole, 2 Vern. 239.—Ibbotson, v. Rhodes, 2. Vern. 554.—Berrisford, v. Milward.—Barpard, Chan. 101, 102.—Peter, v. Russel, 2. Vern. 726.—Hobbs, v.

Vezey, 6.—Mocatta, v. Murga∣troyd, 1. P. W. 393—Head, v. Eguton, 3. P. W. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But he must acquiese "knowingly," that is he must understand the nature of the act about to be done: for he is bound on the principle of having assented; and a person cannot assent to what he did not know. He must also acquiese, "without constraint," for there can be no assent where there is not freedom.</P>
<P>And the person who makes the disposition, must not only claim a right, but appear to possess it; for whoever should make a purchase from one who neither claimed, nor appeared to possess, a right to sell, could blame none but himself, and must sustain the loss as a punishment for his own folly.</P>
<P>But if the owner should not only acquiese in the
<PB N="40" REF="035588_0042_1005F7A0B536ECC0"/>sale, but give colour by his conduct to the right of the seller, and in that or any other manner encou∣rage the purchasor to buy, he will by stronger reason, be bound to confirm the sale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the cases cited above.</NOTE>. This principle also is fully established by the authorities already cited.</P>
<P>Let these rules be applied to the acts of the state of Georgia and the conduct of the United States respecting this territory, previously to the sale in question. It will appear that the latter not only acquiesed, but encouraged: that they not only saw in silence all the acts of ownership exercised by Georgia over this land, all her acts preparatory to the sale, and the sale itself, but by their own proceedings gave colour and sanction to her ti∣tle.</P>
<P>As early as the year 1783, Georgia began to assert her claim to these lands. In that year she passed an act declaring them to lie within her char∣ter-limits, and holding out encouragement to per∣sons to settle on them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the act, p. 19.</NOTE>. To this proceeding the United States made no objection.</P>
<P>In 1795, knowing that the Indian claims had been extinguished in a tract of land on the Mis∣sissippi, below the mouth of the Yazoo, and be∣lieving that extinguishment, as it was within the limits she claimed, to have enured to her benefit, she erected that tract into a county, and offered new encouragement to settlers. She moreover, at the same time, declared her intention of open∣ing a land office for the sale of the lands<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 19, 20.</NOTE>. To this proceeding the United States made no ob∣jection.</P>
<P>Sometime afterwards a dispute arose between the two states, South-Carolina, and Georgia, about
<PB N="41" REF="035588_0043_1005F7A349BB8FD8"/>this territory, and it was referred to congress; which thus received express notice of the claims of those states, but made no objection to them, al∣ledged no right in itself. This dispute was after∣wards settled, and South-Carolina ceded her claims to Georgia. The act of cession was com∣municated to congress; and congress made no ob∣jection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See act p. 23.</NOTE>; so far indeed was she from objecting that on the 20th of October, 1787, after this cession had been communicated to her, she made a public, and formal requisition, on the state of Georgia; for a cession of her territory<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 24.—See also the President's proclamation against James, v. Fallon, in 1790.</NOTE>. This act, done under a complete knowledge of all the circumstan∣ces, was a very strong recognition of the right of that state.</P>
<P>In 1789, Georgia, passed an act for the sale of these lands to certain companies; one of the com∣panies attempted a settlement and sent an agent; all this was known to the government of the Unit∣ed States, which issued a proclamation against cer∣tain acts of the agent, but said not a word against the sale, or about any right of the United States, to the land<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Jour. of Congress, vol, 12. p. 21. —And appendix No. 15. the resolution itself.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two years after this the government of the U∣nited States, being engaged in a dispute with Spain about this country, expressly declared, in an of∣ficial representation, that it belonged to Georgia by virtue of her charters, and the proclamation of 1763, and rested their claim to it as part of their territories, intirely on her title.</P>
<P>What higher sanction to a title could an indivi∣dual, or a government hold out? What stronger acknowledgment than this long acquiescence, fol∣lowed by this express declaration, when the subject
<PB N="41" REF="035588_0044_1005F7A69ADC8A88"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="035588_0045_1005F7A90142A1C0"/>had been so often discussed, the claim so often re∣newed? The government not only suffer Geor∣gia repeatedly to say, "This is my land," with∣out contradicting her; to sell it once without in∣terposing; but, not content with this tacit acqui∣escence, joins in the assertion, and lays in a so∣lemn act, "This is the land of Georgia." The question may be repeated, what stronger encou∣ragement can be given to purchasers?</P>
<P>Even after the last sale had been made, of which the government was formally notified by the go∣vernor of Georgia, no sufficient steps were taken to warn the purchasers of their danger, and pre∣vent them from completing the payment. When the government received this notice only, fifty thousand dollars out of five hundred thousand had been paid. The rest was not due till some months af∣ter. Even then the government set up no claim, made no interference. It merely held up the idea that it might possibly possess a right, by directing its law officers to institute an enquiry into the title of Georgia. Even this idea they did not plainly intimate, much less expressly declare. Their re∣solution directs the Attorney general, "To col∣lect, digest, and report, <HI>to the next congress,</HI> the charters treaties, and other documents, relative to, and explanatory, of the title to the lands situate in the southwestern parts of the United States, and claimed by certain companies under a law of the state of Georgia." How was it to be understood from this proceeding that the government claimed the land! with what justice could purchasers, who contracted under the strong previous assurances, which have been stated and after this last transaction paid their money, be called upon for the purchas∣ed property, by that very party which had thus led them into the contract?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="035588_0046_1005F7AA927BEF00"/>
But was the government apprized of their right? Was it unknown to the purchasers them∣selves? These two questions deserve to be consi∣dered.</P>
<P>As to the first, it is to be observed that every person is presumed in law to be acquainted with his own rights. This principle is founded on the best reasons. If a person, having a right to land, should stand silently by, and see it sold, and then be permited to reclaim it under pretence, that he was ignorant of his title, a pretence which it would frequently be impossible to disprove, the greatest frauds might be committed. It would therefore be presumed by the courts that he knew his own title, unless he gave very good proof to the con∣trary, and he would be bound by the sale. Most of the decisions indeed have been in cases where the party was expressly stated to have been acquaint∣ed with his own title; but there are some where this does not appear; and in one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hudsden, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.</NOTE>, the owner, who was a woman, declared on oath that she was ignorant of her right: yet as she was present at the sale, and did not object, she was decreed to be bound. This must have been on the prin∣ciple that every one is presumed to understand his own rights.</P>
<P>This principle however, could apply only in cases where the party had a reasonable opportuni∣ty of knowing them; for if he were in circum∣stances which rendered that knowledge impossible he could not, on any principle of justice, be con∣sidered as having consented to their alienation. In the abovementioned case the woman, tho' ig∣norant of her title, was in a situation which ena∣bled
<PB N="44" REF="035588_0047_1005F7AD0DC567E8"/>her to become acquainted with it by proper attention and enquiry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also the case of Hobbs, v. Norton, 1. Equi. la. Abr. 356.</NOTE>. And the United States also might easily have acquired the most complete knowledge of their claim to the land in question.</P>
<P>In cases moreover, of mere silent acquiescence, a party might perhaps be allowed to disprove his own knowledge. Even this would be very doubt∣ful. But where he had given positive and express confirmation to the right of the seller, and had thus encouraged the purchaser to buy, he could never be allowed to claim the property in contra∣diction to his own declarations. Silence about his right might be occasioned, and therefore, perhaps, excused, by ignorance of it; but that ignorance could never be a sufficient inducement, or a justi∣fication, for his declaring the right to be in ano∣ther. If he chose ignorantly to make such a de∣claration, he himself, not the innocent purchaser, must abide the consequence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the above acted case of Hobbs, v. Norton.</NOTE>. In this predica∣ment is the government of the United States; which not content with silently acquiescing in the acts of Georgia, has made the strongest declara∣tions in favour of her right.</P>
<P>And lastly there is good reason to believe that the government was actually apprized of its right to this land. The extension of Florida, took place in 1770. In 1777 the Indian claims in the Na∣tehez district, which lies within the limits of this extension, were extinguished by the British govern∣ment. At the treaty held at Hopewell, in 1786, between the United States and the Chacktaws, the former, in order to preclude the Indians from the Natehez district, availed themselves of this extin∣guishment:
<PB N="45" REF="035588_0048_1005F7B065112E78"/>and as for obvious reasons, they could not have supposed it to have been made for the benefit of any other government than Florida, Georgia having then declared itself independent, it was notice to them that the British had extended the jurisdiction of that province. Their claim is founded on this extension; of which if they did not in this manner receive complete notice, they had such intimation at least, as not only made it incumbent on them to enquire fully into the busi∣ness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the case of Hoobs, and Norton.</NOTE>, but pointed out the source from whence all necessary information might be drawn.</P>
<P>But it may be asked, if the government was apprized of these circumstances, why did it omit to urge them in its negociations with Spain? The reason is obvious. To have urged them would have defeated its own claim. It could claim this country as part of the United States, on the ground only that it was not a part of Flo∣rida. To have shewn that it had become a part of that province before the treaty of peace, would have established the claim of Spain; for Florida was ceded to her previously to the defini∣tive treaty between Great-Britain, and us; and it is on the definitive treaty that our claim rested. It was the business of our government therefore to keep this matter out of view; and fortunately for us, it seems to have been unknown to the Spani∣ards. Certainly it was much wiser to retain this country, as part of the United States, even at the expence of giving it to Georgia, than to yield it to Spain. If our government chose to pursue that course, and by its conduct and assertions individu∣als have been induced, confiding in its authority, to regard Georgia as the owner of these lands and to purchase from her, with what justice could the United States now attempt to deprive them of the
<PB N="46" REF="035588_0049_1005F7B2D36A4E70"/>property? Is government, contrary to every rule of law, to take advantage of its own acts in order to injure others, and to punish them for having con∣fided in its solemn declarations?</P>
<P>But were not the purchasers themselves acquaint∣ed with this right, or at least bound to take notice of it? And in that case did they not purchase at their own risk? The answer to this also is obvious. Had the United States been acquiescent, had they remained silent and passive only, the purchasers might have been considered, perhaps, as taking at their own risk: but when Georgia openly claimed and exercised the right, and the United States not only made no objection but aided the claim by their positive declarations, the purchasers were bound to look no further. Even had the claim of the government been matter of record<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the case of Arnot v. Biscoe, 1. Veg. 96.</NOTE>, or had they been expressly informed of its exis∣tence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Case of Hobbs, v. Norton ante.</NOTE>, yet would their purchase have been valid under these circumstances of encouragement, by the government itself.</P>
<P>It seems clear therefore, that as the party selling not only claimed the right, but had the appear∣ance of possessing it, which appearance was con∣firmed by the acquiescence, and even the express declaration of the true owners, this sale, in the case of an individual, would be completely valid and binding in law.</P>
<P>But will the same rules apply to a government? This is the point next to be examined.</P>
<P>In the English law, from which most of our maxims of jurisprudence are derived, it is a re∣ceived principle that the king who represents the government, and in whom the public property is legally vested, can be made ameanable to no kind of process; that to him no fraud, no improprie∣ty,
<PB N="47" REF="035588_0050_1005F7B461BB7B98"/>no negligence even, can be imputed. Yet if he should do a wrongful act, as making an im∣proper grant, for instance, the court of Chancery would give redress to the party injured, and even set aside the grant, if necessary, on the ground that the king had been deceived. This proves two things; first that the acts of government are subject to the rules of law and justice, although the go∣vernment itself cannot be brought to answer in a Legal process: And secondly, that the inability of the government to do wrong is a mere fiction, which the judicial power explains a way in favour of justice, whenever it can. They will not say that the act was done thro' negligence or an improper intention, but through deception; yet if in fact wrongful, they will set it aside, whenever it is of such a nature as to be subjected to their controul.</P>
<P>This being the case even in England, whose monarchieal government is supposed to require a sacred inviolability in the chief Magistrate, the same maxims should obtain more readily and in greater extent among us, as being far more con∣genial to the nature and principles of our govern∣ment. Accordingly we find that the idea of sub∣jecting the acts of government to the rules of ju∣dicial dicision is perfectly familiar in our consti∣tutions. Our courts make no difficulty of declar∣ing Ligislative acts void, even those of the Union, where they are contrary to the Constitution. This is founded on the principle that the ligislatures in making such acts, have exceeded their autho∣rity. Why should not the acts of government in other instances also, be subjected to the rules of law and the maxims of justice? Why should not this salutary controul of the judicial power, be ex∣tended to all cases where the acts complained of
<PB N="48" REF="035588_0051_1005F7B7E1F54878"/>can be brought within its reach? There seems to exist, be good reason to the contrary. Our go∣vernment possesses land which it is in the practice of selling to individuals; and it appoints agents for that purpose, with proper powers and instruc∣tions. If after one of these agents had made a sale persuant to his powers, the government should attempt to reclaim the land or sell it again, would not the judicial power protect the title of the first purchaser? Would it not enquire into the validity of the second sale whenever it became the subject of litigation, and declare it void, even if made by an express law? There seems no doubt on this head. If then the judicial power would enforce the rules of law and justice as to one mode of disposing of property by the govern∣ment, why should it not equally enforce them as to other modes? And we know that a person may as effectually dispose of his Land by standing by, while another sells it, as by selling it himself.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there does not seem to be any reason why the same rules which have been esta∣blished on this subject respecting individuals should not equally apply to the acts of government. From whence it would result that the United States, having not only acquiesced in all the acts of ownership exercised by the State of Georgia over this Land, and in the ultimate sale of it, but also supported and given colour to the right of that State by express declarations in its favour, will be bound by the sale. This opinion however cannot be positively pronounced. The matter is attended by many difficulties; and the dicision, in some of its most important parts, rests not on authority, but on reasonings, the force of which must be judged of in the courts. There perhaps a very different view of the subject may may be entertained.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035588_0052_1005F7BA8CDA63D8"/>
The claims of the United States, which opened the first, and far the most extensive field of enqui∣ry, having been thus surveyed, the repealing act of Georgia now presents itself for consideration.</P>
<P>This act it is to be observed in the first place does not profess to <HI>repeal</HI> the act of January 7th 1795, but declares it void. The reasons for this mode of proceeding are obvious. The act of January 7th had produced its whole effect. The sales which it directed had been completely made, the money paid, and grants passed. It could not therefore have been at all affected by a repeal: for it is a well known principle that to repeal a law, far from undoing what has already been done under it, can only prevent its future operation. In or∣der to destroy these sales therefore—which was the object aimed at by the legislature—it was ne∣cessary to do something more than repeal the law it was necessary to declare it originally void.</P>
<P>A single observation, which presents itself here, might decide the question on this repealing law It is this; that the force, validity or meaning of a legislative act is purely a judicial question, and altogether beyond the province of the legislature It is the province of the legislative power to make laws, to give them their existence; but to ex∣pound and enforce them belongs to the judiciary. The judicial power is to declare what the law <HI>is;</HI> the legislative, what it <HI>shall be.</HI> The legislature therefore may repeal one of its own acts; that is, may declare that it shall not hereafter be law: but should it go further, and declare that it is void, that it is not now law, it steps beyond its powers; and its proceedings become null.</P>
<P>This is a fundamental principle of all our consti∣tutions, which declare that the judicial and legisla∣tive powers shall be distinct and separate. It results
<PB N="50" REF="035588_0053_1005F7BC1BF8FAF0"/>also from the very existence of a written constitu∣tion; which, by its necessary operation, prescribes limits to the legislative body, and confides the pro∣tection and maintainance of those limits to the ju∣dicial power. As well might the legislature try causes, or hear appeals, as attempt to expound, enforce, or declare void one of its own acts; ex∣cept so far as might relate to the <HI>future</HI> operation of such act. Its validity, so far as might relate to its former operation, to acts already done under its authority, is a question which the courts of jus∣tice alone not the legislature are competent to decide.</P>
<P>These sales moreover were contracts, made with the utmost solemnity, for a valuable consideration, and carried deliberately into complete execution. It is an invariable maxim of law and of natural justice, that one of the parties to a contract can∣not by his own act, exempt himself, from its obli∣gation. A contrary principle would break down all the ramparts of right, disolve the bonds of pro∣perty, and render good faith, to enforce the observ∣ance of which is the great object of civil institu∣tions, subservient to the partiality, the selfishness, and the unjust caprices of every individual. There is no reason why governments, more than private persons, should be exempt from the opera∣tion of this mixim; nor are they considered as ex∣empt by our constitution or our laws. The state of Georgia, being a party to this contract, could no more relieve itself from the obligation, by any act of its own, than an individual who had signed a bond could relieve himself from the necessity of pay∣ment there were sufficient grounds for relief in either case, the state or the individual must resort to the courts of justice, where it would be afforded: but the acts of the one and the other for relieving themselves would be equally and essentially negatory.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035588_0054_1005F7BE9EC895B0"/>
The act of Georgia therefore can have no legal effect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is satisfactory to find this opinion corroborated by that of a very emi∣nent Lawer in Newyork who was sometime ago consulted on this point— See Col Hamilton's opinion; apendix No 17.</NOTE> It can be regarded only as a declara∣tion stating the grounds on which that state con∣ceives itself intitled to relief from the contract in question. As such a declaration however, from so respectable a body as the legislature of a state, cannot fail to make a strong impression, it will be not improper to examine these grounds a little more minutely, in order that a better judgment may be formed about their sufficiency.</P>
<P>The sales are declared void by this act, on two grounds. First that the legislature had not con∣stitutional power to make them. Secondly that in passing the act for that purpose, it was influen∣ced by fraudulent and corrupt motives.</P>
<P>As to the first, it is not improper to repeat that it is purely an object of judicial enquiry. Had the state of Georgia, as it might have done, filed a bill in the supreme federal court against the purchasers, to set aside the sales, one object of enquiry in that court would have been whether they they were made by sufficient authority: and if it had found that they were not, they must have been set aside. But who ever heard till this act was passed, that the legislatures under our consti∣tutions have not power to sell the public proper∣ty, or give it away? This has always been consi∣dered as one of the most essential branches of le∣gislative authority. It has been exercised by every legislature in the Union; and by that of Georgia, in numerous instances. If the legislature has a right to dispose of the public lands, which cannot be deni∣ed, it may dispose of them in what quantities and
<PB N="52" REF="035588_0055_1005F7C04A7E7A48"/>on what conditions it thinks fit: for the right be∣ing unrestricted, so must be its exercise.</P>
<P>The second ground, the ground of fraud and corruption, was equally a subject of judicial inqui∣ry. There cannot be a doubt that if a legislative body in making a contract, has been imposed on, it will, equally with an individual, be intitled to relief; but, like an individual, it must seek this relief in a court of justice. In a bill filed in this case for setting aside the sales, the allegation of fraud would have been enquired into, and, if sup∣ported by proper proof, would no doubt have been a sufficient ground for relief. This course the state might have pursued. In this manner it might have obtained whatever remedy it is inti∣tled to in law and justice.</P>
<P>But what is the nature of the fraud complained of; and by what proof is the charge supported?</P>
<P>The act does not pretend that the legislature which made these sales was deceived, was imposed on; but that some individuals among them were corrupted. Do the circumstances alledged a∣mount to corruption? Can the motives of indivi∣dual members be enquired into, in order to inva∣lidate the acts of a legislative body?</P>
<P>It is alledged by the act "That a majority of those members of the legislature who voted in favour of the sales, were engaged in the purchase." There are various other vague and general charges, but this is the only specific fact alledged. It is not even pretended that a majority of the legislature was concerned, but only "A majority of those who voted for the sales." Admitting this to be true, was it an act of corruption? It might be con∣sidered perhaps as an impropriety; but on what ground can it be stigmatized as corrupt? It is not stated that those persons were bribed; that
<PB N="53" REF="035588_0056_1005F7C3C87B10F8"/>they were to receive money for their votes, or even to have part of the land without paying for it; but simply that they were concerned in the purchase. But are there no other than corrupt motives which could induce a member to vote for a sale of public property, in which he himself was concerned? Might he not regard the sale, espe∣cially as it was of lands, the benefit of which to the public depends on their being cultivated, as advantageous to the state as well as to the purcha∣sers? Might it not in fact be so? It is a rule of law that if an act can be fairly accounted for on proper motives, corrupt ones shall not be presumed.</P>
<P>But it is believed that a legislative act can never be invalidated on account of the motives from which it may have been agreed to by individual members: that those motives can never be brought into question. Could such enquiries be instituted where could be the end of them? By what mode of proof should they be conducted? What a door would be opened to fraud and uncertainty of every kind! The very foundations of legislative authori∣ty would be shaken; and all its acts might be nul∣lified by the fraud or the artifices of individuals. If the legislature, considered as an individual, have been imposed on, like an individual it may be re∣lieved: if it have exceeded the bounds of its au∣thority, its acts are null; but the motives of its members can never be questioned without striking at the root of law, and introducing scenes of con∣fusion a thousand times more intolerable, then any evils which it could intended to remedy.</P>
<P>The proofs of this corruption, which come next to be considered, are stated by the act under four heads: affidavits; presentments of grand juries; petitions and remonstrances; and the circumstance
<PB N="54" REF="035588_0057_1005F7C71112D980"/>of a larger sum having been rejected for the same property.</P>
<P>It is well known that the presentments of a grand jury are never admitted as evidence in courts of justice. Even the testimony on which they are founded is, for the most part, of such a nature that it could not be received there. They serve as the foundations of enquiry, but never as proof of a fact. Such of the presentments in question as have been seen, even if they were admitted as evi∣dence, would prove nothing; for they either de∣nounce the sales in general terms, as injurious to the public and improperly obtained, or merely state the fact of some members having been con∣cerned, or requested to be so, in the purchase.</P>
<P>Still less can remonstrances and petitions be re∣lied on in the decision of legal rights. The means by which they are frequently obtained, and the slight grounds whereon they sometimes rest, are too well known to need any observations.</P>
<P>As to the rejection of a larger offer, it may have been a very wise step. The security may have been deemed insufficient. The offer may have been considered as delusive. It is not known by the counsel much less insinuated, that this was the case; but it is sufficient that it may have been so considered by the legislature, and therefore may have furnished them with a very upright tho' perhaps ill-judged motive, for their rejection. The fact is that the offer was made by only four or five individuals; while the companies who purchased consisted of a very considerable num∣ber. The latter also paid a large sum in advance, which it is not understood that the former proposed. Under these circumstances, surely it is not necessa∣ry to resort to corrupt motives for the preference.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035588_0058_1005F7C89D633180"/>
On the subject of the affidavits, all of which have been carefully examined, several important observations occur.</P>
<P>In the first place they were ex parte; taken in private, before a committee of the house of repre∣sentatives; the witnesses not confronted with those persons against whom their testimony was to ope∣rate; not subjected to cross-examination. The admission of testimony taken in this manner is no less contradictory to the practice of every court known to the American constitutions, than to the plain principles of natural justice. Had those wit∣nesses been cross-examined, it is impossible to tell what circumstances might have appeared to give a different complexion to the whole case. In testi∣mony too not delivered from the mouth of the witness himself, but taken in writing and taken by one side only, it is natural to presume that what∣ever makes in favour of that side will be more par∣ticularly dwelt on, and more strongly expressed; while such parts as seem opposed to it are apt to be either omitted or stated imperfectly. This arises from the natural imperfection of the human mind, from the effect of our passions on our understand∣ing and our conduct. Hence has resulted a rule which is invariably observed in all our courts; that testimony is never admitted, unless both par∣ties have had an opportunity of joining in the ex∣amination.</P>
<P>In the case of these affidavits it is affirmed that the examining committee refused to take down material parts of the testimony actually given by the witnesses, and tending to exculpate the mem∣bers accused of corruption.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Affidavits of Flourney v. Clayton.</NOTE> In the uncertainty that there is, whether this fact may not have been
<PB N="56" REF="035588_0059_1005F7CB1C810AF8"/>misunderstood, the respect due to such a body as the committee of a legislative assembly represses those remarks to which, of true, it must give rise.</P>
<P>But the evidence itself, if properly taken, is li∣able to many strong objections.</P>
<P>In some instances it is contradictory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Affidavits of James Tyroll, and Russel Jones.</NOTE> and con∣jectural<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De. and Philip Clayton and John Thomas.</NOTE>? It depends in a great degree on hear∣say<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Affidavids throughout</NOTE>, which the best known rules of law, and the dictates of common justice, concur in rejecting. It consists almost wholly of the confessions of members made, not to the legislature or the com∣mittee, but to the witnesses, about the impropriety of their own conduct; and finally the whole scope of it is to prove that certain members, who voted for the law, were actuated by corrupt motives; a point which it has been shewn, can never be en∣quired into for the purpose of invalidating a le∣gislative act.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark also that the members who appear by these affidavits to have been con∣cerned in the contract, were to pay their portion of the purchase money.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See affidavits of van Allen, Rains, and Lucas.</NOTE> There is indeed one in∣stance of the contrary; but it is proved by the hearsay confession, not of the member himself, but of a person who declared himself to be one of the purchasers<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Do. of James M. Niel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This testimony therefore, whether its substance be regarded or the manner of its being taken, ap∣pears equally defective.</P>
<P>But if it were less so, if the proofs of corrup∣tion in the legislature were not only admissible but strong, they would be greatly counter balanced by the conduct of the governor. He has never
<PB N="57" REF="035588_0060_1005F7CE816573D0"/>been accused, or even suspected, of corruption. It can hardly be conceived, that, pure himself, he would have aided the corruption of others; would have sanctioned an act which he knew to have originated in motives so flagitious. Had these practices existed, it is next to impossible that they should have escaped his knowledge; for he was not only on the spot, and well acquainted with all the actors in this business, but lived in the closest connection and intimacy with some of its warmest opposers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Leading member of the Senate, who was the governor's son-in-law and lived in his house was one of the most strenuous in opposition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It cannot be pretended that the governor coun∣tenanced this act through deference of the Legis∣lature; for the same motive would have led him to concur in the first bill which however was rejected. He must therefore have assented to the second, be∣cause he found it free from those objections which had operated against the first; and considered it as conducive to the public good. Why may not the legislature be concieved to have acted from the same motives? Must corruption be resorted to in order to find a reason for their doing an act, which the governor, equally enlightened with them, was led to by a sense of duty?</P>
<P>Thus it seems clear that the legislature of Geor∣gia was wholly incompetent to set aside this act, even had there been sufficient grounds; because this is a judicial, not a legislative function, and because the sale was a contract to which the state itself was a party: that had the legislature been competent, the evidence on which it proceeded was not only inconclusive, but altogether inadmissible: And that, since to dispose of the public land is one of the most undeniable powers of the legislature, and
<PB N="58" REF="035588_0061_1005F7D11992D060"/>the motives of members, even if corrupt, which in this case is far from being established, cannot be alledged against the validity of a legislative act, there was no ground, either of unconstitu∣tionality or corruption, upon which, even in a competent tribunal, this act could have been de∣clared void.</P>
<P>It is proper to add that even if this contract could be set aside, an essential condition of doing so must be the repayment of the purchase money. It is one of the most obvious improprieties in the re∣pealing act, that it attempts to destroy the purchase without making the least provision, or even stipu∣lation, for their repayment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note page 31.</NOTE>. If, as it has been asserted, the legislature which passed the repealing act made an appropriation of part of this money, it was a complete confirmation, as far as depend∣ed on them, of the contract which they avowed an intention of annulling<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the case of Cole v. Gibbons. P. W.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this view of the two points submitted, taken under all those aspects which were declared important, the undersigned counsel is led to the following conclusion, which he certifies as his opi∣nion: 1. That the United States never had a right to any part of the lands in question, above a line drawn due east from the mouth of the Ya∣zoo: 2. That, under circumstances of the case, they will probably be considered, in the courts of equity, as bound by the sales which have been made by the state of Georgia below that line: And 3. That the title of the purchasers, either above or below, can in no degree be affected by the repealing act of that State.</P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>GEORGE R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>Whereas we have taken into our royal consideration the extensive and valuable acquisitions in America, se∣cured to our crown by the late difinitive treaty of peace concluded at Paris the 10th day of February last; and being desirous that all our loving subjects, as well of our kingdoms as of our colonies in America, may avail them∣selves, with all convenient speed, of the great benefits and advantages which must accrue therefrom to their com∣merce, manufactures, and navigation; we have thought
<PB N="61" REF="035588_0064_1005F7D8BA887B58"/>fit with the advice of our privy council, to issue this royal proclamation, hereby to publish and declare to all our loving subjects, that we have, with the advice of our said privy council, granted our letters patent under our great seal of Great-Britain, to erect within the countries and islands, ceded and confirmed to us by the said treaty, four distinct and separate governments, stiled and called by the names of Quebec, East Florida, and West Florida, and Grenada, and limited and bounded as follows, viz.</P>
<P>First the government of Quebec, bounded on the La∣brador coast by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn from the head of that river, through the lake St. John, to the south end of the lake Nipissim; from whence the said line, crossing the river St. Lawrence and the lake Champlain in 45 degrees of north latitude, passes along the highlands, which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the sea; and also along the north coast of the Bay des Chaleurs, and the coast of the Gulph of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres, and from thence crossing the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by the west end of the island of Anticosti, terminates at the aforesaid river St. John.</P>
<P>Secondly, The government of East Florida, bounded to the westward by the Gulph of Mexico and the Apala∣chicola river; to the northward, by a line drawn from that part of the said river where the Chatahouchee and Flint rivers meet, to the source of St. Mary's river, and by the course of the said river to the Atlantic Ocean, and to the east and south by the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulph of Florida, including all islands within six leagues of the sea coast.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the government of West Florida, bounded to the southward by the Gulph of Mexico, including all is∣lands within six leagues of the coast from the river Apala∣chicola to lake Pontchartrain; to the westward by the said lake, the lake Maurepas, and the river Mississippi; to the northward, by a line drawn due east from that part of the river Mississippi which lies in thirty-one degrees north la∣titude, to the river Apalachicola, or Catahouchee; and to the eastward by the said river.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The government of Grenada, comprehend∣ing the island of that name, together with the Grena∣dines,
<PB N="62" REF="035588_0065_1005F7DB1CB1EE98"/>and the islahds of Dominico, St. Vincent, and Tobago.</P>
<P>And to the end that the open and free fishery of our subjects may be extended to, and carried on upon the coast of Labrador and the adjacent islands, we have thought fit, with the advice of our said privy council, to put all that coast from the river St. John's to Hudson's Streights, to∣gether with the islands of Anticosti and Madelaine, and all other smaller islands lying upon the said coast, under the care and inspection of our governor of Newfound∣land.</P>
<P>We have also, with the advice of our privy council, thought fit to annex the islands of St. John, and Cape Bre∣ton, or Isle Royale, with the lesser islands adjacent there∣to to our government of Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>We have also, with the advice of our privy council aforesaid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's.</P>
<P>And whereas it will greatly contribute to the speedy settling our said new governments, that our loving sub∣jects should be informed of our paternal care for the secu∣rity of the liberties and properties of those who are, and shall become inhabitants thereof; we have thought fit to publish and declare, by this our proclamation, that we have, in the letters patent under our great seal of Great-Britain, by which the said governments are constituted, given express power and direction to our governors of our said colonies respectively, that so soon as the state and cir∣cumstances of the said colonies will admit thereof, they shall, with the advice and consent of the members of our council, summon and call general assemblies within the said governments respectively, in such manner and form as is used and directed in those colonies and provinces in America, which are under our immediate government; and we have also given power to the said governors, with the consent of our said councils, and the representatives of people, so to be summoned as aforesaid, to make, consti∣tute, and ordain laws, statutes, and ordinances for the public peace, welfare, and good government of our said colonies, and of the people and inhabitants thereof, as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England, and under such regulations and restrictions as are used in other colonies; and in the mean time time, and until such as∣semblies
<PB N="63" REF="035588_0066_1005F7DCA938F698"/>can be called as aforesaid, all persons inhabiting in, or resorting to our said colonies may confide in our royal protection for the enjoyment of the benefit of the laws of our realm of England; for which purpose we have given power under our great seal to the governors of our sail colonies respectively, to erect and constitute, with the advice of our said councils respectively, courts of judi∣cature and public justice within our said colonies, for the hearing and determining all causes, as well criminal as ci∣vil, according to law and equity, and as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of England, with liberty to all per∣sons who may think themselves aggrieved by the sentence of such courts, in all civil cases, to appeal, under the usual limitations and restrictions, to us in our privy council.</P>
<P>We have also thought fit with the advice of our privy council as aforesaid, to give unto the governors and coun∣cils of our said three new colonies upon the continent; full power and authority to settle and agree with the inha∣bitants of our said new colonies, or to any other persons who shall resort thereto, for such lands, tenements, and hereditaments, as are now, or hereafter shall be, in our power to dispose of, and them to grant to any such person or persons, upon such terms, and under such moderate quit-rents, services and acknowledgments, as have been appointed and settled in other colonies, and under such other conditions as shall appear to us to be necessary and expedient for the advantage of the grantees, and the im∣provement and settlement of our said colonies.</P>
<P>And whereas we are desirous, upon-all occasions, to testify our royal sense and approbation of the conduct and bravery of the officers and soldiers of our armies, and to reward the same, we do hereby command and impower our governors of our said three new colonies, and other our governors of our several provinces on the continent of North America, to grant without see or reward, to such reduced officers as have served in North America during the late war, and are actually residing there, and shall personally apply for the same, the following quantities of land, subject, at the expiration of ten years, to the same quit-rents as other land are subject to, in the province within which they are granted, as also subject to the same conditions of cultivation and improvements, viz.</P>

<ITEM>To every non-commission officer, 200 acres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>To every private man, 50 acres.</ITEM>

<P>We do likewise authorise and require the governors and commanders in chief of all our said colonies upon the continent of North America, to grant the like quantities of land, and upon the same conditions, to such reduced officers of our navy of like rank, as served on board our ships of war in North America, at the times of the re∣duction of Louisburg and Quebec, in the late war, and who shall personally apply to our respective governors for such grants.</P>
<P>And whereas it just and reasonable, and essential to our interest, and the security or our colonies, that the several nations or tribes of Indians, with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection, should not be molest∣ed or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our do∣minions and territories as, not having been ceded to, or purchased by us, are reserved to them, or any of them, as their hunting grounds; we do therefore, with the advice of our privy council, declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, that no governor or commander in chief, in any of our colonies of Quebec, East Florida, or West Florida, do presume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of survey, or pass any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their respective governments, as discribed by their commissions; as also that no governor or commander in chief of our other colonies or plantations in America, do presume for the present, and until our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents for any lands beyond the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the west or north west; or upon any lands whatever, which not having been ceded to, or purchased by us, as aforesaid, are reserv∣ed to the said Indians, or any of them.</P>
<P>And we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty, protection and dominion for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included with∣in the limits of our said three new governments or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson's Bay company; as also all the land and territories lying to the
<PB N="65" REF="035588_0068_1005F7E1D5955078"/>westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchasers or settlements whatever, or taking possession of any of the lands above-reserved, without our especial leave and licence for that purpose first obtained.</P>
<P>And we do further strictly enjoin and require all per∣sons whatever, who have either wilfully or inadvertent∣ly seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described, or upon any other lands, which not having been ceded to, or purchased by us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements.</P>
<P>And whereas great frauds and abuses have been com∣mitted in the purchasing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of our interests, and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians; in order, therefore, to prevent such interruption for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, we do, with the advice of our privy council, strictly enjoin and equire that no private person do presume to make any purchace from the said Indians, of any lands reserved to the said Indians, within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement; but that if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, at some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that purpose by the governor or commander in chief of our colony respectively within which they shall lie: and in case they shall lie within the limits of any proprietaries, conformable to such directions and instructions as we or they shill think proper to give for that purpose: and we do, by the advice of our privy council, declare and enjoin, that the trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all our subjects what∣ever, provided that every person who may incline to trade with the said Indians, do take out a licence for carrying on such trade, from the governor or commander in chief of any of our colonies respectively, where such person shall reside, and also give security to observe such regulations as we shall at any time think fit, by our selves or commissa∣ries, to be appointed for this purpose, to direct and appoint
<PB N="66" REF="035588_0069_1005EBE96455B648"/>for the benefit of the said trade: and we do hereby autho∣rise, enjoin, and require the governors and commanders in chief of all our colonies respectively, as well those under our immediate government, as those under the govern∣ment and direction of proprietaries, to grant such licences without see or reward. taking especial care to insert therein a condition that such licence shall be void, and the securi∣ty forfeited, in case the person to whom the same is granted, shall refuse or neglect to observe such regulation as we shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And we do further expressly enjoin and require all officers whatever, as well military as those employed in the management and direction of Indians affairs within the territories reserved, as aforesaid, for the use of the said Indians' to seize and apprehend all persons whatever, who standing charged with treasons, misprisions of treason, mur∣ders, or other felonies or misdemeanours, shall fly from justice and take refuge in the said territory, and to send them under a proper guard to the colony where the crime was committed of which they shall stand accused, in or∣der to take their trial for the same,</P>

<P>BY your majesty's royal proclamation of the 7th of October last, and your majesty's commission to your go∣vernor of West Florida, it is declared that the said pro∣vince shall be bounded to the north by a line drawn due east from that part of the river Mississippi which lies in 31 degrees north latitude, to the river Apalachicola; but it is our duty to represent to your majesty that we are in∣formed by your majesty's governor, that it appears from ob∣servations and surveys made since the said province has been in your majesty's possession, that there are not only very considerable settlements upon the east bank of the Mississippi above that line, but also that the town and set∣tlement of Mobile itself is some miles to the north of it,
<PB N="67" REF="035588_0070_1005F7E5445CBEB8"/>and therefore we humbly beg leave to propose that an in∣strment may pass under the great seal (in like manner as was directed in the case of the extension of the south boundary of Georgia) declaring that the province of West Florida shall be bounded to the north by a line drawn from the mouth of the river Yasous, where it unites with the Mississippi due east to the river Apalachicola, by which we humbly conceive every material settlement depending up∣on West Florida will be comprehended within the limits of that government.</P>

<HEAD><HI>No. VII.</HI> An Ordinance of the general assembly of the State of South-Carolina, entitled, "An Ordinance for ratifying and confirming a convention between the States of South-Carolina and Georgia, &amp;c. passed February <HI>29th, 1788,</HI> from which it appears, that the State of South-Carolina has ceded to Georgia, all right and claim to the territory to be granted to the company, viz.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the state of South-Carolina did hereto∣fore present a petition to the Uniten States in congress assembled, and did therein set forth, that a difference had arisen and subsisted between the state of South-Caro∣lina and Georgia, concerning boundaries, the said states claiming respectively the same territories, and that the case and claim of the state of South-Carolina was as fol∣lows, that is to say, "Charles the II. king of Great-Bri∣tain, by charter, dated the 24th day of March, in the 16th year of his reign, granted to eight persons therein named as lord proprietors thereof, all the lands lying and being within his dominions of America, between thirty-one and thirty-six degrees of north latitude, in a direct west line to the South-Seas, stiling the lands so described, the province of Carolina: that on the 30th day of June, in the 17th year of his reign, the said king granted to the said lords a second charter, enlarging the bounds of Caro∣lina, viz. from twenty-nine degrees of north latitude to thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, and from those points on the sea coast west in a direct line in the South-Seas: that seven of the said proprietors of Carolina sold and sur∣rendered to George the IId. late king of Great Britain, all their title and interest in the said province, and the share of the remaining proprietor was separated from the king's, and allotted to him in the north part of North-Carolina: that Carolina was afterwards divided into two provinces called North and South-Carolina; that by a charter dated the 9th of June, 1732, George the IId. king of Great-Britain, granted to certain persons therein named, all the lands lying between the rivers Savannah and Altamaha, and between lines to be drawn from the
<PB N="71" REF="035588_0074_1005F7EF1218C448"/>heads of those rivers respectively to the South Sea, and stiled the said colony Georgia: that by the treaty of peace concluded at Paris, on the 10th day of February, 1763, the river Mississippi was declared to be the western boun∣dary of the North American colonies: that the governor of South-Carolina, in the year 1762, conceiving that the lands to the south of the Altamaha still belonged to South-Carolina, granted several tracts of the said land: that the government of Georgia complained to the king of Great-Britain respecting those grants, as being for land within its limits, and thereupon his majesty, by proclamation dated the 7th day of October, 1793, annexed to Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary, the validity of the grants passed by the governor of South-Carolina as aforesaid, remaining however ac∣knowledged and uncontested, and the grantees of the said land or their representatives still holding it as their legal estate: that South-Carolina claims the land lying be∣tween the North-Carolina line and a line to run due west from the mouth of Tugoloo river to the Mississippi, be∣cause as the said state contends the river Savannah loses that name at the confluence of Tugoloo and Keowee rivers, consequently that spot is the head of Savannah river, the state of Georgia on the other hand contends, that the source of Keowee river is to be considered as the head of Savannah river: that the state of South-Carolina also claims all the lands lying between a line to be drawn from the head of the river St. Mary, the head of Altamaha, the Mississippi, and Florida, being, as the said state con∣tends, within the limits of its charter, and not annexed to Georgia by the said proclamation of 1763: the state of Georgia on the other hand contends that the tract of country last mentioned is a part of that state:" the state of South-Carolina did therefore by their said petition pray for an hearing and determination of the difference and dispute subsisting as aforesaid between the said state and Georgia, agreeable to the articles of confederation and perpetual union between the United States of America: <HI>And whereas</HI> the state of Georgia were duly notifyed of the said petition, and did by their lawful agents appear in order to establish their right to the premises in manner directed by the said articles of confederation, and proceed∣ings were thereon had in congress in order to the appoint∣ment
<PB N="72" REF="035588_0075_1005F7F09DDD37C8"/>of judges to constitute a court for hearing and deter∣mining the said matter in question: <HI>And whereas</HI> it ap∣peared to be the sincere wish and desire of the said states of South-Carolina and Georgia, that all and singular the differences and claims subsisting between the said states relative to boundary, should be amicably adjusted and compromised: <HI>And whereas</HI> the legislature of the state of South-Carolina did elect Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Andrew Pickens and Pierce Butler, Esqrs commission∣ers, and did invest them or a majority of them with full and absolute power and authority in behalf of that state to to settle and compromise all and singular the differences, controversies, disputes and claims which subsist between the said state and the state of Georgia relative to bounda∣ry, and to establish and permanently six a boundary be∣tween the two states; And the said state of South-Caro∣lina did declare, that it would at all times thereafter ratify and confirm all and whatsoever the said commissioners or a majority of them should do in and touching the premises, and that the same should be forever binding on the said state of South-Carolina: <HI>And whereas</HI> the legislature of the state of Georgia did appoint John Huston, John Ha∣bersham and Lachlan M'Intosh, Esqr's, commissioners, and did invest them with full and absolute power and au∣thority in behalf of that state to settle and compromise all and singular the differencies, controversies, disputes and claims which subsist between the said state and the state of South-Carolina relative to boundary, and to establish and permanently six a boundary between the two states; and the state of Georgia, did also declare, that it would at all times thereafter ratify and confirm all and whatsoever the said lastmentioned commissioners or a majority of them should do in and touching the premises, and that the same should be forever binding on the said state of Georgia: <HI>And whereas</HI> the said Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, An∣drew Pickens, Pierce Butler, John Habersham, and Lachlan M'Intosh, Esqrs. commissioners on the part of the states of South-Carolina, and Georgia respectively, did by mutual consent assemble at the town of Beaufort, in the state of South-Carolina, on the 24th day of April, 1787, in order to the execution of their respective trusts, and did reciprocally exchange and consider their full pow∣ers, and did declare the same legal and forever binding on

<P><HI>Art.</HI> II The navigation of the river Savannah at and from the bar, and mouth along the north-east side of Cockspur island, and up the direct course of the main northern channel along the northern side of Hutchinson's island opposite the town of Savannah to the upper end of the said island, and from thence up the bed or principal stream of the said river to the confluence up the channel of the most northern stream of Tugoloo river to its source, and back again by the same channel to the Atlantic ocean, is hereby declared to be henceforth equally free to the citizens of both states, and exempt from all duties, tolls, hindrance, interruption or molestation whatsoever, at∣tempted to be enforced by one state on the citizens of the other; and all the rest of the river Savannah to the south∣ward of the foregoing discription, is acknowledged to be the exclusive right of the state of Georgia.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> III. The state of South-Carolina shall not here∣after claim any lands to the <HI>castward, southward, south∣westward, or west</HI> of the boundary <HI>above established,</HI> but hereby <HI>relinquishes and cedes</HI> to the state of Georgia <HI>all the right, title and claim</HI> which the state of South-Carolina
<PB N="74" REF="035588_0077_1005F7F494896A70"/>hath to the government, sovereignty and jurisdiction, in and over the same, and also the <HI>right and pre-emption of the soil</HI> from the native Indians, and all other the <HI>estate, property and claim</HI> which the state of South-Carolina hath in or to thesaid lands.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> IV. The state of Georgia shall not hereafter claim any lands to the northward and north-eastward of the boundary above established, but here relinquishes and codes to the state of South-Carolina all the right, title and claim which the said state of Georgia hath to the govern∣ment, sovereignty and jurisdiction in and over the same, and also the right of pre-emption of the soil from the na∣tive Indians, and all other the estate, property and claim which the state of Georgia hath in or to the said lands.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> V. The lands heretofore granted by either of the said states between the forks of Tugoloo and Keowee, shall be the private property of the first grantees and their respective heirs and assigns; and the grantees of any of the lands under the state of Georgia shall within twelve months from the date hereof cause such grants or authentic copies thereof, ratified under the seal of the state of Georgia to be deposited in the office of the secretary of state, of South-Carolina, to the end that the same may be recorded there, and after the same shall have been so recorded, the grantees shall be entitled to receive again from the said se∣eretary their respective grants to the copies thereof, whichsoever may have been so deposited, without any charge or fees of office whatsoever, and every grant, of which the copy certified as abovementioned, shall not be deposited, shall be adjudged void.</P>

<P>IN this stage of their government the several Bounda∣ries were fixt, and particularly the southern Boundary of Georgia, the one now brought into question by Spain.

<PB N="78" REF="035588_0081_1005F7FFC10250E8"/>claim to possessions <HI>within the state of Georgia,</HI> founded on her having rescued them by force from the British du∣ring late war. The following view of that subject seems to admit of no reply.</P>
<P>The several states now composing the United States of America, were, from their first establishment, separate and distinct societies dependent on no other society of men whatever.

<HEAD><HI>No. XIII. AUGUSTA, January 28.</HI> To the President and Fellow-Citizens of the Senate.</HEAD>
<P>The Senate and house of Representatives are now con∣stitutionally convened for legislative deliberations, and at
<PB N="92" REF="035588_0095_1005F822A61BF370"/>a time too when the minds of our fellow-Citizens are, and have been for some time past more engaged in discussing the conduct of the last legislature on the subject of the act for disposing of part of our Western Territory to certain companies, than perhaps has ever been experienced since this State assumed rank with her sister States—it will, no doubt be amongst the most important matters that may engross your attention to enquire on what ground this act was founded, and if a constitutional and legal remedy can applied to calm the minds of our fellow citizens on this interesting subject: in my opinion it requires and I flat∣ter myself will receive your most serious delibiration, whe∣ther a law can be constitutionally made to repeal another that has been fully carried into effect, as the one now in question, the companies having paid into the treasury the whole of the purchase money, and cancelled their mort∣gages; and whether, if repealed the remedy may not be even worse than the disease. But if a law can be devised that will constitutionally repeal the one referred to, and guard against future murmurs and well grounded com∣plaints against the repeal, I have no doubt but the man you may honour with the appointment of the chief Magistrate, will readily deem it a duty cheerfully to coperate.</P>
<P>It is a matter much to be regretted (considering the un∣favourable light the act for disposing of our Western Ter∣ritory has been viewed in) that the spirit of party resent∣ment and personal reflections should have ran so high in many instances; the public mind has been inflamed by un∣fair representations, and our newspapers have teemed with personal abuse and invective—this I remark from having experienced the public slander; endeavours have been made to calumniate my character by false reports, such as that the motives which induced me to give my assent to the second act, proceeded from private interest, regardless of the sacred duty I owed to the station I filled, and the rights, and interests, of my fellow-citizens—conscious of the purity of my intentions, and supported by the Justice and integrity of my actions, I have treated with silent contempt those base and malicious reports, and I now defy the blackest and the most persevering malice aided by disappointed avarice, to produce one single evidence of my ever having been interested in the sale to the a∣mount of one single farthing: but whilst I treated with
<PB N="93" REF="035588_0096_1005F8246ECC6860"/>neglect those reports so injurious to my character I feel it a respect due to you and a duty I owe to my reputa∣tion to give you a candid and fair statement of the mo∣tives which actuated me on a subject which has so much disturbed the citizens of Georgia. On the 25th day of De∣cember, 1794, an act for disposing of part of our West∣ern Territory to four companies, was presented to me for my concurrence; after the most mature reflection my judgment was capable of, I thought it my duty to refuse my assent, and assigned my reasons, which I flattered my∣self would have postponed any further legislative proceed∣ings in the law, until the next meeting of the house: but in that I was mistaken. The first idea that occurred to some of the members when the bill was returned with re∣marks, was that I should be impeached for an unconstitution∣al act—yet the more cool reflection of the house terminated in appointing a committee to confer with me on my ob∣jections and to know if it was in the power of the legis∣lature to frame a bill for the sale of the land which would meet my concurrence. On the conference I was led to believe that the committee was convinced, my reasons for rejecting the law did not proceed from "Executive ar∣rogance, or from a wish to bring into action a power heretofore dormant in our proceedings, or from a propen∣sity in me to do an act of so great responsibility; but from a conviction that it would tend to the real interest of the State—the reflecting mind will easily perceive how much the responsibility would be enhanced by rejecting a bill that the legislature might pass for the sale of the lands; after being in possession of my remarks, even sup∣posing it to be similar to the first: but when it appears that three of the most important objections I had made to the first law were removed, I think there is no man of cool dispassionate reflection that would have refused his assent to it for any reasons short of a clear proof of corruption in its passage through the legislature, <HI>and no such infor∣mation ever came to my knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>After all the popular clamour the law has occasioned, I should depart from my usual candour to say I have e∣ver blamed myself either for an error of the head or a corruption of the heart, and on a similar occasion should feel myself perfectly justified in pursuing a similar con∣duct: Much has been said about unascertained millions
<PB N="94" REF="035588_0097_1005F82884B9CEF0"/>of acres being sold and that more than fifty millions of a∣cres are disposed to the companies by that act: after having thought it my duty to act on the second bill. I ordered the Surveyor General to furnish me with as accurate a map of the country contemplated to be sold, as any documents he had or could procure would afford—this was done, and is now on the file of the Executive, from which it will ap∣pear there was no more than twenty-nine million 400,000 acres in the whole agregate the first law had in view, and one fourth of that quantity is now reserved to the State and subject to her disposition. This is a true state of facts, so far as they have come to my knowledge, and if it may afford you any useful hints in your deliberations, it will give me pleasure.</P>
<P>The sum of 500,000 dollars has been paid into your Treasury in terms of the act, 50,000 of which has been realized in six per cent stock of the United States, the in∣terest arising therefrom since the purchase, amounting to 2201 dollars 29 cents has been paid into your Treasury as also the interest arising from the ballance due to this State on the final settlement with the United States, a∣mounting to 689 dollars 58 cents, and the Treasurer's re∣ceipts for the original certificates, standing on the books of the loan office of the United States, are filed in the office of the cheque or the Treasury—the sum of 30,000 dol∣lars stand appropriated for extinguishing the Indian claims to the land between the Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers, and 20,000 dollars have been applied to paying the members of the assembly, the members of the convention, and other creditors of the state; 400,000 dollars remain now in your Treasury subject to the appropriation of the present Legislature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>No. XIV. A BILL</HI> Declaring null and void a certain usurped act passed by the last legislature of this state, at Augusta, the seventh day of January, one thousand seven hundred and nine∣ty-five, under the pretended title of "An act supple∣mentary to an act entitled, an act for appropriating a part of the unlocated Territory of this state, for the payment of the late state troops, and for other purposes therein mentioned; declaring the right of this state to the unappropriated territory thereof, for the protection of the frontiers, and for other purposes:" And for ex∣punging from the Face of the public records the said u∣surped act and declaring the right of this state to all lands laying within the boundaries therein mentioned.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="bill">
<P>WHEREAS the free citizens of this state, or in other words the community thereof, are essentially the source of the sovereignty of the state, and no individual or body of men can be entitled to, or vested with any authority which is not expressly derived from that source, and the exercise or assumption of powers not so derived, become of themselves oppression and usurpation; which it is the right and duty of the people or their representatives to resist, and to restore the rights of the community so usur∣ped and infringed,</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS, the will or constitution of the good people of this state is the only existing legal authori∣ty derived from the essential source of sovereignty, and is the only foundation of the legislative power or govern∣ment thereof, and so far as that will or constitution ex∣pressly warrants, the legislature may go, but no further; and all constructive powers not necessarily deduced from that expressed will, are violations of that essential source of sovereignty, and the rights of the citizens, and are therefore of no binding force or effect on the state, or the good people thereof, but null and void.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the last legislature of this state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confining itself to the powers with which that body was constitutionally invested, did usurp a power to pass
<PB N="96" REF="035588_0099_1005F82C7A62B760"/>an act on the seventh day of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, entitled "An act suplementary to an act entitled, an act for appropriating a part of the unlocated territory of this state, for the payment of the late state troops and for other purposes therein mentioned, de∣claring the right of the state to the unappropriated terri∣tory thereof, for the protection and support of the fron∣tiers, and for other purposes;" by which an enormous tract of unascertained millions of acres of the vacant ter∣ritory of this state, was attempted to be disposed of to a few individuals, in fee simple, and the same is not only un∣founded as being without express constitutional authority, but is repugnant to that authority, as well as to the prin∣ciples and form of the government, the good citizens of this state have chosen for their rule, which is democra∣tical, or a government founded on equality of rights; and and which is totally opposed to all proprietary grants, or monopolies, in favour of a few, which tend to build up that destructive aristocracy, in the new, which is tumbling in the old world; and which, if permitted, must end in the annihilation of democracy and equal rights; those rights and principles of that government which our vir∣tuous forefathers fought for, and established with their blood.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the fourth section of the fourth article of the constitution of the United States declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a republican government," which could never have been intended to be a republican aristocracy, and which such extravagant grants tend to establish, the constitution of the United States expressly acknowledging a republi∣can democracy, or the foundation of the people: it re∣ceiving all it force and power from their hands as their gist, which is manifest from its context, "We the people of the United States."</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS as before mentioned the said usur∣ped act is repugnant to the constitutional authority, in as much as that by the sixteenth section of the first article of the constitution of this state it is declared, "That the ge∣neral assembly shall have power to make all laws and or∣dinances which they shall deem necessary and proper for the good of the state, which shall not be repugnant to this constitution." And the said usurped act is opposed to the
<PB N="97" REF="035588_0100_1005F82ED3FDA918"/>good of the state, and it is selfevident that the legislature which assumed the power did not deem it for the good of the state:</P>
<P N="1">1st. Because self-preservation or the protecting itself is the greatest good or first duty of every government and as has been shewn, immense monopolies of Land by a few individuals under the sanction of the government is oppo∣sed to the principles of democracy, or the fundamental laws of the citizens of this state have chosen for their rule, which so far from being for the good or selfpreservation of the democratical, or equal government, is most mani∣festly for its destruction and injury.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Because the expression "good of the state" embra∣ces the good of the citizens composing the state, and the good of the citizens consists in the peaceable pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of all rights natural, or ac∣quired, not expressly delegated for the purposes of go∣vernment; and a sale of such an enormous tract to a few speculators, which was and is the common right of all the good citizens of this state, is contrary to those rights, and therefore to their manifest injury, and of course to the in∣jury of the state.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Because even supposing constitutional authority to have been vested in the legislature for the purpose of such disposal, the legislature was not vested with power to transfer the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the state over the territory attempted to be disposed of, which it has done by opening a door for a sale to foreign powers, and a re∣linquishment of the powers, of taxation until the propri∣etors choose to be represented, which is in fact dismem∣bering the state, and which transfer and relinquishment of taxation cannot be for the good of the state.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Because there was no necessity or pressing urgency for the sale of such an immense tract of territory, equal to some European kingdoms, to carry into execution, and operation, the extinguishment of the Indian claims to the lands between the Oconee and Okmulgee, contemplated by the act entitled "An act for appropriating a part of the unlocated territory of this state for payment of the late state troops, and for other purposes therein mention∣ed;" the subterfuge on which the said usurped act of the seventh of January, one thousand seven hundred and nine∣ty-five was founded, when the whole amount of the appro∣priation
<PB N="98" REF="035588_0101_1005F85A0E1890F8"/>for that purpose was but thirty thousand dollars, and funds to a greater amount were then in the treasury unappropriated: And because no state or nation is justifi∣ed in wantonly dissipating its property or revenues, and a legal alienation of which can only take place from the most pressing necessity; and the territory attempted to be disposed of, was the said usurped law valid, was wantonly dissipated, it being disposed of for the trifling sum of five hundred thousand dollars, a sum not adequate to the anu∣al quit rents such lands were charged with previously to the revolution of the british King; which wanton dissi∣pation cannot be for the good of the state.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Because exclusive of the immense loss of revenue to which the state is exposed from the relinquishment of taxation, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars was ac∣cepted as the consideration money for the sale, and the sum of eight hundred thousand dollars offered by persons of as large a capital, and as much respectability and credit, and on terms more advantageous to the state, was refused; which as it was (should the said usurped act have been considered valid) a clear loss of three hundred thousand dollars to the revenues of the state, it is evident that the law authorising the sale was not deemed by the members of the legislature for "the good of the state," which must have consisted in obtaining the highest price and the most advantageous terms.</P>
<P N="6">6th. For the very excellent reasons given by his ex∣cellency the governor in his dissent to the first bill for the disposal of the said territory, delivered to the house of re∣presentatives on the twentyninth of December, one thou∣sand seven hundred and ninety-four, and which bill was not materially different from the act in question; and which reasons prove, that his excellency as a negative branch of the legislature, although he concurred in the law, did not deem it for "the good of the state," and which dissent was in the words following.</P>
<P N="1">1st. I doubt whether the proper time is arrived for dispo∣sing of the territory in question.</P>
<P N="2">2d. If it was the proper time, the sum offered is inade∣quate to the value of the land.</P>
<P N="3">3. The quantity reserved for the citizens is too small, in proportion to the extent of the purchase.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That greater advantages are secured to the pur∣chasers than to the citizens-</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="99" REF="035588_0102_1005F830633A3810"/>
5th. That so large an extent of territory being dispos∣ed of to companies of individuals, will operate as mono∣polies, which will prevent or retard settlements, population and agricultuae.</P>
<P N="6">6th. That should such disposition be made, at least one fourth of the lands should be reserved for the future dispo∣sal of the state.</P>
<P N="7">7th. That if public notice was given, that the land was for sale, the rivalship in purchasers would most pro∣bably have increased the sums offered.</P>
<P N="8">8th. The power given to the executive by the consti∣tution, the duty I owe the community, and the sacredness of my oath of office, I flatter myself, will justify this dissent in the minds of the members of the legislature, and of my other fellow citizens.</P>
<P>And whereas the said usurped law passed on the seventh day of January, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, is also repugnant to the afore cited sixteenth section, in as much as it is repugnant to the seventeenth or subse∣quent section of the said first article, which declares: They (the legislature) shall have power to alter the boun∣daries of the present counties, and to lay off new ones, as well out of the counties already laid off, as out of the other territory belonging to the state. When a new county or counties shall be laid off out of any present county or counties, such new county or counties shall have their representation apportioned out of the number of representatives of the county or counties out of which it or they shall be laid out, and when any new county shall be laid off in the vacant terrrity belonging to the state, such county shall have a number of representatives not ex∣ceeding three, to be regulated and determined by the ge∣neral assembly:" And the territory disposed of not lay∣ing within the limits of any county already laid off, and a sale and grant thereof, should the said usurped law be deemed valid, having been made, it could not be defined the vacant territory belonging to the state, whereby the constitutional powers vested in the general assembly by the seventeenth section would be barred and prevented, and consequentry the settlers on the territory sold be de∣prived of the constitutional right of representation, and is not only thus repugnant to the said sixteenth and seven∣teenth sections, but thereby and by the relinquishment of
<PB N="100" REF="035588_0103_1005F833D3DC88A0"/>the right of taxation, until the settlers are represented, which they cannot constitutionally be, is also repugnant to the whole letter and spirit of the constitution, in ope∣rating as a dereliction of jurisdictional rights, and a vir∣tual dismemberment of the state.</P>
<P>And whereas in and by the articles of confederation en∣tered into and finally ratified on the first of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty one, by the then thir∣teen states of America, the territory within the limits of each of the said states is to each of them respectively con∣firmed and guaranteed, first by the second article, to wit, "Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and inde∣pendence, and power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by the confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled." And secondly, by the last clause in the second section of the ninth article, "No state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States, "And in and by the first clause of the sixth article of the federal constitution of the United States, All engagements entered into before the adoption of the said constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under the said constitution as under the confedera∣tion:" and by the twelfth article of the amendments to the said constitution, ratified and adopted, The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people."</P>
<P>And whereas in and by the definitive treaty of peace signed at Paris on the third of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, the boundaries of the United. States were established, and the United States ful∣ly recognized and acknowledged by the first article there∣of, in the words following: "His Britannic majesty ac∣knowledges the said United States, viz. New-Hamp∣shire, Massachuseets-bay, Rhode-Island and Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ma∣ryland Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia, to be free, sovereign and independent states, that he treats with them as such, and for himself, his heirs and successors, relinquishes all claims, to the government proprietary and territorial rights of the same;" and by the second article it is declared; "And that all disputes which might arise in future on the subject of the boundaries of
<PB N="101" REF="035588_0104_1005F8364165C5D8"/>the said United States may be prevented it is hereby a∣greed that the following are and shall be their bounda∣ries." And those boundaries thereby declared, which li∣mit the westwardly and southwardly parts of this state, are thus defined: "Along the middle of the Mississippi until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude; south by a line drawn due east from the termination of the line last mentioned in the lati∣tude of thirty-one degrees north of the equator, to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chatahooche: thence along the middle thereof to its junction with Flint river: thence straight to the head of St. Mary's river; and thence along the middle of St. Mary's river to the At∣lantic ocean;" and the king of Great Britain did, by proclamation dated the seventh day of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three, annex to the then province of Georgia, all the lands laying be∣tween the said river St. Mary's and the Alatamaha, its former boundary claimed by South-Carolina under her charters; and the state of South-Carolina, in and by a convention held and concluded between the commissioners of the said states, at Beaufort, under the authority and ar∣ticles of the confederation, on the twenty-eighth of April one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, did con∣firm to the state of Georgia the southward and westward∣ly boundaries described in the said treaty of Paris, by ces∣sion and relinquishment of all right, title and claim which the said state possessed from the original charter thereof, to the government, sovereignty and jurisdiction in and over the same, and also the right of pre-emption of the soil from the native Indians, and all other the estate, property and claim, in or to the said land; and the boun∣daries so described also coincide with the houndaries of this state described by the land act of this state now in force, passed at Savannah, the seventeenth of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, (except as to the northern boundary of the state) which by the said con∣vention is thus established and ratified by the first article thereof: "The most northern branch or stream of the river Savannah from the sea or mouth of such stream, to the fork or confluence of the rivers now called Tugaloo or Keowee, and from thence to the most northern branch or stream of the said river Tugaloo, till it intersects the
<PB N="102" REF="035588_0105_1005F838990E6DC0"/>north boundary line of South-Carolina, if the said branch or stream of Tugaloo, extends so far north, re∣serving all the islands in the said rivers Savannah and Tugaloo to Georgia; but if the head spring or source of any branch or streams of the said river Tugaloo does not extend to the north boundary of South Carolina, then a west line to the Mississippi."</P>
<P>And Whereas until the formation of the confederation there could possibly belong no territorial rights to the United States, nor after such formation within the char∣tered limits of any state, but such as were specially ceded and relinquished by the respective states; and the peo∣ple of the state of Geoagia have by no act of theirs, or in any manner or shape whatever, transferred or aliened or delegated a power to transfer or alien the territory at∣tempted to be disposed of by the said usurped act passed on the seventh of January in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, and the same and every part thereof is hereby declared to be vested in the state and people thereof, and inalienable, but by a convention cal∣led by the people for that express purpose, or by some clause of power expressed by the people delegating such express power to the legislature in the constitution.</P>
<P>And whereas divested of all fundamental and constitu∣tional authority which the said usurped act might be de∣clared by its advocates, and those who claim under it, to be founded on, fraud has been practised to obtain it, and the grant under it. And it is a fundamental principle both of law and equity, that there cannot be a wrong without a remedy, and the state and the citizens thereof have suf∣fered a most grievous injury in the barter of their rights by the said usurped act and grants, and there is no court existing if the dignity of the state would permit her entering one, for the trial of fraud and collu∣sion of individuals, or to contest her sovereignty with them, whereby the remedy for so notorious an injury could be obtained: and it can no where better lay than with the representatives of the people chosen by them, af∣ter due promulgation by the grand juries of most of the counties of the state, of the means practised, and by the remonstrances of the people to the convention, held on the tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, setting forth the atrocious speculation, cor∣ruption and collusion, by which the said usurped act and grants were obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035588_0106_1005F83AFAFBD2B0"/>
And whereas the said petitions and remonstrances of the good people composing the state, to the said late conven∣tion held at Louisville on the said tenth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, produced a re∣solution of that body in the following words: "<HI>Resolved,</HI> That it is the opinion of this convention, from the num∣bers, respectability, and ground of complaint stated in the sundry petitions laid before them, that this is a sub∣ject of importance meriting legislative deliberation. <HI>Or∣dered therefore,</HI> That such petitions be preserved by the Secretary, and laid before the next legislature at their en∣suing session." Which resolution invests this legislature with conventional powers, <HI>quo ad hoc,</HI> or in common terms, for the purpose of investigating the same, and which gives additional validity to legislative authority, were the powers of one legislature over the acts of ano∣ther to be attempted to be questioned.</P>
<P>And whereas it does appear from sundry affidavits and a variety of proofs satisfactory to this Legislature, as well as from the presentments of the grand Juries on oath of a considerable majority of the counties of the state, and by the afore-recited petitions and remenstrances of the good people thereof to the Convention, and by numerous pe∣titions to this present legislature to the same purport, as also from the self evident proof of fraud, arising from the rejection of eight hundred thousand dollars, and the accep∣tance of five hundred thousand dollars, as the considera∣tion money for which the said territory was sold; that fraud and corruption were practised to obtain the said act and grants, and that a majority of those members of the Legislature who voted in favor of the aforesaid act, were engaged in the purchase; and a majority of one vote only appeared in favor of the said usurped act in the senate, and on which majority in that branch the same was passed, and corruption appears against more than one member of that body; which exclusive of the many de∣ceptions used, and the inadequacy of price for such an im∣mense and valuable tract of country, would be sufficient in equity, reason, and law, to invalidate the contract, e∣ven supposing it to be constitutional, which this Legisla∣ture declares it is not.</P>
<P><HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> That the said usurped act, passed on the seventh day of January in the year one thousand se∣ven
<PB N="104" REF="035588_0107_1005F83E4566B4A8"/>hundred and ninety-five, entitled, "An act supplimen∣tary to an act entitled, an act for appropriating a part of the unlecated territory of this state, for the payment of the late state troops, and for other purposes therein men∣tioned; declaring the right of this state to the unappro∣priated territory thereof, for the protection of the fron∣tiers, and for other purposes," be and the same is hereby annulled, rendered void, and of no effect: and as the same was made without constitutional authority, and fraudulently obtained, it is declared of no binding force or effect on this state or the people thereof; but is and are to be considered both law and grant as they ought to be <HI>ipso sacto</HI> of themselves void, and the territory therein mentioned is also hereby declared to be the sole property of the state, subject only to the right of treaty of the U∣nited States to enable the state to perchase under its pre∣emption right the Indian title to the same.</P>
<P><HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That within three days after the passing of this act the different branches of the Legi∣slature shall assemble together: at which meeting the officers shall uttend with the several records, documents and deeds in the Secretary's and Surveyor- General's and other public offices, and which records and docu∣ments, shall then and there be expunged from the face and indexes of the books of record of the state, and the enrolled law or usurped act shall then be publicly burnt, in order that no trace of so inconstitutional, vile and fraudulent a transaction, other than the infamy attached to it by this law shall remain in the public officers there∣of; and it is hereby declared the duty of the county officers of record, where any conveyance, bond or other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whatever, shall have been recorded, relating to the sale of the said territory, under the said usurped act, to produce the book wherein the said deed, bond or covey∣ance may be so recorded, to the Superior Court at the next lesson of the court after the passing this law, and which court is hereby directed to cause said clerk or keeper of the public records of the court to obliterate the same in their presence; and if such clerk or keeper of rec∣ords, neglect or refuse so to do, he shall be and is hereby declared incapable of holding any office of trust or con∣fidence in this state, and the Superior Court shall suspend him: And from and after the passing of this act, if any clerk of a county, notary public, or other officer keeping record, shall enter any transaction, agreement, conveyance grant,

<P><HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That the said usurped law passed on the seventh of January, in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, shall not, nor shall any grant or grants issued by virtue thereof; or any deed or conveyance, agreement or contract, scrip or paper relative thereto, be received as evidence in any court of law or equity of this state, so far as it establishes a right to the said territory or to any part thereof: <HI>Provided.</HI> That no∣thing herein contained shall be construed to prevent such deed or conveyance, agreement or contract between individuals, scrip issued by the pretended purchasers, or other paper, from being received as evidence in pri∣vate actions for the recovery of any monies or other in∣terest given, paid or exchanged, as the consideration for pretended sales by the original pretended purchasers or persons claiming and selling by and under them.</P>

<P><HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That any pretended power assumed, or intended by the said act, or any clause; or let∣ter

<P>The legislature of the state of Georgia by an act of the 7th January 1795, directed a sale to be made of a certain
<PB N="108" REF="035588_0111_1005F848737EB958"/>tract of land, therein described to James Gunn, and others, by the name of the Georgia company; upon certain con∣ditions therein specified. The sale was made pursuant to the act: the conditions of sale were performed by the pur∣chasers, and a regular grant made to them accordingly of the said tract of land. Subsequent thereto, the said legis∣lature has passed an act, whereby on the suggestion of un∣constitutionality for various reasons (prout the act) and also of fraud and corruption in application to the legisla∣tive body, the first act, and the grants thereupon; are declared null and void.</P>
<P>On the foregoing case, the opinion of counsel is de∣sired, whether the title of the grantees and their assigns, the latter being <HI>bonafide,</HI> purchasers of them for valuable considerations be valid; or whether the last mentioned act be of force to annul the grant?</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Never having examined the title of the state of Geor∣gia to the lands in question, I have no knowledge whe∣ther that state was itself entitled to them and in capacity to make a valid grant. I can therefore have no opinion on this point.—But assuming it in the argument as a fact, that the state of Georgia had at the time of the grant a good title to the land, I hold that the revocation of it is void, and that the grant is still in force.</P>
<P>Without pretending to judge of the original merits or demerits of the purchasers, it may be safely said to be a contravention of the first principles of natural justice and social policy, without any judicial decision of facts, by a positive act of legislature, to revoke a grant of property re∣gularly made for valuable consideration, under legisla∣tive authority, to the prejudice even of third persons on every supposition innocent of the alledged fraud or cor∣ruption; and it may be added that the precedent is new of revoking a grant on the suggestion of corruption of a legislative body.—Nor do I perceive sufficient ground for the suggestion of unconstitutionality in the first act.</P>
<P>In addition to these general considerations, placing the revocation in a very unfavourable light, the constitu∣tion of the United States, article first, section tenth declares that no state shall pass a law impairing the obli∣gations of contract. This must be equivalent to saying
<PB N="109" REF="035588_0112_1005F84A09EE6778" MS="y"/>no state shall pass a law revoking, invalidating, or altering a contract. Every grant from one to another, whether the grantor be a state or an individual, is virtually a contract that the grantee shall hold and enjoy the thing granted a∣gainst the grantor, and his representatives. It therefore appears to me that taking the terms of the constitution, in their large sense, and giving them effect according to the general spirit and policy of the provisions: the Revoca∣tion of the grant by the act of the legislatiure of Georgia, may justly be considered as contrary to the constitution of the United States, and therefore null. And that the courts of the United States in cases within their jurisdiction will be likely to pronounce it so.</P>
