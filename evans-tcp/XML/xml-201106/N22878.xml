<HEAD>DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESEN∣TATIVES. <HI>(Continued from page</HI> 67.)</HEAD>
<P>MR. S. SMITH observed, that, <Q>were there but <HI>one man,</HI> and he a <HI>negro,</HI> suffering under the gal∣ling <HI>yoke</HI> of <HI>impressment,</HI> it was the duty of the government to provide <HI>relief</HI> for that man.</Q> Now, Mr. Smith, have you not several negroes? How easy, then, is it for you to do an act of phi∣lanthropy, without application to the government, and without plunging the country into a dangerous dispute with another nation? You will say, with∣out doubt, that your negroes are not suffering un∣der the galling "yoke of impressment;" but, where is the difference, whether they are under the yoke of the British or under your yoke; slavery is still slavery; nor is the yoke the weight of a hair lighter, for lasting durante vita, or because it is im∣posed

by a man who pretends to be the advocate of liberty.</P>
<P>Nothing that I have said, or shall say, on this subject, is intended to justify the British in their im∣pressment of <HI>Americans:</HI> I look upon their conduct in this respect as tyrannical; as the effect of that overbearing insolence which is the characteristic of but too many among their subaltern officers, and I think that redress ought to be obtained, with all convenient speed. But, I here confine myself to <HI>Americans alone,</HI> by which word I mean, those who were born in the United States, or were inhabi∣tants of them at the peace of 1783, not including <HI>deserters from the British during the war.</HI> These are Americans, and no others are, and, I venture to predict, that, whatever schemes the Congress may fall on, whatever registers, certificates or oaths of civism they may think proper to furnish sailors with, Great Britain will ever seize hers, where she finds them.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON said, that <Q>it would be no difficult matter to prove, that foreigners natural∣ized since the Declaration of Independence, were entitled to the protection of the govern∣ment.</Q> He attempted to prove this, and I shall not contradict him, for the thing is, in itself so evidently absurd as to need no remark.—As to what he pleases to call the <HI>naturalization of foreigners</HI> (whole cargoes at a time or otherwise) the rights of citizenship they enjoy under their new masters, &amp;c. &amp;c. shall be reserved for a future opportunity. It will be sufficient to add, on this article, that a bill was at last agreed to for appointing agents for the relief and protection of impressed seamen. But if these agents are to be employed (as the instru∣ments

of a predominant) faction to embroil this country in a war, it were far better they had never been appointed.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<HEAD>PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. <DATE><HI>MARCH</HI> 2nd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON (from N. York) said that it was ge∣nerally understood that some important constitutional que∣stions would be discussed, when the treaty lately conclud∣ed between this country and Great Britain should come under consideration, it was very desirable, therefore, that every document which might tend to throw light on the subject should be before the House.—For this purpose, he would move the following resolution:</P>
<P><Q>Resolved, that the President of the United States be requested to lay before this House, a copy of the in∣structions given to the minister of the United States who negociated the treaty with Great Britain, commu∣nicated by his message on the 1st inst. together with the correspondence and documents relative to the said treaty.</Q> Ordered to lie on the table.</P>
<P>To this resolution the following exception was after∣wards added:—<Q>excepting such of said papers as any existing negociation may render improper to be dis∣closed.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. TRACEY (Connecticut) requested the gentleman who brought forward this resolution to give his reasons for doing so. He had at present only told the House that, as the constitutionality of the treaty might be discussed, he thought it necessary to propose the measure. It was well known by every man in that House that much differ∣ence of opinion, and much sensibility had been occasioned by the treaty in question all over the Union.—He thought that the only way to treat the matter fairly, would be for every member on that floor to come forward and express himself openly. Perhaps the happiness of the country
<PB N="74" REF="030221_0006_0FE5283907F71FA0"/>
might depend upon the issue of their deliberations upon it. In order to avoid all bitterness and misunderstanding, it would be best for members to come forward at first and state their opinions fully. He, therefore asked why this motion was made? If made barely to enable the House to examine into the constitutionality of the treaty, he thought that might be determined by comparing it with the constitution itself. It may be thought necessary that these papers be produced in order to impeach any of the persons employed in the negociation, or the Precident. He wished to know for what purpose these papers are called. He thought to declare the whole intention of the motion would be a means of harmonizing the House upon the subject. However, until he knew the real intention, he would hope it was a good one. If he disagreed from the honourable mover, he should give his reasons for it, it was a delicate subject. That they had a right to the papers called for for a good purpose, could not be doubted, but unless the House had real occasion for them, the President would be justified, in keeping them where they are. What, said he, do we want with these papers? Is it to make a better treaty, or to do away the one made? He wished to know the mover's reasons fully.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON said he had never any wish to con∣ceal his intention, as he trusted he never should have any which he should be ashamed to avow. The gentleman asked with propriety for information: he answered, his motion was made for the purpose of gaining information. He asked to what particular point. It may be to all the points he has mentioned. It was impossible to know un∣til the papers were before him. He wished for infor∣mation, the result would depend upon the information re∣ceived. He did not know that the impeachment of any person would be determined upon by that House. He did not think so himself; but he thought it necessary they should have an opportunity of making a fair judgment of the matter. They were the proper persons to whom was delegated the power of punishing officers; they ought therefore, to have full opportunity of judging of their conduct. It was simply for information that the resolu∣tion asked, not only with respect to the officers who were employed on the occasion, but with respect to the thing
<PB N="75" REF="030221_0007_0FE5283A996AE5A0"/>
itself. He believed, that House had the power to carry into effect any Treaty, or not. It was for this purpose that he wanted information; and if the House were of the same opinion, they would support the motion. Some∣thing had been said as to the delicacy of the subject. If, said he, any reason of State will not permit the President to give the papers they asked for, he will give his reasons for refusing them. He meant not to invade the rights of any branch of government; it was information which he sought for.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (Virginia) said he would briefly state the reasons which induced him to support the passing of the resolution which lay on the table. The gentleman from Connecticut had justly said that the treaty had caused great sensibility throughout the United States. It was on this account that he wanted that information which they had a right to expect, and without which they could not pro∣ceed to consider the subject. If he were to judge of the treaty itself, it would not allay that sensibility which had been raised against it, but he trusted the information which was called for would be of a sort to reconcile the public mind. If no information was given he must own it would have an unfavorable impression on his mind. He wished, therefore, for information.</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY (Maryland) observed that if the mover of the resolution before the House had clearly declared that the object of it was for information, he should not have an objection to it; but the explanation given, led him to be∣lieve that it had in view the establishment of a very alarm∣ing doctrine—no less than to determine whether the trea∣ty shall be carried into effect or not. By the Constitution, he said, the treaty was become the law of the land, and obligatory on all the citizens of the United States. From the explanation given, he should give the measure his de∣cided negative; for if that House had the power to decide on the legality of the treaty, in vain has the Constitution given power to the President and Senate to make treaties. It appeared to him that the House had no right to enquire into the particular ground upon which this treaty has be∣come the law of the land, since it appears that the Presi∣dent and Senate have acted agreeably to the Constitution.
<PB N="76" REF="030221_0008_0FE527596F2A0150"/>
It would be a solecism in Government, to say that there were two powers which could controul each other. He thought the resolution unconstitutional, as it was predi∣cated on the right of that House to interfere with the pow∣er placed in the President and Senate to make treaties. In order to justify this motion, the House should first de∣termine the treaty to be unconstitutional, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not to be the law of the land. If it was agreed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> House had a right to examine all the secrets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> negociations, a plan will be adopted which may open se¦crets that may be of great injury to the nation. Every man knows, said he, that in diplomatic transactions there are certain secret negociations; he did not know that it was the case in this, but it might be so. To carry into effect this resolution, appeared to him a direct invasion upon the constitutional rights placed in the President, in conjunction with the Senate. He doubted whether the Senate could make this demand.</P>
<P>Thus did the discussion wander from its object. This motion of Mr. Livingston was the signal of hostile preparation. The Friends of the treaty took the alarm, and the question became, not whether the House had a right to call for the pa∣pers or not, but whether their sanction was neces∣sary to the execution of a treaty.</P>
<P>The debates occupied the House and the pub∣lic during nearly a month. It is incompatible with my plan to give all the speeches at length, many of which do honour to the hearts and ma∣ny others to the heads of the speakers: among the former may be noticed those of Messieurs Buck, Sedgwick, Harper and William Smith; among the latter, those of Messieurs Gallatin and Giles; and, on the whole, the debate contains as masterly a display of polemical talents as, perhaps, was ever exhibited by any assembly in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="030221_0009_0FE5287860BFB290"/>I shall content myself with inserting here two of these speeches only, which as they contain the substance of all that was said on both sides, will suffice, at once to give the reader a complete view of the arguments adduced, and a specimen of the rhetorical abilities of the members of the House of Representatives.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES said, when the present motion was first brought forward, he saw no other consideration attached to it, than the expediency, or inexpediency of calling for the papers in question. It was expected the President was possessed of information respecting the treaty, as such it became a question whether it was not proper to make a call for it. The very referring of the treaty to a com∣mittee of the whole shewed an intention of acting upon it. Indeed the communication from the President at the opening of the session, shewed that he expected that House to exercise an agency on the treaty. It appeared to him, that if the papers would serve to explain any thing in the treaty, it was desireable to have them. He was one of those who, in reflecting on the treaty, and judging from the face of it, felt unfavorably towards it. He was per∣swaded that he had the right, and he conceived it to be his duty, to oppose the execution of, the instrument; but, knowing there was great responsibility attached to the business, he wished for information. For the final issue, the weight of responsibility would never make him swerve from his duty. These were his motives for con∣curring in the motion.</P>
<P>That the House had a right to call for these papers was not denied; the right being conceded, it appeared to him that they might have confined themselves to the expediency of the motion. But the opposition had not been so much against the motion, as against the argu∣ments which have been used, that do not relate to the subject. But tho' he believed that these were all the con∣sequences, yet, as it seemed to be deemed a test respect∣ing another business, and members appeared inclined now to express an opinion on that head, he would ask indul∣gence
<PB N="78" REF="030221_0010_0FE52815C362B6E8"/>
of the committee whilst he stated his sentiments on that subject.</P>
<P>The real question appeared to be this, whether the treaty making power, can receive any check, in conse∣quence of provisions placed in the Congress of the United States, and whether they have a right to question the me∣rits of the instruments?—Various arguments have been used to shew, that that House have not the power to ex∣amine the treaty, or check its execution. Some of them have grown from the Constitution, others from the face of the instrument. Though, he said, it would have been more agreeable to him to have explained his sentiments in a different way, yet, as gentlemen have chosen to en∣ter upon the discussion of the great Constitutional questi∣on, he should proceed to answer the objections which had been urged against what he conceived to be the pow∣ers of that assembly.</P>
<P>Of the description of objection against the rights of that House, which grew out of the instrument itself, he should begin with remarks on what had fallen from the gentleman from South Carolina yesterday. That gentle∣man had introduced the Convention held in the state of Virginia near the time of adopting the Constitution, and said, that it proposed an amendment, containing, amongst other checks, one respecting the treaty power, viz. that there should be a concurrence of two thirds of the whole of the Senate, instead of two thirds of the Senate present. He believed it was so. But he would ask the gentleman how this operated? The amendment was not to lessen, but to increase the checks, which, from the extent of the treaty making power, as it stands in the Constitution, was thought to be necessary. But how the gentleman could infer that they believed there was no other check, he was at a loss to determine. If he would refer to the proceed∣ings of that Convention, he would find the reasons urged in support of the proposed amendments, which, indeed, were the opinions of individuals only. The next consi∣deration which he resorted to was, that of the opinion of certain citizens, at a meeting held at New-York, to shew that they considered the business of the treaty, wholly an executive business. He little expected, from a gentleman
<PB N="79" REF="030221_0011_0FE527952199C2C8"/>
who is apt to speak rather contemptuously of such assem∣blies, that the proceedings of town's meeting should have been adduced in support of his argument. He ac∣knowledged that the expressions of such meetings of the people would always have an effect on his mind. Was the gentleman willing to rely on the opinions of those whom he has mentioned? If not, why introduce them? If the gentleman will admit that such meetings are the or∣thodox expositors of the public Constitution, as they are expositors of the will, he had no objections to their being adduced. It did not appear, however, that he drew cor∣rectly the sentiments of the public meeting in question; it was held to petition the President to withhold his signa∣ture from the treaty. Would not the strongest arguments, then, be used to induce the President not to execute the treaty? But he wished to be permitted to take the gentle∣man's own rule. What was the situation of their table; was it not covered with petitions from all parts of the Union against the treaty? Finding their petitions in vain to the President, the people flew to that House, and the table never had, upon any occasion, so many petitions up∣on it, praying them not to give up the rights which the constitution had placed in their hands, of checking the treaty making power.—The next argument adduced by the gentleman was, the opinion expressed in the amend∣ments lately proposed by the State of Virginia, to the constitution; from which, he drew an implication that there was at present no check on the treaty making power, it was not so. It had not been contended that there was any particular words in the constitution which directly goes to this construction, but that it grows out of ano∣ther powers. This was the idea of the State of Virginia. The amendment was proposed to relieve them from con∣structive power, by giving them an express power. It was unnecessary to remind them of the fate which these amendments had met with. He hoped, however, the State of Virginia would persue that conduct which had always marked her political character; and he trusted it would be admitted, that she was not more distinguished for her love of liberty, than she was for her love of vir∣tue, of order and good conduct at home. He prided himself in being a Representative of such a state; and he
<PB N="80" REF="030221_0012_0FE528A35242ED40"/>
was persuaded, though her sister states differed from her in opinion, she would never cease to pay them proper respect. He was sorry the subject had been mentioned. If Virginia, he said, had been the cause of indelicacy in others, she was the innocent cause and therefore not re∣sponsible. In making the proposed amendments, she was impelled by the best motives to attain an important object, an object, which, he doubted not, would ultimately be attended with success.</P>
<P>The gentleman from South-Carolina had resorted to another subject with but little success. He read a reso∣lution from the journals of the house, importing, that when treaties were made under the authority of the United States, they should be annexed to the laws.</P>
<P>He believed it proper they should be so. But does this shew that the practice of the House had been against ex∣pressing their opinion on great national objects? The gentleman's next observation was with respect to appro∣priations for carrying into effect Indian treaties, saying that there was no difference betwixt treaties with foreign nations, and treaties with the Indian tribes. Mr. Giles remarked there always had been a distinction.—In the time of the Colonial Government, that distinction was made and it had never been done away. By means of Indian treaties, the treaty-making power had been vastly increas∣ed, he could not say whether for a good or bad purpose. Provision had been made for carrying Indian treaties in∣to effect, because they thought it right. But suppose a motion had been made to strike out the appropriation clause, in one of those bills, would it have been out of order? No. That question had been lately discussed (he referred to the business respecting the mint) and determi∣ned upon. There was another subject that gentleman mentioned, which he was very sorry to hear, though he seemed to plume himself upon it, that the President of the United States had accompanied the publication of this treaty with his proclamation to carry it into effect. Why was this mentioned? It was not to illuminate that House. He was afraid it might have a tendency to check investi∣gation. Persons were too often brought before that House; not to illustrate a subject, but to hinder free debate. He
<PB N="81" REF="030221_0013_0FE528416105DF68"/>
would even admit that the President believed that that House had not the right to judge of the treaty. Were his opinion to be authority? No. What is the nature of the question? It implies contested rights of different branch∣es of government. His introducing the President, there∣fore, as an authoritative opinion, might alarm, but could not convince. Notwithstanding the President's proclama∣tion, he still thought the treaty was sent to that House to be acted upon.</P>
<P>Having answered most of the objections from collateral sources, he should proceed to more interesting matter— to the Constitution itself, it was a little unfortunate, he said, that sentiments could not be so combined as to pro∣duce always the same ideas in every mind. Hence arose difference of opinion.—It is not wonderful, that in the Congress of the United States, there should be a variety of opinion. Of all the expositions of the treaty-making power, he thought that was the least probable and most dangerous, which fell from the member from Connecti∣cut—That power, he informed the House, was undefined in its nature, unlimited in its object, and supreme in its operation. He would not say there had been no attempts at a definition of this extravagant power. It was said, it might embrace legislative objects by compacts. He would not say that objection had been attended to, that it could not go beyond the Constitution, nor encroach on power placed by the Constitution in any branch of Government.</P>
<P>On this construction he would examine the question. The first consequence was, that the treaty supercedes the discussion of that House. The next was, that it repeals all laws which stand in its way. When he proceeded to examine the constitution, he would touch on both those particulars. He would remark, that as far as he had been able to examine the history of mankind, there was always an effort of the people to guard their rights, and an op∣posite effort in government to encroach on them. The American people were called upon to establish such a con∣stitution as would ensure their rights and liberties. It had been said that the American people had been more sagaci∣ous than any other nation. But whilst it appears that they have been more sagacious to furnish checks, there have not
<PB N="82" REF="030221_0014_0FE52796AC1752B0"/>
been wanting continual attempts to invade them. In no nation has the doctrine of checks been so completely routed as in this, and if the opinions now contended for, prevail, nothing will remain to be done by checks. This construction has been deduced from two sources. One from the constitution, and the other from the nature of the thing. Gentlemen have read the clause of the consti∣tution which gives a power to the President and Senate to make treaties. Here they stop, and say that this gives them a complete authority. If there was no other clause, it might be so. But let the question be examined. The gentlemen then resort to another clause, viz. <Q>This con∣stitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land.</Q> Here they stop again, and if there were no other words, it would seem to support their doctrine. But the clause ex∣plains itself, <Q>and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.</Q> Can any thing be more evident, that this clause relates to former en∣croachments of particular states? It was necessary that the constitution and laws of each state should yield to the general Government. Gentlemen finding difficulties oc∣cur, contend for the supremacy of treaties over all laws. It is admitted the clauses of the constitution will not sup∣port this: and he would ask where they found the doc∣trine, that treaties are superior to laws? Gentlemen say that it is from the nature of things. He believed the reverse. In this point he differed from the gentleman from Pennsylvania; for he would contend that laws could annul treaties, but that treaties could not annul laws. This being a new doctrine, he would beg leave to illus∣trate it. He inferred it from the nature of the two pow∣ers. Gentlemen assert that treaties cannot be repealed, because they consist of two parts, and nothing less than the consent of both, or war, can annul them. He would ask that House, if they ever heard of a convention be∣tween two foreign nations for this purpose? if it could be done, he should wish another envoy extraordinary to be appointed and sent to repeal this treaty. But no such meeting having ever taken place, from whence comes this
<PB N="83" REF="030221_0015_0FE52786AE88F6C0"/>
theory? But is it reasonable that laws should repeal trea∣ties? Yes. But why? because laws were the expression of the national will, through its proper organ.</P>
<P>It is admitted on all hands, said Mr. Giles, that Con∣gress has the power of declaring war; suppose it did de∣clare war with Great Britain, would not the treaty be an∣nulled? would the treaty operate during the war? No. At least that part of it which speaks of mutual amity, would be destroyed. He would go farther, the treaty makes an equalization of duties in the Canada trade. Could not this regulation be repealed? but this it might be said, would lead to war. That might be; but he contended for the right. He said that a law pro tanto renders the treaty void. Suppose Great Britain by her parliament, were to repeal any law relative the treaty, what would be the consequence? Great Britain would make herself responsible. True; but she might do it. Treaties were said not to be repealable; was not that say∣ing that the laws of the United States were like the laws of the Medes and Persians, which change not? if gentle∣men took time to examine the doctrine they would find it less sound than they expected.</P>
<P>In proportion as an authority was supposed to be un∣limited or undefined, in the same proportion was the ne∣cessity of a check upon it. When he looked into the constitution, he found this check. Would it not, indeed have been the height of folly in the people to have given unbounded power with respect to making treaties, whilst some of the regulations in the constitution give instances of well founded jealousy in their rulers? if the doctrine contended for were just, it would afford a remarkable in∣stance of the folly of the American people.</P>
<P>The constitution, he said, contained a distribution of powers. It had three distinct checks. The first related to the different species of authority. Each distinct au∣thority was placed in separate hands. The next was, the same species of authority is placed in two different branch∣es of the government, which renders a concurrence of opi∣nion necessary to any act. Another check, or denial of
<PB N="84" REF="030221_0016_0FE52777E17FFD20"/>
authority altogether, was the qualified veto of the Presi∣dent.</P>
<P>As an instance of the caution which the people thought necessary against the encroachment of power, it was made an article of the constitution that no appropriation for an army could he made for more than two years. By which it appears that they were not satisfied, though they had provided that there should be a concurrence of sentiment in the Senate and Legislature, but determined to prevent the posibility of keeping up an army establishment longer than necessary. Another check was the biennial elections, as every new election was considered as a fresh check up∣on the executive. No one will doubt that this was the motive; and the doctrine at present insisted on, seemed to shew the necessity of this caution.</P>
<P>The checks on the treaty making power might consist of several parts; he should rely upon two. The first was, the necessity for the concurrence of that House to give the efficacy to a treaty whenever it embraces any object which is contained in the power given by the constitution to Congress. The President and Senate, it is acknowledged, have power to make treaties; but who have the power to regulate commerce? Congress. Who have the power to declare war? Congress. Who have the power to raise armies? Congress. Gentlemen talked much about the will of the people. If he <HI>adored any thing on earth, he said, it was the will of the people.</HI> The question was, what was the will of the people? That will was expressed in the constitution. And that House, being the direct represen∣tatives of the people, might be reasonably supposed to be the representatives of the public will; and it was necessary, therefore, that they should concur in a measure of so great importance as that of a commerical treaty. But gentle∣men seem to speak of that House as mere cyphers. What was the oath they took on taking their seats? Not to sit silent to see the rights of the people invaded; but to guard the constitution. Shall they them shrink from their duty; be trusted they would not.</P>
<P>The other check to the treaty making power, was that of the right of appropriation placed in Congress. <Q>No
<PB N="85" REF="030221_0017_0FE527A0713171E0"/>
money shall be drawn from the treasury but in conse∣quence of appropriations made by law.</Q> Whence came this caution? From the same spirit which dictated the other checks in the constitution. Without an appropria∣tion no mischief can be effected. He would ask the meaning of the word law? Law, said he, is a rule of conduct prescribed by competent authority, Does the law mentioned in this clause refer to the treaty making power? No. What does it mean? It refers to Congress and not to the treaty making power, then the law necessary to make appropriation is the exercise of the whole of the authority appointed by the people to make laws. But gentlemen finding that a new distinction must be made with respect to discrimination, have undertaken a new definition. The gentleman from Connecticut, speaking on this sub∣ject, asked whether all distinction was to be disclaimed? No, he said they were to exercise sound discretion; but he was at a loss to know what discretion was left them, if they might not refuse to appropriate money to carry in∣to effect what appeared to them mischievous. The gen∣tleman from South Carolina attempted to define this sort of discretion, and finished his remarks by saying, that they could never have a right to do wrong. But this did not define their idea. He would undertake to define the discretion they set up, it was a predestinated discretion, not giving its votaries a power of choice, but impelling them by necessity. Indeed the whole force of the remarks of gentlemen, was to recommend an easy, docile kind of discretion, which would be influenced by the opinions of others. Some gentlemen finding this doctrine would not do, have taken what they call moral obligation as their ground. He hoped they would give up constitutional ob∣ligation, because he believed a constitutional obligation was a moral one also.</P>
<P>There had been much difficulty, he said, with respect to moral obligation. The exercise of moral sense was put in the discrimination of the President and Senate, in their having made a treaty which gentlemen say binds that House to carry it into effect. He always understood that moral sense must reside in an agent. There was a re∣markable instance of it in Great Britain, and more re∣markable, because their King can do no wrong. This
<PB N="86" REF="030221_0018_0FE52879E3F04970"/>
brought him again to the word law. It was said they intended to repeal the treaty. No. They claimed a power to refuse the passing of a law—a mere negative power. When he was called upon to pass a law, was he to do it without consideration? Legislation necessari∣ly includes deliberation. It was the meaning of it. How then can a Legislature be addressed in this language, <Q>al∣though we acknowledge you are a legislative body, yet, in this case, you have no right to discuss the me∣rits of the treaty which you are to appropriate money to carry into effect,</Q> The gentleman from Connecticut, who was entitled to much praise for his ability and ingenuity, said he could exercise his opinion as a citizen upon the treaty, but not as a legislator. He could not enter into this distinction; for every opinion which he formed as a citizen, he held as a legislator. Gentlemen should consider that in passing a law, they were on legislative and not on executive ground. It ap∣peared to him that these opinions had been fostered by gentlemen who were in the habit of associating together, and considered to have more force than they will be found to possess. He had been told that pulpit orators were less able to support an argument than other men, from their dictatorial habits; and he believed the gentlemen who supported the arguments in favour of prerogative, though they appeared smooth and feasible, would find a difficul∣ty in supporting them.</P>
<P>They had been told it was unfair to make allusions to the British House of Commons.—The reference had been made for two purposes, viz, to shew the practicability and the use of the check insisted upon, as it is fully ac∣knowledged in that government. When prerogative was the question, those gentlemen who now oppose the appeal, are themselves the first to make it; and he did not ex∣pect that in the year 1796, the British House of Commons would have been acknowledged to possess greater privile∣ges than the Legislature of the United States; but this was the fact, that they were struggling for popular rights, and obliged to refer to Britain to strengthen their claim. He acknowledged that the British Constitution was made up of customs, but these were their Constitution equally with their written one. The clause of their Constitution which
<PB N="87" REF="030221_0019_0FE528492ECCAEB0"/>
forbids the drawing of money from the Treasury but by law, is copied from the English practice; but now an at∣tempt was made to wrest this privilege from their hands. If checks are necessary, said Mr. Giles, no danger can arise from multiplying them, but were the contrary doc∣trine to prevail, it would lead to this, that the President and Senate might reduce that House from the real and efficient, to mere formal guardians of the people.</P>
<P>It was said, that when a treaty is made by the Presi∣dent, with the approbation of two thirds of the Senate, it is the supreme law of the land, and they were bound to obey it. It should be recollected, that about three years ago, Congress was occupied in discussing the necessary measures to be pursued with respect to Great Britain. The House of representatives differed in opinion from the other branches. They deemed it advisable not to trust solely on the magnanimity of the king, nor to any of his other qualities; several regulations were proposed. What was done? Certain measures were agreed upon in that House, sent to the Senate, but there negatived by the presiding voice only. A negociator was then appointed, and the consequence has been found to be a treaty, which goes to an inhibition of the powers of that House, which gives a power to legislate against legislation. He would not say what evil consequences might arise from such an in∣strument. He only remarked upon the evil of a treaty making power, which would oblige that House to grant money to carry into effect measures which might be sub∣versive of the public interest.</P>
<P>The difference of opinion which he had mentioned, was not the only instance in which the Senate and that House disagreed in sentiment. He believed the Senate passed two or three bills to increase the military establish∣ment which were negatived by them. The doctrine of checks was fully illustrated. If, the President and Se∣nate can, by the association of a foreign power, legislate and bind their measures conclusively on that House, may they not go on to any extent? what security have the peo∣ple against such a power? the treaty in question is yet open for farther negociation. Suppose Great Britain on
<PB N="88" REF="030221_0020_0FE529B88B7CFE88"/>
pretence of guarding her frontier, were to send 10,000 troops into Canada; and suppose the United States were to raise 10,000 men to keep the Indians in order. Sup∣pose the thing was presented to that House, not for de∣liberation, but obedience, what could be done? how would this operate with respect to appropriation? the li∣mitation might be for ten or twenty years, they could not withhold appropriations, because, it is said, they are under a moral obligation to do it. Ought they not, then, to be cautious how they admitted the extravagant doctrine laid down? he asked what were the feelings of the people in general, on account of the injuries received from a fo∣reign nation? did they wish to rely upon the magnanimi∣ty of the British monarch? No; they wished a redress of grievances, not a surrender of rights or a concession of interests.</P>
<P>The doctrine espoused by gentlemen in opposition to this motion, would cut up all checks, all power of thinking in the legislative body on occasions where treaties inter∣fered. This was not all. Two of these gentlemen had asserted, that if that House went into a discussion of the treaty, it would be rebellion against the other authorities. What, said he, can justify such language? might it not be replied that they were destroying the liberties of their constituents, and so the debate end in abuse? gentlemen can have little respect for the opinions of those who dif∣fer from them in sentiment, who give way to such ex∣pressions. Another argument which had been a common place one, was, that the effect of any hindrance to carrying into effect this treaty, would be the disorganizing of the government. He supposed that the proposition before the House, with the negative vote insisted on, as the right of that assembly, was a sort of acquasortis which was to eat up the whole powers of government. Suppose, said he, there should be a vote that the treaty should not be carried into effect, would not that House go on with its business as usual? surely it would. There was not the least foundation for such assertions. They were mere clamour; a voice, and nothing besides. Whenever the different branches of government, instead of checking each other, coalefeed together, and confidence in the Ex∣ecutive is the only security for good government, the
<PB N="89" REF="030221_0021_0FE528C01D79F5A0"/>
system will be reduced indeed. But even then, the Ame∣rican people would not be intimidated by any military establishment; for, finding the inefficacy of proper checks in their government, they would unitedly resist any at∣tempt to deprive them of their liberties.</P>
<P>It was said that certain advantages were to be derived to the United States from the late treaty, but he knew not of what sort. And, he exclaimed, is the government of the United States brought to so low an ebb, as to be indebted to foreign nations for aid? if it was, he sup∣posed by and by new concessions would be made, for further services. But if it be once understood, that there is not sufficient merits in the government to secure the affections of the people, but that the President and Se∣nate must lean on Great Britain for support, to what a lamentable situation will the United States be reduced! he believed that if the doctrine attempted to be supported were to prevail, and by that means to destroy the pro∣vision of checks, the despotism of a President and twen∣ty Senators (he did not mean the present President and Senators) might operate to an association of Despotism, which, if ever effected, must be by coercive measures.</P>
<P>Mr. Giles said he might be mistaken, but there was certainly an attempt to establish principles leading to that end. He spoke of calumnies which had been spread abroad against him, but which he disdained to answer. He left his conduct to speak for him. If the public were to be led astray by declamations about war, disorganization and confusion, very little reliance could be placed on them. He concluded, by saying, that he hoped the importance of the subject, and his earnest wish to retain the wholesome provisions against the possibility of incroachments upon the liberties of the people, would be a sufficient apology for having so long engaged the attention of the com∣mittee.</P>
<P>The task of answering this artful speech fell to Mr. Sedgwick. How he acquitted himself the reader will see.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="030221_0022_0FE5292518B2F3C8"/>Mr. SEDGWICK (Massachusetts) said that after the length of time which had been consumed, and the talents which had been so ably exerted, in the discussion of this sub∣ject, he should not think himself authorised to call the attention of the committee, to any observations of his, but that he considered it in principle, and in its conse∣quences, as the most important question, which had ever been debated in this House. It was no less, than whe∣ther this House should, by construction and implication, extend its controuling influence to subjects which were expressly, and he thought exclusively, delegated by the people to another department of the Government. We had heretofore been warned emphatically against seizing on power, by construction and implication. He had known no instance, in which the caution which that warning en∣forced, deserved more attention than on the present occa∣sion.</P>
<P>It must, he said, have been foreseen by the author of the motion, that it would ultimately be contested on the present ground. No sufficient reason had been given as an object for the call. The various reasons which had been hinted at, had hardly been suggested, before they were respectively abandoned. It would be remembered, and indeed had been avowed, that a request such as the present, was in nature of a demand. That, it was true, if we had an authority on the subject of forming treaties, we had a right to all the means of exercising an intelli∣gent discretion; and the demand, of course, was well founded. But if we had no such authority, and we had none unless it could be discovered in the Constitution, then the demand had no good foundation on which it could rest, and was in his opinion, an attempt at seizing on power by usurpation.</P>
<P>He was perfectly sensible in how disagreeable an atti∣tude a man would stand, who should attempt to limit the extent of power, claimed by an assembly to which he should address himself. He had some of the most power∣ful inclinations of human nature to contend with. He felt the full force of the influence of this principle, as it would afford the cause of repulsion and resistance, to the arguments which he might submit. But having for∣med
<PB N="91" REF="030221_0023_0FE528C335E1B380"/>
an opinion, perfectly satisfactory to his own mind, from the best light which honest investigation could pro∣cure, he thought it a duty he owed his country and pos∣terity, a duty rendered more indispensable, from the ob∣ligations which were upon him to obey the will of the people, expressed in the Constitution of their government, which he had sworn to support, solemnly to declare that opinion and the reasons on which it was founded.</P>
<P>He in his conscience believed, that if the Constitution could operate the benefits its original institution intended, that if the government should be rendered adequate to the protection of liberty and the security of the people: it must be, by keeping its sevaral departments distinct, and within their prescribed limits. Hence that man would give as good evidence of republicanism, of virtue, of sin∣cere love of country, who should defend the executive in the exercise of his constitutional rights, as the man who should contend for any other department of govern∣ment. If either should usurp the appropriate powers of another, anarchy, confusion or despotism must ensue. The functions of the usurping power would not be legiti∣mate but their exercise, despotism. If the power of con∣trouling treaties was not in the House, the same spirit which might usurp it, might also declare the existence of the House perpetual and fill the vacancies as they should occur. The merits of the present question it seem∣ed to be agreed, depended on this right; it was of infi∣nite importance therefore to decide it justly.</P>
<P>It would be taken for granted that it would be con∣ceded, on all hands, that we were to resort to the Con∣stitution, to know the extent and limits of our power, and that if we found not there a clear evidence of its existence, we ought to abandon the exercise. It was certain we had not any express delegation to make or to controul the public will in any of our relations with fo∣reign nations. On the other hand we found it declared, that the President should <HI>have power to make treaties, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two thirds of the Senators present concurred.</HI> Treaties to attain the ends for which they were designed were from their nature supreme laws: but the Constitution had in ano∣ther
<PB N="92" REF="030221_0024_0FE5298B632B2898"/>
place declared, that treaties made under the authori∣ty of the United States should be supreme laws. Gen∣tlemen had said that it was not declared that treaties made by the <HI>President and Senate</HI> should have this effect; but those made under the <HI>authority of the United States.</HI> The question then recurred what treaties were made under the <HI>authority of the United States.</HI> The true answer un∣doubtedly was, treaties made by those, to whom the peo∣ple, by their Constitution, had delegated the power. The President, qualified as had been mentioned, had ex∣pressly and none else had such power. If we were to rest the subject here, it would seem to follow irresista∣bly, and to be incapable almost of higher proof, that whenever a compact was formed by the President, with a foreign nation, and had received the advice and con∣sent of the Senate, if it was of such a nature as to be properly denominated a treaty, all its stipulations would thereby and from that moment become "supreme laws."</P>
<P>That such had been the construction from the com∣mencement of the government to the promulgation of the British treaty, he believed, would be universally ad∣mitted; and but for that treaty, probably, never would have been denied. Did this afford no evidence, that the construction was a just one. Was the subject a less im∣portant one, its decision might be safely trusted on this ground. But all important as it was for the purpose of further investigation, it might be useful to consider the nature, extent, objects and effects of this power.</P>
<P>What authority was then delegated under a grant of power to form treaties; did not the term <HI>Treaty</HI> include all stipulations between independent nations, relative to subjects, in which the contracting parties, had a mutual or common interest? if it had a more confined or limited sense it became those who contended for it, to make the limits and designate the boundaries. Without a power so extensive, much of the benefits resulting from amicable intercourse, between independent nations, would be lost; and disputes and differences, which are inevitable, would have no means of amicable termination. From the ob∣vious utility and indeed the absolute necessity, that such power should be exercised, we know of no civilized na∣tion,
<PB N="93" REF="030221_0025_0FE528C4B8A1BDE0"/>
either ancient or modern, which had not provided the organs of negociation, to the extent substantially which he had mentioned. The power indispensible had always been delegated, though guards had been provided against its abuse by different means:</P>
<P>It was not now to be enquired, whether the power of treating was wisely deposited, (although he was inclined to believe it could not be intrusted to safer hands.) It was sufficient that those who had the right, the citizens of America, had declared their will, which we were bound to respect, because we had sworn to support it, and because we were their deputies.</P>
<P>The power of treating between independent nations might be classed under the following heads. 1. To com∣pose and adjust differences whether to terminate or to prevent war. 2. To form contracts for mutual security or defence; or to make treaties offensive or defensive. 3. To regulate an intercourse for mutual benefit, or to form treaties of commerce. Without the first war and con∣tention could only be terminated, by the destruction of one of the parties: without the second there could be no defence, by means of union and concurrence, against superior force, and without the last, a profitable and be∣neficial intercouse, could not be arranged on terms of re∣ciprocity. Hence, then, it must be evident to every un∣prejudiced mind, that by a grant of power to make trea∣ties, authority was given to bind the nation by stipulations to preserve peace or terminate war—to enter into alli∣ances offensive and defensive, and to form commercial treaties.</P>
<P>This power, he held, unlimited by the constitution, and he held, too, that in its nature, to the extent he had mentioned, it was illimitable. Did a serious difference exist with a foreign nation, in determining on the nature and extent of the stipulations which might be necessary to adjust it; the cause of injury—national rights and ho∣nour—the evils of war, and all circumstances of relation between the two countries, must be taken into account.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="030221_0026_0FE529AAE80E8058"/>In forming alliances, the threatened pressure, your own and your enemies relative strength, the objects of acqui∣sition or defence, must be considered. And in adjusting an equitable intercourse for commercial purposes, a thou∣sand circumstances present themselves for nice calcu∣lations. A thousand circumstances of foreign relations would occur in the history of every country, under which nothing short of unlimited powers of negociation would be adequate to a prevention of enormous perhaps ruinous evils.</P>
<P>But it might be objected that a power so enormous, and comprehending such essential interests might be abused, and thence asked, where is the remedy? to this he an∣swered, that a national association required, for the great purpose of preservation, an unlimited confidence on ma∣ny subjects. Hence not only this, but perhaps every other national government, had delegated to it, an unlimit∣ed controul over the persons and property of the nation. It might, by the express power given to it of raising ar∣mies, convert every citizen into a soldier, and by a single assessment of a tax, it might command the use of all the property in the country.</P>
<P>The power to raise armies and taxes was limited in its exercise by nothing but the discretion of the Legislature, under the direction of its prudence, wisdom and virtue. Was there no security against a wanton abuse of these enor∣mous powers? yes; it was to be hoped that the people in electing the members of this House, and the states in chusing those of the other, would not select characters, who regardless of the public good would wantonly impose on their constituents unnecessary burthens. It would be an additional security that the interests of the rulers, were inseparably connected, with those of the people— that they could impose no burthens in which themselves did not equally participate. But should all those guards be insufficient, was there no dependence to be placed in the President? the man elected by a refined process, pre-emi∣nent in fame and virtue as in rank? was there no secu∣rity in the watchful guardianship of such a character re∣sponsible by every thing dear and valuable to man—his reputation, his own and his fellow citizens happi∣ness?
<PB N="95" REF="030221_0027_0FE528F17888BF70"/>
was there no well founded reliance on all these considerations, for security against oppression? if not, we had not the requisite materials, with which to administer a republican government, and the project might be aban∣doned.—After all however, should the unlimited powers he had mentioned, and such powers must always be unli∣mited, be wantonly abused, was there no remedy? yes, in the good sense and manly independent spirit of the peo∣ple. If intolerable burthens were wantonly imposed, if necessary to defeat the oppression, opposition and insurrection would not only be authorized, but become a duty. And if any man could honestly lay his hand on his heart, and in sincerity declare, that a compliance with an existing treaty, was worth more than our government, our constitution, our union and the liberty protected by them; to that man he was ready to declare, that opposition had become a duty. Gentlemen had spoken of the subject, as if the members of this House were the only representatives of the people, as their only protectors against the usurpations and oppressions of the other departments of government. Who then he asked were the Senators? were they unfeel∣ing tyrants, whose interests were separated from and op∣posed to those of the people? No. Did they possess hereditary power and honours? No. Who, as contem∣plated by the constitution, were they? the most enlight∣ened and the most virtuous of our citizens. What was the source from whence they derive their elevation? from the confidence of the people, and the free choice of their electors. Who were those electors? not an ignorant herd, who could be cajoled, flattered and deceived, not even the body of the enlightened American citizens: but their legislatures—men to whom the real characters of the candidates would be known. For what purposes were they elected? to represent the most essential interests of their country—As the guardians of the sovereignty of the states, the happiness of the people and their liber∣ties—Who as contemplated by the constitution was the President? the man elected, by means intended to ex∣clude the operation of faction and ambition, as the one best entitled to public confidence and esteem—And was no confidence to be reposed in such characters, thus elect∣ed? might it not, to say no more, be at least doubtful whe∣ther
<PB N="96" REF="030221_0028_0FE529AC69DD9720"/>
the treating power might not be as safely intrusted in such hands exclusively, as with the participation and un∣der the controul of the more numerous branch of the le∣gislature, elected in small districts, assailed by party and faction, and exposed to influence and intrigue? whatever merits this as an original question might possess, the people had decided their will. To the President and Se∣nate they have given powers to make treaties, they have given no such powers to this House.</P>
<P>It was not in his opinion, proper when investigating the constitutional question of the extent of a particular power and in what hands it was deposited, to divert the attention to a possible abuse of that power. Should it become a question whether Congress was by the consti∣tution authorised to raise armies, and the extent to which the power might be exercised, it would be unfair and improper to divert the attention from the enquiry of what was the truth, to the abuse which might result from the exercise of the power—To state that if such power existed, every citizen might by the wanton abuse of it, be degraded from his rank and subjected to the despotism of a military discipline. To shew that armies might be em∣ployed as the instruments of destroying liberty—To picture your country as strewed with human carcasses and stained with human blood by their means. What would this be but to substantiate prejudices instead of arguments? still however it would remain true, that the power of Con∣gress to raise armies, was only limited, by its discretion, under the direction of wisdom and patriotism. The same observations changing their relations, may with equal justness be applied to the treaty making power. To be, and continue a nation, required on these subjects unlimit∣ed confidence in the delegation of the necessary powers. The people had granted them and provided, against their abuse, such guard as their wisdom dictated.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madison) had stated five different constructions which possibly might be given to the constitution on this subject. Three of which (and for none of them to Mr. Sedgwick's knowledge had any man ever contended) the gentleman had proved to be unsound∣ed. The fourth, that which we had given to the consti∣tution,
<PB N="97" REF="030221_0029_0FE529CA10A5BFD0"/>
if admitted, and it should be abused might pro∣duce mischievous effects. Was not this true of all the great and essential powers of government? if the con∣trouling influence of the House was added would the pow∣er be less? and if under these circumstances, abused would the injury be more tolerable? in short was not this a kind of argument infinitely more tending to the pro∣duction of prejudice than to the discovery of truth?</P>
<P>The gentleman had really given no decisive opinion what was the true construction. He had however seemed to incline to a belief, that to the stipulation of a treaty relative to any subject committed to the controul of the Legislature, to give it validity, legislative co-operation was necessary. Of consequence if this was withheld, the operation of the treaty would be defeated. That it was at the will and within the discretion of the Legisla∣ture to withhold such co-operation, and of course the House might controul and defeat the solemn engagements of the President and Senate.</P>
<P>The gentleman who had suggested this opinion was well known to the committee and through America. Mr. Sedgwick could not but observe, that it was per∣fectly unaccountable to his mind, that that gentleman had yet to form an opinion to whom was delegated that power, the nature, extent and effects of which he had so strongly and perspicuously detailed. The capacity of that gentleman's mind, long exercised on political sub∣jects, his known caution and prudence, would authorize a request, that he or his friends would explain, how it was possible, if such as he states should have been the intention of those who framed the Constitution, that the true meaning should not have been expressed in the in∣struments? that when the gentleman went from the As∣sembly which framed the Constitution, immediately after∣wards to one of those which ratified it; he should have admit∣ted an opposite construction. As Mr. Sedgwick would under∣take by and by to prove that in the Convention of Virginia he did admit the very construction for which we now contended. He would take the liberty further to enquire, how it happen∣ed that if such was really the intention of the instrument, that such was the meaning of the people, no man had
<PB N="98" REF="030221_0030_0FE529CCD0C47718"/>
heard of it, until the discovery was produced, by the British treaty? strange national intention unknown for years, to every individual!—As the gentleman had been pleased to dwell on the idea of a co-operation between the powers of the government, he would take the liber∣ty to state what had been ably explained by other gentle∣men, that the power of making treaties was wholly dif∣ferent from that of making ordinary laws, originating from different motives, producing different effects and operating to a different extent. In all those particulars the difference had been perfectly understood. For in∣stance the ordinary legal protection of property and the punishment of its violation could never be extended be∣yond your own jurisdiction, but by treaty, the same pro∣tection could be extended within the jurisdiction of a foreign government. You could not legislate an adjust∣ment of disputes, nor a peace with another country, but by treaty both might be effected. Your laws in no in∣stance could operate except in your own jurisdiction, and on your own citizens; by treaty an operation was given to stipulations, within the jurisdiction of both the contract∣ing parties.</P>
<P>It had been said that treaties would not operate on those subjects which were consigned to legislative con∣troul. "If this be true," said he, <Q>how impotent in this respect is the power of the government? what, then permit me to enquire can the power of treating effect? I will tell you what it cannot do—it can make no alliances, because any stipulations for offensive or defensive operations will infringe on the legislative pow∣er of declaring war, laying taxes or raising armies or all of them. No treaty of peace can probably be made which will not either ascertain boundaries, stipulate privileges to aliens, the payment of money or a cession of territory, and certainly no treaty of commerce can be made.</Q></P>
<P>Was it not strange that to this late hour it should have been delayed, and that now all at once it should have been discovered, that no power was delegated to any bo∣dy to regulate our foreign relations? that although a power was granted to the President and Senate to form
<PB N="99" REF="030221_0031_0FE528C63B7E5CA8"/>
treaties, that yet there were such reservations and restrict∣ions, that there remained nothing on which this power could operate? or was it true that this power, was com∣petent to treat with every government on earth but that of Great Britain? might he not be permitted further to enquire if this treaty had been formed with any other power, with the precise stipulations it now contained, whether there ever could have existed this doubt of con∣stitutionality?</P>
<P>We had, he said, entered into treaties of commerce with many nations, we had formed an alliance and en∣tered into a guarantee with France, we had gived consul∣ar power including judicial authority to the citizens of that country, within our own jurisdiction, we had defin∣ed piracies and provided for their punishment, we have removed the disabilities of alienage, we had granted sub∣sidies and ceded territory: all this and much more we had done, while the power of the government remained unquestioned and none even thought that such treaties re∣quired legislative co-operation. Treaties such as those could without opposition and by unanimous consent be ratified and considered by force of such ratification as su∣preme laws; but similar stipulations with Great Britain, were clearly perceived to be unconstitutional, and Presi∣dent, Envoy and Senate were denounced for their re∣spective agency as infractors of the constitution.</P>
<P>The objection which he had just answered had been brought forward by a gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gallatin] with another nearly allied to it, if not resting on precisely the same foundation—that whatever stipula∣tion in a treaty required legislative provision or repealed a law, did not become a supreme law, until it had received le∣gislative sanction. There was no limitation expressed in the constitution on which to found either of those objections. If we claimed the power which the objections imported the claim must rest on construction and implication alone. In∣deed the whole reasoning of the gentlemen seemed to him to be capable of being expressed in a few words. <Q>The President and Senate, in the sole and uncontrouled exercise of the treaty making power, may sacrifice the most important interests of the people. The House
<PB N="100" REF="030221_0032_0FE528F31F59D160"/>
of Representative is more worthy the public confi∣dence, and therefore by our influence we will pre∣vent the abuse of power.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman, to prove his position stated that the power of treating in Great Britain and the United States is precisely the same. He then had read a passage from Judge Blackstone <Q>that the sovereign power of treat∣ing with foreign nations was vested in the person of the king, and that any contract he engaged in, no power in the kingdom could delay, resist or annul.</Q> At the same time he said that certain treaties, such as those of subsidy and commerce were not binding until ratified by parliament. Now both these could not be true; for it was no less than a direct contradiction in terms to say, that there was no power in the nation which could de∣lay, resist or annul the contracts of the king, and at the same time to say, there was a power in the nation. The parliament, which could delay, resist and annul those contracts. Both the assertions could not be true. He was willing however to allow that the treaties which the gentlemen had mentioned were not the supreme laws of that country until approved by the legislature. He had already said that different countries had provided different guards, against the abuse of this power. But why attempt to divert our attention from a construction of our own constitution, to the vague uncertain customs and practices of other countries? why compare the Pre∣sident and Senate to the king of Great Britain? in what was there a resemblance? in nothing. Why then perplex the subject by the introduction of irrelative matter? was there perceived an interest in a diversion from the only le∣gitimate source of information the declared will of the peo∣ple? if we found not there the power we claimed, we could exercise it only by usurpation.</P>
<P>Why did not gentlemen extend their reasoning further? where in point of principle was the difference between restraining and controuling the legislative power? the in∣jury may be as great in the one instance as in the other; nor is there any more foundation for denying to the Pre∣sident and Senate the power in the one case than in the other, from any words or expressions in the constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="030221_0033_0FE529D374D350C0"/>If the gentlemen are right in their construction, if this was the understanding of the people at the time they de∣liberated on and ratified the constitution, the power of the President and Senate of making treaties which then created the most serious deliberation and alarming ap∣prehension was the most innocent thing in nature. It could bind the essential interests of the nation in nothing. Could any man really believe that the agitation which a discussion of this subject occasioned, more perhaps than any other in the constitution, could have for its object only the power of the President and Senate, in which two thirds of the latter must concur, to digest schemes of treaties to be laid before the legislature for its appro∣bation?</P>
<P>The gentleman from New York (Mr. Havens) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) had asserted the power of the legislature to repeal treaties—whenever the wisdom of Congress should concur in opinion, with these gentlemen we should then cease to contend respecting the construction of the constitution on this subject. For whenever our nation should in defiance of every principle of morality and common honesty, by usurpation establish its right, to prostrate national honor, by sporting with the public faith, no nation would submit to be contaminated by a connexion with one which avowed the right of viola∣ting its faith by the infraction of solemn treaties.</P>
<P>On all subjects of this sort the real enquiry was and ought to be, what was the intention of the parties to this instrument. Hence a brief review of some interesting oc∣currences, which took place at the adoption of the go∣vernment would not be impertinent, but might be useful.</P>
<P>A cotemporaneous exposition of any instrument, and especially by those who were agents in its fabrication, had been allowed, and was in fact among the best guides to finding its true meaning. Gentlemen who had been members of the convention, and unfriendly to the con∣stitution, with an intention of preventing its adoption, had stated to their constituents that the power of making treaties as consided to the President and Senate was as ex∣tensive as was now contended for. Their intention would
<PB N="102" REF="030221_0034_0FE529639A443670"/>
have been no other than to alarm the people with the dan∣gerous extent and what would be the pernicious exercise of this power. If this charge was unjust and groundless, what would have have been the conduct of the friends of that instrument? they would have proved the charge mali∣cious and ill founded. They would have shewn that the con∣stitution was not liable to such an objection. That it could bear no such construction. They would in the language of novel discovery have said, that every subject of legisla∣tion, was an exception from the power of making treaties; and thus they would have proved to the world, that the sages of our country, had devised and offered to their en∣lightened countrymen a scheme of government destitute, by an express delegation, of the the essential attribute of adjusting differences with other nations; and of agreeing with them on the terms of amicable intercourse. But they did no such thing—they admitted the power, proved the necessity of it and contended that it would be safe in practice. <Q>Let me here, said he, appeal to any unpre∣judiced man, if he can possibly believe that the ene∣mies of the constitution could have made the charge against it, and that its friends would have admitted the truth of it, on the hypothesis that it was unfounded and false.</Q> They certainly knew what they had so recent∣ly intended, and having opposite objects in view which ex∣cited their strongest wishes, it was impossible they should agree in imposing on the people a false and unwarranta∣ble construction. So far had he extended his reflections as resulting from the conduct of those who formed the constitution; a conduct from which he flattered himself there flowed demonstration, that the power of making treaties was as extensive as that which was now contended for. This being the concurrence of men who could not have united to deceive, with regard to which it was im∣possible they should be mistaken, formed a guide for their opinion, which could not mislead, which no degree of stupidity could mistake, nor the most ingenious sophistry successfully misrepresent.</P>
<P>So much he had thought proper to say as respected the construction given to this part of the instrument by those who formed, who could not mistake, and who were un∣der no temptation to misrepresent it. It might be necessa∣ry
<PB N="103" REF="030221_0035_0FE528F4A3FD70A0" MS="y"/>
in the next place enquire under what opinion it was adopted? and if we perceived a correspondence of construc∣tion between those who formed and those who received and approved; we might then surely derive all reasonable sa∣tisfation that we had discovered the truth. Here he be∣lieved that it might be asserted without any danger of con∣tradiction, that in the state conventions it was on one hand affirmed, that the President and Senate would, by the constitution have power to form treaties on any sub∣ject in which the United States and a foreign nation had a common interest, and that treaties so formed without any other aid or circumstance whatever, would thereby become the supreme law of the land: and that the exer∣cise of this power was not so guarded as to render, it safe to the public interests. On the other hand, it was admit∣ted that such was the extent of the power, and it was at∣tempted, at least, to be proved, that it was so guarded that danger could not reasonably be apprehended, from its exercise. It would be too tedious and well might be thought unnecessary to consult all the materials, which might be within our reach on this subject: but he dared appeal to the recollection of every gentleman, who was in a situation to know the facts, for the correctness of the statement which he had made, and he would read some few passages, from the debates of the convention of Vir∣ginia, which would probably be on this occasion, for ma∣ny reasons admitted, as the best authority; and particu∣larly because the subject, there was examined by eminent and scrupulous investigation.</P>
<P>He then read several passages to prove the statement which he had made, and said, the construction he contended for was assented to by a solemn act of the convention which proposed an amendment, which he also read, which would be wholly unnecessary on any other hypothesis; and that by the late conduct of the same state, in the amendment proposed to the con∣stitution, it was manifest that it still entertained the same opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK, in the course of his speech, read the following extracts from the third volume of <Q>debates and proceedings of the Convention of Virginia.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="030221_0036_0FE529C88EC77E38"/>Mr. MASON, <Q>thought this a most dangerous clause. By the confederation, nine states were necessary to con∣cur in a treaty. This secured justice and moderation. His principal fear however, was not that five but seven states, a bare majority, would make treaties, to bind the union.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. NICHOLAS said, <Q>the approbation of the President, who had no local views, being elected by no parti∣al state, but the people at large, was an additional se∣curity.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MADISON <Q>thought it astonishing, that gentlemen should think a treaty should be got with surprise, or that foreign nations should be solicitous to get a treaty ratified by the senators of a few states—that should the President summon only a few states, he would for so atrocious a thing be impeachable.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. HENRY, <Q>If two thirds of a quorum would be empowered to make a treaty, they might relinquish and alienate territorial rights, and our most valuable com∣mercial advantages; in short, if any thing should be left, it would be because the President and Senate were pleased to admit it." The power of making treaties was ill guarded, as it extended farther than it did in any country in the world. "Treaties were to have more force here than in any part of christendom.</Q></P>
<P>(How, Mr. Sedgwick asked, could this be true, if the doctrine now laid down, in support of the motion, was well founded?)</P>
<P>Mr. MADISON. <Q>Are not treaties the law of the land in England? I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand—Blackstone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties made by the king, are to be the supreme laws of the land. If they are to have any efficacy they must be the laws of the land. They are so in every country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="030221_0037_0FE528D374EA99B0"/>Gov. RANDOLPH. <Q>It is said there is no limitation of treaties. I defy the wisdom of that gentleman to shew how they ought to be limited.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. NICHOLAS. <Q>Have we not seen in America that treaties were violated, though they are in all countries considered as the supreme laws of the land?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MASON. <Q>It is true, that it is one of the greatest acts of sovereignty, and therefore ought to be most strongly guarded. The cession of such power without such checks and guards cannot be justified—yet I ac∣knowledge such a power must be somewhere. It is so in all governments. If in the course of an unsuc∣cessful war, we should be compelled to give up part of our territories, or undergo subjugation, if the general government could not make a treaty to give up such a part, for the preservation of the residue, the govern∣ment itself, and consequently the rights of the people must fall. Such a power must therefore rest some∣where. For my part, I never heard it denied that such a power must be vested in the government. Our com∣plaint is that it is not sufficiently guarded, and that it requires much more solemnity and caution, than are delineated in that system.</Q></P>
<P>(Strange, Mr. Sedgwick said, that this gentleman did not discover, or was not told, that treaties before they should become laws, must receive legislative sanction!)</P>
<P><Q>There are other things which the king of England cannot do, which may be done by the President and Senate in this case. Could the king by his prerogative enable foreign subjects to purchase lands, and have an hereditary indefeasible title? will any gentleman say, that they (the President and Senate) may not make a treaty, whereby the subjects of France, England and other powers may buy what lands they please in this country? the President and Senate can make any trea∣ty whatsoever. We wish not to refuse but to guard this power, as it is done in England. We wish an explicit declaration in that paper, that the power which can make other treaties cannot without the consent of the
<PB N="106" REF="030221_0038_0FE529D642AE62D8"/>
national parliament, the national legislature, dismember the empire. The Senate alone ought not to have this power.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. CORBIN (who was in favour of the constitution) <Q>If there be any found part in the constitution, it is in this clause. The representatives are excluded from in∣terposing in making treaties, because large popular as∣semblies are very improper to transact such business, from the impossibility of their acting with sufficient se∣crecy, dispatch and decision, which can only be found in small bodies, and are always subject to factions and party animosities. It would be dangerous to give this power to the President alone, as the concession of such a power to one individual, is repugnant to republican principles. It is therefore given to the President and Senate (who represent the states in their individual capa∣cities) conjointly. In this it differs from every govern∣ment we know. It steers with admirable dexterity be∣tween the two extremes—neither leaving it to the exe∣cutive as in most other governments, nor to the legis∣lature, which would too much retard such negociations.</Q></P>
<P>That another member of the convention, Mr. Henry, after contending, that the constitution ought to be amend∣ed, so as to guard against the abuse of the treaty making power, by requiring the consent of the House, concluded his observations by saying:</P>
<P><Q>That when <HI>their</HI> consent is necessary there will be a certainty of attending to the public interests.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MADISON concluded this interesting debate, not by insisting on that security, which he had now discovered the constitution to have provided against the abuse of this power: he stated:</P>
<P><Q>That the power was precisely in the new constitu∣tion as it was in the confederation.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman stated the checks which the constituti∣on had in fact provided, but it did not then occur to him, that the consent of this House was amongst them.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="030221_0039_0FE529D7C72D72B8"/>Mr. Sedgwick then read the amendment which the convention of Virginia proposed to the constitution.</P>
<P><Q>That no commercial treaty shall be ratified without the concurrence of two thirds of the whole number of the Se∣nate; and no treaty ceding, controuling, restraining, or suspending, territorial rights or claims of the United States or any of them, or their or any of their rights or claims to fishing in the American sea, or navigat∣ing the American rivers, shall be made but in cases of the most urgent necessity; nor shall any such treaty be ratified without the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both Houses respectively.</Q></P>
<P>He had stated that the real inquiry was, what opinion was entertained on this subject by those who ratified the constitution? if that opinion would be discovered with honest minds, it must be conclusive on the present debate. He had shewn what opinion was entertained by Virgi∣nia—what power she meant to delegate and to whom. That this opinion remained from that time until she pro∣posed her late amendments, unaltered, appeared from the amendments themselves. That state, then, and her repre∣sentatives here, who had expressed themselves, differed in opinion. He did not mention Virginia with intention of producing any unpleasant sensations. He was willing to allow that she was great, wise, intelligent, enlightened, and if gentlemen pleased, <HI>moral;</HI> her opinion derived additional authority from her respectability.—It was not Virginia alone, but he was persuaded every other state, had given precisely the same construction.—<HI>That the treaty making power with all its effects and consequences, was solely and exclusively in the President and Senate:</HI> And he would dare to challenge gentlemen to produce a solitary instance of its being adopted under any other idea. Indeed, the agita∣tion which was at that time produced, would of all things be the most ridiculous, if any of the other constructi∣ons were true. If the power was checked as was now con∣tended, it was impossible danger should be apprehended from its exercise—it could indeed do neither good nor evil.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="030221_0040_0FE4FE60906DB040"/>Here then he said we had the evidence of those who framed and of those who received and approved the con∣stitution. There was another source of enquiry, which would confirm if it wanted confirmation, that construc∣tion for which he had contended. It was the construct∣ion which had been, practically given, by those who had administered our government, from the commence∣ment of our foreign relations, to the present session—a construction which had been assumed, admitted or acquies∣ed in, by our national and state governments and by every individual citizen until they received new light, by our having accomodated our causes of contention with Great Britain and escaped the evils with which we had been threatened from that source.</P>
<P>The association which preceded any express contract between the states, was supposed to imply an authority to form national compacts, imposing national obligations, and pledging the public faith. Hence our treaty with France, which preceded two years our national associati∣on, the confederation, had been supposed binding on us, and not only obliging us to the faithful performance of our express engagements, but as drawing after it undefin∣ed, unlimited and perpetual obligations of gratitude. This seemed so far as respected defined obligations, to be a ra∣tional deduction from what is an inseparable attendant on national associations, and without which a nation would be destitute, of one of the best means of securing its hap∣piness and even existence,</P>
<P>To pursue, he said, the history of our country on this subject, in the order of time, it would not be pretended that under the confederation, the powers of Congress to form "treaties and aiiiances" were more extensive than those of the President and Senate under the constitution to form "treaties." The legislative powers of the nati∣on, then residing with the several states, were as obstruc∣tive to the operation of treaties (and extended to all the objects which the national and state legislatures now com∣prehended) as the congressional legislature can now be. Yet under the confederation treaties of alliance, of peace, of commerce, were made, nor until the present moment has their obligation been denied, though they contained
<PB N="109" REF="030221_0041_0FE528D4F8416DA0"/>
stipulations, perhaps, on all the subjects to which the treating power could extend. No legislative provision had been thought necessary to give them validity; and he dared appeal to every member of the committee, that eve∣ry enlightened citizen had admitted their binding obliga∣tion as supreme laws—that the treaty of peace in particu∣lar, which controuled the most important rights of sove∣reignty—arrested the hand of justice in inflicting punish∣ment for the highest crime which a citizen could commit, treason—and stayed proceedings in cases of confiscation, for forfeitures which had been incurred had always received this construction—He would add that it was well under∣stood to be the opinion of that tribunal which the consti∣tution had authorised to pronounce the law the supreme court; that the treaty, <HI>from its own powers</HI> repealed all antecedent laws, which stood in the way of its execution.</P>
<P>To proceed further on. Since the adoption of the con∣stitution, the powers now denied, had been constantly ex∣ercised with all the consequences and effects now contend∣ed for and until the present moment unquestioned. Peace had been concluded, subsidies granted, payment of money stipulated, territorial rights discussed and decided on. Trea∣ties for those purposes had been ratified, not by venal and corrupt majorities, but by <HI>virtuous</HI> unanimity. Hence from the moment we had become a nation, under every form of our implied or expressed association, the powers now denied had been exercised, not only without questi∣on but with unqualified approbation.</P>
<P>There was one more point of light in which this sub∣ject ought to be viewed. In the year 1789, it was pro∣posed to discriminate in the imposition of our duties, be∣tween the nations with whom we had, and those with whom we had not treaties of commerce. The author of this proposition renewed the same in the year 1794. This was virtually acknowledging the validity of the treaties which did exist, and inviting those nations who had not already, to form commerical treaties. Something more than this was done by the motions which some gentlemen of the minority of the Senate, are said to have made when this very treaty was in discussion. Their motions recom∣mended an accomodation by treaty of all subsisting dif∣ferences
<PB N="110" REF="030221_0042_0FE528F62687C500"/>
between the two countries. It could not escape remark, that these several propositions and motions were supported by all that description of persons who now op∣pose the treaty.</P>
<P>It would not then be deemed impertinent to enquire, it was worthy attention, what was imported and admitted by this conduct and by those propositions? they undoubt∣edly implied a concession that the subsisting treaties were of validity; why else should they be considered as a me∣ritorious cause of favourable discriminations? they impli∣ed, too, that there existed in this country a power to treat on commerical relations, and to adjust subsisting dif∣ferences.</P>
<P>If without legislative aid (and they had received none) those treaties would authorise the legislature to derange the commerical pursuits of the nation, and enter in legis∣lative hostility with that nation with which we had the most extensive relations; it must be from the competen∣cy of the treaty making power on the principles which we contended. Strange again he would say, it must ap∣pear, that the true construction of the constitution, on this very important subject, should have escaped the pe∣netration and segacity, of the author of those propositions, during the time of forming and ratifying the instrument, and his whole active public life from those periods, until that of the publication of the British treaty.</P>
<P>If, then, it was true, as he had endeavoured to prove, by that power, given by the constitution, to the Presi∣dent and Senate, to make treaties they had an authority to the extent he supposed, with all its consequences and effects. If treaties so formed did in fact become the supreme law, then being compacts they bound the public saith and could not be violated without national disgrace and perso∣nal dishonour. They might require legislative provision, to carry them into effect; but this neither implied nor authorized the exercise of discretion, as to refused. The constitution he had, frequent occasions of saying, pre∣scribed a government of departments. Each was intended to be furnished with the means of self preservation and de∣fence. For this purpose it was declared, that the President
<PB N="111" REF="030221_0043_0FE52904008B0DA8"/>
would receive, a compensation to be ascertained by law. Laws were to be made by the legislature, of which this House was one branch. To support the constitution each depart∣ment must be enabled to perform the functions assigned to it. To enable the executive to do its duties, the compensation must be provided. It was then necessary to the support of the constitution, that the compensation should be made. We had sworn to support the constitution. The people by their constitution had solemnly engaged that whoever was the president, should receive a compensation. We had been deputed to discharge the duties and engagements which our constituents had assumed. Under these cir∣cumstances no man of common honesty could declare that we were at liberty to refuse all provision.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madison) had attempted to take a distinction between the duties we had imposed on us by the constitution and such as were enjoined by law. He could perceive no such foundation for a distinction. After the salary of the President was ascertained by law, it could not be paid without an appropriation; would any one say he was at liberty to withhold it? No man he presumed would wish to risk his reputation by such an assertion. For such conduct instead of supporting would tend to subvert, and would if persisted in, annihilate the constitution. This was un∣doubtedly one of the most important of the public con∣tracts; the truth was, in fact, that we were bound to perform all the public engagements. The truth was, that our national association was a compact of virtue. To support the constitution it was necessary to preserve pub∣lic faith—to promote the public happiness it was essential to hold sacred and to perform the public engagements. In this were included all engagements whether expressed in the form of constitution, of laws, or of treaties, in any way, indeed, in which the people had agreed that their will and their duties might be expressed.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK concluded by observing that he had in∣tended to have presented the subject in several other im∣portant aspects, but he had already trespassed on the pa∣tience of the committee. He would, as the time of ad∣journment
<PB N="112" REF="030221_0044_0FE5296005C68018"/>
was passed, suspend for the present any further observations; and he hoped that all the grounds which he had left unoccupied, could be taken by other gentle∣men, so as to supercede the necessity of troubling the com∣mittee with any further observations on this subject.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="commentary">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The resolution finally passed, fifty five against thirty seven. A committee was accordingly ap∣pointed to wait on the President with the same; and, on the 31st of March the House received his refusal of the papers. His message was in his usual perspicuous and manly stile, and concluded in the following words: <Q>As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding, that the assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty: as the treaty with Great Britain exhi∣bits, in itself, all the objects requiring legislative provision; and on these the papers called for can throw no light; and as it is essential to the due administration of the government, that the boundaries fixed by the constitution, between the different departments should be preserved,—a just regard to the constitution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circumstances of this case, forbid a compliance with your request.</Q></P>
<P>In my remarks on this debate, I shall confine myself to the call for the papers, the debate on the treaty itself furnishing the best opportunity of re∣marking on the participation of the House in the treaty making power.</P>
<P>There is nobody will deny, that the House of Representatives have <HI>a right</HI> to call for papers of every kind, relative to matters laid before them; nor will any one deny, that the President has an
<PB N="113" REF="030221_0045_0FE529280D9FEE28"/>
equal <HI>right</HI> to refuse them. The necessity of the call can alone render it justifiable in point of propriety, and, consequently, if no such necessity exists, a refusal on the part of the President can∣not be improper.</P>
<P>Three reasons were urged in favour of the call: 1. something might be discovered that would justify an impeachment; 2. the papers might throw light on some parts of the treaty; 3. they might contain something, which would tend to reconcile the peo∣ple to that instrument.</P>
<P>With respect to the first of these; <HI>discovering grounds for an impeachment,</HI> I would ask, who could have been the object of this impeachment? not the Negociator certainly; for, whatever might be his conduct at the court of London, it had receiv∣ed the solemn sanction of the President and Senate. He was charged with powers to make a treaty, he had done so, and those who had dispatched him, had approved and ratified the result of his negoci∣ation; if, therefore, there was any blame, it must fall on those unders whose orders he acted, and not on him.</P>
<P>I presume the idea of impeaching the Senate never entered the brains of even Virginians, and of course the President must be the object. How an impeachment of General Washington will sound in the ears of others I know not, in mine it sounds extremely harsh; and, when I compare him with those who had the effrontery to start the idea, it is with difficulty I refrain from breaking through that respect, which is due to the assembly into which they have found the means to insinuate themselves. That <HI>they</HI> did not expect to find something that would furnish grounds of impeachment I will not
<PB N="114" REF="030221_0046_0FE5290600B0BE18"/>
pretend to aver, for men are but too apt to judge of others by themselves; but the only answer that such a slanderous insinuation merits from us, is, silent contempt.</P>
<P>But, <HI>the papers might throw light on some parts of the treaty.</HI> Now, I, who am no states-man, God-knows, have read this treaty, and I think I under∣stand it perfectly well. It is in good plain English, and, though that may be one of its principal faults with the quibblers from the south, yet it ought to render explanatory papers unnecessary. Will any one of the Opposition members say, that he does not understand the treaty? if he says so, will it not be necessary to send him back to his constituents, or furnish him with an interpreter? I confess that the outlandish gentlemen, such as Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> for example, may experience serious difficulties on this account; but is this to authorize a call that would divulge all the secrets of the state? would it not be infinitely better to have the treaty translated into <HI>Italian,</HI> or, like the French decrees of fraternity, into all the living languages? besides, let it be re∣membered, that the papers called for are in English as well as the treaty, and of course, those who do not understand the latter would not understand the former.</P>
<P>I would by no means insinuate here, that all the Opposition members, who are not foreigners, are adequate to a full comprehension of the treaty; for, though, like the <HI>Bourgois Gentilhomme,</HI> they talk tolerable good prose, without knowing it, their speeches fully prove that they know but little of the merits of the treaty. And, to them, as to foreigners the same question will apply: if they can∣not understand the treaty, how are they to under∣stand
<PB N="115" REF="030221_0047_0FE5298E39E409B0"/>
the papers? most people, I believe, will al∣low, that a diplomatic correspondence is more dif∣ficult to analyse than the instrument in question, and, if so, how is it possible that these contracted minds should derive light from such a correspon∣dence?</P>
<P>Some of the members of opposition are, how∣ever, of a different stamp. These did not want light. They are blessed with that in the extreme degree. The rays strike on their minds with such force as to blind every principle of honour and honesty. From the finesse of these gentlemen what could have been expected for the papers? that pro∣found politician patriot <HI>Madison</HI> found out <HI>five</HI> dif∣ferent constructions of one single clause of the con∣stitution, and perhaps he would have found five times the number of every clause in the dispatches. Where or when could this have ended?</P>
<P>It is something truely astonishing that papers, or any thing else, should, at this late hour, be called for, in order to throw light on the British treaty. There have been, upon a moderate computation, more than fifty volumes in folio written and printed on the subject; public meetings have been held on it in every corner of the Union; petitions by hun∣dreds have been given in for and against it; and the instrument itself has been in the hands of every one during the space of eight months. Where, then, do these people come from, who now want papers to throw light on the subject; if, indeed, they can prove, that they have been buried in the western woods, plotting "political sins" anew, or constantly occupied in driving their negro <HI>consti∣tuents</HI> to the tobacco fields and home again, I shall be ready to make an allowance for their ignorance;
<PB N="116" REF="030221_0048_0FE529AF3A94B828"/>
but, if they cannot prove this, if they have enjoy∣ed the same means of information as those enjoyed by every man in the <HI>free</HI> States, and are yet igno∣rant of the merits or demerits of the treaty, I must absolutely declare them too stupid to judge of it at all, and totally unworthy of having an intricate dip∣lomatic correspondence submitted to their examina∣tion.</P>
<P>But, allowing that the papers might have thrown light on some parts of the treaty, how was this ne∣cessary to their deciding on granting the supplies necessary to carry it into effect; for, it is for this purpose alone that a treaty is laid before them. We will suppose, for a moment, that they had dis∣covered that Mr. Jay had gone beyond, or fallen short of, his instructions; nay, we will even suppose, that they had found as indubitable proofs of English corruption, as they have had of French corruption; how could that circumstance have affected their de∣cision? If they have a right of exercising their judg∣ment with respect to a treaty, it must be on the treaty itself, and that was before them. The means em∣ployed in the negociation could not alter the in∣strument itself. It has a precise meaning, couched in terms which cannot be misunderstood, and on that meaning alone could they found their decision. What an ideot of a connoisseur should we think him, who, upon the sight of a picture, should call for the pencils and colours with which it was paint∣ed, in order to form an opinion of its merits. Yet, exactly such was the call for papers relative to the treaty.</P>
<P>There was, however, another reason assigned: <HI>these papers might contain something, which would tend to reconcile the people to the instrument.</HI> I could
<PB N="117" REF="030221_0049_0FE529319F4C7B50"/>
have excused every thing but this gross, this palpa∣ble hypocrisy. What! did these opposition mem∣bers desire to see something that would reconcile the people to the treaty! these very men who had, in ways more or less direct, stipulated with the mob to oppose it. It is a fact well known, that the lea∣ders among them had all written or made public speeches representing it as inimical to the rights and liberties of the people; the gentleman who brought forward the resolution was one of those who took the lead at New York, when the <HI>French</HI> and Ame∣rican flags were hoisted against it, and when it was absolutely burnt before the house of Governor Jay. And yet, these very men now pretend, that they wish for something that may reconcile the people to it! what an opinion must they have of the President, to suppose him open to such barefaced deception; when men have long succeeded in this, or any way, they are apt to over rate their talents; it is not therefore so very wonderful, that they should imagine it as easy to cajole General Wash∣ington as their deluded constituents.</P>
<P>I have now done with the <HI>pretended</HI> motives of the resolution (on which I must confess I have ta∣ken up too much of the reader's time) and shall come to what I imagine to be the <HI>real</HI> motives of it.</P>
<P>To begin at the fountain head, the mind from which the mischievous and malicious idea first issu∣ed, it is tolerably well known, that the <HI>Livingstons</HI> harbour a mortal hatred against the family of his Excellency Governor <HI>Jay,</HI> which hatred is undoubt∣edly paid back with contempt. The characters of the parties sufficiently explain the cause. This is not the first instance of private resentment finding
<PB N="118" REF="030221_0050_0FE5293321E3F6E0"/>
its way into public assemblies. Something in these papers might have been found which, if properly handled, would have impressed on the minds of the ignorant, a belief that Mr. Jay had abandoned their interests; that he was partial to the English nation (which alone is a sufficient crime) and that he felt little anxiety for the success of the French. The slightest expression, leaning this way, would have been tortured into the most odious significati∣on by men who are capable of finding five differ∣ent constructions of a simple sentence. There could not be imagined a more complete method of rendering the worthy Envoy odious to the majo∣rity, <HI>in numbers,</HI> of his State, and of preparing the way for his being rejected at another election.</P>
<P>But, though this might be the principle object with the "<HI>honourable</HI> mover," as he has been iro∣nically called, yet we must not suppose all the mem∣bers of opposition to have no higher views. They undoubtedly participate with Mr. <HI>Livingston</HI> in a detestation of the Envoy. I presume this, because it is natural; but their projects seem to be much more extensive than the ousting of a governor. Their eyes are fixed on another quarter, where a nobler game presents itself. In short, if I have any pene∣tration, their plan is nothing short of driving the President of the United States from the post he now fills.</P>
<P>If there be any one who, measuring the hearts of others by his own, looks upon this as impossible, I request him to turn his eye to the insults that have been heaped on this Saviour of his country during the present session of Congress. The fact is, nobo∣dy doubts of this, and the only thing that surprises
<PB N="119" REF="030221_0051_0FE5296216A9E140"/>
me, is, nobody attempts to render the destructive project abortive.</P>
<P>It may be asked; what views can the opposition have? to this question I answer by another: what views have the disorganizers in every country? what views could the <HI>nobleman</HI> have who proposed, in France, the abolition of <HI>nobility?</HI> what views had the <HI>bishop</HI> who proposed the abolition of <HI>religion?</HI> what views had the silly Lord Stanhope when he proposed an imitation of the French sans-culottes, and declared <HI>he would like to be hanged?</HI> if there were any thing too stupid, absurd and vile, to be wished for by those who are the partizans of France and of French principles, then we might enquire, what men could propose to themselves in driving a Chief Magistrate like ours from his post.</P>
<P>That they may not succeed is surely the sincere desire of every man, who wishes well to this coun∣try. But the event is, at least, doubtful. It re∣quires fortitude something more than human, to en∣dure such treatment as the President has received, without yielding to the dictates of disgust. There is hardly a man on earth but himself, that would not have retired long ago. For my part, I should have hurled the papers in their face, in the midst of their quibbling and spiteful harrangues, sent them my resignation and retired to my home. Hap∣pily, General Washington is a man of another cha∣racter. But it is not reasonable to hope, that he will bear this tantalizing for ever: there is a certain point beyond which the patience and fortitude of no man can go, and should his ungrateful enemies surpass it, we must expect to be left adrift in the storm.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="030221_0052_0FE52907852AC8D0"/>I know, that it is become a custom to speak lightly of the services, past as well as present, of this great man, and that his adversaries ask, with a sort of triumph; what! is America so poor in ta∣lents and virtue as not to possess another man fit for President?—I am far from thinking any such thing. I believe there are many men in America of great talents and virtues, even equal to those of General Washington; but there is something more necessary in the chief of this Union, which no man possesses but himself; and that is, <HI>Universal confi∣dence.</HI> Some other man may be found, the favour∣ite of this or that part of the Union; but no other, of every part of it. It is a melancholy truth, but a truth, it is, that his life, as it grows towards a close, becomes still more and more necessary to his constituents. I do not scruple to say, and I care not who differs from me, that it is he, and <HI>he alone,</HI> that has kept the Union entire to this day. Se∣veral gentlemen have been named as his successors, all of them, without doubt, very fit for the impor∣tant functions they would have to exercise; but, I ask any thinking man, if, with the example they have before their eyes, either of them would accept of the Presidency, or, if they should, if they would be able to maintain harmony among the States for one year? I am confident they would not, unless a change of principles should take place, which, at present, there is little reason to expect.</P>
<P>These considerations ought to unite the friends of order and good government in their attachment to the man of their choice. They should not con∣tent themselves with silent approbation of his con∣duct, or confine the effusions of their gratitude to sentiments over the bottle: the applause of a drunk∣ard is little better than slander. No; this is not the
<PB N="121" REF="030221_0053_0FE529090C0A17A0"/>
way of giving support to the government; it is to be done by manly and affectionate addresses; by public declarations of disapprobation of the conduct of the enemies to the peace and happiness of the country; and by zealous and effectual endeavours to undeceive the misguided multitude.</P>

<P>It is a truth, which cannot be too often repeated, that the opposers of the British treaty are for the most part, men who have long and steadily oppos∣ed every salutary measure of the general govern∣ment, joined by such as this treaty obliged to pay their just debts. It is well known that it is against the Southern States alone that the British mer∣chants complain, and for this reason it is that we see the members from those States most opposed to it. All the names in the above lists, written in <HI>italicks,</HI> are of members coming from States to the North of Virginia, from which it will appear, that only two members from the Southern States voted in the minority. This circumstance is a sufficient proof of the motives of the opposition.</P>

<HEAD>RESOLUTION BY WAY OF PROTEST AGAINST THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 26.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The House having resolved itself into a committee of the whole on the Message from the President, <HI>Mr. Blount,</HI> (from North Carolina) moved the following resolutions, which were finally passed.</P>
<P>Resolved, that, it being declared by the second section of the second article of the constitution, <Q>that the Pre∣sident shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senate present concur,</Q> the House of Representatives do not claim any agency in <HI>making treaties;</HI> but that when a treaty stipulates regulations <HI>on any of the subjects submitted by the constitution to the power of Congress,</HI> it must depend for its execution, as to such stipulations, on a law or laws to be passed by Congress, and it is the con∣stitutional
<PB N="123" REF="030221_0055_0FE529136199A770"/>
right and duty of the House of Representatives; in all such cases, to deliberate on the expediency or inex∣pediency of carrying such treaties into effect, and to de∣termine and act thereon, as in <HI>their judgment</HI> may be most conducive to the public good.</P>
<P>Resolved, that it is not necessary to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any application from this House to the Executive for in∣formation desired by them, and which may relate to any constitutional functions of the House, that the purposes for which such information may be wanted, or to which the same may be applied, should be stated in the application.</P>
<P>On the latter of these resolutions it is only neces∣sary to observe, that it is by no means inconsistent with the motives that dictated the call for papers; those motives I have already stated, it will there∣fore be useless to say anything more on the resolution.</P>
<P>The first resolution merits a great deal of atten∣tion, as it seems, to be the lasting definition of the treaty making power.</P>
<P><HI>Patriot Madison</HI> was the only member that en∣tered into a defence of this resolution. To give his speech here would be to fill up my pages with what no one would read: I shall, therefore, con∣tent myself with inserting an extract from the de∣bates in the Virginia Convention, at the time when the Constitution of the United States was under consideration.</P>
<P>The reader should be informed, that this <HI>patriot</HI> was, at the time of forming the constitution, a firm friend to it; and indeed, I have seen it asserted in print, that he even drew it up. Let us, then, compare the explanation he gave of this treaty mak∣ing clause, at the time the constitution was under
<PB N="124" REF="030221_0056_0FE4FE5EC4DE6620"/>
consideration, with the explanation contained in the resolution which he now supports.</P>
<P>A member in the convention having objected to the treaty making power, as expressed in the con∣stitution, because treaties became supreme laws of the land, <HI>without the participation of Congress,</HI> pa∣triot Madison rose and said: <Q><HI>Are not treaties the law of the land in England?</HI> I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand, Black∣stone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties, <HI>made by the king,</HI> are to be the supreme laws of the land. <HI>If they are to have any effi∣cacy they must be laws of the land.</HI> They are so <HI>in every country.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now where has the patriot been since the time that he gave this explanation of the treaty making power? what sort of company must he have fallen into? I should be very sorry to suppose that he has drank at the fountain that poisoned his countryman Randolph; but, really such a change of sentiment such directly contradictory explanation of the very same clause, is hard to be accounted for.</P>
<P>In this debate on the call for the papers, which was, in fact, a debate on the treaty making power, the patriot was several times called on for an ex∣planation of his doctrine advanced in the conven∣tion. He had the prudence to avoid an answer at that time; and to reserve himself for the discussion of the present resolution. He tells us here, that, upon <HI>his honour,</HI> he has <HI>forgotten</HI> what passed in the convention; but that, however <HI>respectable</HI> such au∣thorities may be, the constitution must now <HI>ex∣plain itself.</HI>—And so, Sir, you have <HI>forgotten,</HI> have you? Forgotten all about it? the waters of Virgi∣nia,
<PB N="125" REF="030221_0057_0FE52914E87B0598"/>
where you have undergone your political bap∣tism, and where you have emerged a new man, are I suppose, like those of Lethe,
<Q><L>"Where mortals the <HI>sweets of forgetfulness</HI> prove;</L>
<L>"Where the <HI>Slave-dealer's</HI> conscience is cas'd of its woes,</L>
<L>"And <HI>the Debtor forgets all the debts that he owes."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But, though Mr. Madison had been dipped in the pool of oblivion, some other members of the House had not, and as they made so pressing a call on him for the explanation, he was obliged to say something. It was not certainly a very satisfactory answer, to say that, however <HI>respectable</HI> such autho∣rities might be, the constitution must now <HI>explain itself.</HI> As to the <HI>respectability</HI> of the authority, as far as relates to himself, I am ready to give that up; but how the constitution is to explain itself, when he has found out five different constructions of the same clause, I cannot perceive. If it be true, that he penned the constitution, I hope he will not boast of his work, unless, indeed, which is not impossi∣ble, he wished it to answer all the convenient pur∣poses of a Jesuit's Creed.</P>
<P>The President, in his message, tells the House, with the candour and uprighthness of heart which so eminently distinguish him from his adversaries, that, the treaty making power has been thus un∣derstood by both parties in the negociations with foreign powers. "It is thus," says he, <Q>that the treaty making power has been understood by foreign nations; and in all treaties made with them, <HI>we</HI> have declared, and they have believed, that when ratified by the President, with the ad∣vice
<PB N="126" REF="030221_0058_0FE529BA0D1142B8"/>
and consent of the Senate, they became ob∣ligatory.</Q>—To this Mr. Madison replies: <Q>By <HI>we</HI> was to be understood the executive alone, and not the House of Representatives.</Q> Again he observes that <Q>this was the first treaty made with a <HI>foreign</HI> power, since the operation of the present government; and that therefore prece∣dents must lose much of their weight.</Q></P>
<P>What the patriot means by a <HI>foreign</HI> power, I know not: it is more than probable that, in his ample budget of constructions, he may have a dozen or two ready to be applied to his word <HI>fo∣reign;</HI> but, according to my simple conception of the meaning of this epithet, it is applicable to every power with whom the United States have made, or can make, treaties; and of course, it ought to be applied to the Indian as well as to the European na∣tions. The continental powers of Europe are all situated on the same land; some of them must necessarily be divided by land-marks, as we are from the Indians, yet they treat each other as <HI>fo∣reign</HI> powers. If the word <HI>foreign</HI> is to be applied to no nation situated on the same land with ourselves, it is yet to be proved, whether it ought to be appli∣ed to France and Spain, or not. Indeed, it is likely, that the patriot means to confine the word <HI>foreign</HI> to the British nation, as the only one which is divided from us by the sea; if so, and if he should be able to persuade us, that his <HI>construction</HI> is a good one, we may then allow, that this treaty is the first which the Federal Government has form∣ed with foreign powers; but, till he can do this, I for my part, must continue to look upon the trea∣ties made with the Indians, as made with foreign powers.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="030221_0059_0FE5297308865F80"/>If then it be true, and true it most assuredly is, that the treaties made with the Indians, bear in themselves the full force of the principle laid down by the President: <Q>that when ratified by the Pre∣sident and Senate, they become obligatory,</Q> how happens it, that no objection was ever yet made to their contents in that respect? foreign na∣tions have seen those treaties go quietly into effect, without waiting for the sanction of the House of Representatives; and this, of itself, was a decla∣ration of the whole nation, that no such sanction was necessary. But, says the patriot, "the House of Representatives never made any such declara∣tion;" and for this very reason; because no such declaration was wanted. The President and Senate ratified the treaties, and nobody disputed their au∣thority so to do; the unmaking power of the House was reserved to be exercised on the present oc∣casion.</P>
<P>Had the House of Representatives possessed the power of setting a treaty aside, or rather as they now contend, of giving it a final ratification, they should have come forward and declared so, when the first treaty made under the present government was laid before them. This would have been can∣didly telling other powers not to look upon a treaty as finally ratified by the United States, till it had been approved of by the House; and, in the present instance, the king of great Britain would not have been deceived into a ratification on his part, till such approbation had been obtained.</P>
<P>Taking leave of the tergiversation of patriot Madison, I shall add a few short remarks on the reso∣lution itself.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="030221_0060_0FE52934A9557B60"/>One of its greatest faults is, its unnecessary length; it is however, like all the other propositions brought forward by the Opposition: calculated to deceive the multitude, and rally them under the banners of an interested and, perhaps, corrupted faction, under the pretext of supporting their rights. The plain meaning of it is this: <HI>The President and Senate have a right to</HI> make <HI>treaties, and the House of Representatives to</HI> unmake <HI>them;</HI> and Mr. Blount, if he had had as much courage as malice, would have couched it in these very words.</P>
<P><Q>When a treaty, says the resolution, stipu∣lates regulations on any subjects submitted by the Constitution to the power of Congress, it must depend for its execution on Congress,</Q> and con∣seqently, on the House of Representatives. Seve∣ral regulations are submitted to the power of Con∣gress: I shall confine myself to one only, as suffi∣cient to demonstrate the consequences of the doc∣trine here held up. "Congress," says the Consti∣tution <Q><HI>is empowered</HI> to regulate commerce with fo∣reign nations.</Q> Now what treaty, let me ask, can the United States make with any nation on earth, <HI>not containing stipulations on commerce?</HI> what treaty can be formed with Great Britain, with Spain, with the Algerines, or even with the Indians, that does not contain stipulations of this kind? There are treaties with them all now before the House, and they all do contain such stipulations. It fol∣lows, of course, that the President and Senate can make no treaty, that can be carried into execution without the consent, or ratification of the House of Representatives.</P>
<P>Yes, there are treaties of alliance offensive or defensive, or both, which may not contain stipula∣lations
<PB N="129" REF="030221_0061_0FE529651FE1B670" MS="y"/>
on commerce; but then, the Congress has the power to declare war, and as these are certainly warlike regulations, the House of Representatives will undoubtedly claim a participation in making them, or at least in unmaking them, according to the spirit of the resolution. So that, the President and Senate's treaty making power is, in fact, no power at all. It is a mere form of words; a de∣ception thrown out to give foreign nations a be∣lief of the stability and promptitude of this govern∣ment; in order to lure them into <HI>concessions,</HI> while the <HI>real</HI> power is reserved for annulling such treaties, as fall short of the exorbitant pretensions, or mili∣tate against the interested views, of these States.</P>
<P>If a vote of the House of Representatives be necessary to the <HI>ratification</HI> of a treaty; I say rati∣fication because that ACT alone is worthy of the name, which gives full and complete effect to a treaty; if then, a vote of this House be necessary to such ratification, it should be obtained <HI>before</HI> the ratification be dispatched to a foreign court. Any other manner of proceeding is mere duplicity. What says the treaty before us: <Q>This treaty, when the same shall have been ratified by His Ma∣jesty, and by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Senate, and the respective ratifications mutually ex∣changed, shall be binding and obligatory on His Majesty and on the said States, &amp;c.</Q> Now, this has been done; the treaty has been ratified by His Majesty and by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and yet the House of Representatives pretend, that it is <HI>not</HI> binding on these States, with∣out <HI>their consent</HI> also. Is this duplicity, or is it something worse!</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030221_0062_0FE529166C444680"/>Suppose the posts, which are, in fulfilment of this treaty, to be delivered up to the United States, were situated in some part of Europe, where no intelligence of this resolution could be obtained in due time to prevent the delivery; or suppose the treaty had stipulated for the western posts being gi∣ven up in the month of December last. Had either of these been the case, Great Britain would have fulfilled her engagement, in this respect, while the United States are debating with themselves <HI>whether they shall fulfil theirs or not.</HI> What sort of national faith is this? to make use of the words of Mr. Giles respecting the land jobbers, this is <HI>swindling upon a broad scale,</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>This resolution, whatever may be the fate of the British treaty, will have the most pernicious effects on the relations of the United States with foreign nations. If the ministers of any power can be supposed to understand this Constitution, it must be those of Great Britain. We see, that they have understood it as giving the sole power of making and ratifying treaties to the President and Senate; and it is certain that other powers have, till now understood it in the same way. But, the resoluti∣on of <HI>patriot</HI> Blount is well calculated to undeceive them. All nations will now say: <Q>Yes, the Ame∣ricans have a President and Senate, whom they hold forth to us as officers empowered to make treaties with us, and to give such treaties their full effect, as "supreme laws of their land;" but we now perceive that this is all deception; these officers are only authorized to make and ratify <HI>sham</HI> treaties with us; if they obtain their wishes, they confirm these treaties afterwards, but if not, they re∣serve to themselves the power of setting them aside.</Q> In future, therefore, we must naturally expect, that
<PB N="131" REF="030221_0063_0FE52937A03AC350"/>
no power on earth, except, perhaps, a humiliated king of Spain, or a stupid Indian Chief, will ever look upon a treaty with us as legally ratified, till it has received the sanction of the House of Repre∣sentatives; nay, were I a prince, I would not ratify, till the treaty had been signed by every individual mem∣ber of the sovereign people; for, as <HI>patriot</HI> Madison judiciously observed, <Q>there is a <HI>provident</HI> article in the Constitution itself, by which an avenue is always left open to the <HI>sovereign people</HI> for <HI>expla∣nations or amendments,</HI> as they may be found indispensable.</Q></P>
<P>Here I shall be told, that the British House of Commons possesses the same power, with respect to treaties as is contended for by the House of Repre∣sentatives, and yet, that does not prevent other nations from treating with the king of Great Bri∣tain. If any inconsistency on the part of the Op∣position could at this day excite surprize, it would be their having held up the practices of Great Britain as proper for their imitation. What! these very men, whose continual theme has been the execrating of the practices of that nation, now fly to it for precidents! the first writer that appear∣ed in opposition to the British treaty, represented it as dangerous, because it would <Q>tend to the in∣troduction of the fashions, forms and <HI>precedents</HI> of a monarchy!</Q> <HI>Mr. Giles</HI> said, in the de∣bate concerning Randall, that <Q>he should be <HI>sorry</HI> to see <HI>this House</HI> adopt <HI>precedents</HI> from the British House of Commons!</Q> several times during this very debate, it was averred that the Constitution of Great Britain was just crumbling to pieces; and it is no long∣er ago than last year, that the sagacious <HI>patriot</HI> Madi∣son foretold, that he should soon see the peers of Great Britain coming to ask a lodging from him. Mr. Swanwick, in the debates on the frigates, said that
<PB N="132" REF="030221_0064_0FE5298FC0FAA028"/>
Great Britain was on the verge of ruin. Another of these opposers declared she was at her last gasp. And these are the men, who now tell us, that imi∣tating Great Britain is the only way of preserving the liberties of the people; while they seize every opportunity most slanderously to represent the peo∣ple of that country as slaves.</P>
<P>But, what are these precedents which they have taken from the Constitution of Great Britain? they tell us that the House of Commons claim a right to withhold the supplies necessary to carry a treaty into effect. They claim this right with re∣spect to all supplies; but, were they ever known to exercise it since the reign of the profligate french∣ified Charles? at least, were they ever known to exercise it for the purpose of violating a treaty made with a foreign power? I defy these gentlemen to prove any such thing, and even if they could prove it, I would be very glad to know, how the precedent will apply to themselves. The British Constitution, happily for the people of that coun∣try, is not written in a book; is not reduced to a few clauses, each of which admits of <HI>five con∣structions.</HI> There is no positive law that says to the House of Commons; <Q>you shall have no de∣liberative voice on the expediency or inexpedien∣cy of treaties.</Q> This is not necessary in a go∣vernment like that of Great Britain. The organ∣ization of the House of Commons is itself a gua∣rantee for their doing nothing that may endanger the honour or safety of the State. The electors there are few; the members are the representatives of property, and not of numbers. They are elect∣ed for seven years, and not for two. They are independent of the mob, a much better security for the state, than their being independent of those
<PB N="133" REF="030221_0065_0FE5296FFA3B7498"/>
who sit at the helm of affairs. There is not, I am persuaded, a man in that House, who could, under any circumstances, bring himself to avow openly, that "he <HI>adored</HI> the voice of the people," as Mr. Giles did in the debate on the call for pa∣pers. There is not the most distant resemblance between the House of Commons and the House of Representatives; and therefore the citing of prece∣dents from the records of each other must be to∣tally inadmissible. In one particular, however, I am willing to allow that the House of Represen∣tatives would do well in imitating the House of Commons, and here, I believe I shall be seconded by every honest man in the Union; I mean in making provision for carrying the present treaty into effect.</P>
<P>In the Philadelphia Gazette of last year I find the following words, made use of by <HI>Mr. Giles</HI> in the debate on the allowances to members of Congress. <Q>Mr. Giles said, there was a country from which America had <HI>copied</HI> a great deal <HI>too much.</HI> The members of the British House of Commons re∣ceived no wages, while the officers of state had immense salaries. It was, however, <HI>understood</HI> that the British House of Commons were very <HI>well paid.</HI> Mr. Giles did not wish to see <HI>scenes</HI> of that kind <HI>in this country.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to ask this talkative gentleman, what he meant by "scenes"? If this were permitted, I would go on, and ask him, what he meant by <HI>copying too much</HI> from Great Britain? if he himself be a copy of some original from that country, which I believe to be the case, in this instance I shall not contend, that we have not copied too much; but as to wa∣ges
<PB N="134" REF="030221_0066_0FE52917F0F95A80"/>
to members of Congress, I think we have not copied quite enough, witness a session spun out to the month of May, and nothing done. Again, I would ask him, how he came to <HI>understand</HI> that the members of the British House of Commons were very <HI>well paid,</HI> or in other words, <HI>corrupted by the King?</HI> he knows how severely I could retort upon him here; how I could dare him to a com∣parison; but I forbear, and return to the sentence of this extract which so immediately applies to the subject before us.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the members of the House of Commons receive no stipend for their services in that capacity, therefore, when the proposal be∣fore the House was to draw money out of the pockets of the people to pay Mr. Giles and his colleagues such a stipend, he thought America should not copy from Great Britain. Imitating the House of Commons in this instance, would have deprived the gentleman of what he probably <HI>"adored"</HI> as much as he does "the voice of the people," and, perhaps, a great deal more. The House of Commons was therefore thrown aside, as totally unworthy of imitation; but, when some∣thing from the records of that House seemed to strengthen the arguments of Mr. Giles for setting aside the treaty, then it was not wrong to copy from it: it was to be imitated as the only model; as the only assembly in the world, that was the true repository of the liberties of the people.— These palpable inconsistencies I leave Mr. Giles to reconcile, which I make no doubt he will be able to do, to the entire satisfaction of <HI>his</HI> constituents.</P>
<P>I shall now dismiss this resolution of citizen Blount, with observing, that if no treaty, <HI>contain∣ing
<PB N="135" REF="030221_0067_0FE5299144D050A8"/>
stipulations on commerce,</HI> is finally ratified till sanctioned by a vote of the House of Representa∣tives, no treaty, formed by the present government is yet valid; for though that with Spain for in∣stance has been sanctioned by the House, such sanction was not obtained prior to the ratification by the king of Spain. The ratification which that king now possesses is not valid, and therefore the treaty is not. This is clear and fair reasoning, and I defy even patriot Madison, with his five con∣structions, to oppose it with success. Is it asserted that the ratification now in the hands of the court of Spain is binding on the United States? so then, is the ratification now in the hands of His Britan∣nic Majesty; for they have both emanated from exactly the same powers. If the ratification ex∣changed with Great Britain be not final, be not ob∣ligatory, neither is that exchanged with Spain; the kings of both nations have been duped; they have exchanged obligatory ratifications for such as were not obligatory, and of course, both the trea∣ties become null and void: nor should I scruple, were I the minister of either of those princes, to advise an infraction of either treaty, when circum∣stances might render it convenient; fully confident that this resolution of the House of Representatives would justify the proceeding.</P>

<HEAD>RESOLUTION FOR SETTING ASIDE THE BRIT∣ISH TREATY.
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 14th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. HILLHOUSE (from Connecticut) having brought forward a resolution for passing the laws necessary to car∣ry
<PB N="136" REF="030221_0068_0FE529BB8EBE79A0"/>
the treaty into effect, <HI>Mr. Maclay</HI> spoke against it, and concluded his speech with the following preamble and resolution.</P>
<P><Q>The House having taken into consideration the trea∣ty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and Great Britain, communicated by the President in his message of the first day of March last, are of opinion, that it is in many respects highly injurious to the interests of the United States; yet, <HI>were they possessed of any information which could justify the great sacrifices,</HI> contained in the treaty, their sincere desire to cherish harmony and amicable intercourse with all nations, and their earnest wish to co-operate in has∣tening a final adjustment of the differences subsisting between the United States and Great Britain, might have induced them to wave their objections to the trea∣ty; but, <HI>when they contemplate the conduct of Great-Bri∣tain in persevering since the treaty was signed, in the im∣pressment of American Seamen and the seizure of American vessels (laden with provisions) contrary to the sacred rights of neutral nations;</HI> whether this be viewed as the con∣struction meant to be given to any articles in the trea∣ty, or as contrary to an infraction of the true meaning and spirit thereof, the house cannot but regard it as incumbent on them, in fidelity to the trust reposed in them, to forbear, under such circumstances, taking at present any active measures on the subject, therefore, <HI>Resolved, that under the circumstances aforesaid, and with such information as the House possess, it is not expedient at this time to concur in passing the laws necessary for carrying the said treaty into effect.</HI></Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="commentary">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The preamble to this resolution holds out as an excuse for withholding the supplies, that, <HI>the House is not in possession of any information to justify the great sacrifices, contained in the treaty.</HI> What informati∣on could possibly render those sacrifices less than they are? how could the communication of the correspondence between the President and Mr. Jay
<PB N="137" REF="030221_0069_0FE529748C2F9548"/>
alter the nature of sacrifices contained in the trea∣ty itself? If an infraction of this treaty should take place on the part of Great Britain, to what should we appeal? to the treaty itself, and not to the notes and conversations employed in the negociation. The instrument itself is good or bad, and contains in it∣self full proofs of either, and, if the House have a right to decide on its merits, why not do it bold∣ly; why not scorn this miserable subterfuge?</P>
<P>"But," says the preamble, <Q>when they con∣template the conduct of Great Britain since the treaty was signed, &amp;c.</Q> Now, allowing all the falshoods which have been circulated concerning impressments and seizures, to be undeniable truths, and that they are all contrary to the rights of neu∣tral nations, what have they to do with laws neces∣sary to carry the treaty into effect? or how can the papers of negociation render them more or less in∣jurious? if they are contrary to the rights of neu∣tral nations, or to the letter of the treaty, no pa∣pers whatever can justify them; if they are not, no papers can render them unjustifiable.</P>
<P>One sentence in this preample is singularly unfor∣tunate: <HI>"since</HI> the treaty was <HI>signed."</HI> Observe here well, that an objection to giving the treaty its final ratification is founded on something that Great Britain has done as an <HI>infraction of it.</HI> The gentle∣men have fairly tumbled into their own pit. Ac∣cording to the resolution of Mr. Blount, now on the journals of the House, the treaty is not a law of this land; it is not in force; it is not yet a treaty; and consequently the British can be guilty of no infraction. Do the Opposition wish, that this instrument should be obligatory on Great Bri∣tain, from the moment of the signing of the ratifi∣cations
<PB N="138" REF="030221_0070_0FE529BE4DDB3208"/>
as they now stand, and that it should not even yet be obligatory on these States? they may, probably, find powers to treat with them on this footing; a king of scalpes, the five kings of France (barber Tom and his comrades four) or a degene∣rate scion of the stump of the Bourbons, may, per∣haps, do it; but the king of Great Britain never will.</P>
<P>After these remarks on this hypoctritical and ab∣surd preamble, I shall endeavour to point out the fatal consequences that the adoption of the resolution must be attended with, taking, previously, a view of the causes which have led to the present opposi∣tion. If, in doing this, I make use of an undis∣guised language, which, notwithstanding the boast∣ed liberty of the press, is little customary in these States, I hope, my liege Lords, the sovereign-citi∣zens, will not take offence, as I declare upon my honour, that my motive, and my only motive, is, to persuade them to live in peace with the only power on earth that is capable of doing them an injury in war.</P>
<P>Among the causes of the opposition to the treaty, the stipulation for an honourable discharge of the debts, due from the Southern States (<HI>Virginia</HI> in particular) to the merchants of Great Britain, cer∣tainly claims the first place. These debts, due be∣fore the American war, were, according to the treaty of peace, to be honourably discharged; or, at least, no law was to be passed, or to remain in force, which might operate as an impediment to their recovery. Here is the article of the treaty: <Q><HI>Art.</HI> IV. It is agreed, that creditors on ei∣ther side, <HI>shall meet with no lawful impediment</HI> to
<PB N="139" REF="030221_0071_0FE528B4B0F83D58"/>
the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all <HI>bona fide</HI> debts heretofore contracted.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, in defiance of the general government, and regardless of the national faith, thus solemnly pledged, the State of Virginia in particular has enacted, or kept in force, such laws as are an impediment to the recovery of these debts. In consequence of this violation of the treaty of peace, and as a protection due from Great Britain to her merchants, she kept possession of the Wes∣tern Posts, in order to oblige the United States to a fulfilment of their engagements. The <HI>debtor</HI> State, or States, have continued their dishonoura∣ble laws in force to this day, and for this reason it is, that to this day Great Britain keeps the forts in her possession.</P>
<P>When a new treaty between the two nations was to be made, the relinguishment of the posts was the first object on the part of Great Britain, and accordingly, the treaty sets out with a stipula∣tion for their being given up, <HI>on the first day of June</HI> 1796, five weeks from this day. But, on the other hand, the United States stipulate to pay, or cause to be paid, the abovementioned debts, the recovery of which has been hitherto unjustly imped∣ed, by acts which the Virginians have the assur∣ance to dignify with the names of laws.</P>
<P>It was not to be supposed that Virginia would not oppose to this arrangement. Both her Senators stepped forward against the treaty. One of them, Mr. Mason divulged its contents prematurely. It was printed without the permission of the Executive power; agents were dispatched with it to every part of the Union, with instructions to misrepresent its meaning, and to stir up such an opposition as might
<PB N="140" REF="030221_0072_0FE5299A6E3EA750"/>
deter the President from a ratification. The fol∣lowing advertisement will fully show the temper of that State at the time.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>I must beg to be excused for stepping aside from my subject a minute, in order to make a few observations, of a more general nature, on the conduct of this turbulent, and I may say rebellious State. One of her Representatives in Congress, Mr. Giles said, <Q>that he hoped Virginia would pursue uniformly the line of conduct that had ever marked her political character. Her con∣duct, he observed, had been uniform from the beginning of the revolution to the present day; uniform and exemplary in her <HI>obedience to the laws,</HI> &amp;c.—He prided himself in represening such a State.</Q> About a <HI>twentieth part</HI> of such
<PB N="141" REF="030221_0073_0FE5297EE09E24B8"/>
a State, the gentleman meant, without doubt; that is, if he did not, for the moment, mean to give up his title of "<HI>immediate</HI> representative."</P>
<P>Indeed, as Mr. Giles observed, the conduct of his State has been uniform, if a continual disaffec∣tion to the government of the United States, some∣times concealed under the mask of hypocrisy and base crawling flattery, and sometimes breaking out in open opposition; if this be a uniform conduct, her conduct has been uniform. The reader must have remarked the word <HI>"British Tyrant."</HI> in the above advertisement, and he must also know that to abuse and vilify that monarch is the favourite theme of Virginians. Now, to give him a pretty correct idea of the uniformity of their political conduct, I shall here insert an extract from the American Magazine for September, 1769. <Q>We your Majesty's <HI>most loyal, dutiful,</HI> and <HI>affectionate sub∣jects,</HI> of your Majesty's ancient colony of Virgi∣nia, beg leave in the <HI>humblest manner,</HI> to assure your Majesty, that your faithful Subjects of this colony, ever distinguished by their loyalty and firm attachment to your Majesty and your royal ancestors, &amp;c. &amp;c. We are <HI>ready to sacrifice our lives and fortunes</HI> in defence of your Majesty's <HI>sacred</HI> person and government.—It is with the deepest concern and most <HI>heart felt grief</HI> that your Majesty's dutiful subjects of this colony find that their loyalty hath been <HI>traduced</HI> and that those measures which a just regard for the <HI>British Constitution (dearer to them than life)</HI> made necessary duties, have been misrepresented as rebellious attacks on your Majesty's govern∣ment.—After expressing our confidence in your royal <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>goodness,</HI> permit us to assure your Majesty, that the most fervent prayers of your
<PB N="142" REF="030221_0074_0FE5298082FCEC50"/>
people of this colony are <HI>daily addressed to the Almighty,</HI> that your Majesty's reign may be long and prosperous over Great Britain and all your Dominions; and that after death, your Majesty may taste the fullest fruition of eternal bliss, and that a descendant of your illustrious House may reign over the extended British Empire <HI>until time shall be no more.</HI></Q> AMEN!</P>
<P>The man whose <HI>sacred</HI> person they were ready to sacrifice life and fortune in defence of, is now called the <HI>"British Tyrant;"</HI> and <HI>"the British Con∣stitutution, dearer to them than life;"</HI> is now, <HI>"the gall∣ing yoke of Great Britain!"</HI> Poor bankrupt devils, the king of great Britain stands in no need of their lives and fortunes nor of their prayers daily addres∣sed to the Almighty. Neither do their curses affect him a bit more than those of the French atheists. I dare say, if the truth were known, that he does not think half so much about the "ancient and dutiful and loyal and pious State of Virginia" as he does about the kennel of his Stag-Hounds.</P>
<P>Another trait of the uniformity of conduct in this State is exhibited in her behaviour to the Presi∣dent of the United States. After his election, he received the first address from the Virginians. I can say nothing better nor worse of this address, than that it was full as dutiful, affectionate and <HI>sincere,</HI> as the address to the king. Let any man compare that address with the insults that this in∣solent State, and her members in Congress, have heaped on the President during the last nine months, and then doubt of the uniformity of the conduct of Virginia, if he can.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="030221_0075_0FE529820689CC30"/>But Mr. Giles says, <Q>Virginia has been uniform and exemplary in her <HI>obedience to the laws.</HI></Q> I shall mention but two instances of this. The first is, her having absolutely disobeyed the treaty of peace, by making, or keeping in force, acts which have hitherto prevented the fulfilment of that treaty, and which had nearly plunged the Union into a war. The second instance is, her having attempted, during this very session of Congress, to raise up an opposition to the government in every State in the Union, and even to destroy the Constitution. If these instances of her <HI>"obedience to the laws"</HI> were not sufficient, one might add her instructions, to all her representatives, to oppose the execution of the British Treaty, "a supreme law of the land." Such are the proofs which Mr. Giles might have cited of her <Q>uniform and <HI>exemplary</HI> obedience to the laws.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Giles may "pride himself in being a repre∣sentative from "such a State;" but, I believe that few men, who do not <HI>adore</HI> <Q>the voice of the people,</Q> will envy him his post.</P>
<P>Who did not expect that every member from this State would do his utmost to set the treaty aside? the final determination of the House of Representatives is not yet known; but I do not scruple to declare all those enemies of the treaty, who voted in favour of Mr. Blount's resolution, and it is well known that every member from Vir∣ginia is included in that number. Had the treaty been opposed from any other motive than the one I contend for, surely, out of eighteen members, some one would have been found not included in the opposition.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="030221_0076_0FE528D6819D5480"/>If there are any particular members, among those now leagued against the constitution, who claim the guilty pre-eminence, it must be those who are ac∣tuated by this selfish, this disgraceful motive. It is a truth, and a truth that will be a lasting stigma on the American character, that, if this treaty be rendered null, it will be for no other reason, than <HI>because it engages for a discharge of just debts,</HI> on the part of Americans.</P>
<P>I am far from wishing to insinuate, that there are no honourable exceptions to be found among the people of Virginia: a recent attempt in their legislature to subject lands to seizure for the pay∣ment of debts is a full proof that such exceptions do exist; but in speaking of a State we must speak of it as one; our opinions must be founded on the measures, it adopts, whether such measures may be the effect of the unanimous voice of the people or not. In like manner foreign nations must judge of the United States. If they fail in the fulfilment of their engagements; if the swindling propositions for an∣nulling the treaty should finally succeed; foreign nations will pronounce on the measure itself, with∣out paying any attention to our internal disputes and divisions. The minority will be lumped with the majority; the everlasting stain will imprint itself on the whole American people, not excepting the hitherto spotless character of a Washington.</P>
<P>French influence is another source of opposition to the treaty. Those who have read Mr. Ran∣dolph's Vindication, as it was humourously called, have seen how narrowly the President escaped from the plots of that gentleman; what overtures were made to the French Minister for <Q>some thousands of dollars." They will see how that "pretend∣ed
<PB N="145" REF="030221_0077_0FE5299D4D0AF570"/>
patriot</Q> laboured to protract the ratification; how well his plans were laid for embroiling this country with Great Britain, and how all his mea∣sures were taken for subjecting the government of this country to France. I do not say, that any of the members, who now oppose the government and the treaty, are absolutely in the pay of the five kings; but, after reviewing the mutinous conduct of the Secretary of State; after having duly considered the rank of the person on whose behalf, as well as his own, certain overtures were made; after having seen some of the men now in Congress, parti∣cularly <HI>an inconsistent leader,</HI> named as a confiden∣tial friend of <HI>Citizen Fauchet,</HI> I must be excused, if I have my doubts. Doubts I shall have till I see those, who now oppose the treaty, cease their eulogiums, their fulsome and nauseous eulo∣giums, of a people, who, in their present state, are not entitled even to pity.</P>
<P>What influence the French have had among the multitude will appear from two circumstances (I could mention a thousand) fresh in every ones mind. At the town-meeting at New York, called to con∣demn the treaty, the people marched under the banners of France and America. These flags were carried at the head of the vile and insolent proces∣sion that proceeded to the governor's house, and there burnt the treaty. The other fact is of still more recent date, and still more striking. The petition, said to be signed by fifteen hundred <HI>citi∣zens</HI> of Philadelphia, against the treaty, and now before the House, was carried round for signature by a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> The <HI>chairman</HI> of the meeting was also a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> nor am I sure that it was not originally drawn up in the <HI>French language.</HI> I wonder what the people of England, or, indeed, of
<PB N="146" REF="030221_0078_0FE52971855C4C98"/>
any independant nation, would say to a foreigner, who should carry round for their signature, a petition against the execution of a "law of the land;" a solemn contract entered into between them and another nation? There is a certain point of debase∣ment, below which no nation can sink, whether this be that point, or not, I will not at present take upon me to say; God only knows what he has yet in reserve for us.</P>
<P>I am aware, it will be said here; that, though the chairman, under whose authority and direction this petition was drawn up, was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> yet it was presented to the House by an <HI>Englishman,</HI> or, to speak more correctly, an <HI>Homuncio,</HI> born in En∣gland. But, let it be recollected that this <HI>Homuncio</HI> has, since the beginning of the present war, been a most desperate supporter of the cause of the French; that he trades to France, and to France principally, and that the whole of his political career justifies the name of <HI>English Jacobin.</HI></P>
<P>The reader, from what has been said of this di∣minutive mortal, will at once perceive that I am speaking of <HI>Mr. Swanwick,</HI> one of the august re∣presentatives of the City of Philadelphia. I have been told, that this gentleman has taken upon him to pronounce me a hired <HI>English scribbler.</HI> I will not tell this <HI>omicciuolo</HI> (for the <HI>Italian</HI> diminutive suits him best on every account) what I am; but I will tell him what I am not.—I am not descended from the dregs of the King of Great Britain's Custom-House; I was never fed from the scraps of His Majesties bounty, collected by an honest spy, called <HI>a Tide-Waiter.</HI> I never snapped at the hand that gave me bread, and nourished the streams from which I drew my life. I am the base and
<PB N="147" REF="030221_0079_0FE528D8066EAEC8"/>
cringing flatterer of no man, much less of the men I despise. I never wrote to England an enumera∣tion of my <HI>titles,</HI> outnumbering those of a Spanish Hidalgo, and concluding with, <Q>President of the Emigration society, Treasurer of the Dancing-Assembly, and Trustee of the Young Ladies School.</Q> At the age of <HI>thirty eight,</HI> in the prime of life, I never decorated my bed-chamber with lascivious pictures, <HI>Leda and her Swan,</HI> and such like stimuluses. One who is obliged to have recourse to these miserable shifts is unworthy even of the name <HI>omicciuollo.</HI></P>
<P>After having thus candidly given an account of myself, let me ask you, <HI>Mr. Swanwick,</HI> a question or two.—How came you to imagine yourself blessed with the <HI>aura divina?</HI> how came you to imagine, that the <HI>Muses,</HI> who are of the female sex, had ever cast a favourable eye on you? besides, if you must commit your miserable doggerel to paper, why send it to England for impression? why take such incredible pains to insure its appearance in an English Magazine? why did you not send it to your new country, France? can it be possible that you yet wish to shine among the countrymen of your ancestors? I will wear the shine off you, as sure as you and I live.—As to the piece I here al∣lude to, I have not room, at present, to lay it be∣fore my readers; but I will just ask, how you came to discover, that <HI>Earth</HI> is to <HI>become</HI> the <HI>proto-type of Heaven?</HI></P>
<Q><L>"So shall the year to harmony be given,</L>
<L>"And <HI>earth be found the proto-type of Heav'n."</HI></L></Q>
<P>Let the year be <HI>given to harmony</HI> as much as you please, set all your vestals to chanting, and rock us
<PB N="148" REF="030221_0080_0FE529838CAC1C30"/>
to sleep with your own <HI>canzones,</HI> yet I presume it will never be found that earth is the <HI>proto-type</HI> of heaven; the <HI>proto-type</HI> of something that existed <HI>be∣fore it,</HI> and which it is to <HI>resemble.</HI>—As soon as there is a vacancy in your Young Ladies' Acade∣my, I advise you to fill it yourself, and to let poe∣try and politics alone.</P>
<P>It is just matter of surprize that this gentleman should be elected the representative of such a city as Philadelphia. The arts by which his election was brought about I reserve as the subject of an article in a future Censor. I have heard of a sturdy young Lord in England, who got himself elected through the interest of the wives and daughters of his con∣stituents; Mr. Swanwick will never be suspected of <HI>this kind</HI> of <HI>corruption;</HI> but whether he ought to be suspected of no other kind, is more than I will pre∣tend to determine. Grog is cheap, and its influ∣ence is mighty.</P>
<P>After this long and rambling digression, I return to the subject of French influence, and I am per∣suaded that the reader must agree with me, that, after the Virginia Debts, it has been the principal cause of opposition to the British treaty.</P>
<P>However, it must be confessed, that these causes, powerful as they have been, would have produced but a partial effect, had they not been aided by the delusion of the great body of the people with re∣spect to the situation of Great Britain. The ran∣cour they entertained against that nation laid them open to the falshoods which the friends of France, among whom we may reckon nearly all the News-Printers, so industriously spread through the coun∣try. A hundred times Great Britain has been re∣presented
<PB N="149" REF="030221_0081_0FE5299ECFC07C68"/>
as on the brink of ruin. The editor of the Philadelphia Gazette opened the new-year, 1795, with congratulating his customers on the stability and vigour of the Federal Government, while that of Great Britain was just crumbling to pieces. In the same paper, he called the Island of Britain <HI>"an insular Bastile."</HI>—When intelligence was received of the progress the French were mak∣ing in Holland, the papers announced it as an event that must necessarily be the immediate cause of the total overthrow of the British nation. <Q>The taking of Amsterdam," said the papers, "is the last blow to the power of Britain.</Q> Bets were laid that Great Britain would become an appendage of the French Republic; and more than once were we informed by the public papers, that the tricolor∣ed flag was flying on St. James's Palace.</P>
<P>Gross as these impositions were, they were gree∣dily swallowed by the people, nine tenths of whom believed every assertion of the kind that was made. Men are apt to believe what they wish; it is hard to convince them, that those whom they hate are objects of envy and respect. Such was the gene∣ral opinion of the distresses and weakness of Great Britain, and such the persuasion that her situation would oblige her to yield to any thing that Mr. Jay should dictate, that, when intelligence was re∣ceived of the conclusion of the treaty, <HI>Pichegru</HI> was toasted as the <HI>negociator.</HI></P>
<P>A circumstance like this, though despicable in itself, proves that an opinion was entertained, that His Britannic Majesty had been <HI>forced,</HI> by the suc∣cesses of the French, to accept of such terms as Mr. Jay chose to offer, and, of course, a treaty was expected, at once humiliating to Great Britain
<PB N="150" REF="030221_0082_0FE5294132968BD8"/>
and honourable as well as advantageous to the United States. Nothing equal to these lofty ex∣pectations was to be found in the treaty. It was a disappointment; and disappointment ever disposes men to discontent. In vain were the people told, that they had been deceived with respect to the state of Great Britain: in vain was it hinted to them, that she would finally be successful in the war: their hatred and the continued chain of fals∣hood running through the public papers, had ren∣dered them deaf to the voice of reason and of truth. The Southern Debtors and French Emissaries took advantage of this prevalent delusion, and the op∣position became almost universal.</P>
<P>There were not wanting men of talents to add fuel to the flame, nor were there wanting others, actuated by a sincere love of their country, who endeavoured to counter-act such baleful efforts. It is certainly owing to the writings of these gentle∣men, that the people have latterly begun to form a right judgment of this important treaty, and to rally round that government on which their very existence as an independant nation depends. The judges, too, in the middle and nothern States, have exerted a laudable zeal; some of the public papers have stood forth in the cause of order and truth; and there is not the least doubt, that the treaty would have met with no opposition in the House of Representatives, had not the members been chosen, while the public mind was at the height of its fermentation. This was unfortunate∣ly the case: <HI>treaty,</HI> and <HI>no treaty,</HI> were the signals at the elections; and as the opposers were the most numerous, so are the members of the opposition.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="030221_0083_0FE528E24563BED8"/>Thus is this opposition bottomed on <HI>dishonesty, corruption,</HI> or <HI>ignorance,</HI> and, probably, on all three together. That it may be frustrated is my sincere wish, and that it will I have not the least doubt: I cannot bring myself to imagine, that the people of this country will tamely suffer themselves to be hurled from the pinnacle of national prospe∣rity into the horrid abyss of foreign and civil war, of anarchy, requisitions and massacre, by a band of interested and desperate leaders, who have nothing to lose but the posts which their too credulous constituents have bestowed on them. I have not the least doubt that the nefarious conspiration will be finally rendered abortive, and that the French gold, now in circulation, will be as ineffectual as that formerly distributed among the <Q>pretended patriots of America;</Q> but, while there is a pos∣sibility of the contrary, the attention of the people ought to be directed to the dangers that await them. I shall point out these dangers as they present them∣selves to me: if the reader should think them ima∣ginary, he may do well to treat them like other efforts of imagination; but, if he has the least rea∣son to think them real, it is certainly his duty to en∣deavour to avert them by every exertion in his power.</P>
<P>The first thing that presents itself among the con∣sequences of annulling the treaty, is, the detention of the Western Posts by the British. The not possessing of these posts has latterly cost the people of this country about a million of dollars annually, besides the loss of lives; besides defeats and conti∣nual discontents. The possession of them must, then, be a desirable object. But, say the enemies of the treaty, they ought to have been given up
<PB N="152" REF="030221_0084_0FE52942D0218FF8"/>
long ago, unconditionally. I have proved the con∣trary, and I could repeat my proofs, but this is now totally out of the question: we know they were not given up, that they are not yet given up, and we may be assured that they will not be given up, un∣less the present treaty is carried into effect.</P>
<P>But, it is said, that the British are bound by the treaty to give up the posts on the 1st of June, and that they ought to fulfill this part of their en∣gagements, without paying any attention to what is doing in Congress; that they have no business with our internal disputes, the treaty being the only rule for their conduct; and, with this doctrine in hand, it is supposed, that some members of the House of Representatives mean to delay their decision on the subject till after the first of June; and if the posts are not evacuated at that time, to accuse the Brit∣ish of annulling the treaty. To this I answer: that I am fully persuaded, that the Governor of Cana∣da will retain the posts, till the treaty has been sanc∣tioned by an appropriation law; and that I am ful∣ly convinced he would be justified in so doing. This nation formed a certain constitution, or manner of government, which they promulgated to the world; in this constitution it is said, that treaties, made and ratified by the President and Senate, <HI>shall be supreme laws of the land.</HI> Persuaded that the nati∣on would abide by this its solemn declaration, seve∣ral powers made treaties with the President and Se∣nate, and, among others, Great Britain; but before the time for fulfilling a certain stipulation in the treaty with Great Britain is arrived, it becomes matter of doubt, whether this treaty be valid or not; or rather, one branch of the American go∣vernment declares it invalid, by a resolution entered on its journals. Under such circumstances, will
<PB N="153" REF="030221_0085_0FE528E44E2A4C08"/>
common reason or common sense deny, that the British would be justifiable in refusing to fulfill their part of the stipulations?</P>
<P>I have said, that Mr. Blount's resolution declares the treaty <HI>invalid.</HI> The word invalid is not made use of but we shall soon see that the resolution goes to the full length. The House, by adopting it, have formally and explicitly declared, that a treaty including commercial regulations, is not binding on the United States, till sanctioned by the House of Representatives. The present treaty includes commercial regulations, and therefore is <HI>not binding on the United States.</HI> The House have also declared in this resolution, that treaties including commercial regulations require the sanction of the House of Representatives before they can be effectual; or, in other words, that the ratification of the President and Senate is <HI>not sufficient to give such treaties their full and entire effect.</HI> The present treaty was, then, concluded and ratified by persons not fully empow∣ered so to do.</P>
<P>Now, the first principles, touching treaties, are; that, to be valid, <HI>the parties must have full power to conclude, ratify, and carry into effect;</HI> and that, the covenant must be <HI>equally binding and obligatory on both parties.</HI> The House of Representatives have declared, that the present treaty fails in both these points; they declare it invalid, and the British will certainly be permitted to believe them. Upon this ground it is, that, should the Governor of Canada deliver the posts, before the House has sanctioned the treaty, he would deserve to lose his head.</P>
<P>I will just stop here to observe; that, I dare say, it never entered into the heads of the wise Opposi∣tion,
<PB N="154" REF="030221_0086_0FE5294453D76050"/>
that Billy Pitt may, perhaps, play them a trick. Suppose he could gull the <HI>five</HI> sans-culotte kings with Canada, in exchange for St. Domingo? the <HI>Posts</HI> would go into the bargain, of course, and then we should have to dispute with our own dear kindred republicans for them. Take care, gentle∣men; now or never is the time to have them, take my word for it.</P>
<P>The treaty being invalid, all the other stipulations as well as that respecting the posts, will assuredly remain unfulfilled. The revisal of the sentences given in the courts of Vice Admiralty, and the appointment of commissioners for examining ap∣peals, &amp;c. will not take place; the consequence of which will be, the merchants of this country will lose about five or six millions of dollars. Indeed, Mr. Livingston, with a view of silencing these peo∣ple, has brought forward a resolution for paying these few millions out of the treasury of the United States. All the difference in this case will be, that the loss will be divided among us all; the hard∣working peasant and mechanic will be obliged to contribute towards an indemnification for a loss, incurred by adventurers and speculators.</P>
<P>Things will remain, then, with respect to Great Britain, just as they were before Mr. Jay went to England; we must, therefore, bring ourselves back to that epoch, and set out afresh.</P>
<P>The same alternative presents itself: a negociation or war. The President would prefer a negociation? but, can any one suppose, that he will ever enter into another? I shall, however, for a moment, ad∣mit this to be possible. I shall suppose him content to give up his adherence to the constitution, to receive
<PB N="155" REF="030221_0087_0FE5291F2E327E08"/>
his instructions from the House of Representatives, and to order his Envoy to confine himself within the bounds traced out by that House. I shall sup∣pose the Envoy arrived at the Court of St. James's; and, that all may be of a piece, I shall suppose this Envoy to be the immaculate <HI>Mr. Gallatin.</HI> If this respectable personage should be admitted to an in∣terview with Lord Grenville, of which I much doubt, the following dialogue would very probably take place</P>

Can it be possible that the Americans are so poor in talents, so debased in principle, as to entrust their public affairs to an European adventurer, the leader of an insurrection! Can these people be so degenerated. I blush to think them the offspring of Britons. Blessed for ever be the laws of Old England, that exclude all foreigners from public offices. These wretches are now tearing the government of America to pie∣ces, as the subtle and intriguing <HI>Neckar</HI> did that of France. They join themselves to the restless rabble of every country, flatter their passions and prejudi∣ces, make war upon the rich, divide the spoil, and then retire to their own country to devour it.</P>
</SP>
<P>I do not pretend to say, that the interview would be conducted exactly thus; but I am certain as to its result. I am certain that every offer to treat would be rejected with disdain. War, then, must be resorted to: not that war is the necessary conse∣quence of the violation of a treaty; but with the accumulated load of griefs and insults on both sides, and the irreconcileable hatred existing in this coun∣try
<PB N="158" REF="030221_0091_0FE528B634301B80"/>
against Great Britain, it is morally impossible to preserve peace.</P>
<P>The President and Senate are opposed to war; they know well its consequences to this country; but, who can tell what the President of next year may be? Can any man possibly hope, that General Washington will suffer himself to be degraded by remaining the pageant, the mere tool of a faithless and profligate faction. The reputation he has gain∣ed, it is not in the power of hell to wrest from him; hitherto he has been suffered to keep in the path of honour; but, one single step in the directi∣on he is now required to tread, and his renown is blasted for ever. No; if this treaty does not go into effect, it cannot be expected, it cannot be hoped, that he will again accept the post of Presi∣dent. Nor will any other man accept of it, who is attached to the present constitution. Some more pliant mortal must, then, be found; some prosti∣tuted friend of France, ready to sacrifice the inter∣ests of this country to the wild and bloody princi∣ples of the Convention. With such a President, and with such a majority in the House of Represen∣tatives, war with Britain would be inevitable.</P>
<P>War is at all times and to all countries dreadful in its effects, but to no country and at no time was it ever so dreadful as it would now be to America. This is not a warlike nation, nor has this nation a warlike government. In a war with any nation whatever, this country can gain nothing, and in a war with Great Britain it has every thing to lose.</P>
<P>When assertions like these are advanced, the ad∣vocates for war turn, with imaginary triumph, to
<PB N="159" REF="030221_0092_0FE528E5D18390F8"/>
the result of the last war. They tell us, that Ame∣rica was victorious, and that the country is now much more populous and rich than it was then.</P>
<P>In the first place, what did this country <HI>gain</HI> by the last war? If <HI>independence</HI> was a <HI>gain</HI> (for <HI>at pre∣sent</HI> that is very problematical) it was the only gain, I shall not dwell on the <HI>losses;</HI> those who have had their houses burnt about their ears; those who have been pillaged, plundered robbed of their property; those who are now starving with bundles of continental money under their roofs; those who have lost their children or their parents, do not need to be re∣minded of the losses of that war. If <HI>independence</HI> was the <HI>only gain</HI> of last war, what is to be the gain of another? The <HI>warriors</HI> do not pretend, that we could go and take Great Britain: they do not pre∣tend that we could take Jamaica: they do not pre∣tend even that we could take Bermuda. What then can we take? Why—<HI>Canada.</HI> This is the burthen of their song, or rather <HI>war-hoop.</HI> With this they divert the rabble, and sharpen their fangs for war and conquest. If you ask them <HI>how</HI> they would do this, they tell you that <HI>men</HI> are not want∣ing; that <HI>four hundred thousand</HI> would turn out volunteer against Great Britain. I believe twice that number would turn out for a field-day, with sticks and staves, and return very peaceably home to supper; but would they do this two days run∣ning? If I am to judge from experience; from the infinite difficulty the government had to assemble so trifling a force as fifteen thousand men on a re∣cent occasion, I should reduce this army of four hundred thousand men to three or four battalions. I shall be told, that the sentiments of the people concerning the <HI>excise</HI> were divided; and are they unan∣imous concerning the treaty? I will however suppose the people to have but one sentiment; I will suppose
<PB N="160" REF="030221_0093_0FE5295185D83358"/>
<HI>one</HI> hundred thousand men ready to submit them∣selves to all the rigour of military discipline, and all the hardships inseparable from actual service; I will suppose them all heroes, ready to <Q>seek the bubble honour in the cannon's mouth;</Q> and I will suppose a Washington at their head. Yet, these heroes must eat, and must have some kind of covering too, and this will cost money. In short, I have made a little calculation of the expence of <HI>fifty</HI> thousand men, <HI>ten</HI> armed vessels, <HI>ten</HI> galleys, with all the necessary officers, horses, waggons, cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and I find the amount to be above <HI>twenty millions of dollars</HI> annually, a sum three times as great as the <HI>present</HI> revenue of the United States. Can any sober man look at this, and imagine this country fit to engage in a war? There is not specie in the country sufficient to car∣ry on the war one month. As to loans, where are they to be obtained? in France, or in Holland? the very mention of those countries, on such a subject, excites laughter. Domestic loans; who will lend a sixpence? Taxes? there will be no∣thing but houses and land to tax. Commerce will be no more. The enemy will let nothing out of our ports, or into them. In a word, it is absolute∣ly impossible for this country to equip any thing like a creditable force, without having recourse to a <HI>paper currency and requisitions.</HI> I care not who dif∣fers from me in opinion, this opinion I give as my own, and, if war is declared, I shall see it verified.</P>
<P>As <HI>doing injury to Great Britain</HI> is the strongest stimulus to war in this country, I shall now take a view of the extent of that injury in the present in∣stance. As to the taking of Canada, I do not be∣lieve it probable. There are men in that country
<PB N="161" REF="030221_0094_0FE528B929FF5BA8"/>
as well as this, and they are better men, too, if we believe those debased wretches, who tell us, that one frenchman is worth three of their own an∣cestors. At any rate they are men, they are at home, they have eight or nine regular regiments, and a train of artillery, such as this country will not have in fifty years to come, Engineers and other experienced officers. When the <HI>warriors</HI> talk about taking Canada, they forget that there is any body to defend it. To be sure the poor de∣vils are <HI>subjects;</HI> but as they might get together twice the number of the <HI>citizens</HI> marched against them, there is a possibility, at least, that they might lay some few of the latter dead upon the field.</P>
<P>By sea, a war with this country would not add a dollar to the expences of Great Britain. She is already armed, and can very well spare a stout squadron for this coast. How this squadron <HI>might be employed</HI> I shall not point out; suffice it to say, that, if doing <HI>injury</HI> should be the object of the British Court, more could be done to us in one week, than we could do to Great Britain in ten years.</P>
<P>But, we should starve their islands: no such thing. He who is master of the sea, may call him∣self the master of the land. Those who have pro∣duce to sell, will sell it, in spite of decrees and ordinances. The British would obtain all they wanted, just as they now do, with this advantage, that they would prevent their enemies from doing the same. The more I contemplate this subject, the more I am convinced, that a war with Ameri∣ca would be favourable to the cause in which Great Britain is at present engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="030221_0095_0FE5295307D5CC60"/>Another reason for going to war, is; we should <HI>injure</HI> (always <HI>injure</HI>) the manufacturers in Great Britain; to which I beg may be added, we should leave ourselves naked. This latter may be a desir∣able object with the <HI>sans-culottes,</HI> though I should hardly imagine that Mr. <HI>Swanwick</HI> would much approve of it. People vainly suppose that the very existence of Great Britain depends on her com∣merce with this country: experience might have taught us the contrary: she can do without our trade for a dozen years at a time. Nor would such a contraction of her commerce at the present time, and <HI>in the present case,</HI> cause any discontent in that country. Our behaviour would unite the nation, and the Englishman that would not patient∣ly bear a temporary inconvenience or distress, that would not even spend his last shilling, to enable his king to revenge such an abominable trait of perfidy as the annulling of this treaty, ought to be stripped to his skin, nay of his skin into the bargain. The fact is, that, besides wanting the aid of France, this country would also want the aid of the English in this war: and this would be one of the great differences between this war and the last. Last war, addresses to the people of England did much: some of those who came to fight for the king, took very good care to fight against him: soldiers and sailors came to desert to their <HI>brothers,</HI> who were combatting in a cause, which was pretty generally looked upon as the cause of Britons. Things are now changed. <HI>Doctor Franklin,</HI> were he to rise from the dead, would not now be heard at the bar of the House of Lords. No English Lords, <HI>after the fate of Lord Chatham's statue</HI> at Charleston, will ever take upon him the cause of this country; un∣less, indeed, it be the Earl of Stanhope, who <HI>wishes
<PB N="163" REF="030221_0096_0FE529548B0BA6E8"/>
to be hanged.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such was really the fate of Lord Chatham's statue at Charleston, in the spring of 1794. Mr. <HI>William Pitt's</HI> Effigy was burnt in the same town, and on the same day.</NOTE> <HI>Doctor Priestley</HI> we have the happi∣ness to have among us, and therefore he can do his country no more harm. No; if we are to have war, let us come forward boldly like republicans, and tell the British we abhor and detest them. No wheedling, no coaxing. Let those who have burnt that nation's flag, and called for all the thunder bolts in the stores of heaven to be hurled on them, expect from them all the mischief they can possi∣bly do.</P>
<P>I know, that such language as this is unusual in this country. It would be much more pleasing to dwell on the power of the United States and the decrepid state of Great Britain; but I am no can∣didate for popular favour or applause. I delight in speaking hard truths; and besides, this is not the time for jesting or flattery.</P>
<P>I have hitherto proceeded upon the supposition, that the people of this country would be all unit∣ed in the cause of the war. But, how far would this be from the case! almost all the rich, almost all the people of property, would be opposed to it. There is another and still more dangerous kind of division, which would finally end in a dissoluti∣on of the Union: I mean the division of the North from the South. The enemies of peace, in the House of Representatives, are, with two honoura∣ble exceptions, to be found almost solely in the southern States. Can it be imagined, that the ho∣nest and industrious people of the north will suf∣fer themselves to be dragged down to perdition, merely to satisfy the unprincipled vengeance of a
<PB N="164" REF="030221_0097_0FE528E7535B0848"/>
nest of fraudulent debtors? Can it be imagined, that the New Englanders will tamely suffer the <HI>lords</HI> of Virginia to sport with their prosperity and happiness, as they do with their barrels of rice and tobacco at a cock-match? Common sense forbids us to believe any such thing.</P>
<P>I have supposed also, that the government would retain its present form; but, can this possibly be so? No; the moment a war should be declared, in consequence of the rejection of the treaty, the constitution would be thrown aside as useless lum∣ber. A revolutionary state must succeed. Then our Brissots and our Robespierres would mount the throne: we have them ready at hand, and a war is all that is wanting to bring them forth. We should have our <HI>aristocrats;</HI> indeed, they are already pointed out: the erection of a guillotine is all that remains for the <HI>patriots</HI> to do, preparatory to their execution. In short, do we envy the French their situation, or do we not? Do we wish to experience those sufferings, at the recital of which we now weep? Do we wish to witness all those cruelties, those frightful horrors, that freeze the blood and make us ashamed of our species? If we do, a war, at the present moment, will infallibly bring us the object of our wishes, and we shall do well to second the endeavours of the Livingstons, the Madisons and the Gallatins.</P>
<P>I am persuaded, that the following letter, from my <HI>Cousin Hedge-hog</HI> at New York, will not be unacceptable to my readers.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="165" REF="030221_0098_0FE529A05CA04AF8"/>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New York,</HI>
<DATE>21st <HI>April,</HI> 1796.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have long been a constant reader of your use∣ful works, and, as belonging to a branch of your family, I have taken to myself some part of the honour which their boldness and evident object re∣flect on the author; but, as my branch is a young∣er, or subaltern one, and as I have not had the folly to adopt the levelling principles of the sans-culottes of the present day, I have not 'till now presumed to intrude on your time, nor should I have done it at all, had not the Democratic tricks in this city seemed to call aloud for publicity.</P>
<P>Without further apology, then, I take the liber∣ty to inform you; that, yesterday, an assembly was held in the Bridewel-Fields (they were, you see, on their own dunghill) to re-damn the treaty, or, in other words to decide on a <HI>petition</HI> to <HI>order</HI> the House of Representatives not to pass the laws necessary for carrying it into effect. As all the merchants, and other inhabitants of credit and con∣sequence, had before signed a petition to a contrary effect, you will easily suppose of whom this Bride∣wel meeting was composed. The hour was, 12 o'clock, when <HI>labourers</HI> of every description were at leisure to attend. P. R. Liv—ton and M. Liv—ton (<HI>worthy</HI> relations of our <HI>nominal</HI> representative) were the leading orators. After these came their coadjutor, Francis Van D—ke, a chocolate grinder, known only for his stupid head, his rancourous heart, his sour phiz and the ridiculous bustle he made about the <HI>tricolored flag,</HI> that some wag had the liberticide impudence to tear down from the place where it was hoisted in our Coffee-House. This man was <HI>chairman</HI> of the meeting. The next ora∣tor was Serj—t Cl—ke, so consessedly in the pay
<PB N="167" REF="030221_0099_0FE529A7ED3DDD08"/>
of France, that he once actually sued G—net for not paying his <HI>secret services</HI> according to stipulated agreement. This "pretended patriot," previous to the meeting, advertized for the purpose of pur∣chasing <Q>several thousand of hoop-poles, to be used as <HI>junkets (alias</HI> bludgeons) on the day of parade.</Q></P>
<P>The complexion of the meeting was such, that, it is said, even the Liv—tons <HI>blushed</HI> at it. This, however, nobody, that knows the thickness of their skin, will believe. A petition was drawn up; but, as the assistants could not be supposed capable of signing their names, and, as in making their marks they must have rendered the paper as sooty as their own paws, a committee was appointed to sign for them, though the paws of this committee are cer∣tainly not much <HI>cleaner</HI> than those of the assembly in general.</P>
<P>What effect such a petition as this may have I know not: the sapient heads of the Opposition seem to be turned; but they may rest assured, that, if they have <HI>sold</HI> us to France, the bargain will notstand. They object to our treaty with Britain, because contracted without their consent, and we shall object to their treaty with France, because contracted without our consent. This is fighting them at their own weapons.</P>
<P>I must now call your attention to another event. On the 12th instant, one <HI>Kettlatas,</HI> whose offence was that of <HI>vilifying the assembly of the State,</HI> was set at liberty, and drawn in triumph through the streets, seated in an old ragged Pheaton, by the Guards of the city; I mean the Black-Guards.
<PB N="168" REF="030221_0100_0FE529C319FB13C8"/>
On this joyful occasion there was a sort of civic-fe∣stival. The French <HI>hulks,</HI> now lying in our har∣bour (where they have lain for nine months past, and where they will lie while there is an English armed ship at sea) decorated themselves in all their sans-culotte parafarnalia, usually exhibited at the triumph of savage anarchy over order and law.</P>
<P>Thus you see the close connection that every where exists between the French and the brutal enemies of our governments. These are insults that no government ever before put up with; in∣sults, I trust, we shall not long suffer with im∣punity.</P>

<P>P. S. Unfortunately, your intelligence, in the last <HI>Censor,</HI> concerning our malicious Argus (as far as relates to his decease) was not well founded. A <HI>French</HI> surgeon sewed up his neck, and the wretch is now dropping about his <HI>aqua fortis</HI> with as much malice as ever. Would not your quills and his eyes meet very lovingly together? My prickles are not long enough.</P>

<P><PB N="169" REF="030221_0101_0FE529D94AF32D48"/>N. B. This Censor, from a desire of inserting two of the Speeches on the call for papers, has been swelled to an unusual bulk; but, as the introduction to the work promises that no augmentation of price shall take place, that pro∣mise will be adhered to. Debates, however, cannot in future be admitted: want of room, from a crowd of other matter, will oblige the Editor to confine himself to remarks on them.</P>
