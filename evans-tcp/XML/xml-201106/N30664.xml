<P><HI>JOHN HAMMETT</HI> of the Town of <HI>Newport</HI> on <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> having furnish∣ed the World with an undoubted Instance in his own Person, of a Man abundantly given to Change, hath penn'd and sent to a certain Church Member, a few Days ago, a Paper, containing a Declaration or Confession of his Faith concerning our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and having been since waited upon, hath owned it to be his Faith, not∣withstanding he hath not subscribed it with his Name: And the same being in direct Opposition to Twelve Arguments of his in a Manuscript, now in Possession of another of the Church Members, it is thought fit, for the Benefit of himself and others, to present the Contents of the said Papers to the Public; together with an Argument of his against the Divinity of Jesus Christ, taken from another of his own Manuscripts. Only ad∣vertising the Reader, That his asserting or suggesting, that the Confession of his Faith, contained in his said Paper, <Q>always was
<PB N="4" REF="040687_0003_101680536C76B0C0"/>and is the Confession of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day,</Q> is certainly a very great Evil, false in Fact, and dishonourable to the said Churches: Witness those very Confessions of Faith which have been reprinted here in <HI>Newport,</HI> and which any Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compare with this of <HI>John Hammett,</HI> at Pleasure.</P>
<P>However, for the Satisfaction of many Readers, and saving them some Trouble, it is thought covenient to insert some Passages in this Place,</P>
<P>There is a Public Confession of Faith hanging up in a Frame in the Meeting House where <HI>J. Hammett</HI> used to assemble, and which hath been there many Years, and hath been lately reprinted in <HI>Newport,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Franklin.</HI> The third Article whereof, speaks thus: "That there is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all Things, who is the only begotten Son of God, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> being the true Lord and <HI>Root of Da∣vid,</HI> and also his Son and Offspring, accord∣ing to the Flesh; whom God freely sent in∣to the World, because of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave himself a Ransom for all, tasting Death for every Man,
<PB N="5" REF="040687_0004_101680566C009A48"/>a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World."</P>
<P>The seventh Article of the said Confession, speaks thus: "That there is one Holy Spirit, the <HI>precious</HI> Gift of God, freely given to such as obey him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Acts</HI> 5.32. that thereby they may be throughly sancti∣fied, and made able (without which they are altogether unable) to abide stedfast in the Faith, and to honour the Father and his Son Christ, the Author and Finisher of their Faith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these Three are One, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.7."—</P>
<P>There is also a Public Confession of Faith set forth by many of those Baptists who own the Doctrine of Universal Redemption; subscribed by certain Messengers, Pastors, Deacons, and Brethren, met at <HI>London,</HI> in Behalf of themselves, and many others, unto whom they did belong, in <HI>London,</HI> and in several Counties of the Nation, of the same Faith with them. Which Confession hath also been reprinted some Years ago in <HI>New∣port,</HI> by Mr. <HI>J. Franklin.</HI> The first Article
<PB N="6" REF="040687_0005_10168058940C2420"/>whereof, speaks thus: "We believe, and are very confident, that there is One, and but One living and true God, who is from everlasting to everlasting, and changeth not; without Body, Parts, or Passions, essentially present in all Places, of infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; the Maker and Preserver of all Things in Heaven and Earth, Visible and Invisible; and in this Divine and Infinite Being or Unity of the Godhead, there are Three Persons, the Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, of one Substance, Power, and Eternity: But as for all other Doctrines that are contrary and opposite to this abovesaid Article, we abhor and so∣lemnly protest against them."</P>
<P>The third Article of the said Confession is thus: "That the second Person in the Trinity, is the only begotten Son of God, who did in the Fulness of Time, take to himself of our Nature and Substance, in the Womb of the blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> of whom (in Respect of the Flesh) he was made, and so is true God, and true Man, our <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Christ, whom God the Father freely sent in∣to the World, because of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave himself a Ransom for All"—</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="040687_0006_1016805E730B0828"/>
This Confession of Faith being reduced to a short Compass, for the Benefit of weak Memories, and ignorant Persons: In that Form, the first Article is thus. "There is one God, an Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, Good, Merciful, Righteous, and Holy Spirit, who made the World, and all Things there∣in, out of Nothing; and is supream Ruler and Governor thereof."</P>
<P>The second Article is thus. "This one God is distinguished into Three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; the Father is the Creator, the Son the Redeemer, and the Holy Ghost the Sanctifier."</P>
<P>To this, let it be added: There is another Confession of Faith published by a very great Number of Baptist Churches, that held the the Doctrine of Personal Election and Final Perseverance, cited by Mr. <HI>Jos. Stennet</HI> in his Answer to Mr. <HI>Russen;</HI> which, as to the Matter in Hand, saith, as cited by Mr. <HI>Sten∣net,</HI> p. 112, 113. "The Son of God, the second Person in the Holy Trinity, being very and eternal God, the Brightness of the Father's Glory, of one Substance, and equal with him; who made the World, who up∣holdeth and governeth all Things he hath
<PB N="8" REF="040687_0007_1016806284B0AB18"/>made; did, when the Fulness of Time was come, take upon him Man's Nature, with all the essential Properties, and common In∣firmities thereof, yet without Sin, being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI>—and so was made of a Woman of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> of the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> according to the Scriptures. So that two whole, perfect, and distinct Natures were inseparably join'd to∣gether in one Person, without Conversion, Composition, or Confusion; which Person is very God and very Man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and Man."</P>

<HEAD><HI>J. Hammett</HI>'s Confession of Faith, taken from his own Manuscript.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"FOrasmuch as there having been of late, certain Opinions, which both by preach∣ing and writing, have been industriously pro∣pagated among us, which hath caused some Unea∣siness, and hath put us upon diligently search∣ing, and carefully examining, the plain Scrip∣tures of the New-Testament; and from thence we have collected the following Declaration of our Faith, which having Christ and his Apo∣stles
<PB N="9" REF="040687_0008_1016806647D62A20"/>for its Foundation, we therefore hope it will sufficiently protect us from the Imputation of Error; and also it may, by the Blessing of God, be Serviceable to others: We thought our∣selves conscientiously oblig'd to make it public.</HI></P>
<P>THAT in Respect of the real Substance, Nature, and Essence, of the true and only Christ, the only begotten Son of God, in whom God the Father dwelt, and to whom the Father gave the Spirit without Measure, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, and in whom God was manifest, and that God was in Christ, reconciling the World to himself, so as there never was such a Union between God and any other Man.</P>
<P>Him the Scriptures declare to be the Seed of the Virgin, miraculously conceiv'd in her Womb, by the Overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, and born of her Body, made of a Woman, and was the Son of Man, made like his Brethren in all Things, Sin only excepted; and was in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin, liable to the Bodily Frailties of Human Nature, he being a Mortal Man, and for our Sins died on the Cross, whom God raised from the
<PB N="10" REF="040687_0009_10168068D3495508"/>Dead, and exalted and dignified him far a∣bove all others, whether in Heaven or in Earth, the Father only excepted: For God hath given him a Name, which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jesus, every Knee should bow, whether of Things in Heaven or Things on Earth; and to him God committed all Power in Heaven and in Earth; and also God hath appointed and ordained this extraordinary Person to execute those two great Offices of a Mediator be∣tween God and Man; and also that of a Judge of the final and everlasting State of all Men: And this glorious and incompa∣rable Person, the Scriptures thus describes and sets forth, to be the compleat and only Object of Faith, God the Father only ex∣cepted; for Christ himself said, <HI>Ye believe in God, believe also in me:</HI> So that there is not any other Object of Faith recommended to us; for as to the Holy Ghost, or Power of the Highest, 'tis evident, that the Highest was his Father, by whose overshadowing Power (to whom Nothing is impossible) the Virgin conceived and brought forth her Son, and thus this Seed of the Woman, who was to bruise the Serpent's Head, became the
<PB N="11" REF="040687_0010_1016806E66F51948"/>only begotten Son of God, according as the Angel said to <HI>Mary; That Holy Thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God; and also he shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest.</HI> And that we might not be mistaken, by going farther back to find out his Original, or when he began to have a Being or Existence, and thereby overlook him, and have our Eye on some other Object instead of him, the Holy Ghost hath carefully provided against this Uncertainty, by informing us, That when he was disputing the Doctors in the Temple, he was then about Twelve Years of Age; and when he was baptized of <HI>John</HI> in the Ri∣ver of <HI>Jordan,</HI> he then began to be about Thirty Years of Age; so that Christ the Son of God could not pre-exist, or exist, be∣fore that Time, saving in the Ordination or Pre-determination of God, who calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were; and in this Sense and Way of speaking, he is said to be a <HI>Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> tho' 'tis evident, he was not really then in Being, much less to be then slain or crucified. And also <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="040687_0011_1016806FF6A0A268"/>But both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> explains this to be prophetically spoken, and to refer to his be∣ing begotten or raised from the Dead. So Christ also questioning with the <HI>Jews,</HI> he asked them, <HI>If</HI> David <HI>in Spirit call him Lord, how is he then his Son?</HI> Had these <HI>Jews</HI> understood, that <HI>David</HI> spake this in a pro∣phetic Stile; that is, That he was in Process of Time to be his Lord, and also his Son, tho' then he was really neither his Son nor his Lord, they need not to have been so puzzled about this so plain a Question. And thus abundance of seeming Difficulties may be easily reconciled and understood; for we are not under the ignorant Uncertainty, that the Disciples of <HI>John</HI> were, when they asked Christ, <HI>Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</HI> but thanks be to God, we can say with <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>Nathanael, We have found him, of whom</HI> Moses <HI>in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jesus of</HI> Nazareth. And this mean and low Character, tho' de∣spis'd by <HI>Nathanael</HI> as well as others, yet Christ was pleas'd particularly to chuse above all others, to describe himself by, when he appeared to <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' then in his most ex∣alted and resplendant Glory; <HI>I am Jesus of</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="040687_0012_10168073076C2580"/>Nazareth! So that we are not ashamed to own him, as being our great Lord and Ma∣ster; and in him therefore, we profess to believe, and with him we are fully satisfied and contented; and therefore, we are not amusing and puzzling ourselves, by looking out for another Christ, or Son of God, whom we never expect to find; for on this very Faith of Christ's Human Personality and Sufferings, he hath expressly founded and established the commemorative Communion, and as such, we all receive it. And also, that the Man Christ Jesus, whom the <HI>Jews</HI> crucified, and whom God raised from the Dead, the Apostles went every where preach∣ing to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> That he was the Son of God, and the only Saviour; and for this they suffered abundance of Persecution: So that this was their chief and principal Doctrine of Faith, and accordingly this was the Profession of Faith which the primitive Converts made, and which was accepted by the Apostles on their Admission to Baptism; and so this always was, and is the Confession of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day. <HI>Luke</HI> 6.22, 23. <HI>Blessed are ye, when Men shall hate you, and when they
<PB N="14" REF="040687_0013_1016807515BFEEA0"/>shall separate you from their Company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your Name as evil, for the</HI> Son of Man's <HI>Sake: Rejoice ye in that Day, and leap for Joy, for behold your Reward is great in Heaven."</HI></P>

"IF none but God could raise the Dead to Life, and Christ had this Power in himself, then he must be God.</P>
<P>But none but God could raise the Dead to Life, and Christ had this Power in him∣self;</P>

<P><HI>John</HI> 11.25, 43, 44. <HI>I am the Resurrec∣tion and the Life. And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud Voice,</HI> Lazarus <HI>come forth: And he that was dead came forth.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. <HI>For as in</HI> Adam <HI>all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</HI></P>
<P>If none but God could give Spiritual Life to the Souls of Men, being spiritually dead, and quicken them to a spiritual Life, and Christ could do this, then he must be God.</P>
<P>But none but God could give spiritual Life to the Souls of Men, being spiritually dead, and quicken them to a spiritual Life, and Christ could do this;</P>

If none but God could forgive Men's Sins, and Christ could forgive them, then he must be God:</P>
<P>But none but God could forgive Men's Sins, and Christ could and did forgive them;</P>
<P>Therefore it follows, that he must be God: As well as Man.</P>
<P><HI>Matt.</HI> 9.2, 6. <HI>Son be of good Cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee. But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins.</HI></P>
<P>If none but God could know the secret Thoughts of Men's Hearts, and the secret Actions of their Lives; and Christ did know them, then he must be God.</P>

<P>If no Man could quicken his own dead

<P>The End of the Arguments.</P>
<P>The Reader may be pleased to know, That presently after the Work of transcribing these Papers was finished, the above Con∣fession of Faith appeared in print, without any material Alteration from what it is in the Manuscript, subscribed by <HI>John Hammett</HI> and two other Men. The Copier of these Papers was extreamly sorry to see the Names of these two Men in that Place and Com∣pany; and doubts not but the same will be an Occasion of great Grief to many others. It is to be feared, and yet it may be hoped, that they have put a great deal too much Confidence in their Scribe. However, such Events are not to be thought altogether
<PB N="21" REF="040687_0020_1016808D0B3E0570"/>strange: because the great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> hath long since said, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.29, 30. —<HI>I know this, that after my departing, shall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not sparing the Flock. Also of your ownselves shall Men arise, speaking perverse Things, to draw away Disciples after them.</HI></P>
