<HEAD>TO THE READER <HI>Desirous of KNOWLEDGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE soul of man being a spark of im∣mortality, infused by its Almighty Maker, does still retain a relish of its original, that it covets knowledge above all other things, not confining its speculation to earth, but towering to Heaven, it searcheth out the Stars and all their various influences; nay, rifles all the Constellations, unlocking all the secret cabinet of futurity, and diving into the vast abysses of things un∣known: For man
<Q><L>Dame Nature's secret working doth inspect,</L>
<L>He knows how to advise, what to direct:</L>
<L>Into the world, by art and science brings,</L>
<L>And searcheth out the hidden birth of things.</L>
<L>The unplow'd earth he to his will subdues,</L>
<L>And all it brings forth, he knows how to use:</L>
<L>He seeks out <HI>JOVE:</HI> his thoughts will not be try'd,</L>
<L>In vain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Stars themselves do hide.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now to satisfy the inquisitive nature of the soul of man, is the design of this book, which will gratify his understanding with the knowledge of the most hiden secrets of art and nature, which the wisdom of the an∣cients have hitherto concealed, but here made plain to the meanest capacities.</P>

<P>ONE part of the wisdom of the ancients consisted in the observation of several days and times, and from thence foretelling such good and bad events, as from long experience they found always to follow: And therefore revising what ancient astrologers have said, which I found very defective, I have myself made an exact judgment of what should befal men, women and children, by the day of the week on which the first day of the year happened to fall: As if it hap∣pened to fall on a</P>
<P><HI>Sunday.]</HI> The winter following will be pleasant, the summer seasonable; there shall be plenty of corn, though the weather in harvest will prove but indiffer∣ent: Fruit shall very much abound, and there will be a very good seed time following the harvest; shocks of sheep and great cattle shall increase and prosper, but
<PB N="6" REF="030393_0005_0FE6C409CB0B54E0"/>
there shall be robberies in most places, and perhaps war before the end of the year: Also it denotes the death of prelates and princes, dissention and discord among men, but not of long continuance.</P>
<P><HI>Monday.]</HI> If New Year's Day fall on <HI>Monday,</HI> ex∣pect a hard and cold winter, and a wet summer, and as a consequence of that, many diseases; the fruits of the earth very indifferent, which will produce great scarcity in some places: Also denotes the downfal of the gentry and many marriages among the common people.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday.]</HI> If on <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the winter shall be wet and the summer very dry; hay will be scarce, but corn indifferently plenty. Many factions and divisions among those that sit at the helm, and a great mortal∣ity both of men and beasts.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday.]</HI> If on <HI>Wednesday</HI> it denotes the first part of the winter very hard and severe, but the last part very mild and gentle, a seasonable spring and plenty of fruit; but great sickness and many distempers about autumn. Many fables, with false news, shall be spread abroad, and much discontent among the common people.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday.]</HI> If on <HI>Thursday,</HI> you may look for a hard winter, but a seasonable and moderate spring, and a great increase of the fruits of the earth; sheep and great cattle shall also prosper much, but towards autumn expect to hear of war and bloodshed abroad, and troubles at home, occasioned by contests and di∣visions among the clergy.</P>
<P><HI>Friday.]</HI> If on <HI>Friday,</HI> look for an extreme hard winter, a late spring, and a dry summer; corn very dear, and fruit very dear, very high winds, occasion∣ing shipwrecks; cattle will die generally: Women will have very hard labours, and most others very loose and licentious; thunder and lightning will be very frequent, and do much mischief.</P>

<HEAD>Of Astrology; what it is.</HEAD>
<P>ASTROLOGY is the Art that teach∣es us the influence and effects of the Celestial Planets upon the bodies of men, women and children, which by their various aspects, positions and configurations, do foreshew the changes and mutations both of par∣ticular bodies, and also of kingdoms and states.</P>
<P>Some would confound Astronomy and Astrology together, which are in truth different things: And both have their particular use and excellence. Astron∣omy teaches the various and different motions of the planets, and astrology shews their influences and effects; but now that of the signs and planets more distinctly. And first the twelve signs of the Zodiac, which gov∣ern the several parts of man's body, and are summed up in verse.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Triplicity of the Twelve Signs.</HEAD>
<P>THESE signs are also divided by as∣trologers in their several triplicities according to their several natures; thus <HI>Aries, Leo</HI> and <HI>Sagittary,</HI> being all hot and dry, are called the fiery triplicity; <HI>Taurus, Virgo</HI> and <HI>Capricorn,</HI> being all cold and dry, are called the earthly triplicity; <HI>Gemini, Libra</HI> and <HI>Aquarius,</HI> being all hot and moist, are called the airy triplicity; and <HI>Cancer, Scorpio</HI> and <HI>Pisces,</HI> being all cold and moist, are called the watry triplicity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Twelve Houses.</HEAD>
<P>THE knowledge and the nature of the houses is reckoned by the ancients a great mystery, and that which requires great study; for there is nothing relating to man's life but it is foreshewn by the nature of one of the twelve houses, whose significations are briefly summed up in the following verse.
<Q><L>The first house shews life, the second wealth doth give,</L>
<L>The third how brethren, the fourth how parents live,</L>
<L>Issue the fifth, the sixth diseases bring,</L>
<L>The seventh wedlock, and the eighth death's sting,</L>
<L>The ninth religion, the tenth honor s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws,</L>
<L>Friendship the eleventh, and the twelfth our w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L></Q></P>
<P>The first house is called the ascendant; because there the sun ascends the horizon, let it be in what climate it will; and in astrological judgment is called the house of life.</P>
<P>The second house is the succedent to the ascendant, and is the signification of riches and wealth.</P>
<P>The third house is the signification of bretheren, kindred and alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030393_0010_0FE6C44E4393B1F8"/>The fourth house signifies the parents of the native, and all possessions, and lands of inheritance.</P>
<P>The fifth house is the succedent of the angel of the earth, which is the fourth house and, therefore signifies mirth and jollity, which is usually the effect of the birth of children, which is also signified by this house.</P>
<P>The sixth house is cadent from the north angle, and is significant of sickness and diseases.</P>
<P>The seventh house is the angel of the west, and is significator of wedlock, and also of lawsuits and quar∣rels.</P>
<P>The eighth house is succedent from the angel of the west, and signifies death.</P>
<P>The ninth house is cadent, and signifies religion and learning.</P>
<P>The tenth house signifies dignity, honour, and pre∣ferment.</P>
<P>The eleventh house hath significations of friendship, amity, and hope.</P>
<P>The twelfth house signifies misery, poverty, private enemies, imprisonments and disgrace.</P>

<HEAD>How many Persons may know under which of the twelve Signs they are born.</HEAD>
<P>HE that is born under <HI>Aries</HI> is of a nature hot and dry, and of a loud voice, inclined to choler; and if a woman, subject to barrenness, or at least will have but few children, and those sickly and perhaps wanting in some of their members; very desirous of command, and loving to be above others: Such have also black eyebrows, thick shoulders, and are of a dark swarthy complexion, and of a middle stature.</P>
<P>Those born under <HI>Taurus</HI> are of a cold and dry con∣stitution, inclined to melancholy, one that is sickly, and loves pleasure, yet is very chaste, honest and religious; seldom angry, but once peovoked seldom reconciled;

<P>Persons born under <HI>Gemini</HI> are hot and moist, of fair and sanguine complexions, and affable and cour∣teous in their behaviour, endued with wisdom and un∣derstanding, and accomplished with elegance of speech and a good delivery, having brown hair, brisk and quick eyes, a large breast, long arms, hands and legs; and a tall, straight and well set body.</P>
<P>Those born under <HI>Cancer,</HI> which is a watery sign, are cold and moist, and of a phlegmatic constitution; of a low stature, blackish hair, and a great belly. If it be a woman, it shews she shall have many children.</P>
<P>Those that are born under <HI>Leo</HI> (which is hot and dry, and a sign of the fiery triplicity) are very choleric, of a shrill voice, and viciously inclined; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h addict∣ed to anger, and very subtile; if a woman, barren, of a generous and free temper, very valiant and cour∣ageous, of yellowish or flaxen hair, broad shouldered, great head and eyes, of middle stature, but lusty body.</P>
<P>Persons born under <HI>Virgo,</HI> which is a sign of the earthly triplicity, are cold and dry, of a melancholy constitution, but of a free countenance, very courteous of behaviour, and yet very self opinioned, the body somewhat spare, but of a good proportion, of a brown complexion, but black hair, and large eyes.</P>

they are also of a sad coloured hair, and of a serious and grave countenance, very much reserved, but at the same time false and deceitful; the stature is com∣monly small, but the body is pretty well set.</P>
<P>Those that are born under <HI>Sagittary</HI> which is a sign of the fiery Triplicity, are hot and dry, choleric, tall of stature, hard favoured, but fair; brown hair, which will shed betimes.

<HEAD>Of the seven Planets, their characters, names, natures; and in what times they make their Revolutions.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING spoke of the several signs, with the twelve houses, and of their natures and sig∣nifications, I come now to speak of the seven planets, or erratic stars, who in their several orbs or circles, pass through the twelve houses of the <HI>Zodiack</HI> in more or less time, according to the largeness or smallness of their several orbs; and as these planets pass through the twelve signs, so they are said to be in such and such houses; thus the complement of one year, for on the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> at which time the spring and most properly the year begins, the sun enters in <HI>Aries,</HI> and having passed through that, in <HI>April</HI> he enters into <HI>Taurus,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> into <HI>Gemini,</HI> and so of the rest. And according to the houses or signs in which any of the planets are, so they are said to be dignified or debilita∣ted; for when a planet is in a sign of its own nature, it is dignified; but if in a sign of a contrary nature to its own, it is then debilitated, or made weaker; and according to their position, their effects and operations are wonderful upon the bodies of men and women; but I shall give you their characters, names, and na∣ture.</P>
<P>The first is ♄ <HI>Saturn,</HI> who is by nature cold and dry, of a swarthy, dull, obscure colour, like unto lead; he makes his revolution through the twelve signs in thir∣ty years.</P>
<P>The second is ♃ <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who is by nature hot, moist, and temperate, he appears very bright and shin∣ing, and is of a warm nature; he makes his revolution in twelve years.</P>
<P>The third is ♂ <HI>Mars,</HI> of nature hot and dry, he ap∣peareth of a fiery colour, and maketh his revolution in twenty three months.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030393_0014_0FE6C45081FA64B8"/>The fourth is ☉ <HI>Sol,</HI> whose nature is hot, dry, and temperate; his glorious brightness is sufficiently known to all. He makes his revolution in three hun∣dred and sixty five days, six hours and twentyfour minutes.</P>
<P>The fifth is ♀ <HI>Venus,</HI> of nature cold and moist, the most bright and splendent star in all the firmament, she moveth equally with the Sun, though her motion seems to be very irregular, and makes her revolution at the same time.</P>
<P>The sixth is ☿ <HI>Mercury,</HI> whose nature is cold and dry, variable, he is situated very near the Sun, and is rarely seen; he makes his revolution at the same time as the Sun and Venus.</P>
<P>The seventh is ☽ <HI>Luna,</HI> or the Moon, which is the last or lowest, and whose nature is cold and moist, ev∣ery one knows she is of a pale colour, and she maketh her revolution in twentyseven days and eight hours.</P>
<P>Having given you a brief account of the names and nature of the seven planets, I here add an account of the five aspects also, which are these:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the five Aspects.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ☌ <HI>CONJUNCTION,</HI> which is when two planets are in one sign, or thirty degrees.</P>
<P N="2">2. ✶ <HI>Sextile,</HI> which is when two planets are distant two signs or sixty degrees.</P>
<P N="3">3. □ <HI>Quartile,</HI> which is when two planets are dis∣tant three signs, or ninety degrees.</P>
<P N="4">4. △ <HI>Trine,</HI> which is when two planets are distant four signs, or one hundred and twenty degrees.</P>
<P N="5">5. ☍ <HI>Opposition,</HI> which is when two planets are dis∣tant six signs, or one hundred and eighty degrees.</P>
<P>These are also two opposite points in the ecliptic line, called <HI>Nodes,</HI> which we commonly call the <HI>Drag∣ons
<PB N="16" REF="030393_0015_0FE6C41590DB9128"/>
head</HI> and <HI>tail,</HI> thus characterised, ☊ <HI>Dragon's Head,</HI> ☋ <HI>Dragon's Tail.</HI></P>
<P>I would now shew you the various effects and op∣erations of the seven planets, as they are posited in the several houses, but I think it most necessary to give you an explanation of several terms used in the astronom∣ical and astrological science.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An explanation of the Circle of the Sphere, and some other Terms in Astronomy, for the easier understanding of this Book, and for further information of the reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Equinoctial Circle, Equator,</HI> or <HI>E∣quinox,</HI> is a great circle or line equally distant from the two poles of the world, dividing the sphere in the midst.</P>
<P><HI>Zodiack,</HI> is a broad oblique circle crossing the Equi¦noctial in two opposite places, <HI>viz.</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Aries</HI> and the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> so that half declining towards the <HI>north,</HI> the other towards the <HI>south;</HI> and in this circle is comprehended the twelve constellations of signs, every sign containing thirty degrees in length, and twelve in breadth. <HI>Note</HI> also, That the first are northern signs, and the six last are southern signs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ecliptic Line,</HI> is a line imagined to go along the midst of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> as a girdle out of which the sun never goeth; but the moon and other planets are sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other side, which is called their latitudes, only the fixed stars alter not their latitude, whether great or small; but the longitude of a star is in the arch or part of the <HI>Ecliptic</HI> in degrees, between the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and the cir∣cle which passeth through the body of the star; where <HI>note,</HI> that all circles of the sphere or heavens, whether they are large or small, have three hundred and sixty degrees allowed to each of them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030393_0016_0FE6C45091F7FDA8"/><HI>Colures</HI> are said to be two great moveable circles crossing each other at the poles of the world, one cut∣ting the Equinox at the beginning of <HI>Aries</HI> and at the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> and the other cutting the Ecliptic at the beginning of <HI>Cancer</HI> and at the beginning of <HI>Ca∣pricorn;</HI> and so dividing the globe into four equal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Horizon</HI> is a great circle which divideth the upper hemisphere, that is the upper hall of the world from the lower, we being always supposed to be in the midst.</P>
<P><HI>Meridian</HI> is a great circle passing through the poles of the world, and the poles of the horizon, called <HI>Ze∣nith</HI> and the <HI>Nadir</HI> (which are two points, one di∣rectly over our heads the other directly under our feet) on which the sun is always just at noon; and to go di∣rectly north and south, the meridian is changed; but to go east and west it is changed to sixty miles either way, and make one degree, of four minutes of time dif∣ference under the Equinox, <HI>viz.</HI> sixty miles eastward, it is noon four minutes sooner, and sixty miles west∣ward four minutes later.</P>
<P><HI>Tropicks</HI> are supposed to be two lesser circles, paral∣lel with the Equinoctial, and distant from it on either side, twenty three degrees, thirty one minutes each; the ecliptic line touches the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> on the north side of the equinoctial, and it touches the <HI>Tropic</HI> of <HI>Capricorn</HI> on the south side thereof, so that the sun hath its motion between these two circles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Artick Circle</HI> is equally distant from the north pole, as the <HI>Tropicks</HI> are distant from the <HI>Equinox</HI> twen∣ty three degrees, thirty one minutes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antarctic Circle</HI> is the same distance from the south pole.</P>
<P><HI>Zones,</HI> so called are five in number, two cold, two temperate and one hot, which are divided by the two <HI>Tropicks</HI> and polar circles from each other; the hot
<PB N="18" REF="030393_0017_0FE6C415A0500C88"/>
Zone is counted between the two <HI>Tropicks</HI> that is ex∣tended from one to the other, being about forty seven degrees two minutes broad; the temperate Zones are extended from the <HI>Tropicks</HI> on either side, to about fortytwo degrees sixtyeight minutes, that is northward to the <HI>Artick</HI> circle and southward to the <HI>antarctick</HI> cir∣cle and the two cold Zones are each within those two small circles having the poles for their center.</P>
<P>The <HI>poles of the Worlds,</HI> are two points exactly oppo∣site to each other in the heavens, one in the north, the other in the south, the earth being in the midst, so that it seems to turn about, as if it were borne up by them; wherefore by some it is termed the axletree of the world, as if there was a line supposed to be drawn from one pole through the center of the earth to the other, and the earth turning thereon, though holy writ tells us, <HI>The Lord hangeth the earth upon nothing, it being upholden by his mighty power.</HI> The pole artick, or north pole, is elevated above our horizon above fiftyone degrees; and those stars within that distance from it, never set with us, but keep their course round it daily; so likewise those that are at that distance from the south pole, never rise with us, but perform their course in the like order.</P>
<P><HI>Azimuths</HI> are supposed lines or circles of distance from the meridian, drawn from the zenith to any de∣gree, or two degrees of the horizon, or according to the thirty two points of the mariner's compass, so that in travelling or sailing any way supposing a circle to go from our zenith directly before us to the horizon, is the <HI>Azimuth,</HI> called the verticle point as well as the ze∣nith.</P>
<P><HI>Almicantharats,</HI> or <HI>Almadarats,</HI> or circles of altitude, are imagined circles passing through the meridian, parallel with the horizon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sphere</HI> is a round body, presenting the frame of the whole world, as the circles of the heaven and the
<PB N="19" REF="030393_0018_0FE6C4582CAB2A58"/>
earth; this is sometimes called a martial sphere, for the orbs of the planets are called their spheres, that is the circles in which they move.</P>
<P><HI>Ascension</HI> is the rising of any star, or of any part of the ecliptic above the horizon, <HI>Descension</HI> is its going down.</P>
<P><HI>Right ascension of a star,</HI> is that part of the equinox that riseth or setteth with a star in a right sphere, but in an oblique sphere, it is that part of the equinoctial in degrees, containing between the first point of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that place of the equinoctial which passeth by the meridian with the center of the star.</P>
<P><HI>Oblique Ascention</HI> is a part of the equinoctial in de∣grees, contained betwixt the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that of the equinox, which riseth with any star, or part of the ecliptic, in an oblique sphere.</P>
<P><HI>Assential difference,</HI> is the difference betwixt the right and oblique ascention, or the number of degrees con∣tained between that place and the equinox that riseth with the center of a star, and that place of the equinox that cometh to the meridian with the same star.</P>
<P><HI>Solstice</HI> is in the summer, when the sun is in the be∣ginning of <HI>Cancer;</HI> and in the winter when the sun en∣ters into <HI>Capricorn;</HI> because then the days seem to stand still, and seem neither to increase nor decrease above two minutes in ten or twelve days.</P>
<P><HI>Constellation</HI> is a certain number of stars, supposed to be limited within some form or likeness, as <HI>Aries</HI> the ram, is said to have thirteen stars; <HI>Taurus</HI> the bull thirtythree: <HI>Arcturus, Orion</HI> and the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> mention∣ed in <HI>Job.</HI> ix. 9. are said to be <HI>Constellations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perihelium</HI> is the point wherein the earth, or any planet, is nearest the sun.</P>
<P><HI>Aphelium</HI> is a point wherein the earth, or any planet, is farther from the sun.</P>
<P><HI>Planets,</HI> are the seven eratique or wandering stars, called, <HI>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol,</HI> or the Sun, <HI>Venus,
<PB N="20" REF="030393_0019_0FE6C41D792E0BD8"/>
Mercury</HI> and <HI>Luna,</HI> or the Moon, whose characters, names and nature, we have mentioned before, and whose influences we shall by and by give you a farther account of. Those planets have also their several mo∣tions. As,</P>
<P><HI>Direct.</HI> Is a planet's moving in its natural course, which is forward.</P>
<P><HI>Retrogade.</HI> Is their moving backward contrary to their direct motion.</P>
<P><HI>Combust.</HI> Is their being under the sun beams, or within eight degrees of him.</P>
<P><HI>Oriental.</HI> Is when a planet riseth before the sun, <HI>Occidental,</HI> after him.</P>
<P><HI>Latitude of the Earth,</HI> is the distance of breadth on either side of the equinox, towards the pole, and they that are under the equinox have no latitude, but the poles of the world are in the horizon: This is a right sphere, and every sixty miles directly north or south, are said to make no degree of latitude, and the height of either pole above the horizon, is answerable to the degree of latitude in an oblique sphere; as London is counted to be in latitude fiftyone degrees, thirtytwo minutes, the pole thereof being elevated as much. The like is to be observed in any other place or region.</P>
<P><HI>Longitude of the Earth,</HI> is the outside thereof extend∣ed from west to east, crossing the latitude at right an∣gles, the beginning thereof (according to some astrono∣mers) is the <HI>Canary Isles,</HI> so going eastward quite round the world, unto the same place again, which is three hundred and sixty degrees; and under the equinoctial is reputed to be two millions one thousand six hundred miles, reckoning sixty miles to a degree; but then further off the equinoctial, the fewer miles are in a de∣gree; for at <HI>London</HI> about thirtyseven makes a degree of longitude: so these degrees grow less and less, until they are met in the latitude of ninety, that is under the poles.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030393_0020_0FE6C4583B515D20"/><HI>Parallels,</HI> are lines straight and circular, equally dis∣tant from each other, as the Equinox, Tropicks, and degrees of latitude, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Climate,</HI> or <HI>Clime,</HI> is such a space of earth compre∣hending between two parallels, in which space there is half an hour's difference in the sun dials, and length of the days.</P>
<P><HI>Antipodes,</HI> are those whose feet are directly against ours, as if a line was drawn from one through the cen∣ter of the earth to the other.</P>
<P>And these shall suffice for an explanation of things, which I have done as briefly as I could, for he ad∣vantage of the reader, to whom possibly these things (so necessary to be known) may have hitherto been concealed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sun's Revolution through the <HI>12</HI> Sings of the Zo∣diac; with an Astrological Judgment of those that shall be born, when the Sun is in any of these Signs.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there be seven planets (as we have before shewed) yet the sun and moon being the two great luminaries of the world, have greater influ∣ence upon our bodies than all the rest, and the sun shining by his ow light, and being the fountain of both light and life, has greater power than the moon, and his influence is more in any of the twelve houses. I therefore here (because I affect brevity) give the reader an astrologic judgment of the sun's power and influence, being in any of the twelve houses; after I have first ac∣quainted my reader what a house is, and signifies in astrology.</P>
<P>A house is a certain space in the firmament, which is parted and separated by several degrees, by which the planets have their motion metaphorically, called houses.
<PB N="22" REF="030393_0021_0FE6C3F656F2DCD8"/>
For as in a house there may be many mansions, for eve∣ry planet has a peculiar or proper place in the firmament, in which it moves and in which it is resident, contain∣ing thirty degrees, by which one house is differenced from another, and these are thus placed by Astrologers, viz.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Aries,</HI> makes a person born under it of a toward and peevish disposition, quickly angry, but as soon pleased; given to study and very eloquent, but proud, living luxurious, promising all things, but performing nothing; not beloved among his kindred, and obnoxious to danger among his enemies; he shall be in danger of receiving harm from four footed beasts, or being thrown from a horse, and the like; so that he ought to avoid all hawking, hunting, and oth∣er exercise to be performed on horsecback, which are like to be fatal to him, but in other things he may be more fortunate. If the person born be a female, though she may be fair and fruitful in children, yet she will be given to lying, and of so bad a temper and disposition that her husband will live but uneasy with her. <HI>Note,</HI> this also, that those born in the day time, the sun being in <HI>Aries,</HI> will be fortunate aad happy, but those that are born in the night, will be unfortunate and come to disgrace.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Taurus,</HI> makes the native bold and fortunate in attempting hard and difficult affairs; it shews him also victorious over his enemies, and a great traveller, but banished from his native country. It also shews one servile, familiar and angry, but in his old age only; for in his youth he shall obtain rich∣es by marriage, which shall make him better honored. But when age comes, it brings sickness with it, and that makes men peevish.</P>
<P>It makes females wanton, yet painful and obedient, but full of <HI>Tittle Tattle;</HI> it also shews them inclined to whoredom, which will wear off by degrees; she shall have many husbands and divers children.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030393_0022_0FE6C45C598CD520"/>The sun being in <HI>Gemini,</HI> denotes a fair child, also one that is wise, liberal and merciful, also a boaster, and one that runs up and down without any regard to his business, whereby he shall obtain but little riches of his own, but shall be of that fidelity and truth, that he shall have the command of the public treasure: It also denotes one to be of a complaisant behaviour, a good understanding, and acceptable to those with whom he has to do. It shews him also to be well vers∣ed in the mathematical science and arithmetic; and that he shall be in great danger about three and twen∣ty years of age, either to be hurt by fire, or bitten by a mad dog.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Cancer,</HI> shews a person to be of a good wit, humility and wisdom, but one inclined to pleasure, and the love of women. It also shews one attempting many things, and especially on seas, and thereby often in danger, and vexed with many incom∣modities, and with much poverty and misery, and that though he may get much, yet he may be never the richer; he shall dig for treasure, and shall find that which he looked not for: But if it be a maid, she shall be witty, shamefaced, evil, wise, diligent, nimble and beautiful, soon pleased, yet deceitful and crafty, saying one thing, and doing another, subject to many dangers by water, by falling, by childbearing and chol∣ic; and after the age of twentysix, whether the native, male or female, it promiseth good success. It denotes also a person to be painful, faithful, acquainted with great men, and fortunate in husbandry.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Leo,</HI> denotes a man proud and ar∣rogant, bold and stout; a mocker, scorner, unmerciful, cruel, and hard to be entreated; beset with many ene∣mies, and subject to many miseries; also a captain or other commander, looking for promotion from great men, unfortunate children, and meeting with many af∣flictions by their means, putting himself into many dangers; he shall be also in danger by fire or sword, and
<PB N="24" REF="030393_0023_0FE6C420CFBD4430"/>
violence of beasts, by whom he shall be in danger of death; but with prudence may escape all threatened dangers.</P>
<P>But if the native be of the female sex, she shall be bold, have great and large breasts, and slender legs, which are tokens of stoutness, angers, slanders, and bab∣bling; though the softness natural to women do allevi∣ate the excess thereof. She ought however to be es∣pecially careful of hot waters, and fire, by which she will be in great danger; she shall also be much inclined to sickness, or gnawing of the stomach. But after the age of twentyone years, she shall be fortunate in riches, which she shall obtain by the help of great men, and the use of other men's goods: also by housekeeping, beauty and love.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Virgo,</HI> makes the men fortunate and successful in houshold affairs, wise and fruitful, stout and ambitious: his wife shall die suddenly in his absence; he shall have many things stolen from him, but shall be revenged on his enemies. He shall be so much given to talk, that he cannot keep his own se∣crets.— It also shews one fairfaced, of a genteel beha∣viour, a lover of women, and delightful to be in the courts of princes and noblemen. It also denotes one wise, just, and honorable, a patron and defender of his friends, also religious and temperate, of a comely per∣sonage, and well featured. If the native be a maiden, she will be witty, honest and modest; of a willing mind diligent and circumspect; and shall be married about the age of fifteen years. But whether male or female, they shall be liable to meet with many afflictions.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Libra,</HI> denotes the person to be for∣tunate in all maritime affairs, and that he gains by trad∣ing in spices and precious stones. It also shews a come∣ly body, and a valuable pleasant tongue, a good fame, and one curious to understand secrets, but not very careful to perform what he promises, how much soever he may pretend to it. It shews also that he shall
<PB N="25" REF="030393_0024_0FE6C45C69591540"/>
have several wives, and that he shall quickly bury the first. He may also be a gainer by dead men, who will leave him large legacies. He shall be a lover of wom∣en and entertain unlawful familiararities with them. He shall be also a good interpreter of dreams, whether he be born by day or night. If the native be of the female sex, she shall be free and debonair, and of a jo∣cund humour, taking much delight in herbs, loving the fields, and wandering into strange places. About 23 years of age she shall have a husband, and be happy, married for her beauty; pleasantness of conversation, and good behaviour, shall much promote her. Like∣wise the children of <HI>Libra</HI> are such as are studious and lovers of learning; but without special care be taken, they may receive prejudice by fire or scalding water.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Scorpio</HI> increases the natives in∣heritence, and give them a boldness and stoutness, in∣clining them likewise to flattery, by which means those they deal with are often deceived; and when they ex∣pect bread may meet with nothing but a <HI>scorpion.</HI> It likewise denotes a person full of mirth, given to jest∣ing and easy of belief, at the same time a conquerer of his enemies. It makes a woman to be full of craft and wit, and yet her husband shall deceive her. She shall likewise be subject to pain and the spleen, and have some extraordinary mark, either in the head, shoulder, or brawn of the arm.</P>
<P>It makes both sexes bold and rash, given to thiev∣ing, and to search out hidden things, also it makes them wanton fornicators, and full of evil thoughts, and given to too much talking.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Sagittary,</HI> gives fortune and bold∣ness to take in hand an enterprise, inclining a person to travel, and take vovages at sea and journies by land, and not without considerable advantage; it also gives access into courts of princes, where the native shall be advanced to some honourable post. It also shews a per∣son given to riding, hunting, hawking, leaping, fight∣ing
<PB N="26" REF="030393_0025_0FE6C420DF0FC458"/>
and such manly exercises, at which he always comes off with honor, by which means he is envied and has many enemies, whom yet he shall vanquish and and overcome. It also shews he shall possess the inher∣itence of his father, and that he shall be just, ingeni¦ous, faithful, hearty, a sure friend, and a generous en∣emy. If the native be a woman, it likewise betokens the same; she shall be industrious, of an excellent temper; she shall be envied by her enemies, but shall overcome them; she shall be married about seventeen, and have many children.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Capricorn,</HI> shews the native shall meet with many afflictions and adversities, which he shall sustain with many resolutions: Yet it always shews him angry and fretful, and one that keeps bad com∣pany. It also makes him merry and cheerful; yet he may fall in love to that degree, that he may be ready to die for his mistress; but if the nativity be by night, he shall be inconstant; it also shews in age he shall be covetous. He shall thrive in navigation, especially in the trade towards the east, for from thence his fortune shall arise. If the native be a woman, she will be modest and bashful, of a fearful disposition, and very much addicted to travel.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Aquarius,</HI> maketh the native of a friendly disposition, fearful of waters, and in danger of receiving prejudice thereby; he shall be subject to sickness and quartidian agues until about the fifteenth year of his age, after which he shall be more fortunate, for by travelling through divers countries, he shall gath∣er riches, which with a liberal hand he shall distri∣bute; he shall meet with sundry losses and afflictions, especially by means of his wife and other women; and shall live for a long time without the enjoyment of her. But she being dead, his affairs will be more fortunate. If the native be a woman, she shall be comely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> body, and of a faithful and canstant mind: she shall be en∣riched with other men's goods, but her children shall
<PB N="27" REF="030393_0026_0FE6C4624FACA260"/>
be a great affliction to her, and she shall receive much damage by them. She shall not attain to any great fortune until the two and twentieth year of her age, and then she shall arrive to a competent estate.</P>
<P>The sun being in <HI>Pisces</HI> denotes a man to be quick, of a valuable and ready tongue, bold and conceited, but fortunate in finding out hidden treasure: for this is peculiar to those who are born when the sun is in <HI>Pisces,</HI> that they shall find something unlooked for, and shall be also enriched with other men's goods; it also shews them to be merry and jocose, of a good disposition, and loving the company of good men; they seldom live very long, but if they reach to thirtyfive years they may live to a good old age. They shall never be very rich, except in their own opinions; they are al∣ways full of uneasy thoughts, and are in danger of be∣ing brought into captivity by means of women; they have commonly some mark in the elbow or foot, and their fortune will come from the mouth. If the na∣tive be a woman, she will be bold, contumelious, scold, and something worse, for she will forsake her own hus∣band, and cleave to an adulterer.</P>
<P>Thus I have given an account of the influences of the sun, being in any of the celestial signs, by which any person may know in what sign the sun was at the time of his birth.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>This Table is so easy, it needs little explanation.— Its use is to find what planet rules any hour of the day, every day in the week. As for example, I desire to know what planet rules on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock at night; under the title of Wednesday, I look for 9, which answers to 7 o'clock at night; for the natural day consists of 24 hours, beginning after midnight, so that from 12 at noon, you begin to reckon 13, 14 15, &amp;c. you find that the 19th hour from midnight, an∣swers to 7 o'clock at night, over against which you will find ☉ which shews that to be the hour of the
<PB N="31" REF="030393_0030_0FE6C468B8D51A50"/>
sun. And if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the morning that day, you will find against ♀ 7, which shews that <HI>Venus</HI> rules that hour; and so of any other hour in the day.</P>
<P>But I shall now come to speak of the significations of the planetary hours of each planet, and what it por∣tends to those that are born in them. The hour of <HI>Saturn</HI> is strong, and is good to do all things that re∣quire strength: Such as fighting or bearing burdens, or the like; but for those things it is very evil. He that is born in the hour of <HI>Saturn,</HI> is slow, dull and melancholy, of a dogged temper and disposition, black and swarthy of complexion, being quarrelsome, wrath∣ful, and very malicious.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Jupiter</HI> is in all things good, and de∣notes peace, love and concord: He that is born in the hour of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> is of a ruddy and sandy complexion, fair hair, well proportioned body, and of a lovely coun∣tenance, his face rather broad than long, well spoken and courteous, of a very affable carriage, sober, just and religious. The hour of <HI>Mars</HI> is evil, and denotes the person born in it, to be of a cholerick constitution, and of a robust strong body, soon angry, and hard to be reconciled; his face red, and his eyes sparkling and fiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready to quarrel with every man he meets, which often times brings him to an untimely end. The hour of the <HI>Sun</HI> signi∣fies great strength, and is very unfortunate for kings and princes. He that is born in that hour, hath sharp eyes, brown hair, and a round face, denotes one that is a great projector, aims at high things, but is often dis∣appointed, and seldom brings his designs to pass.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Venus</HI> is very propitious and fortunate, but is better by night than day, especially mid-day, for then the sun covers it. He that is born in this hour hath fair hair, soft eyes, a little forehead, and round beard; very complaisant in his carriage, mighty am∣orous, and a great admirer of women; much addicted
<PB N="32" REF="030393_0031_0FE6C41D8C32AA58"/>
to singing and gaming, and spends his money in court∣ing the female sex.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Mercury</HI> is very good, but chiefly from the beginning to the middle: He that is born in this hour, his situation inclining to tallness, a sharp long face, long eyes, and a long nose: His forehead narrow, long beard and thin hair, long arms and long fingers; of a good disposition, and an obliging temper, much given to reading, and very desirous of knowledge, de∣lighting to be among books; very eloquent in his speech, and yet addicted to lying; and if he be poor, he is commonly light fingered.</P>
<P>The hour or the <HI>Moon</HI> is both good and evil, ac∣cording to the day: For from the 4th to the 17th it is good to those that are born under it; but from the 17th to the 20th, it is counted unfortunate to be born under it; and from the 20th to the 27th, very unhap∣py. He that is born in the hour of the <HI>Moon,</HI> especial∣ly upon her own day, shall be pale faced, of a thin, meagre visage, with hollow eyes, and of a middle stat∣ure, he appears very courteous and obliging, but is very crafty and deceitful, setting about many things, but so inconstant and variable in his humour, that he is pres∣ently off of them again, and setting about something else; insomuch, that what he cries up in one hour, he shall as much cry down the next; he is also very ma∣licious, and will never forget an affront once offered him, his constitution phlegmatic.</P>
<P>Thus have I given the reader the judgment of the ancients upon the planetary hours, and what they portend to those that are born under them, by which a person, comparing himself with what is here set down, may easily know under what planet he was born.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Signification of the Seven Planets, with respect to Men's Bodies.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I conclude my discourse of the seven planets, their nature and influences, I shall give you an account of the signification of them, as they respect the several parts of man's body, and the diseases that they govern, that proper remedies may be applied accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Saturn</HI> governs the right ear, the bladder and the bones; and the diseases he governs, are quartian agues, concerns, black choler, rheums, coughs, palsies, loose∣ness of the blood, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI> governs the lungs, ribs, liver, seeds, arteries, and left ear; and the diseases incident to them, are pleuricies and apoplexies, and such as proceed from 100 great a quantity of blood, or from wind in any part of the body.</P>
<P><HI>Mars</HI> governs the gall, the veins and the reigns, and their distempers; which are fevers, yellow jaun∣dice, madness, choler carbuncles. <HI>Mars</HI> also governs the stones and privy members of man or woman in part.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sun</HI> governs the eyes, heart, and right side, and the diseases relating to them; such as colds, especially in the stomach and liver, fluxes in the eyes, cramp, headach, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Venus</HI> governs the liver, loins, matrix, paps and throat: The diseases whereof are weakness in the body, and members, catarrhs, French pox, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> governs the brain, thought, memory, speech and tongue, and also the distempers incident thereto, are falling sickness, madness, coughs, hoarseness, stam∣mering, phthysic, and rheums.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moon</HI> governs the left eye of a man, and the right eye of a woman, also the stomach, belly, and the
<PB N="34" REF="030393_0033_0FE6C468CCD4D210"/>
left side; and the diseases proper to them, are dropsies, palsies, rotten coughs, surfeits, worms in children, king's evil, falling sickness, convulsion fits, dimness of sight, small pox, and measles. <HI>Here note,</HI> That in all distempers, before you apply any thing to the patient, it is proper and necessary to consult the motions and positions of the planets; and when by the table of planetary hours before recited, you know what plan∣et rules; you must in the next place consider the na∣ture of that planet, as whether it be fierce or cruel, as <HI>Mars;</HI> or friendly and benevolent, as <HI>Jupiter;</HI> also whether they be cold and moist, or hot and dry, and what is the predominent complexion, whether the sanguine choler, phlegm or melancholy; as also what member of the body it governs, and what disease is under its power. These things being diligently weigh∣ed and considered, will furnish the ingenious physician with grounds sufficient to make a judgment of the true nature of the disease, whereby he may apply the suita∣ble and proper remedies that shall best consist with, and the most prevalent against the destemper; where∣as the want of a due consideration of the matter, cause the physicians oftentimes to administer those med∣icines that rather kill than cure, though these very med∣icines may be good against the same disease to a patient under other circumstances, and falling sick un∣der a different position of the signs and planets.</P>

<HEAD>THE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE: TREATING OF THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS. PART II. <HI>Containing Prognostications for ever necessary for keeping the Body in Health,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have found in the Astrological Science there are four different sort of humours in the the body of man, of which the four complexions are formed and of these one is made of yellow choler, a∣nother of black choler, a third phlegm, and a fourth of blood: And if any of these be wanting the body must perish, because they equally sustain it.</P>
<P>And all those ought to be kept in an equality, or if one be predominent over the rest, it puts the body out of order and brings diseases, which many times end in death, for the blood stagnated and gathering into clots, causeth shortness of breath, which by degrees growing less and less, at last proves without remedy; but if a person be let blood in the beginning of those disorder∣ed humours, the danger may be easily prevented. To purge the blood.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="030393_0035_0FE6C46E052419E0"/><HI>R.</HI> Of both sorts of scurvy grass, of each six hand∣fuls, of ground ivy eight handfuls, of sage six hand∣fuls, of scapwort root, four ounces. Acrimony and cresses, of each four handfuls; of rosemary flowers, two drams, of leaves of rosemary and balm, of each a handful, four orange peals, a large nutmeg sliced; put all into four gallons of new ale; and when it has done working, stop the barrel close. Take a pint every morning, and at four in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Likewise the black choler, or melancholy, is extreme∣ly dangerous, and when it gains the ascendant over the other, do great prejudice to the body several ways, causing divers distempers; and sometimes prevails so much over the senses, that a man becomes in a man∣ner a mere ideot, and also raises a kind of scurf all o∣ver the body, which sometimes turns to the measles, and are, besides, very apt to make a man afraid even of his own shadow, and turn a stout man into a coward, and a well bred person into one that is unmannerly: But by the use of proper medicines, such as herbs, flowers, and the like, all this may either be prevented or cured:—First shave the head, then bleed plentiful∣ly, afterwards purge well with the extract of Hellebore; lastly, let them use the following diet drink.</P>
<P><HI>R.</HI> Epithymum, dodder of thyme, wood sorrel, of each a handful, rosemary flowers, lavander flowers, of each two drams, primrose and cowslip roots, of each an ounce, dock root half a pound; slice the roots and infuse all in a gallon of small ale, and drink as com∣mon drink. White Phlegm is also very hurtful, if it exceed in quantity and overpower the other humours, for then they cause the gout, and divers diseases, and are also prejudicial to the feet, legs knees, hands and reins, causing evil favor both from the teeth, mouth, nose and ears; but also this may be cured by med∣icines compounded of roots and flowers; likewise by physical drinks, and taking a vomit.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030393_0036_0FE6C4B0C93D8A20"/><HI>R.</HI> Dried rosemary tops rose leaves, lavander flow∣ers, red sage and mint, of each a handful, roots succory, two ounces, senna hermoducts turbith, and seammony, of each two drams, of zedoary, ginger, cloves and cubebs, of each one dram, infuse them in three quarts of good white wine for two days; take a wine glass full three times a day.</P>
<P>Yellow Choler, is likewise very bad when it predom∣inates in the body, affecting the heart, and troubling the brain, and indeed weakening all the members of the body, causing a general faintness, with such a loss of appetite, that neither meat nor drink will go down:— Besides which, it alters a man's colour, and is hurtful to the eyesight. This also may be helped by taking a vomit, and applying proper medicines, compounded of the roots and flowers of several herbs.</P>
<P><HI>R.</HI> Of the roots of turmerick half an ounce, tods of centary the less, roman wormwood and horehound, of each an handful, roots of the greater nettle two ounces, boil them in three pints of water to the half, then add two scruples of saffron tied up in a bag, and a pint of white wine, give it a warm or two, and strain it for use; dose, a small glass full night and morning.</P>

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Of the Body of Man from the four Parts of the World.</HEAD>
<P>MUCH also may be known of the bo∣dy of man from any disposition of the four parts of the world; that is to say, east, west, north and south.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> As to the east; this signifies the disposition to be fiery and juvenile, and betokens summer. In this part the water is thin and high coloured, the gross male very hard and ruddy, and the spirit somewhat thick and glutenous. The signs in this part or quar∣ter, are <HI>Aries, Leo</HI> and <HI>Saggittarius;</HI> and the distem∣pers signified hereby, are hot, dry, and subject to a choler: If a person be taken sick in those original signs, he is in danger, and cannot be cured but by medica∣ments of a contrary nature, that is cold and moist, and his diet ought also to be of the same nature: Which advice, if he follows, he may, by God's grace and mer∣cy, be recovered.</P>
<P><HI>R.</HI> Barley water a gallon, leaves of mallows, marsh∣mallows, violets, of each a handful, roots of marsh∣mallows, half a pound, liquorish four ounces; boil all to three quarters, strain, and drink it for a common drink. Purge once a week with <HI>extrasdum rudis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the west; this signifies the disposition to be airy, brisk and adolescent, and betokens the spring.</P>
<P>In this quarter, the water is high coloured, but yet thick withal, and the gross male very thick and ruddy, the spittle beings tenuous and of a sweetish taste, and the excrementious parts disordered. The signs that govern the west are <HI>Gemini, Libra</HI> and <HI>Aquarius.</HI> Ac∣cidental distempers are such as proceed from sanguine complexions, being hot and moist; and therefore the medicines that best compose them, are cold and dry, and care must be taken that the diet of the patient be of the same kind.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the north; this signifies the disposi∣tion to be dull and earthly increasing in years, and be∣tokens autumn.</P>
<P>In this quarter the water is thin and whitish; the gross male is thick, and of taste like vinegar, the excre∣ments will tetulent. The signs that have nomination in the north, are <HI>Taurus, Virgo</HI> and <HI>Capricorn.</HI> Sen∣tentional distempers proceed from melancholy, and are cold and dry, which are best cured by medicines hot and moist, and the food that the patients eat, ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the same kind.</P>

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to the south; this signifies the disposi∣tion to be cold, watry and weak, like to old age, and betokens winter.</P>
<P>In this quarter, the water is somewhat thick, pale, and white, the gross male pale and thick, and the spittle renuous and sweet, the excrementuous matter being weak. The signs that bear rule in the south, are <HI>Can∣cer, Scorpio</HI> and <HI>Pisces.</HI> Meredian distempers proceed from phlegm, and are cold and moist, and by necessary consequence, those medicines that oppose it, must be hot and dry, and of the same nature must his diet also be, that would either prevent or cure such distempers. <HI>R.</HI> Lignum Vitae a pound, sassafrass a pound, root of master wort an ounce, angelica roots two ounces, shav∣ings of ivory, liquorish, of each four ounces, sweet fennel seed bruised half an ounce; boiled in two gal∣ons

<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> Directions for letting Blood in each of the twelve Months.</HEAD>
<P><HI>January</HI>] THIS month beware of letting blood on the 1st, 2d, 5th, 10th, 15th, 19th, 20th, and 25th days. because of these days it is very dangerous; but to drink good white wine fasting, will both clense the body, and procure an appetite, but if thou hast a de∣sire to be let blood, and necessity urge it, see that the sign be good for that purpose, or else it is better letting it alone.</P>
<P><HI>February.</HI>] I caution thee this month to beware of cutting any pottage made of ducks or mallows, for they are right perilous, and if thou hast occasion to let blood, whether it be on the wrist or arms, let it not be upon the 4th, 8th, 16th, or 18th days, unless the sign be very good, and the necessity very urgent.</P>
<P><HI>March.</HI>] In this month take care how you eat figs or raisins; also sweet meats or drinks, but eat hot meat, and if thou hast occasion to be let blood, let it be on the right arm, and upon the 5th, 11th, or 17th days, for then thou may'st do it with advantage, it being good against all sorts of fevers, but take heed of bleeding on the 1st, 15th, 16th, 19th, or 28th days, if thou canst possibly avoid it; but if thou art under a necessity, see that the sign be favorable.</P>
<P><HI>April.</HI>] In this month I would advise thee to be let blood in the left arm, and upon the 3d, 12th, or 15th days, for thereby thou shalt both prevent the headach and strengthen the eyesight all the year after.—In this month also eat fresh and hot meat; but take heed of bleeding on the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 20th days, for on those days it will be perilous.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030393_0041_0FE6C47A4FEA0D08"/><HI>May.</HI>] In this month it is good to walk abroad early in the morning, and to drink sage ale, and to eat sage and fresh butter, and other good meats and drink, but neither eat the head nor feet of any creature during this month. Letting blood may also be good for thee on the 1st, or the 8th day, on which arm thou pleaseth, as likewise on the 27th or 28th days, and thou shalt find it beneficial against all distempers; but take heed of the 2d, 6th, and 25th days, for then it will be hurtful.</P>
<P><HI>June.</HI>] It is the opinion of some physicians, that in this month it is good to drink cold waters fasting, every morning, and to be temperate in thy meat and drink, and if thou hast occasion to bleed, do it on the 28th day, and it may be beneficial; but take heed that thou bleedest not on the 7th, 10th, 16th, 18th, nor 20th, for those are dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>July.</HI>] In this month abstain from <HI>Venus,</HI> for now both the brain and humours are open, bleed not at all this month, except on very urgent necessity, and then he sure thou avoid bleeding on the 13th and 15th days, for they are perilous.</P>
<P><HI>August.</HI>] In this month forbear eating any sort of worts, or any kind of hot meats, drink of spices, and avoid bleeding on the 1st, 20th, 29th, and 30th days, on the other days, if necessity urge, thou mayest, but without an absolute necessity, it is better to let it alone.</P>
<P><HI>September.</HI>] In this month thou mayest eat fruit without danger, provided it be ripe, and not infected, out bleed not on the 4th, 16th, 21st, nor 22d, days; for then thou wilt find it prejudicial; but if thou bleedest on the 27th, or 28th days, either for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all∣ing sickness, frenzy, dropsy, or palsy, thou shalt not need to fear them that year.</P>
<P><HI>October.</HI>] In this month if you drink wine, and other wholesome liquors, it will comfort thy heart:— but bleed not unless there be great occasion, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee that the sign be good for thee: And yet let the oc∣casion

be what is will, I advise thee to forbear bleed∣ing on the 3d, 4th, and 5th days.</P>
<P><HI>November.</HI>] In this month bleed not at all, unless up∣on great necessity; for now the blood lies in the head vein, neither is it convenient for thee to bathe, but thou mayest vent thee a little of grasing; for all the humous are now apt to bleed. But if urgent necessity requires thou be let blood, yet see that thou bleedest not on the 5th, 6th, 15th, 19th, 28th, nor 29th days.</P>
<P><HI>December.</HI>] In this month bleed not at all, without it be absolutely necessary; and yet, even in such a case, be sure thou dost not on the 5th, 7th, 15th, 17th, nor 22d day; but on the 26th day, thou mayst bleed without danger. In this month also see that thou keep thy shins from the fire.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Directions for the letting of Blood, shewing where Every Vein in the Body of Man may be readily found.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE that are troubled with the me∣grims, fevers lethargy, or pains in the head, must be let blood in the vein which is in the midst of the fore∣head.</P>
<P>Those that are of a dull understanding, and are troubled with deafness and shortness of breath, also those that have the measles or leprosy, must be let blood in the arterial vein behind the ears. Those that are troubled with too much blood in the brain, which is bad for the sight, ought to be let blood in the arterial
<PB N="44" REF="030393_0043_0FE6C47A5F27C8C8"/>
veins near the temples; which is also very good against the gout, megrim, and divers other distempers of the head.</P>
<P>For imposthumes, swelling in the throat, quinsey, and other such like distempers, let a man bleed in the two veins under the tongue.</P>
<P>When the leprosy proceeds from abundance of blood it will be proper to bleed in the two original veins in the neck; but not without the advice of a physician.</P>
<P>Those that are troubled with phthysic, and short-winded, and are given to spit blood, ought to bleed in the arm, and they will find ease.</P>
<P>Bleeding at the liver vein in the arm takes away the extraordinary heat of the body, and keeping it in a good state of health, and it is very available against the yellow jaundice, and imposthumes of the liver, and against the palsy.</P>
<P>The pains that come from the stomach and side, as blains, bletches, imposthumes, and divers other acci∣dents that proceed from too much repletion of blood, are cured in letting blood in the vein between the mas∣ter finger and the little finger.</P>
<P>For the dropsy, let blood on the right side, between the womb and the branch. <HI>And here, note,</HI> the party should bleed proportionable, according to their fatness, or leanness, and this ought not to be done without the advice of a doctor.</P>
<P>For blotches and imposthumes proceeding from the groin, let blood in the vein named <HI>Sophon,</HI> which is one of the three under the ankle of the foot. It is also of great advantage to courses to descend in men, and to prevent the <HI>Hemorrhoides</HI> in the secret parts.</P>
<P>When any person is taken by the pestilence, caused by repletion of humours, let them bleed in the vein that is between the wrist of the feet, and the great toe;— but let the patient be sure to bleed within twentyfour hours after he is first seized with this distemper, and let
<PB N="45" REF="030393_0044_0FE6C4BB77D8A950"/>
it be with respect to the patient's body whether it be fat or lean.</P>
<P>If the eyes run with water, or be red, or any other ill, proceeding from the overflowing of blood and hu∣mours; let the patient bleed in two veins that are in the angle of the eyes.</P>
<P>If the nose be red and pimpled, and the face be red and pimpled in the like manner, and be troubled with red drops, scabs, pistules and other infections, that may proceed from too much blood; let the patient bleed in the vein which is at the end of the nose.</P>
<P>For the toothache, and the canker in the mouth, let the party troubled be let blood in the four veins that are in the gums in the mouth. Those that are taint∣ed with a stinking breath, let them be let blood in the vein that is between the lip and the chin.</P>
<P>There are four veins in each arm, the biggest of the four is from the head, the heart challenges the second, and the third from the liver; the last is called the low∣er liver vein, and comes from the melt. These differ∣ent veins should be bled upon different occasions: As for instance, for pains in the head, eyes, brain, heart, sweeled faces, and those that are red; it is most proper to bleed that vein in the arm which has relation to the head. For fevers, either tertains or quartans, the low∣er liver vein is the most proper to be blooded; but then care must be taken that the orifice be made wider, and not so deep as usual, lest thereby it not only gathers wind, but also damages a sinew that is underneath it, called the lizard.</P>
<P>There are three veins in each, and that above the thumb is proper to bleed, in order to remove the heat of the face, and to dissipate the thick blood, and hu∣mours that are in the head, this vein being more proper than the arm.</P>
<P>Against all fevers, tertains and quartans, phlegms, and other obstructions about the paps and the melt,
<PB N="46" REF="030393_0045_0FE6C47C8BDB1860"/>
letting blood between the little finger and the leech finger, helps very much.</P>
<P>Against pain and humours in the groin and geni∣tals, bleed a vein in the thigh.</P>
<P>Against pains in the flanks, and to dissipate all hu∣mours that would gather therein, and to restrain too great a flux in the menstrues in women, it exceeding∣ly helps to bleed the vein under the ankle of the foot, without, which is called the Sciot.</P>

<P>MANY times it happeneth, that legs, arms, and fingers are broken, or out of joint, and the parties so hurt are void of help, by reason they have no surgeon near them: Therefore, for the relief of such persons, I have here set down some directions, by which they may be eased of their pain; But I will not wish them to trust to their own skill, if they have any expert surgeon near at hand.</P>
<P>If a leg or an arm be broken, then have a care to place the member in the same manner as it were before, which you will do in this manner:</P>
<P>Take a towel, and make it fast about the place where it is broken, and then take another towel and fasten it underneath the place where it is broken, and then cause two men to pull those two towels, that they may there∣by extend or stretch out the member, and when the member is stretched forth at length, place the broken bones as they were at first, and so by little and little, let them slack their pulling; then have a cloth ready, so big that it may compass the whole member; wet this both in the white of an egg and oil of roses min∣gled together, and lay it upon the grieved part, then roll it about with a linen roller of four fingers broad,
<PB N="51" REF="030393_0050_0FE6C4C59B4B6188"/>
and two yards long; wet the roller in the water and vinegar mixed together.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Roll it about the fracture three or four times; then downward, and then upward, and fasten it; then roll it with another roller after the same manner, on these place thin splints of light wood armed with tow, one fingers breadth from each other, and bind them on with tape, then place the member on some loft pil∣low for twenty days; but if a painful itch do arise, open and foment the place with warm water, and then anoint it with <HI>Unguentum Album,</HI> and roll it up again If a finger be broken, roll it with a convenient roller, and splint it, and use the means aforesaid.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of <HI>Physiognomy,</HI> and the Judgment made therby.</HEAD>
<P>PHYSIOGNOMY is an ingenuous science of knowledge of nature, by which the inclina∣tions and dispositions of every creature are understood; and because some of the members are uncompounded, and enrire of themselves, as the tongue, the ears, &amp;c. and some of a mixed nature, the eye, the nose, and others; we therefore say, that there are many signs which agree and live together, which inform a wise man how to make his judgment, before he be too rash to deliver it to the world.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be esteemed a foolish and idle art, see∣ing it is derived from the superior bodies. For there is no part of the face of the man, but what is under the
<PB N="54" REF="030393_0053_0FE6C486A20F7798"/>
peculiar influence or government, not only of the seven planets, but also of the twelve signs of the Zodiack, and from each governing part is the nature and incli∣nation of a man or woman plainly foretold, if the per∣sons undertaking this province, or pretending to it, be an artist. Which, that my reader may attain to, I shall set these things in a clearer light by the following figure.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>By this the reader may see, at the first glance, that the forehead is governed by ♂ <HI>Mars;</HI> the right eye is under the dominion of ☉ <HI>Sol;</HI> the left eye is ruled by the ☽ <HI>Moon,</HI> or <HI>Luna;</HI> the right ear is the care of ♃ <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the left of ♄ <HI>Saturn;</HI> the ruling of the nose is claimed by ♀ <HI>Venus</HI> (which by the way is one reason that in all unlawful veneral encounters, the nose is so subject to bear the scars which are gotten in those wars) and the nimble ☿ <HI>Mercury,</HI> the significator of eloquence, claims the dominion of the mouth, and that very justly.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030393_0054_0FE6C4CE1DBC4248"/>Thus have the seven planets divided the face among them, but not with so absolute a sway, but that the twelve signs of the Zodiac come in for a part; and therefore the sign of ♋ <HI>Cancer</HI> presides in the upper∣most part of the forehead, and ♌ <HI>Leo</HI> attending upon the right eyebrow, ♐ <HI>Sagittary</HI> does upon the right eye, and ♎ <HI>Libra</HI> upo the right ear; upon the left eye and eyebrow, you will find ♒ <HI>Aquarius</HI> and ♊ <HI>Gemini</HI> and ♈ <HI>Aries</HI> taking care of the left ear; ♉ <HI>Taurus</HI> rules in the forehead, and ♑ <HI>Capricorn</HI> the chin; ♍ <HI>Scorpio</HI> takes upon him the protection of the nose; ♏ <HI>Virgo</HI> claims the precedence of the right cheek, and ♓ <HI>Pisces</HI> of the left. And thus the face of man is cantoned out among the signs and planets, which be∣ing carefully attended to, will sufficiently inform the artist how to pass a judgment. For according to the nature of the sign or planet ruling, so also is the judg∣ment to be of the part ruled; which all those that have understanding know easily how to apply.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to give a particular judgment of the several parts of the body: And <HI>first. Of the head.</HI> A large head shews a person stupid and of a dull ap∣prehension, also a very small head signifies the same; but the head of a man being neither great nor small, is the prognostic of a wise man; for all extremes are irregular, and a deviation from nature; and experience has made it manifest, that a great head and small mem∣bers, do always produce much indiscretion and folly, both in man or woman; but we must also consider the several parts of the head: And first,</P>
<P><HI>Of the Hair.</HI>] The hair is only the excresence of a moist brain; yet the ancients observe several things from it; as, if the hair be thin, it shews a man to be of a weak constitution; but if curled and thick, it shews the person to be of a hot complexion: If the hair be stiff, and stand upright, either upon the head, or any other part of the body, it shews the person extreme∣ly
<PB N="56" REF="030393_0055_0FE6C486B27EAE78"/>
subject to fear, and very apt to be frighted. If the hair be thick and lank, it shews the person to be meek and humble, and his constitution inclined to cold.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Forehead.</HI>] A large forehead shews a liberal man; but the forehead narrow, denotes a foolish per∣son: A long forehead shews one apt to learn, and a high forehead, swelling and round, is a sign of a crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of wrinkles, shews a man to be envious and crafty.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Eyes.</HI>] The eyes being moist and clear, shews mirth, good manners, and an honest life, but if the eyes be declining and looking downward, or red and very great, they betoken fleshy lust; small hallow eyes signify covetousness; grey eyes an evil man, hollow eyes a crafty man, rolling eyes a wicked and vicious man, black eyes denote a sharp and piercing wit, but one lustful and incontinent; great eyes denote sloth; trembling eyes sluggishness; glittering eyes betokens drunkenness; smilling eyes shew a merry life; eyes of divers colours,, and small, denote one crafty and flat∣tering; eyes turned towards the nose, shew a man given to women; great drooping eyes, with an unsta∣ble countenance, shew a man mad; the circle of the ball green, declares a crafty wicked man, and a thief; moist eyes denote stoutness of stomach, perfect speech gluttonous and mad; high eyes, large, clear, pure and moist, are tokens of circumspection, diligent persons, and lovers; eyes always running, without sickness cause it, shew foolishness; small and hollow eyes, the cove∣tous, deceitful, and angry man; cheerful eyes betoken just men, of pleasant disposition, kind and holy; twink∣ling eyes, shew a thief and one that lays wait to catch and ensnare men; blear eyes signify a whoremas∣ter.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Eyebrows.</HI>] Upright eyebrows are amiable, but the eyebrows hanging over, shew an effeminate person. The brows very hairy, denote an impediment
<PB N="57" REF="030393_0056_0FE6C4CE2C14D9E0"/>
in his speech, and the brows being extended to the temples, shew a man to be a sloven, and uncleanly.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Ears.</HI>] Open ears shew a man to be without reason and understanding; great ears an unwise man, and small ears a fool; square ears, and of a middle size, shew a learned and wise man.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Nose.</HI>] A great nose shews a good man; a little nose a deceitful person. A sharp nose denotes an angry person, and a scold; thick and low, a person of bad manners. The nose stretching to the mouth, de∣notes honesty, strength, and aptness to learning. A nose like an ape, betokens a libidinous and riotous person; a long crooked nose, magnanimity and gener∣osity.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Mouth.</HI>] A very big mouth, with the upper lip hanging over, signifies a man foolish and unsteady, also a rash man, a babbler, a glutton, and an ungodly man. An indifferent large mouth, sheweth a bold and courageous man, a warrior.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Lips.</HI>] Thin lips with a little mouth, shews an effeminate person. Slender, thin and fine lips, be∣tokens eloquence; fleshy and great lips, a fool; and those whose teeth bear up their lips, are generally con∣tumelious, slanderers, unfaithful, also addicted to the love of women.</P>
<P><HI>Of the face.</HI>] A lean face is a token of a wise man; the face plain and flat, denotes a man of strife: The face without any rising or swelling, denotes a person injurious and unclean; a fleshy face shews a man apt to learn; a sad face sometimes denotes foolishness, and sometimes wisdom. A fat face shews a man to be a liar, and foolish; a round face signifies folly; a great face shews a man dull and slow about business; a well proportioned face shews a person to have virtuous qual∣ities, and to live a commendable life, whether they be rich or poor.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="030393_0057_0FE6C48F9C6C8510"/><HI>Of the Voice.</HI>] A shrill voice denotes a person to be choleric and hasty. A great and hoarse voice shews a person to be injurious, and of a merciless temper. A weak and low voice shews a man to be fearful and cow∣ardly.

A thick neck denotes a rude, barbarous, ill natured man. A long slender neck shews a man to be a coward. A thick and long neck, a furious and stubborn person. A mean neck, a strong and virtuous man, and one inclined to learning.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Breast.</HI>] A broad breast is always good, and presents magnanimity, boldness, honesty and courage. A narrow breast denotes imbecility, or weakness, both of body and mind. A pursy or gross breast, shews a man to be moross, cross and void of pity. The pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or dugs hanging down from the breast, shews a violent choleric man.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Back.</HI>] A broad back is a sign of strength; but the mean proportion of both back and breast is always commendable. A crooked or hunch back, is generally a token of a nigardly and covetous person.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Of <HI>Palmestry,</HI> shewing the various Judgments drawn from the Hand.</HEAD>
<P>ISAALL next say something of Palmes∣try, which is a judgment made of the conditions incli∣nations, and fortunes of men and women, from the various lines and characters which nature has imprint∣ed in the hand, which are almost as various as the hands that have them. And to render what I shall say more plain, I will in the first place present the scheme or fig∣ure of a hand, and explain the various lines therein.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>By this figure the reader will see that one of the lines, and which indeed is reckoned the principal, is called the line of life; this line incloses the thumb, separating it from the hollow of the hand. The next to it, which is called the natural line, takes its beginning from the
<PB N="60" REF="030393_0059_0FE6C48FAC0E4A30"/>
rising of the fore finger, near the line of life, and reach∣es to the table line, and generally makes a triangle, thus △. The table line, commonly called the line of fortune, begins under the little finger, and ends near the middle finger. The girdle of <HI>Venus,</HI> which in another line so called, begins near the joint of the little finger, and ends between the fore finger and the middle finger.</P>
<P>The line of death is that which plainly appears in a counter line to that of life, and by some is called the sister line, ending usually at the other end; for when the line of life is ending, death comes, and it can go no farther. There are also lines in the fleshy parts as in the ball of the thumb, which is called the mount of <HI>Venus;</HI> under each of the fingers are called mounts, which are each one governed by a several planet, and the hollow of the hand is called the plain of <HI>Mars.</HI> I now proceed to give judgment of these several lines. And in the first place take notice, that in Palmestry the left hand is chiefly to be regarded; because therein the lines are most visible, and have the strictest com∣munication with the heart and brains. Now having promised these, in the next place observe the line of life, and if it be fair, extended to its full length, and not broken with an intermixture of cross lines, it shews long life and health; and it is the same if a double line of life appears, as there sometimes does. When the <HI>Stars</HI> appear in this line, it is a significator of great lossess and calamities: if on it there be the figure of two O's, or a Y, it threatens the person with blindness. If it wraps itself about the table line, then does it promise wealth and honor to be attained by prudence and industry; if the line be cut or rugged at the upper end, it denotes much sickness. If this line be cut by any line coming from the mount of <HI>Venus,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declares the person to be unfortunate in love, and business also, and threatens him with sudden death. A cross be∣tween
<PB N="61" REF="030393_0060_0FE6C4CF502F2488"/>
the line of life and the table line, shews the person to be very liberal and charitable, and of a noble spirit. Let us now see the signification of the table line.</P>
<P>The table line, when broad, and of a lovely colour, shews a healthful constitution, and a quiet and con∣tented mind, and courageous spirit: But if it have crosses towards the little finger, it threatens the party with much affliction by sickness. If the line be dou∣ble, or divided in three parts in any of the extremi∣ties, it shews the party to be of a generous temper, and of a good fortune to support it; but if this line be forked at the end, it threatens the person shall suffer by jealousies, fears, and doubts, and with the loss of riches got by deceit. If three points such as these ... are found in it, they denote the person prudent and liberal, a lover of learning, and of a good temper. If it spreads itself towards the fore and middle fingers, and ends blunt, it denotes preferment. Let us now see what is signified by</P>
<P><HI>The middle Finger.</HI>] The line has in it sometimes (for there is scarce one hand in which it varies not) divers significant characters. Many small lines between this and the table line threatens the party with sick∣ness, and also gives him hopes of recovery. A half cross branching into this line, declares the person shall have honor, riches, and good success in all his under∣takings. A half moon denotes cold and watery dis∣tempers, but a sun or star upon this line promiseth pros∣perity and riches. This line doubled in a woman shews she will have several husbands, but without any children by them.</P>
<P>The line of <HI>Venus,</HI> if it happens to be cut or divid∣ed near the fore finger, threatens ruin to the party, and that it shall befal him by means of a lascivious woman, and bad company. Two crosses upon this line, one being on the forefinger, and the other bend∣ing
<PB N="62" REF="030393_0061_0FE6C490C7503528"/>
towards the little finger, shews the party to be weak, and inclined to modesty and virtue; and indeed, it gen∣erally denotes modesty in women; and therefore those who desire such wives, usually choose them by this standard.</P>
<P>The liver line, if it be strait and crossed by other lines, shews the person to be of a sound judgment, and a piercing understanding; but if it be winding crooked, and bending outward, it shews deceit and flattery, and that the person is not to be trusted. If it makes a tri∣angle △, or a quadrangle □, it shews the person to be of a noble descent, and ambitious of honour and pro∣motion.</P>
<P>If it happens that this line and the middle line be∣gin near each other, it denotes a person to be weak in his judgment, but if a woman, danger by hard labor.</P>
<P>The plain of <HI>Mars</HI> being in the hollow of the hand, or if the line passes through it, which renders it very plain, is fortune: This plain being hollowed, and the lines be crooked and distorted, threaten the party to fall by his ill conduct. When the lines begin at the wrist, long within the plain, reaching the brawn of the hand, they shew the person to be one given to quarreling, often in broils, and of a hot and fiery spirit, by which he shall suffer much damage. If deep large crosses in the middle of the plain, it shews the party shall obtain honor by martial exploits; but if it be a woman, that she shall have several husbands, and easy labour with her children.</P>
<P>The line of death is fatal, when any crosses or broken lines appear in it; for they threaten the person with sickness and a short life. A clouded moon appearing therein, threatens a child bed woman with death. A bloody spot in the line, denotes a violent death. A star like a comet threatens ruin by war, and death by pes∣tilence; but if a bright sun appear therein, it promises long life and prosperity.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="030393_0062_0FE6C4D81949A9D0"/>As for the lines in the wrist being fair, they denote good fortune; but if crossed and broken, the contrary.</P>
<P>Thus much with respect to the several lines in the hand. Now as to the judgment to be made from the hand itself: If the hand be soft and long, and lean withal, it denotes the person of a good understanding, a lover of peace and honesty, discreet, serviceable, a good neighbour, and a lover of learning. He whose hands are very thick and very short, is thereby signifi∣ed to be faithful, strong and laborious, and one that cannot long retain his anger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ He whose hands are full of hairs, and those hairs thick; and great ones, and his fingers withal crooked, he is thereby noted to be lux∣urious, vain, false, of a dull understanding and dispo∣sition, and more foolish than wise. He whose hands and fingers do bend upwards, is commonly a liberal man, serviceable, a keeper of secrecy, and apt (to be poor for he is seldom fortunate) to do any man cour∣tesy. He whose hand is stiff and will not bend at the upper joint near his finger, is always a wretched miser∣able person, covetous, obstinate, incredulous, and one that will believe nothing that contradicts his own pri∣vate interest. And thus much shall suffice to be said of judgment made by Palmestry.</P>

<HEAD>V. <HI>Pleasant</HI> Questions <HI>in</HI> Arithmetick.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A THIEF breaking into an orchard, stole a certain number of pears, and at his coming out he met three men, one after another, who threaten∣ed to accuse him of theft, and for to appease them he gave unto the first man half the pears that he had stole, who returned him back 12 of them; then he gave un∣to the second half of the pears he had remaining, who returned him back 7; and upon the third man he gave half his residue, who returned him back 4; and in the end he had still remaining 36 pears. Now I do demand how many pears he stole in all? To answer this question you must work backwards; for if you take 4 from 20 there will remain 16, which being doub∣led
<PB N="67" REF="030393_0066_0FE64B6E05706908"/>
makes 32, from which abate 7, and there will re∣main 25, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being doubled makes 50, from which subtract 12, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here will remain 38, which again be∣ing doubled, makes 76, the true number he gathered.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the party that thinketh double the number that he thought, which done, bid him multiply the sum of them both by 5, and give you the product, which they will never refuse to do (it being so far a¦bove the number thought) from which if you abate the last figure of the product (which will always be a cypher of 5) the number thought will remain.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> Let the number thought be 53, which doubled makes 106, and multiply by 5, makes 530; then if you take away the cypher which is the last place, there will 53, the number thought.</P>
<P N="3">3. A certain man having three daughters, to the eldest he gave 21 apples, to the second he gave 16 ap∣ples, and to the third he gave ten apples, and sent them to market to sell them, and gave them command to sell one as many a penny as the other (namely seven a penny) and every one to bring home so much money as the other, and neither change apples nor money's one with another. How could that be?</P>
<P>This to some may seem impossible, but to the arith∣meticians very easy. For whereas the eldest had three pence worth and one apple over, the second two pence worth and two apples over, and the youngest had one penny's worth and three apples over; so that the youngest had so many single apples and one penny's worth, as the eldest had penny worths and one apple over. So consequently to the second proportionable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them both. They made their market thus, —a steward coming to buy fruit for his lady, bought all the apples they had at seven a penny, leaving the odd ones behind; then had the eldest sister three pence and one apple, the middle sister two pence and two apples, and the youngest one penny and three apples. The
<PB N="68" REF="030393_0067_0FE6C499D2AAB3A8"/>
steward brought the fruit to his lady, she liked it so well that she sent him for the rest, who replied there were but a few remaining.</P>
<P>She, notwithstanding, sent him for them at any rate. The steward coming to the market again, could not buy the odd apples under a penny a piece, he was fain to give it, then had the youngest sister three pence worth, the middle sister two pence worth, and the eld∣est one-penny's worth, and so they had all four pence a piece, and yet sold as many for a penny one as an∣other, and neither changed apples nor monies one with another, as they were commanded.</P>
<P N="4">4. A man bought 120 eggs at three a penny, having 120 to the hundred, also he bought 100 more at two a penny, having likewise 120 to his hundred; these eggs being mingled, he sold them 5 for two pence, and 120 to the hundred as he bought them: The question is, whether he gained or lost in the bargain?</P>
<P>If you work by the rule of three direct, you shall find that his 120 eggs, at three for a penny, came to three shillings and four pence, and his 120, at two for a penny, came to five shillings, which being added, makes eight shillings and four pence. Then again, to see what they come to at five for two pence, work likewise by the rule of three direct, and you shall find that 240 at 5 for two pence, comes to but eight shil∣lings, whereby the seller loseth four pence of the money that they first cost him.</P>

<P>A YEAR is the principal part of time, by which not only the ages of man and other things, but also the times of many actions in the world, their beginning, progress, continuance and intervals are measured: and is a periodical revolution of a great circle of months and days, in which the four seasons of <HI>Spring, Summer, Autumn</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> are, after one rev∣olution of the sun, ordained to return to their courses.</P>
<P>But there are divers sorts of years, as say the ancients, according to divers nations, which are different from one another, reduced to the rule of celestial motions. The year is divided in astronomical and political parts.</P>
<P>The astronomical year is two fold, that is <HI>Solar</HI> and <HI>Lunar.</HI></P>
<P>The solar year is the time in which the sun, by his proper motion, departing from one point of the eclip∣tic,
<PB N="70" REF="030393_0069_0FE6C49B14731798"/>
returns to the same again. And there is called either natural or syderical.</P>
<P N="1">1. The natural or tropical year, is the space of time in which the sun is departing out of the tropical, equi∣noctial, or solstitial point, and returning through the ecliptic, returneth to the same again.</P>
<P>This natural, or tropical year, contains 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds.</P>
<P>The true and unequal tropical year, is sometimes more, and sometimes less than the equal, by 6 or 7 min∣utes; so it increaseth, or decreaseth, according to the swift or slow progress of the equinoctial or solstitial points.</P>
<P N="2">2. The syderial year is the space of time in which the sun returns to the same star, from whence he de∣parted; and is 365 days, 6 hours, 6 minutes, but in the seconds there is a difference among authors.</P>
<P>Now the lunar year is likewise two fold; the com∣mon, which is 12 moons, or 354 days, 8 hours, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The embillismal, which is 13 moons or lunations, containing 383 days, 21 hours, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The political and civil years, are such as are com∣monly used for the distinction of times, wherein respect had either to the motion of the sun or moon only, or to them both together, according to the custom of di∣vers nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Julian</HI> or old <HI>Roman</HI> year, consisted of 365 days and 6 hours; this <HI>Julian</HI> account, or year, is used by the <HI>English, Muscovites, Syrians, Abassenees</HI> and <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> though the names of the months differ. It is held to begin (with the vulgar) on the 1st of Jan∣uary, which is therefore called New Year's Day; but according to the state accounts, the year begins not till the year; as for example: The first day of Janu∣ary next will be reckoned the first day of the year 1797. But because the state first account begins not till the 25th of March they commonly write the date double, thus 1719—20 from the 1st of January till the 25th of March, after which they write only 1720.</P>
<P>The Gregorian, or new Roman year, is so called, because mended by <HI>Pope Gregory</HI> XIII. consists of 365 days, 5 hours, 40 minutes and 12 seconds▪ It begins
<PB N="71" REF="030393_0070_0FE6C4D94A653D58"/>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of Months.</HEAD>
<P>THE months by which we measure the year, are of two sorts, viz. astronomical, and political, and each hath several divisions; astronomical or nat∣ural, are according to the motion of the sun and moon; and be either Solar or Lunar; the Solar are the space of time in which the sun runs through a twelfth part of the Zodiac, of which there are two sorts, mean or e∣qual, true or unequal; an equal solar month, is the time in which the sun by his mean motion, goeth a twelfth part of the Zodiac, and is always 30 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, 6 seconds, &amp;c. But the true or apparent, is according to the true motion of the sun through the Zodiac; for when he is in, or near his apogaeon, the months are longer, but when he is in, or near his perigaeon, they are shorter. Lunar months are referred to the moon's motion, and are chiefly three fold, viz.—First, periodical, which is the space of time in which the moon, by her motion, goes through the Zodiac, and is about 27 days, 8 hours; secondly, synodical, which is the space of time from one con∣junction to another, being performed according to the moon's mean motion, in 29 days, 22 hours, 44 minutes, and about 4 seconds: But according to the moon's true motion, it is sometimes greater or lesser, by about 12 hours.—Thirdly, the month of illumination, or ap∣parition, is said to be 28 days, or four weeks, it being the longest time that the moon is to be seen between the change and change: Lastly, the political months are evil and usual: As every nation best please; which differ both in proportion and name.</P>

An artificial day is from sunrising to sunsetting: differs in length of sequal hours, according to the sun's place in the Zodiac, and latitude of the region; but in unequal hours (called planetary hours) are 22, so that one hour is the 12th part of the day, be it long or short, and the hours that make an artificial, are from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to 6; that is, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XVI.</HI> The experienced Husbandman; shewing how to Manure, Plough, Sow and Weed, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>THE first point of husbandy is, to pre∣pare the ground; the second to plough it well; the third to dung it well. The ways of doing this are di∣vers, according to the nature of every soil and country. Only take notice, that all great fields are tilled with the plough and shear, but the lesser with the spade.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="030393_0079_0FE6C4AF9506C448"/>The season of the year, and the weather also, is to be observed in the ploughing of the ground; you must not plough in wet ground; nor yet after very little rain, that is, if after a great drought, a little rain falls which hath not gone deep, but only wet the upper part, for the ground ought to be thoroughly mellowed, but not too wet, for if it be too wet, you can expect but ilttle benefit that year; you must therefore observe that the season be neither too dry, nor too wet, for much dryness will hinder it from working well, be∣cause either the hardness of the earth will resist the plough, or if it should enter, yet it never will break the clods small enough, which will be hurtful to the next ploughing, but if your first ploughing has been in a dry season, it will be necessary to have some moist∣ure in your second stiring, which will also make your labor the more. When the ground is rich and wet withal, it is to be stired, when the weeds are full grown, and have their seeds in the top, which being ploughed so thick, that you can see where the coulter hath gone, utterly kills<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and destroys them; besides through many stirrings, your fallow is brought to so fine mould, that it will need very little harrowing when you sow it; and seeing so much depends upon the well ploughing of the ground, the husbandman must try whether his ground be well ploughed or not, or other∣wise, the stalks being covered with the mould, he may be easily deceived; to be certain, therefore, let him thrust down a rod in the sorrow, and if it pierce alike in every place, 'tis a sign the ground is well ploughed, but if it be shallow in one place, and deep in another, the ploughing is faulty. If you are to plough upon a hill, you must not plough up and down, but thwart, for so the inconvenient steepness is to be avoided, and the labor of men and cattle made more easy, but then you must be careful not to plough always one way, but sometimes higher, and some times lower, working as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope as you see needful.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="030393_0080_0FE6C4E0E23B0FC0"/>As to the season of ploughing, it must be chiefly in the spring, the ground being in the summer too hard, and in the winter too dirty; but in the spring, the ground being mellowed, is the more easy to be wrought upon; and the weeds are then turned in, and being plucked up by the roots before they are seeded, will not spring again, but help to enrich the ground, And therefore the middle of March is usually the best time to begin ploughing. But yet if the ground be light and sandy, it may be ploughed in the winter, if the weath∣er will permit. A slender and level ground, subject to water, should be ploughed in the end of Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and stirred again in September, and prepared for sowing a∣bout the middle of March. The light hilly ground is broke up about the middle of September, for if it be broken up before, it may be burnt up by the sun, and have no goodness remaining in it, being barren and without juice. But this shall suffice to be spoken of breaking up the ground.</P>
<P>Now if your ground be barren and cold, producing store of weeds or rushes, or to bring it to a moderate heat, and so make fruitful, let it be manured with lime. The limestones may be had among quarries of stones, and in divers other places, and you may burn them in a kiln, in the most convenient place you have to save the carriage; and when you have sanded your ground and hacked it, make your lime small, and on every a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re bestow thirty or forty bushels of lime, spreading it, and mixing it well with earth and sand; and the strong∣er and sharper the lime is, the better the earth will be, and you will find your improvement answer your labor. <HI>And here note,</HI> that it is no matter what color your lime stones are, whether white or grey, so that they be but sharp and strong in quality to give a good tincture to the earth, it being the strength and goodness of the lime, and not its beauty, that produces the profit. It is a greater help to a cold, clayey wet ground; such grounds are also very much helped by laying dung, or
<PB N="82" REF="030393_0081_0FE6C523860BB2F0"/>
any soil that is fattening, either of cattle, or such as is cast out of pond lakes, or muddy ditches, for bar∣ren and hot earth can never be overlaid with good ma∣nure and compost, for that warms the earth, and it is the want of warmth makes it unfruitful.</P>
<P>As for the hacking and sanding before mentioned, the first is, after the ground has been turned up with the plough, to go over it with a long hoe, or hack, and cut in pieces the grass which you see turned up with ridges or furrows, or any uneven lumps, that it may be dragged away, burnt, or carried together with the weeds, not to grow up again, to incumber the corn. And landing it, to bring loads of sand, and lay them in convenient places, spreading them lightly, or thick (as you see occasion) over the ground, that the lime mixing with it, may the better embody with the mould, and produce a good crop.</P>
<P>But beside what I have already mentioned, there are several other ways of manuring land: I will mention some of them, for the husbandman's better informa∣tion. But here it will not be amiss to take notice, that what will do very well for one sort of land, will not do at all for another; and therefore in manuring of land, regard must be had to the nature of it: As for example; for a clayey ground, lime and sand is ex∣cellent to manure it with, but for a barren sandy ground, good marle is much more proper. If it be asked, <HI>What this marle is?</HI> I answer, it is a rich cliff clay, an enemy to all weeds that spring up of them∣selves, and gives a generative virtue to all seeds that are sown in the ground. It is of a glewy substance, in quality cold and dry, and was earth before ti was marle, it is nothing but a rich clay of divers colours, according to the strength of the sun and climate where it is produced. This is so good a manure, that well laid on, it will enrich the barrenest ground for ten years, and some for thirty. To find it, take an auger whimble, made to hold many bits, one longer than an∣other,
<PB N="83" REF="030393_0082_0FE6C5110AA78A00"/>
till you have tried, by drawing the earth into one place, then proceed in the most proper places till you come to the marle, and the properest places are in the lowest parts of high countries, near the brooks and lakes, and in the high parts of low countries, upon the knolls or little hills, and in the clefts of steep banks, or branches in hills opening themselves; in some pla∣ces it lies deep, in others shallow; and commonly barrenly sandy grounds are verged with it, lying very deep. Having found it, dig it up in great lumps, and lay it in heaps a yard distance one from another, and when it is dried, spread all the heaps.—Many mix the marle with the sand; but because this is not so easy to come at, I will speak of others more general, that will enrich any poor sand or city for grain, with less trouble and cost than before.</P>
<P>Woolen rags are very profitable for manuring and enriching of land, a sackful and half being sufficient for dressing an acre of arable ground. The way of using them is to chop them very small, and spread them an equal thickness over the land before the fol∣lowing time, and then coming to fallow, let the plough take them carefully into the ground, and cover them.</P>
<P>Shavings, or waste horns, or hoofs of beasts, are very good to manure land withal; scatter the shavings in the same manner, and plough them in after heat. These will keep the ground in like quality as the rags, for five years together, without any renewing. The hoofs of cattle are approved of for this, and may be had of trotter and tripe men, &amp;c. and must be used as the rags and shavings. Soap ashes, when the lye has been drained from them, is of excellent use in this case, and has besides the property of killing weeds and insects that breed in the ground, and eat up the corn. The hair of beasts enriches land, being strewed and plough∣ed in, and there let it lie to rot. Also malt dust is much available to this purpose, allowing three quarts of it to an acre. And to enrich your dung or laystall, is to
<PB N="84" REF="030393_0083_0FE64B738E6420B8"/>
throw often beef broth, and other waste broths upon it, as also soap suds; and in so doing one load will be worth three of the same kind that is not so used. But this shall suffice as to manuring of ground.</P>
<P>In sowing of your seed, let your grain be the best, and scatter it according to the art of good husbandry, and let your sprinkling be a medium, not too much, nor too little. But to make the seed prosper the bet∣ter, steep it in thick slimy water, that drains from dunghills, and if no such is to be had near at hand, steep cow dung in water, and soak the seed in it; wheat will be well soaked in 18 hours; barley in 36; peas in 12; but rye and oats may be sowed dry, for that agrees best with them.</P>
<P>But when the seed is sown, all is not done; you must take care to prevent the designs of those that will make void all your labour, and defeat your hopes, or else, though you have sown your corn, you shall never see it come up; rooks, crows and daws, are great devourers of grain, who will be sure to be about you when you go to sow; to keep these at a distance, shoot some of them, and hang them upon poles in divers angles of your field; stick their feathers along the ridges of the land; lay trains of gunpowder and blow the powder up, or let it lie scattered in the most frequented places, and the scent of it will make them forsake the field, especially now and then shooting a little; you may also take great numbers of them by placing strong thick brown paper, twisted taper wise, like those on sugar loaves, in holes of the earth, the broad top coming even with the ground, bird lime the inside, and scatter some grain in it, and then the fowl putting in his head to take it out, the paper so limed will stick close, and rise with him, when being blindfolded, in amaze he will fly up a great height, and will fall down again, so that if you be near at hand, he may easily be taken. Also the scattering <HI>nux vomica,</HI> mingled with paste, if taken by them (as seldom misses) will, make them so
<PB N="85" REF="030393_0084_0FE6C51118F03F30"/>
sick that they will forsake the field. If you lime your corn they will forsake it; and so they will, if it be steeped in water wherein wormwood has been boiled, or infused; or else sprinkling your corn with the dregs of bitter oil, and it will do the like, making them cast it up sick, and not desirous of any more: And these with hanging bunches of feathers on lines or sticks, that the wind may dangle and twirl them about, may help to preserve your corn when newly sown; and this last also may be used when it is ripe. But these di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ections relate only to fowl, who, notwithstanding all you can do, will be sure to come in for a share with you.</P>
<P>But there are other destroyers of your corn besides birds, which you must likewise take care to destroy; among which are the pismires or ants, who will do a great deal of mischief by biting off the chits or sprouts, so that it will never grow, but rot in the ground: To prevent this, search in the cornfields well, especially un∣der the hedges, and the roots of old hollow trees, or on the tops of hills cast up; and if you find them there, put your limed water strong and hot among them, pre∣sently after sunsetting, and it will destroy them. For want of lime make a lye of wood ashes and it will do the same, though not so effectually.</P>
<P>Another devourer of corn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e your droves of great black beetles, which lie under the clods, and in sprout∣ing time do much mischief. To destroy these make smokes in the field, in a still night or when there is a little breathing wind that may carry it over the sur∣face of the ground, with wet rubbish or mouldy peas straw, hay, or such like, and it will kill them, or chase them out of the ground; for they are of all other crea∣tures, the greatest enemies to smoke, and can least en∣dure it. But if your ground be limed, or if you sow lime among your corn, you may trouble yourself with them no farther, for if they bite where the lime has touched, it kills them.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030393_0085_0FE64B775C6BB220"/>The next vermin to be destroyed is field rats and mice, and water rats also, for these destroy a great deal of grain, which to prevent, and ruin them, find out their round holes when the field is bare, and put hemlock seed into them, which they will eat, and it will kill them, the sprinkling of juice of hellebore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, will also do the like: But that which I prefer above the rest is, to beat common grass very small, mix it with a little copperas, vitriol, and coarse honey, and make it up in pellets, and scatter it in their haunts, in the mouth of their holes, or other like places, and the scent will draw them from all parts, and once eating it, they will certainly die. This also may be used in granaries and barns, for other rats and mice, with good success.</P>
<P>Slugs and snails are another sort of devourers, which do much mischief to corn and peas just sprouting up; to kill these, the best thing is foot or lime, sprinkled thin over the ground, for touching it they will die.</P>
<P>Grasshoppers also do much injury, by feeding on the leaf and blossom of corn and pulse, from the first to the last: These are not easily destroye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the best way to get rid of them, is, by sprinkling corn with water wherein wormwood, rue, or centaury has boiled, till the strength of them are taken away by the water; and if they bite where the sprinkling happen, they will die. The scent of any bitter thing being so offensive to them, that they are never found where any such things grow.</P>
<P>Moles are another vermin to be destroyed, for they are in a double regard destructive to corn; that is, in eating the roots, and rooting it up; not making dis∣tinction of any sort, and tasting all alike; there are divers ways of taking them, but not so easily when the corn is well grown, for then they do the greatest mischief, when their tracts, or casting up their hills, cannot be discovered so easily; however, you must do as well as you can; and when you see them casting, or moving in their tracks, strike them with an iron of
<PB N="87" REF="030393_0086_0FE6C513867D3970"/>
many spears; or dig pits in their track, and set earthen glazed pots, which they will blindly fall into, and can∣not scramble out; or fill an earthen jug with pitch, rosin and brimstone, with some loose tow or rag, and firing it, clap the neck to the mouth of the hole, and the air in the earth drawing in the scent to a great dis∣tance, will stifle them; or mix juice of hellebore with rye meal, scatter little bits in the furrows, and finding it in their way, they will greedily eat it, and die.</P>
<P>Having shewed you how to destroy such vermin as are devourers of corn, it will now be necessary to say something about weeding your corn when it is sprung up; for weeds are very offensive and destructive to corn, hindering its growth, and choaking it up.</P>
<P>When the corn is sprung up about a foot above the ground, those sorts of soil that are apt to produce weeds, will require your looking after to root them out: If they be thistles, or such as are great and offensive, they must be taken away with hooks and nippers, cutting them off close by the roots, or rather pulling them up by the roots, if you can do it without breaking the ground, so as to bring corn along with them. The nipper may be made with two long pieces of wood ri∣vetted, to be opened like a pair of pincers, with saw-teeth, closing in one another, that they may take the surer and firmer hold without slipping. And these weeds may be much hindered in their growth, by sow∣ing two bushels of bay salt in an acre of land, as you do your wheat; for though is is a friend to corn, in making it prosper and increase, yet it is an enemy to the weeds, and hinders their growth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> How to turn barren Lands into good Pasture and Meadows.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO I have been speaking of the ordering of corn, I come now to speak of enrich∣ing the earth for meadow and pasturage. And this is two ways, viz. by watering and manuring it. And for this use, the lower the ground lies (so it be not subject to overflowings, or too much wet) the better it is, and the sooner made good. Consider in the next place, what kind of grass it naturally produces, whether clear and entire, or mix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with that of worse growth, the first is best; but if it be of a worse sort, intermixed with thistles, broom and offensive weeds, then grub and pluck them by the roots, clearing the ground of them as well as you can, then dry them, mix them with straw, and burn them upon the swarth of the ground, and spread the ashes upon it, then fold your sheep upon the ground for severel nights, that their dung may increase its strength, and their feet trample up the grass; then scatter it well over with hay seeds, and go over them with a roller, or beat them with a flat shovel, that they may be pressed into the ground to take root; then over these scatter hay, or the rooting of hay under stacks, or the sweeping of the barns, or moist bottoms of any hay that has been good, and is moist, and of no other use, then spread on your manure, as horse dung, man's odure, or the dung of any beast, which being thinned, and the clods well broken, let it lie till the new grass spring through it; but do not graze it the first year, lest the cattle tread it up, not having yet taken very good root, but mow it that it may have time to come to perfection; and though the first year it may prove short and coarse, yet the second it will be fine and very long, and in great plenty. And dressing it thus but once in twenty years, will continue it for good meadow or pasture; especially if in dry seasons you have water to relieve it, which may be done by bringing springs

through it, or gathering the violent fallings of rain into a ditch on the other side of it, or by any other con∣veyance, according to the situation of the ground; on the ascending part, to overflow it so long that it soak deeper than the roots of the grass, to continue its moisture for the nourishment of it for a considerable time. <HI>And here note,</HI> that the best season for watering of meadows, is from the beginning of November to the end of April, and the muddier or more troubled the water is, the better, for then it brings a soil upon the ground; and this generally happens after hasty showers, and great fluxes of rain. And if you have many fields lying together, especially in a descent, you may make a conveniency in the uppermost, to pen up the water till it is very well soaked; and then by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uice, or breaking down of a dam, let it into the next; and so, by a small addition of water, transmit it to many.</P>
