<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARL OF BUTE, FIRST LORD OF HIS MAJESTY'S TREASURY, KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER may be the execu∣tion of the little performance which I have the honour to present to your lordship, it will derive some merit, I am persuaded, in your lordship's sight, from the good meaning wherewith it was writ∣ten, from its suitableness to my profession, and from the importance of its subject. Perhaps too, its author's undissembled re∣spect for your lordship may give it some additional value; for true respect, we are assured, can give value to the smallest of∣ferings from the hands of the poorest.</P>
<P>But, indeed, I did not know to whom I could, with greater propriety, inscribe a work of this nature, than to a nobleman, whose regular life, and punctual discharge of all the social duties must render <HI>Reflec∣tions
<PB N="iv" REF="030356_0003_0FE5CE990B34D1F8"/>
on Death</HI> not unpleasing; whose regard to works of literature hath always been emi∣nent and consistent; and who, though con∣tinually employed in affairs of the highest moment, hath testified that regard by the most favorable attention to men of science and learning.</P>
<P>From hence, my lord, we are encourag∣ed to promise the fairest days to good let∣ters and good manners:—They can∣not but flourish under your discerning eye, and the fostering patronage of our belov∣ed MONARCH; in whose unsullied virtues, while his people felicitate themselves, no grateful man can be insensible of the ho∣nour, which redounds to the illustrious per∣son, who had so considerable a share in forming the royal mind to virtue; and in∣spiring it with those great, just, and patriot sentiments, which have obtained to our so∣vereign, from his subjects, that most honor∣able of all appellations,—the Good.</P>
<P>Happy in your PRINCE'S favour, my lord, and happy in the consciousness of your own integrity, you will go on to de∣serve and to obtain the esteem and affec∣tion of all men of science, of virtue, and religion. So will your name be placed high in that temple of true glory, where
<PB N="v" REF="030356_0004_0FE5CE0F43F9A788"/>
the whispers of malevolence, and the clamours of faction, shall never be heard: where envy, the unfailing shadow of merit, shall never be permitted to enter: and where—when that melancholy hour is come, which no might nor greatness in mortality can delay—that hour in which you, my lord, shall be lost to your friends, to your country, to your king, your mo∣nument shall proclaim the glorious truth, that <Q>You were a principal instrument in putting an end to a war, uncommonly wide and extensive; and of restoring peace to an exhausted and depopulated world.</Q></P>

<P>THESE Reflections were first written with a design to be published in a small volume proper to be given away by well-disposed persons at fu∣nerals, or on any other solemn occa∣sion. But the editors of the Christian's Magazine, supposing they might be of some service to that useful and well-esteemed work, requested the author first to print them there, and afterward to pursue his original de∣sign. Accordingly, they were printed in separate chapters, and he hath reason to be satisfied with the recep∣tion they met with. His best pray∣ers accompany them in their present form, that they may be found useful to mankind.</P>

<L>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</L>
<L>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</L>

<L>That makes calamity of so long life:</L>
<L>For who would bear the whips and scorns of times,</L>
<L>Th' oppressor's wrongs. the proud man's contumely,</L>
<L>The pangs of despis'd love. the law's delay,</L>
<L>The insolence of office, and the spurns</L>

<P>A FEW evenings ago, I was called to perform the last sad office to the sacred

remains of a departed friend and neigh∣bour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ministers who are often called to attend the dying beds and funerals of the young and old▪ the rich and poor, professors and profane, are best calculated, or at least best furnished with materials, to enforce on all, the necessity of reflecting on <HI>death,</HI> and preparing for it.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is too commonly found, that a fami∣liarity with death, and a frequent recur∣rence of <HI>funerals, graves, and church-yards,</HI> serve to harden rather than humanize the mind; and to deaden rather than excite those becoming reflections, which such objects seem excellently calculated to produce. Hence the physician enters, without the least emotion, the gloomy chambers of expiring life: the undertaker handles without concern the clay-cold limbs: and the sexton whistles unappalled, while his spade casts forth from the earth the mingled bones and dust of his fel∣low-creatures.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>See yonder maker of the dead man's bed,</L>

have I felt with indignant reluctance my wandering heart engaged in other specu∣lations, when called to minister at the grave, and to consign to the tomb the ashes of my fellow-creatures!</P>
<P>Yet nothing teacheth like death:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Wait the great teacher death.</P>
<BIBL>Dr. YOUNG.</BIBL></NOTE> and though perhaps the business of life would grow torpid, and the strings of activity be loosed, were men continually hanging over the meditation—yet, assuredly, no man should fail to keep the great object in view; and seasonably to reflect that the important moment is coming, when <HI>he</HI> too must mingle with his kindred clay; when he too must appear before God's awful judgment-feat; when he too must be adjudged by a fixed, irrevocable, and eternal decree.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment. <BIBL><HI>HEB. ix. 27.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>And, "Oh Death, mighty conqueror, I could not forbear saying, in the silence of unaffected meditation—Oh Death, how terrible, how wonderful thou art!

<P>Let me then not labour to divert the improving speculation, but advance still nearer, and see, if I can learn, what it is to die!</P>

<P>They stop:—and ah, my friend, what all this labour, and all this difficulty to drag thy body in its last narrow dwelling from the confinement of the hearse, and to bear it along the church-yard to its gloomy mansion in the church! Ah, where is thy former activity—thy wonted spright∣liness and vigour! Thou who didst tread over the threshold with such lively strength, and brushed away the dew of the morning with stout and nimble vivacity; have thy feet too forgotten to do their office?

and the fairest, the greatest and the best, as the meanest and most worthless of mankind! Though our friends be dear to us as a right eye; lovely as the bloom of the morning; powerful as the scepter∣ed monarch of the East; thou not only degradest them from the elevated height, but renderest obnoxious to the view; and inaccessible to the tender embrace of the last lingering, faithful, unshaken adhe∣rent; let corruption cease to be vain; let rottenness, and dust, no longer swell in brief and borrowed arrogance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following well-known lines may serve as a suitable comment and illustration of the above ob∣servations:

Confusion, anguish, and distress; weeping, lamentation, and woe; dismay and unutterable agony took up their residence in the dwelling of NEGO∣TIO! Surprised in the midst of youth, and in the ardour of earthly pursuits by the awful and irresistible summons of death, the <HI>husband,</HI> the <HI>father,</HI> the <HI>man,</HI> lay racked with such thoughts as his con∣dition might well be supposed to awaken.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a worldly-minded man, in the midst of youth, riches, and pleasure, to be laid on a sick bed, and in the apprehension of his friends, as well as his own, to be near the borders of dissolution, is surely a very awful condition, and much to be dreaded by every thoughtless candidate for sensu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ality and dissipation.</NOTE></P>
<P>Unable to bear the shock, his wife, who long sleepless had watched by his couch, was thrown on the ground in an adjacent chamber, and her little infants were weep∣ing around her, the more to be pitied, as unconscious of their misery, and wonder∣ing, with artless plaints, why their belo∣ved <HI>mamma</HI> was thus sad and in tears!

<P>When I sat down by his bed, and gen∣tly undrew the curtain, he looked—and shall I ever forget the earnest, anxious, speaking look? A tear dropt from his eye, he caught my hand, he strove to speak, but his full heart forbad; and the organs of speech, deeply affected by his malady, were unfaithful to the trust of words which he gave them: we sat silent for some time, and with difficulty at length I perceived that he said; or wished to say, <HI>"I fear it is too late.—Pray for me; for Christ's sake, pray."</HI></P>
<P>I endeavoured, as well as the affliction of my mind would permit me, to suggest every ground of hope, every motive of consolati∣on: he squeezed my hand, and sighed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Alas! what comfort or consolation can be ad∣ministered to a wicked man in the views of death and eternity?

<P>He lived only for this world. Full of hope, and buoyant with life; death was not in all his thoughts; and a future state, when suggested to him, was considered as unworthy his present concern, because it was judged so distant.

<P>Amidst these designs and pursuits, it might with too much truth be said of NE∣GOTIO, that God was not in all his thoughts.

<P>"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of mi∣sery! He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a sha∣dow; and never continueth in one stay.</P>
<P>In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased?</P>

<P>Were we truly influenced by the doc∣trine and piety of this incomparable pray∣er, there is no doubt but we should make a better estimate of Life and Death than is usually done; we should set a less va∣lue on the one, and meet the other with more courage and resignation.</P>
<P>For what is man, and what is his life —<HI>Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live,</HI>—short, indeed, suppose it to extend to the utmost length of human existence, even to fourscore years.

<P>Much more passed between us, some things far too tender to be committed to paper; and it will not be any wonder to the serious reader to be told, that a sick∣ness of some weeks was borne by a man of such faith, with all the chearful resig∣nation and consummate patience which are peculiar to the true Christian.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>It may well be said, religion has pleasures which none but the real Christian can enjoy; con∣solations which none but the real Christian can par∣take of, and a crown of glory promised to its fol∣lowers after death, which none but the real Chris∣tian can have a title to, or wear.</P>

The wisdom of the great Creator is immediately obvi∣ous in this gracious provision for the help∣less young; and it is certain that this powerful regard in the human species, may be rendered productive of the most excel∣lent effects.</P>
<P>Too commonly, indeed, it is grossly abused; and the honourable claim of pa∣rental regard is made the pretence for an unworthy and mean attachment to the pursuits of the world, and the love of this life. Many men cheat themselves under this specious delusion; and while they conceive that the spring of their actions, and the cause of their singular attention to earthly desires, is the laudable purpose of providing for their families;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A prudent desire and endeavour to make a suitable provision for our families, are laudable and praise-worthy; but an over-anxious pursuit after temporal things is hurtful and unbecoming, parti∣cularly respecting those who profess to be Christians.</NOTE> they are, the mean while, but following the bent of their inclinations, and treading in a track which they would continue to tread, were they not influenced at all by the motive which they fancy engages them in it.

experience hath manifested this; but it was never seen more evidently, per∣haps, than in the case of AVARO; who lived only for his children, as he con∣stantly avowed, and on that account deni∣ed himself every reasonable gratification; when, as if it were to falsify those preten∣ces, as well as to awaken him, if possi∣ble, to a more rational conduct, the So∣vereign of heaven deprived him of his children in a short compass of time; and lo, he remains the same grovelling earth∣worm, though he hath none to share that inheritance, which he purchases at the price of his soul!</P>
<P>If any truth be fully revealed in the sa∣cred oracles, if any hath the sanction of the soundest reason, it is the belief of a wise, good, and superintending Provid∣ence, of an universal Father, who tender∣ly watcheth over, and graciously careth for the concerns of those beings whom himself hath created, and placed in their several stations upon earth;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MATT. vi. 26.</NOTE> a truth of an aspect the most benign, and of an influ∣ence the most important to all the affairs of men: to forget and disregard which,

leads to all the folly of self-seeking, all the madness of self-dependance, all the bitter anxiety of self-corroding care: to remember, and live under the constant persuasion of which, induces all the sweet∣ness of a serene conscience, all the forti∣tude of a resigned soul, all the comfort of an unshaken hope.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Well might our Saviour upbraid his disciples with unbelief of his providential care, by saying,</HI> if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith!</P>

<P>And to this, were we to judge by the rules of right reason, or religion, that pa∣rental affection which is so universal and amiable, must naturally bend every pa∣rent: whom, if no other consideration were sufficient to persuade to the practice of religion, and to a dependance upon the Deity, the reflection of its infinite mo∣ment to their offspring, and of the un∣speakable value of the divine favour, should powerfully incline thereto.

the tender support of the husband, whose loss those very wants more feelingly teach her. Not only every source of usual sa∣tisfaction is dried up; not only every allowable and life-chearing comfort is cut off; but the flood-gates are open to a tide of new troubles, unknown, unthought of before: which the memory of past felici∣ties mournfully enhanceth; the retrospect of happiness once enjoyed, but now lost, adding double weight to the woe which springs up unwelcome in its place.</P>
<P>Even when the affection hath not been of the most tender sort, the loss of a hus∣band is severely felt; but where it hath been just and sincere, where long-tried fidelity hath much approved one to the other, there, as the parting becomes more afflictive, so the loss is more sensibly felt.

<P>This passage, I will freely confess to you, hath at all times given the greatest comfort to my mind, and at the same time encouraged me to a chearful discharge of my duty, and to perfect dependance on God; conscious, that if I could by any means secure the fatherly care of Omni∣potence for you, and my dear children, I need not be anxious for aught besides: I have endeavoured to keep this point in view; and I can now commend you to that care, with the most joyful and heart∣felt delight. For the Lord will never leave you nor forsake you:—he is em∣phatically styled, "the <HI>Father</HI> of the fa∣therless, and the <HI>Husband</HI> of the widow."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PSALMS, lxviii. 5.</NOTE> A reflection which surely must make every tender parent, every affectionate husband solicitously careful to obtain God's bless∣ing, if they really love their children; if they have a real regard for their wives and offspring; for the Lord God hath shewn,
<PB N="52" REF="030356_0057_0FE5CDEBB2534148"/>
all through his blessed word, how near and dear to him are the interests of the widow and the orphan: he hath given pe∣culiar laws, with much tenderness, res∣pecting them: he hath made it one of the characteristic parts of true and undefiled religion, to visit the <HI>fatherless</HI> and <HI>widows</HI> in their affliction;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JAMES, i. 27.</NOTE> and as an emblem of his ever full and flowing mercy towards them, he sent his Prophet to one of them in the day of her distress, and enriched her with a continual supply, while want and famine were reigning around: giving at once a proof and a significant token of his fatherly providence, and encreasing mercies to the <HI>widow</HI> who trusteth in him.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 KINGS, iv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>For, my dear love, permit me to say, though I have scarce any need to say it to you, that these rich promises to <HI>widows</HI> are not given indiscriminately and under no conditions: it may be very possible to languish in all the wretchedness of a wi∣dowed state, and yet to enjoy none of the distinguished care of heaven. St. <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="030356_0058_0FE5CDE858833908"/>
speaks of those who are <HI>widows indeed;</HI> which plainly implies that some in a state of widowhood may be far from the Divine notice. A <HI>widow indeed,</HI> according to him, "is one who trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayer night and day;" one who is truly sensible of the afflictive hand of Providence upon her; who endeavours to receive with meek∣ness, and to improve in resignation by the chastising stroke; who fixeth her soul's dependance upon the high and gracious providence of her god, and laboureth, with all the sincerity of faith, and fervour of prayer, to cast herself and all her con∣cerns upon him, as knowing he careth for her.</P>
<P>And as thus trusting in God and conti∣nuing in prayer, the widow should be particularly grave, serious, and sober in all her behaviour, dress, and deportment: she should not forget that God hath been pleased to cut off, if I may so say, the or∣nament of her head, and the pride of her life; and therefore requireth a decent so∣lemnity in all her carriage. If the loss happens to a woman in earlier life, she hath need of more peculiar watchfulness against all the attacks of carnal enemies; and should be very cautious not to give
<PB N="54" REF="030356_0059_0FE5CDE148449F78"/>
the least room for that reproach, either of wantonness or calumny, which some are so apt to impute to widowhood in general.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Would to God there were no widows in our day, but such who answered the above description.</NOTE></P>
<P>And should she, my dear, be left in your case, with a family around her, oh how much anxiety attends that necessary, that important charge; that most tender duty which she oweth to them—I cannot, indeed, I cannot speak of this heavy bur∣den: my heart is too full; and I have perfect satisfaction in your motherly love to my dear children.—But do not sink un∣der the burden, for God is with you: he will bless your endeavours; he will sup∣port you in every difficulty.—"Leave thy fatherless children to me, I will preserve them alive,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">JEREMIAH, xlix. 11.</NOTE> said he: <HI>alive,</HI>—that is, through Grace, <HI>alive</HI> to the only valuable, the <HI>divine</HI> life; <HI>alive</HI> to himself!

<P>HOW great a blessing is early instruc∣tion!—MISELLA never heard the sweetly persuasive lectures of wisdom; she was ne∣ver called to attend to the winning voice of religion and truth; and therefore, left to the blind conduct of impetuous passi∣ons, she was driven along, "to every wave a scorn;" she foundered and was lost!—We do not pretend to say, that early <HI>instruction</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> are so insepa∣rably connected as never to be divided: we do not say, that all who enjoy this ad∣vantage must go right; that all who enjoy it not, must infallibly go wrong.

<P>Had MISELLA, from her early infan∣cy been trained up in the knowledge of herself, her God, and her duty; had she been carefully led to a true estimate of her corruptible frame; not deceived into a wrong opinion of it, from poisonous flattery, and delusive adulation: had she been taught, that every good gift comes from God, and consequently can be no proper subject of human vanity; had she been taught, that God expects a proper return, and reasonable service for the bounty he shews; that our present state is a state of trial, that we are pilgrims and probationers of a day; and must necessa∣rily in a short time remove our tent from this world, and live—live everlastingly in another, happy or wretched, as we have performed our duty in this:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MATTHEW, xxv. 46.</NOTE>—Had these lessons of useful import been early and stedfastly imprinted on her mind; most probably the miserable parent had

not wept in such anguish, over his more miserable daughter: most probably her hands might have closed▪ with filial piety and tenderness, his aged eyes.</P>
<P>But—ah me!—how constantly do we behold these important lessons neglected! while fond and over-weaning parents, like those of MISELLA, cheat their little ones, even from infancy, into false opinions of themselves! The mistakes so frequent and so fatal, in the education of children, would almost lead one to approve the <HI>La∣cedemonian</HI> policy, which allowed not to parents the liberty of educating their own children, but committed this most neces∣sary business to the care of the state. And, from an accurate observation of the con∣duct of parents, how few have yet fallen within the observation of the writer of these lines, who were tolerably capaciated for the task!—who had prudence and forti∣tude enough to conquer parental prejudi∣ces; and to stand superior to the soft foi∣bles of melting affection.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>gentler</HI> sex, it is an evil too notorious to be denied, that 'ere the pretty innocents can lisp their pleasing tales, they are initiated into the school of pride and shew; taught to reverence dress

For it is a fact, I apprehend, scarcely to be controverted, that in the lower orders of life, more women are sedu∣ced into prostitution, through their love of dress, than through their love of vice: and in the higher, we know, to what lengths an attachment to this deep-rooted foible is carried.</P>
<P>With such principles, strongly impress∣ed, how can we expect to find in the fair one, the endearing and sensible compani∣on, replete, as <HI>Milton</HI> phrases it,—with all good, wherein consists <Q>Woman's domestic honour, and chief praise.</Q> How can we expect it—while, as he goes on they are—

<P>The happy BENVOLIO, with the per∣fect approbation of her parents, received this rich treasure to his embraces, and called the lovely PULCHERIA his, in her twenty-first year. He was the object of her choice, and his acknowledged worth well justified her heart's attachment to him. The fruits of her parents' care were now abundantly manifested; BEN∣VOLIO▪ thought—and justly thought—his lot peculiarly blessed, in a wise of so re∣fined and happy a disposition.

<P><PB N="87" REF="030356_0092_0FE5CDCD2CFA3C88"/>Her servants could never be lavish enough in her praises; for she treated them always with the most amiable hu∣manity: "she considered them, she used to say, as fellow-creatures, placed indeed in an inferior station; but not on that account the less acceptable in the sight of God. Nay, if we remembered, (she would observe) who it was that for our sakes took upon him the <HI>form</HI> of a ser∣vant, we should certainly treat our domes∣tics with becoming gentleness. Besides, she would go on, it appears to me an office of common humanity, to render a state of servitude and dependance as light and pleasing as possible: for while we by the bounty of Heaven, enjoy such superi∣or blessings, shall we not, in gratitude, do all in our power to bless others who are less favoured by Providence?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However different our stations in life may be, we are all of the same blood and therefore have no reason to be proud of ourselves, or to lord it over those who are below us; but to be humble, thankful and benevolent.</NOTE>—I esteem my servants as a kind of meaner, hum∣bler friends; and though I would on no account make myself too familiar with them, or listen either to their flattery or

<P>Acting upon these principles, she was the darling of her domestics; they beheld her with a degree of veneration. She was so happy as seldom to find cause to change; and she never entertained her friends with <HI>tedious tales</HI> of the ill behavi∣our and errors of her servants.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A practice too common with many in the pre∣sent day, but highly censurable and imprudent.</NOTE> I should observe, that she was careful to see them well instructed in their duty, and for that purpose she not only supplied them with proper books, but saw that they read them, while her beloved partner omitted no opportunity to assist in this necessary service.</P>
<P>Conscious of the high obligation upon all to observe the Sabbath, she strictly de∣voted that day to religion. She took care that such of her family as could possibly
<PB N="89" REF="030356_0094_0FE5CDF7B924D860"/>
be spared, should always attend with her at the morning and evening service of the parish church. This she esteemed an in∣dispensable duty;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How great the pity! that so many persons in the superior walks of life, content themselves with only going to church on Sundays, without suitably attending to, and constantly practising what they hear preached; hearing the gospel should always be accompanied with a life regulated by its pros∣pects.</NOTE> and never allowed herself to ramble from church to church, as was the case with some ladies of her acquaintance, in the neighbourhood, whose practice she constantly disapproved. "I owe this duty, she used to say, to my fa∣mily, to my neighbours, to my minister: and I cannot tell what evil may arise from a different example."</P>
<P>The evening of the Sabbath was always spent in religious exercises; and she ne∣ver would think of seeing company on that day. Routs on Sundays were mon∣sters in her apprehension. "I can ex∣cuse, she would often observe, those in the lower stations of life, who have no other day of leisure but the Sabbath, and who perhaps are pent up in narrow shops all the rest of the week, if they dedicate

Shall not the great giver of all, receive a tri∣bute of some small portion of our time?"</P>
<P>But were I to dwell upon all the excell∣ences of her life and conduct, the limits prescribed me in this paper would soon be exceeded. I shall omit, therefore, any account of the benevolent charity which she exercised so largely, (insomuch that never a child of distress went with a hea∣vy heart and unrelieved from her pre∣sence)—while I hasten to give some ac∣count of her death. Her constitution was delicate; after the birth of the second be∣loved infant which she brought her BEN∣VOLIO, (her first died early, and gave an opportunity for the display of the most exemplary resignation,) she caught a cold, which was accompanied with unhappy circumstances; and though she recovered in some measure, yet the consequence was an hasty decay.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="030356_0096_0FE5CE3F38582608"/>It is not easy to conceive the anguish of her parents and her husband upon so me∣lancholy an occasion; upon a discovery that all the efforts of art, and all the pow∣ers of medicine were in vain; while her patience and resignation obliged them to refrain from every word of repining,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We cannot but feel for and sympathize with those whom we love, when they are in pain and sorrow; but it is inconsistent for us as Christians to murmur or repine, being assured what God does ei∣ther respecting us or ours, is right and best.</NOTE> though it tended to increase their sorrow, by enhancing their esteem for her. Hap∣py as I was in her friendship, it was my custom often to visit her during her long and trying illness; but I shall not easily forget an interview at the close of it, which I must confess, wholly unmanned me, while it taught me the deepest humi∣lity.</P>
<P>I found her seated in the chair of sick∣ness, in her bed-chamber, with her little infant lying in her lap, over which she hung with such a look of maternal fond∣ness and anxiety, as I yet never saw, and which no painting could express! Soon as I advanced, she lifted up her eyes, in which stood the big and affectionate drops;
<PB N="92" REF="030356_0097_0FE5CDC660749030"/>
while death seemed to sit upon her coun∣tenance, wan, yet not void of that placid sweetness, which ever dwelt upon it.</P>
<P>"I was indulging, sir, said she, and I hope not improperly, some natural affec∣tion, and taking, perhaps,—my <HI>last</HI> leave of my poor little babe, who holds my heart too fast—(false and weak heart as it is) rather too fast bound to this transitory scene! Pretty innocent! see how it smiles on its weeping mother; unconscious yet of the bitterness of grief, and the sadness of tears.—Sweet babe! I must leave thee; the Father of heaven thinks fit, and his will be done.

love and wisdom ordains, must be best for his creatures. But when I look upon this dear innocent; when I consider the vari∣ous evils of the world, and the prevalence of our corrupt passions: when I consider the peculiar inconveniences of our sex, if deprived of maternal care and instruction my heart throbs with sensible anxiety— and I wish—O father of love, pity and pardon me! Must I, ah, must I leave this sweet harmless creature to all the trials and difficulties of life?—Oh my pretty babe, I <HI>must</HI> leave thee; but I shall in∣trust thee (and in that let me take com∣fort) intrust thee to a tender father, and to the protection of a Saviour and a God, who careth for his little ones. Blessed Saviour"—She was here overpowered by the strength of her affection: and fall∣ing into a fainting fit, from which we al∣most apprehended she would never reco∣ver, her husband and her parents were instantly called up; every effort was used to restore her; though grief suffered▪ no one present to utter a syllable. The scene was the most profoundly awful I ever be∣held.</P>
<P>At length she came to herself; and the first object she saw was her trembling mother bathed in tears, and holding her

clay-cold hand; on the other side stood her father; at her feet knelt her anxious and distressed husband—around her seve∣ral of us were placed, whose tears suffici∣ently witnessed our concern. She raised her languid eyes; gazed earnestly at us— then fixed them upon her mother, "Best and most beloved of parents, said she, farewell, farewell; God of his mercy re∣ward your tender care of me, and give us a meeting in the future world.—Oh my fa∣ther, and are you too there?—do not let me see your tears: support my poor mo∣ther, and remember you have a daughter gone before you, to that place, where all sorrow ceases:—But my husband"—She said no more; then threw her arms round his neck, and both mingled their tears to∣gether for some time. She sighed forth, "Best and most dear of men, let me thank you, sincerely thank you, for all the marks of your tender esteem. Be kind to my pretty babe; oh! why should I say be kind?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONGST the various arguments of consolation on the loss of our friends, that which is drawn from the pleasing hope of a future meeting, and perfect felicity, doubtless is the most persuasive. Grief subsides, and sorrow softens into a tenderly pleasing remembrance; when the soul is comforted with the happy ex∣pectation of one day seeing again—seeing never more to separate, those whom death
<PB N="98" REF="030356_0103_0FE5CF2FCFA2AB98"/>
hath torn from our affectionate embraces, and removed a little before us, to our fa∣ther's house.</P>
<P>The transporting thought suffers us no longer to lament our loss; the flame of our friendship is still kept alive, and the anxious fear of disappointment on our part, becomes an active principle of obedience and duty.—See in this view what we owe to our friends, and how careful we should be religiously to pass the short time of our pilgrimage here, that when we de∣part they may have scriptural grounds to believe, that our souls are with God; and that at his right hand they shall meet us, in the fulness of bliss.</P>
<P>What a comfort was this to the <HI>parents</HI> and friends of the amiable PULCHERIA: who, sensible of her constant attention to spiritual concerns, were well convinced, that her change was from mortality to glo∣ry, and therefore resigned her with chear∣ful thanksgiving to God; weeping over her, it is true, but weeping only the tears of gentle affection; and living always with a comfortable respect to that happy hour when again they should meet, after a me∣lancholy absence, to part no more for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="030356_0104_0FE5CED6B254D3A0"/>And shall it be?—Oh thou God of infi∣nite grace! ever studious of thy creature's felicity, various in thy bounties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd infi∣nite in loving kindness:—it must be so.

Thou too, my LANCASTER, loved friend of my youth, with whom so often I have roved along the banks of favoured <HI>Cam,</HI> and enjoyed all the sweets of virtuous, unpolluted friendship; thou too shalt rejoice my long∣ing sight! for never hast thou been wiped from the tablets of my memory; still have I borne thee, as a seal upon my heart; my first, my dearest, my disinterested friend!</P>

the surviving; less anxious so to live, that we may leave behind us the sweet odour of our memory, and the anxious desire to enjoy us again. Without this reciproca∣tion of mutual endearments, what is life, and what is man? Was he formed for himself, or can he be blest in unsocial ex∣istence? Can he be contented (nay then let him relinquish his claim to immortali∣ty) can he be contented to live without the love, to die without the tribute of friendly remembrance!—Can he be con∣tented to live the despiser of his God, and to die the affliction of his friends, who can never think without horror of his future existence! How then can they dry up their tears? Oh wretched parents of the more wretched MISELLA! my heart bleeds for you: I wonder not that ye refuse to be comforted.</P>
<P>Have we then any value for our friends, are they really dear to us, do we wish to remove every cause of anguish from their souls, and to wipe off every tear of dis∣tress from their eyes?—Let this be a mo∣tive to influence our conduct, and to ren∣der us active in the discharge of every duty to God and to them; that so when we are summoned to that future and important
<PB N="102" REF="030356_0107_0FE5CEF78F3EDCD0"/>
world, they may close our eyes with peace, and say with heart-felt satisfaction, "Fare∣well, oh farewell, thou dearest, best-lov∣ed friend! Thy life, thy love, thy faith, leave us no room to doubt of thy felicity. Thou art happy—we mourn only for our∣selves. Yet soon, very soon, we hope to meet thee again.—Then farewell only for a little while: we will ever bear thee in most faithful remembrance; and treading in the paths of thy virtues, will hope speedily to receive thy reward."</P>
<P>How desirable to leave this world, thus lamented and beloved! How much better than to drag out a contemptible existence through threescore and ten worthless years, and at length to drop into the grave, and there to rot, without one longing wish from one lamenting friend?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They who live unbeloved, may naturally ex∣pect to die unlamented.</NOTE></P>
<P>The contrast, perhaps, may strike us; let us view it in BUBULA; whose funeral obsequies I saw lately performed, with all the pomp and vain parade of ostenta∣tious pride; yet though carried to the silent tomb, with all this farce of shew,
<PB N="103" REF="030356_0108_0FE5CF782AD0D0C0"/>
no eye dropt a tear, and no heart heaved a sigh when BUBULO ceased to breathe.</P>
<P>Full threescore years and ten had BU∣BULO encumbered with his heavy load, this sublunary world; and it would be difficult to point out any works of benevo∣lence or religion, any works of real worth or humanity, which distinguished these se∣venty years. Fond of vile pelf, the earth∣worm continually toiled to add to his heap; and though rich, and daily encrea∣sing in wealth, could never prevail upon himself to communicate of his riches to others, or to serve his nearest relations. Yet smooth were his words, and fair were his promises; and who that knew him not, would have thought him any other than an universal friend to mankind?</P>
<P>The hours which were not devoted to gain, were consecrated to the service of his nice and enormous appetite, to de∣vouring of flesh, and drinking of wine. He was, in this respect, a perfect animal: and who that saw him at a city feast ever thought him of a superior order? His fa∣culties were almost entirely absorbed by this life of indulgence and gluttony: yet stupid as he appeared to be, he could pre∣tend to scoff at Religion, to deny even
<PB N="104" REF="030356_0109_0FE5CF1FDB84CCC0"/>
the being, and to despise the revelation of God.—What a dreadful character! from such slaves of the devil and heirs of hell good Lord deliver us.</P>
<P>He found a <HI>female</HI> willing to submit to the slavery of his dominion: she brought him three children, and happily was soon freed from her captivity. The eldest son continued a kind of superior servant to him, till his death, which he had long impatiently wished for, and at length heard of with joy. The younger, of a more sprightly disposition, unbiassed by princi∣ples, rushed headlong into the practice of all fashionable vices, and being unassisted by his father, committed some actions which obliged him to secure himself, by a voluntary banishment to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> His daughter, though frequently asked in marriage, could never prevail upon him to forward her happy settlement in life:— he could not spare a fortune for her; she continued with him, therefore, in a state of discontent, and added but little to his felicity by her filial duty, as he was so averse to make any addition to her's by his parental regard. He saw his widowed <HI>sister,</HI> with many little orphans, surround∣ed with a variety of difficulties; and per∣suaded at length to undertake her affairs,
<PB N="105" REF="030356_0110_0FE5CED4030BF010"/>
embroiled them more and more; and in conclusion gave them up, because his <HI>own</HI> business and concerns would not allow him sufficient time to attend to them.</P>
<P>A long and wasting illness warned him of eternity:—he would not receive the warning. He dreaded death, yet would not prepare to die. The jovial associates at the tavern and the club, forsook and forgot him:—his servants attended on, but cursed him:—his children thought every day of his existence too long:—the few dependants, which his money occasi∣oned, ceased to regard him, and paid their respects chiefly to his son. BUBULO observed it, and it grieved him to his very soul. He sent for more and more physi∣cians; they wrote, shook their heads, and took their fees: all hope was gone. The minister of the parish was sent for.—He found the almost lifeless wretch weeping, and lying along the ground; for he would be removed from his bed; but not having strength to support himself, he fell down, and in a few moments died.—Nobody wept, for nobody had cause to weep: the pride of the family gave him a pompous funeral,—and now he is forgotten!</P>
<P>Think not, oh reader, the character of
<PB N="106" REF="030356_0111_0FE5CF8CB30B4A90"/>
BUBULO exaggerated. He lived!—and alas, too much it is to be feared, there are many such BUBULO'S living, whose example should inspire us with detestation of a <HI>life,</HI> which must certainly end in a <HI>death</HI> not less dreadful.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>N. B. A friend of the writer of these reflections is pleased to observe, "The Reflections on <HI>Death</HI> please me much. But don't you carry things ra∣ther too far, when you say, (in your 7th chapter) "'tis an indespensible duty to go to our parish church."—Was I to live in London, I should rarely or never go to my parish church, <HI>if I had a stupid humdrum minister.</HI> I long to live in London, that I might hear <HI>clever</HI> men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—I disapprove as much as you can do, running after Methodist preachers and <HI>enthusiasts;</HI> but should I not prefer a <HI>Sherlock</HI> at the Temple, if I liv'd in Fleet-street, to, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is a misfortune, that when gentlemen quote, they will not refer to the work, and observe the words—It is not said positively, in the place refer∣red to, that "it is an <HI>indispensible duty, &amp;c."</HI>— The writer of the Reflections doth not deliver his own sentiments in that place; he only says, (see p. 89.) that the lady, whose character is given, PUL∣CHERIA, esteemed it (for her part) an <HI>indispensible</HI> duty. It did not follow from thence, that the wri∣ter of these Reflections thought it so: though being thus called upon by a man of sense and learning, (as his friend confessedly is,) he is now ready to declare, that he sincerely thinks there can be but very few exceptions. As to that of a <HI>Sherlock,</HI> it is too peculiar to be drawn into example.—But what would this gentleman say of those, who, loose to all connections with their parish minister, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would leave a <HI>Sherlock,</HI> nay, and esteem him a legal preacher <HI>without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ction, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> to hear a <HI>butcher,</HI> or a <HI>weaver,</HI> a man without learning, nay, it may be, a stranger to his own mother tongue?</P></NOTE>

<P>How different was the <HI>death,</HI> and ah! how different was the life of my neighbour AGRICOLA; who often, though in vain, I have endeavoured to wean from the world, and to shew the deceit and delusi∣on of all earthly attachments. But alas, he would not believe? AGRICOLA was a wealthy and laborious farmer; it might, strictly speaking, be said of him, that "he rose up early, and late took rest, and eat
<PB N="112" REF="030356_0117_0FE5CEF8EBD26628"/>
the bread of carefulness."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALMS, cxxvii. 2.</NOTE> He prevent∣ed the morning's dawn, and called the hinds to the field, ere the rosy sun peeped over the misty mountains. The <HI>flail,</HI> ear∣ly heard resounding in his barn, awakened the rest of the village, and was industry's summons to arise. His shepherds first drove their flocks a-field; and as the bleating multitude poured from their eotes, AGRICOLA stood by, and beheld with rapture the whiteness of their fleeces, and the strength of his sportive lambs. The neighbouring markets saw him always first to enter, and last to leave the scene of commerce and advantage; his samples were always ready, and were always best.</P>
<P>Thus he pursued temporal things with unwearied application, and unremitted di∣ligence; but for <HI>eternal</HI> things, AGRICO∣LA never once heeded, never once thought of them! What then? Did not AGRICOLA believe in God, in providence, in eternity? Oh yes, he believed all this;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>True</HI> faith on a firm belief in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se great and glorious doctrines of divine revelation, will never leave manknd to live, (as the common phrase is) as they list, or to act without thought and considera∣tion, but will more or less influence the life, and regulate the conduct.</NOTE> but he had no time to think of such things! <HI>"Hereafter,"</HI>

was his word; it will be soon enough "here∣after." What then?—Did AGRICOLA for∣sake the weekly service of the church, and wholly relinquish the worship of God?— Oh, by no means. AGRICOLA never or very rarely was absent from the divine service: he generally invited the curate of his little village—(a poor laborious man, like himself, who rode with all haste from parish to parish, and served three distant churches!) He generally invited him to a regale at his house on the sabbath; when the time would allow, the good man em∣braced it with thankfulness; they drank together in friendly sort; and behold, their conversation was of "the oxen in the field." AGRICOLA had sagacity enough to discern this impropriety in the conduct of the <HI>man of God.</HI> His <HI>Rector's</HI> rare ap∣pearance in this village, and ready ac∣ceptance of his tythes, gave him also no very favourable idea of religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From such worldly minded rectors and curates, Good Lord deliver us.</NOTE> He
<PB N="114" REF="030356_0119_0FE5CF2E79EDBA28"/>
He judged these men <HI>servants</HI> of the Lord for the wages of the world; and appre∣hended all religion to be merely <HI>lucrative</HI> and <HI>earthly.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alas! how many endeavour only to make a gain of godliness, and follow Jesus, merely for the loaves and fishes.</NOTE> He was desirous to believe it such; hence in the ale-house, at the markets, and in the little club of his vil∣lage-neighbours, he frequently delivered his sentiments with freedom, when God and his <HI>priests</HI> were sure to be treated with little or no respect.</P>
<P>AGRICOLA continued his course of life for some years; only as his money encrea∣sed, so encreased his heart's attachment to it;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is frequently observed, and too often verefi∣ed, the more we have, the more we want.</NOTE> and (as the world was fond to say) his regard to probity diminished as his pos∣sessions were multiplied. The widows and the poor complained of his rapacity and extortion; the fields spoke his covetous∣ness; for he encroached upon his neigh∣bours' lands, and the ancient boundaries were rendered disputable. The markets were said to be forestalled, and his abun∣dance became the source of oppression to
<PB N="115" REF="030356_0120_0FE5CEAEAF5A3CF8"/>
the poorer farmer: he wished to stand a∣lone; and beheld with a malevolent eye, the flocks, the herds, and the crops of others —He grew surly, proud, and insolent: vainly imagining that his wealth gave him an importance, and a right to tyrannize over his inferior neighbours.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wealth may naturally claim some degree of homage and respect from the sons and daughters of poverty and indigence, but never should (though it too often does) create in the possessors of it, pride, or self-importance.</NOTE> My con∣nections with him afforded me an oppor∣tunity often to remonstrate: he sometimes heard and promised fair, but he heard more frequently with impatience, and would have spoken his dislike, if worldly motives had not compelled him to silence.</P>
<P>Happy had it been for him if he had heard, regarded, and been wise. Happy for him if he had trusted less to that <HI>"hereafter,"</HI> which never came! For as last summer he attended his reapers in the field, suddenly the heavens grew black with clouds; the sun withdrew his light; the air seemed to stagnate with intolerable fervor; the lightning flashed with unre∣mitting fury; vast peals of thunder burst
<PB N="116" REF="030356_0121_0FE5CEB71FC27670"/>
fearfully around; there was no place to fly unto; they were exposed to all the ter∣rors of the storm. AGRICOLA stood aghast —when behold, the thunder-bolt of Om∣nipotence, (a sheet of living flame disclo∣sing itself over his head,) in a moment struck him a blackened corpse to the ground!</P>
<P>Oh horrible! most horrible! thus to be sent to our final account!—And shall not the death of AGRICOLA instruct us? Wilt thou, O Man, after such an admonition, persevere in forgetfulness of duty and at∣tachment to the world!—canst thou secure thyself from so deplorable an end?—No! thou canst not; thou canst not promise to thyself one future moment!—Death lies concealed in every path we tread, and his stroke will ever be <HI>sudden</HI> and <HI>dreadful,</HI> in proportion to the degree of our <HI>forgetful∣ness</HI> of that stroke, and our attachment to the vain delights, or possessions of the world.</P>

<P>IT gives the Author of these <HI>Reflections</HI> singular pleasure to have the approbation of a <HI>lady,</HI> so justly admired for her taste as Lady —. He esteems it a particular favour that she condescends to make a re∣quest to him, which he most readily grants, as assured, that the letter which she desires him to admit, will not only be pleasing, but highly instructive to his serious read∣ers. The death of Mr. NASH drew her thoughts to it, and therefore she is pleased to inform me, she copied it out for the be∣nefit of the public: it was sent by a person of known worth and piety, some years since, to that son of pleasure.—What effect it had, his future life, alas! did but too plainly shew!</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To RICHARD NASH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at Bath.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes from your sincere friend, and one that has your best interest deeply
<PB N="118" REF="030356_0123_0FE5CF00EBEAC858"/>
at heart. It comes on a design altogether important, and of no less consequence than your everlasting happiness: so that it may justly challenge your careful regard. It is not to upbraid or reproach, much less to triumph and insult over your miscon∣duct:—no, 'tis pure benevolence, 'tis dis∣interested good-will prompts me to write; so that I hope I shall not raise your resent∣ment. However, be the issue what it will, I cannot bear to see you walk in the paths which lead to death, without warning you of your danger, without sounding in your ears the awful admonition, "Return and live:—For why will you die?" I beg of you to consider whether you do or not, in some measure, resemble those unhappy children of ELI, whom, though they were famous in their generation, and men of renown, yet vengeance suffered not to live. For my part, I may safely use the expostulation of the old priest:—"Why do you such things?" for I hear of your evil doings by all this people. Nay, my brother, for it is no good report I hear; you make the Lord's people to transgress." I have long observed and pitied you; and a most melancholy spectacle I lately be∣held, made me resolve to caution you, lest you also come into the same condem∣nation.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="030356_0124_0FE5CEC1DB490028"/>I was not long since called to visit a poor gentleman, ere while of the most ro∣bust body, and of the gayest temper I ever knew. But when I visited him, oh how was the glory departed from him! I found him no more that sprightly, and vivacious son of joy, which he used to be; but lan∣guishing, pining away, and withering un∣der the chastising hand of God. His limbs feeble and trembling; his countenance forlorn and ghastly;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALMS, cxxvii. 2.</NOTE> and the little breath he had left, sobbed out in sorrowful sighs! His body hastening apace to the dust, to lodge in the silent grave,—the land of darkness and desolation. His soul just go∣ing to God who gave it;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ECCLESIASTES, xii. 7.</NOTE> to enter upon an unchangeable and eternal state.</P>
<P>When I was come into his chamber, and had seated himself on his bed, he first cast a most wishful look upon me, and then began as well as he was able to speak —"Oh that I had been wise, that I had known this, that I had considered my lat∣ter end! Ah! Mr. —, Death is knock∣ing at my door: in a few hours more I
<PB N="120" REF="030356_0125_0FE5CF94A5020B78"/>
shall draw my last gasp; and then comes judgment, the tremendous judgment!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ECCLESIASTES, xii. 14.</NOTE>— How shall I appear, unprepared as I am, before the all-knowing and omnipotent God! How shall I endure the day of his coming."</P>
<P>When I mentioned, among many other things, that holy Religion which he had formerly so slightly esteemed, he replied (with a hasty eagerness) "Oh that Reli∣gion is the only thing I now long for.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Tis <HI>this</HI> alone,</L>
<L>Amidst life's pains, abasements, emptiness,</L>
<L>The soul can cherish, elevate and fill.</L></Q></NOTE> I have not words to tell you how highly I value it; I would gladly part with all my estate, large as it is, or a world, to have lived in the practice of it. Now my be∣nighted eyes are enlightened, I. clearly discern the things that are excellent.</P>
<P>What is there in the place whither I am going, but God? or what is there to be desired on earth, but Religion?—But if this God should restore you to health, said I, think you that you should alter your
<PB N="121" REF="030356_0126_0FE5CED525E683C0"/>
former course?—"I call heaven and earth to witness, said he, I would labour for holiness as I shall soon labour for life. As for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches and pleasures, and the applauses of men, I account them as dross and dung, no more to my happiness than the feathers that lie on the floor.</P>
<P>"Oh if the righteous judge would try me once more; if he would but reprieve and spare me a little longer—in what a spirit would I spend the remainder of my days? I would know no other business, aim at no other end, than perfecting my∣self in holiness. Whatever contributed to that, every means of grace; every oppor∣tunity of spiritual improvement, should be dearer to me than thousands of gold and silver—But alas, why do I amuse myself with fond imaginations? The best resolu∣tions are now insignificant, because they are too late. The day in which I should have worked is over and gone, and I see a sad, horrible night approaching, bring∣ing with it the blackness of darkness for ever. Heretofore, (woe is me!) when God called, I refused; when he invited, I was one of them that made excuse.—Now, therefore, I receive the reward of my deeds; fearfulness and trembling are come
<PB N="122" REF="030356_0127_0FE5CF4BACC26B78"/>
upon me: I smart, I am in sore anguish already; and yet this is but the beginning of sorrows!—It doth not yet appear what I shall be—but sure I shall be ruined, un∣done, and destroyed with an everlasting destruction!"</P>
<P>This sad scene I saw with my eyes; these words, and many more equally af∣fecting, I heard with my ears; and soon after attended the unhappy gentleman to his tomb. The almost breathless skeleton spoke in such an accent, and with so much earnestness, that I could not easily forget him or his words. And as I was musing upon this sorrowful subject, I remember∣ed Mr. N—SH; I remembered, you, Sir— For I discerned too near an agreement and correspondence between yourself and the deceased. "They are alike, said I, in their ways, and what shall hinder them from being alike in their end? The course of their actions was equally full of sin and folly, and why should not the period of them be equally full of horror and dis∣tress? I am grievously afraid for the sur∣vivor, lest as he lives the life, so he should die the death of this wretched man, and his latter end should be like his.</P>
<P>For this cause, therefore, I take my
<PB N="123" REF="030356_0128_0FE5CF8D806B73D0"/>
pen to advise—to admonish—nay, to re∣quest of you to repent while you have an opportunity, if haply you may find grace and forgiveness. Yet a moment, and you <HI>may</HI> die; yet a little while, and you <HI>must</HI> die:—And will you go down with infamy and dispair to the grave, rather than de∣part in peace, and with hopes full of im∣mortality?</P>
<P>But I must tell you, Sir, with the ut∣most freedom, that your present behaviour is not the way to reconcile yourself to God. You are so far from making atone∣ment to offended justice, that you are ag∣gravating the future account, and heaping up an increase of wrath against the day of wrath. For what say the scriptures? those books, which at the consummation of all things, the ancient of days shall open, and by which you shall be judged—What say those sacred volumes? They testify and declare to every soul of man,—"That whoso liveth in pleasure, is dead while he liveth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 TIMOTHY, v. 6.</NOTE> So that while you roll on in a continued circle of sensual delights and vain entertainments, you are dead to all the purposes of piety and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="030356_0129_0FE5CF6A12355C98"/>Think, Sir, I conjure you, think upon this before it is too late, if you have any inclination to escape the fire that will ne∣ver be quenched. Would you be rescued from the just vengeance of Almighty God? Would you be delivered from weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth? Sure you would! But you may be certain that will never be done by amusements, which, at the best, are trifling and impertinent; and therefore if for no other reason, foolish and sinful. 'Tis by seriousness; 'tis by re∣tirement and self-examination, you must accomplish this great and desirable deli∣verance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis good for every rational creature upon earth, frequently and seriously to ask himself, what am I? what was I created for? and whither am I going?</NOTE> You must not appear at the head of every silly diversion, but enter in∣to your closet, and shut the door: and commune with your own heart, and search out your own spirit. The pride of life, and all superfluity of naughtiness must be put away. You must make haste, and de∣lay not the time to keep (and with all your might too) all God's holy commandments. Always remembering that mighty sinners must be mightily penitent; or else be mightily tormented.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="030356_0130_0FE5CEAC26ED39A8"/>Your example, and your projects have been extremely prejudicial, I wish I could not say fatal and destructive to many: for this, there is no amends but an alteration in your conduct, as signal and remarka∣ble as your person and name.</P>
<P>If you do not by this method remedy in some degree the evils which you have sent abroad, and prevent the mischievous con∣sequences which may ensue,—wretched will you be, yea wretched to all eternity. The blood of souls will be laid to your charge; God's jealousy, like a consuming flame, will smoke against you; as you yourself will see in that day, when the mountains shall quake, and the hills melt, and the earth be burnt up at his tremen∣dous presence.</P>
<P>Once more then, I exhort you as a friend; I beseech you as a brother; I charge you as a messenger sent from the great God, in his most solemn words:— "Cast away from you your transgressions; make you a new heart and a new spirit; so iniquity shall not be your ruin."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">EZEKIEL, xvii. 30, 31.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="030356_0131_0FE5CEB006998B70"/>Perhaps you may be disposed to con∣temn this, and its serious purport; or to recommend it to your companions as a fit subject for raillery.—But let me tell you before-hand, that for this, as well as for many other things, <HI>God will bring you in∣to judgment.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ECCLESIASTES, xi. 9.</NOTE> He sees me now I write: he will observe you while you read. He notes down my words in his book; he will also note down your consequent procedure. So that, not upon <HI>me,</HI> but upon your own <HI>self,</HI> will the neglecting or despising my friendly admonition turn. "If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it."</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With hearty good wishes for your wel∣fare, I remain, Sir, your unknown friend,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The writer of these <HI>Reflections</HI> thought him∣self obliged to retain this letter, (which, however, he has taken the liberty to correct in a few places) not only out of respect to the <HI>Lady</HI> who communi∣cated it, but because it was published in the <HI>Christi∣an's Magazine,</HI> in the regular course of the <HI>Reflec∣tions.</HI> He finds it too in a life of Mr. NASH, lately published, and was therefore the rather inclined to retain it, as that biographer seems to think it too severe, and is inclined to palliate a life of utter dissipation▪ which certainly merited the severest strictures.</P>
<P>No man living can have a higher regard for be∣nevolence and humanity than the writer of these lines: but he thinks benevolence to the <HI>soul</HI> of a much higher nature than that of the body; and would be far from leading those who are treading the insidious paths of pleasure with too eager de∣light, into delusive and dangerous opinions, as if tenderness of heart, and acts of charity, could atone for every other deficiency. Dissipated and fond of pleasure as we are, little need is there to encourage men in so false a pursuit. It is hoped, therefore, that the writer of NASH'S life, (who he is, I know not,) in a future edition, would strike out that of∣fensive and hurtful passage, which every sincere Christian must disapprove, wherein he asserts,— "That there was nothing criminal in his (NASH'S) conduct:—that he was a <HI>harmless</HI> creature, whose greatest vice was <HI>vanity,</HI>—and that scarce a <HI>single action</HI> of his life, except one, deserves the <HI>asperity</HI> of <HI>reproach.</HI>" And this is said of a man, who, with a heart of exquisite humanity, and which might have been moulded into the noblest form,—was yet, through life, a gamester profest, and an encoura∣ger of illegal gambling!—a follower of pleasure all his days, and a perpetual dissipater!—and whose conversation was made up of trifling, of falshood, and of immorality!</P>
<P>In matters which concern the souls of men, let us be especially careful; for fatal, indeed, may it be to betray them into wrong opinions. In other respects we will unite to applaud Mr. NASH, and will readily join his Panegyrists;—we will be thankful to him for the improvements he has made at <HI>Bath,</HI> by his means the most elegant and plea∣sing of all public places; and we will be thankful to the editor of his life, for the amusement and sa∣tisfaction we have received from so well-wrote and entertaining a performance.</P></NOTE> &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>IN our two foregoing chapters, we have two very different and alarming charac∣ters before us; each sufficient to shew us the vanity of this life, and to awaken in our souls an earnest attention to future concerns. The one, cut off by a sudden blast from heaven in the full bloom of days, and the vigour of health; the other, dragging through a length of wearisome years a feeble existence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. NASH died at <HI>Bath</HI> in February, 1761, aged 88, "The <HI>man</HI> was sunk long before, as one expresses it, in the weakness and infirmities of ex∣hausted nature."</NOTE> to <HI>the last scene of all.</HI></P>

<L>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SHAKESPEARE.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Old age is honourable, and hath its ad∣vantages.—But might I presume, Oh! thou Almighty and All-wise! short-sighted as I am, and incapable at the best to dis∣tinguish my real good from evil, might I presume to judge, or to ask any thing of thee respecting my future state in this poor and perishing world, I would humbly say, "Suffer me not to bear the load of life when every faculty is benumb'd, when every power of enjoyment is past; when oblivion darkens the memory, and all the senses seem wearied and sealed up; when the power of being useful to mankind is totally removed; nay, when the power of pleasing is no more, and we become a burden even to our nearest friends."</P>
<P>See the trembling, palsied HASSAN! unable to move; scarce able to utter in∣telligible sounds; weak in his sight, im∣perfect

in hearing; oppressed with pains; forgotten by the world; forsaken by all; and attended only by a distant relation, whom interest alone keeps with him, im∣patient for his departure, and anxious to possess his wealth. Yet though thus mi∣serable, despised, forsaken, and forgotten; HASSAN loves the world; clings faster to it, the more it shrinks from his embraces; detests the thoughts of death; and thinks and talks of nothing with satisfaction, but the delusive mammon of unrighteousness.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUKE, xvi. 9.11.</NOTE> Oh, what an old age is this! How wretch∣ed an issue of a long and useless life!— Fourscore years have been passed to no end, but the procuring of wealth. Four∣score years are over; the wealth is procu∣red; the man is about to die, and he hath neither child nor friend to inherit it! He hath no power to enjoy it himself; he is dead while he liveth: yet his affections are placed—not on things above,—but ah, sad reverse!—on things below. Can the world produce any object more pitiable or more contemptible than HASSAN?</P>
<P>Vigorous old age, the winter of an use∣ful, virtuous life, is as much to be desi∣red,

the great business of self-recollection. Yet is he no absolute hermit nor recluse; nor does he so live to himself as to forget the concerns of others; mild and affable, he delights in the conversation of his friends, and pleasingly instructs, while scarce seem∣ing to instruct; benevolent and humane, he listens to the voice of affliction, and is always the ready friend of the poor and the oppressed. Happy SOPHRON! he has not lived in vain; his youth was active; his old age is healthful, placid, and se∣rene.

<P>Uncertain as is the tenure of human life, this rule, one would conceive, should be universally regarded.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH death levels all distinctions, and pays no more deference to the crown, than to the unnoticed head of the meanest peasant; yet the <HI>great</HI> seem willing to pre∣serve, even in death, that distinction which they have shared in life; and therefore refuse to mix their mortal dust with com∣mon and inferior clay! There may be a propriety in this; subordination is absolute∣ly necessary, and it may be decent, that they who have been elevated in life, should at the close of it, still keep up their due dignity and distinction. But this will not prevent us from meditating in the vault of the <HI>Nobles,</HI> where surely we shall find am∣ple matter for contemplation.</P>
<P>By the side of the church, where first I was led into these <HI>reflections</HI> such a vault

is found. Let me descend into the solemn and sacred recess!—How awful!—As I tread slowly down the stone steps, which lead into it, a melancholy murmur seems to echo through the silent mansion; the moon just throws in a faint light, suffici∣ent for me to discern the contents, (though indeed no stranger to them) and all my soul thrills with an anxious dread and horror.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See HERVEY'S Meditations among the tombs.</NOTE>—Whence this strange, this un∣common fear upon us, when conversing with the deceased?

<Q><LG>

<BIBL>SOLITARY WALKS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Here are the great and the gay; the young and the brilliant; the honourable and the lovely, placed in no mean order or elegance together. Their coffins are decorated with velvet and with silver; but ah, their contents are only like vulgar dust —There lies the noble ALTAMOUNT; no wonder the remembrance of him first strikes every soul which descends into this vault, and was no stranger to his character. An able writer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. YOUNG, in his Centaur not Fabulous.</NOTE> hath given us a striking account of his last moments: let us first recollect this, and then make our reflecti∣ons upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="030356_0145_0FE5CF12431473C0"/>"I am about to represent unto you, says he, the last hours of a person of <HI>high birth;</HI> and <HI>high spirit;</HI> of <HI>great parts,</HI> and <HI>strong passions,</HI> every way accomplished, not least in iniquity. His unkind treat∣ment was the death of a most amiable wife, and his great extravagance, in effect, dis∣inherited his only child.</P>
<P>"The sad evening before the death of that noble youth, I was with him. No one was there, but his physician and an intimate friend whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he said:</P>
<P>"You, and the physician, are come too late.—I have neither life, nor hope.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is declared in the oracles of divine truth, that <HI>the wicked is driven away in his wickedness, but the righteous hath hope in his death,</HI> Prov. xiv. 32; hence learn the happiness of the one, and the misery of the other.</NOTE> You both aim at miracles. You would raise the dead."</P>
<P>Heaven, I said, was merciful.</P>
<P>"Or I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to bless and to save
<PB N="141" REF="030356_0146_0FE5CEA7D1A1E698"/>
me?—I have been too strong for Omnipo∣tence!—I have pluck'd down ruin."</P>
<P>I said, the blessed <HI>Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>"Hold! hold! you wound me!—That is the rock on which I split.—I denied his name."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>They who deny Christ on earth, he will deny in heaven.</P>
<BIBL>Matt. x. 53.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Refusing to hear any thing from me, or to take any thing from the physician, he lay silent, as far as sudden darts of pain would permit, till the clock struck. Then with vehemence he exclaimed—</P>
<P>Oh time!—time!—It is fit thou should'st thus strike thy murderer to the heart.—How art thou fled for ever!—A month!—Oh for a single <HI>week!</HI> I ask not for <HI>years.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Dr. Young may well say,</L>

<P><PB N="142" REF="030356_0147_0FE5CEC6EE551D50"/>On my saying, we could not do too much: that heaven was a blessed place—</P>
<P>"So much the worse.—'Tis lost! 'Tis lost! Heaven is to me the severest part of hell!"</P>
<P>Soon after I proposed prayer.</P>
<P>"Pray you that can; I never prayed, I cannot pray.—Nor need I. Is not Heaven on my side already? It closes with my conscience. Its severest strokes but second my own."</P>
<P>His friend being much touched, even to tears, at this (who could forbear? I could not) with a most affectionate look, he said:</P>
<P>"Keep those tears for thyself. I have undone thee—Dost weep for me? That's cruel. What can pain me more?—</P>
<P>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.</P>
<P>"No, stay, Thou still mayest <HI>hope;</HI> therefore hear me: how madly have I talked? how madly hast thou listened and believed? But look on my present state,
<PB N="143" REF="030356_0148_0FE5CECD9A3D8F50"/>
as a full answer to thee, and to myself. This body is all weakness and pain; but my soul, as if strung up by torment to greater strength and spirit, is full powerful to reason; full mighty to suffer. And that, which thus triumphs within the jaws of mortality, is doubtless <HI>immortal.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is no small proof or argument in favour of the soul's immortality.</NOTE> And as for a <HI>Deity,</HI> nothing less than an Al∣mighty could inflict what I feel."</P>
<P>I was about to congratulate this passive, involuntary confessor, on his asserting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature; when he thus very passionately exclaimed—</P>
<P>"No, no! let me speak on. I have not long to speak—My much-injured friend! my soul as my body lies in ruins; in scattered fragments of broken thought. Remorse for the past throws my thoughts on the future. Worse dread of the future strikes it back on the past; I turn and turn, and find no ray. Didst thou feel half the mountain that is upon me, thou wouldst struggle with the martyr for his stake, and bless heaven for the flame; this is not an

everlasting flame, nor that an unquencha∣ble fire."</P>
<P>How were we struck?—yet soon after, still more. With what an eye of distrac∣tion, with what a face of despair, he cried out—</P>
<P>"My principles have poisoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy; my unkindness has murdered my wife! And is there another hell?— Oh! thou blasphemed, yet most indulgent Lord God! Hell itself is a refuge, if it hides me from thy frown."</P>
<P>Soon after, his understanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or even forgot. And ere the sun (which I hope has seen few like him) arose, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accomplished and most wretch∣ed ALTAMONT expired.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let the young, wealthy, gay, and inconsider∣ate votaries of pleasure and dissipation, learn from the latter moments of the wretched Altamont, (who is supposed by some to intend the late Lord Bolingbroke) the folly of living unmindful of ap∣proaching death, and be convince of the truth of that common proverb, <HI>they who swim in sin, shall sink in sorrow.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>HOW doubly dreadful is Death, when it hurries away an affrighted and unprepa∣red soul from all the splendour and pomp of earthly greatness; from noble mansi∣ons; elegant gardens; beautiful and ex∣tensive parks; numerous attendants; large possessions; and all the bright circle of sublunary grandeur!</P>
<P>"And must I leave these? Curse upon my fate; must I leave all these? said the noble PUBLIO, as, stretched upon the bed of disease, he lay struggling with uncon∣querable pain, like a wild bull in the net; impatient and restless under the hand of Omnipotence; as the untamed lion, in the toils of the Lybian hunter.</P>
<P>Yes, PUBLIO, thou must leave all these; and, proud and vain as thou hast been of thy titles and honours; as much elevated

<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Why will men forget this obvious truth? Sure∣ly if the rich and noble would bear it in mind, it would be a powerful check against every motion of pride, and would instant∣ly crush the least appearance of elation.</P>
<P>If we look to <HI>this</HI> world only, how su∣perior are the advantages which the great and wealthy enjoy, how infinitely superi∣or to those which the poor and mean pos∣sess? But if we look beyond the <HI>present</HI> scene, nay, if we look only on the part∣ing moment, how great advantages have the serious poor over the thoughtless rich? Poverty denies to men the enjoyment of almost every thing which the wealthy call convenient and comfortable; much more of what they call elegant and pleasurable. But poverty disengages the affections from this transitory scene, and depriving men of the enjoyment, renders them more in∣different

to their continuance in the world. He who has nothing to leave behind him, must be supposed to quit the stage with in∣finite less regret, than he who is surround∣ed with every thing that can elevate the desires, or delight the heart of man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the rich may learn not to despise the poor, while the poor are taught not to envy or co∣vet the riches of the affluent, the honours of the nobles, or possessions of the great.</NOTE> Now if we were steady to our Christian principles, and fixed in our pursuits of the blessings of eternity, doubtless, in this view, poverty would be very far from be∣ing esteemed an evil.</P>
<P>But let us not conceal the truth; there is often more of envy and chagrin in our strictures on wealth and greatness, than a real contempt of these idols, or a true Christian renunciation of them. And it is to be feared, that our remarks respect∣ing their possessors, are frequently stretch∣ed beyond the line of truth. It is a point, of which long experience and close obser∣vation have left me no room to doubt, that the <HI>great</HI> are not the <HI>happy:</HI> I mean, that true felicity, and an exalted state,

<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Yet am I equally satisfied that the <HI>poor</HI> are not happy. If the disturbing, anxious, and higher passions, molest the repose of the former, the chagrining and vexatious passions sufficiently ruffle the quiet of the latter. In great goodness and condescen∣sion to his creatures, the all-wise disposer of all things hath made happiness peculiar to no state, and attainable in all; it is a plant which will thrive in every soil, though some may be more kindly to it than others. I have seen it blooming in all the verdure of the most flourishing palm tree, in the splendid palace of the noble: I have seen it fresh, beautiful, and fra∣grant, in the lowly dwelling of the peace∣ful and contented cottager. For the <HI>true</HI> Christian is the happy man; and he who is indeed a Christian, will find peace and joy, whether in a cottage or a palace.</P>
<P>What could have deprived the gay, the young, the noble, the ingenious, and most accomplished ALTAMONT, of happiness

Had he but known and practised the precepts of that divine religion, whose excellence is sufficiently marked by the name of him who revealed it,—<HI>Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God.</HI> Every earthly bliss crouded around the noble young man, sedulous to present themselves, and anxious to offer their sweets to his acceptance. Elegant mansi∣ons, highly furnished with all that art could bestow, were ready provided for him; parks, beautified with the finest lawns and most extensive prospects, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etch∣ed themselves around him; ample estates were in his possession, sufficient to supply every necessity, and sufficient for calls of magnificence, liberality, and charity; and heaven had blessed him with a mind ca∣pacious of the largest enjoyments, and with sense equal to the most elegant refine∣ments. Happy peculiarity—heaven had blessed him also with an amiable consort, whose virtuous endearments were them∣selves sufficient to have constituted solid bliss; and in whose love, scarce a man ex∣ists, who would not have thought himself crowned with his heart's full content.</P>
<P>Ah! wretched ALTAMONT,—the want of that Christian virtue which alone will

<P>But while I turn away with disgust from these fine, but misapplied efforts of art; that elegantly-simple monument strikes and delights me. It is the statue of the late Duke of —: it is finished in the highest taste; it affords the most exact re∣semblance of his person; the posture is the most natural and easy; proper for the place, serious and contemplative:—it is raised on a plain but beautiful pedestal; there are no fantastic decorations; the in∣scription contains nothing more than the name of this worthy nobleman, the date of his birth and death, and the detail of his illustrious issue. There needs no more, his virtues live in the faithful memory of his friends and of his country▪ and time itself cannot obliterate the impression,

<P>Methinks, as I stand contemplating this animated <HI>statue,</HI> I can fancy its noble ori∣ginal before me, as I often seen him, and imagine I hear him thus addressing me:— "See the end of all human grandeur, and learn to think nothing great in mortality; nothing can be truly great which is uncer∣tain; nothing can be truly good which must shortly have an end.

<P>In this elevated state I forgot not my∣self: I remembered that I was a man; that I was to give an account to a superi∣or tribunal, and that my punishment or reward would be pronounced according to the improvement or abuse of the trust re∣posed in me.

When I came to talk with EGENO, (so call we this poor man) concerning his soul, his faith, his hope, and future expectations; he fixed his eyes upon me with the most unuttera∣ble anguish, and elevating his emaciated hand, sighed out, "Alas! alas! Sir, sure I shall recover." "But if you should not, said I, as God knows there appears but little probability—what then? what says your conscience?"

<P>He heard me with attention, and I per∣ceived at length a tear stealing down his pallid cheeks. "I have been miserable, said the poor unhappy object, all the days of my life; and now I perceive that I must be miserable through all eternity too."

Oh who could refrain? to see a fellow-creature lying in exquisite distress, soul and body equally estranged from comfort, health, and ease! —Oh who could refrain? to see a fellow-creature thus about to perish, ignorant and hopeless, in a land where the glad ti∣dings of the gospel are so constantly and universally preached!</P>
<P>Moved with compassion, I endeavoured to offer some consolation—the utmost
<PB N="170" REF="030356_0175_0FE5CEDC244BAFE0"/>
which I dared to offer. For alas! how can the ministers of Christ exceed their commission; how can they speak peace to those, to whom there is no peace?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wick∣ed.</P>

<P>But from this melancholy office I was prevented by his wife, who came in the morning to inform me that he expired in the night; expired regardless, as it seem∣ed, of every thing; utterly stupid, sense∣less, and unheeding.</P>

<P><PB N="185" REF="030356_0190_0FE5CECEF712A9D0"/>But a funeral, at which I was called lately to officiate, leads me to postpone these reflections to a following chapter; that I may pay some tribute to the memo∣ry of an humble man, whose virtues de∣serve to be had in honour, though his low station denies him the loud applause of public celebrity. But why should fame be the prerogative of greatness; of world∣ly greatness and external splendor?—To do well, and to deserve in every station, is to be great, and ought to obtain praise —and will obtain praise!—Yes, ye sons of obscurity, whom no titles dignify,— whom no pedigrees ennoble,—but whose virtuous actions are more illustrious than either—yes, ye shall inherit praise, as much superior to that which men, the world, and time can give,—as God, as heaven, and eternity are superior to all these.</P>
<P>This bright and blessed honour is not conferred according to rank, birth, or ti∣tle;
<PB N="186" REF="030356_0191_0FE5CEDCEDEFEB10"/>
but to high and low, rich and poor, the glorious price is held forth alike, and to him who doeth best, shall the best re∣compence be given.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GENESIS iv. 7. ROMANS, ii. 6, 7.</NOTE>—Yet one sure me∣thod to obtain this blessing in that king∣dom, where all distinctions eternally cease, is to act and live agreeably to those dis∣tinctions and subordinations, which God hath wisely appointed upon earth: I mean the sure method to obtain God's favour, is to acquiesce thankfully in that station of life, wherein he hath placed us; and with entire submission, to discharge faith∣fully and uniformly all the duties of it.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">REVELALIONS, ii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>So thought the worthy man, whose de∣cent funeral was lately solemnized. He had been servant in a neighbouring family above twenty years; and during that time had abundantly approved himself by the strictest fidelity. A rare example, when the depravity of this order amongst us, is the subject of universal complaint, and the severest tax upon the domestic felicity of numbers! Though perhaps the cause and the remedy of the evil are both to be drawn
<PB N="187" REF="030356_0192_0FE5CEB6567F2BA8"/>
from other sources, than those which are generally proposed: to be drawn rather from the heads of families, than from those who act in menial capacities.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The influence of example in good masters is generally beneficial respecting servants:—would to God they had no other examples set before them.</NOTE> A prudent and conscientious master, for the most part makes prudent and regular ser∣vants; and it is from the increase of such examples, that we must expect improve∣ment in our attendants.</P>
<P>PETRUCIO, (so call we the subject of our present chapter) was happy in this respect; happy in a master, whose own life was regular, and whose great care was to discharge every duty, which he owed, particularly to his servants. He was well recompensed by the love and fidelity of his servants in general, but of PETRUCIO in particular. This faithful domestic had right notions of God, himself, and his duty. He murmured not at the inferiori∣ty and servility of his own condition: he knew it was the will of God; as such he received it with thankfulness, and lived in it with chearful content: considering him∣self as the servant of Christ, he acted con∣scientiously,
<PB N="188" REF="030356_0193_0FE5CEAA08F0F4A8"/>
as desirous to please <HI>him,</HI> and not man only.</P>
<P>Reflecting that the eye of God, if not of his master, was always upon him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Omnia cum videat, nulli Deus ipse videtur.</P>

<BIBL>GENESIS, xvi. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> and thought it a poor excuse for himself, if he could escape the notice of an earthly observer, while all his actions were minutely scan∣ned by him, who searches the inmost se∣crets of the heart. Hence he served not "as a man-pleaser, but as the servant of God, in singleness of heart as unto Christ; not with eye-service, but as the servant of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;" all his service was done with a good will, not with a morose restraint or sourness,—<HI>as to the Lord and not to man on∣ly</HI>—for he knew, and ever bore in mind that comfortable truth, "That whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">EPHES. vi. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="030356_0194_0FE5CEA459BC45A8"/>In consequence of these right principles, PETRUCIO ever esteemed his master's in∣terest, as essentially connected with his own: and would as soon have suffered the extremest punishment, as to have joined in any collusion to defraud, much more to have himself defrauded his master. It was his constant endeavour to preserve the strictest oeconomy in every part of his trust, and he would express the highest wonder and deepest abhorrence at many of those infamous arts, which modern po∣lite servants would frequently advise him to practise, and to which tradesmen, for the basest ends, would often attempt to allure him.</P>
<P>"Though I am in a state of servitude upon earth, he would often say, I hope to be in a state of freedom with God here∣after: but how can I hope for this, if I am deficient in those easy duties, which are required in my present station? For surely, when all the necessaries of life are found me, it is easy to be just and faith∣ful, honest and industrious—nay, gratitude itself alone should lead to this, for his sake, who provides so well for me; and who requires certainly that I should repay all his expence, with every worthy and

chearful endeavour possible on my part.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Would to God, servants in general. would take pattern from <HI>Petruchio,</HI> and think and act as he did; happy indeed would the master of such ser∣vants be, and happy would be servants in so doing.</NOTE></P>
<P>We may well believe that a servant with such notions, must be uniform and excel∣lent in his whole conduct. And such in∣deed was PETRUCIO. He received every order with silence and humility: he exe∣cuted every order with diligence and punctuality. He pretended not to be wi∣ser than his directors; and he was a stran∣ger to the odious malapertness, which is one of the distinguishing qualifications of contemptible modern <HI>valets.</HI> His long continuance in the family, had wrought in his breast a tender affection, not only for his master and mistress, but also for their children and relations: and at length their interest was become so peculiarly his own, that he shared in all their joys, and partook of all their sorrows.</P>
<P>The fruits of his fidelity were the con∣fidence and esteem of his master and mis∣tress; the affection of the family; the reverence of his fellow-servants; and a comfortable saving, on which he proposed
<PB N="191" REF="030356_0196_0FE5CED5ECF66810"/>
to live, if ever he should have cause to quit the service; and which, dying in it, he had the pleasure to bequeath to a wi∣dow-sister and, her children, whom it res∣cued from many difficulties, and placed in a happy situation, above dependence and necessity.</P>
<P>During the time of his last sickness, he frequently declared that the tenderness and regard of his master and mistress to him, more than overbalanced the merit of all his former services, and were an abund∣ant recompence to him. For PETRUCIO had a generous mind, and was sensible of affectionate treatment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gratitude is commendable and praise-worthy in all; from the poor and needy to the wealthy and benevolent, as well as from every rational creature under heaven, to their great Creator, Benefactor, and Preserver, who giveth to all liberally and up∣braideth not.</NOTE> His master every day visited his sick room, and read and prayed by his bed-side: his mistress with her own hands administered his medi∣cines, and took care to supply him with the most proper nourishment. His humi∣lity alone could equal his gratitude and thankfulness on such occasions; and when upon his expressing his great obligations
<PB N="192" REF="030356_0197_0FE5CEAACE62F008"/>
his mistress once said, that "this, and much more than this, was due for his faithful services." "And that word, ma∣dam, said the honest fellow, with tears in his eyes, that word is a reward sufficient for more than twenty times such services as mine."</P>
<P>Thus died this useful worthy man: and to do all honour to him, his master buried him at his own expence, with all the de∣cency and propriety conceivable:—six neighbouring farmers, tenants to his mas∣ter, bore his pall; his master and mistress walked as chief mourners; the rest of the family attended in procession, and had mourning given them on the occasion; and so great was the esteem in which this faithful servant was held, (who I should have observed was the willing and joyful hand by which his master and mistress distributed their liberal charities)—that scarce a dry eye was seen at his funeral: and his death and funeral, I persuade my∣self, have done more to reform the ser∣vants in that part of the world, than twenty lectures to them could have at∣chieved. "See how PETRUCHIO, though a servant, is honoured and respected!"— was the general cry: and the general rea∣son given on all hands was, "Because he was faithful, honest, and industrious."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="030356_0198_0FE5CEE29CAB2838"/>And let servants, in conclusion, be told, that if they would obtain such favour here, and such recompence as PETRUCIO doubtless hath obtained, their only method is to go and do likewise; is to imitate his example; is to make their master's inter∣est their own. The best motive upon which they can do this, is to consider, that in so doing they serve the Lord <HI>Christ,</HI> and may be assured, that, according to their fidelity, so shall they reap hereafter. For God is no respecter of persons.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ACTS, x. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>⁂ I subjoin to this chapter the follow∣ing excellent <HI>rules,</HI> which were sent by an unknown hand, entirely agreeing with the gentleman who sent them,—"That if they were hung up in all kitchens and servant's halls, (printed on a large sheet) they would be extremely useful."</P>

<P N="4">IV. Preserve your fidelity; for a faith∣ful servant is a jewel, for whom no en∣couragement cant be too great.</P>
<P N="5">V. Adhere to the truth, for falshood is detestable; and he that tells one lie, must tell twenty more to conceal it.</P>

<P N="9">IX. Be clean in your business; for slo∣vens and sluts are disrespectful servants.</P>
<P N="10">X. Never tell the affairs of the family you belong to; for that is a sort of trea∣chery, and often makes mischief; but keep their secrets, and have none of your own.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Live friendly with your fellow-ser∣vants; for the contrary destroys the peace of the house.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Above all things avoid drunken∣ness; for it is an inlet to vice, the ruin of your character, and the destruction of your constitution.</P>

<P N="15">XV. Be careful of your master's pro∣perty: for wastefulness is sin.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Never swear, for that is a sin without excuse, as there is no pleasure in it.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Be always ready to assist a fel∣low-servant; for good nature gains the love of every one.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Never stay when sent on a mes∣sage; for waiting long is painful to a mas∣ter, and quick return shews diligence.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Rise early, for it is difficult to recover lost time.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The servant that often changes his place, works only to be poor: for the rolling stone gathers no moss.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Be not fond of encreasing your acquaintance; for visiting leads you out of your business, robs your master of your time, and puts you to an expence you cannot afford: and above all things take care with whom you are acquainted, for
<PB N="197" REF="030356_0202_0FE5CFAB0EBD77D0"/>
persons are generally the better or the worse for the company they keep.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. When out of place, be cautious where you lodge; for living in a disrepu∣table house, puts you upon a footing with those that keep it, however innocent you are yourself.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII.

<P N="24">XXIV. If you are dissatisfied in your place, mention your objections modestly to your master or mistress, and give a fair warning, and don't neglect your business, nor behave ill, in order to provoke them to turn you away; for this will be a ble∣mish in your character which you must always have from the last place you serv∣ed.</P>

<P>The doctrine of a future judgment is peculiar to the Christian Revelation.
