<HEAD>THE HISTORY <HI>OF Capt.</HI> Thomas Parismas.</HEAD>
<P>PARISMAS was bred up to the sea, he was of a comely stature, well pro∣portioned, the most perfect symmetry was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his whole construction, his eyes at the same time they discovered the most tender sensa∣tions of mind, exhibited the strongest fea∣tures of fortitude and maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, his counte∣nance was serene as the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but at the same time displayed the most evident tokens of greatness, and was a proper in∣dex to a mind the most magnanimous, and a temper the most engaging; he was the pride of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquaintance, and the idle of the sex.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034307_0004_0FFD7EC0FA0F9A08"/>
At the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of twenty-one, he took the command of a ship in the India trade, the cargo of which was consigned to an English merchant, at CANTON, by the name of Negotio, he arrived safe at the Port, and delivered his charge to the merchant, who in return, shipped on board such goods as he was directed to, by the owner. While these things were carrying on, Negotio took his country man Parismas to his house, where he was introduced to his lady.—Parismas was struck with astonishment at the sight, beauty's perfections were all displayed, her eyes out shone the diamond, the ruby was rival'd by her lips, the rose faded when compared with the vivid colour of her cheeks, alabaster lost its whiteness when compared with her snowy bosom, her hair of a darkish brown hung in ringling tresses over her shoulders, her shape was the most exquisite that imagination can paint, she was decorated in her habit in all the magnif∣icence and pride of the east,</P>
<P>Her mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ited an epitome of all the accomplishment which human nature is capable of, in short, the famed Dejanira, or Flora the Grecian queen, with all the god∣desses of antiquity were by no means to be compared with this ne plus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itra of human perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034307_0004_0FFD7EC0FA0F9A08"/>
She received Parismas, with all that elegance of speech and gesture, which the height of female accomplishments and ac∣quirements are capable of inspiring: Parismas was at first lost in wonder, and was for a while totally incapable of return∣ing any kind of compliments, at length he recovred in accents scarcely articulate, made as good a return as his situation was cap∣able of admitting, but further acquaintance, though it by no means lessened his esteem of her: yet it gradually dimished the awe with which he was at first confounded, 'till he could stedfastly behold her without being confussed with her charms.</P>
<P>His business being compleated, Parismas took an affectionate farewell of Negotio, but infinitely more so of the all accomplished lady, who by this time had unintentionally made herself perfect master of his heart and affections. He left Canton, and embarked for London; sleepless nights and joyless days were by turns the melancholy com∣panions of his voyage home, he returned safely, much to the satisfaction of his em∣ployers, who assoon as circumstances would admit, sent him again to the same place on a similar errand: after a customary course he arrived safely at Canton again. The sight or the place reanimated every idea of his
<PB N="6" REF="034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088"/>lovely lady, for whose sake only he could wish to live, though his ideas of chasteical honour forbid his expecting or ever desiring to enjoy her.</P>
<P>He landed and directed his course to the House of Negotio, who received him with that genteel ceremony which the most refined in manners make use of to those they hold most dear, the same pleased vivacity sparkled in his countenance, which Parismas had formerly observed seated there, and he experienced every mark of ge∣nerosity as well as affability which Negotio had made use of on former occasions, every thing in his house appeared with the same grandeur and life as was usual, but to the great mortification of our Captain, his ado∣rable angel was not to be seen.</P>
<P>He asked no questions, supposing she was absent on a visit to some friend, at night he retired, but the most dismal forebodings that some dire fatality had be∣fallen her; at the return of morning, he again pursued the prosecution of his business, and again waited on Negotio, and for seven∣teen days successively, dined at his table, but with the most cutting mortification at not having the satisfaction of once beholding this admirable lady, or ever once hearing her name mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088"/>
At the expiraton of which time having his cargo all on board, &amp; a favourable wind presenting, he went to take his leave of Negotio, who, with the warmest expressions of friendship, was about wishing a pleasant and agreeable passage home, when Paris∣mas, whose heart suffered the most vexing anxiety to have some information with re∣gard to Negotio's lady, thus addressed him, Dear Sir, you appear possessed of the same tranquil disposition which always ornament∣ed you, and your circumstances in life ren∣der you a proper object of envy, yet there is one inquiry which labours in my swelling bosom, which I am no longer able to sup∣press, I hope therefore you will be so good as to pardon me, when I inquire after your amiable lady, as she has been absent these seventeen days; and I have not once heard her named: Is she living, or is she dead, or absent? his emotion of heart was so great that it was plainly perceivable by his uncommon accents. The undisturbed Negotio calmly replied, she is at home sir. May I be indulged with taking leave of her? said Parismas. O yes, reply'd Ngotio, I will introduce you to her if you desire it, but at the same time, as a friend, I advise you not to trust your curiosity too far, as the fight of her may not produce those agree∣able
<PB N="8" REF="034307_0006_0FFD7E9799682298"/>sensations as you may now imagine. O Heavens! said he, with your leave I must see her, my veneration for her is so great, that no consideration whatever can prevent my seeing her, when in my power. Well, said Negotio, your wishes shall be gratified, but if you have in consequence thereof any disagreeable sensations, you will be so good as to blame your own curiosity therefor, and acquit your friend. But however, I think it would be better for you not to think any more on the subject, but depart in peace. Parismas whose anxiety every moment aug∣mented in a geometrical proportion, replied, sir, urge that matter no further I beseech you—I am in torment—distracted, in the name of friendship, I conjure you delay me no longer. Friendship, reply'd Negotio forbids my gratifying you—I have such a regard for your peace of mind that I again warmly recommend to give over a design which cannot fail of putting your mind in such a state, as will be very remote from the smallest ideas of satisfaction. Parismas replied, the more you endeavour to dissuade me, the more anxious I am, and I do conjure you, by every principle of friendship, to hold me in this cruel suspence no longer, your dis∣course has raised my curiosity to such a pitch, that I am to be delay'd no longer. Well,
<PB N="9" REF="034307_0006_0FFD7E9799682298"/>said Negotio, you shall be gratified, follow me, so quitting the room, they passed a back parlour, on the back side of which, he unlocked a door, that introduced them into a long, narrow, dark and foul room, at the extreme part of which lay a corpse partly devoured, the sight of which, accom∣panied with the nauseous scent which it produced, filled poor Parismas with an hor∣ror unknown to him before. Negotio pro∣ceeded to unlock a door in the back side of this hideous department, from which issued the most wretched object that ever ter∣rified the eyes of mortals, it was the wife of Negotio, but what a dreadful, horific meta∣morphose! not a single trace was left of her former self; instead of those beautiful charms with which she was formerly posses∣sed, the most frightful visage that imagi∣nation can depict, presented itself—Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh emaciated loft her skin forming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinkles of the most gastly aspect, her eyes almost started from their sockets.</P>
<P>She discovered every evidence of the most extreme anguish, horror and dispair, her distorted looks were the emblem of rage and distress, scarcely containing any thing human, the whole decorated with a species of nastiness which served to make the spectacle still more horrid, while a hideous
<PB N="10" REF="034307_0007_0FFD7EA4E16DC510"/>grin compleated the doleful appearance of her face. Round which hung the dishevelled remains of that hair, which was once an ornament to her head.</P>
<P>No sooner had she entered the room, but regardless both of her husband and Paris∣mas, she ran with all the haste her enfeebled state of body would admit, to the place where lay the wasting corpse, which she fell to devouring with all the eagerness which hunger is capable of inspiring, tear∣ing the putrified flesh with her teeth from the bones. Negotio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>od holding his watch in his hand f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of three minutes, when he steped to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, took her by the hand, and forcibly dragged her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> door, and thrusting h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abode, turned the key, and confined he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while her cries for deliverance were suffi∣cient to have mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a heart of adamant. Parismas was nearly transfixed at the sight, at the same time so singular, so bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d and execrable, and it was with some degree of difficulty that Negotio could induce Pa∣rismas to remove back out of the doleful place. With blood full of horror he raised his astonished eyes upon Negotio, and in the accents of grief, cried, "For God's sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Negotio inform me the occasion of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sight, the idea of it congeals my creeping

Negat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eless manner, replied, "My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inconstant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> favourite died by my ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and his remai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are deposited in the long dark room, she is confined as you see, and three minutes in each day she is allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of his body, and as long as she can live in that situation she will live, and no longer; but you will ask me no more questions on this subject. Sir, I have gratified you curiosi∣ty, and I expect no more interrogato∣ries."</P>
<P>With a heart confounded with amazement, Parismas took leave of Negotio, repaired to his ship, scarcely realizing were he was, or what he was about. The dismal figure of the distressed lady, kept continually hovering before his terrified eyes, and the baleful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lea continually harrowing up every tender sensation of his distressed bosom; he ar∣rived at his cabin just as the sun began to emerge below the western horizon, he laid himself down, but could no more compose his mind, than a pennant can hang pendent in a tornado; about ten o'clock he started from his cabbin, called two trusty seamen, order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them to take twenty fathoms of small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and follow him—they obeyed —he rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to the house of Negotio, re∣solved to liberate the lady, or perish in the
<PB N="12" REF="034307_0008_0FFD7E9C937AC930"/>attempt:—He found means to ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the yard which encompassed the house, and by going to the back side, found, to the great joy of Parismas, that the back part of the building, in which was the unfortunate lady, was but one story high; and by the help of some old casks, which incommoded the yard, they ascended the roof where they found a chimney which came from the hor∣rid appartment of the lady. Parismas made the rope fast round his middle, and giving the end to the seamen, was by them let down into the room where she was confined, be reached the bottom, groped round in the dark, he at last stumbled over the wretched object of his research, he fell across her, and his head struck the floor, the noise of which, with the blow she received awoke her in a fright; a screech announced to Parismas that she was no longer in a sleep: He prevented her second outcry by saying, <Q>Dear lady, I am come to liberate you from this wretched place of confinement; submit yourself to my direction, and you shall once more enjoy that liberty, from which you are now debarred; ask me no question, but if you desire to gain your freedom, and once more be happy, let me make this rope fast around you.</Q> The lady lost in extacy,
<PB N="13" REF="034307_0008_0FFD7E9C937AC930"/>at such an unexpected event, could scarcely signify to her deliverer her consent to his proposal; but Parismas lost no time in loosing himself from the rope, and mak∣ing it fast about the lady, the seamen at a signal made by Parismas, drew her to the top of the chimney, where they cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rope from her, and then drew up Parismas.</P>
<P>With all the speed they were capable of, they descended to the ground, passed out of the yard, and the seamen taking up the lady, conveyed her safely on board of Parisma's ship, and deposited her safely in the captain's cabbin.</P>
<P>Parismas called all hands upon deck, they weighed anchor, hoisted fail, and having a favorable wind, a fair night, a full uncloud∣ed moon, in a few hours they lost sight of the light, which was erected on the outward point, which formed the harbour. Parismas then descended the cabbin, where, in amaze∣ment s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the lady, scarcely realizing but she was still in her doleful confinement.</P>
<P>As soon as Parismas descended, she recog∣nized his features, and knew him to be her favourite Parismas. "Heavens! exclaimed she, with hands and eyes uplifted—what do I see? where am I? Is it possible that I have escaped—escaped from a doleful place
<PB N="14" REF="034307_0009_0FFD7EC297335C90"/>of misery! have I got myself clear from the man, who with a heart harder than the nether mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, shut up every avenue of compassion, and with a cruelty which would have brought tears of blood from the even of a NER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, condemned a poor unfor∣tunate (though perfectly innocent) women, to a punishment which the worst of tyrants never thought of inflicting, on the most abandoned malefactors; who in a single mo∣ment transformed himself from the tenderest of husbands, into a fury, which language is not capable of bestowing a proper name on.</P>
<P>A flood of tears prevented her from pro∣ceeding, and before she could again ar∣ticulate, her strength fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led her, she swooned away, and to appearance was dead.</P>
<P>Every thing within the power of Paris∣mas was exerted to restore animation to her, and considerable time was expended, be∣fore an idea could be formed, whether she would ever recover from the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eless stare in which she then was involved; but at last, signs of recovery appeared, and by slow gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, she regained her senses.</P>
<P>Parismas then sat himself down by her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one half expressing joy and half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verwhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with gile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,—"Madam,
<PB N="15" REF="034307_0009_0FFD7EC297335C90"/>it is with the greatest sensations of pleasure when I reflect that I have been the happy in∣strument of delivering you from a situation, to which none of the human race were ever reduced: it is no part of my business to enquire what was the cause of that treat∣ment which I am sure you could not deserve. My regards for you were so great that I had rather have risked any thing than not have relieved you. You are now sat at liberty, I will convey you to England, where you shall be totally secure from your persecutor, and if providence makes it necessary, you shall want for nothing while I have any property left. I shall order that you have a suitable assortment of apparel brought you directly, together with suitable provision, for your disengaging yourself from every thing disagreeable about you."</P>
<P>By this time the cabin boy had provided some suitable nourishment for her, which she with due caution swallowed, and then proceeded to divest herself of her prison apparel, and decked herself in a sumptuous atti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement, which Parismas had prepared for her.</P>
<P>After she had washed herself, &amp;c. Paris∣mas's barber dressed her head, and she once more was ornamented with Jewels, diamonds and rings, and discovered many of those
<PB N="16" REF="034307_0010_0FFD7EA1F73D1148"/>charms which formerly shone in full lustre in her countenance, and appeared once more in many respects to be an object of admiration.</P>
<P>In the evening, Parismas coming into the cabin, took a seat by the lady, whose aspect by this time had recovered much of its native serenity, with a look full of gratitude, she cast her eyes on her deliverer, and with as much complisance as her state would admit of, thus addressed him, "Most dear and benevolent sir," it will be forever beyond the reach of my ability to make you any kind of satisfaction, for the inesti∣mable favor you have done me, and the strongest language is infinitely too feeble to express the sensations of gratitude, which oc∣cupy my sick heaving bosom: All I can say, is, that all I have, together with my∣self, I now dedicate to you, and your service, dispose of me as you think proper; I am willing—more than willing—I wish to be your bond slave while I have a breath to draw. But, if being your slave is too great a favor to grant (which I allow is the case) dispose of, and fell me for life, to whom you see fit. She ended, and Parismas ob∣served a silent tear stealing involuntarily down her cheek, and he fancied he saw something struggling in her bosom, which her greatest
<PB N="17" REF="034307_0010_0FFD7EA1F73D1148"/>exertions could not wholly conceal: he stood silent a few moments to observe the conflict, he then broke silence, and said, "fair lady, I conjure you, to smother in your breast no longer, what you wish to reveal; your happy situation is so extraor∣dinary, that my impatience tortures me to know what those ideas or reflections are, which so agitate your heaving bosom." Dear sir, replied the lady, it is no easy or pleasant piece of business to relate to you, the cause of my misfortune, which I know myself only by conjecture—Nineteen days ago, my husband and myself rose in the morning as usual, we sat down at the table, drank our chocolate, and I imagined that an unusual pleasantness was seated in his countenance, and good nature in his breast, we chatted away an hour at table, in the most agreeable manner, he then arose, gave me a kind salute, and with a look of mild∣ness, left me, and repaired to the yard, at the back of the house, where some affairs de∣manded his presence. I heard no more of him, for some time. I waited for his return with impatience for about three hours, at which time, I heard a severe blow in the back room, watch was succeeded by two or three of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tterest groans which ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed my as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shed heart.

Say∣ing this, he with violence seized me, and draged me to the door.</P>
<P>Fruitless were all my entreaties for him to explain my crime to me, and the most solemn declarations that I would evince my innocence if he would admit me to an opportunity therefor—He made me no answer but went off in a rage.</P>
<P>In that situation I remained until Heaven sent you to deliver me. This dear sir, is all that I know of the matter, and I am totally ignorant of what strange fatality gave rise to the passion of jealousy, which it appear∣ed to me was the dictator of his conduct.</P>
<P>Parismas listened with the most perfound attention to the Lady's narration, while the trickling tear stole down his cheek, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g sign could not be prevented from forcing itself from his bosom; after con∣soling the Lady, he ordered a tankard of wine to be brought on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, with which having refreshed themselves, and business calling Parismas on the deck, he left her in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to her own reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="034307_0012_0FFD7E9002B4A850"/>
When he returned, he entered into a very familiar discourse on her situation, enquiring if she had no idea of any cir∣cumstance, which might give rise to those suspicions in her husband's breast, which induced him to that conduct, in her ans∣wer she informed him she was totally ignorant of any thing more than she had told him in her relation before, and her sincerity appeared to be such, as gave Parismas no reason to doubt of her veracity.</P>
<P>Parismas continued to conduct himself towards her with all possible politeness, and with particular care, and saw that she wanted for nothing that could conduce to her wel∣fare, and notwithstanding the dreadful situa∣tion she was in, before they reached Eng∣land she had perfectly recovered whatever she had lost by the barbarous treatment of her husband; brightness again sparkled with additional brilliancy in her eyes, the rose again bloomed in her cheeks, her skin re∣assumed its fairness, and she was once more an object which could not be beheld without admiration.</P>
<P>One evening as they sat together in the cabin, after some agreeable discourse, he interrogated her whether she considered her∣self under any kind of obligation to her
<PB N="22" REF="034307_0013_0FFD7EB5DB6D7430"/>husband or not, on account of the mar∣riage covenant between them.</P>
<P>The Lady replied, that notwithstanding the solemnity of marriage contracts, and the great attention with which he had always treated her until the late unheard of transaction, that though, till that time no woman was ever blessed with a better, kinder, or more loving husband, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et she had not the least doubt, but that such an open and unprovoked violation of the marriage covenant, must in the nature of things, totally absolve her from every degree of obligation which she laid herself under, when she entered thereinto. Parismas then infor∣med her, if she considered herself at her own disposal, and had no objections for exchanging a single life, for a matrimonial one, if her late treatment had not discour∣aged her from again trusting her person in the hands of one of that sex who had misus∣ed her, he would make an offer of his per∣son to her, and that, if it was agreeable to her, on their arrival at England, they would join their hands at the altar of Hymen.</P>
<P>The lady, with looks tool of astonishment and sweetness, in accents which discovered the fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rise of her mind, replied, Is it possi∣ble that a person of your nobleness of mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of education, should descend to
<PB N="23" REF="034307_0013_0FFD7EB5DB6D7430"/>insult the most unfortunate woman in the world; for it is impossible you should be in earnest.—You, sir, could never brook the idea of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooping to marry a person in my forlorn and distressed circumstances; you will therefore, excuse me, if I view your proposal as a piece of banter, which had better not have escaped from your lips. Most admirable goddess of sincere adora∣tion, replied Parismas, you injure me when you suppose I have a tongue which is cap∣able of speaking a language foreign from my heart; dissimulation forms no part of my character, and I can easily acquit you of believing the suggestion which you have manifested, I only conceive that my pro∣posal does not meet your approbation, and that you have made choice of this genteel method of signifying your disinclination to comply therewith; but a person whose heart is undergoing those torments, which now take full possession of my wretched bosom, is not to be put off by irony or any oblique pretence. I must have my doom categori∣cally pronounced by your lips before I give up the object, which is the great pole star of my affections, so you will proceed to declare me the happiest of mortals, or the most miserable of any of the human species, according as you wish well or ill. The
<PB N="24" REF="034307_0014_0FFD7EA8CB69FB58"/>lady stood stedfastly looking on his face, till she could read sincerity in every feature in his anx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous countenance, when in accents of rapture she exclaimed, "O! Heavens! is it possible, that the man whom, since first I saw him, I prized above mortals, and whose benevolence has snatched me from the most loathsome, distressing and perishing condition, has notwithstanding all my mis∣fortunes, vouchsafed to offer me the nuptial hand! Dear Sir, I am wholly at your dis∣posal—I wish to spend the remainder of life in the service of that man who has sav∣ed my life, but as to having you for a husband, it would have been an idea I never should have dared to entertain in the most eligible part of my life; so at this time of my dejection and disgrace: the regard I have for you forbids every idea of so far imposing on you as to form that con∣nection with you which you request.</P>
<P>Parismas now found use for all his reas∣oning powers, in offering her arguments and entreaties to rescind that resolution which she had formed and which she was obstinately determined r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to alter; how∣ever, after days spent for that purpose, she was prevailed on to give her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, by giving him her hand in massage, when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at England.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="034307_0014_0FFD7EA8CB69FB58"/>
Parsimas now thought himself the hap∣piest and most enviable person ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting; and nothing was to be seen in his cabin but joy and festivity; but a horrid storm arising, drove them one night on a sandy beach, near a small port town, where their ship received a considerable damage, which took considerable time to be repaired.</P>
<P>After having sufficiently repaired their vessel, they again put to sea, and were favoured with a pleasant passage, and the tedious days rolled away, and im∣perceptibly shortened the time, necessary to transpire before they could reach the long-wished for British shore; at last ar∣riving in the neighbourhood of the Cape de Verd Islands, where there hove in sight a British privateer, which had been con∣structed on a merchant ship, and was of nearly the size of the ship in which Parismas was.</P>
<P>Parismas was overjoyed at seeing a ship; belonging to his own country: a sight he had not before beheld for many months, he bore down to her in order to speak with her, hoping to have some intelligence from his country and friends; he spoke with her, found she was a privateer from Bristol. Of her he first learned that a war had then

<PB N="27" REF="034307_0015_0FFD7EC9D9B0A130"/>to the ship, who was taken up badly wounded, and whose life was now despair∣ed of; that gentleman was an Englishman, and said he belonged in Canton, and that he was pursuing an English vessel, which had plundered him of a considerable pro∣perty, and which he had mistaken the privateer for.</P>
<P>Parismas hearing this, desired to see his unfortunate countryman, on which the Cap∣tain gave orders that he should be taken up carefully in a blanket and brought in∣to the cabin, which was done accordingly; but what was the astonishment of Paris∣mas and the lady, when in their poor un∣fortunate countryman, they found Negotio, the husband of the lady! They both stood in silent wonder, gazing on the poor un∣fortunate man; while distressed Negotio's eyes, recognised both their visages; while his countenance expressed grief, anger malice, chagrin and shame by turns; a space ensued, when no ideas were com∣municated, but by their expressive coun∣tenances; at length, Parismas broke silence and thus addressed him—Sir, I am at a loss for words to communicate to you the vari∣ous, transitions of lensatiens with which my mind is exercised towards you—your case is truly pitiful, as well as to all ap∣pearance,
<PB N="28" REF="034307_0016_0FFD7EADE16EB740"/>remediless—pity, grief, amaze∣ment, horror, resentment, all occupy at the same time my tempestuous bosom, and which of these passions will break out the most furious, I can form no conjecture of; however, I feel a kind of strange satisfac∣tion in seeing you, though my sensations on the occasion are very far from being in any sense agreeable.</P>
<P>Negotio pale and wan with the loss of blood, and weakened by pain, chagrin, and reflexion of such a change of circumstances, rolled his eyes round, and begged as a dying man that the cabin might be left a∣lone to him, Parismas, and the lady, as he wished a dying conferrence with them: this was granted, and as soon as the cab∣in was in their sole possession, the lady thus addressed him: "as you are a dying man, just entering on the eternal world, I demand of you a full explanation of your barbarous and cruel treatment of me the last seventeen days I was in Canton; your recollection will furnish you with ideas, which, I wish not to be pained by mentioning, if it is in your power to satisfy the greatest object of injured innocence, I wish you would do it before those eyes which I formerly beheld with raptures, though now with very differ∣ent
<PB N="29" REF="034307_0016_0FFD7EADE16EB740"/>sensations, are closed in eternal night.</P>
<P>Negotio replied with a faul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing voice, I will satisfy your curiosity, never was the heart of a man so fully wrapt up in the 'complacency of a woman, as mine in you, till fatal jealousy, a foible of my soul, terminated the short-connection—my most tranquil hours were disturbed by some dire∣ful foreboding, that some favourite would be my rival, though I artfully concealed those bitter goadings from the perception of any one—but after we had breakfasted together the last time, and I had repaired to the yard to attend on some business there, an intimate friend and neighbour came up, and I discovered discontent, sat lowering on his countanence, and after the usual complements of meeting, he said, I have something which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es with the greatest weight on my mind, and the respect I have for your character, forbids my any l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ger concealing it from you—I must give you this information, I shall then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave done my duty, and you may conduct your self in such a way on the occasion as your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/>on shall dict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.—Your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is notoriously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ue to your be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y of a violation of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge contract the forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o

<P>Your servant Fidelio is the favourite, and he has twice since you have been in this yard violated your bed.

<P>At length, he recovered, and thus went on, "After you had by some means effec∣ted an escape, I fell in company with this same intimate, who had been absent from town from the time of giving the fatal in∣formation, till then: to whom I related the whole of the adventure; I read the great∣est perplexity of mind in his visage, while I was repeating the shameful and inhuman part I had acted; at the close of which, he fell on his knees, and said, "forgive me! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>R GOD'S SAKE, forgive me!" Affronted at a smart repartee, I received from your lady, in company a few evenings before, in which I thought she was too pointed, and that her observation was too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sely con∣nected w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th facts, and the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sfaction which I perceived, or fancied the company took on the mortification w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> it was out of, my power to prevent them from witnessing

My invention suggested the false and groundless report which I made to you, as I passed by to go out of town.</P>
<P>Thunderstruck with the unexpected con∣fession of this incendiary, I was in a suspen∣sion of rationality; I drew my sword, and at one stroke reduced him to a lifeless corpse.</P>
<P>With all the speed which I was master of I fitted out a vessel, for the purpose of re∣covering my cruelly injured wife; whom, I took it for granted, you Parismas had found means to liberate, and had carried off with you: and the idea I had of her charms forbid my having any hopes of your de∣livering her to me, unless compelled by force: I therefore made preparation accord∣ingly; I sat sail, prosecuted my voyage, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll I fell in with the, ship, on board of which we now are: this I took to be your ship; I accordingly began a fierce attack, on her, the issue of which was the sinking of my ship, and being left afloat, mortally wounded; I was taken on board in a cour∣teous manner, and have experienced every attention which my situation is capable of admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="034307_0020_0FFD7EB395B4A018"/>and sprightly young gentleman of about twenty-one, dressed in a manner the most genteel, and whose aspect bespoke some∣thing great in his soul. Her father's eyes began to kindle into rage at a sight which his imagination suggested to him was omnious of no good. His daughter's percep∣tion informed her of the sensations which occupied the indignant breast of her fa∣ther; she thus accosted him.—"Dear, honoured, and beloved father, I humbly ask your paternal pardon for thus interrup∣ting your contemplations, but a matter of the greatest consequence made it my duty.

<P>I have at last had an opportunity to in∣form him of my passion for him, which I did in the most engaging manner I was capable of; and though a novice in the art of wooing, yet such was my pathos, that it fully convinced him that nothing but the purest s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsations of uncontaminated affec∣tion 01 was the cause of the over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies I made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; when I had made an end of my ad∣dress to him, the rose bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, while in accents the
<PB N="5" REF="034307_0021_0FFD7E9486417C78"/>most engaging, he vainly endeavoured to persuade me to give over what he was pleased to call so improper and unsuitable a pursuit, telling me that I was heiress to one of the most wealthy and consequen∣tial characters in the kingdom; and was qualified to grace the bed of a monarch; that he himself was a most obscure char∣acter; that his birth and parentage were totally unknown even to himself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; that when an infant he was taken out of a box tossing amidst the surf which beat on our shore, that he had been brought up by the hospitable charity of a gentleman, and that he had no means of supporting himself, except by the charity of his benefactor, and the education which he had given him, that such a difference of quality totally dis∣qualified for a conjugal connection, but that part from those considerations, the want of my father's approbation would be an insurmountable obstruction thereto, and therefore desired and begged of me to ba∣nish every idea of him from my mind.</P>
<P>Of little consequence was this harangue; I still continued importunate to the last de∣gree, nor would I suffer him to leave me, till he had promised at a certain time and place to meet me again on the subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus ended our first interview, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch

<P>Her father who could scarcely contain
<PB N="7" REF="034307_0022_0FFD7EAC1038B9A8"/>himself while she was addressing him: as soon as she had ended, broke out in the most bit∣ter invectives against the young man, and the most severe reprehensions to his daughter for her criminal overtures she had made him, and in the end by the ringing of a bell called in a number of servants, when he or∣dered them to take the young man and convey him on board of a vessel lying in the harbour, then immediately bound on a voyage to sea, which command was in∣stantly obeyed, while the poor Rosilla, lay senseless in a swoon; at the first time seeing her father disapprove of her conduct, and at the loss of him who was dearer to her th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n life itself.</P>
<P>Every effort was made use of to restore her to her senses, which at last proved ef∣fectual, but the most apparent dejection was seated on her countenance, and in vain was every method used to erase from her mind the memory of him; to no purpose, was she informed of the King's intention towards her, the gaudy tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pings of royalty had no allurements in them that could induce her to withdraw her affections from the young man, whom she looked on as the ornament and glory of human na∣ture.</P>
<P>For a week she remained in an incon∣solable
<PB N="8" REF="034307_0023_0FFD7E8A97DD7388"/>state, when her invention suggested to her a probability of once more meeting with her admired Alcander, (for that was his name) and she immediately formed a resolution of putting the scheme in execution. In order to effect which, she procured a suit of Seaman's apparel, with which she attired herself. With this habit she entered on board a vessel as a common Seaman, hoping by this means to meet with him whom she prized more than all the riches in the world.</P>
<P>It is foreign from my present design, to give a particular detail of what the poor Rosilla passed through on board of the vessel under the name of Evander, and of what hardships she experienced in a long and fruitless search after her beloved Alcan∣der, suffice it to say, that she acquited her∣self so honourably, that she became the second commander in the vessel on the death of her predecessor, in which station she possessed the highest degree of the confidence of all who were on board the vessel, but what amazement and horror seized not only Rosilla, but the Captain, and the whole crew; one fair and pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sant morning, when they espyed a vessel but a small distance from them, having a piratical flag hois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> head; to attempt an escape

In this confused situation they held a consultation, the result of which was, to make as good a defence as they could, and knowing that fortune favours the brave; they rested only on this ground, that there was a possibility of avoiding being captured by this merciless pirate.</P>
<P>By the time this was agreed on, the ship was along side of them, when a furi∣ous attack was begun by the pirate, and an obstinate defence by the other. Per∣haps never was more valour discovered than by this little band of heroes; 'till at length being overpowered, their Captain slain, and above half their men killed and wounded, they were boarded by the ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣lants, on which a complete victory soon ensued.</P>
<P>The Prisoners were indiscriminately hur∣ried on board of the Pirate, and huddled in below the deck, while the captors were busily employed in plundering their new acquired booty. This business being end∣ed, said the Lieutenant to the Captain, it is time a council should set to determine the fate of those sturdy prisoners who have
<PB N="10" REF="034307_0024_0FFD7E8C23CA1048"/>put us to so much cost of time, pains and blood, to conquer them, not less than one third of their crew being either killed or wounded, those miscreants ought to be sa∣crificed to appease the manes, of our fallen brethren, and to elevate the pains of those who are suffering under their wounds; what say you Captain?</P>
<P>You are quite right answered the bloody disposed Captain) but I am so exhausted with fatigue, and the loss of blood, by a large (though not mortal) wound, that I must substitute you, and place you on the tribunal of retribution, and your determina∣tion shall be fate. Every thing being pre∣pared, the lieutenant took the seat of judg∣ment, and ordered the prisoners to be brought out, one by one, safely ironed. The first whose fate it was to be arraigned. was the tender and delicate Evander, bound in setters, and brought before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch of justice, where the sole arbitor of life and death, with a countenance, frown∣ing v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngance, and eyes sparkling rage, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rendered the most hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fie, he thus addressed the prisoner, "poor pitiful mis∣creant, you have obstinately refused to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to our re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the seas, and put us to much trouble and hazard, and de∣prived us of a considerable number of our
<PB N="11" REF="034307_0024_0FFD7E8C23CA1048"/>best men, in consequence of which it has become our incumbent duty to make ex∣amples of you, especially of your person, as you had the chief command devolved on you after the death of your superior, therfore hold up your guilty head and hear your sentence, for by the infernal Gods, within half an hour you shall be wrapt in sheets of liquid sulphur, impregnated with fire: for you in the first place shall be made fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the deck, with your face upwards, your mouth extended with a gag in each corner, of an inch thickness, and two quarts of lead melted and mixed sulphur, shall be poured down your throat, and if this is not sufficient to satiate your appe∣tite, the dose shall be doubled, and my im∣patience is such, that each moment is an age, till I see this decree carried into effect. The terrified Rosilla, under the name of Evander, raised her distracted eyes to her judge: but what was her sensations, when in the person of him who had pronounced this awful sentence against her, she discov∣ered her long sought for Alcander! The colour in her face alternately changed from red to paleness, and from paleness to the vivid colour of the rose, and the highest degree of confusion, was legible in her countenance, her different emotions of
<PB N="12" REF="034307_0025_0FFD7EBA90C35DD8"/>mind for some time divested her of the power of utterance; at last she collected her scattering ideas, and thus addressed the Judge. "Dear sir, it is enough—I have seen you once more—You have give the most bloody sentence which the compass of human ideas is capable of forming against your best friend, against one who loved you better than every other earthly enjoyment—against one who dispised a diadem and a septre, for the affection she had for you, against o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who has left every thing near and dear for the hopes of finding you—You have given sentence against one who might have remained possessed of every human tranquillity, had it not have been for the love of you; thousands were an∣nually at my command, put I have left every thing for your sake, and this is the benediction you bestow on the therefor—Here sir, is the <HI>ring</HI> you once gave me, as a pledge of your in violable love to me—You must remember that happiest of mo∣ments, when you bestowed this on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you called your adoreable Rosilla—pray sir then, from whenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comes this strange alteration.</P>
<P>Alcander stood in a maze 'till he heard her mention the name of "Rosilla" at the naming of which, he burst into a stood of
<PB N="13" REF="034307_0025_0FFD7EBA90C35DD8"/>tears—and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiting his seat, clasped her in his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>aced her in extacy—excla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, yes! e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>my Dear Rosilla <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I recollect!

<P>The spectators stood astonished at this transaction, and notwithstanding, their piratical dispositions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed pleased at the occurence, till the Captain interrupted the ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing sensations they enjoyed, by address∣ing the Judge in the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er—Pray sir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a true l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you had not given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

"Vile Repd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>! thou pretend to be a man?—Thou think to be esteemed not only worthy the human shape, but also to be capable of enterpr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze, and to put on the name of soldier, and inlist under the ban∣ner of Mars, and to cross the Ocean in search of adventures, and at the same time, to have thy femenine heart melted down by a whimpering woman's tears?

<P>Alcander was struck with horror at this infernal mandate; but being sensible of his situation, and knowing that his life depend∣ed on a momentary exertion, he drew his sword, and with one push, pierced the heart of this insuperably cruel Captain, who with a hedious yell gave up the ghost, and whose body was instantly committed to the deep, for food to the revenous uncouth animals which inhabit the caverns there∣of.</P>

Alcander now being the sole commander, directed his course for the famed Isle of Britain, enjoying his incomparable lady, whom he cauled to be decked in the rich∣est of woman's attire, and Neptune favour∣ing there purpose, soon introduced them into the harbour from which he at first sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, when he was forced away by her remorseless father; but unhappily for them, the vessel they were in was no sooner in port, than she was known; and poor Alcander was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken into custody as a pirate, together with the crew, (Rosilla ex∣cepted, who was kept as a witness)</P>
<P>Alcander soon underwent a trial, and received sentence of death, and his death warrant was instantly made out, in order that it might be put in execution the next day, when he was taken out of the dun∣geon, with all the awful formalities of exe∣cution.</P>
<P>He was carried to the fatal spot, where, in the most finished agony, he was just go∣ing to make his ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; Rosilla, who was dismissed the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y before, came up and demanded a release of the Prisoner; for said she, "There is a law in the kingdom of Kent, from before the memory of man to the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rary, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any man, sen∣tenced b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngdom to death

The officers of justice who attended on the execution, on hearing this, ordered that he be taken from the stage erected for his execution, and married as the law directs—which was done accordingly, and Alcander set at liber∣ty.</P>
<P>Having taken lodgings at an inn for a few days, they made preparations for repairing to her father's reasonably sup∣posing that the old gentleman would not fail of properly rewarding any one, who should be the introducer of his daughter to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of two days brought them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; they entered his house, where, falling on their knees, they informed him of the whole of their history, and concluded by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>y, and in tears asking his blessing.</P>
<P>The father could scarcely contain him∣self while they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> askin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his blessing, and no sooner had they finished they petition
<PB N="18" REF="034307_0028_0FFD7E9F8A13CDB0"/>for his benediction, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the old man knit∣ting his brows, with a countenance full of wrath, thus uttered himself—"Shall it be said that my daughter, the heir to my im∣mense fortune, has for a husband a Pitate, one that has been condemned to a gibbet! No! no! this never shall be endured—I'll see him safely imprisoned, and there he shall spend the remainder of his days in close confinement."—Dear father (replied Rosilla) whatever offence has been commit∣ed, was done by me, and me alone; my dear Alcander is entirely innocent—in justice therefore he should not be a sufferer—Whatever revenge you think it proper to be inflicted, let it fall on me only, and let my husband be clear—her father in stern accents replied, do you think Madam, you are so well able to bear the weight of mine anger? I will assure you, you shall have as much of it as you are able to bear, to the extent, and he shall have the rest—I shall shut compassion from my breast, and pity from my heart, and my eye shall not spare the objects of my displeasure—hav∣ing said this, he sent him well guarded to a prison, and her he confined to a dark chamber, there to spend the disconsolate hours in heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending anguish—in which situation they kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her until the time of

<PB N="20" REF="034307_0029_0FFD7E91B854AF50"/>consent to marry, you shall be received to my favour, and shall be made as happy as the enjoyments of life can render you.</P>
<P>"Dear father, (replied the disconsolate lady) how long will you continue to add to my distresses, which are altogether in∣tolerable already.—I have been married two years to him who has full possession of my effections—I can never love another—'tis in vain to urge it upon me, for none in this world shall ever enjoy me besides my inestimable Alcander—my body is in your power—you will dispose of it as you think proper, but my soul is free from your disposal, and let you inflict what you will upon me, it will never induce me to prove false to the man whom I esteem preserable to all others.</P>
<P>Her father, on hearing this, retired from her; finding it was in vain to make any further attemps to induce her to break her resolution, sent to the prison, and fetched away Alcander, dressed him in the most ele∣gant attire; caused his daughter to meet him in his parlour, in all the decorations which dress was capable of ornamenting her with; recognized her marriage—presented her son to her embraces, and joy and gladness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more filled the hearts of Alcander and
