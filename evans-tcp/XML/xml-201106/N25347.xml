<HEAD>A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LONG have I sought, beset with grievous toil,</L>
<L>To gain AMERICA'S applauded soil,</L>
<L>To fly a Land oppress'd with bleeding woes</L>
<L>That savage war and tumult only knows;</L>
<L>To feel no more Corruption's growing force,</L>
<L>Of griefs the spring, my Country's baneful curse;</L>
<L>To see no more the pageantry of state,</L>
<L>That kings command and princes can create:</L>
<L>Nor view the potentate with haughty nod,</L>
<L>Exact an homage due alone to GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Joyful I press the ground with FREEDOM blest,</L>
<L>Where FRANKLIN liv'd with self-emblazen'd crest,</L>
<L>Where WASHINGTON his grateful Country brought</L>
<L>Calm Independance, Liberty of thought;</L>
<L>Snucck the stern sceptre from the Tyant's hand,</L>
<L>And bliss restor'd to all his native Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Country once in Natures rudest state,</L>
<L>Where no fine feeling did the breast elate,</L>
<L>Where Wedlock's laws no human being blest,</L>
<L>But babes unfather'd hung upon the breast;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="033609_0003_0FF7A83AE0DE69D8"/>
Where War destructive ravag'd ev'ry plain,</L>
<L>And parent by the child was often slain;</L>
<L>This Country now another aspect wears,</L>
<L>Each gentler virtue now its bosom shares.</L>
<L>Here comely Peace, the nymph of placid mien,</L>
<L>With smiling visage gladdens ev'ry scene:</L>
<L>War's brazen trump no more is heard to sound,</L>
<L>No panting coursers shake th'embattled ground,</L>
<L>But Commerce catching each auspicious gale,</L>
<L>To ev'ry sky unfurls the swelling sail.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This was written in March.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Survey this Country, view its blessings o'er,</L>
<L>Who would not court its hospitable shore?</L>
<L>Here Independance holds her smiling reign,</L>
<L>Of laws despotic none can here complain:</L>
<L>Freedom, the birth-right of the human soul,</L>
<L>None here dispute, and none would here controul:</L>
<L>But all a common friend to Freedom's cause,</L>
<L>From Freedom's source derive their noble laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be ever sacred that eventful hour</L>
<L>When fir'd with England's vile abuse of pow'r,</L>
<L>The peaceful Colonists indignant rose,</L>
<L>To meet oppression and her yoke oppose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For justice struggling, and for human right,</L>
<L>How many sunk to everlasting night:</L>
<L>Fell, bravely fell, deplor'd by ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>From ev'ry breast eliciting the sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where Quebec's rocks with tow'ring summits rise,</L>
<L>And proudly soaring point towards the skies,</L>
<L>MONTGOMERY, the leader of his train,</L>
<L>Crown'd with the laurel, at the siege was slain.</L>
<L>In that sad hour each heart with sorrow bled,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Muse dejected hung her head.</L>
<L>Thalia mournful, threw her mask away,</L>
<L>Beat her bare breast, and wept the live-long day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="033609_0004_0FF7A83C81CB26F8"/>
<L>But yet, lamented shade, the Muse shall save</L>
<L>Thy shining virtues from the clay-cold grave:</L>
<L>Throughout the world where Freedom souths to rest,</L>
<L>Where love of Liberty exalts the breast,</L>
<L>The fame shall live, thy deeds shall grace the page</L>
<L>Of rising poets in some future age;</L>
<L>Ev'n lisping babes be taught thy name to sound,</L>
<L>Their infant hearts exulting with a bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But turn, O Muse, where rural scenes invite,</L>
<L>Where Nature's charms can ev'ry eye delight.</L>
<L>Lo! Philadelphia rising from the main.</L>
<L>With Sylvan beauties cheers the happy swain.</L>
<L>The Delaware with ample channel laves</L>
<L>The flow'ry banks that court its silver waves:</L>
<L>Ships from all empires on its bosom roll,</L>
<L>And waft their riches from the furthest pole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The busy trader hails the cheerful day</L>
<L>That safe conducts the vessel to its bay;</L>
<L>With joyful heart beholds the bark draw near,</L>
<L>At length releas'd from ev'ry painful fear.</L>
<L>The vessel o'er the surface lightly glides,</L>
<L>The rising keel the foaming surge divides;</L>
<L>The cordage cracks, the sails exulting swell,</L>
<L>The waving banner strives its joy to tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, here, O Muse, in pity drop the tear</L>
<L>O'er the dead body, o'er the untimely bier:</L>
<L>To parent, kindred, tune thy plaintive strains,</L>
<L>That felt the Pestilence consume their veins:</L>
<L>Their loss deplore, and raise the pensive sigh</L>
<L>For those who mourn with sorrow streaming eye,</L>
<L>A Father, child, a brother or a friend,</L>
<L>That healing pity once themselves could lend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If o'er this scene a retrospect we take,</L>
<L>How ev'ry object sorrow doth awake.</L>
<L>Here in the solemn stillness of the night,</L>
<L>The bleeding heart wept o'er the chilling sight</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="033609_0005_0FF7A83F04795AF0"/>
Of victims seiz'd with pestilential blast,</L>
<L>In painful anguish breathing out their last:</L>
<L>In each sad street was heard the dying moan,</L>
<L>And ev'ry gale came loaded with a groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here widows weeping o'er their husbands' bier.</L>
<L>With looks distracted drop the briny tear,</L>
<L>Or rend the air with pity moving strains,</L>
<L>That echo from the walls, the hills, the neigb'ring plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There tender mothers act the parent's part,</L>
<L>And mourn their offspring with a bursting heart,</L>
<L>While friendless orphans in the streets are found</L>
<L>That view their parents lifeless on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad was the scene, dejecting was the sight</L>
<L>Of bodies carry'd by the moon's pale light,</L>
<L>To where the church-yard's satiated cave</L>
<L>At ev'ry part display'd the new-made grave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But turn, O Muse, from scenes of woe and grief,</L>
<L>To themes congenial fly thee for relief.</L>
<L>Soon as the Spring, at Nature's just command,</L>
<L>Her visit pays to this delightful land,</L>
<L>The conscious swain partakes the genial pow'r,</L>
<L>Basks in the breeze, or curls the vernal flow'r.</L>
<L>Each comely Grace to Music's silver sound,</L>
<L>Leads up the dance, and lightly beats the ground;</L>
<L>Then laugh the vales, the woods their tribute bring,</L>
<L>And to the gales their balmy odours fling.</L>
<L>The crystal stream with softer murmur flows,</L>
<L>And sweetly whispers to the breeze that blows;</L>
<L>The ox no more demands his wonted stall,</L>
<L>But courts the mead, and distant water fall:</L>
<L>The snowy flocks abroad for pasture range,</L>
<L>The joyful shepherd glories in the change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when the Summer's blushing tints appear,</L>
<L>To deck with flow'rs and fruits the ripen'd year,</L>
<L>When golden harvests crown each fertile field.</L>
<L>And bending boughs their rosy produce yield,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="033609_0006_0FF7A8428A6890E8"/>
When through the meads the mazy rivers stray,</L>
<L>And dancing sun-beams on the water play,</L>
<L>The husbandman beholds with grateful eye,</L>
<L>His yellow corn fields smile beneath the sky,</L>
<L>Begins the labour, and with careful hand,</L>
<L>Reaps the blest produce of his fruitful land;</L>
<L>The rustic nymphs and swains in busy throng,</L>
<L>Solace their labours with the woodland song:</L>
<L>Thus through the day the circling hours roll,</L>
<L>And night rewards them with the flowing bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If bards delight in streams and shady grove,</L>
<L>If near the stream the Muse delights to rove,</L>
<L>This smiling land with ev'ry charm is blest,</L>
<L>Its streams yield pleasure, and its bowers rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Bay of Chesapeak its source divides,</L>
<L>And to the West pours out its ample tides,</L>
<L>To where Potowmack curls its silver waves,</L>
<L>And Alexandria's lofty structure laves.</L>
<L>The smiling vessels dancing on the flood,</L>
<L>Of ev'ry clime bring home the native good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Schuyskill river fertile in its views,</L>
<L>With scenes romantic charms the rural Muse.</L>
<L>That loves to pluck the flowret from its sides,</L>
<L>Through which the stream with wave translucent glides,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Susquehannah now invites my lay,</L>
<L>Beneath huge mountains pouring forth its way.</L>
<L>Its fragrant banks a fruitful valley shades,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with woods and wild luxuriant glades:</L>
<L>The rural hamlet, where its arms divide,</L>
<L>Enchants the view, and courts the purple tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any form of government be known,</L>
<L>In which the seeds of equity are sown,</L>
<L>To common-wealths it surely is confin'd,</L>
<L>A form that suits the dictates of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, when force and strength prevail'd,</L>
<L>The weaker by the strong became assail'd,</L>
<L>Till pow'r usurp'd a calm obedience found,</L>
<L>And human rights were trampled on the ground.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="033609_0007_0FF7A844457F0B20"/>
Then kings arose with stern and haughty brow,</L>
<L>To wrest submission from the croud below,</L>
<L>Who having once obey'd the stern decree,</L>
<L>Approach'd the throne, and bent the suppliant knee.</L>
<L>Oppression then a ready sanction found,</L>
<L>And cast her iron sceptre on the ground,</L>
<L>Now growing embers kindled into flame,</L>
<L>And what the father was the son became:</L>
<L>Hence sprang a race of pow'r supreme possest,</L>
<L>And monarchs, princes, nobles stood confest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But since mankind grown bold in Freedom's cause</L>
<L>Have caught the love of self-created laws,</L>
<L>Nations the yoke of slav'ry have o'erthrown,</L>
<L>And regal pow'r with triumph now disown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This rising land, though yet an infant state,</L>
<L>Enjoys the blessings that on empires wait,</L>
<L>Can boast of souls exalted as the earth,</L>
<L>That calls them sons, and smil'd upon their birth;</L>
<L>Of men made warriors in their country's cause,</L>
<L>Zealous to frame, and then obey its laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See honour'd WASHINGTON, with lofty soul,</L>
<L>Of manners gentle, yet above controul,</L>
<L>Whole armies conquer. Independance find,</L>
<L>The smiling emblem of his noble mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Declare, O Muse, how Caesar wild with pow'r,</L>
<L>To ruin hurl'd in some well destin'd hour,</L>
<L>Say how doth he who came to AFRIC'S shore,</L>
<L>Wept when he found no blood he could spill more,</L>
<L>Of LETHE'S stream the dark oblivion share,</L>
<L>When we to WASHINGTON'S their deeds compare,</L>
<L>Who having once with just and mighty arm,</L>
<L>Found means his foes of terror to disarm,</L>
<L>Retir'd like CINCINNATUS to his farm.</L>
<L>May then these acts that warm the generous heart,</L>
<L>To times remote their influence impart,</L>
<L>Grace the soft song, adorn th' historic page,</L>
<L>And call forth Heroes in each future age.</L>
