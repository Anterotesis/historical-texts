<HEAD>SCENE I.—<HI>A Grove.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FATHER PHILIP <HI>and</HI> MOTLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>NEVER tell me!—I repeat it, you are a fel∣low of a very scandalous course of life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I repeat it, I'm a perfect image of the purest virtue, compared to whom, for sobriety and continence, Ca∣to was a drunkard, and Lucretia little better than she should be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! hardened in impudence!—Can you deny being a pilferer, a liar, a glutton—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I?—Heaven be thanked, I've courage enough to deny any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doesn't all the world cry out upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies; and, in common with many other great men, my virtue at present labours under something of a cloud. But understand me right, Father: Though I don't assent to the sum-total of your accusations, possibly I may acknowledge some of the items; the best actions frequently appear culpa∣ble, merely because their motives are unexplained. There∣fore produce your charges, let me justify my conduct, and I doubt not I shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new sheet of foolscap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To begin then with your pilfering—did you, or did you not, break open the pantry-door, and steal out the great goose-pye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whose then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="034000_0004_0FF9FB8D740F0E90"/>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook's, undoubtedly; for if he hadn't locked the pantry-door, 'tis an hundred to one I shouldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense! Nonsense!—I tell you, you've been guilty of stealing, which is a monstrous crime! And what did you steal? Had you taken any thing else, I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goose-pye!—As I'm a Christian, the identical goose-pye which I intended for my own supper!—But this is not my only objection to your conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What principally offends me is, that you per∣vert the minds of the maids, and keep kissing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh, fye! fye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I kiss and smuggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, 'tis they who kiss and smuggle me. I protest I do what I can to preserve my modesty; and I wish that Archbishop Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I read last night to the dairy-maid in the dark! he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking signify? The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the lustre of my eyes; and really the little devils are so tender, and so troublesome, that I'm half angry with nature for hav∣ing made me so very bewitching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense! Nonsense!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was but yesterday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs, quarrelling which looked neatest, my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are so fond and so coax∣ing! They hang about one so lovingly! And one says, "Kind Mr. Motley!" and t'other, "Sweet Mr. Mot∣ley!"—Ah! Father Philip! Father Philip! How is a poor little bit of flesh and blood, like me, to resist such temp∣tation?—Put yourself in my place: Suppose that a sweet smiling rogue, just sixteen, with rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, fye! fye! fye!—To hear such licentious discourse, brings the tears into my eyes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, Father; for I see the water is run∣ning over at your mouth. However, this shews you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shews me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown away upon you: In future, I shall keep those counsels to myself, which I offered you from motives of pure Christian charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="034000_0005_0FF9FDA7783056A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity, my good Father, should always begin at home: Now, instead of giving yourself so much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of correcting yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I?—I have nothing to correct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The odour of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has a powerful smell about it, I own, not un∣like carrion; you may wind it a mile off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>All malice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not exactly: I could mention some little points which might be altered in you still better than in myself; such as intemperance, gluttony—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gluttony?—Oh! abominable falsehood!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plain matter of fact!—Why will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fish, flesh and fowl? I protest I'm grate∣ful to Heaven, that among the unclean beasts who accompani∣ed Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they must infallibly have created a famine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled. Next, for incon∣tinence, you must allow yourself that you are unequalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I? I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, you. May I ask what was your business in the beech-grove the other evening, when I caught you with buxom Margery the miller's pretty wife? Was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly necessary: I was whispering in her ear wholesome advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed? Faith, then she took your advice as kindly as it was given, and exactly in the same way too: you gave it with your lips, and she took it with her's!—Well done, Father Philip!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Son, son, you give your tongue too great a li∣cense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Father, be not angry: Fools, you know, are privil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they are very useless ones: and in short, Master Motley, to be plain with you, of all fools, I think you the worst; and for fools of all kinds I've an in∣superable aversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really? Then you have one good quality at least,
<PB N="6" REF="034000_0006_0FF9FB9B8DD8BD20"/>and I cannot but admire such a total want of self-love! <STAGE>[A horn sounds.]</STAGE> But hark! 'tis the dinner horn. Away to ta∣ble, Father—Depend upon't, the servants will rather eat part of their dinner unblessed, than stay till your stomach comes, like Jonas's whale, and swallows up the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, fool, I am going: but first let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite: No, son, no. Little sustenance do I take; but St. Cuthbert's blessing is upon me, and that little prospers with me most marvellously. Verily, the saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase, and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his bounties.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Motl.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Alone.]</STAGE>
<P>He looks like an overgrown turtle, wad∣dling upon its hind fins! Yet at bottom 'tis a good fellow enough, warm-hearted, benevolent, friendly, and sincere; but no more intended by nature to be a monk, than I to be a maid of honour to the Queen of Sheba.</P>
<STAGE>Going.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PERCY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be mistaken: in spite of his dress, his features are too well known to me. Hist! Gilbert! Gilbert!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gilbert? Oh Lord, that's I!—Who calls?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you forgotten me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, that would be no easy matter: I never forgot in my life what I never knew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have ten years altered me so much that you can∣not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!—Can it be—Pardon, my dear master, pardon! In truth, you may well forgive my having forgotten <HI>your</HI> name, for at first I didn't very well remember my own. However, to prevent further mistakes, I must inform you, that he who in your father's service was Gilbert the knave, is Motley the fool in the service of Earl Osmond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of Earl Osmond? This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of use to me; and if the attachment which as a boy you professed for me still exits.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does with ardes unabated; for I'm not so un∣just as to attribute to you my expulsion from Alnwic Castle. In fact, I deserved it; for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever existed; conse∣quently old Earl Percy dismissed me from his service, but I know that it was sorely against your inclination. You were
<PB N="7" REF="034000_0007_0FF9FDAC05006158"/>then scarce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your childhood. I remember well your grief at parting with me, and that you slipped into my hand the purse which contained the whole of your little treasure. That act of kindness struck to my heart: I swore at the moment to love you through life, and if ever I forget my oath, damn me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>My honest Gilbert!—And what made you as∣sume this habit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my Lord! what could I do? In spite of my knavery and tricks, I was constantly upon the point of starving; and having once contracted an idle habit of eat∣ing, I never could bring myself to leave it off. After living five years by my wits, want drove me almost out of them. I knew not what course to take, when I heard that Earl Of∣mond's jester had fled the country. I exerted my knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitive's cast coat, was accept∣ed in his place by the Earl, and now gain an honest liveli∣hood by persuading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your change is for the better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinitely; indeed your fool is unive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sally preferred to your knave—and for this reason; your fool is cheated, your knave cheats. Now every body had rather cheat than be cheated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some truth in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Sir, may I ask, what brings you to Wales?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>A woman, whom I adore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I guessed that the business was about a petti∣coat. And this woman is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The orphan ward of a villager, without friends, without family, without fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great points in her favour, I must confess. And which of these excellen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ualities won your heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I had better reasons for bestowing it on her. No, Gilbert; I loved her for a person beautiful with∣out art, and graceful without affectation; for an heart tender without weakness, and noble without pride. I saw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions: they looked on her as a being of a superior order; and I felt, that she who gave such dignity to the cottage maid, must needs add new lustre to the coronet of the Percies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="034000_0008_0FF9FBA9721388C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I mean otherwise, I should blush for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet surely the baseness of her origin—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can to me be no objection: In giving her my hand I raise her to my station, not debase myself to her's, nor ever, while gazing on the beauty of a rose, did I think it less fair because planted by a peasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! And what says your good grumbling fa∣ther to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! he has long slept in the grave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he's quiet at last! Well, God grant him that peace in heaven, which he suffered nobody to enjoy on earth! But, his death having left you master of your ac∣tions, what obstacle now prevents your marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear. Fearful lest my rank should in∣fluence this lovely girl's affections, and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble, while she refused her heart to the man, I assumed a peasant's habit, and presented myself as Edwy the low-born and the poor. In this character I gain∣ed her heart, and resolved to hail, as Countess of Northum∣berland, the betrothed of Edwy the low-born and the poor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant the pretty soul wasn't displeased with the discovery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That discovery is still unmade. Judge how great must have been my disappointment, when, on entering her guardian's cottage with this design, he informed me, that the unknown, who sixteen years before had confided her to his care, had reclaimed her on that very morning, and convey∣ed her no one knew whither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was unlucky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it not? Ah! had I declared myself one day sooner, ere this she would have been my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and being your wife, if a stranger then had conveyed her no one knew whith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, in spite of his precautions, I have traced the stranger's course, and find him to be Kenric, a de∣pendant upon Earl Osmond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely 'tis not Lady Angela, who—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same! Speak, my good fellow, do you know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="034000_0009_0FF9FDB558C17A88"/>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by your description; for here she's under∣stood to be the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray, my mas∣ter's deceased friend. And what is your present intention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To demand her of the Earl in marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that will never do; for in the first place you'll not be able to get a sight of him. I've now lived with him five long years, and, till Angela's arrival, never witnessed a guest in the Castle. Oh! 'tis the most melancholy man∣sion! And as to its master, he's the very antidote to mirth. He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes lowering on you with a gloomy scowl. He never smiles; and to laugh in his presence would be high treason. He looks at no one, speaks to no one. None dare approach him, except Kenric and his four blacks; all others are or∣dered to avoid him; and whenever he quits his room, ding∣dong goes a great bell, and away run the servants like so many scared rabbits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange! and <HI>what</HI> reasons can he have for—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! reasons in plenty. You must know there's an ugly story respecting the last owners of this Castle. Os∣mond's brother, his wife, and infant child, were murdered by a banditti, as it was said. Unluckily, the only servant who escaped the slaughter, deposed, that he recognized among the assassins a black still in the service of Earl Osmond. The truth of this assertion was never known, for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since that time, no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle. Osmond instantly became gloomy and fe∣rocious; he now never utters a sound except a sigh, has broken every tie of society, and keeps his gates barred un∣ceasingly against the stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet Angela is admitted: But, no doubt, affec∣tion for her father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, no; I rather think that affection for her fa∣ther's child—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I've any knowledge in love, the Earl feels it for his fair ward: But the lady will tell you more of this, if I can procure for you an interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very request which—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no easy matter, I promise you; but I'll do
<PB N="10" REF="034000_0010_0FF9FBB1A5F32238"/>my best. In the meanwhile, wait for me in yonder fishing∣hut; its owner's name is Edric: tell him that I sent you, and he will give you a retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Farewel, then; and remember that whatever re∣ward—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear master, to mention a reward insults me. You have already shown me kindness; and when 'tis in my pow∣er to be of use to you, to need the inducement of a second favour would prove me a scoundrel undeserving of the first.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>How warm is this good fellow's attachment! Yet our Barons complain that the great can have no friends! If they have none, let their own pride <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar the blame. Instead of looking with scorn on those whom a smile would attract, and a favour bind forever, how many firm friends might our nobles gain, if they would but reflect that their vassals are men as they are, and have hearts whose feelings can be grateful as their own.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Hassan, what success?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>My search has been fruitless. In vain have I paced the river's banks, and pierced the grove's deepest recesses. Nor glen nor thicket have I passed unexplored, yet found no stranger to whom Kenric's description could apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Saw you no one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>A troop of horsemen passed me as I left the wood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Horsemen, say you? then Kenric may be right. Earl Percy has discovered Angela's abode, and lurks near the Castle in hopes of carrying her off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>His hopes then will be vain. Osmond's vigilance will not easily be eluded, sharpened by those powerful mo∣tives, love and fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>His love I know; but should he lose Angela, what has he to fear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Percy gains her, every thing! Supported by such wealth and power, dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered. Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he sooner hear that Northumberland loved her, than he hastened to remove her from Allan's
<PB N="11" REF="034000_0011_0FF9CD96A93D1548"/>care. At first I doubt his purpose was a foul one: her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it. He now is resolved to make her his bride, and restore to her those rights of which himself deprived her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think you the lady perceives that our master loves her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know she does not. Absorbed in her own pas∣sion for Percy, on Osmond's she bestows no thought; and, while roving through these pompous halls and chambers, sighs for the Cheviot hills, and Allan's humble cottage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as she still believes Percy to be a low-born swain, when Osmond days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his coronet at her feet, will she reject his rank and splendor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she loves well, she will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung! how incapable was all else to supply her loss! I have exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for rest, a wretched hut for a splendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil was sweet to me, for I laboured for Samba; then repose ever blest my bed of leaves, for there by my side lay Samba sleeping.</P>

<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>This from you, Hassan?—Did love ever find a place in your flinty bosom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did it? Oh Saib; my heart once was gentle, once was good! But sorrows have broken it—insults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native land! from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty years have elapsed since these Christ∣ians tore me away; they trampled upon my heart, mocked my despair; and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's soul could feel! In that moment, when the last point of Africa faded from my view, when as I stood on the vessel's deck, I felt that all I loved was to me lost forever! In that bitter moment did I banish humanity from my breast! I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the sea the precious token, and, while the high waves swift bore it from me, vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, and I <HI>will</HI> keep it.</P>

<P>His anxiety for independence, his wish to withdraw himself from Wales—yet more, certain mysterious words and threats for some time past have made our Lord uneasy. By him was I this morning commissioned—Silence! He's here, you shall know more anon.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Saib, the Earl's ingtatitude cuts me to the heart! Attached to him from his infancy, I have long been his friend, long fancied him mine: The illusion is now over. He sees that I can serve him no further—knows that I can harm him much; therefore he fears, and, fearing, hates me. But I will submit no longer to this painful depedence. To-morrow, for the last time, will I summon him to perform his promise; if he refuses, I will bid him farewel forever! and, by my absence, free him from a restraint equally irksome to myself and him.</P>

<P>No, no!—Proceed, I entreat you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, they do say, that the chamber in which you sleep is haunted. You may have observed two folding-doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead to the Oratory, in which the Lady Evelina passed most of her time, while my Lord was engaged in the Scottish wars. She would sit there, good soul! hour after hour, playing on the lute, and singing airs so sweet, so sad, that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her. Ah! when I kissed her hand at the Castle-gate, little did I suspect that her fate would have been so wretched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was her fate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sad one, Lady! Impatient to embrace her Lord, after a year's absence, the Countess set out to meet him on his return from Scotland, accompanied by a few do∣mestics and her infant daughter, then scarce a twelvemonth old. But, as she returned with her husband, robbers surpris∣ed the party scarce a mile from the Castle; and since that time, no news has been received of the Earl, of the Countess, the servants, or the child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful! Where not their corpses found?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never! The only domestic who escaped, pointed out the scene of action; and as it proved to be on the river's banks, doubtless the assassins plunged the bodies into the stream.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange! And did Earl Osmond then become owner of this Castle?—Alice! was he ever suspected of—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak lower, Lady! It was said so, I own; but for my own part I never believed it. To my certain knowl∣edge, Osmond loved the Lady Evelina too well to hurt her; and when he heard of her death, he wept and sobbed as if his heart were breaking. Nay, 'tis certain that he proposed to her before marriage, and would have made her his wife, only that she liked his brother better. Well she might, in∣deed; for Earl Reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in that Oratory, you say—Good Alice, you have the key of it: Let me see that Oratory to-night.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, truly, Alice; from good spirits I have noth∣ing to fear, and Heaven and my innocence will protect me against bad.</P>

<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now be good enough to explain what pur∣pose this masquerade is to answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly. You are to know, that since the late Earl's death, the Castle is thought to be haunted; the ser∣vants are fully persuaded that his ghost wanders every night through the long galleries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion. He is supposed to be drest in a complete armour; and that which you wear at present was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela; even now I heard her summoned to attend him in the Ar∣moury. Placed upon this pedestal, you may listen to their discourse unobserved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your mistress and her guardian. As soon as it grows dark, I will conduct you to Angela's apartments: the ob∣scurity will then shelter you from discovery; and even should you be observed, you will pass for Earl Reginald's spectre.</P>

</SP>

<P>Oh, Heaven forbid! Not a word of it. Had I minded all the strange things related of this Castle, I should have died of fright in the first half hour.

Above all, they say that the spirit of the late Countess sits nightly in her Oratory, and sings her baby to sleep. However, if it be so— <STAGE>[A bell sounds thrice, loud and solemn]</STAGE>—Hark!

<P>I will not sacrifice my happiness to her's! For six∣teen long years have I thirsted; and now, when the cup of joy again stands full before me, shall I dash it from my lip? No, Angela, you ask of me too much. Since the moment when I pierced her heart, deprived of whom life became odi∣ous; since my soul was stained with his blood who loved me, with her's whom I loved, no form has been grateful to my eye, no voice spoken pleasure to my soul, save Angela's, save only Angela's! Doating upon one whom death has long clasped in his arms; tortured by desires which I never hop∣ed to satisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguish, no guest but remorse at committing a fruitless crime. Hope, that stranger, once more visits my bosom: the fiend, who led me through passion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime so great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws unclose: Evelina revives in her daughter, and soon shall the fires which con∣sume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine? Because my short-lived joy may cause her eternal sorrow, shall I reject those pleasures sought so long, desired so earnestly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine she is,
<PB N="20" REF="034000_0020_0FF9FBE9F85616B0"/>and mine she shall be, though Reginald's bleeding ghost flit before me, and thunder in my ear—"Hold! hold!"—Peace, stormy heart! She comes!</P>

The birds which my own hands reared, and the flowers which my own hands planted; the banks on which I rested when fatigued, the wild tangled wood which supplied me with strawberries, and the village church where I prayed to be virtuous, while I yet knew of vice and virtue but the name, all have acquired rights to my memory and my love!</P>

<P>For the obscurity of his birth, chance must be blam∣ed; the merit of his virtues belongs wholly to himself.</P>

<P>By Heaven, you seem to think that poverty is a virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I think 'tis a misfortune, not a crime: And witen in-spite of nature's injustice, and the frowns of a preju∣diced and illiberal world, I see some low-born but illustrious spirit prove itself superior to the station which it fills, I hail it with pleasure, with admiration, with respect! Such a spirit I found in Edwy, and, finding, loved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>My blood boils with passion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say, that by these sentiments I disgrace my rank: I say, that to break my given word, would disgrace it more. Edwy has my plighted faith: He received it on the last evening which I passed in Northumberland, as we sat on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low bench before old Allan's cottage. It was an heavenly night, sweet and tranquil as the loves of angels: A gentle breeze whispered 'among the honeysuckles which bloomed above us, and the full moon tinged with her silver light the distant towers of Alnwick. It was then that for the first time I gave him my hand, and swore that I never would give it but to him: It was then that for the first time he pressed his lips to mine, and I swore that my lips should nev∣er be pressed by another!</P>

<P>If you have a generous mind, that will be my sur∣est safeguard. Be it my plea, Osmond, when thus I sue to you for mercy, for protection!

<P>Poor soul! And who has been thumping and bumping you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has? You should rather ask who has not.—Why only hear:—As I was just now going along the nar∣row passage which leads to the Armoury—singing to myself, and thinking of nothing, I met Lady Angela flying away as if for dear life!—So I dropp'd her a courtsey—but might as well have spared my pains. Without minding me any more than if I had been a dog or a cat, she pushed me on one side; and before I could recover my balance, somebody else, who came bouncing by me, gave me t'other thump—and there I lay sprawling upon the floor. However, I tumbled with all possible decency; and took great care that my petticoats should cover my legs.</P>

<P>Stay, Sir, and hear me!—By what authority pre∣sume you to call me captive?—Have you forgotten that you speak to Northumberland's Earl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well may I forget him, who could so far forget him∣self. Was it worthy of Northumberland's Earl to steal dis∣guised into my Castle, and plot with my servant to rob me of my most precious treasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine was that treasure. You deprived me of it basely, and I was justified in striving to regain my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Earl, nothing can justify unworthy means. If you were wronged, why sought you not your right with your sword's point? I then should have esteemed you a noble foe; and as such would have treated you: But you have stooped to paltry artisice, and attacked me like some midnight ruffian, privately, and in disguise. By this am I authorized to forget your station, and make your penance as degrading as your offence was base.</P>

<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>

Pleasure, sweet guest, so long a stranger, Oh to my bosom welcome once more!

<P>But till to-morrow? Oh! in that little space a lover's eye views myriads of dangers! Yet think not good Kenric, that your late services are undervalued by me, or that I have forgotten those for which I have long been your debtor. When, bewildered by hatred of Reginald, and grief for Evelina's loss, my dagger was placed on the throat of their infant, your hand arrested the blow—judge then how grateful I must feel, when I behold in Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a her mother's living counterpart—behold her such, as when shielding with her body her fallen husband, Evelina received that dagger in her breast, which I aimed at the heart of Reginald—Worthy Kenric, how can I repay your services?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>These you may easily: but what, Earl Osmond, what can repay me for the sacrifice of my innocence? I was virtuous till you bade me be guilty; my hands were pure till you taught me to stain them with blood! You painted in strong colours the shame of servitude—you promised free∣dom, riches, independence—you vanquished the resistance of my better angel, and never since have I known one mo∣ment of rest!</P>

<P>I help you to escape! Not for the best gown in your Ladyship's wardrobe. I tremble at the very idea of my Lord's rage; and, besides, had I the will, I've not the power. Kenric keeps the keys: we could not possibly quit the Castle without his knowledge; and if the Earl threatens to use force with you—Oh Gemni! what would he use with me, Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Threatens, Alice! I despise his threats! Ere it pillows Osmond's head, will I plunge this poniard in my bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Holy fathers!—A dagger!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even now, as I wandered through the Armoury, my eye was attracted by its glittering handle. Look, Alice! it bears Osmond's name; and the point—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is rusty with blood!—Take it away, Lady! take it away!—I never see blood without fainting!</P>

<STAGE>[Putting up the dagger.]</STAGE>
<P>This weapon may render me good service. But, ah! what service has it rendered Osmond! Haply 'twas this very poniard which drank his brother's blood, or which pierced the fair breast of Evelina!—Said you not, Alice, that this was her portrait?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Lady; and the likeness was counted ex∣cellent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>How fair! how heavenly! What sweetness, yet what dignity, in her blue, speaking eyes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder that you admire her, Lady: she was as like you as one pea to another. But this morning you know I promised to show you her Oratory, and here I've brought the key. Shall I unlock the door?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so, good Alice! Haply for a moment it may abstract my thoughts from my own sorrows.</P>

<P>This room has not been opened since my Lady's death, and every thing remains as she left it. Look,
<PB N="39" REF="034000_0039_0FF9CCF5F2DE8988"/>here is her veil—her prayer-book too, in which she was read∣ing on the very night before she quitted the Castle, never to return!</P>

<P>What alarms you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it you, Lady? let me die if I didn't take you for the ghost! Your air, your look, your attitude, all were so like the deceased Countess, that—Well, well, I'll not enter that room again in a hurry; I protest my hand trem∣bles so, that I can hardly turn the key.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>How contagious is terror; this silly woman's ap∣prehensions have spread to my bosom, and scarce can I look round without alarm. The stillness too of evening—the wavering and mysterious light which streams through these pointed windows—And, hark! 'twas the shriek of the screech-owl, which nests in the tower above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Having locked the folding doors]</STAGE>
<P>Ah! 'twas a sad day for me, when I heard of the dear Lady's loss! Look at that bed, Lady; that very bed was her's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it so? Oh! ho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often have I seen her sleeping in that bed! and oh! how like an angel she looked when sleeping! I remember that just after Earl Reginald—O Lord! didn't somebody shake the curtain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absurd! it was the wind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare it made me tremble. Well, as I was saying, I remember just after Earl Reginald had set out to the Scottish wars, going into her room one morning, and hearing her sob most bitterly; so advancing to the bed-side, as it might be thus—"My Lady," says I, with a low courtsey, "Isn't your Ladyship well?" so, with that she raised her

<P>To save me?—Speak!—Proceed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe this picture; it conceals a spring, whose secret is unknown to all in the Castle except myself. Upon touching it, the pannel slides back, and a winding passage opens into the marble hall; thence we must proceed to the vaulted vestibule; a door is there concealed similar to this; and, after threading the mazes of a subterranean labyrinth, we shall find ourselves in safety on the outside of the Castle walls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! worthy, worthy Father! quick let us hasten! Let us not lose one moment!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! hold! Not so fast. You forget, that between the hall and vestibule we must traverse many cham∣bers much frequented at this early hour. Wait till the Cas∣tle's inhabitants are asleep.

<P>This is thy doing, God of Justice! receive my thanks.—Yes, Percy, we shall meet once more—shall meet, never again to separate! Those dreams shall be realized, those smiling golden dreams which floated before us in Allan's happy cottage. Hand in hand shall we wander
<PB N="41" REF="034000_0041_0FF9FD3303AE4A90"/>together through life—partners in pleasure, partners in woe. And when the night of our existence arrives, one spot shall receive our bodies—one stone shall cover our grave. Allan too, and the worthy Maud!—my parents—my more than parents! to smooth the pillow of their age—to gild their last hours with sun-shine! that thought is heaven. So glo∣rious are my prospects, that they dazzle me to look on, and scarce can I believe them really to exist. Oh! gracious God! should my brain be bewildered by fancy—should I be now the sport of some deceitful dream, seal up my eyes forever, never let me wake again!—I must not expect the Friar before one; till that hour arrives, will I kneel at the feet of yonder Saint, there tell my beads, and pray for morning.</P>

<P>So! So!—Have I found you at last, Father?—I have been in search of you these four hours!—Oh! I've been so frightened since I saw you, that I wonder I keep my senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I; for I'm sure they're not worth the trouble. And, pray, what has alarmed you thus? I warrant you've taken an old cloak, pinned against the wall, for a Spectre, or discovered the devil in the shape of a tabby-cat.</P>

<P>For the love of Heav∣en, Father, don't name the devil! or, if you must speak of him, pray mention the good gentleman with proper politeness.

<P>Respect for the devil, you wicked woman!—for that perfidious serpent—that crafty seducer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! Hush!—Father, you make my teeth chat∣ter with fright. For aught I know he's within hearing, for he certainly haunts this Castle in the form of my late Lady.</P>

<P>Form of a fiddlestick!—Don't tell me of your—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Father, on the word of a virgin, I saw him this very evening in Lady Angela's bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Lady Angela's?—On my conscience, the devil has an excellent taste! But, Alice! Alice!—how dare you trot about the house at this time of night, propa∣gating such abominable falsehoods?—One comfort is, that nobody will believe you. Lady Angela's virtue is too well known, and I'm persuaded she wouldn't suffer the devil to put a single claw into her bed for the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you run on!—Lord bless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, she wasn't in bed herself.</P>

<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!—Was she not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure: But you shall hear how it hap∣pened. We were in the Cedar-room together; and while we were talking of this and that, Lady Angela suddenly gave a great scream. I looked round, and what should I se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but a tall figure all in white extended upon the bed! At the same time I heard a voice, which I knew to be the Countess Evelina's, pronounce in an hollow tone—"Alice!—Alice! Alice!"—three times. You may be certain that I was frightened enough. I instantly took to my heels; and just as I got without side of the door, I heard a loud clap of thunder, and the whole chamber shook as if tumbling into a thousand pieces!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well done, Alice!—A very good story, upon my word: It has but one fault—'Tis not true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ods my life, Father, how can you tell any thing about it? Sure I should know best; for I was there, and you were not. I repeat it—I heard the voice as plain as I hear your'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Do you think I've no ears?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! far from it: I think you've uncommon∣ly good ones; for you not only hear what has been said, but what has not. Hark!—the clock strikes twelve:—'Tis late, and I'm sleepy, so shall bid you farewel for the present. As to this wonderful story of yours, Alice, I don't believe
<PB N="43" REF="034000_0043_0FF9FD3781C51C18"/>one word of it: I'll be sworn that the voice was no more like your Lady's than like mine; and that the devil was no more in the bed than I was. Therefore, take my advice, set your heart at rest, and go quietly to your chamber, as I am now going to mine.—Good night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good night?—Surely you'll not have the heart to leave me in this terrible situation!—Suppose Satan should appear to me when I'm alone!—Sinner that I am, I should certainly die of the fright!—Good Father, you are a priest, and an holy man; your habit frightens the evil spirits, and they dare not come near you:—Oh! if you will but suffer me to pass the night in your company—</P>

<P>What's the matter now?</P>

<P>Does not my sacred habit inspire you with awe?—Does not the exemplary chastity of my past life warn you to conceal such licentious desires?—Pass the night with me, indeed?—I'm shocked at the very thought!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it for this that you still flattered my person, and declared that nothing became a man more than a big belly?—Was it for this that you strove to win my heart through the medium of my stomach; that you used to come languishing every day with some liquorish dish; and, while you squeezed my left hand tenderly, placed a sack-posset in the right?—Heavens! how deep-laid were your plans of seduction!—But mark me, tempter: In vain has the soup been salted, the ragout seasoned, and the pepper-box shaken with unsparing hand! My virtue is proof against all your culinary spell; the fairness of my innocence is still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>blem∣ished; and in spite of your luscious stews and savoury hash∣es, I retire like a second St. Anthony, victorious from Temp∣tation's lists!</P>

<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your folly well deserved such a reward. Know∣ing the Earl's hasty nature, you should have shunned him till the first storm of passion was past, and circumstances had again made your ministry needful.

<SPEAKER>Hass.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for his virtues, but for his vices, Saib: Can there for me be a greater cause to love him? Am I not branded with scorn? Am I not marked out for dishonour? Was I not free, and am I not a slave? Was I not once be∣loved, and am I not now despised? What man, did I tender my service, would accept the negro's friendship? What wo∣man, did I talk of affection, would not turn from the negro with disgust? Yet, in my own dear land, my friendship was courted, my love was returned. I had parents, children, wife!—Bitter thought, in one moment all were lost to me! Can I remember this, and not hate these white men? Can I think how cruelly they have wronged me, and not rejoice when I see them suffer?—Attached to Osmond, say you? Saib, I hate him! Yet viewing him as an avenging friend sent hither to torment his fellows, it glads me that he fills his office so well. Oh! 'tis a thought which I would not barter for empires, to know that in this world he makes oth∣ers suffer, and will suffer himself for their tortures in the next!</P>

<P>Compose yourself, my Lord: Can a mere dream unman you thus?</P>

<P>A mere dream, say'st thou? Hassan, 'twas a dream of such horror! Did such dreams haunt my bitterest foe, I should wish him no severer punishment. Mark you not, how the ague of fear makes my limbs tremble? Rolls not my eye, as if still gazing on the Spectre? Are not my lips convulsed, as were they yet prest by the kiss of corruption? Oh! 'twas a sight, that might have bleached joy's rosy cheek for ever, and strewed the snows of age upon youth's auburn ringlets! Yet, away with these terrors!—Hassan, thou saidst, 'twas but a dream: I was deceived by fancy. Hassan, thou saidst true; there is not, there cannot be, a world to come.</P>

<P>My Lord!—</P>

Plunge the rather in the thickest gloom of Atheism! Say, that with my body, must perish my soul! For, oh! should my fear∣ful dream be prophetic!—Hark, fellows! Instruments of my guilt, listen to my punishment!—Methought I wandered through the low-browed caverns, where repose the reliques of my ancestors. My eye dwelt with awe on their tombs, with disgust on Mortality's surrounding emblems! Sudden∣ly
<PB N="46" REF="034000_0046_0FF9CD14C1801FF0"/>a female form glided along the vault: It was Angela! She smiled upon me, and beckoned me to advance. I flew towards her; my arms were already unclosed to clasp her—when suddenly her figure changed, her face grew pale, a stream of blood gushed from her bosom!—Hassan, 'twas Evelina!</P>

<P>Evelina!</P>

<P>Such as when she sank at my feet expiring, while my hand grasped the dagger, still crimsoned with her blood!—"We meet again this night!" murmured her hollow voice! "Now rush to my arms, but first see what you have made me! Embrace me, my bridegroom! We must never part again!"—While speaking, her form withered away: the flesh fell from her bones; her eyes burst from their sockets: a skeleton, loathsome and meagre, clasped me in her moul∣dering arms!—</P>

<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most horrible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her infected breath was mingled with mine; her rotting fingers pressed my hand, and my face was covered with her kisses! Oh! then, then how I trembled with dis∣gust! And now blue dismal flames gleamed along the walls; the tombs were rent asunder; bands of fierce spectres rushed round me in frantic cance; furiously they gnashed their teeth while they gazed upon me, and shrieked in loud yell—"Welcome, thou fratricide! Welcome, thou lost forev∣er!"—Horror burst the hands of sleep; distracted I flew hither: But my feelings—words are too weak, too power∣less to express them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, my Lord, this was no idle dream! 'Twas a celestial warning; 'twas your better Angel that whispered—"Osmond, repent your former crimes! Com∣mit not new ones!"—Remember, that this night should Kenric.—</P>

<P>Obedience to your orders, I presented it at supper; but ere the cup reached his lips, his favourite dog sprang up∣on his arm, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uor fell to the ground untasted.</P>

Proofs he cannot bring against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bare assertions will not be believed.

<PB N="47" REF="034000_0047_0FF9FD40A515FCF0"/>her from me, shall Angela be mine. Angela!—Oh! at that name all again is calm in my bosom. Hushed by her image, my tumultuous passions sink to rest, and my terrors subside into that single fear—her loss! I forget that I have waded to her arms through blood; forget all, save my affec∣tion and her beauty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saib.</SPEAKER>
<P>You forget too that her heart is another's? Oh! my Lord, reflect on your conduct while it is yet time; re∣store the poor Angela to liberty; resign her to her favoured lover—</P>

<P>Sooner will I resign my life!—Fellow, you know not what you say: My heart-strings are twisted round the maid; ere I resign her, those strings must break.

Follow me, Saib, and watch me whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I sleep.

There was a time, when thy presence brought oblivion to my sorrows; when thy poppy-crown was min∣gled with roses!—Now, Fear and Remorse thy sad compan∣ions, I shudder to see thee approach my couch!

Ha! has my bosom still room for thoughts so tender? Hence with them! Vengeance must possess it all! Oh! when I forget my wrongs, may I forget myself! When I forbear to hate these Christians, God of my fathers! mayst thou hate me!—Ha! Whence that light? A man moves this way with a lamp! How cautiously he steals along! He must be watched.

<P>Will it never arrive—this tedious lingering hour? Sure an age must have elapsed since the Friar left me, and still the bell strikes not One!—Percy, does thy impatience equal mine? Dost thou too count the moments which divide us? Dost thou too chide the slowness of time's pinions, which moved so swiftly when we strayed together on the Cheviot Hills? Methinks I see him now, as he paces the Conway's margin: If a leaf falls, if a bird flutters, he flies towards it; for he thinks 'tis the footstep of Angela: Then, with slow steps and bending head, disappointed he regains the fisher's cottage. Perhaps, at this moment, his eyes like mine are sixed on yonder planet; perhaps this sweet wind which plays on my cheek, is freighted with the sighs of my lover.—Oh! sigh no more, my Percy! Soon shall I repose in safety on your bosom; soon again see the moon shed her silver light on Cheviot, and hear its green hills repeat the carol of your mellow horn!</P>

<P>What means this mystery? This midnight visit—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the visit of a friend, of a penitent!—Lady, I must away from the Castle: The keys are in my possession: I will make you the companion of my flight, and deliver you safe into the hands of Percy.

<P>Rise, Kenric: I understand you not. Of what captive do you speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of one, who by me has been most injured, who to you will be most dear. Listen, Lady, to my strange narra∣tion. I was brought up with Osmond, was the partner of his pleasures, the confident o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cares. The latter sprang solely from his elder brother, whose birth-right he coveted, whose superiority he envied. Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsion burst not forth, till Evelina Neville, rejecting his hand, bestowed her's with
<PB N="50" REF="034000_0050_0FF9FC9CC9027CF0"/>her heart on Reginald. Then did Osmond's passion over∣leap all bounds. He resolved to assassinate his brother when returning from the Scottish wars, carry off the Lady, and make himself master of her person by force. This scheme he imparted to me: He flattered, threatened, promised—and I yielded to his seduction!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wretched man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Condemn me not unheard. 'Tis true, that I fol∣lowed Osmond to the scene of slaughter, but no blood that day imbrued my hand. It was the Earl whose sword struck Reginald to the ground; it was the Earl whose dagger was raised to complete his crime, when Evelina threw herself up∣on her husband's body, and received the weapon in her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful! Dreadful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>His hopes disappointed by this accident, Osmond's wrath became madness. He gave the word for slaughter, and Reginald's few attendants were butchered on the spot. Scarce could my prayers and arguments save from his wrath his infant niece, whose throat was already gored by his poniard. Angela, your's still wears that mark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine?—Almighty Powers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady, 'tis true. I concealed in Allan's cottage the heiress of Conway: There were you doomed to languish in obscurity, till, alarmed by the report of the spies that Per∣cy loved you, and dreading your meeting with so powerful a supporter, Osmond decreed your death a second time. With this intention he sought your retreat; but when in you he beheld Evelina's living image, he changed his bloody pur∣pose. He cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to reclaim you from Allan, and resolv∣ed, by making you his wife, to give himself a lawful claim to these possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>The monster! Now then I know, when he pressed my hand, why still my blood ran cold! 'Twas nature, that revolted at the fratricide's touch: 'Twas my mother's spirit, that whispered, "Love not my murderer!" Oh! good, good Kenric! And you knelt to me for pardon? You, to whom I owe my life! You, to whom—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! oh hold!—Lady, how little do I deserve your thanks!—Oh listen, listen!—I was the last to quit the bloody spot. Sadly was I retiring, when a faint groan struck my ear. I sprang from my horse; I placed my hand on Reginald's heart; it beat beneath the pressure!</P>

<P>Oh! that would have been mercy! No, Lady, I preserved his life to rob him of liberty. It struck me, how strong would be my hold over Osmond, while his brother was in my power; and this reflection determined me to pre∣serve him. Having plunged the other bodies in the Conway's stood, I placed the bleeding Earl's on my horse before me, and conveyed him still insensible to a retreat, to all, except myself, a secret. There I tended his wounds carefully, and succeeded in preserving his life. Lady—Reginald still exists.</P>

<P>He does, if a life so wretched can be termed ex∣istence. While his swoon lasted, I chained him to his dun∣geon wall; and no sooner were his wounds healed, than I entered his prison no more. Through a wicket in his dun∣geon door I supplied him with food; and when in plaintive terms he sued to me for mercy, hastily I fled, nor gave an an∣swer.

<P>Very true: But, Lord! if a man was always taken at his word, the world would soon be turned upside down.

Oh, when I was in love, I managed matters much better: I always paid my addresses by the fire-side, and contrived to urge my soft suit just at dinner time! Then how I filled my fair-one's ears with fine speeches, while she silled my trencher with roast beef! Then what sigures and tropes came out of my mouth, and what dainties and tid-bits went in!

<PB N="57" REF="034000_0057_0FF9FD5BB4C9C758"/>father the honour to superintend his culinary concerns. I was scarce fifteen, when she kindled a flame in my heare while lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her.

Yes, I was happy!—Yet frown not on me, therefore, Darkness! I am thine again, my gloomy bride!—Be not incensed, Despair, that I left thee for a moment; I have passed with thee sixteen years! Ah! how many have I still to pass?—Yet fly not my bosom quite, sweet Hope I Still speak to me of liberty, of light! Whisper, that once more I shall see the morn break, that again shall my fevered lips drink the pure gale of evening!—God, thou knowest that I have borne my sufferings meekly: I have wept for myself, but never cursed my foes; I have sorrowed for thy anger, but never murmured at thy will.

Oh! then, how my heart swells with bitterness, when the sound of his retiring steps is heard no more, when through you lofty chasm I catch no longer the gleam of his departing torch! How wastes my lamp? The hour of Ken∣ric's visit must long be past, and still he comes not. How, if death's hand hath struck him suddenly? My existence un∣known—Away from my fancy, dreadful idea! <STAGE>[Rising, and taking the lamp.]</STAGE> The breaking of my chain permits me to wander at large through the wide precincts of my prison.

My hopes are vain, my search will be fruitless. Despair in these dungeons reigns despotic; she mocks my complaints, rejects my prayers, and, when I sue for freedom, bids me seek it in my grave.

<P>The fountains of my eyes have been long dried up: I have no tears that can soften, no eloquence that can persuade; but Heaven has lightnings that can blast! Then spare me, Osmond! Kenric has told me that my daughter lives! Restore me to her arms; permit us in obscurity to pass our days together! Then shall my last sigh implore up∣on your head Heaven's forgiveness and Evelina's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be so.—Rise, Reginald, and hear me! You mentioned even now your daughter: Know, she is in my power; know also, that I love her!</P>

<SPEAKER>Reg.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>

<P>She rejects my offers. Your authority can oblige her to accept them. Swear to use it, and this instant will I lead you to her arms.</P>

<P>Osmond, she is your niece!</P>

<P>I have influence at Rome—That obstacle will be none to me.—What is your answer? You hesitate! Say, will you give the demanded oath?</P>

<P>I cannot dissemble—Osmond, I never will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?—Reflect that your life—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would be valueless, if purchased by my daughter's tears; would be loathsome, if embittered by my daughter's misery. Osmond, I will not take the oath.</P>
