<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Compiler of the following sheets, sensible that nothing new can be said upon the following intricate doc∣trines of Predestination, Election and Reprobation, has no de∣sign to impose upon the Public—but in a plain, humble and concise manner, republish those doctrines unveiled from that sophistry, art and prolixity, so frequently experienced in mo∣dern publications of this kind, from which the community at large can derive no benefit, for the want of time, education and skill to trace the metaphysical subtilties of Calvinian wri∣ters.</P>
<P>Therefore, that the humble enquirer after <HI>the truth as it is in</HI> JESUS, may not be lost in the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of human controversy, but may be led, by proper motives, right views, upon rational principles, and by the plain declarations of <HI>God,</HI> to believe, and practice in that unadulterated faith, <HI>once delivered to the Saints,</HI> the following publication is offered to be tried by the touchstone of <HI>Truth.</HI> And furthermore, that his fellow citi∣zens may be secured, not only from the errors and violence of sectarists and enthusiasts, but may escape the vortex of in∣fidelity, which, in the present age, like a <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iah,</HI> comes forth defying the SAVIOR of lost men. And painful it is, for the true Christian, to hear <HI>"tyrannic dogmas"</HI> charged upon Christianity, that have no existence in the oracles of God.— To mention but one instance out of the many we have in a late Deistical publication, from the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Boulanger;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Entitled, Christianity Unveiled.</NOTE> his words are as follows—" The fatalism of the Grecian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as been transformed, in the hands of Christian Priests, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pre∣destination. According to this tyrannic dogma, the God of mercies has destined the greatest part of mankind to eternal torments. He places them in this world that they, by the abuse of their faculties and liberty, may render themselves worthy of the implacable wrath of their Creator.—"A be∣nevolent and prescient God, gives to man a free will, of which he knows<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nay, fore-ordains that they shall.</NOTE> they will make so perverse an use, as to merit eternal damnation."</P>
<P>That this kind of Predestination is the genuine offspring of heathenish fatality, is too obvious to need illustration;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the great Palagian controversy, in the 3d century, when Austin first introduced it into the Christian Church, disputing with Palagius.</NOTE> but it is false, and to the last degree cruel and absurd, when ei∣ther called the dogma or doctrine of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029479_0005_0FE13B31E4A731A8"/>
And, I pray <HI>God</HI> to enlighten the minds (of otherwise well m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning people) of the followers of Calvin, and other Chris∣tian fatalists, that they may perceive, while they are endea∣voring to unit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the decrees and fore-knowledge of God, they are rending <HI>Christ's</HI> seamless vesture in pieces, by destroying the unity of faith, introducing Pagan Theology, opening the flood-gates of Deism, and hastening the awful period, when Christ shall scarce <HI>find faith on the earth!</HI></P>
<P>Undoubtedly there will arise objections against this publi∣cation; some will say the quotations are false—that these words were not spoken by these authors, or, at least not in this sense. But this may be easily determined by reading those authors, where they all undeniably stand, and were taken and defended in this sense, throughout the whole trea∣tises, from whence they are taken.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Five Articles at the close of the Preface.</NOTE> Others will say, <HI>that modern Divines, upon the Edwardean plan, do not hold nor preach so.</HI> (The glaring absurdity of the doctrine, with its fright∣ful consequences▪ is so awful, that many have endeavoured to soften their principles, by the unexplained phrase, <HI>"moder∣ate Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vinis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s."</HI>) But the following quotation from <HI>Jonathan Edwards, D. D.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">An Ordination Sermon, preached at Hambden, Con∣necticut, 1792, page 8.</NOTE> compared with Mr. <HI>Hopkins's</HI> System of Di∣vinity, and Doct. <HI>West,</HI> on Moral Agency, will decide the matter. And, I charitably hope, undeceive the wandering sheep, and bring them home, to the <HI>shepherd and bishop of their souls.</HI></P>
<P>"The doctrine of the Divine Decrees, which is <HI>that God hath for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-ordained whatsoever comes to pass,</HI> is a profitable doct∣rine." "It would seem unaccountable that God should build such a vast structure as that of the created universe, and not fix the scheme of it in his own mind, before he began; but should enter upon it without design, without plan, without system. How could this be reconciled with even human wisdom, much more with divine, which is infinite?<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is curious to see the inconsistency of error: at one time these Divines will not admit man's natural reason as any guide in Religion—at another time will appeal to its ac∣knowledged fallibility, to prove the infallibility of God.</NOTE> If a human architect, about to build, should collect materials of various kinds and dimensions, but should collect them with∣out design and without determining their proper uses and ap∣plications, we should all agree to condemn him either for his ignorance, or his negligence."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Permit me to recommend to these gentlemen and others, who reason after this manner, the following texts, Ps. 50.21. Isa. 55.8, 9. Deut. 29.29. Job 11.7, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>

Again, page 17. "Nor is the doctrine of total depravity less useful than true."—I observe, he who acknowleges <HI>total depravity,</HI> and that <HI>God fore-ordains whatsoever comes to pass,</HI> must acknowledge and believe every assertion hereafter mention∣ed; or deny that causes will produce effects.</P>
<P>But may we all remember that we are but finite creatures, <HI>prone to evil, at our best estate but vanity,</HI> subject to prejudice and partiality; that we <HI>walk by faith,</HI> not <HI>by sight,</HI> seeing as it were <HI>through a glass darkly.</HI> Then shall we cease from the endless disputes about the <HI>Divine Decrees,</HI> lay <HI>aside the old man, put on the new,</HI> and hereafter <HI>see also</HI> as we <HI>are seen.</HI> That this may be the happy portion of all, let us lay down our spiritual weapons of hostility, unite in one Faith and Baptism, and with one heart and voice, pray for the one <Q><HI>universal Church,</HI> that it may be so guided and governed by the one spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians, may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE SCRIPTURE DOCTRINE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE scripture saith,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 4.</NOTE> God <HI>hath chosen us in</HI> Christ, <HI>be∣fore the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love.</HI> And St. Peter calls the saints,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 2.</NOTE> <HI>elect according to the foreknowledge of</HI> God <HI>the Father, through sanc∣tification of the spirit, unto obedience.</HI> And St. Paul saith unto them,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ii. 13, 24.</NOTE> God <HI>hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the spirit, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lief of the truth; whereunto he hath called you by our gospel, to the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing of the glory of our</HI> Lord Je∣sus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. From all these places of scripture it is plain that God had chosen some to life and glory before, or from the founda∣tion of the world. And the wisdom of all Christians is, to labour that their judgments may be informed herein, accord∣ing to the scripture. And to that end let us consider the manner of God's speaking to the sons of men.</P>
<P N="3">3. God saith to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Rom. iv. 17. <HI>As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, before him who believed, even</HI> God <HI>who quickeneth the dead and calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI> Observe, God speaks then, at that present time, to <HI>Abraham</HI> saying, <HI>I have made thee a father of many nations,</HI> not∣withstanding Abraham was not at that time the father of one child, but <HI>Ishmael.</HI> How then must we understand <HI>I have made thee a father of many nations?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The apostle tells us plainly, it was so, <HI>Before</HI> God <HI>who calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI> And so he calleth <HI>Abraham, the father of many nations,</HI> though he was not as yet the father even of <HI>Isaac, in whom his seed was to be called.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. God useth the same manner of speaking, when he calleth Christ,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>The lamb slain from the foundation of the world;</HI> although indeed he was not slain for some thousand years after. Hence therefore we may easily understand what he speaketh of <HI>elect∣ing us from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. God calleth <HI>Abraham a father of many nations,</HI> though not so at that time. He calleth <HI>Christ, The Lamb slain from the foun∣dation of the world,</HI> though not slain till he was a man in the
<PB N="10" REF="029479_0009_0FE13B4A71077F98"/>flesh. Even so he calleth men <HI>Elected from the foundation of the world,</HI> though not elected till they were men in the flesh.— Yet it is all so before God, who knowing all things from eternity, <HI>calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. By all which it is clear, that as Christ was called <HI>The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,</HI> and yet not slain till some thousand years after, till the day of his death; so also men are called <HI>elect from the foundation of the world,</HI> and yet are not elected perhaps till some thousand years after, till the day of their conversion to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. And indeed this is plain, without going farther, from those very words of St. Peter, <HI>elect, according to the fore-know∣ledge of</HI> God, <HI>through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.</HI>— For,</P>
<P>If the elect are chosen through sanctification of the Spirit, then they were not chosen before they were sanctified by the Spirit. But they were not sanctified by the Spirit, before they had a being. It is plain then neither were they chosen from the foundation of the world. But God <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. This is also plain from those words of St. Paul, God <HI>hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the spirit, and belief of the truth.</HI> Now,</P>
<P>If the saints are chosen to salvation, through believing of the truth, and were called to believe that truth by the hear∣ing of the gospel, then they were not chosen before they be∣lieved the truth, and before they heard the gospel, whereby they were called to believe. For they were chosen through belief of the truth, and called to believe it by the gospel.— Therefore they were not chosen before they believed; much less before they had a being, any more than Christ was slain before he had a being. So plain is it, that they were not elected, till they believed; although God <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Again, how plain is it, where St. Paul saith, that they whom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 11, 12.</NOTE> God <HI>did predestinate, according to the council of his own will, to be the praise of his glory,</HI> were such as did <HI>first trust in</HI> Christ? And in the very next verse, he saith that they <HI>trusted in</HI> Christ <HI>after they heard the word of truth,</HI> (not before.)— But they did not hear the word before they were born.— Therefore it is plain, the act of election is <HI>in time,</HI> though known of God before; who, according to his knowledge, of∣ten speaketh of the things <HI>which are not, as though they were.</HI>— And thus is the great-stumbling block about election taken away, that men may <HI>make their calling and election sure.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. The scripture tells us as plainly what predestination
<PB N="11" REF="029479_0010_0FE13B530F637FB8"/>is; it is God's fore-appointing obedient believers to salva∣tion, not without, but <HI>according to his fore-knowledge</HI> of all their works, <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI> And so likewise he predestinates or fore-appoints all disobedient unbelievers to damnation, not without, but <HI>according to his fore-knowledge</HI> of all their works, <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. We may consider this a little farther. God from the foundation of the world, fore-knew all men's believing or not believing. And according to this his fore-knowledge, he chose or elected all obedient believers, as such, to salvation, and refused or <HI>reprobated</HI> all disobedient unbelievers, as such, to damnation. Thus the scriptures teach us to consider <HI>elec∣tion</HI> and <HI>reprobation, according to the fore-knowledge of</HI> God <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But here some may object, that I hold our faith and obedience to be the cause of God's electing us to glory.</P>
<P>I answer, I do hold, that faith in Christ producing obedi∣ence to him is <HI>a cause without which</HI> God elected none to glory; for we never read of God's electing to glory, any who lived and died disobedient unbelievers. But I do not hold, that it is the <HI>cause for which</HI> he elects any: the contrary of this is easily shewn thus:</P>
<P>Suppose my obedience is a cause of my election to salvation, What is the cause of my obedience? <HI>Ans.</HI> My love to Christ.</P>
<P>But what is the cause of my love to Christ?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> My faith in Christ.</P>
<P>But what is the cause of my faith in Christ?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The preaching of the gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>But what is the cause of the preaching of the gospel to us?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Christ's dying for us.</P>
<P>But what is the cause of Christ's dying for us?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> God's great love of pity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and sins.</P>
<P N="14">14. Thus all men may see that I do not hold God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any man to life and salvation for any good which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, or for any which was in him, before he put it there. And this I shall now shew more at large from the oracles of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. God's great love of pity, where with he loved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ons of men, even while they were dead in trespasses and sins, was the cause of his sending his Son to die for them; as ap∣pears from the following scriptures:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE> God <HI>so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eve in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> For<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>when we were yet without strength, in due time</HI> Christ <HI>died for the ungodly.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="029479_0011_0FE13B584FED02D8"/>And, God <HI>commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet sin∣ners,</HI> Christ <HI>died for us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Christ's dying for our sins is the cause of the gospel's be∣ing preached to us, as appears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18.</NOTE> Jesus <HI>came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The gospel's being preached to sinners is the cause of their believing, as appears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Men's believing is the cause of their justification, as ap∣pears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 39.</NOTE> <HI>By him all that believe are justified from all things.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>He is the justifier of all that believe in</HI> Jesus. <HI>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law.</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 3, 23, &amp;c.</NOTE> Abraham <HI>believed</HI> God, <HI>and it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us also to whom it shall be impu∣ted, if we believe on him that raised up</HI> Jesus <HI>from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and rose again for our justification.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Our knowing ourselves justified by faith is the cause of our love to Christ, as appears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Here∣in is love, not that we loved</HI> God, <HI>but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</HI><NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 19.</NOTE> <HI>We love him because he first loved us.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Our love to Christ is the cause of our obeying him, as appears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 21, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>If ye love me, keep my com∣mandments. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> And, <HI>If any man love me, he will keep my words.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 3.</NOTE> <HI>For this is the love of</HI> God, <HI>that we keep his Com∣mandments.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Our obeying Christ is the cause of his giving us eternal life, as appears from those scriptures,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Not every one that saith unto me,</HI> Lord, Lord, <HI>shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</HI> And<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 9.</NOTE> Christ <HI>being made perfect through sufferings, he became the au∣thor of eternal salvation to all that obey him.</HI></P>

15. This may be more briefly expressed thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. God's love was the cause of his sending his Son to die for sinners.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Christ's dying for sinners is the cause of the gospel's be∣ing preached.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The preaching of the gospel is the cause (or means) of our believing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Our believing is the cause (or condition) of our justifi∣cation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The knowing ourselves justified through his blood, is the cause of our love to Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Our love to Christ is the cause of our obedience to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Our obedience to Christ is the cause of his becoming the author of eternal salvation to us.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="16">16. These following things therefore ought well to be considered by all that fear God.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There was a necessity of God's love in sending his Son to die for us, without which he had not came to die.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There was a necessity of Christ's love in dying for us, without which the gospel could not have been preached.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There was a necessity of the gospel's being preached, without which there could have been no believing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There is a necessity of our believing the gospel, without which we cannot be justified.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. There is a necessity of our being justified by faith in the blood of Christ, without which we cannot come to know that he <HI>loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. There is a necessity of our knowing his love, who first love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, without which we cannot keep his commandments.</ITEM>

<ITEM>8. There is a necessity of keeping his commandments, with∣out which we cannot enter into eternal life.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>By all which we see, that there is as great a necessity of of our keeping the commandments of God, as there was of God's sending his Son into the world, or of Christ's dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our sins.</P>
<P N="17">17. But for whose sins did Christ die? Did he die for <HI>all</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but for <HI>some?</HI></P>
<P>To this also I shall answer by the scriptures, shewing 1. The testimony of all the prophets. 2. Of the angel of God. 3. Of Christ himself. And, 4. Of his apostles.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> saith thus:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah liii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our Sorrows: yet did we esteem him stricken, smit∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of</HI> God <HI>and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was up∣on
<PB N="14" REF="029479_0013_0FE13B6A7A851440"/>him, and with his stripes we are healed. And we like sheep, have gone astray: we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</HI> Thus Isaiah sheweth plain∣ly, that the iniquities of all those who went astray, were laid upon Christ. And to him the testimony of all the other pro∣phets agreeth:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 43.</NOTE> <HI>To give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</HI> The same saith that great prophet, John the Baptist, who<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John i. 7.</NOTE> <HI>came to bear witness of the light, that</HI> all men <HI>through it might believe.</HI>—. And again,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid verse 29.</NOTE> <HI>Behold,</HI> saith he, <HI>the Lamb of</HI> God, <HI>that taketh away the sin</HI> of the world. Thus have all the prophets, with one consent, testified that God <HI>laid upon</HI> Christ <HI>the iniquities of all</HI> that were <HI>gone astray:</HI> that he is <HI>the Lamb of</HI> God <HI>which taketh away the sin of the world; that all men through him may believe:</HI> and that <HI>through his name whosoever believeth in him, shall receive re∣mission of sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The angel of God testified the same thing, saying,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Fear not; for I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people,</HI> which was, that there was <HI>born unto them a Saviour, even Christ the Lord.</HI> By this also it appears, that Christ died for all men. For else it could not have been glad tidings of great joy to all people; but rather sad tidings to all those for whom he died not.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We come now to the words of Christ himself, who knew his own business better than any man else; and there∣fore if his testimony agree with these, we must needs be con∣vinced that they are true. Now he speaks thus,<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">John iii. 14, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For</HI> God <HI>so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For</HI> God <HI>sent not his Son to condemn the world, but that the world through hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might be saved.</HI> Thus we see the words of Christ agree with the words of the prophets; there∣fore it must needs be owned that Christ died for all.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> And now we will hear what the apostles say con∣cerning this thing.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 14, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The love of Christ,</HI> saith the Apostle Paul, <HI>constraineth us, before we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again.</HI> And to Timothy he saith,<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>There is one</HI> God, <HI>and one</HI> Mediator <HI>between</HI> God <HI>and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</HI> Again
<PB N="15" REF="029479_0014_0FE13B77E7FDF210"/>he saith to Titus,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>The grace of God, which bringeth salvation is all men, hath appeared.</HI> And yet again to the Hebrews,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>That he, by the grace of</HI> God, <HI>tasted death for every man.</HI> And to this agreeth St. John, witnessing,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</HI>— And again, speaking of himself and the rest of the apostles, he saith,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 14.</NOTE> <HI>We have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son, to be the Saviour of the world.</HI> Thus we have the testimony of all the prophets, of the angel of God, of Christ himself, and of his holy apostles, all agreeing together in one to prove, that Christ died for all mankind.</P>
<P N="18">18. What then can they, who deny this, say? Why, they commonly say, <HI>All men,</HI> in these scriptures, does not mean <HI>all men,</HI> but only <HI>the elect;</HI> that <HI>every man</HI> here does not mean <HI>every man,</HI> but only every one of the elect; that <HI>the world</HI> does not mean the <HI>whole world,</HI> but only the world of believers: and that the <HI>whole world,</HI> in St. John's words, does not mean <HI>the whole world,</HI> but only the whole world of the elect.</P>
<P N="19">19. To this shameless, senseless evasion, I answer thus:</P>
<P>If the scripture no where speaks of a world of believers or elect, then we have no ground, reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pretence, or excuse for saying, Christ d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed only for a world of believers or elect. But the scripture no where speaks of such a world. There∣fore we have no ground or pretence for speaking thus.</P>
<P>Nay, the scripture is so far from calling believers or elect∣ed persons, <HI>the world,</HI> that they are every where in scripture plainly and expressly distinguished from <HI>the world.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John xv.</NOTE> <HI>If ye were of the world,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>the world would love its own; but because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. But let the scripture itself speak, what world Christ died for.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6—10.</NOTE> <HI>When we were yet without strength, Christ died for the ungodly. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</HI> From all which we may clearly see, that Christ died for the world of the ungodly, for the world of sinners, for the world of his enemies; the just one for the world of the unjust. But the elect, as elect, are not unjust. Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; but even for that world St. John speaks of, when he says, "The whole world lieth in wickedness."</P>
<P N="21">21. If it be said, "The elect were sinners once as well oth∣ers:" I answer, true; but not as they are elect in Christ, but as they were out of Christ, without hope and without God
<PB N="16" REF="029479_0015_0FE13B7D1B016038"/>in the world. Therefore, to say that Christ died for the elect, as elect, is absolute nonsense and confusion.</P>
<P N="22">22. To put this matter out of doubt, I would commend these following considerations to all sober-minded men.</P>
<P N="1">1. The scripture saith, "Christ came to seek and to save that which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ost."</P>
<P>But the elect, as elect, were not lost.</P>
<P>Therefore Christ died not for the elect, as or because they were elect; for that had been to seek and save what was found and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The scripture saith, Christ died for the unjust.</P>
<P>But the elect, as such, are not unjust.</P>
<P>Therefore, Christ died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to justify them who were just before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The scripture saith, "He came to preach deliverance to the captives."</P>
<P>But the elect, as elect, are not captives; for Christ ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> set them free.</P>
<P>Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to set them at liberty who were at liberty before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The scripture saith, "He quickeneth them who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dead in trespasses and sins, such as were without Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieus from the common wealth of Israel, and strangers to the cove∣nant of promise, without hope and without God in the world.</P>
<P>But the elect, as such, are not dead in trespasses and sins, but alive unto God. Neither are they without Christ; for they are chosen in him; nor are they aliens from the com∣monwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenant of pro∣mise. But they are fellow-citizens with the faints, and the houshold of God.</P>
<P>Therefore Christ died not for the elect, as or because they were elect. For that had been to quicken them that were alive before, and to bring them into covenant, who were in covenant before. And thus, by these means account our Lord lost his labour of love, and accomplished A SOLEMN NOTHING.</P>
<P N="23">23. Thus having shewn the grievous folly of those who say, that Christ died for none but the elect. I shall now prove by undeniable reasons, that he died for all mankind.</P>

</LIST>
<P N="24">24. I shall now briefly shew the dreadful absurdities that follow from saying Christ died only for the elect.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If Christ died not for all, then unbelief is no sin in them that finally perish? seeing there is not any thing for those men to believe unto salvation, for whom Christ died not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If Christ died not for all, then it would be a sin in the greatest part of mankind to believe he died for them; seeing it would be to believe a lie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If Christ died not for those that are damned, then they are not damned for unbelief. Otherwise, you say, that they are damned for not believing a lie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If Christ died not for all, then those who obey Christ by going and preaching the gospel to every creature, as glad ti∣dings of grace and peace, of great joy to all people, do sin thereby, in that they go to most people with a lie in their mouth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. If Christ died not for all men, then God is not in earnest in calling all men every where to repent; for what good could repentance do those, for whom Christ died not?</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If Christ died not for all, then why does he say he is not willing any should perish? Surely he is willing, yea, resolv∣ed that most men should perish; else he would have died for them also.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. How shall God judge the world by the man Christ Jesus, if Christ did not die for the world? Or how shall he judge them according to the gospel, when there was never any gos∣pel or mercy for them?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="25">25. But, say some, "If Christ died for all, why are not all saved!"</P>
<P>I answer, Because they believe not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Because God called, and they re∣fused
<PB N="18" REF="029479_0017_0FE13B88BAB5D8A0"/>to answer; he stretched out his hand, and they regard∣ed not; he counselled them, but they would none of his counsels; he reproved them, but they set at nought all his reproofs; they followed after lying vanities, and forsook their own mercies; they denied the Lord that bought them, and so brought upon themselves swift destruction; and be∣cause they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved, therefore (if you would know wherefore) God gave them up to believe a lie, and to be damned. How often (saith our Lord) would I have gathered you together, and ye would not. Ye would not. Here is the plain reason, why all men are not saved. For God promiseth no man salvation, whether he will or no; but, leaveth them to everlasting de∣struction, who will not believe and obey the gospel.</P>
<P N="26">26. "O, then you are an Arminian! You are a free-willer, You hold free-will in man!"</P>
<P>I hold nothing but what the scripture saith; and that you shall give me leave to hold. I do not hold, that any man has any will or power of himself to do any thing that is good; but by the grace of God we may do all things. I have alrea∣dy shewn, he hath given Christ for all men. And he who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things? And what man knoweth not that if he make use of all the will and pow∣er God hath given him, God will double his talent and give him more? If any therefore desire to have more, let him faithfully improve what he has. Likewise what man is he, who doth not know that he is not condemned for not doing what he could not do, but for leaving undone what he could have done if he would. Let any man deny it if he can.</P>
<P N="27">27. "What, then, may all men be saved if they will?</P>
<P>Before I answer this question directly, I shall shew that those who ask it, are themselves compelled to grant as much freedom of will, as we desire to plead for.</P>
<P>For 1. The Assembly of Divines, in their confession of Faith, c. 9. do expressly say, God "hath endowed the will of man with that natural liberty that it is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity determined to do good or evil."— 2. Mr. Baxter, in the preface of his call to the unconverted, says, "That Calvin as well as Arminius, held free-will, and that no man of brains denieth, that man hath a will that is naturally free; it is free from violence, it is a self-determin∣ing principle." Sure here is as much said for free-will, as any man need to say, and perhaps more. For,</P>
<P>The difference between us, is this. They say, "Man hath a will which is naturally free." We say, "Man hath this freedom of will, not naturally, but by grace."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029479_0018_0FE13BB56C8C57B8"/>
We believe, that in the moment Adam fell, he had no freedom of will left; but that God, when of his own free grace he gave the promise of a Saviour to him and his poster∣ity, graciously restored to mankind a liberty and power to accept of proffered salvation. And in all this, man's boasting is excluded; the whole of that which is good in him, even from the first moment of his will, being of grace and not of nature. And now we come directly to the question, whether all men may be saved if they will?</P>
<P N="28">28. To those who have considered what has been premised; I answer, 1. What should hinder them, if they be willing? For, 2. God is not willing that any should perish; yea, 3. He is willing that all men should be saved. And Christ is willing; for he "came not to judge the world, but to save the world." And how did he weep over Jerusalem! How often would he have gathered them together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they would not? And now that hinders men's salvation, but that same, <HI>they would not.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. They would not; they will not come at Christ's call, and hearken to his reproof, and wait for his counsels, and receive power from on high to live to him who died for them, walking in all his commandments and ordinances blameless, and following him whithersoever he goeth. This way is so narrow that few care to walk therein, and therefore they are not saved even because <HI>they reject the counsel of God against them∣selves.</HI> They chose death; therefore they perish everlastingly.</P>

<P>And do you think that Reprobation, at least, is grounded on God's fore-knowing Man's Sins?</P>

<P>No indeed.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">ibid. c. 13. s. 6.</NOTE> <HI>God of his own good Pleasure ordains that many should be born, who are from the Womb devoted to inevitable Damnation. If any Man pretend that God's Fore-knowledge lays them under no necessity of being damn'd, but rather that he decreed their Damnation, because he foreknew their wickedness; I grant that God's Fore-knowledge alone lays no Necessity on the Creature; but eternal Life and Death depend on the Will rather than the Fore-know∣ledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God. If God only fore-knew all. Things that relate to all Men, and did not decree and ordain them also, then it might be en∣quired whether or no his fore-knowledge necessitates the Thing fore-known. But seeing he therefore fore-knows all Things that will come to pass, because he has decreed they shall come to pass, it is vain to contend about Fore-knowledge, since it is plain all Things come to pass by God's positive Decree.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is true <HI>Turkish</HI> Doctrine, and ought so to be exploded as that used to be in these Words:</P>
<P>"I do anathematize the Blasphemy of <HI>Mahomed,</HI> which saith, that God deceiveth whom he will, and whom he will he dealeth to that which is Good.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay our Doctrine is more ancient than <HI>Mahomed.</HI> It was maintain'd by <HI>St. Augustine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Augustine</HI> speaks sometimes for it, and sometimes against it. But all Antiquity for the four first Centuries is against you, as is the whole Eastern Church to this Day; and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both in her Catechism, Articles and Homiles. And so are divers of our most holy Martyrs, Bish∣op <HI>Hooper</HI> and Bishop <HI>Latimer</HI> in particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not Antiquity say, <HI>Judas</HI> was predestinated to damnation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the Contrary. St. <HI>Chrysostome's</HI> express Words are, Judas, <HI>my Beloved, was at first a Child of the Kingdom, and heard it said to him with the Disciples, "ye shall sit on Twelve Thrones." But afterwards he became a Child of Hell.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, you will own <HI>Esau</HI> was predestinated to de∣struction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I will not. Some of your own Writers be∣lieve he was finally sav'd, which was the general opinion of the ancient Fathers. And that Scripture, Jacob <HI>have I lov'd, and</HI> Esau <HI>have I hated,</HI> plainly relates not to their Persons, but their Posterities.</P>
<P>But supposing <HI>Esau</HI> or <HI>Judas</HI> to be damned, what are they damned for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without Question, for Unbelief. For as we are saved by Faith al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, so Unbelief is the only damning sin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what Faith are you saved.</P>

<P>By Faith in Christ, who gave himself for <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did he give himself for <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Judas?</HI> If not, you say, they are damned, for not believing a Lie.</P>
<P>This Consideration it was which forced Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI> to cry out.</P>
<P>"What would not a Man fly unto, rather than yield, that Christ did not die for the Reprobates; and that none but the Elect had any kind of Title to him: And yet many thousands should be bound to Conscience to believe that he died for them, and died to accept him for their Redeemer and Savior? Whereby they should have believed that which in itself is most untrue, and laid hold of that, in which they had no kind of Interest."</P>

<P>But what then do you mean by the Words <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean this. Ist. God did decree from the Begin∣ning to elect or chuse in (in Christ) all that should believe, to Salvation. And this decree proceeds from his own Goodness, and is not built upon any Goodness in the Creature. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. God did from the Beginning decree, to reprobate all who should obstinately and finally continue in Unbelief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then do you think of <HI>absolute unconditional</HI> Elec∣tion and Reprobation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it cannot be found in holy Writ, and this is a Plant which bears dismal Fruit. An instance of which we have in <HI>Calvin</HI> himself; who confesses, that he procured the burning to Death of <HI>Michael Servantus</HI> a wise and holy Man, purely for differing from him in opinion, in matters of reli∣gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why do you call <HI>Servantus</HI> a <HI>Holy Man?</HI> does <HI>not</HI> Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> himself say, that he was an <HI>Heretick,</HI> a <HI>Blasphemer,</HI> an <HI>Atheist,</HI> a <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Calvin himself</HI> does say so; and many others up∣on <HI>his</HI> Authority, who were, in effect, both Evidences, Judge and Jury against him, <HI>after</HI> his death, as well as <HI>before</HI> it.—But, you must know, I cannot wholly rely on <HI>his</HI> Authority, any more than <HI>theirs,</HI> who only retail <HI>his</HI> words. I require fuller Evidence, a more impartial Jury, and a more Equita∣ble Judge than Him, who had no more compassion on his fel∣low servant, than he supposed God to have on Infants of a Span long.</P>
