<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS XVI. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"And when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another, it is <HI>MANNA,</HI> for they wist not what it was. And <HI>Moses</HI> said unto them, this is the bread which the <HI>Lord</HI> hath given you to eat."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE children of Israel, in their travels through the deserts of Arabia towards the land of Canaan, murmured against Moses and against the Lord because the scanty stores they brought from Egypt were nearly exhausted, and they were ignorant of the means for a new re∣cruit. In particular they wanted <HI>bread.</HI> They were gratified by a miraculous providential sup∣ply. Bread was granted them—BREAD FROM HEAV∣EN! mysterious in its origin and character, but highly agreeable in its relish, salutary in its na∣ture and nutritive in its qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032229_0005_0FF19BF56736BDF8"/>
THERE are circumstances, connected with its bestowment and reception, deserving our par∣ticular notice; and the subject will lead to some reflections applicable to the society on whose ac∣count we assemble. With this view I propose the following method.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. TO consider what notice was taken by the Israelites of the provision and refreshment, divinely furnished them;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly. SHEW what it really was; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly. APPLY the subject to the present oc∣casion, by enquiring what is said of <HI>Free Masonry</HI> by those who know not what it is, and by de∣scribing its real nature and character.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>WE are, <HI>first</HI> then to <HI>consider what notice was taken by the Israelites of the provision and refresh∣ment furnished them by a special divine providence in the deserts of Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>NO sooner did they see it than they cried out one to another <HI>"it is manna, it it manna,</HI> for they knew not what it was." Whether this was an exclamation of surprize, a question of curiosity, or an expression of contempt, we shall not decide. Critics and commentators seem at a loss how to understand it. One says it is <HI>this</HI> and another <HI>that,</HI> for they know not what it is.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide POLI synops. criticorum, in loc.</NOTE> However, it
<PB N="7" REF="032229_0006_0FF19BF701432690"/>is plain enough that <HI>manna,</HI> let it mean what it will, was not the proper definition nor descrip∣tion of the admirable provision.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The derivation of the word <HI>manna</HI> is variously given by learned men. PHILO JUDAUS and JOSEPHUS make it to signify? <HI>what is this?</HI> and so do the ixx. and R. SOLOMON, R. MINACHEN, &amp; others. Accordingly it is thus translated in MATTHEW'S, the GENEVA, and DOWAY versions. It is so rendered, also, by the celebrated Dr. GEDDES. But COV∣ERDALE renders it <HI>"this is mans;"</HI> our translation, <HI>"it is manna,"</HI> and others; <HI>"it is a portion,"</HI>—The declaration that "they knew not what it was, and the reply of MOSES, would lead one to suppose that the phrase before was a <HI>question.</HI> Our only surprise is that it should afterwards pass into a descriptive <HI>name.</HI> Thus <HI>we</HI> used a very vulgar phrase in speaking of some thing of which we have forgotten the name, and say <HI>"the what do you call it."</HI></NOTE> And so Moses informed them by telling them, "this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat." Not∣withstanding, they persisted in giving their own opinion of it, tho they were unacquainted both with its name and nature.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Compare Deut. viii. 3. where Moses expressly asserts their entire ignorance of it.</NOTE>! What a strange con∣tradiction! But not stranger than all are likely to fall into who pretend to decide upon matters which they do not understand. "They said one to another it is manna;" and <HI>manna</HI> it has been called ever since. It is no easy matter to alter names. When people misjudge at first, it is
<PB N="8" REF="032229_0007_0FF19BFB52C7C8F8"/>very difficult to rectify their opinion. Igno∣rance is blind and perverse; prejudice is positive and obstinate. What is misconceived and mis∣applied seldom afterwards retrieves its real esti∣mation. Men are apt to judge at large, reflect at random and condemn at a venture; without waiting for patient examination or satisfactory evidence. Now, nothing can be more contrary both to equity and sound reason than such pre∣cipitate judgments. Those who build opinions upon conjectures must often be in the wrong. They may make gross blunders, and do great in∣justice. The apostle Jude gives such a rebuke: "These, says he, speak evil of the things they know not."—It has been the practice of vulgar ignorance to abuse what it could not compre∣hend; and to assert that there must be faults, where it had not the sagacity to discover excel∣lence.</P>
<P>I. BUT I proceed to <HI>enquire what this wonder∣ful provision really was, about which they were so ig∣norant.</HI>—That there should no doubt remain in the minds of those to whom it was sent, Moses in∣formed them that it was <HI>the bread which the Lord had given them to cat.</HI> In like manner David calls it "the corn of heaven," and "angels food."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxviii. 24, 25. See also its true name in <HI>Nehe∣miah</HI> ix. 15.</NOTE> The
<PB N="9" REF="032229_0008_0FF19BFE43CE1348"/>Scripture describes particularly its appearance and properties, and mentions its coming down with the dew; alike the gift of refreshment from above. And it retains still its fame in the East, being called "celestial sweetmeat."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Les orientaux appellent la manne qui tomba aux He∣breux dans le Desert, la Dragée ou Consiture de la Tours Puissance, ce que les Arabes signifient par Haluat al Kod∣rat, et les Turcs par Kodret Kalvasi." HERBELOT, <HI>biblioth. Orientale.</HI> The Greeks called it <HI>acromeli, acrial honey.</HI> ATH∣RN. l. 11. &amp; DIOS. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 101.</NOTE> Nor can there be any propriety in denying to the gift its real character and intrinsic value, because its appear∣ance was not prepossessing. It is sufficient that <HI>its origin was divine, and its uses excellent.</HI> If this could not recommend it, we may expect that the best things and richest blessings will be treated with neglect or spurned with contempt.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>it possessed remarkably palatable and nu∣tritive qualities</HI> is evident both from the divine design of its bestowment, and from its use. The author of the book of Wisdom says that it so ac∣commodated itself to every one's taste as to prove agreeable to all. His words are, "thou feddest thine own people with angels food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labor; able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste. For thy sustenance
<PB N="10" REF="032229_0009_0FF19C001246FC50"/>declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and, serving to the appetite of the eater and tempered itself to every man's liking."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom xvi. 20.21.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM modern samples of this substance, as it is gathered in the East, we perceive that it has the appearance of condensed honey, and a taste of agreeable sweetness. A late celebrated travel∣ler into Arabia says, "it is used now as sugar in several dishes—it is nourishing—and when new∣ly gathered has no purgative qualities."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">NICBUHR, v 2. p. 362 <HI>of the translation</HI>—and Father PINOLO, describing that of California which falls as is sup∣posed with the dew, says, that, without the whiteness of refin∣ed sugar, it has all its sweetness.</NOTE> Its me∣dicinal effects are probably occasioned by its being left some time; in consequence of which it fo∣ments in a degree, becomes candyed, and loses its relishing taste and nutritive properties.—To the Israelites, who were obliged to consume, each day, their given portion, it afforded an agreeable, nourishing, wholesome repast; and was their principal aliment during a period of forty years.—Though liable to corruption, it did not become bad unless improperly used or unlaw∣fully abused.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exod. xvi. 20.</NOTE> And the best things are per∣verted and debased by ill usage.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032229_0010_0FF19C0498E06880"/>
IT is also worthy of remark that <HI>it had moral tendencies.</HI> It was granted in daily showers, that they might be kept in a continual thankful de∣pendance upon divine providence. It was in such small grains, and was so scattered, that they were obliged early and seasonably to begin their work of collecting it, or they would fail of a supply. Thus were they taught <HI>industry;</HI> and learned that their own endeavors were to be united to the assistance and to cooperate with the grace of GOD. And a double portion on the last day of the week, and its non-appearance on the sabbath, gave them a very striking intimation that the institution of a day of actual rest from labor was to be religiously and devoutly observed.</P>
<P>THE manner too in which it was distributed was admirably calculated to excite and encour∣age a spirit of <HI>liberality</HI> and <HI>generosity,</HI> a willing∣ness to impart to those whose industry had been less successful, or who were unable to gather for their selves: for in measuring their respective gatherings before they went to their tents, those who had collected a greater quantity than sufficed for their immediate need or use freely gave the overplus to those who had not enough. "So that he who gathered much had nothing over, &amp; he that gather∣ed little had no lack." In this sense the words are understood by the Apostle, 2 Cor. viii. 14, 15. who uses the passage as an apt illustration of his
<PB N="12" REF="032229_0011_0FF19C07A5159B48"/>most excellent argument for that happy <HI>equality,</HI> in the distribution of the good things of this life, which our mutual relation to each other and par∣ticular exigencies may requires; that he who abounds should willingly impart of his superfluity, so that he who is destitute may obtain a compe∣tent supply.</P>
<P>IT would be easy to point out the very strik∣ing resemblance which FREE MASONRY bears to the <HI>moral qualities and purposes</HI> here enumerated; but it is too obvious to need a more particular reference. I shall, therefore, go on to make one more remark, in which the analogy is also ap∣parent.</P>
<P>AFTER all, <HI>there were some things in the nature of this heavenly provision which could not easily be accounted for.</HI> Where it was <HI>prepared,</HI> and how it was <HI>made,</HI> they could not tell. There they were in the dark.—Why the same substance which melted and evaporated in the heat of the sun when it was left exposed in the field, should, only upon being brought into the tent, become of so condensed a consistence that it might be beaten to powder in a mortar or ground in a mill, and baked in an oven,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xi. 9.</NOTE> was beyond their com∣prehension. And why it should be endued with
<PB N="13" REF="032229_0012_0FF19C0A94BB0990"/>such a religious reference to the observations of the sabbath that none fell on that day, and a double quantity the day before was a circum∣stance that excited their surprize. Surprize sometimes degenerates into stupidity. Oftener than once they dispised and loathed this mira∣culous and delicious provision.</P>
<P>SUCH is the pride of the human understanding that it has no great opinion of that which it can∣not fully comprehend. Whatever has any thing of mystery in it is very likely to be slight∣ed. Though it possess all the characters of excellence, and all the recommendations of util∣ity, yet if it elude investigation and have some secret qualities "past finding out," doubt will be immediately entertained whether it be "wor∣thy of all acceptation;" And opinions propo∣gated tending to lessen its character and deny its importance.—This was the case with regard to the heavenly refreshment furnished in the wilderness to the Israelites. They valued it not because they lacked "the onions, the leeks, and garlicks of Egypt." ¡Hear their discontented sneers.! "But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xvi. 6.</NOTE> —A like spirit of disapprobation and rejection the same nation discovered of
<PB N="14" REF="032229_0013_0FF19C0C3AB772C8"/>GOD's most precious gift. They murmured at JESUS because he said, your fathers did eat man∣na in the wilderness and are dead. I am that bread of life which cometh down from Heaven, of which if a man eat he shall live forever."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 41, 51.</NOTE> They rejected the Messiah before they adverted to the divine authority of his credentials. This, and the former circumstance with which it was compared, could be only from PREJUDICE: for prejudice is a judgment formed before hand without examination. How unreasonable and unjust must such a judgment be!<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Qui statuit aliquid, parte inaudita altera,</L>
<L>Aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus erit."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Seneca in Medea.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>
And how great a bar to all after information! For, if the mind be warped by prepossessions, free enquiry into the merits of a cause is prevented. Prejudice restrains all candid interpretations of motives or principles. It discolors every object; or represents it in a false light. It leads to a decision equally ungenerous and unfair; for it often presumes to consider the most slight and frivolous circumstances as satisfactory materials for consident assertion and decisive sen∣tence. It is the immediate and copious source of evil surmises and unkind suspicions. It gives rise to a caviling censoriousness, mean insinua∣tions,
<PB N="15" REF="032229_0014_0FF19C0E0EF41060"/>and sarcastic sneers.—Wherever there is a secret bias of mind previously formed, it will catch readily at every little incident and appear∣ance to increase its own propension: and turn every current of observation into its own corrupt channel.—It perverts and misrepresents the very best things: turns honor into disgrace, merit in∣to mischief, christianity into superstition, and virtue into vice.</P>
<P>CAUTIONED and instrusted by our subject, and the remarks which it has suggested, let us not, MY HEARERS, form our opinion either of persons or things too hastily; and never proceed upon sur∣mises and precarious conjectures. There is dan∣ger in making up a precipitate judgment. Hasty conclusions are the chief cause of all our mistakes and errors. Let us not forget to examine be∣fore we judge; and to understand before we de∣cide. To ridicule things we never took pains to enquire into, would be unfair. To condemn practices, the grounds and foundation of which we never examined and know nothing about. would be unjust and cruel. A discreet person will avoid being preremptory in his remarks, and decline hazarding an opinion upon that of which he is either totally ignorant, or but partially informed. He follows the prudent counsel of
<PB N="16" REF="032229_0015_0FF19C1697FFB8F8"/>the antient Wise Man; "blame not before thou hast examined the truth. Understand first, and then rebuke. Answer not before thou hast heard the cause; and strive not in a matter that con∣cerneth thee not."—"He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him."—Upon the same principle of equity is that maxim in Common Law, "every man is presum∣ed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty." No one is to be arraigned without evidence, nor condemned before he has made his plea of de∣fence. Verdict is never passed upon a cause un∣heard.</P>
<P>It is a good rule in all doubtful matters to suspend our opinion, at least till positive proof is obtained on which to found it. Until we have fully ascertained the real state of the case, let us always be willing to put the fairest construction it will admit; and even to hope the best of a thing where appearances are against it. Where <HI>doubt</HI> hesitates, let <HI>candor</HI> prompt; and where <HI>justice</HI> balances let <HI>mercy</HI> prevail. Even where we find ourselves obliged to blame the principles of a certain sect or party, let us not be so uncharitable as to confound all its adherents and followers under one general indiscriminate censure. Es∣pecially let us not charge them with such conse∣quences of their tenets as they disavow.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032229_0016_0FF19C34D4645640"/>
<HI>Lastly:</HI> WHERE we know but in part, and see but in part, we will have the modesty not to presume to decide upon the whole. Carefully will we avoid all prejudice, and all asperity of opinion. We will be kind and liberal both in sentiment and conduct; encourage in ourselves and approve in others whatever tends to promote the interests of mankind and contribute to the refreshment of life; and will humbly hope by the exercise of amiable dispositions and beneficent actions towards each other, sanctified &amp; perfected by piety towards GOD, to become prepared for that glorious society on high, where we shall be per∣mitted to eat of the HIDDEN MANNA, and honor∣ed also with the possession of the WHITE STONE in which is the new and mysterious name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revel. ii, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt the longer upon this part of the subject because from <HI>prejudice,</HI> as well as from <HI>ignorance,</HI> arise most of the objections against FREE MASONRY, and all the misrepresentations of its principles and practices. As the origin of such dislike to our institution is so well known, it might be deemed paying too great respect to its cavils to take any notice of them at all: but,
<PB N="18" REF="032229_0017_0FF19C18253C0B20"/>lest it should be thought that we are desirous of evading an answer from an inability to vindicate, we shall now condescend, as was proposed.</P>
<P N="3">III, TO <HI>inquire what is said of</HI> FREE MASONRY <HI>by those who "know not what it is."</HI></P>
<P>THE opinion of the initiated is well known. They all unite in commending the Society with a warmth that borders upon enthusiasm. They discover an attachment to it, at which <HI>ignorance</HI> wonders and <HI>prejudice</HI> sneers.</P>
<P>ONE of the most frequent objections urged against FREE MASONRY is <HI>"the profound secrecy observed upon certain parts of the institution."</HI> It is queried how it is consistent with those principles of good will we profess, to conceal any thing from the world. We answer, that, to the wise and virtuous the arcana of the Craft, under prop∣er sanctions, are freely communicated. But to reveal them to the ignorant and vicious would be prostituting their purpose and profaning their sanctity. To divulge them in common would be to annihilate the society: because they are its distinguishing features, the character∣ristics of the order, and the means of its preser∣vation. Without them, therefore, it could not subsist.—Besides, were all men acquainted with them, without regard to selection or desert, <HI>the
<PB N="19" REF="032229_0018_0FF19C19B5F16708"/>peculiar obligation to good offices</HI> arising from the institution would revert back to the general duty of all mankind, and be subject to all those de∣ductions it now meets with in the world at large, and against which it is our first principle to guard.—</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to have secrets is not peculiar to FREE MASONRY. Every trade, every art, and every occupation, has its secrets, not to be communicated but to such as have become proficients in the science connected with them, nor then but with proper caution and restriction; and oftentimes under the guard of heavy pen∣alties. Charters of incorporation are granted by civil Governments for their greater security, and patents for their encouragement.—Nay every Government, every statesman, and every individ∣vidual, has secrets, which are concealed with prudent care, and confided only in the trusty and true.</P>
<P>NOTHING more surely, need be said in apol∣ogy for the mystery and concealment FREE MASONS profess.—I will proceed to another objection allied to the foregoing, which <HI>igno∣rance</HI> also has surmised and <HI>prejudice</HI> prop∣agated.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032229_0019_0FF19C1B5BE309C0"/>
IT is pretended that <HI>"all who are initiated must swear to conceal certain secrets before they are communicated to them, or they have it in their power to examine their nature and tendency: and that this practice is unlawful."</HI> There would be some force in this objection were the obligation in itself immoral, or the communications &amp; requirements compatible with the great laws of religion or civil society: the very reverse of which is the case.</P>
<P>WHAT the ignorant call "the oath" is simply an obligation, covenant, and promise, exacted previously to the divulging of our means of recog∣nizing each other, that they shall be kept from the knowledge of the world, lest their original intent should be thwarted and their benevolent purport prevented.—Now? pray what harm is there in this?? Do you not all, when you have any thing of a private nature which you are willing to confide in a particular friend <HI>before you tell him what it is,</HI> demand a solemn promise of secrecy? And,? is there not the utmost propri∣ety in knowing whether your friend is deter∣mined to conceal your secret <HI>before</HI> you presume to reveal it? Your answer confutes your cavil.—</P>
<P>IT is further urged against FREE MASONS that <HI>"Their society is not founded on universal
<PB N="21" REF="032229_0020_0FF19C1F9F327340"/>benevolence, because they oblige their selves to be kind∣est and most generous to their own members."</HI> We ad∣mit the truth of the declaration that our first and choicest services are paid to our brethren: but then we think it would be the greatest in∣justice if it were otherwise. Certainly a dis∣crimination ought to be made between the deserv∣ing and the underserving; those who have a claim upon our assistance and charity, and those who have not. So the Apostle exhorts the Christians to do good as they have opportunity to all men; but enjoins their special and distinguishing re∣gards to such as are of the household of faith.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. vi. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>YET though we give a decided preference to such as have been tried, and proved, and found to be worthy; and have, in consequence, been made members of the masonic family; we are known to profess and practice charity unconfined and liberality unlimited, and to comprehend in the wide circle of our benevolence the whole human race.</P>
<P>IT is, also, frequently argued against FREE MASONRY that <HI>"some of those who belong to it are intemperate, profligate, and vicious."</HI> But nothing can be more unfair or unjust than to depreciate or condemn any institution, good in itself, on ac∣count
<PB N="22" REF="032229_0021_0FF19C22983622A8"/>of the faults of those who pretend to ad∣here to it. The abuse of a thing is no valid ob∣jection to its inherent goodness. Worthless characters are to be found, occasionally, in the very best institutions upon earth. "If the un∣worthiness of a professor casts a reflection upon the profession, it may be infered, by parity of reason, that the misconduct of a christian is an argument against christianity. But this, is a conclusion which, I presume, no man will allow; and yet it is no more than what <HI>he</HI> must subscribe who is so unreasonable as to insist on the other."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the excellent sermon of the Rev. Brother BROCK∣WELL, preached at Boston, 1749.</NOTE> Nor is it any evidence that Civil Laws and Polit∣ical Institutions are hurtful or unserviceable be∣cause there are corrupt citizens and disorderly members of a community.</P>
<P>THE fact is, the best things may be abused. The <HI>bread of heaven</HI> grew corrupt when used in∣discretely. The common blessings of life are turned into curses if misapplied.</P>
<P>WHEN you see base and unworthy men among the FREE MASONS, depend upon it, the fault is not in the Institution, but in their selves. They have deviated from the principles of the
<PB N="23" REF="032229_0022_0FF19C2428840E18"/>Craft. They have counteracted their profession: and are as bad masons as men.</P>
<P>WE do not hesitate to appeal to the world in justifi∣cation of the purity of our moral system. Our <HI>Con∣stitutions</HI> are well known. We have submitted them freely to general investigation. We sol∣emnly avouch them as the principles by which we are governed, the foundation on which we build, and the rules by which we work. We challenge the most severe critic, the most precise moralist, the most perfect christian, to point out any thing in them inconsistent with good man∣ners, fair morals, or pure religion. We feel as∣sured that every one who will take pains to con∣sult the book must be convinced that the institution is friendly to the best interests of mankind, well calculated to meliorate the disposition &amp; improve the human character, &amp; to adorn its faithful adher∣ents with every natural, social and religious virtue.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THIS remark leads me to shew as I pro∣posed, in the last place, <HI>what</HI> FREE MASONRY <HI>real∣ly is.</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>a moral order</HI> of enlightened men, found∣ed on a sublime, rational, and manly PIETY, and pure and active VIRTUE; with the praise-worthy design of recalling to our remembrance the most interesting truths in the midst of the most sociable
<PB N="24" REF="032229_0023_0FF19C28B3253F18"/>&amp; innocent pleasures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—"miscuit utile dulci,</L>
<L>—delectando, pariterque monendo."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Horace,</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>
&amp; of promoting, without ostentation, or hope of reward, the most diffusive BENEVOLENCE, the most generous and extensive PHILANTHROPY, and the most warm and affec∣tionate BROTHERLY LOVE. The members are united together by particular obligations, and ac∣quainted by certain <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>tokens</HI> preserved with inviolable secrecy from remotest ages. These were originally adopted in order to distinguish one another with ease and certainty from the rest of the world; that imposters might not intrude upon their confidence and brotherly affection, nor intercept the fruits of their beneficence. They become <HI>an universal linguage,</HI> by which a brother in distress in a foreign country may make his self understood to such of the Society there as could relieve and protect him. The <HI>decora∣tions</HI> and <HI>symbols</HI> of the Craft which are those of a very common and useful art,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ARCHITECTURE.</NOTE> and their <HI>prase-ology,</HI> which is borrowed from its higher orders, serve to characterize an institution which might justly claim more noble devices; and at the same time are used either as emblems or indications of the simplest and most important MORAL TRUTHS.</P>

IT collects men of all nations and opinions into one amiable and permanent association, and binds them by new and irrefragable obligations to the discharge of every relative and moral duty: and thus becomes the most effectual support and brightest ornament of social life, and opens a wi∣der channel for the current of benevolent affec∣tions, and a new source to human happiness.</P>
<P>ITS laws are REASON, EQUITY; its <HI>principles,</HI> BENEVOLENCE, LOVE; and its <HI>religion,</HI> PURITY and TRUTH. Its <HI>intention</HI> is PEACE ON EARTH; and its <HI>disposition,</HI> GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN.</P>
<P>"I THINK (says a fine writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. DR. MILNE, Grand Chaplain, in a sermon be∣fore the Grand Lodge of England, 1788.</NOTE>) we are war∣ranted in concluding that a Society thus consti∣tuted, and which may be rendered so admirable an engine of improvement, far from meriting any reproachful or contumelious treatment, de∣serves highly of the community; and that the ridicule and affected contempt which it has some∣times experienced can proceed only from ignor∣ance or from arrogance; from those; in sine, whose opposition does it honor, whose censure is panegyric, and praise would be censure."</P>
<P>ASSUREDLY then, my hearers, you will with
<PB N="26" REF="032229_0025_0FF19C2EAF807DF0"/>me congratulate the members of SR. PAUL's lodge on the agreeable event of this day.</P>
<P>RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MASTER, WOR∣SHIPFUL WARDENS, RESPECTED OF∣FICERS, AND BELOVED BRETHREN.</P>
<P>ACCEPT my affectionate salutations—accept the felicitations of all the friends of Masonry. We are pleased with your harmony and zeal, and rejoice in your establishment and prosperity. Your success is connected with the best interests of humanity.! May the social virtues you culti∣vate and the heart-felt pleasures you experience in the lodge, be your companions through life! Their mild influence, their benignant spirit, will animate every scene of duty, alleviate every cor∣rosion of care, heighten every sensation of joy, and in the hour of dissolution shed divine trans∣port on your souls.</P>
<P>LET <HI>all my brethren present</HI> be willing that I should remind them that in vain do we attempt the vindication of our most excellent Society, or the commendatory description of its purposes and requirements, if our conduct contradict our profession. Let us then be cautious to avoid all those improprieties and vices which might tarnish
<PB N="27" REF="032229_0026_0FF19C30406CE6E8"/>the lustre of our jewels, or diminish the credit of the Craft. Masonry will rise to the zenith of its glory if our lives do justice to its noble principles, and the world see that our actions hold an uni∣form and entire correspondence with the incom∣parable tenets we profess. Thus we shall "ob∣tain a good report of them that are without:" "and those who speak evil of us will be ashamed, seeing they falsely accuse our good conversation" and misrepresent our generous purpose. "For so is the will of GOD that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men."</P>
<P>REMEMBER that we are THE ASSOCIATED FRIENDS OF HUMANITY; that our sacred union embraces in its philanthrophy amities of the Gos∣pel; and that charity in its kindest exercise and largest extent is our distinguishing characteristic. Others wear the warmth of summer in their face, and the coldness of winter in their heart; but a Mason's <HI>disposition</HI> should be mild as the breeze, open as the air, and genial as the sun—cheering and blessing all around him: and his <HI>deeds</HI> pleas∣ant as the clear shining after the rain; and re∣freshing, as the dewy cloud in a harvest day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. XVIII. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>MAY <HI>the Assembly at large</HI> be convinced that prejudicies against FREE MASONRY are ill found∣ed,
<PB N="28" REF="032229_0027_0FF19C31D761F640"/>and that the Society is worthy of the highest encouragement and the warmest commendation.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>"All VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS that are harmless to the Public, may justly claim the <HI>protection</HI>—if beneficial to it, the <HI>encouragement</HI> of the Citizens and Laws."</P>
<BIBL>WISHART.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>FINALLY; let us all pray that the priveleges of equal right may be widely extended, and all men become <HI>free:</HI> that wars and contentions may be forever terminated: that peace and happiness may be the uninterrupted enjoyment of all mankind: and to GOD ascend the universal; united; uncea∣sing ascription of love and joy and praise!</P>
<P><HI>So mote it be!</HI></P>
