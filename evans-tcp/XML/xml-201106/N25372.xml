<HEAD>A CAUTION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE States are at present exposed to very threatening dangers. Whether <HI>France</HI> has been justly provoked by the con∣duct of the late President and his successor, or by the temper that placed the last in his station, will not now be enquired. The <HI>fact</HI> is, that <HI>France</HI> is provoked. What the consequences of her re∣sentment may be, demands our most serious consideration.</P>
<P>She still believes, that a great body of <HI>American</HI> citizens, re∣gards her and the cause in which she is engaged, with the warm∣est affection. She believes rightly: But it is possible, and pro∣bable too—that a single manoeuvre of our <HI>constituted authorities</HI> may convince her, that the nation is hostile to her and her cause; and this conviction may instantly snap the thread, by which a naked sword is suspended over our head.</P>
<P>SOME MANOEUVRE OF THIS KIND IS MEDITATED: But, a hope is entertained, that even the obstinacy attendant upon littleness of genius, so dull in distinguishing between wisdom and passions, the rashness of short-sighted policy, the mouth-filling selfishness of office-seeking orators, and the blinding vanity of youthful fri∣volists, that fiddles in declamations amidst the flames of their country, will at length give way to dictates of PRUDENCE, if not of patriotism.</P>
<P>"The film removed"—"the seat of mental sight" may then perhaps distinctly discern the important objects that claim in∣stant attention—</P>
<P>"And, IT HAS MUCH TO SEE."</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> attacked by combined <HI>Europe,</HI> are trium∣phant. Other controversies are settled; and the war that lately spread so wide, is contracted, with dispositions apparently ir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>concileable, to a dreadful struggle between the Republic and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></P>

The Executive Directory have proclaimed their resolution to "CONQUER" <HI>Britain,</HI> and are preparing the means for carrying that resolution into effect.</P>
<P>To the accomplishment of this design, the Republic is stimu∣lated by three of the most exciting motives, that ever agitated the mind of a people. First—to humble a rival, that for many centuries has been formidable and hurtful; and in the revolu∣tion, has been the principal instigator and supporter of the co∣alition, that aimed destruction at her territorial integrity and national liberty; and therefore, in her account is justly charge∣able with all the <HI>French</HI> blood that has been shed, and all the <HI>French</HI> treasure that has been expended.</P>
<P>Secondly—to obtain compensation for the injuries that have been sustained. The vast debts incurred by the Republic, and due to their meritorious armies and other deserving creditiors, must be paid, and EITHER BY FRANC OR BRITAIN.</P>
<P>Thirdly—to extinguisn the <HI>British</HI> domination over the oceans; thus to become the deliverers of mankind from an oppressive despotism on that element, and then by an enlightened and hu∣mane policy, to promote permanent peace, and a friendly in∣tercourse amongst nations, and build their fame and happiness, on the solid foundations of benefactions to the human race.—There is reason to believe, that their philanthropy means to ex∣tend effectual relief, to those outcasts of modern mercies, the weeping—bleeding children of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>

<P>These Islands therefore, not to mention others, have a com∣manding position with respect to GREECE.</P>
<P>The scenes illustrated by the brightest splendors of human genius, and signalized by memorable changes in human affairs, seem to be peculiarly suited to the temper and destination of the Republic.</P>
<P>When we consider the impressions that must be made on FRENCH MINDS by seeing the birth place of heroes and sages, the unequalled cultivatrix of Science and Arts, the undaunted asserter, tho' encom∣passed by hostile despots, of the Rights of Man, and the cradle of Republicanism, groaning under barbaric ignorance and inso∣lence, can we suppose, that <HI>France</HI> will be satisfied, unless she communicates the blessings she enjoys, to that country, from which through the long la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f ages and the ceaseless contention of eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, she has received THE SACRED TRAIN OF THOUGHT, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wrought out her own amazing deliverance.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="033647_0005_0FF7B821001BDCD0"/>height of true glory, than any people upon earth ever attained.</P>
<P>Instead of imitating the <HI>Roman</HI> policy, of settling colonies among conquered nations, to enforce their subjection, <HI>France</HI> more generously and more wisely, waves her enfranchising hand over their heads, and with the voice of power and humanity bids them rise up FREE STATES. THE FRIEND OF MANKIND, she be∣stows Liberty upon them; and in return asks only their amity. She is their <HI>political parent;</HI> and if ever they fail in rendering to her the filial duty they owe her, well will they deserve to sink again into their former abject condition.</P>
<P>How much farther the triumphs of benevolence may extend, it is not difficult to foresee. A short well-improved passage from the head of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to the head of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> may open a facility of communication with the <HI>East Indies,</HI> by a rout about one third as long as that by the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>Let any one recollect the wonderful grandeur and wealth to which, the <HI>Arabians,</HI> the first traders by sea to the <HI>East,</HI> the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and in more modern times, the <HI>Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se</HI> and the <HI>Venitians,</HI> rose, by the profits of their traffic, carried on by every one of these nations, in the very course here alluded to, and it will be evident, that the Republic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>specially having a good understanding with the neighbouring <HI>Arabians,</HI> easily attainable by communicating to them a portion of former benefits, may amply partake of the incomputable ad∣vantages ever flowing from that inexhaustible source.</P>
<P><HI>Russia,</HI> hereditarily hostile to <HI>France,</HI> and lately JEALOUS OF HER BENIGNANT POLICY, has openly aimed at the navigation of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> through the <HI>Bespherus,</HI> and at more than that navigation. She is to be anticipated.</P>
<P>The Commerce of <HI>France</HI> may be more extensive, more benefi∣cial, and more firmly fixed, than that of any state that ever ex∣isted. If she shall fully imbibe <HI>the spirit of her fortunes,</HI> more like the sun than her emblemati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts ever thought, she will rise to onlighten, warm, and bless the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rth.</P>
<P>What power upon the Globe can prevent this exaltation? None, but the <HI>British</HI> maritime dominion. <HI>France</HI> then, to the utmost exertion of all her hitherto-irresistable energies, will strike at that dominion.</P>
<P>"True!" it will be said: "But, what will her utmost exer∣tion signify, against the vast superiority of <HI>British</HI> Fleets? It is granted, that her land force is greater than that of <HI>Britain;</HI> but, it is <HI>impossible,</HI> that she can transport an army sufficient to make much impression on that kingdom."</P>
<P>If we count upon this <HI>supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed impossibility</HI> as a <HI>cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>
<PB N="7" REF="033647_0006_0FF7B82547EFFF68"/>direct our conduct by such a persuasion, we may fall into a fa∣tal deception. We cannot be too CAUTIOUS in our calculations upon that subject.</P>
<P>Some persons indeed among us, speak of the naval power of <HI>Britain</HI> as invincible, and in a manner as everlasting. But these ebulitions seem to be suggested by passion, peculiar interests, and particular predilections, that have latterly introduced a great deal of fanciful speculations in polities, and concerning measures that involve our best welfare.</P>
<P>These speculations, like some of other kinds, after amusing the adventurers with golden prospects for months or years, bring upon them heavy responsibilities, before the maturation of their alchymistical materials can be completed. We see enough al∣ready, to be convinced, that the whole projection is vanishing into air—"into thin air".</P>
<P>In contemplating HOW <HI>France</HI> can invade <HI>Britain,</HI> it is appre∣hended, that the true question is not—Whether the former, with the assistance of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> will be able send out such Fleets, as by successive engagements will acquire the dominion of the ocean—but, whether in existing circumstances, <HI>France</HI> will be able to send into <HI>Britain,</HI> across the narrow sea that se∣parates them, such an army as will absolutely prescribe the terms of peace.</P>
<P>However, let us make some reflections on the first question.</P>
<P>When <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> were contending for Empire, if not for safety, <HI>Rome</HI> had no ships of war, and did not know how to build them. <HI>Carthage</HI> had been for ages mistress of the seas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After all her losses in the two preceding contests, <HI>Catha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> at the begin∣ning of her <HI>last</HI> fatal war, alone contained <HI>seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> inhabitants, and ruled over <HI>three bunished</HI> cities.
<P>How enormous must he power have been at the commencement of the <HI>se∣cond</HI> or <HI>Hann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>balie</HI> war? What then must have been the undaunted courage of <HI>Rome.</HI> that dared to encounter this power? And want her pros and policy. that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> she adhered to it, with such insuperable patience, that after losing <HI>seven bazdrea</HI> men of war, the at last prevailed.</P></NOTE> In the conclusion, after many battles by sea, and a war of more than twenty years continuance, the <HI>Romans</HI> were conquerors at sea, as well as at land. The resources of the two parties were much nearer to an equality, than those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI> now are.</P>
<P>The predecessor of <HI>Alfred</HI> the great, "lest his subjects and successors in the most dangerous and distressful circumstances". The afflicted nation seemed likely to perish: and that truly great Prince was obliged for some time to conceal himself from his enemies in deep retirement. At length he left his retreat, and
<PB N="8" REF="033647_0007_0FF7B826D75FB420"/>had many conflicts with the <HI>Danes,</HI> who covered as it were the neighbouring seas with their fleets, and were continually and cruelly harrassing <HI>England</HI> with invasions. The King was very sensible of the disadvantages his subjects laboured under, for want of a sufficient fleet to meet their enemies at sea, and pre∣vent their landing, and was very desirous of supplying that de∣fect.</P>
<P>"But (says a judicious historian) there is nothing in the world more difficult, than to restore a naval power when it is fallen into decay, in a country where there is little trade, to furnish ships, and to be a nursery for seamen; and in the face of ene∣mies who are masters of the sea. To an <HI>ordinary genius,</HI> this must appear impracticable. What admiration then is justly due to that extraordinary Prince, who not only attempted, but <HI>ac∣complished</HI> that difficult undertaking; who raised a <HI>mighty</HI> naval power <HI>almost out of nothing,</HI> revived foreign trade, and <HI>wrested</HI> the dominion of the seas out of the hands of the insulting <HI>Danes?</HI> This was the great <HI>Alfred,</HI> who presents himself in so many ami∣able points of view, to one who studies the <HI>Anglo-Saxon</HI> history, that it is impossible not to contract the fondest and most enthu∣siastic admiration of his character."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry's Hist. of Pritain, II. 403-40<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>In another place the historian takes notice, that "<HI>Alfred,</HI> to oppose the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleets, commanded ships to be built of <HI>a new construction.</HI> They were of about twice the length of the former, and much more lofty; which made them much swifter sailers, more steady in the water, and not so apt to roll. Some of these new vessels had sixty oars, and some even more."</P>
<P>If we compare the <HI>French</HI> with either of the before mentioned powers, it will be found, that they will have much less difficul∣ty to contend with, for obtaining the dominion of the seas, than the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Anglo-Saxons</HI> had.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to the second question.</P>
<P>The first reflection that offers itself to consideration on this head, is the prodigious disproportion of <HI>population</HI> and <HI>native strength</HI> between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> not to insist on the momen∣tous addition to that disproportion by the <HI>allies</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> two of the greatest maritime powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> excited as they must be to the most ardent co-operation with her, by the vast pledges they have dependant on the issue, and by the proofs she has given in her late negociations, that she contends for <HI>their</HI> inter∣acts as pertinaciously as for her own—while <HI>Britain</HI> is left alone.</P>
<P>The next reflection that presents itself, is the relative situation of the two countries.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033647_0008_0FF7B82BBA33B050"/>
From <HI>Brest</HI> directly opposite to <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the <HI>Texel</HI> opposite to <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk, France</HI> has these interme∣diate ports, well adapted for fitting out large armaments—<HI>Cher∣burgh, Havre, Saint Vallori,</HI> with the river <HI>Boulogne,</HI> and <HI>Ostend.</HI> Which of these places, and how many of them, or what others, will afford the best points for making their "dreadful notes of preparation", the skill and ingenuity of the <HI>French</HI> will deter∣mine upon principles as indisputable as geometrical axioms or mathematical demonstrations. Certain it is, that as to all of them, the winds that may be favourable to the enterprizes of <HI>France,</HI> will be adverse to her enemy. The <HI>British</HI> history abounds with instances of this kind; and not winds only may conspire to render plans of invasion successful.</P>
<P>When <HI>Allectus,</HI> the successor of the famous <HI>Carauscius</HI> reigned in <HI>Britain,</HI> he was master of the seas. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor <HI>Constantius,</HI> resolved to recover <HI>Britain,</HI> and accordingly col∣lected a very large fleet at <HI>Boulogne.</HI> Now in passing, to avoid an enemy too strong for them, was the only difficulty. A mo∣dern <HI>English</HI> historian says—"The ROMANS, under the cover of a thick fog, escaped the fleet of <HI>Allectus;</HI> and <HI>convinced</HI> the BRITONS, that <HI>a superiority of naval strength</HI> will not <HI>always</HI> pro∣tect their country from a foreign invasion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibb. Hist II. 106.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the first of <HI>November</HI> 1688, <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and soon afterwards King of <HI>England,</HI> sailed from <HI>Holland</HI> with a fleet of fifty men of war, twenty five frigates, and as many fire-ships, and near four hundred other vessels. In less than two days he was between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>The fleet of <HI>James</HI> the second, consisting of sixty one men of war, of which thirty eight were of the line of battle, lay at the <HI>Gunfleet</HI> near the <HI>Thames,</HI> to intercept the <HI>Dutch:</HI> but, the <HI>Dutch</HI> passed the <HI>Gunfleet</HI> in a very hazy day, while the winds were extremely unfavourable to the <HI>English</HI> fleet. The <HI>Dutch</HI> very deliberately coasted along all the southern parts of <HI>England,</HI> from its eastern point the <HI>North Foreland</HI> at the mouth of the <HI>Channel,</HI> to within a few miles of its westernmost County. Yet, after all the protraction of this voyage, the whole army of horse and foot was on shore, at <HI>Torbay</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> before the end of the <HI>fourth</HI> day from its beginning. "The wind prevented Lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI>" entirely devoted to <HI>James's</HI> cause, "who was <HI>come in sight of the Dutch fleet,</HI> from attacking it, and obliged him to go into <HI>Portsmouth.</HI>"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin's Hist. of England, XII. 140-145.</NOTE></P>

<P>When <HI>William</HI> surnamed the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> then only Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> designed the invasion of <HI>England</HI> and the dethrone∣ment of King <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d,</HI> "he sailed from the harbour of <HI>Saint Val∣lori</HI> at the mouth of the river <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mme,</HI> with a great fleet and gal∣lant army, on the 28th o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>September</HI> 1066, and <HI>the day after</HI> ar∣rived at <HI>Pevens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI>"—"on the 14th day of <HI>October</HI> fol∣lowing, the decisive battle of <HI>Hastings</HI> was fought,"—"and on the next <HI>Christmas</HI> day, he was crowned King of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Westminster Abbey,</HI> with all the usual ceremonies, by <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry's Hist. of Britain III. 1—6.</NOTE></P>
<P>"<HI>William</HI> the second, to suppress an insurrection in one of his continental provinces, embarked, tho' it blew a furious storm, and landed <HI>next m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning</HI> at <HI>Barfleur,</HI>" about forty miles from the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid 33</NOTE></P>
<P>"<HI>Henry</HI> the second embarked at <HI>Barfleur,</HI> on the 8th of <HI>July,</HI> and landed <HI>that evening</HI> at <HI>Southampton,</HI> bringing with him the two queens."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid 103.</NOTE></P>
<P>Afterwards, "<HI>Henry</HI> hearing of the danger of his <HI>Norman</HI> Capital, and having settled his affairs in <HI>England,</HI> embarked at <HI>Pertsmouth, August</HI> 7th, with his <HI>Brabasons,</HI> and a thousand <HI>Welch,</HI> whom he had taken into his pay,"—"and landed <HI>next day</HI> at <HI>Barfleur</HI>".<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>Several other instances of such expeditions made with equal quickness, might be enumerated. In reality <HI>the Channel</HI> is only a large ferry.</P>
<P>The motives, by which <HI>France</HI> is impelled to an invasion of <HI>Britain,</HI> are of the most imperious nature. They will bring into requisition not only all her ability and all her diligence, but—all her genius and all her knowledge.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> confess, that the <HI>French</HI> are perfect masters of na∣val architecture. If they shall not be able to collect, as soon as they wish, a sufficient number of men of war, to protect an army in its passage, probably they will supply that deficiency, by building such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting fortresses as the world has never yet seen: for, their actions in other resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, have transcended all former examples of human archievement.</P>
<P>The prize at which they now aim, is in their eyes too inesti∣mable to be abandoned. The greatness of obstacles and suffer∣ings
<PB N="11" REF="033647_0010_0FF7B839D8A9A8E0"/>will enhance its value. It is in their opinion, consecrated by the blood of their fellow-citizens that has been poured out in the cause. They will not think <HI>any thing</HI> that <HI>has been</HI> gained, is commensurate to their rights or interests. To leave <HI>Britain</HI> reigning on any element, will in their estimation be ingratitude to their brethren who are no more, and treason against their posterity. The old <HI>Roman</HI> denunciation, "DELINDA EST CAR∣THAGO," rings from the <HI>Rhine</HI> to the <HI>Pyrennees,</HI> and from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to the <HI>Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>Surely, it is within the bounds of probability, that wooden fortresses may be constructed, mounting such artillery as no first-rate can oppose with success. Unincumbered with masts sails and other rigging, and therefore drawing less water, and capable of carrying more artillery, a sufficient celerity may be given to their motion, if towed by gallies driven forward with the united force of sails and oars, especially if it be considered, that for se∣veral months in every year, the <HI>Channel</HI> is very smooth. It is likely, that <HI>Alfred</HI>'s ships of <HI>"a new construction"</HI> before men∣tioned, were as extraordinary in his age, as such fortresses would be now.</P>
<P>A knowledge of all nautical circumstances, will enable the planners of invasion, to calculate exactly the time that will be re∣quired for the arrival of the armament on the opposite shore. Proper persons raised up in baloons, and furnished with the best glasses, may discern every vessel within sight to a vast distance. The possibility and quantity of any resistance by them, can then be precisely ascertained. If intelligence from places more re∣mote is wanted, telegraphs can dart it, with any requisite ve∣locity.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his life of <HI>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</HI> says—"His great divertisement was in building gallies, and inventing engines of war; and having naturally a genius addicted to mechanics, he did not apply it to making useless toys, after the humour of some other princes, who spent their vacant hours in painting, music, or turning, &amp;c."—"But, the mechanic inventions of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> tho' designed for use and service, had something noble and mag∣nificent withall; and the wonderful contrivance of them was so uncommon, that one might easily read the character of <HI>a great mind</HI> and <HI>extraordinary genius</HI> in the artifice. They were such, as by their structure bespoke themselves the product of a sove∣reign engineer, insomuch that they did not less surprize his friends with their stupendous magnificence, than they astonished his enemies by their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> It is no less remarkable than true, what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the very enemies against
<PB N="12" REF="033647_0011_0FF7B83D9B2A25B8"/>whom they were to be employed for their destruction, could not forbear running to gaze with admiration upon his gallies of five and six ranges of oars, as they passed near their coasts; and the inhabitants of those cities that were to be besieged and stormed by those terrible engines, thronged to the walls which they were about to batter, to behold those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> machines"—"Even <HI>Ly∣simachus,</HI> of all the kings of his time the greatest enemy of <HI>De∣metrius,</HI> coming to raise the siege of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>os</HI> in <HI>Cilicia,</HI> sent to desire to see his gallies and engines, which <HI>Demetrius</HI> readily granted. <HI>Lysimachus</HI> having gratified his curiosity by a full view of them, struck at once with fear and admiration, quitted the place, and his design of relieving the besieged city."</P>
<P>The contemplation of such facts as have been mentioned, should teach, it is presumed, not to be over-confident, in de∣ciding upon the enterprizes of great minds, animated by the strongest excitements, and supported by a prodigious accumu∣lation of power, in a rapid progression of aggrandizement.</P>
<P>Our disquisitions concerning the final event of the contest be∣tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> can have no influence upon that contest; but, a just regard for our own peace and welfare, calls upon us to reflect, that the event MAY BE disastrous to the last.</P>
