<P>A PLAN WITH PROPOSALS FOR FORMING A COMPANY TO WORK MINES IN THE UNITED STATES; AND TO SMELT AND REFINE THE ORES WHETHER OF Copper, Lead, Tin, Silver, or Gold.</P>
<P>BY BENJAMIN HENFREY.</P>
<P>Is it not the interest of every citizen of America to promote the working of mines; since all that is obtained from the bowels of the earth becomes an addition to the public stock?</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I CONCEIVE that it is totally unne∣cessary for me to make any comment upon the great advantage it would be to this country to be supplied with all the useful metals from its own mines; to purchase which, an immense sum, every one knows, is annually sent to Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>Americans are an enlightened people, and ve∣ry capable of judging of what is calculated to promote the true interest of their country.</P>
<P>I therefore submit, with much deference, the following plan and proposals to their considera∣tion. It is a plan that I have taken full time to consider, and am convinced of its practicability.</P>
<P>The greatest difficulty that I see will attend it is, that mining is a business that the people in general are afraid of being concerned in.</P>
<P>I must, therefore, beg that my reader will lay aside all that sort of prejudice, while perusing the following pages; if so, his reason will, I flatter myself, be convinced, and he will see, that mining is not so dangerous a business as he may have supposed it to be.</P>
<P>The plan of forming a company with a large capital to work mines of lead, copper, coals, &amp;c.
<PB N="iv" REF="032245_0003_0FF1A3EA18BECB08"/>in the United States, is not a new idea with me.</P>
<P>Every person conversant with business is able to estimate the advantage arising from an associ∣ation of capital. Undertakings of great public as well-as private utility are, by this mode, ac∣complished with ease; and by it many valuable sources of wealth have been discovered. I will beg leave to note a few.</P>
<P>The first vessel fitted out in England for a whaling voyage was from the port of Hull, by a number of adventurers joining in the expense. Their success was great, and, in a few years, a number of ships were fitted out for that trade; and there was scarce a huxter, or even a porter, in the town, that was not concerned.</P>
<P>The plan was the same with regard to the coal-trade. Many vessels have been fitted out from Newcastle and Whitehaven, on shares even so low as £5. Similar associations with regard to shipping are very common in this country, particularly in the eastern states, where we often find, that even the men before the mast are in part owners. The advantage arising to the com∣munity is great; for these schemes give the in∣dustrious poor an opportunity of employing their little savings to advantage, which might otherwise have been spent in riot and drunken∣ness.</P>
<P>I have often, with much satisfaction, contem∣plated the good effects arising from the various associations of capital in Britain; and my reason has long been convinced that they have been, and still are, the principal sources from whence the amazing wealth of that country flow. I know
<PB REF="032245_0004_0FF1A41AC1EEB870"/>of no pursuit where an association of capital is so proper as for the purpose of working mines; for, in general, the sum required is great, and the risk considerable. Unless the vein is already discovered, the risk consists in searching for it; but there is no risk in the mines I am about to recommend, and which I shall prove by the most unquestionable testimony to be of immense value.</P>
<P>I have now been near six years in America, the greatest part of which time has been spent in making discoveries in the mineral kingdom, and in which I have been very successful. I now offer to the public a plan by which they may benefit from my researches, looking for∣ward only to a moderate compensation for my time and travelling expenses. It is probable that many grammatical errors will be discovered by my learned reader; but he will, I am sure, wave criticism, when he is informed, that the only colleges that I have had an opportunity of studying in were, mines, smelting works, and manufactories.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSALS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE first mines I would recommend, are situ∣ated in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, five miles from Strasburgh, thirteen from Lancaster, thir∣ty-five from Wilmington, fifty from Philadel∣phia, and only two miles from the turnpike road.</P>
<P>They were discovered by a German, of the name of Tersey, in or before the year 1732; and in that year, the hon. John Penn, made a grant of the land where the mine was found, to the following gentlemen, for the express purpose of having it worked, viz. governor Hamilton, judge Allen, James Logan, James Steel, and Thomas Schute, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> And it also appears, that Mr. Penn joined in the expense of opening the mine, &amp;c. in doing which, they discovered one of those uncommon vitriolic springs, called by the Germans, <HI>ziment wasser,</HI> i. e. water strongly impregnated with the vitriol of copper, or, as some writers have called them, copper springs; but, notwithstanding this invaluable discovery, it does not appear that any of the gentlemen were acquainted with the value of the water, as no attempt appears to have ever been made to turn it to account after the European manner, which I shall have occasion to describe. But previous, I will, for the satisfaction of those who may wish to forward my plan, state the proofs I have ob∣tained
<PB N="8" REF="032245_0006_0FF1A3F00415F1B8"/>of such a spring having been actually dis∣covered, in the Gap mines, when first opened. These proofs also, fortunately, report the quan∣tity and value of the water; and, from the great ability as well as respectability of the men, leave no doubt of the truth of the discovery. The report is as follows:</P>

<P>IN the province of Pennsylva∣nia is a copper mine, which af∣fords a spring, that appears to have the same ef∣fect as that Irish water lately described by Dr. William Henry, and Dr. Bond, in the 47th, and 48th volumes of the philosophical transactions, but is much sharper, for it will dissolve iron in a quarter part of the time; and we are assured, by the accounts transmitted from the proprietors of it, of the trials they have made, that it yields the same copper, mud, or dust, as our crone∣baun water, of the county of Wicklow, in this kingdom, (being the water above mentioned) which, being collected from bars of iron im∣mersed in it, for the purpose of extracting the copper from the Pennsylvania water, it produced above half pure copper, on being melted in a crucible; an experiment that requires to be re∣peated, in order to ascertain the proportion of copper contained, with accuracy; our copper spring, of the county of Wicklow, yielding a
<PB N="9" REF="032245_0007_0FF1A420B2071D18"/>proportion considerably larger than this, viz. six∣teen parts of copper out of twenty of the mud.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood is a great abundance of the ores of vitriol and sulphur, and the spring comes through an immense body of vitriol ore, and the supply of water is very large; 700 or 800 hogsheads flowing in 24 hours. The wa∣ter is of a pale green colour, of an acid, sweet, austere, inky, and nauseous taste.</P>
<P>But the genuine quality, as well as large pro∣portion of the impregnating salt, will further appear by the following analysis of this water, viz. a pint of it exhaled by a slow fire, left 400 grains of solid contents, which were partly green, and partly ochre coloured, with an intermixture of bluish, and of a rough sweetish taste, like that of sal martis, and appeared to be chiefly saline, not leaving above four grains of indisso∣luble matter, on dissolving 196 grains of it and filtring.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the proportion of vitrio∣lic parts in this water is very large, viz. above six drachms to a pint, or 3200 grains to a gal∣lon; and, consequently, it is a stronger solution of vitriol than sea water is of marine salt; and moreover is, truly, considerably the strongest of all the vitriolic waters that have yet occurred to my observation; for, our Cronebaun water, in the county of Wicklow, gives but 256 grains from a gallon; Haigh, in Lancashire, (the strongest in Britain, that I know of) 1920 grains; Shad∣well, 1320; Kilbrew, in the county of Mealth, 1530, from the same quantity; so that, besides the copper to be obtained by immersing bars of
<PB N="10" REF="032245_0008_0FF1A3F2FA623290"/>iron, as in our county of Wicklow water, this water offers to its proprietors another peculiar advantage, viz. an opportunity of erecting a copperas work, or manufacture, of vitriol; es∣pecially, the vast supply of water, and plenty of fuel in the place, considered.</P>

<HEAD>Certificate of Dr. Logan, respecting the copper springs at the Gap mine, Lancaster county.</HEAD>
<P>I DO CERTIFY, that Dr. Benj. Franklin, a few weeks before his death, informed me, that, at the time the Gap copper-mine, in Lancaster county, belonging to James Logan, and others, was worked, a spring of water was discovered in the same, highly impregnated with copper. A bottle of the water was sent to him, with which he frequently made experiments with his knife, which, being for a short time immersed in the water, would assume the appearance of copper.</P>

<P>THIS IS TO CERTIFY, to whom it may concern, that we the subscribers were frequently at the copper mines in Lancaster county, known by the name of the Gap mine, during the time the said mine was working by James Logan and Co.; and, from hearing the people often talking of the water turning iron into copper, we have very often, when at the mines, put the blade of our knives into the water as it came from the pumps, which, in a few minutes, would be covered with copper. A negro, called black Ned, took advantage of this circumstance and fixed a large trough in such manner that part of the water from the pumps used to run through the same. In this trough he put pieces of old iron, which the water (as then understood) turn∣ed into copper, of which he used to make buc∣kles, handles for knives, and other small articles. This negro was a smith by trade, and was said to be a very ingenious man.</P>
<P>And we further certify, that we have often seen quantities of the ore got in this mine, and frequently heard the miners say, that it was a very rich mine, if the water could be kept down so as they could work constantly. At this time, there were eight pumps working in the pit, which turned out so much water that it over∣flowed a meadow, and destroyed the grass so ef∣fectually that most of the places the water used to cover, are barren at this time. The same wa∣ter was also supposed to kill the fish, as they were at that time destroyed for several miles down the creek.</P>

<SALUTE>MR. HENFREY. <HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE to lament that the Gap mine cannot be worked upon terms worthy of its consequence, in my opinion, unless advances larger than my present engagements permit, can be brought for∣ward. I visited the work, you know, when one of the shafts was nearly exhausted; and, from the effect of the little water of the ziment kind then examined, it produced a precipitation which was promising indeed. From the effect of this kind of water first in Germany, then in Arklow, and lastly from the artificial ziment water in the Paris mine, I am convinced, nothing could be more profitable. Could the work proceed upon proper principles, with a capital equal to erec∣ting an engine to free the works of water, and saving of the martial vitriol, and sulphur, I be∣lieve no estate could equal it. How different, from pursuing a vein through a <HI>stony country,</HI> of incertain yield, is the process of precipitation, which proceeds with little labour, whilst we are at rest. That the ore after roasting and catch∣ing the sulphureous quality to a profit, would be
<PB N="13" REF="032245_0011_0FF1A426B75F5AA0"/>an object to the company, I have no doubt; but I cannot, without aid, pursue the necessary plan, and must therefore accede to a sale of shares, if partners well disposed to a fair experiment of public utility and fair and reasonable profits can be procured. I therefore, Sir, agree to the sale of shares, so as to bring to the test the value of that work, but without relinquishing all my right, and you will consider this as the evidence of my assent. What number of shares I shall retain, will depend upon other circumstances, but I believe, from my known opinion of the prospect, you will suppose the number will be as great as I can compass.</P>

<P><HI>As many of my readers will, I presume, be unac∣quainted with the value of copper springs, that have been discovered in Europe, I have conclud∣ed that the following extracts may give them much satisfaction, being from such unquestionable and respectable authority.</HI></P>
<P>'IN the year 1673, Doctor Brown visited a famous copper mine at Hern Grundt, about se∣ven English miles from <HI>New Sol,</HI> in upper Hun∣gary, and he informs us, that there he saw two springs, called the old and new ziment, which turned iron into copper, as it is vulgarly said.</P>
<P>'But the case is, that the iron is dissolved by the vitriolic acid of this spring-water, and the copper is precipitated in its metallic form in the place of the iron.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="032245_0012_0FF1A3F7B86E80B0"/>
'It has been the custom in Germany for some centuries, to collect the copper contained in these waters, by filling with them some pits made purposely for this operation. Old iron is thrown in; and, being dissolved by the acid, is suspen∣ded in the water while the copper is precipita∣ted; the mud being raked out, is melted after∣wards in a furnace, and very fine copper is pro∣duced. From 100 tons of iron, 84 and some∣times 90 tons of fine copper is thus produced.</P>
<P>'But although this method of obtaining cop∣per has been long practised in Germany, yet it is but of late years, says bishop Watson, (<HI>p.</HI> 238 of the first volume of his essays) that any suc∣cessful attempts of this kind have been made either in England or Ireland; in the last, at least, it was quite owing to an accident. There are the very celebrated copper mines at Arklow, in the county of Wicklow, in Ireland, and from these mines issue a great quantity of water strong∣ly impregnated with vitriol of copper. One of the workmen having accidentally left an iron shovel in the <HI>water</HI> he found it, some weeks af∣ter, so incrusted with a coat of copper, that it was thought to be changed into copper.</P>
<P>'The proprietors of the mines, in pursuance of this hint, made proper pits and receptacles for the water; and have obtained, by means of soft iron bars put in them, such quantities of cop∣per, that these streams are now of as much con∣sequence as the mines themselves.</P>
<P>'One ton of iron produces near two tons of copper mud, and each ton of mud produces, when melted, 1600 wt. fine copper, which sells
<PB N="15" REF="032245_0013_0FF1A428579965A8"/>for £ 10 sterling per ton more than the copper which is fluxed from the ore.</P>
<P>'There is, in the Isle of Anglesey, on the coast of North-Wales, a mountain called Paris, which abounds in copper ore, the bed of ore being above 40 feet in thickness. The lesees of this mine, annually raise from six to 700 tons of merchant∣able ore, and daily employ above 40 furnaces in smelting it. This ore contains a great quantity of sulphur, which must be separated by roasting before it can be fluxed into copper.</P>
<P>'The phlogiston, with part of the vitriolic acid, is dipersed into the air by the force of the fire. Another part of the acid attacks and dissolves such a quantity of the copper, that the water in which the roasted ore is washed (by means of old iron immersed in it according to the German method) produces great quantities of fine cop∣per, so that the proprietors have there obtained, in one year, near 100 tons of copper precipitated from this water.</P>
<P>'If this water was afterwards evaporated, it would yield green vitriol, at the rate of nearly 200 tons of vitriol, for each hundred tons of iron.'</P>
<P>I have visited both the above mines, and know that the bishop's statements are taken from facts, and upon which I founded my calculations, <HI>See the Table.</HI> When I was at the Arklow mines in Ireland, one of the proprietors informed me, that they had then four hundred tons of iron in the different pits and reservoirs, precipitating the copper fom the water, and that they should en∣crease the quantity. He also said, that they were
<PB N="16" REF="032245_0014_0FF1A3FD9DF88410"/>buying plates of cast iron, which, if found to answer, would make a very great saving; and, since I came to America, I have received infor∣mation, that the cast iron did answer, and that they use no other, either at <HI>Crone Baun,</HI> or in the isle of Anglesey.</P>
<P>Since the discovery of these natural vitriolic waters, the proprietors of copper mines have ta∣ken the hint of trying the ores after roasting, and find that, where they are highly sulphureous, the waters used to wash them (which is done before smelting) always become sufficiently im∣pregnated with copper, to pay them well for their trouble and expence of precipitating it by means of iron.</P>
<P>In my estimate, I have put only a small value upon the ORE at the Gap mines, notwithstand∣ing the quantity is immense, and similar to the <HI>ore</HI> worked in the isle of Anglesey. I have sunk upon the body in several places, and always found the ore within a few feet of the surface, but it cannot be got in quantity until there is a ma∣chine erected to pump off the water. The <HI>ore</HI> may then be raised with as much ease as the quarrying of stone.</P>
<P>I have treated this ore in the same manner they do the ore at the Anglesey mines, and have al∣ways obtained a proportionate yield of copper from it; and I now say, that it is my candid opinion, that this body or bed of ore, may be worked to great and certain profit. But I find that it is a generally received opinion in this country, that wages are yet too high to carry on any large works to advantage. That this re∣mark
<PB N="17" REF="032245_0015_0FF1A42B6BE5EA40"/>may be well founded, with regard to ma∣nufactures, I admit, but that it applies with equal force to mining I deny.</P>
<P>There is no manufactory in England but what is carried on by constant opposition of one ma∣nufacturer against another, and their first care is to reduce the poor workmen as low as they pos∣sibly can. But the mining business is carried on in a very different manner; the work is almost all done by <HI>bargains.</HI> When a vien of ore is discovered, a miner or gang of miners are offer∣ed the work, and the captain (i. e. the manager) and they settle the price per ton that shall be paid by the proprietors for raising the ore. These con∣tracts are generally made for from one to three months, and they are, in fact, a continued lottery between the miners and proprietors of the mines. If the vein prove poor, then the miners make only low wages; if rich, they will make from one to five pounds sterling per day, and that for weeks together. This is a proof, that a mine can pay great wages, and yet give great fortunes to the owners; for the managers never let a bar∣gain to the miners but with a certainty of gain to the proprietors.</P>
<P>The great risk in mining is in searching for the vein of ore and opening the works. A stri∣king proof of this was exhibited at <HI>Schuyler</HI>'s mines, near Newark, in New-Jersey. Some years after those mines were known to be very productive, a company in Bristol (in England) to whom some of the ore had been sent, obtain∣ed a lease from the owners of the land on the opposite side of the hill, where Schuyler was
<PB N="18" REF="032245_0016_0FF1A3FF2962A290"/>raising ore in great quantities. They sent over a number of experienced miners and other work∣men who continued to search for the vein, until they had spent their employers £ 30,000, who then gave up the pursuit. All this time, Mr. Schuyler was making a large fortune, which shews that high wages are not so inimical to the working of mines in any country, if you have a good vein of ore to work upon. But I will admit that, where wages are low, you may work a poor mine to advantage, which, in a country where they are high, you might lose money by.</P>
<P>The fact just stated shews wherein the danger of working mines consists, and I am ready to admit it is very great. But, at the Gap mines, there is no risk. The ore, we know, is there in great abundance, and the vitriolic spring, which is of an incalculable value, I have proved, by re∣peated trials, to be in those mines, and the works are now in such a state as to require only the aid of a machine of sufficient power to raise the water so as to keep the pits clean. A steam en∣gine, of moderate powers, will be capable of do∣ing this.</P>
<P>But there are many objections to erecting a steam engine in this country. 1 st. The great ex∣pence of erecting one; 2d, the consumption of fuel; 3d, the frequent repairs; and 4th, the high wages you must give to an engineer to at∣tend the machine. I would, therefore, recom∣mend that a level should be brought up through a meadow to the mines, by which a fall of from 25 to 30 feet may be gained, and a water-wheel of 25 feet diameter will be sufficient to works as
<PB N="19" REF="032245_0017_0FF1A42FC2E74558"/>many pumps as will clear the mines of the com∣mon, and raise the copper water for use. There are three small streams in the mine lands, that may be conducted into on reservoir, which would then, I am certain, give as much water as the machine will require to keep it constantly going.</P>
<P>The machinery, on this plan, will be simple, and such as may be made at the mines. Nor will it be so liable to get out of order as the works of a steam engine. Another advantage will be, the saving of fuel, which may be esti∣mated at between two and three cords per day; and further, if this plan is put in practice, the mines may be much sooner made productive; for when the level is brought up, the bed of poor ore, before noted, will be laid dry, and may be worked to immediate profit much sooner than if we have to wait for the erecting of a steam engine, and at much less expense to the compa∣ny. It may be proper to note another circum∣stance in favour of the level, which is, that I have well-founded reason to suppose, that, as much ore may be raised in driving it as will pay a con∣siderable part, if not all the expence; and, when the works are completed, the repairs would be but trifling compared with those of a steam en∣gine, which would be a constant and heavy draw∣back upon the company's profits. My candid opinion, therefore, is, after the most mature con∣sideration, in favour of the level, and a machine to be worked by water.</P>
<P>I will now, for the information of those per∣sons who may be disposed to join in forwarding the proposed plan, note the</P>

<HEAD>PRESENT STATE OF THE WORKS AT THE GAP MINES.</HEAD>
<P>We have built a saw-mill, made two dams, and cut a head, tail, race, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is a large log-house for the copperas works, a large lead boiler, several ley tubs, cisterns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are a carpenter's and smith's shops, and two log-houses for workmen.</P>
<P>There is a variety of tools, with pit-ropes, wind∣lasses, buckets, &amp;c.; also, a complete set of boring rods, one hundred feet long.</P>
<P>The two main shafts have been cleaned out, which was attended with great trouble and difficulty, as we were obliged to work night and day on account of the water.</P>
<P>There is a machine to work the pumps which will be of great use in getting the water out until a more powerful one can be completed; and there are eight tier of pumps, two tier deep, all in good wor∣king order. About fifty tons of are have been rais∣ed, and a great deal of other work done, but which I do not conceive it necessary for me to describe.</P>
<P>I shall, therefore, only further note, that a small part of the level is drove, and that two men are now at work upon it.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>These various works have cost our company a considerable sum, as will appear by our books, and the company who first opened the mines must, I am certain, have expended at least thir∣ty thousand dollars; so that the proposed com∣pany will come in on very advantageous terms, as, by those expences, the mines have been put
<PB N="21" REF="032245_0019_0FF1A4314E23B488"/>in such a state that they only now require a steam or other engine to make them pay the pro∣fit I have stated, and with probability much greater.</P>
<P>I will now describe the works below:</P>
<P>One of the pits is seven feet square, the other is seven by five. The wide shaft is only about sixty feet deep; the other is much deeper, the vitriolic water rises fifteen feet from the bottom of the wide shaft, and there is forty feet of com∣mon water over it; this I have proved many times by my boring rods.</P>
<P>When we had cleared the pits of earth and stones, and had the waters out, I went down. I found the main shaft in most excellent order; the frame, consisting of squared logs, laid close upon each other, as in building a house; in short, I never saw such strong work, and so well secu∣red, in any mine I ever was in before.</P>
<P>I found that three drifts had been drove from the main shaft. One of them I suppose to be more than two hundred yards, as it communi∣cates with some shafts that were sunk upon a small hill. Another extends only about twenty yards, at the end of which a sump had been sunken, and I found a pump that had been worked by hand in this sump. An old man, who worked at these mines when first open∣ed, told me, that he had often heard the miners say, that there was a very rich vien of ore in the place where the hand pump was fixed, but he said, that all the contrivances they could think of were not sufficient to keep the water down.</P>

Several of the old Dutchmen who remember the first opening of and are still living near the Gap mines, have told me, that they knew for certain, that the miners frequently met with lumps of gold; and one family has been poin∣ted out to me, who are now wealthy, and who, my informer said, he knew had bought <HI>ore</HI> from the miners several times; and that this man went back to Germany, and that it was well known, that he took some small barrels of the <HI>ore</HI> from the Gap mines with him.</P>
<P>My informer also said, that the man returned, and that he soon after bought a plantation. He also said, that he knew all his friends in Germa∣ny, that they were all poor, and that he was certain he could not have gotten his money any other way; that a brother of his father's (then in Germany) wrote to him to send him some <HI>ore</HI> from the same mine that the person alluded to got his from, and that it was very rich in gold.</P>
<P>I do not bring forward this common report with a view to recommend the mines; nor do I place any dependance on the various stories that have been told me, of gold having been got in them—yet it is a common and well-known fact, that some copper <HI>ores</HI> are often rich in both gold and silver. The reason with me for men∣tioning it is, as proof that an ore of some value has been found in those mines; and, should it only prove to be rich in copper, I shall not wish for any thing more valuable. That there was a great deal of ore raised, I have not the smallest doubt; nor that there is an immense quantity in the mines. But, be this as it may, my depen∣dance
<PB N="23" REF="032245_0021_0FF1A432E0B805B8"/>is, and always was, upon the strength of the vitriolic water. When a spring of this kind is once fortunately discovered, they have never been known to fail, and the profits arising from them are just as certain as that two and two make four.</P>
<P>It is now one hundred and twenty-four years since Dr. Brown's report was made on the <HI>cop∣per</HI> spring in Hungary, and forty-one since Dr. Rutty's account of those in Ireland, and both those springs still continue to run, and give great profits to their owners. The spring at Crone Baun, in Ireland, was purchased about eight years ago by the Liverpool company, and it was said they gave £. 20,000 sterling for them, and that, at the end of the second year, they had cleared upwards of £. 40,000 sterling by them.</P>
<P>I now submit to every candid and intelligent person, if there is not, in many of the common pursuits of man to gain property, as much risk as there will be in working a mine under such circumstances as I have described. That min∣ing, in general, may be compared to a lottery I am ready to admit; but, that it may be reduced to as great a certainty as most other trades and occupations, I must also insist upon; and, when a fortunate discovery is made, the adventurers acquire wealth much sooner than by any other business that I am acquainted with. I will also admit, that many men have been ruined by mining; but this has been owing to their own folly, by risking too much, which they have been allured to by the prospect of great gains. But let me ask, is not this also the case in the mer∣chantile
<PB N="24" REF="032245_0022_0FF1A4087ABDCFB0"/>world? Great strokes, as they are called, are sometimes made by great risks, but the pru∣dent, well-informed merchant, will never ap∣prove them. It is the same in mining. A stri∣king instance, among many that I could recite, was the case of lord Hopeton, of Scotland. He had spent the greatest part of his fortune in searching for a vein of lead ore on his estate, which some miners had reported to him they were certain they could find. But the chase con∣tinued so long, that his lordship's purse began to complain, and he determined to give up the pur∣suit; but the miners, being confident of success, agreed to give their employer a month's work; the consequence was, that, in the middle of the last week of the month, they came upon the vein, which was a very rich one. Lord Hope∣ton died only a few years ago, and was said to be one of the richest men in Scotland, which he made intirely by those lead mines, and they still continue to be productive.</P>
<P>It may, probably, be an objection with some to my plan, that the Gap mines have never been productive; but this, without presuming too much, may I believe, be accounted for. The original company consisted entirely of men of great property, but not one of them appears to have had any knowledge of the mining busi∣ness; of course, every thing was left to mana∣gers, who had no interest further than their sa∣lary. Under such circumstances, great underta∣kings have generally failed.</P>
<P>But the failure of those gentlemen, becomes an advantage to those who follow. They ex∣pended
<PB N="25" REF="032245_0023_0FF1A437870F0D78"/>a large sum, and proved the mines to be valuable; but, under such management, had the produce been ever so great, they would, proba∣bly, have got but little of it, and that a mine may be given up, and yet be very rich in <HI>ore,</HI> the famous Paris mine, in the isle of Anglesey, is a proof. Several unsuccessful attempts had been made upon this mine, before the Liverpool com∣pany undertook it; their property is large, and most of them are well skilled, both in the art of mining and smelting. A number of men were set to work, and they soon discovered a large body of poor copper <HI>ore;</HI> and, it appears, that they have raised from 6 to 7000 tons of ore every year, since the discovery, and have obtained near 100 tons of fine copper, every year, from the wa∣ter, as I have before noted. In order to shew that the above mine had been worked before the Li∣verpool company got a lease from the proprietor, (lord Uxbridge) I will mention a curious cir∣cumstance that happened respecting this mine. A Mr. Griffith, a poor Welsh curate, in look∣ing over some old papers which had come into his hands by the death of his wife's grand-father, found an old lease, that had been granted by the present lord Uxbridge's father to said Griffith's wife's grand-father, the term of which was not expired. This happened when the mines were giving up treasure in the most extraordinary manner. Mr. Griffith, on this discovery, takes the lease to a Mr. Williams, an attorney, who informs him, that he thinks his right good, as his wife was the heir of her grand-father. Mr. Griffith makes this business known to the com∣pany
<PB N="26" REF="032245_0024_0FF1A40CD96A7070"/>then working the mines; but they were not disposed to admit his claim. He applies to to his friend, the attorney, again, and entered in∣to an agreement with him that he should have half of all he gets if he succeeds, but the curate to be subject to no cost. The business remains in law for a considerable time; but the company are compelled, at last, to admit the poor curate's claim; by which, both he and the attorney have become men of large fortunes, and of some note. Williams was elected a member of parliament seven or eight years ago; and the curate, I have been told, thinks himself as good a man as any bifhop in England.</P>
<P>Let us now consider the necessity there is for the people of America to turn their thoughts to the subject of mining. Copper sells now for three shillings per pound, and the avarage for six years past may be rated at two shillings and nine pence. This high price will be attributed to the wars in Europe, and I admit that they may have operated so as to occasion an advance. But, was there no other reason, the rise would only have been in proportion to the rise of insu∣rence. In that case, the advance would only have been about four per cent.; instead of which we find that the rise avarages about twenty per cent.; a striking proof that there must be other causes, and, so far as relates to the mining interest in England, (in particular) they are of a more seri∣ous nature than the present war; for the fact is, that the copper mines in that country have been declining in produce for the last ten years, and, since the <HI>use</HI> of sheathing and copper bolts for
<PB N="27" REF="032245_0025_0FF1A43BF0BB76C0"/>ships have come into practice, the demand for copper has been gradually increasing. The Ec∣ton mine, in Staffordshire, belonging to the duke of Devonshire, which, for upwards of twenty years, yielded a profit of from twenty to even £. 30,000 sterling per annum, is entirely work∣ed out. The mines in Cornwall have become much less productive; and the famous Paris mine, in the isle of Anglesey, which has given such immense fortunes to its owners, is apparently working out very fast. Mr. Williams, who is now the principal man in these mines, has made se∣veral tours through different parts of Scotland within the last six years, entirely for the purpose of discovering mines; and, it was well known, that the failure of the Paris mine was the reason.</P>
<P>But, whether it is owing to a failure of the mines, or the encreased demand for copper, the effect here will be the same; and, the rapid en∣crease of population in the United States, must add greatly to the demand. Let us, for a mo∣ment, look back to the situation of this country, during the revolution, both with regard to lead and copper. The latter was frequently sold for ten shillings per pound, hard money, and the quan∣tity to be got, even at that price, was far short of this demand. But I should be sorry to be un∣derstood as looking forward to deriving any ad∣vantage to my plan from the calamities of war. No, my hopes and prayers are, that this happy country may never experience it again; but, as the wisdom of men have not yet discovered any mode of settling national differences, without first having recourse to arms, it certainly is sound po∣licy
<PB N="28" REF="032245_0026_0FF1A40E661A9BB0"/>in every nation to render itself as indepen∣dent as possible of any other. Now, as this is admitted to be <HI>sound policy</HI> among the European nations, how much stronger does it apply to re∣mote countries, and, in particular, to the United States; where population has encreased and is encreasing in so rapid a degree!</P>
<P>The origin of commerce must have been from some nation having a surplus of sundry articles, and offering those articles in exchange to ano∣ther nation for something they had to spare; and, probably, for something the other country did not produce. This must have been the case, for the trade by barter must, of necessity, have taken place as soon as there was a hundred hu∣man beings in the world, but it was a long time before metal was thought of being used as a me∣dium for commerce. Trade is still regulated by the same policy, from which it originated. Ports are opened and shut as the necessity occurs. This, in general, only relates to grain; but it is only a few years ago that there was an embargo laid upon copper in Britain, and this may be fre∣quently the case, as copper is now classed among the articles of naval stores, and as the con∣sumption is so much encreased, in that coun∣try. The rise of copper in England has alarmed the manufacturers, and several companies have been formed among that useful class of people, for the purpose of working mines and smelting the ores. In Birmingham, the company, when first formed, consisted of one hundred shares of £. 500 sterling each; and no man was allowed to have more than one share. The reason is obvious:
<PB N="29" REF="032245_0027_0FF1A43EF14CF4D8"/>it was a new business with them; they therefore adopted that prudent plan in order to prevent any man from being ruined by risking too much, which some men are apt to do, and particularly in <HI>mining.</HI> This undertaking shews the good sense of those who carried it into effect. The price of copper, about twenty years ago, was as low as seven-pence per pound sterling, and con∣tinued so for several years. It has since varied much in price, but I do not remember that it was ever down so low as the price noted, and it is now at sixteen-pence per pound. I have recei∣ved information that this company have been very successful, and that a company, on a similar plan, has been since formed in the town of Sheffield. Need I remark, that, if it was thought necessary by the manufacturers in Britain to pay attention to mining, that there certainly must be a much greater necessity for the manufacturers in Ame∣rica to do it? I will even extend the idea further, I will say, that it is the interest of every indivi∣dual (the importer excepted) in the United States, to join in any well formed plan for work∣ing the mines of this country; and that the United States abounds with copper, lead, and iron, is notorious to every one; and I have found, by assay, many of the ores both of lead and cop∣per are rich in silver, and some of the copper ores hold gold. I have discovered lead ores in several parts of this state that are much richer than any I ever assayed in England. Sixty ounces of fine silver from a ton of lead is considered very rich there, but the ore I allude to, gives two hundred and forty ounces, which I have
<PB N="30" REF="032245_0028_0FF1A4118B77D638"/>proved by repeated trials. Lead, in England, is refined when only containing twenty ounces; but, in that case, the litharge must be sold; as there is, by this process, an encrease of weight equal to ten per cent. But, if the litharge is to be reduced to lead again, a loss of near fifteen per cent. takes place; of course it requires the lead to be richer in silver when the refiner has not a demand for all his litharge.</P>
<P>Zinc ores are found in great quantities in se∣veral states. Some cobalt has also been discovered, of good quality; but I never have been so for∣tunate as to meet with any tin ore. However, I have no doubt but it will be discovered when mines are more generally sought for. Na∣ture has not been sparing of her bounties, in this respect, to the United States. The Supreme Being has wisely ordered it so, that, although he has created every thing for the use of man, yet he cannot enjoy it without industry, and, in many cases, not without great exertions, both of mind and body, and in none more so than what relates to the working of mines. From these observations may we not conclude, that there is not in society a more useful member than the miner; since all that his industry produces is adding to the public stock? It must also be re∣membered, that the plough cannot go until the miner has first produced the metal.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg leave to recommend my estimate and plan to the serious considera∣tion of my readers, and to assure them, that the views contemplated by this scheme are fair and honourable.</P>

<P>Note, that, in the above estimate, I have made no charge for erecting the furnaces, mills, and battery works, that will be required to smelt and refine the copper, and work it up into bars, bolts, sheets, and bottoms for stills; and, on that account, I have rated it at only 1 <ABBR><HI>s</HI></ABBR>3 per pound, so that the copper-mud, and ore may, the first year, if the company choose, be sent to England, as the copper would, at the price it now sells for there, be worth from 1 <ABBR><HI>s</HI></ABBR>6 to 1 <ABBR><HI>s</HI></ABBR>8 per pound, this currency. But, as this would be attended with considerable loss, I shall re∣commend that the copper-mud and ore be prepared ready for smelting, and carefully stored, and, when the directors find, by the monthly returns, that there is a considerable quantity prepared, I should advise that a committee be appointed to go to the mines and take samples from the ore and copper-mud, which should be divided into two equal parts and sealed up; one part to be delivered to the ma∣nager of the mines, and the directors to take the other, which should be sent to the mint to be assay∣ed. By this mode, the directors will know the true value of the ore and mud, and whether the mana∣ger's report is just. They will also know by the quantity when to order the smelting and battery works to be erected, which I would advise should be done in the completest manner.</P>
