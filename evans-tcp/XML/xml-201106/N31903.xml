<HEAD>A Vision of Hell, &amp; a Discovery of some of the Consultations &amp; Devices there.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month of May in the Year 1767, in a morning after I had been some time out of bed, I was musing upon the low state of religion, and the great progress of vice; I considered how the Devils would rejoice and triumph in the decay of piety, and in the flood of immorality that threaten∣ed to deluge the world.—While I was thus musing, I sell into a sort of trance, I was certainly not a sleep; my fancy and imagination were most lively, and yet I retained m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> memory and reason perfectly, I seemed to have a visionary view, or clear represen∣tation of hell, or the world of miserable spirits My mind was strangely enlarged to view and compre∣hend things—Hell, seemed a fire, as large as all this world, surrounded with impenetrable walls: the gate was very wide and was continually open, but guarded by the strongest and cruelest devils: and the brightest flame of the hotest fire seemed to stream out of the gate an amazing length: in the midst of this immense fire were innumerable devils, and misera∣ble souls of Adam's race.</P>
<P>I perceived the devils came to this world and re∣turned to hell often. They came here to tempt, se∣duce, and destroy mankind. and returned to hell to consult and contrive the most effectual methods to ruin souls. Their greatest malignity was against God, and Jesus Christ. Their malicious desire, and cursed endeavour, was to dishonour God, and prevent Christ having glory among mankind. I perceived their principal design in promoting sin, and bringing sinners to hell, was to disappoint God, reflect dishonour on the methods of his grace, and prevent Christ's being glorified by the salvation of sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. The devils were much elated with pride, and filled with boasting, that their empire in this world, was larger than Immanuel's and that they had more servants and subjects than he; and that Christ's laws and authority, were so little regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="042104_0003_101B8B9D64868A48"/>
The devils held consultation upon many subjects. I perceived they had been in deep consultation upon several methods to dishonour God. But they were just entering upon a new subject, as I had this vision of Hell. Two principal devils had then just re∣turned from this world, to the infernal pit. The one was Moloch, the other Lucifer. The devils as∣sembled to hear what success, and to consult upon further measures—The damned souls were in mul∣titudes all around, and as oft as they pleased, might attend, and hear the debates of the devils, for there was no privacy there.</P>
<P>The consultation which they held, while I had this vision, was concerning the Gospel ministry, and the sabbath, or Lord's day. They employed their infernal wisdom in devising how they might most effectually defeat God's end and design in both these.</P>
<P>I shall give a faithful narrative of their consulta∣tion and determinations. But to make my account the more intelligible, it may be proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to give the names and characters of some of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cipal devils. I shall mention only some of the chief. Their names were Belzebub, Lucifer, Moloch, Apollion, Mammon, Dagon, Belial, Baal, and Nisroch.</P>
<P>As to their character, 'tis to be observed, that they have all a skill and disposition to any, and all evil: but yet most of them are peculiarly disposed to promote some particular sin and vice, more than others. Indeed, Belzebub the chief, is so skilled in all iniquity, and so bent and disposed to all that is bad, that there is no devil in hell exceeds him, in any one evil. Lucifer's peculiar character is to act as an angel of light, and induce to evil under a shew or false appearance of good. Moloch, is the devil that vehemently tempts, and urges people to all vice in an open, bold, daring manner, leading them to commit sin, with impudence, or without shame. Apollion, is the devil of cruelty, who tempts to malice and revenge, and peculiarly delights in the misery of mankind. Mammon, is continually tempt∣ing men to covetousness, and to make this world
<PB N="4" REF="042104_0004_101B8BA011EFDF88"/>their treasure and delight. Dagon, is the devil of sloth, who tempts men to sloth and negligence in religion, and to sink into a dead sullen despair of any good. Belial, is the devil that tempts to dis∣obedience and obstinacy; and has peculiar influence with youth, who dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bey their parents. Baal, is an unclean devil, and excites to the indulgence of all sorts of fleshly lusts, and vicious appetites. Nis∣roch, is the devil of pride, and is continually tempt∣ing and exciting to that sin.</P>
<P>Moloch, and Lucifer, being just returned from this earth, as I observed, and the devils being as∣sembled, there consultation &amp; devices were as follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hail, ye principalities and powers: let joy run thro, the vault of hell, such joy as this horrible pit can allow; for we have great success. Vice abounds; Jehovah is dishonoured; his laws are dis∣regarded; Messiah is dispised; we have more subjects on earth, ye whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the gospel is pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched, than he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>We feel the helish joy in all our hearts. But while we boast in the success there has been, we must employ our infernal wisdom in contriving something farther against Jehovah, and his govern∣ment; for I shall never be easy, till he is dispised or neglected by every rational creature. We must try by every diabolical art, to counteract the great design of Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall all heartily join in what is now proposed, that we may bring millions to blaspheme him in hell to all eternity, ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of praising him in heaven as he proposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>The preaching of the gospel, is the detestable means of diminishing our kingdom. We have long found by sad experience, that <HI>Faith comes by bear∣ing,</HI> what they call, the glad tidings of salvation. I wish we could some way defeat the hell-hated design of a preached gospel, which is so adapted to attract the hearts of sinners, and turn them from our interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>The institution of the sabbath, &amp; the exerci∣ses of it, are also hateful means of encroaching upon us, and diminishing our subjects; I wish it was for
<PB N="5" REF="042104_0005_101B8BA2CC275018"/>ever abolished, &amp; no sabba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or sabbath-exercises left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis worthy our angelic wisdom, to enter into a deep consultation at this time, upon these two points, viz. how we may frustrate the design of the preached gospel, and render u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less the sabbath-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have all had opportunity to observe in ages past, that the observance of the sabbath, and religion, stand and fall together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we could by sloth, or any other way keep people from attending public worship, our great end would in a good measure be answered, as to a preach∣ed gospel, and the sabbath both. I propose there∣fore that we attempt this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>My worthy associate who spoke last, has proposed, something very proper in its place; but I think we ought not to depend upon that alone. Let us lay our scheme deeper and larger; and try in many ways, which I am sure our superior wisdom can devise, to defeat the design of preaching the gospel and the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent proposal! And let us take parti∣cular care to cover our designs as much as possible, &amp; give them such a colouring that mankind may think them rational. We never succeed so well as when we act like angels of light. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a rational crea∣ture, and though fallen, has yet that detestable thing they call <HI>Conscience;</HI> which puts the soul into a strange commotion, when sin appears in its proper colour. I dread conscience more than any thing in human na∣ture, since the sall of man; therefore, in all we do, let us keep our design as much as possible out of sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Lucifer son of the morning, we all perceive the wisdom of thy advice. and let us attempt what Belzebub has proposed, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every way possible, de∣feat the fatal tendency of a preached gospel. For we all observe, that from the cities, towns, and congre∣gations. where the gospel is clearly and faithfully dispensed, there are fewer souls come to hell, than from other places. The seats of glory, and felicity in heaven, from which we fell, are filled up from time to time, with human souls, that go from places where that detestable gospel is clearly exhibited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="042104_0006_101B8BA69914CE90"/>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We all knew the difference between the places P—l, and R—S. In one of these the gospel is clearly preached, by that detestable wretch K—L—In the other, how little hurt is done to us, where Z—R. pretends to preach; but his life and doctrine are such, that we lose but little by him. Let us therefore, if possible, prevent a clear, faithful, searching method of preaching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think my friend, we are all agreed in the main design. Let us now enter upon the properest means and most artful method to accomplish our purpose. And as AI fear we shall never entirely set aside the gospel ministry, I think one leading stop to accom∣plish our purpose, is, to induce bad men to enter into the ministry. If people will have preaching, let us put forward those that will answer our own pur∣pose, or at m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st do us but little hurt, &amp; by that means we shall keep out those whom we have and sear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gospel in the hand of a slothful man does us but little hurt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor in the hand of a sensualist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor, yet in the hand of a worlding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apol.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart feels peculiar satisfaction when those who have the Character of gospel ministers, are guilty of adultery, drunkenness, or other scandalous sins: it gives a sort of support and encouragement to vicious persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inks the hearts of the good, and confirms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>idels; scarce any thing reflects more dishonour upon the Son of God, &amp; disgrace to his plan of Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>To promote our design, I think we ought to lead all Clergymen, whether good or bad, to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y their calling) great things in this world, riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, honour, ease, and a state above the common level of mankind. Some who have not entered the mi∣nistry with a principal rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to worldly things, yet have tho't that those things ought to be the fruit of their labour, and that they should receive them in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. &amp; when they are disappointed, it affords a good occasion to excite a quarrel between them &amp; their people, and produce such prejudices, alienations, and breaches, as greatly help our cause. Much may be done this way, to prevent the growth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmanual's kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="042104_0007_101B8BA8288707D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means lead ministers to expect more wealth, ease, &amp; respect in the world than they will find. And be sure excite their wives, &amp; families, to expect great things, and find fault if they have them not. Their disappointment, and the vexatious effects of it, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>et and discourage Ministers, and excite uneasi∣ness among people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Above all men in the world, I dread &amp; ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r a Minster that goes into his office, with an humble mind expecting much opposition and self-denial, and determined to follow the example of his master Jesus. Such a man bode; ill to our kingdom. But I perceive that upon hearing our device, some of those d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed ministers now with us in hell, are horribly pierced with anguish. Let us a minute hear their groans &amp; curses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Damned Ministers.</SPEAKER>
<P>These cursed devils were our tempters and sedu∣cers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow they are contriving to bring more after our example to this place of torment, to increase the fire of hell. Ah, cursed fools that we were to go into the ministry for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke of the world, and then indulge our lusts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with divine things, &amp; neglect souls; who thro' our carelessness are now here loading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with their cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, and increasing our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will increase your misery, and bring many of your b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on companions to share with you in the proper fruits and effects of their sloth and luxu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P>But let us return to our proper purpose. O ye prin∣cipalities and powers of hell! If we cannot keep all good men cut of the ministry, let us try to prevent their doing much good when in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We should endeavour to bring ministers into such circumstances that they will be tempted to negli∣gence and sloth in their calling, especially to neglect to visit and talk with people in private, upon spiritual and eternal things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mam.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may in a good measure be accomplished by worldly care, and business taken upon themselves; and people may be very easily led to compel ministers to encumber themselves with the world, or to starve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ministers may be tempted to neglect a clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="8" REF="042104_0008_101B8BAAF47B16D0"/>application to the conscience of their people in pri∣vate, thro fear of offending them, by which offence a minister might lose some part of his worldly income, or suffer reproach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I can succeed with some, to prevent their entering into religious discourse in private houses, by strongly suggesting to them their own weakness and inability to begin or carry on good conversation to advantage. It may be infused into them that it will appear abrupt, strange, and unnatural, not be tho't prudent but rather discover weakness and folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ministers may be tempted to slothfulness in Stu∣dy, &amp; content themselves with a round of old truths, an hundred times repeated; by which we can lead souls into new lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king places of sin and deceit, which such a minister will never discover. Thus souls will rest se∣cure, and come to hell from such a minister, though he preach truth every sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often, and trust I shall yet influence many according to this advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are well agreed hitherto, &amp; have determin∣ed what to do on the part of ministers. But let us pro∣ceed and try what may be done by the people, or lai∣ty, to defeat the design of the gospel ministry among them. And I think one thing in general, should be to prejudice people against, or make them think ill of their minister. If this can be thoroughly done, it will in a great measure defeat the design of the mini∣stry and sabbath both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This advice is worthy the prince of devils. Several things already determined will not fail to have this effect, while ministers live and act as we have proposed. But in prosecution of this design, I would suggest, that some of our worthy friends on earth, the children of Mammon, should industriously spread abroad, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that ministers have too much Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and live too high; that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more at this world than the good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> spend and naughty, and not like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Jesus. These reports are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly managed whether true to prejudice people and prevent
<PB N="9" REF="042104_0009_101B8BADF2BA82E0"/>ministers doing good. And we have always such friends in every city, town, and congregation, who will not fail to make these reports look very plausible, even if false.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We ought to encourage and instigate, those <HI>Friends</HI> which we have in many places on earth, who in opposition to the <HI>Bible,</HI> and the reason and na∣ture of things, will strenuously insist and maintain, that for a minister to have a salary, is to be an hireling, and to preach for wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we can bring people fully to believe, that ministers ought not to have a salary, or stated support, sufficient for their comfortable subsistance, we shall do much to overthrow the ministry; for Clergy∣men, poor wretches, cannot subsist on nothing, any more than their fellow mortals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we can bring people to withhold a proper maintenance, it will keep ministers from many places, where otherwise they would be labouring to pull down our kingdom, as they love to express it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know hundreds of places on earth. that would now have faithful laborious ministers, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people did but approve of them, and would give a comforta∣ble support: but now the stupid people from these pla∣ces. come stocking to these regions of fire, without having been enlightened, warned, and disciplined by a faithful ministry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must by all means, add this propo∣sed discouragement to ministers. for I love to see their hear's sink under a view of the ingratitude of their people, and the little hopes of success among those who render evil for good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have great encouragement upon the view <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so many ways to defeat the design of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel ministers, that fatal means of recovering souls from our kingdom in the upper world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. true heart of cruelty! but we have not done yet. There are further measures to defeat that detestable scheme of Jehovah, and his Missish. Let us proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed we will, my worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I have some time been waiting to propose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="042104_0010_101B8BB1C5F56400"/>that will carry this matter further, in opposition to Je∣sus christ. What I propose is easy to accomplish, that is, to raise evil reports, falshoods, and lies, concerning a minister, especially if he is faithful, and spread these reports among the people. We have friends in every place, male and female, who delight in this work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>These false reports have been very useful to us. But such stories will be most effectual when they have the plausible appearance of truth. Unwary care∣less people, will then readily receive and pass them as Truths. A lye is good for nothing, if it has not the ap∣pearance of truth; especially against a minister of an established chracter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would add something here near a kin to what was last mentioned, viz. to magnify and add to, the real faults of ministers; make mountains of mole hills, and allow nothing for the frailties of human nature in them, but make people think that their fail∣ings unfit them for their calling, and that they may lawfully spread abroad their infirmities. This will pre∣judice people, and sink the hearts of ministers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love to hear the failings of any of Je∣hovah's servants magnified and tossed about; especial∣ly the failings of ministers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have this further to propose, that we should tempt and stir up parents to talk against minis∣ters, before their children. By this the young ones will be prejudiced, and emboldened to contemn, and speak slightly of them; and so the ministry become useless to the rising generation, and we know if people are led to undervalue and slight divine things till they are ad∣vanced in years, there is but little danger of our losing them afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>The advice of Moloch is much to the pur∣pose. I have often observed the effect of it among the young ones, to my great satisfaction. There is G— D—of H—l, has practised according to these sug∣gestions; he repeats over with satisfaction among his children, the falshoods raised and spread abroad con∣cerning his minister and intimates that he has reason to believe they are true. And his children are all ma∣lignant,
<PB N="11" REF="042104_0011_101B8BB3556B0840"/>bold, impudent despisers of their minister, and promise fair to serve us to our mind, as long as they live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary; I know some of those detestable faintish sort of people, who are set to op∣pose our kingdom, who will not before their children so much as whisper any thing against their minister, lest the young ones should be led to slight him, and undervalue the advice he gives them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I know some squeamish creatures, who if they really think their minister is wrong, will not let their children know it, least it should prevent their getting good by his preaching. But we must try to defeat this faintish prudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we can get those falshoods and evil re∣ports of ministers, to the cars of young ones, it will be much to our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpose if they are not conveyed by means of their parents, though I like it best when they come in this channel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have another thing to propose, which we have made much use of in times past: and if times are now altered, that we cannot do as we have done, yet we may do something to excellent purpose in a∣manner but little different.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, brave Moloch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Raise persecution against those hot-headed ministers who set themselves to oppose our kingdom. We have those on earth who are very ready to do this work for us. We have stopped many of their mouths, and shut up many pulpits, which have echoed trea∣son to our kingdom, &amp; by this means intimidated others so as to keep them in some tolerable bounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, times are altered in the world: But sew magistrates, are now inclined to persecute their subjects on account of religion, but much may yet be done by way of persecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We may excite some of our brave friends on earth to injure ministers secretly; burn their hous∣es, destroy their goods, kill their creatures, raise mobs against them, wound, maim them, and the like.

<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>If those opposers of our interest should af∣ter all, make bold; open, resolute attempts, to defeat our design, and oppose any practices which we have promoted among mankind. &amp; the vices &amp; vicious cus∣toms which we have made to prevail, &amp; we cannot persecute them in any other way; we must rise a cla∣mour and noise, make our friends talk big and high, bluster, threaten, and pretend that these ministers are going to turn the world upside down, bring in inno∣vations, and strange regulations and practice, to de∣prive people of their proper liberties and customs. By such means. many that would otherways oppose us, will be affrighted, and choose to be moderate, and hold some degree of friendship with our friends.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: I know many that would have been led to oppose our measures, if some of our bold blus∣tering fellows had not scared them. I am sure we can by this means keep many of those detestable ministers in tolerable order, and make them satisfy their con∣sciences with some moderate reproofs from the pul∣pit, without any real, resolute attempts to oppose us: And if they will but be moderate, our cause is so prevalent in most places, that we have not much reason to fear.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stir up some enthusiastic, deluded, self-conceited people to censure and condemn the minis∣ters of Christ, as carnal unregenerate men and legal preachers. There are numbers of people who thro' the pride of their bearts, ignorance of themselves, and of the nature of religion, think they are more reli∣gious than others: These may be improved as use∣ful servants in our cause; they pretend to great reli∣gion and sanctity, inward light and experience, so that many people really think they have much reli∣gion, and understand it better than common. These pretenders must be excited to censure and condemn ministers as carnal, unregenerate, legal, and dull; that they have not the spirit, and do not preach by experience; that if they have any grace, they have got away from God; that 'tis unprofitable if not dan∣gerous to hear them, yea, that 'tis very dangerous to let awakened persons hear them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right, thou angel of light. There is in that the appearance of religion, that will readi∣ly take with many people who have really some true religion. They will hearken to these high pretenders, and thereby be prejudiced against their ministers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have used many, who are not our real friends, but the subjects of Immanuel, as instruments to do us much service by this project. They have been led to think their ministers ignorant and carnal, and censure them as such, and then the whole weight of those good people's influence goes against the minister; and other people argue thus, "Surely the mi∣nister is carnal and legal, because such an one who is undoubtedly pious, censures him as carnal, which he would not surely do if the minister was spiritual."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>This scheme of opposing religion under a cloak of religion, is a thing I greatly delight in: It has I am sure deluded and kept from the truth, many thousands of souls who are now here with us in hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Damned Souls.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye cursed devils, who once acted as angels of light, who stirred up the pride and self conceit of our corrupt natures, and led us to think
<PB N="14" REF="042104_0014_101B8BBD02606218"/>that religion consisted in what it did not, and made us slatter and delude ourselves, and refuse better light and conviction till it was too late.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did it to prevent your serving and glorifying Jehovah: We did it to disappoint Messiah, and reflect dishonour on him as a Saviour, and bring you to blaspheme him here in hell; and we will still do it to the utmost of our noble powers, and superior wisdom, whilst we find we can employ many ways to counter-act and frustrate his design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find what Lucifer just now proposed, is one of our most successful methods, when there is a revival of religion in the world, &amp; a general concern upon the minds of mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This art and method gives me more sa∣tisfaction, because this way we counteract Jesus Christ when he sends his spirit to convince and awaken peo∣ple. We hereby undermine and defeat a work of grace, and in the end bring great reproach upon vital religion: It prejudices many, and makes them then think there is nothing in experimental religion, but that all is delusion or hypocrisy; because after a while they see these high pretenders turn out to have no re∣ligion, and often prove vicious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is one thing more to our purpose, and that of great importance, and I suppose the rea∣son it has not before been mentioned by some of you, is, that 'tis a thing that we are all very sensible of, and have in all ages attended to, I mean leading mi∣nisters to preach damnable doctrines and build souls upon a foundation that will in the end fail them, and leave them to fall into hell. See what multitudes of damned souls now present, who came here in this way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Damned Souls.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, cursed Devils! Ah, cursed mi∣nisters! Ah, cursed selves! that we who had the bi∣ble, and might have known better, should believe such doctrines as were agreeable to our wicked hearts, our pride, self-righteousness, and the very
<PB N="15" REF="042104_0015_101B8BBE90EEEE30"/>Justs of our nature; and think it was well with us when it was not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are all so sensible of the propriety and success of what Belzebub has mentioned, that we shall always attend to it.</P>
<P>Well, is it not time to proceed to the other thing proposec, viz. the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have one thing more to propose concer∣ning the gospel ministry, and that is, that we by all means lead ministers to dispute with, contradict, and censure one another; yea, contend, quarrel, anathe∣matise, and excommunicate one another. I think we may have great success in this way: Some of those contradictions will tend to unhinge people's minds, especially the weak and ignorant; they will be led to think that as one minister teaches one thing, and a∣nother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other, there is no knowing what religion is, besides it keeps up parties, and illwill, and alienation among ministers and people both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a noble subject to promote our cause. This, Messiah knew, and therefore has said so much to his ministers and disciples, requiring them to love one another, live in peace, be of one mind, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in spite of Mossiah, I have succreded in all ages to promote and keep op jars, contentions, and curses among ministers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, what glorious prospects have we of defeating and dishonouring jehovah! destroying mankind, and keeping low and contemptible the hateful kingdom of jesus Christ on earth! How many ways have we to accomplish our end? My heart feels bellish satisfaction in the prospect of success—I want to hear what will be proposed as to the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sabbath is a day that I hate; it has proved the detestable means of depriving us of many thousans, if not millions of souls. We have before observed, that religion flourishes or falls in proporti∣on as the sabbath is observed or not. 'Tis the hate∣ful day in which people not only hear the word preached, but heads of families catechise and instruct
<PB N="16" REF="042104_0016_101B8BC141E18970"/>their children and servants, and lay in young minds those principles which we find hard to root out. Where this day is observed, we cannot by all our hellish art prevent some truths striking the conscience of sinners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sabbath is the horrible day that suggests so many awakening truths to conscience, that I cannot, as otherways I might, induce souls to sin with boldness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sad truth! On that day the enemies of our kingdom thunder such things in the ears of sinners, and make conscience so timorous, that I cannot suc∣ceed with them as I should if they would live but a few months without a sabbath. I hate the weekly return of that day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon</SPEAKER>
<P>In those cities and places where the sab∣bath is neglected or disregarded, we find almost all the souls come to hell: But where 'tis observed, we lose subjects in a manner that makes me gnash my teeth with rage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are all too sensible of the fatal ten∣dency of that institution. Let us now therefore em∣ploy our infernal wisdom in devising methods, so far as we can to defeat the design of it. And I would propose in the fust place, that we should induce some of our friends on earth by sophistical arguments, and under a pretence of religion, to shew that there is no sabbath by God's appointment under the gospel dispensation: So that by this means people may not think themselves under obligation to observe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is well proposed. If in this respect we can act as angels of light, we shall succeed in the best manner; then conscience will not be alarmed with sabbath breaking, and I dread conscience above any thing on earth. We have those friends among men, some thro' mistake, and some thro' design, who under a pretence or notion of gospel freedom, pro∣claim themselves free from the obligations of the sabbath. We must influence them to insist upon this freedom, and under a notion of being very spiritual, and holy at all times, reject the sabbath as a legal thing, tending to spiritual bondage and superstition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have had a succession of Friends on
<PB N="17" REF="042104_0017_101B8BC5107852E8"/>earth above one hund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed years, who have bravely denied and opposed the sabbath. They have done worthily and had very considerable success. There are many thousands now, who have no regard in their conscience to the sabbath; and if they do not make so much opposition to it as they have done, yet their children are likely to be bro't up in the parents way of thinking: and we hope the number will increase.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have another set of friends the R-g- ns, who bestir themselves with more zeal in our cause, both against the ministry and the sabbath. We must by all means promote and instigate this set of men: They do much wherever they come, to interrupt people upon the sabbath, and prevent the proper exercises of that day: They will make much oppo∣sition, noise and clamour about the sabbath; and will from time to time draw some to their way of thinking, especially the children brought up in their families, will re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain their parent's notions; and if we gain no more than this by it, we should exert our selves to promote this sect to the utmost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve of brother Belial's opinion. But if we could lead these R-g-reens to be a little more subtil and plausible, they would do us more service, for they have acted so zealously for us, that they have in many things gone so contrary to reason and com∣mon sense, that they prevent their doing us so much service as otherways they might.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have another thing to propose respect∣ing the sabbath, that is, that we try to keep up as many different sentiments about it as we can. This will cause divisions, disputes, and confusion. If peo∣ple will have a sabbath, let us try to make them dif∣fer about the day; some hold 'tis one day of the week, and others another; and as much as possible be very confident in their sentiments, and censure &amp; condemn one another. Where there is much dis∣pute and contradiction it keeps people's minds un∣settled, and leads some more careless ones to think, there is not much in the sabbath.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>All good advice, ye princes of hell! But
<PB N="18" REF="042104_0018_101B8BC6A3C53A00"/>still the sabbath will be believed by many; let us therefore consult now we may defeat the design of it where 'tis believed. And I would propose to keep people from public worship, through negligence, sloth or vice: For if people by their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will absent themselves from public worship, and neglect the means God has appointed, the sabbath will not much hurt our interest. I can induce many to ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt themselves through sloth; I find mankind more and more inclined to comply with this temptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apply all your sluggish art brother Da∣gon, induce many to stay at home, and sleep and stretch themselves in ease, at least part of the day, &amp; quiet their consciences with a thought that the sab∣bath was designed for a day of rest.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had, and trust shall still have, won∣derful success in leading people to think that half the day is enough to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end public w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rship: And I fled after they have offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed God by sloth, or some∣thing worse one part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day, there is little danger of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> good the other part, if they do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther temptations which if urged artfully will do much service; particularly, that we have several s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to settle their accounts and adjust their secular business on the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>That proposal ought to be attended to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may be done by degrees. We may at first make them think something of this is necessa∣ry. And when they once begin, the same necessity will lead them to it again and again, till they will not be afraid nor ashamed to make a constant practice of it: Thus not only lawyers, physicians, and mer∣chants, but many others will spend the day in settling and adjusting their accounts, and preparing for more publick business on other days of the week.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="042104_0019_101B8BC9568F8EF8"/>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would propose, that Mammon should tempt people in the country to walk over their fields and plantations on that day, and view their crops, creatures, fences, and the like. This will be more a∣greeable to many than attending public worship: And if any should fault them for not attending the word preached, they can easily excuse themselves, by saying, they can read as good a sermon at home as they can hear at church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must by all means promote and in∣crease a practice, which to the joy of my heart, I find we have already had considerable success in: A prac∣tice which I hope to make make very prevalent; I mean going into company, drinking, gaming, and whoring upon the sabbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have prevailed with many, to prefer this day for visiting their mistresses and prosecuting lewd∣ness: And I think I shall in some places soon make it a principal time for drinking and gaming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis most agreeable to have men spend this day in vain company, drinking, gaming, whor∣ing, and such like practices; because they are then not only guilty of these vices in themselves, but have the additional guilt of sabbath braking, and neglect of publick worship. so that Jehovah is peculiarly dis∣honoured, his laws trampled upon, and his gospel dispised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>What cause have we to rejoice, O ye principalities and powers, that by our wisdom and influence. we can so successfully defeat Jehovah and his Son; that we can bring to mere nothing the gos∣pel ministry and the sabbath, and fill these horrid re∣gions with thousands and millions of Messiah's kin∣dred in the slosh, whose curses and blasphemies are music in our ears Their hearts and tongues are not employed in praising Jehovah, and his Christ, but in accusing and blaspheming, and shall be so to all eter∣nity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy joy: O Lucifer, is worthy the noble powers of hell. But we have not done with the sab∣bath. After all, many will pay some regard to the day, and attend public worship: It remains that we
<PB N="20" REF="042104_0020_101B8BCAE7C76150"/>consider how we shall prevent their getting any good on that day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, I will, suggest to them that as the sabbath is a day of rest, they may lie in bed late that morning, &amp; indulge their case, so that by this means they shall have little or no time for read∣ing or praying; scarce have time to dress, in order to shew themselves at church, and after all, be so late that service shall be great part over, before they arrive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must by all means induce them to employ their tho'ts and spend much time in dressing, decking, and adorning themselves. There is L—. G. and G—. B. and a thousand others, who scarce think of any thing on sabbath morning, except of dressing, and contriving to appear to advantage in public. This is a noble perversion of the sabbath, and con∣tradiction of what Messiah requires of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing I hate worse, than to see some faintish opposers of our kingdom, spend the sabbath morning in reading, meditation, and praying for a blessing on the word to be preached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what we have proposed about dress, several ends are answered, as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. It prevents reading, hearing, and prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. It leads them to idolize themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. It fits them to take the attention of others at church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. It fills them with vanity, and offends their maker, that they are not likely to get much good by preaching.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another thing which we ought by all means to attempt, is, to influence persons to vain and simple discourse in going to, and from the house of God, and between exercises of public worship. Some my be tempted to talk upon, and contrive frolicks; some tell stories; some talk of their farms, oxen, horses, and the like; some of their merchandize, and other business in life, and even innumerable other subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mind being engaged about those things in going to church, will dwell upon them in time of service, so as to neglect any attention to the
<PB N="21" REF="042104_0021_101B8BCFDC417988"/>truths delivered; and we know that no good is got by any preaching that is not attended to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we not to our advantage induce young persons of different sexes, to walk, or fit together, laugh and play, and thus spend the sabbath. This is contrary to the holy design of the day, and so fills the mind with fin and vanity, and there is not much danger that the consciences of such persons will be struck with any truths of the word preached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some people may be induced to make their assembling on the sabbath a season to transact their worldly business: especially they who live dis∣tant in the country. There is D—. Q—. harnesses his carriage, takes a son or two, and sometimes a neighbour, and with cheerful chat passes eight or ten miles to church. There he meets persons with whom he can do many errands, and transact much business. By the opportunity of seeing a number of persons, he does more wordly business that day than he could any other way. He attends church two or three hours, and thinks he is a good Christian, without knowing what Christianity i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We must try to increase this practice: This is so contrary to Je∣hovah's command of not thinking their own tho'ts, nor finding their own pleasures on his day, that he is provoked to leave them to greater hardness or wickedness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is agreeable advice; I would add this further here, viz That after public worship, people who think they dare not allow themselves in vice, should be induced to visit friends and neighbours, be cheerful and talk upon common affairs. This will wonderfully help to banish from the mind any truths that might have some entrance in the time of hearing. It will also prevent their looking into the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, or other books, or attending to any private exercise of worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, that God requires upon the sab∣bath. Many will make these visits without scruple of conference, who would be afraid and ashamed to go in to profane company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your proposals with great
<PB N="22" REF="042104_0022_101B5DEDDA753568"/>satisfaction; but still something remains. In the very time of hearing, when the word is preached and inculcated by our enemies, then is the great danger. Mankind have ears to hear, and they are rational creatures; there are such awakening and affecting truths delivered: Truths that in such an awful and interesting manner concern them, that it seems al∣most impossible that rational creatures should be care∣less, and not attend, and be affected; we cannon our∣selves but wonder that they are not. Let us there∣fore, by all means in the very time of hearing, use all our art, and throw into their minds, without cea∣sing, all sorts of evil thoughts, most suited to their corrupt nature. If we can shield and secure the con∣science in the time of hearing, we shall not have much reason to fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for some. The sermon shall not proceed five minutes, before they shall begin to nod, or lay down their heads and sleep secure; and it shall then be the same to them, whether the truth's deliver∣ed be awakening or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>And let it be thought an affront, or at least an unmannerly or impertinent thing, for any to jog or wake a neighbour in this case. Many are more a∣fraid of offending by awakening others, than of let∣ting them come to hell by sleeping.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nisroch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for numbers. If they sleep not, they shall think as little what the preacher says as if they did. Some shall be fully engaged in viewing the dress and habits of others: New clothes, &amp; new fashions will employ their thoughts; others shall think of themselves and their own dress and finery, and how others view and admire them; others shall be diverted by a roving eye and mind, attending to every thing to be seen and heard, except what the preacher says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for some, who having hearts and eyes of adulters, shall view the objects of their lusts, and have no remorse at letting their hearts run freely upon their sin even in the house of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can do much with some others, by sug∣gesting
<PB N="23" REF="042104_0023_101B8BD41B2EC168"/>worldly covetous thoughts, so that their hearts shall be far enough from the place they are in, or any thing that the preacher says.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>How few will be left to serve Jehovah! Rejoice ye princes of hell.

Oh, how do we wish we could escape hence, if it was but one hour to give notice, to sinners on earth, of the many devices of devils, that the poor souls might not come to this place of torment.</P>

<P>Hah, but you are confined safe enough: We have you here, and her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we will torment you for ever. Not one of you shall depart a moment, to
<PB N="24" REF="042104_0024_101B8BD7DF803580"/>give the least whisper in the ears of any mortal on earth—When your companions come hither they shall know and feel what you now do.</P>

<P>Just at this moment my vision vanished; my trance ceased; I returned to myself, and found all had been but a vision. Yet sure I was it was a real vision, and the views I had were real truths.</P>
<P>And now th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> vision I publish, hoping it may be a warning and do some good. I know the devils will spite me for it: Because I have given notice and warning to poor sinners: have let them see their danger, what snares are laid for them, and in what ways they are like to go to hell. Devil's will hate me for discovering their designs and and plots; but I fear them not, while I trust in God. They cannot go beyond their chain: And, oh, that poor sinners on earth would shun the Devil's snares, and trust in God! they would surely find his help and assistance. If they would resist the Devil, he would be made to fly from them. Jesus Christ is stronger than Satan, and they that trust in him shall overcome the evil one.</P>
<P>If I should hereafter be favoured with any such like vision or discovery of any other of the Devil's designs, I might probably think it my duty to acquaint the world with it; especially if I find mankind make a good use of what is here offered.</P>
