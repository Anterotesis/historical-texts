<HEAD>THE CONFESSION AND Dying Speech of Peter Porcupine, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born in Old England; my grand∣father was a day labourer. He died before I was born; but I often slept beneath the same roof that sheltered him, and where his widow dwelt for several years after his death. It was a little thatched cottage with a garden before the door. Here I and my brothers went every Christmas and Whitsuntide to spend a week or two, and <HI>torment</HI> the poor old woman with our noise and <HI>dilapidations.</HI> Such was my propensity to vice, that I could not resist the temptation to <HI>pilfer</HI> even from my grandmother. In this I discovered a baseness and a depravity which rogues disavow; for they make it a point of honour not to steal from each other. My grand∣father was no philosopher—alas! it would have been well for me if he had been; for then his
<PB N="4" REF="032353_0003_0FF1EEDBE5062E10"/>precepts as well as examples would have instilled principles into my mind, which would have preserved me from the ignominous fate I am about to suffer. The legacies he left, were a large bundle of false keys, a pair of pistols, a dagger and a masque—The false keys he used to open locks with, which were not his own— the pistols were employed to support himself with on the highway—the dagger to put an enemy or a suspected friend <HI>slily</HI> out of the way, and the masque to keep himself from being known when he was engaged in any of his diurnal or nocturnal avocations.</P>
<P>My father when I was born, was of the pro∣fession of my grandfather—The reader will easily believe, from the pursuits of his parents, that he received no very brilliant education: he was however very <HI>ingenious</HI> for a man in his rank of life—When a little boy, he used to pilfer from other boys their chuckers, their marbles, and their tops, and these his earnings were appropriated to the expences of finishing an education which he had begun under a set of sharpers, who held their nocturnal revels in a tavern in the neighbourhood. What these men could be expected to teach, he had learnt, and had besides considerably improved himself in
<PB N="5" REF="032353_0004_0FF1EEDDB0139630"/>several other branches of the <HI>pad.</HI> He under∣stood shop-lifting, pocket-picking, and several other branches of similar sciences well, and was often chosen to draw plans for successful burg∣lary; in short, he had the reputation among his kindred fellows, of possessing experience, cun∣ning, and dexterity, which never fails in <HI>England</HI> to give a man weight with those of his own profession.</P>
<P>So much for my ancestors: from whom, if I derive no honour, I have, alas! inherited a halter.</P>
<P>I had, and I hope I yet have, three brothers— the eldest is a highwayman, the second a pick∣pocket, and the youngest, if alive, is in the service of a set of money coiners. I was born on the ninth of March, 1766. The exact age of my brothers I have forgotten; but I remem∣ber having heard my mother say, that there was but three years and three quarters difference between the ages of the oldest and that of the youngest.</P>
<P>A father like ours, it will be readily suppos∣ed, did not suffer us to eat the bread of idle∣ness. I do not remember the time when I did not earn my living. My first occupation was
<PB N="6" REF="032353_0005_0FF1EEDF745402E8"/>in stealing <HI>potatoes, turnips</HI> and <HI>peas</HI> from the neighbours. When I first trudged a field with my small bag and rum bottle swung over my shoulders, I was hardly able to climb the gates and stiles, and at the close of the day to reach home, was a task of infinite difficulty. My next employment was stealing <HI>fowls, geese, tur∣keys</HI> and <HI>ducks. Picking pockets</HI> followed, and hence I arrived at the honour of joining a gang of burglars. My natural <HI>cowardice</HI> prevented me from taking to the highway. We were all of us liars and rogues, and my father used to boast that he had four boys, of whom the eldest was but fifteen years old, who did as much work as any three <HI>pick pockets</HI> in the parish of Farn∣ham.</P>
<P>It would useless and unentertaining to dwell on the rogueries of a country boy; to lead the reader through gardens and fields, into hen-roosts and hogstyes, where I first gave speci∣mens of my skill; I shall, therefore, come at once to the epoch, that gave that turn to my future life, which at last brought me to the United States and to the gibbet.</P>
<P>It was on the sixth of May 1783, that I sal∣lied forth to seek new adventures. I was dressed
<PB N="7" REF="032353_0006_0FF1EEE1561CEB50"/>in a suit of clothes, which had been purloined by one of my father's companions, in order to accompany two or three dames from a common stew to a fair; but instead of going to the fair, I tricked the lasses and went to London. In this metropolis I amused myself in <HI>picking pockets</HI> and <HI>shop lifting,</HI> till I enlisted early in the year 1784, and as peace had then taken place, no great haste was made to send recruits off to their regiments. The leisure time I had after my enlistment was spent in acquiring as much knowledge as would aid me in the successful pursuits of getting money without labour, and in the course of one year which I devoted to it I learnt more than I had ever done before. My ambition excited in me a wish to be a leader among my brethren of the long fingered tribe, and unless I had more learning and more inge∣nuity than any of them, I could not hope to be successful. This ambition prompted me to de∣vote all my leisure to books, and being natu∣rally acute, I laid the foundation of that know∣ledge and those talents, which I have since my arrival here, faithfully devoted to the service of the king, my master. Before my departure for Nova Scotia I was promoted to the rank of a corporal. We set sail from Gravesend, and after a short passage arrived at Halifax in Nova
<PB N="8" REF="032353_0007_0FF1EEE79B6E0C88"/>Scotia. We staid but a few weeks in Nova Scotia, being ordered to St. John's and New Brunswick. Here and at other places we re∣mained till the month of September 1791, when the regiment was relieved and sent home. During my stay, however, in the new World, I again pursued the drift of my genius and in∣clination and pilfered wherever opportunity offered. The captain of the company to which I belonged had some handsome shirts to which I took a longing, and borrowed a few of them for my own use. In this I was detected, tried by a court martial, sentenced to receive five hundred lashes well laid on, and to be deprived of the rank of corporal. The sentence was inflicted with the utmost rigor, and so severe was the operation that I fainted away at the halberts after receiving about half of the punishment. The remainder of the sentence was delayed for a few days, and then was doubly severe as my back had not recovered from the preceding operation. This will ac∣count for the large sears which I now have on my back. This treatment for so trifling an offence as that of borrowing a few shirts, de∣termined me to take my leave of the regiment as soon as we returned to Old England. We landed at Portsmouth on the third of Novem∣ber,
<PB N="9" REF="032353_0008_0FF1EEEDE71C63E0"/>and on the nineteenth of the next month I <HI>deserted,</HI> after having served not quite eight years.</P>
<P>London was my object and to that I hasten∣ed, and here I gave a full scope to my propen∣sities. The second day after my arrival I picked the pocket of a gentleman of five guineas. A few nights after I associated myself with a set of <HI>burglars,</HI> and we broke open a shop in Cheapside and robbed it of fifty guineas worth of goods and about ten guineas in cash. My next attempt was on the house of a banker, in company with a notorious villain named <HI>Jack Tryall.</HI> We succeeded and robbed the banker of five hundred guineas. This last robbery occasioned considerable alarm, and as a large reward was offered for our apprehension, I de∣termined to take my leave of old England for a time and went to France in March 1792. Paris opened a new field to me, there I intended to exert all my ingenuity; but in this prospect I was suddenly disappointed; for on my arrival at Calais, not having money enough for the journey, I sallied out one evening, and un∣luckily picked the pocket of one of the officers of the police. Unfortunately I was detected in the fact, apprehended, taken before one of
<PB N="10" REF="032353_0009_0FF1EEEFD3EB3E40"/>the tribunals, and sentenced to be whipped a la mode militaire. The old wounds in my back were made to bleed afresh by these cut-throats, and revolutionists. Had not the government been changed and purged of its former ini∣quites I should have escaped so severe a pu∣nishment; but to be arrested in the first step was what I could not, nor ever will forgive. This reception made me change my determina∣tion, and instead of going to Paris, I went in∣to the country. I boarded at a farm house, and supported myself by <HI>dilapidations</HI> from the neigh∣bours. In the neighbourhood were I lived, there lived an Abbe, who had formerly resided in England, where he acquired some know∣ledge of the English language. With him I soon became acquainted, and it was from him that I acquired my knowledge of the French language. I soon discovered in him a kindred spirit, and we early commenced a partnership, and supported ourselves genteely at the expence of the neighbourhood. After our friendship was confirmed he informed me, that he was obliged to fly from England for being concern∣ed in counterfeiting guineas and forging bank∣notes. My friend the Abbe and myself passed our days very happily together in this innocent neighbourhood for near six months, till at
<PB N="11" REF="032353_0010_0FF1EE99DD8A7830"/>length it began to be suspected and whispered that we were the authors of the robberies of which most of them complained. Having al∣ready smarted under the lash of those cursed sans culottes, and cut-throats, and fearing a detection that might expose me to a similar and perhaps a worse fate, I suddenly took my leave and went to <HI>Havre de Grace.</HI> Here I employed myself in my usual occupation till I scraped to∣gether money enough to defray my expences to America, for which I determined to embark. I took a passage to New York and landed there in the month of October 1792.</P>
<P>I have now brought myself to the United States. Alas! it would have been well for me if I had never set foot in any country of liberty and equality! Being without money I determin∣ed to obtain a support in my customary way, and broke open a store in William street, out of which I got some cash and some fine goods. I had, in the short time I remained in that city, acquired sufficient information to know that this mode of employment would not serve me long; that I would soon be detected, and my race would soon be at an end. The money I acquired by the robbery in William street ena∣bled me to take stage for Philadelphia. Here
<PB N="12" REF="032353_0011_0FF1EF07EE3911A0"/>I remained for a short time and then went to Wilmington. At this last place I determined to avail myself of my knowledge of the French language for a support, and became a teacher. The little encouragement I met with, affording but a scanty subsistance, I left Wilmington and returned to this city. Here I began to teach the French language, to translate French into English, and now and then to scribble a para∣graph for <HI>the Gazette of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>In the month of July, 1794, Dr. PRIESTLY landed at New-York. Knowing that the per∣secution of the British government drove him to this country, and knowing at the same time that this would furnish me with an opportunity to panegyrize that government and traduce him, and thereby attract the attention of his Britannic majesty's agents here, and aware that PITT paid well for services rendered him, I wrote a pamphlet entitled <Q>Observations on the Emigration of Dr. JOSEPH PRIESTLY.</Q> No circumstance of my life afflicts me more than this. In this pamphlet I indulged the ran∣cour of a heart too much devoted to vice, and libelled a philosopher and a friend to human nature, the recollection of which embitters my last moments. I abominated his principles be∣cause
<PB N="13" REF="032353_0012_0FF1EF09B9A61268"/>they were favourable to liberty, and every thing like liberty or republicanism, I held in detestation from the moment I had a judgment of my own. An affection for my king was drawn in with my mother's milk, and I have ever cherished a love for monarchy with as much zeal as I did a hatred for liberty. Pov∣erty and inclination thus stimulating me I hoist∣ed the bloody flag against Dr. PRIESTLY. The Observations, as I expected, excited the atten∣tion of one of his majesty's agents. He soon found me out, and we soon understood each other. He told me that the British cause was languishing in this country, and that some ef∣forts must be speedily made or it would be lost forever. He observed further, that the admi∣nistration was well disposed towards Great Bri∣tain, and had a secret detestation of France since the revolution commenced—that a dread of the people only, who were intoxicated with the French Revolution and the Rights of Man, re∣strained them from showing their affection for the one and abhorrence of the other—that the administration had an aversion from republican doctrines and principles, and were endeavour∣ing secretly though surely to assimilate the go∣vernment to that of Great Britain.—To effect objects so desirable and so important to his ma∣jesty
<PB N="14" REF="032353_0013_0FF1EF114DA247B8"/>and his cause, it was necessary to alienate the people from France and subdue their pre∣judices against the mother country.—He con∣ceived that I had talents which might be suc∣cessfully employed to this end—that I had given an evidence of my capacity in the Observations, and that he would furnish materials if I would put them into form. He further remarked with a smile, that I had a talent at <HI>misrepre∣sentation</HI> and <HI>fabrication,</HI> which appeared to him original, and would, if well managed, produce great effects upon the minds of the people. Flattered by these civilities and strongly impres∣sed with a desire to serve my king in whatever country I might be situated, and willing to abandon a mode of life which was attended with so much risque, I enlisted again in the service of my sovereign. Five hundred guineas a year was to be my salary, and if success attended my pursuits, the sum was to be increased. We parted, and he told me at parting, that he would consult some of his friends in the government, obtain their assistance, and in a few days I should hear from him again. In a few days I received a packet from him by a confidential friend of his, containing materials, out of which I form∣ed my "Bone to gnaw for Democrats," and bank notes to the amount of five hundred dol∣lars.
<PB N="15" REF="032353_0014_0FF1EF16F679C918"/>The bone to gnaw was soon ready for the press. It is not necessary here to tell the reader how faithfully I improved the hints which were given me at the interview with his majesty's agent. The five hundred dollars seemed to have had an influence in brightening my genius of which I thought it unsusceptible. Falshood of the most flagrant nature, asserted with the utmost confidence, and glossed over as speciously as possible constituted the essence of my first essay. In a few days after the pub∣lication the agent again called upon me, ex∣pressed himself well satisfied, and said he would supply me with further materials—that a cer∣tain Secretary had promised him an ample stock. He was faithful to his promise, for in a few days I received a large packet, out of which I formed <HI>the second part of the Bone to Gnaw, Plain English, New Year's Gift, Prospect from the Con∣gress Gallery,</HI> and a number of paragraphs for the <HI>Gazette of the United States</HI>—As I mean not to implicate a brother of the type, I will not mention the conversation with the agent rela∣tive to the last mentioned Gazette.</P>
<P>My productions began to excite attention. The agent paid me a third visit, and suggested the propriety of coming forth from my ob∣scurity.
<PB N="16" REF="032353_0015_0FF1EF1ACC25B208"/>My fears were great, I trembled at the idea of being known, lest the falshoods and calumnies I had written should excite the re∣sentment of the populace, and I should become a victim to their rage. He laughed at my fears, told me there was no danger, that the people were a cowardly set and that I should be sup∣ported by some of the first characters in the government. He said that he would advance me any sum to procure me a good house, in a central place, that I might have an appearance of doing business; for, he remarked, if I should be discovered in the place I was, and being engaged in no ostensible business, it might create a suspicion, that I was a British emissary, and all our plans would be frustrated. He proposed a book-store as a proper employ∣ment, which would afford a good cover to our objects. At his solicitation I consented, took a house in a central part of the city at twelve hundred dollars a year, and opened a book store. He advanced half a year's rent to my landlord, and wrote to a staunch friend of his in New York to supply me with books, and that he would be accountable. The books were sent and I opened my eyes to a new scene. Here I began my Political Censor; but as my stock of wit was but small my works began to
<PB N="17" REF="032353_0016_0FF1EF1C9A3AC478"/>sink in the public estimation, and it was neces∣sary some expedient should be hit upon to re∣alize the prospects before me. Having often heard, that persecution was one of the best means in the world to obtain celebrity, and excite the public attention and sympathy, I fa∣bricated a letter, which I conveyed to my land∣lord, in which his house was threatened, and the severest denunciations were made against myself. My landlord swallowed the bait—he brought the letter to me, and I wrote a pam∣phlet upon it called a <HI>"Scare Crow."</HI> At first this letter made considerable noise, and I had a rapid sale for the pamphlet; but in a few days the people began to smoke me, and I again began to totter. Some assertions were made against me in the public prints which it became necessary to contradict, and therefore, I resolv∣ed to give a History of my life and Adventures in which I blended some truth with much fals∣hood. A number of publications issued from the press immediately after the history of my life appeared, and among the number BRADFORD did me infinite injury. He alone was in posses∣sion of some facts much to my dishonour, and he exhibited them to the world with all the malice of a French cut-throat. So much did I
<PB N="18" REF="032353_0017_0FF1EF1E5E59CA68"/>smart under the facts which appeared against me that I began to despair. My friend the a∣gent, however, encouraged me by telling me of the number of friends I had, and by making me liberal allowances. He told me that the moment was critical, that the administration was alarmed, that the friends to Great Britain were in consternation, and that we must perse∣vere in our efforts against France and against republicanism or we should be undone. That the British treaty had been carried to be sure, but that the majority was so small as to excite considerable apprehensions in the administra∣tion. That there was great reason to fear that France would manifest ill temper at our con∣nection with great Britain and the dissolution of our ties with her, and that plans must be laid to secure the ground which had been con∣quered, and to effect a rupture in the end with the French Republic. He said that the go∣vernment was ripe for the event; but the people had such a bias in favour of France, that the experiment would be too hazardous, unless a greater change could be effected in the public mind. He suggested the propriety of commencing a daily paper, as a preferable mode to a monthly work, for accomplishing the
<PB N="19" REF="032353_0018_0FF1EF2434AA96F8"/>object. In support of the establishment of a daily paper he urged the advantages which would arise to me from it; that the officers of the government would aid it with all their influence, and that he would furnish a fund to give it a gratuitous circulation. I promised to take the proposal into consideration, and re∣quested him to allow me some time to think of it.</P>
<P>The expected explosion from the French Republic at length took place through her mi∣nister ADET. He suspended his functions by order of the Executive Directory, and stated the grounds of resentment to the world. Al∣though the people were much alarmed at this event, the Administration were undismayed— things were working according to their plans and wishes. To make their purposes more secure, PINCKNEY had been sent to supersede MONROE. They were well apprised that the new minister could not be received agreeably to national etiquette, and the existing state of things, and the refusal would prove a strong argument to break entirely with the French Republic. The train was well laid and nothing was wanting but the match of time to give the explosion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032353_0019_0FF1EF27A14F7740"/>
I continued my Censor and occasionally gave a political blunderbuss, till the meeting of Con∣gress. After Congress were in session a com∣munication was made to them on French af∣fairs. A long letter <HI>signed</HI> by the Secretary of State, and addressed to the minister PINCKNEY accompanied the communication. This letter was exactly in the stile which my friend the agent suggested, and was well calculated to fa∣vour the contemplated rupture. The adminis∣tration was determined, my friend told me, (for he was in their confidence) at all events to break with France, and to form an alliance with great Britain. To this end the letter was written and published, and to this end all their measures tended. Encouraged by such flatter∣ing appearances, I resolved to publish a daily paper, that I might contribute my means to ac∣complish the design, and accordingly published my proposals. My subscription was rapid and great. Officers of government, clergymen and tories seemed to vie with each other in my sup∣port. The reverend <HI>Mr. Abercrombie</HI> assisted me in obtaining subscriptions, and was always ready with his aid and counsel. He professed great affection for me and for the cause I was embarked in, and seemed to relish the obsceni∣ties
<PB N="21" REF="032353_0020_0FF1EF295E17FAC0"/>I now and then indulged in, as much as any of my patrons. No one can accuse him of being starched.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to state in this place, the temper of my paper—the libels, the falshoods and the indecencies it contained. At one mo∣ment I libelled the Governor, at another Mr. MONROE, and so I went on through the whole catatlogue of American patriots. Every falshood which my inveteracy to the United States for their former rebellion, to the French Republic, and to republicanism could supply, was dealt out with a lavish hand. Finding that some little irrita∣tion had taken place in the public mind against the depredations upon our commerce by French cruisers, I determined to try the temper of it, and if possible by one bold stroke, give a com∣plete ascendancy to the British interest. To effect this I wrote a letter containing an account of an association of <HI>Democrats</HI> to join the French in case of an attempt upon this country, and to give this letter the appearance of reality I signed it GEORGE WILSON, sen'r. I employed a confidential friend to copy this letter and to convey it to my letter-box. Lest it might be supposed a forgery, I took care to have evidence
<PB N="22" REF="032353_0021_0FF1EF2B2035F4D8"/>at hand when I received the letter, to vouch for my having received it. The letter was pub∣lished with all imaginable solemnity; but the effect disappointed me. Instead of seeing a violent tumult, and an immediate arrestation of the leading Democrats, I was summoned to ap∣pear before the Mayor of the city to answer for the publication. My consternation at this unexpected turn was indescribable. My cow∣ard heart was ready to die within me. Here∣tofore I never left my own house but under cover of the night or of a fog, or before I had previously reconoitered the street, and saw that all was safe; and to be obliged now to appear in propria personae, and that too before a legal tribunal, almost petrified me, I felt my heart in my breeches. My clerical friend and the agent called upon me and bade me be of good cheer. At the office of the mayor I was obliged to an∣swer a number of interogatories; but contrary to my expectation, I was treated with great at∣tention by some of the persons present, which explained the words of my friend the agent when he bade me be of good cheer. Instead of the punishment which I expected for the for∣gery, I was dismissed with politeness, and return∣ed home with a heart as light as a feather.
<PB N="23" REF="032353_0022_0FF1EF31368513B8"/>Finding myself thus patronized, and finding that the interest of the king my master was substantially supported by men in authority, I determined to publish another Censor, to which I annexed my last will and testament, or my last libel upon the patriotic Americans. Little did I then imagine that what was suggested by a sportive imagination, was a presentiment of my end. This last effort was too audacious— it excited general indignation and caused an in∣formation to be lodged against me of a conspi∣racy against the government. I was arrested, my papers were seized and <HI>the plan discovered, to subjugate this Country to the power of great Bri∣tain.</HI> I was tried for high treason, convicted and sentenced to be hanged and my body to be delivered to the professor of anatomy for dissection. Thus have I arrived at life's gole, and thus am I rewarded for an uninterrupted course of infamy and wretchedness. I hope my unhappy fate will prove a warning to others and that an ignominious end will make some atonement for the crimes of my life. My object was, and I now solemnly confess it in the pre∣sence of an offended Deity, to re-establish the British dominion in this country, and to restore the United States again to their dependance
<PB N="24" REF="032353_0023_0FF1EF350AD20118"/>upon great Britain, and to accomplish this I traduced the character of FRANKLIN and of PAINE, and of every patriot who aided in the revolution, and have remained faithful to his first purpose. To effect an object so desirable I sneered at the late revolution and endeavour∣ed to throw disgrace upon it and the actors in it, as my writings will testify. The <HI>Democrats</HI> were my abhorrence for they were in the way of my plans. They were constantly on the watch, and often sounding alarm. Had it not been for their machinations, my life would not at this moment be so near its close, neither would the plans of my employers have proved abortive. My last breath shall be spent in curs∣ing them for foiling me, in cursing the Ameri∣can and French Revolutions and every thing that looks like republicanism, or liberty and equality.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Now heav'n fulfil my curses on their heads!</L>
<L>May ev'ry purpose of their souls be frustrate!</L>
<L>May infamy and ruin o'ertake them!</L>
<L>May base captivity and chains overwhelm them!</L>
<L>May shameful crimson from their shoulders start,</L>
<L>Like mine dishonor'd by the servile scourge!"</L>

<HEAD>EXECUTION AND DISSECTION OF <HI>PETER PORCUPINE.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WITH A GLOSSARY, BY THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>ON Saturday last made his exit, owing to a hempen neck-cloth being drawn too tight∣ly about his neck, on the public square near the Centre-house, one of PITT'S hirelings, known by the name of PETER PORCUPINE. He appeared to have had a presentiment of his fate, whether from an accusing conscience, or from some intimation given him by his friend <HI>Belze∣bub,</HI> cannot now be known; but such was his impression of the approaching and awful mo∣ment, that he made his <HI>last</HI> will and testament, in which he intended some atonement for his life, by bequeathing his body for dissection. As the causes of diseases are very often discovered by dissection, and remedies are found out by the ascertainment of the causes, it seemed to be his opinion, that there either might exist a phy∣sical derangement, by which moral infirmity was excited, and which might be remedied by a knowledge of the cause; or he deemed a sub∣mission of his carcase to the knife, as all the atonement he could make for the transgressions
<PB N="26" REF="032353_0025_0FF1EF389130B9F0"/>of his life, and therefore doomed himself to the exposure and fate of a <HI>felon.</HI> He was attended on his visit to the public square by a would be divine, his particular friend and counsellor, and who was converted into an apostolic missionary as suddenly after the failure in a cashiership, as St. Paul was on his way to Damascus, though not by the same invisible agent. This <HI>pious</HI> priest and <HI>news-boy</HI> endeavoured to comfort him, by talking to him of a paradise, of which he knew little, and about grace, of which he knew less; but Peter was like Rachel, who wept over her lost children, and would not be comforted. Despair, the consequence of an over-load of guilt, had seized him, and the apparent agony of his mind excited the sympathy of an injured people. Like CLIVE, his eyes longed for mer∣cy; but like him, despair only was to be found. His fate was the most eloquent and pathetic lecture on morality and religion, perhaps, that ever was delivered. BOSSUET, in his famous funeral oration on Mary of Austria, the queen of France, was not so eloquent, nor so impressive.</P>
<P>Agreeably to his own will and testament, and in conformity to a certain other decree, his body was delivered to the anatomical professor for dissection, which exhibited the folloing phae∣nomena:—</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032353_0026_0FF1EF3DF0C997F0"/>
On the back was a cluster of <HI>long scars;</HI> they appeared like the cicatrices from deep scarifica∣tions: the professor supposed them to have been occasioned by <HI>a cat o' nine tails,</HI> as he once dis∣covered the same appearance on the back of a British soldier, who had been severely whipped some time before his death. On opening the <HI>thorax</HI> a foetor issued so offensive as to be nearly intolerable. It resembled the smell from a dog in a state of putrefaction. On removing the <HI>sternum</HI> the thoracic viscera exhibited a most extraordinary and unnatural appearance. The <HI>lungs</HI> were of a crimson colour, composed of three lobes, the third lobe occupying the place of the <HI>mediastinum.</HI> They were of enormous size. On making an incision into them a vapour arose which benumbed the faculties of the by∣standers. On applying a candle near the orifice, it was extinguished. A mouse was held over the lungs and he instantly expired. These phoe∣nomena led to an opinion, that the air, which had been contained in the lungs, was of the same kind with that in the <HI>grotto del cani</HI> near Naples, rendered famous by the destruction of <HI>dogs,</HI> called formerly <HI>gas silvestre,</HI> but known at present by the name of the <HI>aerial or cretaceous acid.</HI> A strong sulphureous stench arose from the lungs; they were soon removed with a pair of tongs, and
<PB N="28" REF="032353_0027_0FF1EF44333223E0"/>thrown into the vault. The thorax seemed to be exclusively allotted to the lungs, for no other viscus was to be found. Nothing remarkable appeared about the pleura.</P>
<P>On opening the <HI>abdomen</HI> the first thing which discovered itself was the <HI>spleen,</HI> of an enormous size; it supplied the place of the <HI>stomach,</HI> ex∣tended itself across the abdomen, and occupied a considerable portion of the hypogastric region. It adhered to the <HI>diaphragm.</HI> On making an incision into it, a yellow mist arose, which ting∣ed and distorted every object; the effluvia had a remarkable effect on the bye-standers; they no longer saw in each other same persons; they became fretful and peevish, and would have quarrelled with each other, had not the pro∣fessor interposed, and by ordering the windows and doors to be thrown open, dissipated the mist and restored the persons to their original appearance. The <HI>oesophagus</HI> entered at the left orifice, which in the stomach is known by the name of <HI>cardia</HI> and the <HI>rectum</HI> began at the right orifice know by the name of <HI>pylorus.</HI> There was but one <HI>intestine,</HI> which might be called the <HI>rectum,</HI> as it formed the <HI>anus.</HI> It was a straight gut, and had no <HI>valves,</HI> by which it appeared that its contents could be discharged either upwards or downwards.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032353_0028_0FF1EF460C3DD9A0"/>
The <HI>liver</HI> was of unusual size, and of a sooty colour. On its concave side, beginning at its upper part and extending itself as low down as the fissure, was the <HI>gall bladder,</HI> of the dimen∣sions of an ordinary urinary bladder. It was in a state of extreme distension. On making an incision into it, a mud coloured fluid issued from it extremely fetid. Two <HI>ducts</HI> communicated with the <HI>gall bladder;</HI> one from the <HI>oesophagus,</HI> and the other from the <HI>rectum.</HI> On opening the convex surface of the liver, a large <HI>sac</HI> dis∣covered itself, in which was contained a num∣ber of small living animals resembling <HI>toads.</HI> There was a communication between this sac and the gall bladder, by means of a duct. On being exposed to the light, these toad-like ani∣mals expired, apparently in convulsive agonies.</P>
<P>Between <HI>the bladder</HI> and <HI>the anus,</HI> a small black substance attracted attention, which was somewhat larger than a grape-shot. On exami∣nation, it was found to be <HI>a heart,</HI> enveloped in a <HI>pericardium,</HI> which at first resisted the knife. After some difficulty the pericardium was re∣moved, and a fluid resembling coffee grounds was discharged, which on examination appear∣ed to be a substance similar to the excrementi∣tious matter from <HI>a hog.</HI> The heart, which was little larger than that of <HI>a chicken,</HI> had a
<PB N="30" REF="032353_0029_0FF1EF4A2E6D5870"/>livid appearance, and in many places gangre∣nous spots. Both <HI>auricles</HI> and <HI>ventricles,</HI> as well as the <HI>pulmonary artery,</HI> the <HI>aorta,</HI> and the <HI>venoe cavoe,</HI> were charged with a dark coloured fluid resembling putrid bile. From the situation of the heart it might be said literally to have been <HI>in his breeches.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>pancreas,</HI> or <HI>sweet bread,</HI> appeared either not to have existed or to have been totally ob∣literated.</P>
<P>The <HI>cranium,</HI> or <HI>scull,</HI> almost baffled the ef∣forts of the surgeons, it was of such immense <HI>thickness</HI> and solidity. Several saws were ruined by it.—On removing it, the <HI>dura</HI> and <HI>pia mater</HI> made equal resistance to the scalpel; they seem∣ed to be formed of <HI>corneous</HI> matter. The <HI>brain</HI> was about the size of a goose's egg. There was no <HI>cerebellum;</HI> the little which appeared was <HI>cerebrum</HI> only. On cutting into the <HI>cerebrum</HI> it was hollow, and in the cavity were myriads of small animals, which on examination with a glass resembled <HI>tad-poles.</HI> The fluid which che∣rished them was of a mud colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>tongue</HI> was bifurcated and perforated. At the root of it were two small bags, the one con∣taining a fluid like that in the gall bladder; the other like that contained in the spleen. Each of these bags had a duct which entered them from the oesophagus.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032353_0030_0FF1EF4DCBDAA718"/>
The <HI>ears</HI> had no <HI>lobes</HI>—They appeared to have been pared away by a sharp instrument.</P>
<P>The foregoing is a short but accurate account of the dissection of PETER PORCUPINE, and the phoenomena which his carcase discovered. To the ingenious and the learned will be left the solution of the extraordinary appearances.</P>
