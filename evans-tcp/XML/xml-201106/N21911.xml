<DATE>June <HI>29, 1795.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVE seen in your paper of this date an abstract of the Treaty between the United States and Great-Britain, which, though not perfectly correct is nearly so.</P>
<P>As this pablication will probably excite a newspaper discus∣sion, it is of importance that the people should possess a full and accurate knowledge of the subject to which their attention may be drawn, and which I think has already been improperly with∣held from them. Lest therefore, the Treaty should be presumed more favorable, or be represented to be less so than it really is, I send you herewith a genuine copy, which you may correct your statement by, or make such other use of as you please, for the pur∣pose of giving to the citizens of America full information re∣specting this momentous business.</P>

<LG>
<L>THOU great descendant of that wondrous man,</L>
<L>Whose genius wild thro' all creation ran—</L>
<L>That man who walk'd the world of Science o'er,</L>
<L>From ink and types to where the thunders roar—</L>
<L>To thee, friend Bache, these lines I now address,</L>
<L>Prepar'd on purpose for thy hallow'd press.</L>
<L>I've pick'd thee out because I highly prize,</L>
<L>Thy grandfire's memory, and thy knack at lies,</L>

<L>Among those sons perhaps not one remains</L>
<L>More worthy Franklin's <HI>accidental</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Otherwise called</HI> come-by-chances.</NOTE> pains,</L>
<L>Than thee, <HI>Ben. Franklin Bache</HI>—to faction's soul,</L>
<L>Dear as the streams which through life's channels roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In thy blest paper, which like clouds of night,</L>
<L>Shuts in the darkness, and shuts out the light,</L>
<L>I've seen an abstract of the treaty dire,</L>
<L>Design'd to light the democratic fire.</L>
<L>As that has had full time to work its way,</L>
<L>And call the public spirit into play,</L>
<L>Before their passions have a chance to flag,</L>
<L>I'll let the cat jump out the senate bag.</L>
<L>For ten long days my soul has been confin'd,</L>
<L>My tho'ts all shackled, chain'd my free-born mind,</L>
<L>No damn'd black negro e'er was closer pent,</L>
<L>Nor strain'd new cider harder for a vent.</L>
<L>'Tis true that all the time the senate sate,</L>
<L>I did not figure greatly in debate;</L>
<L>Indeed I did not <HI>once</HI> attempt to speak;</L>
<L>But my heart's sound, altho' my head is weak—</L>
<L>And yet, in this respect I'm not alone,</L>
<L>Eight other tongues were silent as my own,</L>
<L>Save once when <HI>Johnny Langdon</HI> silence broke,</L>
<L>And for the space of <HI>half a minute</HI> spoke;</L>
<L>But finding out that he had started wrong,</L>
<L>He seal'd thenceforward his uneasy tongue;</L>
<L>On <HI>Burr</HI> alone our hopes and wishes lay,</L>
<L><HI>Burr</HI> was our spokesman, counsellor, and stay;</L>
<L>In him we trusted for the last relief,</L>
<L>In times of trouble, and in hours of grief.</L>
<L>In short you'll be astonish'd when you know,</L>
<L>How far our party first and last would go—</L>
<L>Old <HI>Robinson,</HI> borne down with faction's care,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="028855_0004_0FDE0F51A471DD50"/><HI>As usual,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As a proof that this Senator relies <HI>generally</HI> upon divine assistance, the following story is related of him. One of his bro∣ther Senators, whose political tenets differed widely from Mr. Robinson's, taxed him with having propagated a story about him which injured his character. The old man found himself in difficulty; and knew no better way to get out than to evade the conversation. Accordingly, he told the gentleman, that it had given him great pain that they should differ in sentiment—that in consequence of that pain, he had often prayed to heaven, that if he was wrong, he might be led to think like the gentle∣man—or if the gentleman was wrong, that he might be led to think like Mr. Robinson—for he could not bear to think different∣ly from such a sensible man, even if that man was wrong in his opinions.—</NOTE> tried to help himself by prayer;</L>
<L>But finding heaven had turn'd a deafen'd ear,</L>
<L>No deign'd to answer nor appear'd to hear,</L>
<L>As <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> turn'd to <HI>Burr</HI> his course,</L>
<L>And gain'd relief from that more handy source.</L>
<L>But tho' we could not reason quite so strong,</L>
<L>Discuss so ably and declaim so long,</L>
<L>Yet we'll convince them on the other side,</L>
<L>That our free tongues no longer shall be tied;</L>
<L>No haughty senate by its tyrant laws,</L>
<L>Shall longer lock our democratic jaws.</L>
<L>Perish their secrets!—laws were made for fools—</L>
<L>True democrats despise the senate and their rules.</L>
<L>In pure republics secrets ne'er exist,</L>
<L>Knowledge, like wind, should blow where'er it list,</L>
<L>No man can claim a right <HI>exempt</HI> to know,</L>
<L>Science and truth in common streams should flow,</L>
<L>Where each at will his parched bill may dip,</L>
<L>And as occasion calls enjoy a sip.</L>
<L>Thus borne away a drop by every hand,</L>
<L>Knowledge will bless each corner of the land.</L>
<L>Hard very hard would be the poor man's lot,</L>
<L>If every one might hoard up all he'd got,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="028855_0005_0FDE0F52FAB5FFB0"/>And thus establish o'er these happy plains,</L>
<L>A dreadful aristocracy of brains,</L>
<L>From which no <HI>common man</HI> his 'rights' may draw,</L>
<L>Without transgressing some despotic law.</L>
<L>We're all determined, WE, 'the virtuous TEN,'</L>
<L>The <HI>major</HI> part of thirty <HI>common men.</HI></L>
<L>For by the rules of democratic lore,</L>
<L>Twenty is less than ten by three or four—<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The common principle in Representative governments, <HI>"that the majority shall decide,"</HI> seems to have a singular construction among our democrats. In common cases one more than half is a majority. In the case of establishing Treaties, the Constitution requires <HI>two thirds.</HI> Still these <HI>patriotic</HI> De∣mocrats would persuade us that we ought to obey <HI>one third,</HI> let <HI>two thirds</HI> say what they may. It is this kind of majority that the Democrats in the United States compose. However what they want in numbers <HI>they say</HI> they have in <HI>merit.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>I say, that we're determin'd, one and all,</L>
<L>That JAY'S vile treaty to the ground shall fall.</L>
<L>The subject we expect will raise a heat,</L>
<L>In every town where clubs and traitors meet.</L>
<L>From thence extend itself from shore to shore,</L>
<L>'Till peace and government exist no more.</L>
<L>For well the truths of sage experience show,</L>
<L>That Faction's plants in towns and cities grow;</L>
<L>For there collect the refuse of mankind,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for treasons, and for plots design'd.</L>
<L>There every traitor hides his forfeit head,</L>
<L>There finds protectors, and there looks for aid,</L>
<L>There noisy demagogues their standards raise,</L>
<L>Sedition's sparks there kindle to a blaze.</L>
<L>O thou, my native land! by heav'n design'd;</L>
<L>As the last refuge for the human kind—</L>
<L>The land, where Freedom builds her blest abode,</L>
<L>Where lavish Nature all her blessings strew'd,</L>
<L>Where Health and Plenty hand in hand appear,</L>
<L>And Pleasure wantons thro' the varied year—</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="028855_0006_0FDE0F5D900545C8"/>Oft thy horizon black'ning storms o'er cast,</L>
<L>And bend thine honors to the sweeping blast;</L>

<L>The plot of traitors, and the lies of hell;</L>
<L>To <HI>Bradford,</HI> JARVIS, <HI>Madison</HI> and Giles,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Adam's</HI> weakness, and old <HI>Clinton's</HI> wiles.</L>
<L>But to return—examine all this TEN,</L>
<L>And see if they don't form a set of men,</L>
<L>On whom their country's happiness may rest,</L>
<L>Safe as a secret in a gossip's breast.</L>
<L>First General <HI>Jackson</HI>—he's a fiery blade,</L>
<L>By <HI>nature</HI> honest—but <HI>so so</HI> by trade.</L>
<L>His eye-sight reaching only to his nose,</L>
<L>He thinks the world beyond is fill'd with woes,</L>
<L>And thus beclouded mid a flood of light,</L>
<L>Each object startles, empty sounds affright;</L>
<L>While by this maxim he has acted long—</L>
<L><HI>"What I can't see thro' certainly is wrong."</HI></L>

<L>North-Carolina counts her number TWO,</L>
<L>Who each can lift the hand, and make a shew.</L>
<L>Farther than this, they do as they are bid,</L>
<L>And follow wheresoe'er their masters lead.</L>
<L>Ah, <HI>Thomson Mason!</HI> long thy fame shall rise,</L>
<L>With democratic incense to the skies,</L>
<L>Long shall the world admire thy manly soul,</L>
<L>Which scorn'd the haughty Senate's base controul,</L>
<L>Came boldly forward with thy <HI>weightyn ame,</HI></L>

<L>Expecting doubtless that thy praise would sound,</L>

<L>Yet honest men with indignation fraught,</L>
<L>Will search thy bosom to the inmost tho't,</L>
<L>And on thy brow will fix a deeper stain,</L>
<L>Than ting'd the murderous front of guilty Cain.</L>
<L>Thy Colleague is a decent sort of man,</L>

<L>That when this publication shall come out,</L>
<L>Our countrymen will in a ferment glow,</L>
<L>And wage dire war where'er news-papers go.</L>
<L>Long has the Treaty lurk'd beneath the shade,</L>
<L>And long the work of mischif been delay'd;</L>
<L>But, as such game don't offer every day,</L>
<L>I'll throw it out and see the bull dogs play.</L>

<L>'Or soon our 'self-created Club' shall fall,</L>

<L>'Big with the fate of Cato and of Rome.'</L>
<L>From every hole, behold the shabby throng,</L>
<L>To Faneuil-Hall creep anxiously along—</L>
<L>A Club, which Treaties never knew, nor saw,</L>
<L>A Club, known better to the civil law;</L>
<L>Too poor to profit should the Treaty stand,</L>
<L>Too poor to lose, if Ruin whelms the land;</L>
<L>But proper tools for <HI>Jarvis</HI> to employ,</L>
<L>Fit tools to riot, pillage, and destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now loud and clamorous the debate begins—</L>
<L><HI>Jarvis</HI> his thread of tropes and figures spins;</L>
<L>And often pauses, often calls aloud,</L>
<L>To every member of the gaping croud,</L>
<L>To shew him if the Treaty should go down,</L>
<L>Why Faction's hopes were not forever flown.</L>
<L><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">To prove that he responds faithfully, the Echo has here taken the first person.</NOTE> 'And here my friends, I solemnly declare.</L>
<L>(And by your looks I shall not make you stare)</L>
<L>'Tis not John Jay that calls your speaker here,</L>
<L>'Tis not against the treaty I appear—</L>
<L>To read it thro' I ne'er have taken pains,</L>
<L>And scarcely know a sentence it contains—</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="028855_0015_0FDE0F8F33AA1EB8"/>But Government—'tis Government I dread,</L>
<L>Which hangs like Sinai o'er the pilgrim's head.<NOTE N="¶¶" PLACE="foot">See Bunyan.</NOTE></L>
<L>The time is come when Jacobins must make</L>
<L>Their last exertions for Sedition's sake,</L>
<L>When Federal measures, Federal men must fall,</L>
<L>Or Ruin seize ourselves, our plans and all.</L>
<L>This Treaty cuts us off from every chance</L>
<L>Of fighting <HI>Britain,</HI> and of helping <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>Of course, no hope of war will then remain,</L>
<L>And we must be content with peace again.</L>
<L>Now who would wish to settle down in peace,</L>
<L>To see his wealth, and happiness encrease?</L>
<L>And yet, so long as government shall stand,</L>
<L>T'will spread its terrors o'er this dastard land,</L>
<L>And when in wisdom IT shall choose <HI>to say,</HI></L>
<L>We democrats must tremble and obey.</L>
<L>A dismal proof of this we lately saw,</L>
<L>When Faction yielded, and when triumph'd Law;</L>
<L>When boldly rang'd along Rebellion's field,</L>
<L>Our Whisky-brethren rais'd the daring shield,</L>
<L>While all our Clubs with expectation view'd,</L>
<L>The hopeful prospect of a time of blood;</L>
<L>When low in dust our Government should lie,</L>
<L>And peace and safety from our country fly—</L>
<L>When true French Freedom, from the abys of hell,</L>
<L>On misery bent, and ravening fierce to kill,</L>
<L>Arm'd with her bloody knife and flaming brand,</L>
<L>Should roll her car tremendous o'er the land.</L>
<L>But soon appear'd great Freedom's awful form—</L>
<L>Still grew the thunder, disappear'd the storm,</L>
<L>Back shrunk Rebellion from her flashing sight,</L>
<L>And all our prospects vanish'd into night.</L>
<L>Now I'm for living free, entirely free,</L>
<L>God never made a man to govern me;</L>
<L>And hence this inference I most clearly draw—</L>
<L>That we may prostrate government and law.</L>
<L>And let us now the glorious work begin,</L>

<L>He wish'd delay—delays must not be had,</L>
