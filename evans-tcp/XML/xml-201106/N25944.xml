<HEAD>THE <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the North of England lived a gentle∣man and lady of the name of Davenport; they had two boys and two girls. Mrs. Da∣venport took care herself of the education of her daughters, whilst her husband attended to that of the boys. These children were very good and dutiful to their parents; and, indeed, it would have been a shame had they been otherwise.</P>
<P>Their names were,

<ITEM>CHARLES, <HI>thirteen years old,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>MARY, <HI>twelve,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="4" REF="034505_0004_0FFE09799982F1E0"/>
GEORGE, <HI>eleven,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>CAROLINE, <HI>nine.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Though their house was several miles dis∣tant from any town, yet it had the advantage of a very good neighborhood; this, however, did not last all the year, as most of the fami∣lies who lived thereabout, spent the winter in London: yet, during this dreary season, our little family wished not for more society than was to be found under their own roof; they were always happy and cheerful within themselves. Mrs. Davenport had a brother, who was a widower, with two daughters: Sophia and Amelia Easy. Having occasion to visit the continent, he begged the favor of his brother and sister to take care of them during their absence from school at Christ∣mas. This request was readily complied with; and, accordingly, when the holidays were nearly arrived, Mr. Davenport set off for London, to convey these young ladies from thence down to his own house. Mary and Caroline expected the arrival of their cousins
<PB N="5" REF="034505_0005_0FFE09BD27245320"/>with a deal of pleasure. During the week that Mr. Davenport was absent, their leisure hours were employed in making up new clothes for their dolls, and getting all their playthings in order. At length, the happy day arrived, their papa returned, and intro∣duced Sophia and Amelia to them; hoping that they would be good friends, and love one another as sisters.</P>
<P>Sophia Easy was fourteen years old, Amelia was twelve. They had the misfortune to lose their mother when they were very young, and having been from that time brought up at one of the first schools, great attention had been paid to their French, mu∣sic, and other accomplishments, but they were girls of very perverse and wayward dis∣positions. Sophia was very proud and unwil∣ling to take any advice, haughty to servants, and impertinent to her superiors; at school she had connected herself with a set of those silly girls who laughed at every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knew better than themselves, and tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s∣ed
<PB N="6" REF="034505_0006_0FFE097B210B6190"/>over those who would not enter into their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>diculous schemes. Amelia was vain and conceited; she never let slip an opportunity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admiring herself in a looking glass, and, had the time been allowed her, would with pleas∣ure have spent the whole morning at her toi∣let. Besides these foibles, they had each of them contracted a habit of telling falsehoods. Such were the Miss Easys, and from what I have said of the little Davenports, my young readers will readily suppose that they were not much pleased with their visitors.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport read short prayers to the whole family every night, which were always over by nine o'clock, when the children went to bed. They rose at six in summer, and at eight in winter; though used to earlier hours at school, Sophia and Amelia did not chuse to get out of bed till past eleven. Mrs. Davenport took no notice of this the first morning, thinking that the journey had fa∣tigued them; but the next day when the clock struck eleven, and they had not made their appearance, she went up stairs and gent∣ly reproved them, adding, that she hoped
<PB N="7" REF="034505_0007_0FFE09BEADB0C700"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would not happen again. The moment she quitted the room, "Come," says Amelia to her sister, "let us get up, or she will be coming again to pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e us." "Let her come," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; "we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pretend to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>."</P>

<P>"Ah, but she will find us out!"</P>

<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>And what if she does? she has no right to punish us.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>After this they continued their conversation for a long time, till it was interrupted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entrance of Caroline; who, coming towards the bed, and gently undrawing the curtains, "Come, my dear cousins," said she, "pray get up; for if you stay up stairs any long∣er you will vex mama, and I am sure you would not wish to do so." "I don't care whether she is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or not," said Sophia; "what is it to <HI>her</HI> how long we lay in bed?" This was the first time Caroline had ever heard her mama spoken of slightingly; it hurt her, and she quickly answered, <Q>My mama is very good,
<PB N="8" REF="034505_0008_0FFE097DE9C5E8A0"/>and is never angry or vexed without reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> If we get up, it will be of our own accord,</Q> said Amelia; <Q>we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot do it a bit the sooner for <HI>her.</HI></Q> "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you please," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ned Caroline; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to avoid a quarrel, hastily left th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom; but recollect∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g that her cousins might want some help, she came back and offered her assistance; it was accepted, and, when they were dressed, she conducted them to the breakfast room. "This is a very late hour for breakfast," said Mrs. Davenport, as they entered the room; we are a regular family, and it must not "happen again." "What," said Sophia, "are we to get up by <HI>four?</HI>" "I did not say <HI>four,</HI>" replied Mrs. Davenport, rather displeased at her pertness; "but nine is our breakfast hour, and those who are not down by that tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust go without." This was spoken in so resolute a manner that it totally silenced her nieces. They soon fin∣ished their breakfast, and Mary took them to walk in the grounds. The sharpness of the
<PB N="9" REF="034505_0009_0FFE09C174167900"/>weather, however, soon brought them back again; Mary then produced some dissected maps, but they would not suffer her even to open them; saying, that they had enough of geography at school, and that they did not intend to study in holiday time. "Study, do you call it?" said Mary; "well you can∣not imagine how we all like it, for papa teaches us; and we find it very entertaining; however, if you do not like it, we will find out some other amusement; will you go up stairs and play with our dolls?" "D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you take us for babies?" said Amelia. "I am sure I did not mean to affront you," re∣plied Mary; "and I do not know what else to offer you.—Stay—now I think of it, there is a great book of prints in the study, will you come and look over them?" Pray can't you fetch them?" said Amelia.</P>

Just then Mrs. Davenport entered the room:— "What my dear Mary," said she, <Q>can you find nothing to entertain your cousins with?—Where are your Maps?</Q></P>

<P>"They do not like them, mama."</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>A continent—a continent—is a vast tract of water.</Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I beg your pardon; <HI>land</HI> and <HI>water</HI> are two very different things. Never again, my dear Amelia, pretend to more knowledge than you really have. 'Tis a common remark, that those who make the greatest parade of their learning, generally prove, upon examination, the most ignorant.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>Mrs. Davenport then proposed a walk, but her nieces loudly opposed her, saying, That indeed it was too cold to attempt it. "I fear then," said she, "you must stay by your∣selves, as Mary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Caroline make a prac∣tice of walking every day; for there is nothing so unwholesome as sitting over the fire all the day long."—"I cannot see any necessity for walking out," said Sophia, "in such horrid cold weather, when the very idea of it is enough to freeze one."</P>

<P>HARRY HEADSTRONG had exceeding kind parents, who were willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o indulge him in
<PB N="15" REF="034505_0015_0FFE09C9CD216788"/>every thing that was proper; but he, like a foolish boy, would never take their advice. His papa one day bought a horse that was rather unruly, and strictly charged his groom never to let Harry ride it. Harry, however, soon found an opportunity for so doing; for one day when his papa was out, he went into the stables, and finding no groom there, he quickly saddled the horse, and was just preparing to mount, when his father returned. "What are you doing there, Sir?" said he.—"Only going to ride Crop, papa."—"Then," replied Mr. Head∣strong, "you are <HI>only</HI> going to do what I have expressly forbid; so pray put off your ride for the present; go into the house, and let me not see your face again to day." The next morning, at breakfast, Mr. Headstrong was so good as not to take any notice of what had happened the pre∣ceding day: but this indulgence, far from having the proper effect, only served to make Harry worse. His father and mother being obliged to go on a visit for some days, where they could not conveniently take him with
<PB N="16" REF="034505_0016_0FFE0988301839B0"/>them, Mr. Headstrong, before his departure, gave him some very good advice, and above all, desired him upon no account to get upon Crop's back. Harry assured him he would not, but no sooner was his father gone, than he went to Dick the groom, and contrived to send him out of the way upon some message or other. In the mean time, he mounted Crop, and the moment he was out of the sta∣ble yard, set off on a gallop. When he had got about a quarter of a mile from the house, he wished to turn back again, but he checked the bridle in vain—<HI>on</HI> Crop went, with such impetuosity, that Harry could no longer keep his seat.</P>
<P>Luckily, however, before he quite lost it, he had time to disengage his feet from the stir∣rups, otherwise he must have been dragged a considerable way; which circumstance would, most likely, have proved fatal to him, as the road was very uneven and flinty. His fall de∣prived him of his senses, and he lay some time on the ground before any one passed by. At last a countryman came that way, and placing
<PB N="17" REF="034505_0017_0FFE09CC95BB89A0"/>him upon some hay in his cart, carried him to his own cottage. As soon as his wife saw Harry, "Good lack a day!" quoth she, "if this is not 'squire Headstrong's own son and heir! goodness me! if he should die!—do, there's a good man," said she to her hus∣band, "take Ball, and ride to tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a sur∣geon, <HI>pathecary,</HI> or something." Tomkin thought Joan's advice was good, so getting on Ball, he trotted away to the next town. Dur∣ing his absence, Harry came to himself, but was so bruised, that he could not move. Mo∣ther Joan was a good sort of a woman enough, but was rather inquisitive, and not a little talkative. She make Harry relate the whole adventure, and interrupted him every mo∣ment with some remark or other. At last, when he had finished, she exclaimed, <Q>Good gemini! how could you be so venturesome! 'Tis well for you that you did not break your neck; nay, I don't know but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>'ve got some broken bones as it is. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will the 'squire say! he will be out of his wits almost.</Q> Harry suffered so much pain that he hardly knew what the
<PB N="18" REF="034505_0018_0FFE098C550604E0"/>good woman said, but lay crying and roar∣ing at a great rate. "Oh," says Joan, <Q>you must not be in such low spirits neither.</Q> She then ran out of the room, and quickly returned with a cup of elder wine made hot with spices. It was lucky for Harry that the surgeon arrived just time enough to prevent the dose, for had he taken it, it would have increased his fever much, which was already at an alarming height. Mr. Hopkin said, that none of his bones were broke, but gave it as his opinion, that he ought to be removed to his father's house. This was agreed to, and for three weeks he kept his bed, dangerously ill. When his father and mother heard of the misfortune, they hastened back; so that, instead of staying from home a fortnight, as they had originally intended, they were absent but one day.</P>
<P>Any one would suppose that this accident would have been sufficient to warn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rry from disobeying his parents again; indeed it made an impression upon him for some time, but this wore away by degrees, and he be∣come
<PB N="19" REF="034505_0019_0FFE09CF60157C58"/>as bad as ever. At last he grew so mischievous, that no gentlemen would suffer their sons to keep company with him, fear∣ing they should follow his bad example. His father kept pistols in his bed chamber, and they were generally lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded: Harry was or∣dered never to touch them, and that he might have no opportunity of doing it, he was for∣bid entering the room. One day, however, when Mr. and Mrs. Headstrong, were gone out to dinner, he stole in unperceived by the servants, and getting one of them down, he pulled the trigger and discharged it. Unhap∣pily the pistol had not been looked at for some time, and was in so bad a condition that it burst. The consequence was, that his hand was shattered in so terrible a manner that he was forced to have it cut off. The excrutiat∣ing pain he then underwent, made him re∣flect seriously on his disobedience. Oh! (thought he to himself) if I had but minded what my father said to me, I should never have suffered thus! In fine, this last accident
<PB N="20" REF="034505_0020_0FFE09905FF23CE8"/>had so good an effect upon him, that for the future he did every thing his parents desired him to do, and consequently became a very good boy.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in winter, were very bad be∣tween <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Davenport's house and Mr. Live∣ly's, these two gentlemen had settled, that Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> should not ride home till the next day. Mrs. Davenport when taking leave of her nei∣ces for the night, reminded them of the break∣fast hour, adding, that if it was a fine morn∣ing,
<PB N="23" REF="034505_0023_0FFE09D4F8D3CE48"/>she would take them out with her to pay some visits. Sophia and Amelia were half determined not to rise any earlier than they had hither to done; but recollecting, that by so doing, they might go without their break∣fast, they thought it better to obey, and ac∣cordingly were down by half past eight. Mrs. Davenport commended their punctuality, but as she had discernment enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discov∣er the true cause, it gave her pain to think, that nothing but the fear of punishment was sufficient to make them act p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ly. As breakfast was not ready, they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their aunt into Mr. Davenport's study <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they found Mary and Caroline translating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench, and Charles and George at their Latin. Har∣ry Lively was looking over a folio book of prints, in which amusement Sophia and Ame∣lia readily accompanied him. When they had been thus employed for some time, they went to breakfast; when that was over, Mrs. Davenport, her two daughters, and nieces, went into the carriage to pay some visits in the neighborhood.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="034505_0024_0FFE0994AED2E488"/>
This lady, being desirous of making the holidays of Sophia and Amelia pass as pleas∣antly as possible, invited some young people, intending to have a dance, and Harry Lively's father was prevailed upon to let him stay at Mr. Davenport's till it was over. The day was expected with great impatience, as So∣phia and Amelia were never at any ball but that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ir dancing master's, and the little Davenports had never been at any at all. At last the time came, and the children who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arrived. Mrs. Davenport was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with their company merely for the ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng, but wished them to <HI>dine</HI> there also.</P>
<P>The company consisted of five young ladies, and six young gentlemen; there names were.</P>

It to these we add Harry Lively, the Dav∣enport, and their cousins, we shall find just enough to make nine couple. They began dancing at six o'clock, and would willingly have continued their sport till midnight, if Mrs. Davenport had thought proper; but that lady judged ten a better hour for supper, as none of them were above fourteen years old. Though the ball had been purposely made for the entertainment of Sophia and her sister, they were so ungrateful as to pout, and give themselves airs, because they could not dance any longer. Mrs. Davenport, however, chose to be obeyed, and all but her neices went to bed in perfect good humour. The next day there arrived a packet of letters from France. Mr. Easy's letter to his eldest daughter was as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 12.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SOPHIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I have not heard to the contrary, I am willing to flatter myself that you, Amelia, and all at Thorn Park are well. As I have
<PB N="27" REF="034505_0027_0FFE09DAC54092F0"/>sent my direction to your uncle, you may write as often as you please (the of∣tener indeed, the better.) I hope, my dear girl, that both you and Amelia behave prop∣erly to my brother and sister. Independent of the duty you owe them as your uncle and aunt, you ought to esteem yourselves partic∣ularly obliged to them for their kindness in permitting you to be at their house during your vacation. You must be sensible how much more comfortable you are in that situa∣tion, than if you had spent the holidays at school. You, my dear children, have no mother alive: there must be many little things to correct in your dispositions, which I have no opportunity of attending to, and which your governess, having so many more young people under her care, is very likely to overlook. But yet, these circumstances form no ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> for any mishehaviour of your's, as you have an aunt who is highly ca∣pable of directing you, and loves you as if you were her own children. Consider this, my
<PB N="28" REF="034505_0028_0FFE099A602533C8"/>dear girls, and be particularly attentive to any advice she may give you, as you may depend upon it, 'tis for your good.</P>
<P>I shall be at Thorn Park about the begin∣ning of next month. I have written to my brother, to ask him to give you house room till then; as I should wish to spend a few days with you before you return to school. Adieu, my dear children, believe me to be</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate father, HENRY EASY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Though Sophia and Amelia were very glad to hear from their father, they were not al∣together pleased to find that he differed from them in thinking that they were to pay obe∣dience to Mrs. Davenport. They were so foolish as to imagine that she only reproved them for the sake of finding fault, and were inwardly determined to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more atten∣tion to her than they had hitherto done. They kept their resolution; and though Mrs. Dav∣enport was always proposing some party of
<PB N="29" REF="034505_0029_0FFE09DDD11A0188"/>pleasure for them, they took no pains to please her in return.</P>
<P>As to their getting up early in the morn∣ing, though their aunt was continually re∣presenting to them how unwholesome it is to spend so many hours in bed, they did not heed her, till Mrs. Davenport put her threat in execution of letting them go without their beakfast, if they were not down by nine o'clock. She was sorry to be obliged to have recourse to so harsh a method, but finding that a milder one had no effect upon them, thought it her duty to do all she could, to make them follow a custom so beneficial to their health. Twelfth Night now came on, and Mrs. Davenport, still indulgent, again invited the young people who were at the dance. Her own maid supplied the place of a pastry-cook, and instead of sugar figures, which generally constitute the prizes on this occasion, Mr. Davenport made up several parcels containing toys, &amp;c. with names pin∣ned upon them to answer to those which they
<PB N="30" REF="034505_0030_0FFE099E6A2AF7B8"/>were to draw. Thus, if one drew <HI>king,</HI> the parcel fell to his lot that was marked <HI>king.</HI></P>

<P>The young people were all much pleased with their presents, and spent the evening very happily in examining them and playing at different games till their separate carriages arrived. The next morning Mrs. Daven∣port took her nieces and daughters to the cot∣tages in the neighborhood, which she had al∣ways made a practice of doing, wishing to see herself how the poor people fared, and to relieve their poverty as much as lay in her power. They were rejoiced to see her, for they all loved and respected her greatly, as
<PB N="32" REF="034505_0032_0FFE099FF1BEAE20"/>she never quitted them without leaving marks of her bounty behind her. It was not for these visits alone that they were indebted to her, for she frequently <HI>sent</HI> them clothes, butcher's meat, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in winter they came every other day for soup, which Mrs. Davenport caused her servants to distribute in quantities according to the number of dif∣ferent families. Mary and Caroline, too, of∣ten begged of their mama to let them make some clothes for the younger children, which request Mrs. Davenport was ever ready to agree to; and such great pleasure did they find in this employment, that when they had done any thing worthy of a reward, Mrs. Davenport gave them m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erials for making a petticoat, gown, &amp;c. for some little peasant girl or other. Mary was this day provided with a gown for Madge, their late gardener's daughter, and Caroline with a petticoat; as they had observed, the last time they paid the little girl a visit, that she was in great want of both these articles. Now, as I think it ve∣ry likely that my young readers wish to know
<PB N="33" REF="034505_0033_0FFE09E3D98FF200"/>how Mary and Caroline had purchased this indulgence, I shall inform them, that they had been particularly attentive to their dif∣ferent exercises for a month past, and this at∣tention their kind mama never failed to re∣ward.</P>
<P>When they had all stepped into the car∣riage, the servant put in a bundle containing little Madge's gown and petticoat. "What's this," said Sophia; "what are you put∣ting this in for?"—"Oh," says Caroline, that bundle belongs to me and my sister; it must not be left behind upon any ac∣count"—<HI>"Indeed but it shall,"</HI> returned So∣phia, "if it is to be placed against my feet in this manner."—"Well then." said Caroline, I will take it up in my lap; pray don't quarrel about it." "Pray, miss Caroline," said Amelia (who sat upon the same side), "don't think I'll permit the nasty bundle to crowd <HI>me</HI> up; is not the coach full enough already, without <HI>bundles?</HI>" Mrs. Davenport cast an angry look at her nieces,
<PB N="34" REF="034505_0034_0FFE09A2D5070A98"/>and without saying any thing to them, order∣ed "the postillions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o drive on. Here then," said Amelia (holding the bundle to the out-rider as she spoke) <Q>here, do <HI>you</HI> take it back to the house, for I declare it shall not be on my side.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport, however, forbade the ser∣vant to take it, and turning to her niece, <Q>Here, Amelia, let <HI>me</HI> have it; it takes up but very little room, and even if it were <HI>twice</HI> as big, you ought not to complain; but I hope you will cease so to do, when you know what it contains.</Q> She then opened it, and displaying the contents, said, <Q>These clothes are for a poor little girl who wants them very much this cold weather, as her own are very old and thread-bare; would you then be so uncharitable as to suffer her to remain a week or two longer in this uncomfortable situation, because you cannot submit to the small inconve∣nience of being crowded for a little time? Or, supposing it were to be four hours be∣fore
<PB N="35" REF="034505_0035_0FFE09E6A300AD98"/>we reach her cottage, is it not much better that you should be a little incom∣moded for that time, than that she should be shivering for a <HI>week?</HI></Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very likely, indeed, when coals hereabouts are as <HI>cheap as dirt,</HI> and you cannot stir half a dozen steps without meet∣ing with a coal-pit. There is not a single cottage that has not a roaring fire in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you forget that she has something else to do besides sitting by the fire-side all the day. Young as she is, she goes to market to sell the poultry she rears herself, and to bring back provisions for the family—draws water—keeps the cottage and the little yard that belongs to it clean; and when she can be spared from home, earns nine-pence a day by working at the farmers' houses round about, as a chair-woman. Thus you see she has a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of business upon her hands, and of such a nature as of course exposes her very much to the severity of the weather, I cannot always spare my
<PB N="36" REF="034505_0036_0FFE09A6DDC23D88"/>servants from their work, so wish to take this opportunity of conveying some warm cloathing to the poor child, or otherwise (as I said before) <HI>she must be shivering for a week,</HI> if not <HI>longer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, ma'am, there is not much chance of <HI>that,</HI> as part of her family come three times a week for soup.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now pray tell me, So∣phia, did you think of that when you first objected to our carrying the bundle?</P>

<P>You have told one false∣hood, and to get out of the scrape, are only

She lives with her grand∣father and grandmother, who are both too infirm to walk six miles; and therefore, in∣stead of the soup, I give them more clothes and money than sails to the share of any oth∣er of the poor cottagers hereabout.</P>
</SP>
<P>Sophia knew she was in the wrong, and be∣ing sensible that it would be to no purpose to endeavour to defend herself, made her aunt no answer, but sat in sullen silence till the carriage stopped at the cottage in which Madge lived.</P>
<P>They entered a little room that serv∣ed both for parlor and kitchen, where they found her grandmother knitting, and at the same time attending to a saucepan full of broth that was on the fire. She rose with difficulty at their entrance, and upon being desired by Mrs. Davenport to keep her seat, cried out, <Q>God bless you, my dear lady! you have always been good to me, and I wish I was strong enough to work day and night to serve you.</Q></P>

<P>Ah! I am sure I ought never to forget that as long as I live, and—</P>

<P>Well, to be sure your lady∣ship is very good; but he won't expect such a great honour.</P>

<P>The old woman, with some reluctance, now shewed Mrs. Davenport and her party up a kind of ladder, which conducted them into a small apartment, the walls of which

<PB N="41" REF="034505_0041_0FFE09EDC02C28B0"/>were neatly white-washed, and the boards as clean as possible. In one corner was a bed in which lay old Joseph. Mrs. Davenport observing that he had his eyes shut, offered to go down again, lest she should disturb him; but was prevented by his waking from his slumber. The old woman approached and said, "Here is my lady Davenport come to "see you:—how do you now, my dear?" Joseph raised his head, and seeing the visitors, apologised for his not being able to receive them in a better manner; adding, that, (ill as he was) if he had known of their coming, he would have got up. "Then," said Mrs. Davenport, <Q>I am very glad you had no no∣tice of it, as my intention is to <HI>comfort</HI> all the cottagers I visit, and not to put them out of their way.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, madam, your charity is very well known: every body who <HI>knows</HI> you, <HI>loves</HI> you, and I can safely say, (and I have now lived eighty-six years) that I never

<P>You are perfectly right, my good lady: depend upon it, the only way to be happy, is to be virtuous; and surely charity is a great virtue. <HI>You,</HI> young ladies, perhaps will believe an old man, when he tells you, that, both among poor and rich, he never knew a wicked person happy.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my good man, do not talk of dying yet, I hope to see you alive

<P>God bless <HI>you,</HI> my lady, and all your worthy family—That is a long time to look forward. May you all live many, ma∣ny years! But as for me, my days are very nearly at an end.</P>
</SP>
<P>At this part of the conversation, she could not refrain from tears; but, amidst all her anx∣iety for the poor man, felt a gleam of joy up∣on seeing her two nieces equally affected with the scene. As for Caroline and Mary, they sobbed aloud. Joseph, perceiving their sor∣row, begged them to be comforted; <Q>For indeed, ma'am," said he, "you cannot think how happy and lightsome I feel; and if it was not for my poor wife's and grand child's sake, should die as easy as if I was going to sleep: but, when I see them miser∣able at the thoughts of my death, I cannot help pitying them. My dear Joan has al∣ways
<PB N="44" REF="034505_0044_0FFE09B205BB54B8"/>ways been a good and tender wife to me, and as for my little Madge, she is as dutiful and clever a little lass as you would wish to see: your ladyship's goodness to her has been great, and your promise to take her (when a few year's older) into your ser∣vice, has given my Joan and me many an happy hour. But your ladyship must let her stay with her poor grandmother (for she loves her dearly) till she follows me: how soon that may be, God alone knows! She is now, and has been for many months, very infirm. The wine good 'Squire Da∣venport sent us, has helped to cheer her much—till this last illness of mine, we used constantly to take a glass of it together ev∣ery night: and my dear little Madge, when she had finished all her work, would sit down by us and read a chapter or two in the Bible. And let me tell you, ma'am, she has a very good hand at it. When I was a little boy, your ladyship's grandfath∣er paid for my schooling, and would often
<PB N="45" REF="034505_0045_0FFE09F4A90BE770"/>take delight to hear me read; and as my learning cost the good gentleman so much, I thought it should not be thrown away, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> instructed my boy as well as I was able; and as he had not much time on his hands, I thought I might as well teach his little Madge▪ and if, poor man, he was alive now, what joy it would give his dear hon∣est heart to see her so well provided for; as such I already consider her, knowing that your ladyship's promises will never be broken.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport renewed her promises to the good old man; and was shewing the lit∣tle gown and petticoat to him, when Joan en∣tered the room with the broth she had been preparing for him. <Q>You are a good wo∣man, Joan," said he, "and I will (with my lady's leave) drink the broth; not that I am hungry, but because I know it will give you pleasure. You deserve to have your heart made glad every hour of your life, and my lady here s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ms to try to do it
<PB N="46" REF="034505_0046_0FFE09B38C470160"/>as often as she can. For look here, my dear, (shewing the clothes) here is a fresh instance of the worthy noble family's goodness to us.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Joan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless you, my lady, and you too, my charming young ladies, for I guess this is your work. Our little Madge is bound to pray for you every <HI>hour.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Mary and Caroline courtesying, modestly, replied, <Q>that they thought it a pleasure to do any thing for little Madge, they loved her so dearly.</Q> Ah! cried Joan, you will both be as good as your mama, my little dears. "They cannot be better!" said Joseph, as he emptied the bason of broth. "But," con∣tinued he, <Q>would not these young ladies choose some little refreshment? I have not the happiness of knowing, <HI>these</HI> two, but if I may judge by their likeness to <HI>you,</HI> madam, they are your relations.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are my brother's children.</P>

<PB N="47" REF="034505_0047_0FFE09F76F6F2C58"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, madam! your brother Henry? I beg pardon—I recollect you had no other. Ah! your brother Henry, he used to love me dearly—I remember he had a lit∣tle garden of his own—I marked it out for him—a pretty little fellow he was, with his little rosy cheeks and hazle eyes; I think I see him now running towards me, with his brown hair blowing about; "Here Joseph, Joseph," cried he, "my papa has been so kind, he has given me leave to have a piece of ground to <HI>myself,</HI> if <HI>you</HI> will give it me, in one of the kitchen gardens, or any where you please out of sight; for my papa says, he supposes I shall make fine work of it; and as you like to keep the pleasure-arounds so neat, he thought you would not wish me to have it thereabouts." Then away we both trotted as fast as we could, <HI>he</HI> pulling along. When we got to the place, I marked out the ground, and weeded it for him. "Now," says he, "you must, dear Joseph, give me some flower roots, for I should
<PB N="48" REF="034505_0048_0FFE09B657953370"/>like to have flowers as well as sallad; for mama likes flowers, and so does Mary (that was <HI>you,</HI> ma'am) and I shall give them a nosegay very often." Thus would he run on, dear little fellow! I wish I could see him now.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mrs. Davenport made the old man very happy, by informing him that she expected her brother every week: Joseph had not seen him for near four years; for when Mr. Easy was last at Thorne Park, he (the old man) was gone into Wales, to transact some business for his landlord, Mr. Davenport. So∣phia and Amelia listened with great atten∣tion to the above account of their father, and when their annt reminded them, that she had other cottages to visit, took their leave with some reluctance.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport, upon quitting the house, inquired of Joan, whether there was any thing they wanted; adding that till she had an opportunity of calling again, she should
<PB N="49" REF="034505_0049_0FFE09FA3790E638"/>send a servant every day to inquire after Joseph, and to bring them wine, or any assistance they were in need of. Joseph's wife returned her many thanks, said, they wanted nothing at present, and that if Mr. Easy would honor them with a visit, it would give great pleasure to her poor husband; but, as the sur∣prise might be too much for him in his pre∣sent weak state, begged of Mrs. Davenport to let them know an hour or two beforehand. That lady promised to attend to the cau∣tion, and leaving her love (with that of her neices and daughters) for little Madge, step∣ped into the carriage, and directed the pos∣tillions to drive home, and in their way to stop at the next cottage; which was inhabited by a poor laborer, his wife, and five children. The eldest was a boy, thirteen years old, who (with his father) earned his brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy mend∣ing the roads, and occasionlly acting as a brick∣layer, carpenter, &amp;c. to the neighboring fami∣lies. The mother and eldest girl sold their spinning, and in the summer worked in the

<PB N="51" REF="034505_0051_0FFE0A40F9630658"/>fields. These endeavors (though poor) pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ed them some trifling comforts, but much was still wanting. The Davenport family sought every opportunity of relieving those poor who were endeavouring to help themselves, and shewed a spirit of industry; and likewise those who were incapacitated from earning an honest livelihood by casualties, or extreme old age. When the carriage stopt, two little girls ran out of the house, and seeing Mrs. Davenport, who was just getting out, cried, <Q>Sister! sister! here is 'Squire Davenport's lady, and all the <HI>young</HI> ladies! and the coach! and the horses! and the servants! and all the fine things!</Q> Upon hearing this ex∣clamation, Molly, the second daughter, left her knitting, to meet Mrs. Davenport, who with her four companions, was now half way between the coach and cottage. Molly acquainted her, that both her mother and el∣dest sister were gone out, the one to market, and the other to sell her work; "but," con∣tinued she, "<HI>for all</HI> that, if your ladyship and
<PB N="52" REF="034505_0052_0FFDC67F1847A708"/>the young ladies will walk in, there is a ve∣ry good fire, and the room is quite tidy."— Ah! that it is," cried little Doll; "for I and my sister have just now been sweep∣ing it, and the fire is as bright as the sun; and all comfortable against mother and fa∣ther and sister Hetty come home." Mrs. Davenport smiled at the little girl's vivacity and taking her and the youngest by the hand, walked on; upon which the eldest cried out, "Pray, Dolly, do not go nigh the lady with those <HI>dirty</HI> hands, and that <HI>dirty apron.</HI>"— "Very true," said Dolly, "I quite forgot <HI>that,</HI> but I hope I have not done any harm <HI>yet,</HI> and I'll run directly to the pump and wash my hands, and take off my apron, and be back in a trice!" and away she ran. Mrs. Davenport and the rest sat round the fire, and the following dialogue passed between them.</P>

<HEAD>The Poor Man's Legacy.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was once a poor man who had two daughters: Jenny was the eldest, and Martha the youngest. Their father was taken ill and died. On his death bed, he called them both to him, and thus addressed them: <Q>My dear
<PB N="56" REF="034505_0056_0FFE0A02AC78E728"/>girls, you will soon be turned into the wide world, I have worked as much as I have been able, but all my endeavours to leave you a little money have been fruitless; and all I can do is to give you a little advice. You must both work hard for your living, as you must be sensible there is not a single person from whom you can expect any as∣sistance. That you Jenny will be industri∣ous, I have not the least doubt: I wish I could be as confident, Martha, with respect to you; but as you have always loved me tenderly, I have some hope that my death bed advice will not be thrown away. You will be both left to yourselves, without a soul to direct you; but still you may suc∣ceed, if you will be but good and indus∣trious. To be <HI>happy</HI> one must be <HI>good,</HI> in all stations of life. To those who live in affluence, it is a necessary qualification as well as to the cottager▪ In the former case, it directs the minds to a proper use of riches, it teaches the <HI>only</HI> way of enjoying
<PB N="57" REF="034505_0057_0FFE0A468E6418E8"/>them: without it, though rolling in riches, men are miserable. How indispensably necessary is it then to the poor; whilst un∣dergoing the sharp pains of hunger, they have need of consolation, and what can af∣ford them more than a good conscience!— never commit a bad action upon any con∣sideration whatever; though it were to procure you all the comforts and elegan∣cies of life, you would still be miserable. Not all the riches of the world can give in∣ward peace to a wicked person.</Q></P>

<P>Jenny and Martha received their father's advice with heartfelt gratitude. They prom∣ised to follow it, and, weeping bitterly, beg∣ged his blessing. He gave it them with great earnestness, and expired.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport commended Molly's read∣ing, and was making some remarks upon the story, when Dolly returned, with intelligence that "she spied her mother coming down the hill;" adding, "that, she had been hunting
<PB N="58" REF="034505_0058_0FFE0A0590CE2F60"/>all over the garden for some snow drops and crocuses for the young ladies, but could only find one of each; and I am very sorry for it," continued she, "for I do not know which to give them to. They have <HI>all</HI> been very civil to me, but this young lady (pointing to Mary) made me four nice bibs and aprons—so I think, miss, I <HI>must</HI> give them to you (that is, if you will take them) for I know you have very fine flow∣ers indeed at home—such as I seldom <HI>see,</HI> but you look so smiling and good natured, that I am sure—yes, I am quite sure, you will accept them."—Mary returned the pres∣ent with a kiss, and told the little girl, that if she had but drawn up the flowers by the roots, she would have taken them home and planted them.—"Oh, if that's all," replied Dolly, "I can soon get you some snow drop roots, though they are not in flower!"—and away she ran into the garden. The mother now entered the room, and testified her acknowl∣edgements for Mrs. Davenport's kind visit,
<PB N="59" REF="034505_0059_0FFE0A4999DB81C0"/>I fear, my good woman," replied that lady, <Q>I cannot stay much longer, as the day shuts in apace, and the roads are so bad, I am afraid of returning in the dark; but,</Q> ad∣ded she, <Q>you must tell me if you want any thing and I will endeavour to send, or bring it as soon as possible.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dawson.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am bound to pray for you, ma'am, and so is my whole family. I want nothing at present, for I and my daughter have had plenty of good work lately, which (with my husband's and son's wages) has brought us in a good deal. I have now nine shillings and sixpence by me, which will last some time; and I have a prospect of work for three weeks longer. I know your good∣ness so well, that you will never let a family perish for want of a little assistance: This madam is a great comfort to us all, but while we can work we will never come upon you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>I highly approve of your sentiments, and while you continue in the same way of thinking, you will continue to thrive;
<PB N="60" REF="034505_0060_0FFE0A0859C9DE20"/>nothing but ill health can prevent it; that, I hope none of your family will ever feel the ill effects of: but even then you must not de∣spair, as you will always find a friend in your landlord. By the bye, he desired me to tell your husband, that there were some repairs wanting in the stables; and that whenever he was at leisure, he wished him to come and look at them. Good bye, my dear girls, whatever leisure time you have, give up to your reading; give my love to your sister Hetty, and you, my good woman, remem∣ber me to your husband. Adieu!</P>
</SP>
<P>The little girls and their mother accom∣panied Mrs. Davenport and the young ladies to the carriage door, and courtesyed respect∣fully as they drove away. <Q>What a charm∣ing thing is industry!</Q> cried Mrs. Daven∣port, still looking at the cottage; <Q>those poor people maintain themselves entirely by it. They are far more happy than if they were fed by the bounty of any one. They go to bed every night with the pleas∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="034505_0061_0FFE0A4C671C3500"/>reflection that they have spent the day well. They are always cheerful, being conscious that they fulfil their duty.</Q></P>
<P>The conversation now turned upon old Jo∣seph: "I wish," said Mary, <Q>my uncle may come soon; not only because I long to see him, but that his arrival will make old Jo∣seph so happy.</Q>—"I know," returned Mrs. Davenport, <Q>that the interview will be equal∣ly pleasing to my brother; he had always a great respect for the old man, and regret∣ted much his being in Wales when he visited us last."—"How affectionately the poor man spoke about him," cried Sophia▪—that is because he always treated him well,</Q> said Mrs. Davenport; <Q>he never thought worse of him for his poverty, he was well assured of his honesty; and though so much his superior in life, paid him as much at∣tention as if he had been the first man in the kingdom, because he knew him to be a man of integrity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="034505_0062_0FFE0A0C61F13580"/>
As soon as they got home, Mary put her snow-drop roots into some water, not hav∣ing time to plant them immediately. Mr. Davenport had that morning received from his bookseller at York a great many new pub∣lications, some of which were designed for young people. After tea, when they were all assembled in the library, he went to a large packing case, and taking out a small volume, asked the children if they had a mind to hear a fairy tale; "A fairy tale!" they all ex∣claimed, "Oh, pray, Sir, let us hear it."—"With all my heart," said Mr. Davenport; "but then Charles must read it to you."—"Oh, that I will, with pleasure," cried he; and taking the book from his father, began reading.</P>

<HEAD>The Fairy Tale.</HEAD>
<P>THE king and queen of Rosyland had an only daughter, whose name was Melpomene. She was extremely beautiful, but of so bad a temper, that no stranger could sit an hour in
<PB N="63" REF="034505_0063_0FFE0A4DEE8A2388"/>her company, without thoroughly disliking her. She was passionate and proud, but had a good heart; and if her parents had correct∣ed her foibles when a child, she would have made an amiable princess. The fairy, Ben∣evolenta, who presided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her birth, had fore∣told, that if her father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mother kept her in the palace after she was two years old, it would prove a great source of uneasiness to both parties. She perceived that this predic∣tion gave them great pain, and in some meas∣ure to mitigate it, proposed her own habita∣tion as a proper asylum for Melpomene, till such time as her magical books should inform her that she might live with her father and mother. The queen acknowledged herself much obliged to Benevolenta for this offer, but inwardly determined not to profit by it, as she could not imagine where a daughter could be so well situated as under a father's roof. The king was of the same opinion with his royal consort; he had long wished for a child, and now when he had got one,
<PB N="64" REF="034505_0064_0FFE0A0DE8B259A8"/>was in no great hurry to part with it. When Melpomene was a month old, the queen was carried round the city in a car made of ivory and gold, drawn by white horses, harnessed with white and silver ribbon, and led by little boys, dressed in white, and garlands of roses. Four and twenty g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s (none older than twelve preceded the carriage, strewing flowers. The queen's household closed the procession.</P>
<P>When the festival was over, the fairy Ben∣evolenta took her leave of the king and queen, and taking Melpomene in her arms, kissed her tenderly, and turning to the queen, "Oh, Asteria!" said she, <Q>have compassion on this poor babe: sacrifice a little self-gratification to her happiness, and when the destined hour arrives, consign her to my care; and though maternal fondness must regret the separation, be not so weak as to give way to a wish, which, if gratified, will involve your child in misery.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="034505_0065_0FFE0A53432C9B58"/>
She then waved her wand, and immediate∣ly a car appeared in the heavens, drawn by four doves; it descended, and mounting it, she was presently out of sight.</P>
<P>Two years soon passed away: Benevolenta appeared in Rosyland, and conjured Asteria to confide the princess to her care. But the queen was inexorable; neither threats or en∣treaties could prevail upon her to part with her darling. The king was equally obstinate, and Benevolenta departed with infinite re∣gret. Her enxiety for the fate of the prin∣cess, and natural goodness of heart, prompt∣ed her to take a long and very dangerous journey, in order to consult a superior gen∣ius, respecting the possibility of softening the rigor of her destiny. From him she received the following answer:</P>
<P><Q>If Melpomene had quitted Rosyland at the age of TWO YEARS, her days would have been crowned with bliss. Her ill-judging parents, by their folly, have doom∣ed
<PB N="66" REF="034505_0066_0FFE0A10D116AA10"/>her to future misery. But as our be∣loved fairy, Benevolenta, has interested herself in the fate of the child, it is decreed that her misery will not be ENDLESS.</Q></P>
<P>The fairy was overjoyed upon hearing this decree; and immediately set out for Rosy∣land. Upon entering the palace, she observ∣ed all the attendants countenances filled with dismay. She eagerly inquired the cause, and was told by one of them, that the princess had that morning been stolen away by an in∣visible hand. She was making farther inqui∣ries respecting the truth of this intelligence, when she perceived Asteria approaching. She appeared half distracted, staring wildly about her, and calling upon the princess. Benevolenta hastily went to meet and em∣brace her, but the queen starting back, ex∣claimed, <Q>It is not <HI>she!</HI> Why did you tell me she was found! You all take pleasure in deceiving me, but I do not care—Benevo∣lenta will soon be here, and she will tell me news of her. <HI>She</HI> will not be so cruel.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="034505_0067_0FFE0A54CA056630"/>
"I am Benevolenta," returned the fairy (shocked at her situation,) <Q>I am Benevolen∣ta, come to give you comfort.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Queen.</HI> YOU Benevolenta!—No, no! do not think I will believe it. Do you imagine I do not know Benevolenta when I see her? Benevolenta is by far more kind than you.</P>
<P>The fairy finding it was impossible to ad∣minister consolation to the queen in her pre∣sent state of mind, consigned her to the care of her domestics strictly charging them not to lose sight of her for one moment. She herself repaired to the king's apartments, where she found him in all the agonies of sor∣row. "Oh! my friend," said he, <Q>in what a situation do you find me! To what pur∣pose was a child granted to my prayers, if I was to be bereft of it so soon?</Q></P>
<P>"Stop!" cried Benevolenta, <Q>when the superior Powers blessed thee with a daughter, they conditioned that she was to
<PB N="68" REF="034505_0068_0FFE0A13A096D1B8"/>quit thy roof at the age of two years, and not to return for a certain space of time. You have dared to counteract their designs: you have been told of the consequences that would ensue. This misfortune is but the beginning of the misery you have prepar∣ed for her. It is your own work; do not arraign the justice of the higher powers, be∣cause you have been presumptuous enough to draw down their anger by disobedience to their commands.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" replied the king <Q>do not add to my misery by these just reproaches. I have been greatly to blame; and I now, with sufficient weight, feel the punishment of my errors. But I have still a small ray of hope left:—From you I expect succour— intercede for me, and</Q>—</P>
<P>"It is already done," replied the fairy; <Q>I have obtained from the great ALMANZO-ROASTER a promise, that she will not <HI>always</HI> be unhappy, THAT HER MISERY WILL NOT BE ENDLESS.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="034505_0069_0FFE0A57AA2A3C38"/>
The king, upon hearing these last words, threw himself at the fairy's feet, and caught hold of her robe. "Benevolenta," said he; <Q>you have restored me to life; you have laid me under eternal obligations. Then you <HI>can</HI> give me hopes of my daughter; I shall again have her in my arms, again embrace her! what joy!—But while I thus anticipate my delights, what may she be enduring! How can I tell but what some evil genius has got her in his possession— cruel thought!—Oh, Benevolenta! release me from my torture—tell where she is.</Q></P>
<P>These interrogations troubled the fairy. She well knew his conjectures were very well founded; but, fearing to increase his anxie∣ty, totally discouraged them: adding, that she had not the least doubt but that the prin∣cess would soon be restored to him and his be∣loved consort; and, assuring him of her ut∣most assistance, vanished from his sight, and the instant she found herself in her own pa∣lace,
<PB N="70" REF="034505_0070_0FFE0A5BB1678D70"/>set about preparing a charm for the dis∣covery of Melpomene.—</P>

<P>The children were all listening with great attention, when a servant, who had been sent that morning to the next post town, returned with a packet of letters, and it afforded no little joy to the circle to find that among the rest there was a long one from France. The children crowded with eagerness round Mr. Davenport, whilst his amiable wife, hanging on the back of his chair, shared in the pleasure they all received upon being acquainted with the contents.</P>
<P><Q>My dear friends at Thorne Park will be very happy to hear, that, by the time they receive this, I shall be but a few miles from them. If the wind proves but favorable, it is most probable I shall have it in my power to embrace them on the fifteenth.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning as they were sitting at breakfast, they heard the sound of a car∣riage driving up the avenue: They all jump∣ed up from the table, and running to the window, with one voice exclaimed, "Here "he is! Here he is!" In an instant the par∣lour door flew open, and Mr. Easy entered. I should have much to say, were I to repeat all that was said on both sides upon this happy meeting; those who have affectionate fath∣ers, uncles, and brothers, can easily picture to themselves what passed.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="034505_0076_0FFE0A1C2091C0D8"/>
Mr. Easy was a valuable acquisition to this little society; to a good heart, he joined an excellent understanding, an improved mind, and elegant manners. He and Mr. Davenport were educated at the same school, travelled together, and their dispositions being alike, they formed a friendship, which increased with their years, and which was afterwards strongly cemented by the union of Mr. Easy's sister with Mr. Davenport.</P>
<P>Mr. Easy also married, but unfortunately lost his wife two months after the birth of his youngest daughter, who, being a very sick∣ly child, did not survive her mother many weeks.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were very fond of their father, and, indeed, it would have been sing∣ular if they had not, as he ever treated them with true paternal tenderness. 'Tis true, they enjoyed but little of his society, as they never saw him, but when he paid them occa∣sional visits at school; but then he always testified so much pleasure in being with them, and so affectionately attended to all their little
<PB N="77" REF="034505_0077_0FFE0A6700D0A610"/>requests, that he was as dear to them as if they had always lived together.</P>
<P>After the description I formerly gave of these two sisters, the above may seem extraor∣dinary, but then my readers must consider, that their dispositions were such as could not hear contradiction, and therefore, while Mr. Easy had no opportunity of thwarting their inclinations, they behaved properly towards him: but it will soon appear, that, from the moment he had occasion to exert his parental authority, they were no longer the same af∣fectionate children.</P>
<P>This little family had so many interesting subjects for conversation, that when the din∣ner bell rang, they were quite surprised to find it so late. The evening stole off impercepti∣bly, and they all went to bed in high good hu∣mour.</P>
<P>The next morning, early, Charles and George took a walk to old Joseph's cottage, in order to prepare him for a visit from their uncle in the course of the day. The good couple were delighted with this intelligence the old man in particular, who declared he
<PB N="78" REF="034505_0078_0FFE0A1EEF33B998"/>felt himself younger for it by four or five years. Before the boys had got half way home, they met Mr. Easy, who could not restrain his impatience to see his old friend; they join∣ed him, and were witnesses to a very affecting scene upon their arrival at the cottage, where they staid above an hour, and upon their re∣turn home, found breakfast almost over. Mr. Easy acknowledged himself much obliged to his brother and sister for their attention to∣wards his old friend, adding, that he knew no body more deserving of their charity.</P>
<P>"Pray, Sir," said Sophia, <Q>why are you so particularly fond of old Joseph? I know he is a very good man, but he was but a common servant.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>"A common servant, my dear Sophia! and is that any reason why I should not respect his virtues?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, but I think there is no occasion to go and sit whole hours with a gardener.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you are of that opin∣ion, I should by no mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wish my children to pass their time in the servant's hall, or to make confidential friends of them; but I can∣not
<PB N="79" REF="034505_0079_0FFE0A6888ADB1E8"/>not conceive I let myself down in the least, when I keep company with a poor old man, who served my father faithfully many years; I consider him as my relation, and his age and infirmities demand my utmost atten∣tion. But, my dear Sophia, where did you get these strange notions? I am sure your cousins think very differently; I wish you would learn from them, that when the lower sort of people fulfil their duty, it is incum∣bent upon their superiors to treat them at all times with affability, and in such a case as this with respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>With <HI>respect,</HI> papa!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sophia, with <HI>respect;</HI> I owe it to Joseph as being so much older, and consequently, more experienced than myself; and I don't know a man upon earth more hon∣est and faithful than he is. To be sure, he has neither birth or riches to boast of, but that does not in the least lessen his title to re∣spect in my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Easy being very desirous of going to see some improvements that had been lately made on his estate, which joined to Mr. Da∣venport's, and as he wished his brother and
<PB N="80" REF="034505_0080_0FFE0A21B5D89F48"/>sister to give him their opinion upon some others he had in meditation, the chaise was ordered, and being now at the door, they sat off, meaning to be back by dinner.</P>
<P>Mary, Caroline, Sophia, and Amelia now went to take a walk in the garden, where the following dialogue passed between them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia aside to her sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think papa has caught the infection of my aunt; you see he is beginning to be as cross as Old Nick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, I'm Sure I shall rejoice when we set off for London; I wish, with all my heart, we had staid in Q—S—; such stupid holidays did I never spend before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I suppose we shall go now in less than a fortnight. I long for some fun again—there is no having any here but at the expense of receiving a long lecture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I long to be at Miss Leroux again—Lord, how I'll plague her this time! then the poor dear will write to her ma—ma—and tell—her—what—a naughty girl—Miss—Amelia Easy is! <STAGE>[Affecting to sob.]</STAGE> hah! hah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, that you may depend upon — <HI>a great clumsy shouldered thing</HI>—I hate her —she's such a whiny-piny thing.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="81" REF="034505_0081_0FFE0A6B6D050A28"/>
Mary and Caroline perceiving their cou∣sins had no inclination to talk with them, took the first opportunity of turning down another walk.</P>
<P>"I wish," said Mary, "my cousins were a <Q>little better tempered; I thought we should have been very happy together, but they will hardly take any notice of us, and then whenever mama gives them any little piece of advice, they only sneer and look at each other as if they were determined not to profit by it.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure mama is very good to take that trouble with them; it is more than they deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mama sees they stand much in need of advice, and she is so good, that she cannot bear to neglect any opportunity of being of service to them; but I own I shall not be at all sorry when they leave us.</P>
</SP>
<P>"That we know very well," cried out So∣phia (bouncing from behind an evergreen hedge, which ran along the side of the walk, where Mary and Caroline were) <Q>and I promise you, we shall not cry when the time comes; for I think you are all such disagreeable people to live with, that I'm
<PB N="82" REF="034505_0082_0FFE0A24845F81C0"/>I don't care how soon we leave you; and then, when we are gone, you may have as much advice preached as you please, without fear of our <HI>sneering,</HI> ha! ha!</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sophia, I did not think you had been half so ill natured as I find you are; I'm sure my sister and I would like to be friends with you of all things, but that is quite impossible, whilst you continue to speak so disre∣spectfully of mama, who loves us all dearly, and who does you much honor when she con∣descends to tell you of any of your faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Honor,</HI> indeed! a great deal of hon∣or truly! that's as good a joke as papa made when he talked of paying respect to the old gardener.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, for shame, Amelia! when you are in a passion, you don't care what you say, or whom you abuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Ma'am, who told you I was in a passion; and if I were, what is it to you, you little saucy thing, what business have you to interfere?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>What <HI>sweet, amiable, wise children</HI> these are, sister! Law—why do you stay to talk with them? There <HI>my dears, go and play
<PB N="83" REF="034505_0083_0FFE0A6E35DD1000"/>with your dolls;</HI> flounce away! that's right. Sweet Mary! Sweet Caroline! <HI>angelic little dears!</HI> Adieu!</P>
</SP>
<P>The two little Davenports quitted the gar∣den, highly disgusted with the behaviour of their visitors; but being conscious that they had nothing to reproach themselves with, they soon forgot their anger. Mary had gath∣ered a crocus which she sat down quietly to copy in water colours, and Caroline took some ribbon out of her work bag, with which she began to make a watch chain for her brother George, who, together with Charles, had accompanied the chaise on horseback.</P>
<P>There were large wooden shutters on the outside of the windows belonging to the room where Mary and Caroline were sitting: So∣phia and Amelia perceiving these, agreed to close them all on a sudden, and by that means prevent their cousins from pursuing their amusements in that apartment. They put their scheme in execution, and Mary and Caroline were forced to retire to their own room above flairs. These childish ill-natured sisters then began to throw snow balls at the windows, nor would they desist, till they had
<PB N="84" REF="034505_0084_0FFE0A274D57EC90"/>cracked three or four panes of glass: this, however, put an end to their pelting, and they ran into the house with their dirty clogs on, up the best stairs, and bouncing against their cousins' door, demanded entrance. Receiv∣ing no answer, they called them every abusive name they could think of, and thumped and kicked as if they had been breaking through the door.</P>
<P>Mary now rang the bell, which communi∣cated with the housekeeper's room, where Mrs. Davenport's own maid generally sat. Mrs. Anne upon coming up, found the Miss Easys had brought chairs and tables out of their own bed chambers, and piled them up in such a manner, that if the little prisoners had unlocked the door (which opened in∣wardly) they would all have tumbled upon them and probably have hurt them much. She attempted to take them down, which irritat∣ed Amelia to so great a degree, that she flew at her, and began pinching and thumping her in a threatening tone, commanding her to desist.</P>
<P>Anne was a good tempered young woman, but had no notion of receiving a blow from any one, especially when she was conscious
<PB N="85" REF="034505_0085_0FFE0A7106B51E08"/>she had given no just provocation. She there∣fore made not the least scruple of returning it. Upon which Sophia, who had all along been encouraging her sister, ran now to her assist∣ance. The poor maid seeing that she was like∣ly to come off the worst, disengaged herself from her antagonists, and made all the haste she could down stairs. Sophia and Amelia were pursuing her, when they heard Mrs. Davenport's voice in the hall, who was that moment come home. They turned short, went up stairs (three steps at a time) into their own room, and locked themselves in.</P>
<P>Anne immediately informed her lady of what had happened, making an apology for the lib∣erty she had taken in striking Miss Amelia, but that she really had done it in her own de∣fence. Mrs. Davenport replied, <Q>it was a pity she had been forced to go such lengths, but she could not blame her for what she had done.</Q> She then desired her to remove the chairs, &amp;c. and send Mary and Caroline down to her in the library. The little girls obeyed, and were ordered to relate the circumstances of the affray, which they did immediately, but without either justifying their own conduct, or
<PB N="86" REF="034505_0086_0FFE0A28D55C9508"/>condemning that of their cousins. Their ma∣ma had never had any reason to doubt their veracity; she approved very much of their behaviour, and undertook herself to settle the quarrel.</P>
<P>When dinner was served, Mrs. Davenport sent Mary to tell them, that both dinner bells had rang; but they told her (through the door) that they were not hungry, and did not choose to come down. Mary whispered this to her mama, upon which Mrs. Daven∣port repeated it to her husband and brother, who were very desirous to know what had been the matter which she promised to in∣form them of, when the servants had with∣drawn.</P>
<P>According to her promise, as soon as the de∣sert was upon the table, she related the whole affair, and concluded with saying, that she should take no notice of them, and that she supposed when they were tired of being alone they would come down. "Upon my word," said Mr. Easy, <Q>they give themselves great airs; but I'm quite of your opinion, the
<PB N="87" REF="034505_0087_0FFE0A73D114F490"/>less notice we take of them the better; they mortify <HI>themselves,</HI> not <HI>us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"Certainly," said his brother, <Q>if we send up to them, it will directly confirm them in the opinion they entertain of their own con∣sequence.</Q></P>
<P>It was therefore settled, that nobody was to go to them, not even a maid to help them to undress, or to take them any refreshment.</P>
<P>Tea came up, but still the Miss Easys did not make their appearance.</P>
<P>The following morning, when Ann went up to Mary and Caroline, they inquired if she had seen Sophia and Amelia?</P>
<P>"Oh, yes," Ma'am, said she, <Q>they were down before it was light, teasing the scul∣lion (the only servant up) for something to eat; but Bridget, who is not over civil, told them they must wait with patience till Mrs. Davies was <HI>stirring,</HI> as she had shut up the larder over night: then they went up a∣gain, and began making a monstrous noise. At seven Mrs. Davies gave them some bread and butter, but they abused her, because there was no water boiling to make them tea, though she told the dairy maid to give them
<PB N="88" REF="034505_0088_0FFE0A2E289ED590"/>some milk, warm from the cow; they are now sitting in the breakfast parlour, be∣fore the fire, with their feet on the sender, talking against every body in the house.</Q></P>
<P>I must not here omit a good natured action performed by Mary and Caroline.</P>
<P>When they quitted their room, they saw their cousins' door open, upon which they went in, and found the carpet rolled up in a heap, the bed curtains twisted round the posts, the pictures turned with their faces to the wall, and the whole apartment in confusion.</P>
<P>They knew this would make their mama very angry, and though they had so much reason to be offended with their cousins, they immediately began putting every thing in order, to prevent them from getting into far∣ther trouble. This took a great deal of time to accomplish, and though they made as much haste as possible, the clock struck nine before they had quite finished—they were therefore forced to neglect their morning's ex∣ercise, which Mrs. Davenport generally look∣ed over, immediately after breakfast. They were now in a great dilemma; they wished much to screen Sophia and Amelia from their
<PB REF="034505_0089_0FFE0A769B6C2C10"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="90" REF="034505_0090_0FFE0A2FAF1617A8"/>mama's anger; but it could not now be done, but at the expense of their own veraci∣ty, as Mrs. Davenport would not fail to ask how they had been employing themselves.</P>
<P>They had never deceived their mama in the most trivial affair, and therefore resolved to declare the whole truth, and rely upon her indulgence in pardoning the offenders.</P>
<P>They accordingly met her upon the stairs, and begged her, as an indulgence to <HI>them∣selves,</HI> not to say any thing about what had passed to their cousins.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport embraced them, and com∣mending them for their good nature, promis∣ed to attend to their request, and all three en∣tered the breakfast room together.</P>
<P>"Here they come," said the eldest, as they opened the door, "now for a sermon!"</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Davenport distinctly heard this impertinent speech, she did not chuse to notice it, but sat down to the table, and with∣out speaking a word to her nieces, ordered Caroline to wring for the tea kettle. So∣phia did not offer to move, though she sat close to the bell; Caroline endeavoured to reach it over her cousin's chair, but finding that
<PB N="91" REF="034505_0091_0FFE0A7969EF1F68"/>impracticable, she whispered, <Q>Pray Sophia, move a little;</Q> upon which Sophia with∣out rising, took hold of her chair with both her hands, and bounced herself away with such violence, that she overthrew a screen that stood behind her. Amelia burst into a loud laugh, but still her aunt took no notice. The hot water was brought in, and Mrs. Dav∣enport made tea. She gave a cup to each of the girls, but Sophia and Amelia refused it, saying, "they chose coffee."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coffee will not come up till your father and uncle come in from their walk.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia, Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I <HI>chuse</HI> to have tea.</P>

<P>Some sugar, cousins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I <HI>chuse</HI> honey.</P>
</SP>
<P>In short, they refused in the most diso∣bliging manner every thing that was offered to them, and were growing still more im∣pertinent, when their father entered, accom∣panied by Mr. Davenport and his sons.</P>
<P>They took their places, and, as they had agreed among themselves, spoke to every bo∣dy but Sophia and Amelia.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="034505_0092_0FFE0A3279EB7808"/>
As soon as breakfast was over, Mr. Easy, addressing himself to his two daughters, told them, <Q>he was going to write to Mrs. **** their governess, and acquaint her that they would be in Q—e S—e the following Monday.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better, I'm sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very <HI>fortunate</HI> you should both be of that opinion, and if you are so <HI>ex∣ceedingly fond</HI> of school, without doubt you will be glad to hear, I mean to give strict charge to Mrs. **** upon no account to per∣mit you ever to dine or drink tea with any of my friends, who used formerly to notice you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as you please, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy to Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, my dear little girl, will you ask your maid to see that your cousin's clothes are packed up by to∣morrow night, as they will set off at eight the following morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We sha'nt be dressed by eight, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall order the horses at that hour, and I desire you will be ready time
<PB N="93" REF="034505_0093_0FFE0A7C345D4600"/>enough to take a proper leave of your uncle and aunt, to whom you have many obligations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we to go by ourselves, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I shall go with you as far as —, where one of Mrs. D's assistants will meet, and conduct you to town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(whispering her sister.)</STAGE>
<P>And a charming journey we shall have!</P>
</SP>
<P>"Come," said Mr. Easy, <Q>you had better both leave the room; I see you are deter∣mined to behave ill, and whilst you con∣tinue in this perverse humour, the less we have of your company the better.</Q></P>
<P>His daughters took the hint, and flapping the door after them, went grumbling and muttering into the next room.</P>
<P>"I do not know what to do with those girls," continued Mr. Easy, <Q>their ingrati∣tude shocks me. I had no idea their dispo∣sitions were so untractable, or I should never have thought of troubling you with them so many weeks.</Q></P>
<P>"I am sure," replied Mr. Davenport, <Q>we have not considered it as any trouble, but they certainly are not pleasant girls to have in the house.</Q></P>
<SP>
<PB N="94" REF="034505_0094_0FFE0A342937C9D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would advise me what method to pursue. I sometimes think of taking a house in town, and providing a good governess, for I am convinced that school is not the place for them: It is impos∣sible Mrs. — can attend to all; a hundred little things must pass unnoticed; on the con∣trary, a governess at home has nothing to do but to attend to them alone, and if she is a sensible woman, she will know how to cor∣rect their faults, and at the same time en∣gage their affections.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Davenport approved this plan, but thought it a dangerous one to carry into exe∣cution, as so much depended upon their choice of the person. They talked a long while up∣on this subject: at length, in consequence of a proposal made by Mr. Davenport, it was settled in the following manner: viz. as Mr. Davenport meant in future to spend the first part of every year in town, for the sake of having proper masters for his children, there could be no reason why Sophia and Amelia should not then leave school, and live entire∣ly with them: by these means they would have proper attention paid to their educa∣tion,
<PB N="95" REF="034505_0095_0FFE0A7F05DC2EE0"/>without running any hazard whatsoever.</P>
<P>This scheme was highly pleasing to Mr. Easy, it rid him at once of all his anxiety, and he felt himself infinitely obliged to his bro∣ther and sister for this great proof of the sin∣cerity of their friendship.</P>
<P>At dinner Sophia and Amelia said little. Mr. Davenport generally asked the former to drink a glass of wine with him, he omitted the compliment that day, but Sophia helped herself out of the decanter that stood between her and her sister, who immediately followed her example.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Davenport rose from table, George followed her out of the room, and asked leave to have the conclusion of the fai∣ry tale read out before his cousins went away: his mama told him he might read it to them and his sisters that afternoon: he thanked her for this indulgence, and ran im∣mediately to fetch the book. Having called his brother, and found out the place where they had left off, he began as follows:</P>
<P>She, (that is, Benevolenta,) soon found out that Melpomene was in the palace of Horridona, a fairy, who made a common
<PB REF="034505_0096_0FFE0A39903E7280"/>practice of stealing away children with the cruel design of returning them to their pa∣rents with perverted minds and unhappy tempers. With this view she indulged them in every wish, whether innocent or wicked: she threw all sorts of temptations in their way, and at the same time, by her example and advice, eradicated every good principle that might serve to resist them.</P>
<P>Benevolenta was shocked to find this poor little princess in so terrible a situation, and was resolved to use all possible means to re∣lieve her. She immediately summoned the powerful genii Boccadindo, and intreated him to assist her. Boccadindo brought with him the little Fidelio: this amiable little creature had been brought up with the ten∣derest care and attention by a fairy aunt. To a beautiful figure was added the most en∣gaging disposition, and the most benevolent heart. Hearing from the fairy the situation of the princess, he begged her to permit him to exert himself for her relief "Alas! my child," said Benevolenta, "her mind, I fear, is already perverted."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="034505_0097_0FFE0A81CF3F36A8"/>
"Let us hope not," said Boccadindo; <Q>she must not be lost; and if the power of example can be of any service to her, she cannot have a better pattern of goodness than Fidelio.</Q></P>
<P>Fidelio returned the genii thanks for the good opinion he entertained of him, and kissing the fairy's hand, conjured her to em∣ploy him in the undertaking.</P>
<P>Benevolenta expressed the fears she enter∣tained for his own safety, and promised to yield to his intreaties, provided the genii would give him a talisman sufficiently pow∣erful to repel any rude attacks, the evil coun∣sels of Horridona might make upon the in∣tegrity of his heart.</P>
<P>"Never fear, Madam," replied Boccadin∣do, <Q>he has no need of talismans to preserve him free from guilt; such precautions are needless, his own heart, and the edu∣cation he has received, are talismans of much greater power than any he can be furnished with.</Q></P>
<P>The fairy now no longer hesitated, she gave her consent to the undertaking, and the
<PB N="98" REF="034505_0098_0FFE0A3E16892E28"/>genii presented Fidelio with a slipper, which, upon putting on his foot, would immediate∣ly procure what money, clothes, &amp;c. he might want for his journey.</P>
<P>Fidelio was now transported with joy: it had been foretold he would one time or other have it in his power to redeem a prin∣cess from captivity, and by the force of his example to reclaim her from the paths of vice. His generous heart exulted at the idea that the time for the accomplishment of the prophecy was come, and the eagerness he testified, proceeded purely from the desire of doing good, and not from any selfish views with regard to his own interest.</P>
<P>Boccadindo now took his leave; Fidelio put on the enchanted slipper, and imme∣diately the ground opened beneath him, and a little white horse appeared, ready bridled and sadled. The young prince mounted him, and was presently out of sight.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king and queen of Rosyland had issued a proclamation, prom∣ising honours and riches to that person who should bring the princess safe to their arms. Many were induced to undertake this cause,
<PB REF="034505_0099_0FFE0A3B17CBB490"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="100" REF="034505_0100_0FFE0A8497E02AD8"/>by the flattering prospects before them, but they all returned without any success, not having patience enough to follow the adven∣ture, as they were wholly unacquainted with the abode of Horridona.</P>
<P>Fidelio was equally ignorant of the situa∣tion of her palace, but by his unceasing ex∣ertions, and unrelenting fortitude, succeeded at last in the discovery. He travelled nine∣teen days through unfrequented deserts and dreary woods; on the 20th, just before sun∣set, he found himself in a large plain, at the farther end of which he perceived the palace of Delights, as it was erroneously stiled by the owner. The walls were ebony, the porti∣cos of solid gold, the window frames and roof of the same metal. The western sun shone full upon it, and made it, when con∣trasted with the dark gloom of some lofty pines that grew on each side, a most beauti∣ful object. Fidelio was delighted to behold the end of his journey, and immediately gal∣loped towards it. Upon his arrival at the grand entrance, he dismounted, and taking the slipper from one of his saddle bags, care∣fully deposited it in his bosom, and telling
<PB N="101" REF="034505_0101_0FFE0AC573F139D8"/>his little horse he had no present use for him, it immediately disappeared. He ascended a flight of ebony steps, with gold ballustrades, and entered a lofty hall, surrounded with a colonnade of ebony pillars, the bases and chapiters ornamented with gold, and wreaths of gold flowers twisted round the columns. The dome wore the appearance of the starry firmament on a frosty night. Opposite the great door was an arch, which served as an entrance to the bottom of a grand staircase of solid gold, which led up to a long gallery of white marble, whose walls were inlaid and the floor of different coloured marble; this opened into a suite of apartments, whose elegance was equal to their magnificence. He had already passed through twenty-nine rooms, every one varying from the other; he at length came into an octagon one of pea green marble, hung all round with large festoons of white and red roses, whose frag∣rancy perfumed the apartment—a small fountain of scented water rose in the middle.
<PB N="102" REF="034505_0102_0FFE0A8763366398"/>There were six niches, in which were placed alabaster statues of exquisite workmanship. On the opposite side of the room to that by which he had entered, was a green silk cur∣tain; upon drawing this aside, he found himself in a portico of white marble, which commanded a view of the park and gardens belonging to this beautiful palace. On the north the prospect was bounded by moun∣tains, whose tops were covered with snow; these however, were at so great a distance, and the intervening country so beautiful, that, far from affording a dreary aspect, they added new charms to the scene. The palace stood upon a lawn of the finest verdure, wa∣tered by a wide river that meandered through the adjacent country, and at length emptied itself into the sea, which terminated the view on the south. The flower garden, which was of great extent, was bounded by a colonnade of white marble; this was hollow and trans∣parent, so that at night, lamps were lighted in the inside, and altogether it had a very pleasing effect. A delightful concert was heard on the water, on which a number of boats were sailing. A magnificent bridge
<PB N="103" REF="034505_0103_0FFE0AC8432B7A48"/>was thrown over it, and the whole prospect together was so enchanting, that Fidelio for a moment forgot the princess, and stood wrapt in astonishment. Whilst he was gaz∣ing round with admiring eyes, he observed a party of young men and women below, who were making signs to him to come down: he immediately recollected himself, and hastened to join them. They paid him a thousand compliments, and offered their services in shewing him the beauties of the place. He thanked them for their polite∣ness, and told them he only wished to be in∣troduced to the fairy. "You may have that pleasure," they replied, "in a few min∣utes. She presides at our table, and we are in momentary expectation of a sum∣mons to attend her. You will be per∣fectly charmed with her; the beauties of her person are only rivalled by the brill∣iancy of her wit; and when once you have passed a few minutes with her, you will never have resolution enough to quit her palace."</P>
<P>While they were yet speaking, a band of martial music struck up, immediately num∣bers
<PB N="104" REF="034505_0104_0FFE0A8A33789AF0"/>of people issued from all parts of the garden; those who were on the water land∣ed in great haste, and the whole multitude eagerly crowded towards a large building that had, till then, escaped Fidelio's observa∣tion. Those with whom he had been con∣versing joined the rest, and by the force of others pushing forward, he at last entered an immense banquetting house, lighted up with a profusion of lamps; it was, however, kept very cool, the windows being all open and shaded with green silk curtains. In the mid∣dle was a table that could be enlarged or con∣tracted at pleasure, so that of whatever num∣ber the company consisted, it always appear∣ed full. The entertainment was magnificent; the most exquisite viands were served in great abundance in massy gold. The com∣pany being all assembled, a large folding door was thrown open, and twenty beautiful young girls entered the hall, dancing to the sound of the music above mentioned; they each of them held a large wreath of flowers, with which they formed a sort of triumphal arch for the fairy to pass through. Soft music was now heard, and Horridona entered, her
<PB N="105" REF="034505_0105_0FFE0ACB0EA8CEC0"/>train born by a page, whose dress entirely consisted of precious stones.</P>
<P>Fidelio was now presented to the fairy, who asked him in an affable tone of voice, "What had led him to her palace?" Total∣ly unused to deceit, he found it difficult to conceal the true motive of his journey; but knowing how fatal such an avowal must prove to the success of his cause, he replied with hesitation, that it was "curiosity." Horridona expecting him to have launched out in praise of the edifice and its owner, was not a little disappointed at his answer. She smiled at his confusion, and turning to his companions, "You must inspire this young man," said she "with a little more courage; our magnificence confounds him; he will like us better when he knows more of us; in the mean time you must give him confi∣dence; he is by far too bashful." To say the truth, Fidelio hung down his head, and look∣ed to great disadvantage, but he had sufficient cause to be disconcerted. The fairy appeared to him the most hideous figure he had ever be∣held: independent of the frightfulness of her per∣son, it required but a small degree of physiogno∣my
<PB N="106" REF="034505_0106_0FFE0A8D015ED098"/>to discover in her face that her mind was equally horrible. But now she gave the sig∣nal for the commencement of festivity. Fi∣delio suffered himself to be led to the table; but although the greatest dainties were offer∣ed him by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompanions, he could not be prevailed upon to caste a single morsel. His fright had taken away his appetite; he still continued to hang his head, now and then stealing a look at those who sat next him, many of whom he shortly perceived were en∣tertaining themselves with ridiculing his con∣fused air. Melpomene instantly rushed into his mind; he quickly recovered himself, and casting a look of eager inquiry all around him, endeavoured, but in vain, to see the princess. His prudence now suggested to him, that the only way to get intelligence of her, was to recom∣mend himself to the person in whose power she was, by conforming in some degree to the manners of her court.</P>
<P>Clovis and Lydia, who sat on each side of him, congratulated him on the return of his spirits. Young and giddy they had no idea of pleasure existing any where but in Horridona's palace. It is true, when first
<PB N="107" REF="034505_0107_0FFE0ACDD7394830"/>they were introduced to her, they were, like Fidelio, startled at her figure; but as they were then but children, and their principles unfixed, they were soon reconciled to her ap∣pearance, and being deceived by the false glare of happiness that shone in the feasts and balls with which she daily entertained them, this horror gradually wore off, and they now considered her in the same light as they had described her to Fidelio.</P>
<P>This young prince, no longer embarrassed, gave attention to all that was passing. The conversation (interrupted by loud bursts of laughter) was such as I am pursuaded would afford no amusement to my readers, were it to be repeated. Fidelio could join but little in it: he was even sometimes almost tempted to stop his ears.</P>
<P>The meats being removed, a magnificent desert, with the most curious wines, was plac∣ed on the table. In the middle was a tem∣ple made of little diamond men and women, carrying baskets of sweetmeats; they march∣ed up to the top of the table, knelt to the queen, and then dividing into two parties,
<PB N="108" REF="034505_0108_0FFE0A8FEB59B7A0"/>presented each of the company with a basket; meeting at the bottom, they joined hands, and danced back to the temple to the sound of a harp, which was played by a diamond boy sitting on the dome of the temple. None of the figures in this curious piece of mechan∣ism were more than seven inches high. It was near midnight when they quitted the banquetting-room: intoxicated with the li∣quors they had been drinking, they reeled after the queen into a large myrtle bower, where they were each presented with a goblet filled from a fountain whose water had the proper∣ty of recovering those who drank it from the effects of intemperance. Here the party sepa∣rated; some returned to the palace, and spent the remainder of the night in gaming, others again sat down to drink; dances were made in different parts of the gardens, but they were conducted without the least deco∣rum, and all was riot and confusion. In the mean time Fidelio, who had left the table at an early hour, had made a discovery that gave him no little joy. Fatigued with the noise and nonsense that prevailed among the com∣pany in the hall, he stole away unperceived,
<PB N="109" REF="034505_0109_0FFE0AD09FC842D0"/>and going into the park which was already il∣luminated, rambled about for some time: at last he crossed the river, and directed his course towards the wood that fronted the pal∣ace. Here he was preparing to rest himself from the fatigues he had lately undergone, when the voices of some children caught his ear; he immediately hastened towards the place from whence they seemed to proceed. He perceived a small palace of white marble: the portico was lighted up, and the doors being open he entered a hall, where a number of beautiful children were running and jumping about.</P>
<P>Upon seeing Fidelio, they immediately sur∣rounded him, and began pulling off the dia∣mond fringe with which his mantle was trim∣med, others ran away with his sword-knot and shoe-roses; but as there was not finery enough for them all, what little there was, quickly be∣came an object of contention. Words were soon succeeded by blows, and all the measures Fidelie took to pacify them were of no effect. Amidst the confusion of voices, he frequently heard the name of Melpomene pronounced: he soon discovered her to be one of the fore∣most in the battle. Her little face was distort∣ed with fury, the stowers which had ornament∣ed
<PB N="110" REF="034505_0110_0FFE0A92B3560378"/>her dress, were torn to pieces; roaring and stamping with vehemence, she pleaded her birth as a distinction that entitled her to the jewels.</P>
<P>The uproar still increasing, at last brought some of their nurses, who, upon seeing the manner in which they were engaged, ran back and immediately returned with a quantity of toys and sweetmeats to quiet them. Our young prince now stept forward, and apologised for the trouble he had occasioned. They replied, <Q>it was a pity he had come at all, the children were all of the sweetest dispositions in the world, and he was highly blameable in not providing himself with jewels enough for them all.</Q> It was in vain that Fidelio urged as an excuse, his accidentally coming near the place; they would not listen to him, and it was not without a great deal of grumbling, and upon con∣dition that he brought something for the chil∣dren, that they gave him permission to call again.</P>
<P>"Fortunate Fidelio!" said the young fairy to himself as he retired from the wood, <Q>you have found the object of your search.</Q> But this joy was of short continuance; for when he reflected on the situation of the unfortunate Melpomene, the prospect of her deliverance appeared to him at a greater distance than ever. "Alas!" exclaimed the almost desperate Fid∣elio,
<PB N="111" REF="034505_0111_0FFE0AD38BDCAEA0"/><Q>of what presumption have I not been guilty, in offering my service to the queen of Rosyland, towards the recovery of her daugh∣ter! Were she instantly removed to the palace of ALMANZOROASTER, and placed under the guidance and protection of the best and the most powerful of the genii, even there it would require the labour of years to eradicate from her bosom those seeds of vice which Horridona has plentifully sown, and diligently cultivated. And shall I, who am myself a child, pretend to combat and to overcome obstacles which would impede the progress of Almanzoroaster, and that too in the habitation of Horridona, in the midst of dangerous instructions, and equally danger∣ous examples? Can my weak eloquence per∣suade her to virtue, when every other hand presents a new allurement to pleasure, and every other tongue a fresh incitement to vice? Detained by the united powers of sin, folly, and Horridona, what presumption must it be in a child to pretend to break her chains? No, the freedom of Melpomene must be effected by a stronger arm than that of the inexperienced Fidelio. And yet,</Q> af∣ter a moments recollection within himself, <Q>with what face can I meet the fairy Benevo∣lenta,
<PB N="112" REF="034505_0112_0FFE0A9580CFBBB0"/>and tell her that I had entered the Pal∣ace of Pleasure, but had returned without Melpomene? That I had discovered the prin∣cess, but had not the courage, the generosity to attempt her deliverance? How can I tell her that I am a coward, unworthy of her confidence, and the good opinion of the genii Boceadindo! It must not be; the prophecy <HI>shall</HI> be fulfilled. I swear by the enchanted wand of the mighty Almanzoroaster, that I will not relinquish the palace of Horridona till the deliverance is effected by nature or Fidelio.</Q></P>
<P>George was here interrupted by the arrival of some company to tea, which unluckily prevent∣ed the conclusion of the fairy tale from being read that evening. I say unluckily, as the book then disappeared, and though searched for the next day in every corner of the house, was no where to be found. Many were the conject∣ures formed upon this occasion by the little Dave ports: their mama could easily have set them right, as she was privy to the affair.</P>
<P>She had seen Sophia steal behind George's chair, and (as she thought unobserved) snatch up the book and put it in her pocket. When inquiries after it were made the next day by the children, this good lady was surprised to
<PB N="113" REF="034505_0113_0FFE0AD794B9F438"/>see with what <HI>sang-froid</HI> Sophia persisted in de∣nying any knowledge of the transaction. Shocked to the last degree, she forbad any thing farther being said on the subject, and di∣verted their attention by the introduction of another book, equally entertaining and more instructive. Mrs. Davenport was unwilling to pain her brother by the knowledge of his daughter's behaviour, and therefore declined taking any notice of it at that time; but no sooner did she retire to her own dressing room, than she wrote a letter to her governess, in which she intreated her in the strongest terms to watch over her pupil during the time she was to remain in Q—S—e, and to do her utmost to eradicate the hateful vice she had contracted.</P>
<P>This letter produced much mortification to Sophia, after her return to school; for Mrs. S. affisted by the hint she had received, convicted her in many untruths, for all of which she was punished with the greatest severity.</P>
<P>The following day, as the young people were sitting together after breakfast, Harry Lively came in, and informed the Miss Easys, that he was going to ride with his papa to the next town, and that knowing they were to set off the next morning for school, he came to
<PB N="114" REF="034505_0114_0FFE0A984A7E9D70"/>inquire if he could execute any commissions for them. "O yes," said Sophia, "I want a hundred things, but I suppose there is no get∣ting them in this nasty Yorkshire."—"Why not, cousins?" said Charles; "I wish you had told me what you wanted, and I think I could have contrived to have got them some way or other. You may get any thing at York."—"Yes, indeed fifty miles off; you are none of you so kind as to send so far for any body but yourselves."—"Yes," said Charles, <Q>they could have come very well with papa's books the other day; but I dare say, if you will write down what you want, Har∣ry will get them for you if they are to be had in the town of—.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia now taking out her pencil, with the assistance of Amelia, wrote a long lift of articles, which they desired Harry Lively not to show to any body, nor would they permit him to read it out.—"But," said the poor boy (whilst they were cramming the paper into his waist∣coat pocket,) "I don't know at what shops these things are sold."—"Poh," cried Sophia, <Q>can't you remember when I tell you, the three first are to be had at the haberdashers, the two next at the grocers, the two that come afterwards at the toy shop, the three next at the stationers, and the five last at the

<PB N="116" REF="034505_0116_0FFE0A9B19DCC9E0"/>pastrycooks. There, that's all, now go, my dear; make haste, I dare say your papa is waiting; but do you hear, you need not go sending all these things here to-night—that will be quite foolish of you—I should not wish to have them before to-morrow; so you need not put yourself out of the way by call∣ing here in your way back. Good bye, I'm sory to give you so much trouble—and then, if you should not be able to meet with any of these articles,—</Q></P>
<P>"I'll let you know," replied Harry.— <Q>No, no, not for the world—no, I don't want to hear—if you get them, why, then you'll send them to-morrow, if not, it can't be help't.</Q></P>
<P>A servant now informed Master Lively, that his papa had called for him, upon which Harry took his leave, not very well pleased with the success of his visit; for though his meaning was sincere, when he offered his services, he had no idea of receiving such a multiplicity of commis∣sions.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, "pray, cousins," said Charles, <Q>will you accept of a trifle which my brother and I have been making for you?</Q></P>

<P>What is this the present? What is it?</P>

<P>Now I am just as wise as I was be∣fore.</P>

<P>Dear me, Amelia, you are mistaken, it is to shew the motion of the planets round the sun.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it may be vastly clever to those who comprehend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not quite sure whether you would understand it, so I wrote out this little paper to explain it to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, to be sure, it was impossible

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you made it all yourselves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the plate is made out of an old doll's tea-board that belonged to Mary; so we covered it with paper, painted the circles, and varnished it with thick gum-water. The sun is made of clay, and so indeed are the plan∣ets; but then we stuck gold leaf on the sun to make it look like brass, because the sun in pa∣pa's planetarium is made of brass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, let's see the paper. Did you copy it from the book of astrology that lies on my uncle's table?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I copied part of it from Adam's Essays on the Globes and <HI>Astronomy,</HI> Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, once more, let me read it <STAGE>[opening the paper.]</STAGE> So! it is written in your best hand! Well, hem! <STAGE>[reading.]</STAGE></P>
<P>"The Copernican system consists of the sun, seven primary, twelve secondary planets, and the comets. The seven planets, Mercury, Ve∣nus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus, move round the sun in orbits, included one within the other, and in the order here used in mentioning their names; Mercury being that which is nearest the sun. These seven, which revolve round the sun as their center, are called primary planets: the
<PB N="119" REF="034505_0119_0FFE0ADEADB6BA70"/>twelve small planets revolve round the primary ones as their center, and are at the same time carried round the sun with them; they are there∣fore called secondary planets, moons, or satel∣lites. The Georgium Sidus is attended by two moons, Saturn by five, Jupiter by four, and the Earth by one. All of these, except the last, are invisible to our naked eye, on account of the smallness of their size, and the greatness of their distance from us."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, this is the Copernican system. I wonder why it is called so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! because the sun in the mid∣dle of the planetariums is always made of <HI>cop∣per,</HI> not of brass, as Mr. Charles told us.</P>
<P>This new proof of Amelia's self-conceit and ignorance was so perfectly ridiculous, that the little Davenports could not refrain from laugh∣ter. Amelia was highly affronted, and, in an angry tone of voice, insisted on knowing what was the occasion of their merriment. Mary apologized for her rudeness, but owned that it was impossible to help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, it was rude to laugh, but you made such a droll mistake! I wonder you should be ignorant that it was so called from Copernicus, a Dane, who lived, if I am not mistaken, in the fifteenth century. The
<PB N="120" REF="034505_0120_0FFE0AA1F190F318"/>ancients believed that the sun was the center of the system; but Ptolemy, an Egyptian philos∣opher, treated this notion as a false one, and supposed the earth as the center, and the sun and planets describing their orbits round it. But this opinion was totally rejected by Coper∣nicus, who revived the old system, and estab∣lished it upon firm and indisputable proofs.</P>
</SP>
<P>The conversation now turned upon another subject, and they remained without any more disputes till they went up to dress for dinner. Mrs. Davenport was far from wishing her chil∣dren to give up much of their time to the orna∣ment of their persons, but the always insisted upon their being very clean and neat. Mary and Caroline had the care of their own clothes, and their mama looked them over from time to time, to see that they kept them in proper order.</P>
<P>As they were sitting at table, during dinner, one of the servants delivered a note to Sophia, which, upon opening, she found was from Harry Lively; she immediately guessed the contents, and colouring, crumpled it up, and put it in her pocket. Mr. Easy saw her con∣fusion, and accordingly when dinner was over, asked her from whom she had received the pa∣per she was so desirous of concealing.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="121" REF="034505_0121_0FFE0AE032FD92D8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it's nothing of any consequence, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should rather suspect the con∣trary, as you blushed exceedingly when you looked at it, and seemed fearful of being ob∣served by any one. I shall think you extremly blameable if you do not shew it of your own accord to your aunt, as you ought certainly to keep no secret from her; and I'm certain that if you have got into any difficulty, she will, with her usual indulgence, do all in her pow∣er to assist you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I'd rather not shew it; it can be of no sort of consequence to my aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should wish you volunta∣rily to make a friend of me upon all occasions. Mary and Caroline would not, I am convin∣ced, keep a secret from me upon any account; and why should you behave differently?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't see any harm, Ma'am, in not shewing you every letter I receive, I assure you, Ma'am, there is nothing about <HI>you</HI> in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing about me! Do you then suppose that it is from a motive of curiosity that I wish to see your note?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what it can be else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Easy.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame! for shame, Sophia! You judge of others by yourself. But to con∣clude
<PB N="122" REF="034505_0122_0FFE0AA378FB5760"/>the matter at once; I do not chuse you to receive any letter whatever without acquaint∣ing your uncle, aunt, or myself with its con∣tents; I insist therefore upon your shewing it immediately.</P>
</SP>
<P>"Well, then, there it is," said Sophia, tos∣sing it into the middle of the table,—"there's more fuss made about it than it is worth."</P>
<P>Amelia cast her eye upon it as it lay, and perceiving Harry Lively's name, eagerly snatched it up, and threw it under the table, as she was as unwilling as her sister that it should be seen, knowing that it must infallibly bring them both into a scrape.</P>
<P>Mr. Easy immediately desired her to pick it up; he was vexed at their behaviour, and was determined not to give way to them.</P>
<P>Amelia at first hesitated whether or no she should obey her father; but upon his repeating this command, in a raised tone of voice, she thought it better to comply, and accordingly, with an unwilling hand, delivered it to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Easy just looked it over, and then read as follows: "Harry Lively presents his com∣pliments to the Miss Easys; when he offered his services this morning, he really meant to be of use to them; but if they had considered his offer as a mere compliment, they could not have treated him worse. He returns the list
<PB N="123" REF="034505_0123_0FFE0AE582968D48"/>they furnished him with, and as he understands Mr. Easy is to accompany them, hopes they will have a safe and pleasant journey to town."</P>
<P>The contents of the paper that was inclosed greatly vexed and surprised Mr. Easy: it con∣tained a pack of unintelligible names, all calcu∣lated to raise a laugh against poor Harry.</P>
<P>Mr. Easy severely reprimanded his daughters for this piece of mischief: it was a proof, he said, both of their ingratitude and ill-breeding; he was now convinced that their dispositions would not bear indulgence, and that, for the future, they must expect none from him, as he was determined to try what effect severity would have upon them. He accordingly de∣sired them to go up into their own apartment immediately, and upon no account, to make their appearance till the horses were ready the following morning. Sophia and her sister ne∣ver saw their father so angry before; they had no excuse to make for their behaviour, and not wishing to be farther exposed before their cou∣sins, they instantly obeyed his commands. Up∣stairs they found Ann packing up their clothes; the planetarium lay upon the table, and she was just going to put it in their trunk, when So∣phia snatching it from her, threw it to the other end of the room. "What a fool you
<PB N="124" REF="034505_0124_0FFE0AA6587A9A00"/>are to let it lie there," said Amelia. "Mrs. Set∣to-rights," meaning Mrs. Davenport, "will spy it out, and make mischief of it; you had better put it out of the window at once."</P>
<P>"A good thought! returned Sophia, open the window, and out it shall go! plannatum, or foolatum, or whatever it is called."</P>
<P>While this scene was passing above, Mr. Easy was lamenting the necessity there was of treat∣ing his daughters with the utmost rigour: he <HI>had</HI> hoped to have made companions and friends of them very early in life, but they had, by their late behaviour, destroyed his hopes, and he looked forward to nothing but opposition to the plans he had formed.</P>
<P>Amelia and Sophia, contrary to their fa∣ther's expectation, were punctual to the time appointed for their departure. They were very sulky all breakfast time; and when they heard that the horses were put to, rose up with an eagerness by no means consistent either with gratitude or common politeness, as it plainly evinced their impatience to leave those rela∣tions who had shewed so much true kindness to∣wards them. Mrs. Davenport desired they would write to her as soon as they had reached Q—S—e, that she might know if they had got safe to the end of their journey. They
<PB REF="034505_0125_0FFE0AE70B105238"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="126" REF="034505_0126_0FFE0AA925A659F8"/>promised to comply with her request, but did not think it necessary to thank her for the inte∣rest she took in their welfare. They jumped into the chaise, hardly taking any leave of their cousins, who stood amazed at their be∣haviour. Mr. Easy promised to return in a few days, and tenderly embracing his sister and nieces, followed his unpromising daughters into the carriage, which drove away immedately.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport and his sons mounted their horses at the same time, meaning to accompany them for a few miles.</P>
<P>When they were all out of sight, Mrs. Daven∣port, who had been watching them down the avenue, turned to Mary and Caroline, and kissing them, said, "my dear little girls will, I hope, make a proper use of the scenes they have been witnesses to, and carefully avoid the many errors which their cousins, for want of proper advice, have fallen into."</P>
<P>Mary and Caroline promised their mama they would be more attentive than ever to the advice she was so kind as to give them from time to time, and Mary expressed her happi∣ness at the prospect there was of her cousins amendment, when they should all live toge∣ther, as Mrs. Davenport could then pay the same attention to their morals, as she had done to those of her own children.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="034505_0127_0FFDC679A5F77B80"/>
"At present, my dears, "said Mrs. Daven∣port," they seem but little inclined to listen to any thing for their good. I have endeavoured to be of use to them, but all to no purpose: yet I cannot bring myself to think that their hearts are bad: I rather wish to suppose the impropriety of their behaviour proceeds from a childish heedlessness that has grown to an a∣larming height, by keeping company with girls more foolish than themselves. However, when we all live together, I shall labour with∣out ceasing to correct their faults, and hope one day or other to make them worthy of their father's affection."</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport then desired her daughters to put on their hats, and come with her into the grounds. They passed through that part of the garden directly under the windows of the bed-room which the Miss Easys had occupied. Caroline perceived something laying on the grass, and running to see what it was, felt mor∣tified and surprised to find the little planeta∣rium entirely spoilt. She picked it up, and with tears in her eyes, "see, mama," said she, "what these ill-natured girls have done. My brothers were so happy whilst they were mak∣ing it for them, and now see what it is come to!"—"Poor Charles," said Mary, "how sor∣ry he and his brother will be!"—"This is
<PB N="128" REF="034505_0128_0FFE0AAD2F087F30"/>of a piece," replied Mrs. Davenport, "with their behaviour to Harry Lively; this almost makes me despair of their amendment. I look upon ingratitude as a great crime, and when carried to this height, it fills me with ap∣prehension for their future conduct. But do not let your brothers see this, as I know it will give them pain, and their good nature deserves a better return."—"I'll take it into my own room, directly, mama," returned Caroline; "to be sure it is now of no use, but yet it would be a pity to throw it away, so I'll keep it for my brothers' sake, and whenever I look on it, I shall think of their good nature, and remem∣ber how ungrateful my cousins were about it."—"I would wish you, my dear girl," said her mama, "to make use of every circumstance that may strenghten your affection for Charles and George, but I should rather wish you to throw the planetarium away, than that it should serve to remind you of any unfavourable opinions you may have formed of your cousins."</P>
<P>"Why, mama," said Caroline, "to tell you the truth, I was very glad to see my cousins at first, and I expected to pass many happy days with them; but they turned out to be such ill natured girls, and so different from what I and my sister wished them to be, that I really don't care if I never see them again."</P>

<P>If, Indeed, their friendship is only to be purchased at that price, I do not desire it to subsist between you.

<P>I was never fond of it, my dear children, and it is now too late to begin. But as you both express a liking for that mode of exercise, I should chuse you by all means to learn, as I should then be perfectly easy with regard to your safety whenever you went out.</P>

<P>Pray, mama, did my uncle intend to call upon old Joseph this morning?</P>

<P>He did, my dear: I hope the poor old man is better this morning: he was very bad yesterday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama, George told me he never saw him look so ill before: the weather has been so bad lately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Davenport.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is so infirm, that every change affects him.</P>
</SP>
<P>They now entered the house, and the two little girls went to their studies.</P>
<P>About the usual dinner time, a servant arriv∣ed, sent by Mr. Davenport, to let his family
<PB N="132" REF="034505_0132_0FFE0AB1A1D2D040"/>know he should not return that night, as old Joseph was at the point of death, and he could not leave him in that state. George and Charles likewise remained at the cottage. Up∣on making some inquiries, Mrs. Davenport found that when her brother stopped there in his way to town, Joseph was very ill, and as he was to pass through the town where the physician lived, he immediately went forward with all diligence, and meant to continue his journey with the same speed, that he might re∣turn as soon as possible to his old friend. The servant added, the physician had since arrived, and found his patient in a worse state than either his master or Mr. Easy had suspected him to be; in short, he had declared it to be impos∣sible he should survive that night.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport and her two little girls were sensibly affected with this news: they had no appetite for their dinner, and though they sat at table, hardly eat any thing.</P>
<P>There was a large medicine chest in the housekeeper's-room, the physician was acquaint∣ed with its contents, and had desired a few of the articles to be sent to him at old Joseph's cot∣tage. Mrs. Davenport likewise sent her hus∣band a large wrapping gown, and a great coat to each of her sons, as it was very cold weath∣er to sit up all night. In the course of the
<PB N="133" REF="034505_0133_0FFE0AF231028A10"/>night old Joseph breathed his last. Upon Mr. Easy's return, he settled a small annuity upon the widow and her grand-daughter, and Mr. Davenport placed them in a small cottage with∣in his domains. The Midsummer holidays Miss Easys spent at school; Mrs. Davenport's request of a letter from them was never com∣plied with, a circumstance which gave her no little pain.</P>
<P>Much as she wished'to produce a reformation in these wayward girls, yet she could not help anticipating a little of the anxiety which would attend the execution of her plan; these reflec∣tions would sometimes throw a damp over that mild cheerfulness for which she was so much admired. But now the time arrived for their long-projected journey, the house was al∣ready taken in Berkley Square; some of the servants were on their way to town, and the day was fixed for the departure of the remain∣der of the family. Upon their arrival in town, they sent to inform Mrs. S. the governess.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia, who were not acquaint∣ed with Mr. Davenport's intention of passing a few months of the winter in town, were not a little surprised at the summons to leave school. Mrs. Davenport received them with that affec∣tion which, though so ill merited on their part,
<PB N="134" REF="034505_0134_0FFE0AB46E0BF6C0"/>she could not withhold from the children of a brother she so tenderly loved.</P>
<P>Mr. Easy seldom resided any length of time together in London, when he did, he had lodg∣ings in St. James's street, but as his brother was now in town, apartments were prepared for him in Berkley square.</P>
<P>Mrs. Devenport's arrival in town was soon known by her numerous acquaintance, who were all eager to pay their respect to her; her time was so fully employed in receiving and paying visits, that she found herself totally una∣ble to pursue her usual domestic employments. She therefore intimated to them, that as she came to London solely for the purpose of pro∣curing masters for her children, it was not her intention to launch out into all the dissipations of a gay life. These hints had a desired effect, and Mrs. Davenport soon began to find her ac∣customed pleasure in inspecting the education of her children. She had engaged a governess for them, and had taken no small pains and trouble to procure one in whom she could con∣fide.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying stroke to Sophia and Amelia; they had at first thought their aunt meant to take the care of their education en∣tirely upon herself, without the assistance of a governess. This idea had given them much
<PB N="135" REF="034505_0135_0FFE0AF3C3343C78"/>pleasure, as they concluded that in London she would find but little time to attend to them.</P>
<P>But how were they undeceived when Mrs. Davenport told them she had engaged Mrs. El∣win to be always with them, and to superin∣tend their lessons when she was forced to absent herself from home. Still, however, they were not without hope, this governess might prove more ignorant than themselves, or if this were not the case, perhaps they should be able to im∣pose upon her, coax her into compliance with their idle fits, or else lead her such a life as would induce her to leave the situation. But when this lady came, before she had been one week in the house, they found that none of these schemes were likely to succeed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elwin proved to be a person every way qualified for the charge she had undertaken. Having had much experience in the education of young people, she had acquirrd a degree of penetration that enabled her to discover the source of all their actions; and as she never suffered a bad trait to pass unnoticed, Sophia and Amelia, notwithstanding the plans they had concerted together, began to find it necessary to attend a little to their behaviour.</P>
<P>Their school began in the morning at seven; eight was their breakfast hour; from that time till ten, the music master attended Sophia and
<PB N="136" REF="034505_0136_0FFE0AB88073EBC8"/>Amelia on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; Mary and Caroline on the intervening days; on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, whilst their cousins were employed with their music master, Sophia and Amelia took lessons in drawing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport joined them at ten, when Mrs. Elwin assisted her in instructing them in history and geography. At one, the carriage was always ready to set them down in Hyde Park, or if the ground was very damp, to take them airing. At three they returned home to practise on the harpsichord, and dress for din∣ner, which was served at four o'clock to Mrs. Elwin and her four pupils. After dinner they read French and Italian, and learnt to dance. At eight they left their governess, and went to drink tea with the rest of the family with whom they staid till ten, when (after prayers) they went to bed.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were by no means pleas∣ed with this arrangement of their time; it re∣quired too much application to study to meet with their approbation, and the opinion they entertained of their new governess, may be gathered from the following anecdote:</P>
<P>When this lady had been with them about a fortnight, Mrs. Davenport went out of town for a few days; it was during her absence that Caro∣line
<PB N="137" REF="034505_0137_0FFE0AF913A1C1C0"/>was one night kept awake by a violent tooth-ache. Upon examining her mouth, Mrs. Elwin found it necessary to have immediate re∣course to a dentist; she accordingly ordered the carriage, leaving Mary and the two Miss Easys some French history to get by heart. In about two hours she returned with Caroline in high spirits, having, upon the loss of her tooth, found herself entirely freed from pain. Mary immediately said her lesson perfectly, but her cousins had only learnt a few lines, and those very imperfectly.</P>
<P>Upon inquiry, Mrs. Elwin found that they had been out of the school-room most of the time she was absent, and as this was strictly forbid∣den, she thought it requisite to know what they had been about. Observing ink upon Sophia's fingers, she knew they must have been writing, and in order to discover what, and to whom, she questioned them very closely; but they both affirmed they had not had a pen in their 05 hands. At this moment one of the housemaids entered the room with a letter in her hand, which she gave to Sophia, saying at the same time, "John says, Ma'am, that the man at the post-office says that the letter is above weight, and John wants to know if he is to pay for it."</P>
<P>Mrs. Elwin told the maid she need not wait,

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="139" REF="034505_0139_0FFE0AFA99BE8F98"/>and taking the paper from Sophia, broke it open: it was addressed to a young lady who had been her great friend at school, and con∣tained the following lines:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Dear T—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"After my promise to correspond with you, you have been, no doubt, much surprised at my never having written; but you must know I am so watched, that I have found it impossible till this moment, when one of my Argusses is in the country, the other attending one of my <HI>sweet little cousins</HI> to have a tooth pulled out."</P>
<P>"You know when I left the den at Q—e S—e, I expected to be a little more at lib∣erty, but lo, and <HI>behold,</HI> three days after our ar∣rival at the Hanover Square mansion, and odd kind of a stiff quizzical looking creature was intro∣duced to us upon our return home from a walk, as our governess.—<HI>Governess,</HI> thought I; why, surely, our good Mrs. Davenport is sufficiently vigilent without the assistance of another Duen∣na; but my thoughts were little to the purpose; one spy, it seems, is not enough, and another we have. But this is not all, this Mrs. Elwin has introduced many detestable practices, such as confining her pupils on back-boards, collars, stocks, &amp;c. As for me, it surprised me not a little to be measured for a back-board. You
<PB N="140" REF="034505_0140_0FFE0ABBA3F4DD50"/>know I lest mine in Q—e S—e, where I and Mrs. S. have had many a good battle about it; but to be measured for a new one!— I'll be hang'd if I had not a great mind to knock her brains out with it when it came home. I did contrive to flounce it down on the hearth the second day, and nearly broke her toes; for she sits close to the fire, though we are to keep on the opposite side of the room, the <HI>sweet cousins</HI> and all, <HI>who like it of all things.</HI> Upon my word, it would positively make you sick to see us in our school, as the Duennas are pleased to call it. Close to the fender sits kind Mrs. Elwin opposite to her, our tender hearted aunt; then comes a huge table loaded with French, Italian and English grammars, delightful trea∣tises on geography, history, and <HI>I don't know what all;</HI> then, on four high stools, Amelia, myself, <HI>sleek sensible Mary,</HI> and <HI>elegant little Caroline,</HI> sit perched like the four candles on the ball-room chimney piece in Q—e S—e. But this does not last long, for we have little to learn by heart, but a good deal of <HI>desk-work</HI> (as you call it) such as making extracts from history, copying maps, writing down the lati∣tude and longitude of places I never heard of before, and never wish to do again; then we translate French and Italian, and the duce knows what all. By the bye, I return you your
<PB N="141" REF="034505_0141_0FFE0AFC2255E2F0"/>paper of riddles, for I do believe riddles would be a prophanation in this house, where we are all so mighty learned. Would you believe it, I had a half an hour's lecture for tying up my garters the other day while we were kneeling at prayers in the school-room? For my part I thought it a mighty good opportunity, but our good governess thought otherwise, and talk∣ed so much about what my <HI>duty</HI> was, and how much I ought at those times to think of what I was about, that she positively made me sick.</P>
<P>"Amelia desires me to tell you to give the inclosed letter to her croney, Lady Susan T—, when you see her, and desire her not to an∣swer it.</P>
<P>I wish I were in your case; you have left school, and are to <HI>come out</HI> next year; as for me, 'tis true I am younger, but I don't see why I am not to <HI>come out</HI> at sixteen as well as you; instead of that, I am to be immured up with these nasty Davenports till nineteen, when I promise you I will play sine pranks in spite of past lectures. Did you ever see dumb-bells? They are great lumps of lead inclosed in leath∣er, which we poor nuns are made to hold in our hands, and swing backwards and forwards, to open the chest, as they say; and this slavish
<PB N="142" REF="034505_0142_0FFE0AC0EFAB7DC0"/>task is set us when any of our masters don't come to their hour. I can tell you, 'tis well for all their skulls that these weights are fasten∣ed to my wrists. They say they do it lest they should fall on my toes; but I'll be hanged if they don't suspect me. A propos of masters, that old quiz ******, is still our dancing mas∣ter; he is the most ridiculous, provoking, un∣satisfied animal I ever knew, except some peo∣ple whose names you may guess. But I shall not have time to seal my letter before Cerberus comes home, if I do not now sign myself</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful crony, SOPHIA EASY."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The letter inclosed in the above was much in the same strain. Mrs. Elwin read them over cooly. The sarcasms thrown out against her gave her much less pain than the principles from which they proceeded. When she had finished the perusal of them, she leisurely folded them up, and put them in her pocket, desiring Sophia and Amelia to finish their lessons, and forbidding Mary or Caroline to hold any con∣versation with their cousins till Mrs. Davenport returned, to whom she intended to refer the matter. Sophia and Amelia looked mighty silly upon this discovery being made of their senti∣ments, and still more so, when their aunt came
<PB N="143" REF="034505_0143_0FFE0B0031EFE7B0"/>home the next day. As they had committed an unpardonable fault in writing letters unknown to Mrs. Elwin, this affair was not to be passed over with slight admonition; especially as Mrs. Davenport had long observed that their dispo∣sitions could be wrought on more by severity than gentle means.</P>
<P>They were accordingly sentenced to be shut up for a fortnight in separate rooms, in all which time they were only to be seen or spoken to by their governess: nor were they to be idle during this confinement; they read to Mrs. Elwin, and had such extracts to get by heart, as were calculated to convince them of the im∣propriety of their conduct.</P>
<P>Upon the expiration of a fortnight, their annt gave each of them a letter, in answer to the two that had been intercepted. In these epistles (written by Mr. Davenport) arguments were offered that tended to show the ingratitude and folly of turning into ridicule methods taken for our improvement by those who are kind en∣ough to interest themselves in our welfare.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were much struck with these arguments, and I feel peculiar satisfac∣tion in assuring my readers their relations had never again any great cause to be displeased
<PB N="144" REF="034505_0144_0FFE0AC276177538"/>with them. They were not incorrigible, their hearts were at the bottom good, and the happi∣ness of eradicating those weeds that had so long choaked up their nobler sentiments, fell to the lot of Mrs. Davenport, who well deserved this reward for her care and attention.</P>
