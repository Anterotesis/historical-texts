<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO inculcate the principles of virtue and morality, in the young and ris∣ing generation, is, no doubt, an object of the greatest importance: and to effect this purpose, is the chief inducement with the compiler of this small volume, for in∣truding it on the public.</P>
<P>From the compilation of a youth, peo∣ple arrived at maturity can expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tle novelty or improvement; but as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o∣bable that most of the readers, who shall peruse this volume, will be little more advanced in life than himself, he hopes it may contribute both to their entertain∣ment and instruction.</P>
<P>Should this be the case a which from the opinion of several judicious friends, to whom he has submitted the manuscript, it will, it may prove as an incitement to his proceeding in some other undertaking, which, as he advances further in life, he trusts, may prove more conducive to public utility: to promote which, he knows to be the duty of every good cit∣izen.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="047474_0003_1023B1A0C5A74018"/>It would be ungrateful on the present occasion, to omit returning thanks, to his many friends, who have patronized him with their subscriptions; and happy shall he be, if upon perusal, it is found to answer their expectations.</P>

<HEAD>ON DEVOTION.</HEAD>
<P>DEVOTION, considered simply in itself, is an intercourse betwixt God and us; betwixt the Supreme, self-existent, inconceivable Spirit, which formed and preserves the universe; and that par∣ticular spirit, with which, for awful reasons, he has animated a portion of matter upon earth that we call man. It is a silent act in which the soul di∣vests itself of outward things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wishes, hopes, fears, guilt or pleasures, into the bosom of an Almighty Friend. Though this devotion, in its first stages, may be a wearisome and insipid exercise; yet this arises mere∣ly from the depravity of nature and our passions. A little habit will overcome the reluctance when you have fairly entered upon your journey; the ways of this wisdom will be ways of pleasantness, and all its paths peace. True devotion, doubtless requires a considerable degree of abstraction from the world: hence modern christians treat it as a vi∣sion; hence many modern writers have little of its
<PB N="6" REF="047474_0005_1023B1A2581D4B48"/>
unction; but it glows in the scriptures, it warms us in the fathers, it burned in an Austin, and in ma∣ny others of the persecuted martyrs who are now with God. That we have little of it, is not won∣derful; it makes no noise in the circle of the learn∣ed, or of the elegant under a heap of worldly cares: we smother the lovely infant and will not let it breathe.</P>
<P>Vanity, ambition, pleasure, avarice, quench the celestial fire: and these, alas, are too much the gods of mortals ever since the world began! Wri∣ters have been amusing us only with shadows of this piety, instead of giving us its soul and substance. Superstition has placed it in opinion, ceremonies, austerities, pilgrimages, persecutions, an august temple or splendid imagery, which has little con∣nection with sentiment or spirit. Enthusiasm has swelled with unnatural conceptions, and obtruded a spurious offspring upon the world instead of the engaging child of reason and truth; whilst the luke∣warm and indifferent, have rested in a few outward duties which have had no vigor: and as they spring not from the heart, never entered the temple of the Most High.</P>
<P>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more animated nature; it looks up to God, sees, hears, and feels him in every event, in every vi∣cissitude, in all places, in all seasons and upon all occasions; it is theory vivified by experience, it is faith substantiated by mental enjoyment; it is heaven transplanted in the human bosom; it is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and encircling man; it is a spiritual sense gratfiied by spiritual sensations: without this, all ceremonies are inefficacious; books, prayers, sacraments and meditations, are but a bo∣dy without a soul, or a statue without animation.
<PB N="7" REF="047474_0006_1023B1668E312DC0"/>
That man is capable of having such an intercourse with his Maker, there are many living witnesses to prove, without having recourse to the visions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthusiasts. It may be proved to spring from natural and philosophical causes; God is a spirit, so is the mind. Bodies can have intercourse, so can souls: when minds are in an assimulating state of purity, they are in union with their Maker. This was the bliss of Paradise; sin interrupted, and holiness must restore it to a soul thus disposed. The Creator communicates himself in a manner which is as insensible to the natural eye, as the falling of the dews; but not less refreshing to its secret powers, than that is to vegetation. The primitive saints are describing this when they speak of their transports. David felt it when he longed for God. <HI>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks.</HI> Paul, when he gloried in his tribulations, it was embodied in him when he was carried up into the Third heaven and heard <HI>things impossible to be utter∣ed.</HI> Stephen was filled with it, when he saw the <HI>Heavens opened, and prayed for his murderers.</HI> By it, martyrs were supported when they were stoned and sawed asunder: and till we feel it in ourselves, we shall never fully know how gracious the Lord is. If you can acquire this spiritual abstraction, you will at once have made your fortune for eternity; it will be of little moment what is your lot on earth, or what the distinguishing vicissitudes of your life; prosperity or adversity, health or sickness, honor or disgrace; a cottage or a crown will all be so ma∣ny instruments of glory: the whole creation will become a temple; every event and every object lead your mind to God. And in his greatness and perfection you will insensibly lose the littleness, the glare and tinsel of all human things. If I wish on∣ly
<PB N="8" REF="047474_0007_1023B1A4B543D570"/>
to set off your persons to the greatest advantage, I would recommend this true sublime religion; it gives a pleasing serenity to the countenance, and a chearfulness to the spirits, beyond the reach of art or the power of affectation. It communicates a real transport to the mind, which dissipation mimicks for a moment, a sweetness to the disposition and lustre to the manners, which all the airs of modern polite∣ness study but in vain.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHINA-ASTER.</HEAD>
<P>I PLANTED it with my own hand, said my lit∣tle sister, holding up a withered China-aster, plucked up by the roots.—I covered it from the sun, I watered it night and morning; and after all (wiping her eyes with the corner of her frock) af∣ter all it is dead!—" Alas! how many are the occurrences in life, thought I, which resemble Ma∣ry's flower.—Too easily believing what we wish, we adopt some pretty trifle; and laying it as it were in our bosom, love it "as a daughter." Fan∣cy paints it in gay colors; increasing in beauty, we see its little leaves expand, and trace its progress with anxious solicitude, from the swelling bud to the full blown; and then when we fondly expect to enjoy it, reality tells us after all it is dead!—</P>
<P>How often does an only son engross all the care of his parents, and wind himself round every fibre of their hearts. To cherish the idol, is every wish on the stretch, to indulge it are all the rarities of art and nature procured. Sleepless nights and anx∣ious days, are their lot: and lo! when they hope
<PB N="9" REF="047474_0008_1023B16814B0D448"/>
to see the end of their labors, struck by the hand of disease, or debased by the contaminating touch of vice, the agonizing parents find, after all, it is dead!—</P>
<P>And how sanguine are the expectations of those relations and friends, who possess a lovely girl, en∣dowed with all the charms of beauty and goodness— How do they exult in her very idea!—she is the so∣lace of their calamities, and the staff of dependance for their declining years.—Friendship rises in her defence like a wall; and affection nourishes her like the mild dews of spring—Ah! to how little pur∣pose! The canker-worm of love preys upon the de∣licate root of this sweet sensitive, and the scorch∣ing winds of disappointment drink up its moisture! —It fades—The hands of friendship and af∣fection are united to support it in vain: for

<P>It languishes and dies—and regret bitterly weeping, raves round the lovely fallen, and ex∣claims after all, it is dead!—* * * &amp;c.</P>

<P>TIME is precious, but its value is unknown to us. We shall attain this knowledge when we can no longer profit by it. Our friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quire it of us, as if it was nothing; and we give it to them in the same manner.

about it. The day will arrive, when a quarter of an hour will appear more desirable than all the riches in the universe. God who is liberal and ge∣nerous in all his other gifts, teaches us by the wise economy of his providence, how circumspect we ought to be in the right management of our time; for he never gives us two moments together, he gives only the second as he takes away the first, and keeps the third in his hands, leaving us in an abso∣lute uncertainty whether it shall ever be ours or not.</P>
<P>Time is given us that we may take care of eter∣nity; and—eternity will not be too long to regret the loss of our time if we have mispent it.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO YOUNG WOMEN</HEAD>
<P>MY <HI>Daughter give me thy heart.</HI> Thy supreme affection none on earth can deserve; hu∣man attainments are all defective; human regards are often insincere. Put not your trust in the son of man; he may deceive, or he may change, or he may not be able to protect you: but of this kind you have nothing to fear from your Creator.</P>
<P>Every thing in nature is subject to vicissitude; and—nothing is more usual than for men to adopt a different deportment, as their circumstances or in∣terests, their opinions or humors, vary. There is but one immutable friend that sticks closer than a brother a lover or a parent. He is the same yester∣day, to day and forever. He will never leave you; he will never forsake you; he has engaged himself by his promise; and he is not a man that he should repent.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="047474_0010_1023B169E3E61040"/>And now suppose that a woman possessed with a belief of the highest excellence, is disappointed in her prospects of an agreeable union with one of our sex: she turns her thoughts to heaven. She con∣templates truth and rectitude, wisdom and good∣ness, power, mercy and faithfulness in their source. she considers them as all—working together for her good; she sees them shining through the cloud of disappointment; from this cloud she hears, as it were, her Maker thus addressing her, "<HI>My daugh∣ter, give me thy heart; throw thyself, my child, on my friendship.</HI> She is not disobedient to the hea∣venly call.—She prostrates herself in the presence of the Most High.

<HEAD>ON RETIREMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FEW will be found to display prudence or con∣sistency of conduct, who do not sometimes step asid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the tumult of the throng, to consider coolly their circumstances and situations. Life can∣not proceed fortuitously, without incurring momen∣tary danger. Plans of conduct must be formed, precautions taken, errors retrieved, and probabil∣ities of futurity considered: but all this requires thought, and thought retirement.</P>
<P>It will conduce in a particular manner to the peace of all persons who superintend large families, if they habituate themselves to disregard those calumnies, which will certainly be poured upon them; though they should not merit ill treatment. Their hearts, will indeed be often wrung with grief, if they are
<PB N="12" REF="047474_0011_1023B1A91B082698"/>
sensible of every ill-natured whisper, which makes its way, like the worm in the earth, and may at last, corrode the worthiest bosom, if the breast-plate of reason is not previously applied.</P>
<P>What have we to do, but to perform our duty, and leave the event to Providence. Religion is the only safe refuge of a heart laboring under heavy calamities. Religion makes the most truly serene and chearful countenances.</P>
<P>THERE is no terrestrial good that can yield that substantial happiness which is suited to the natures and desires of the human mind; and he who thinks to find it in any thing beneath the sun, is surprising a phantom that will elude his chase; and if it seem to loiter for his approach, it will only be to con∣vince him of his folly; to shew him a mistake that he never saw, and of which thousands never thought till their race terminated in that country, from whence none ever returned to own their error, or confess their shame.</P>

<HEAD>POOR JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>A POOR half-witted man, named Joseph, whose employ was to go on errands, and carry par∣cels, passing through London streets one day, heard psalm-singing in a place of worship; he went into it, having a large parcel of yarn hanging over his shoulders: it was Dr. Calamy's meeting-house, St. Mary's, Aldermanbury. A very well dressed audi∣ence
<PB N="13" REF="047474_0012_1023B16C5D22E490"/>
surrounded the Doctor. He read the text in 1st Tim. I. 15. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." From this he preached in the clearest and simplest manner, the ancient apostolic gospel, the contents of this faithful saying, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is salvation for the vilest sinners, solely through the worthiness of Jesus Christ, the God who made all things. "Not many rich, not many noble, are called by this doc∣trine (saith the apostle) but God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things that are mighty." While the elegant assembly list∣lessly heard this doctrine, and if they were struck with any thing at all, it was only with some brilliant expression or well turned period that dropped from the Doctor. Joseph, in rags, gazing with aston∣ishment, never took his eyes from the preacher, but drank in with eagerness all he said: and trudging homeward, was heard thus muttering to himself; "Jesus Christ, the God who made all things, came into the world to save sinners, like Joseph; and this is true; and it is a "faithful saying." Not long after this, Joseph was seized with a fever and was dangerously ill. As he tossed upon his bed, his constant language was, "Joseph is the chief of sin∣ners; but Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, and Joseph loves him for this." His neigh∣bors who came to see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wondered at hear∣ing him always dwelling on this. Some of the religious sort addressed him in the following man∣ner:—But what say you of your own heart, Jo∣seph? is there no token for good about it? no say∣ing change there? Have you closed with Christ, by acting faith upon him? "Ah! no (says he) Joseph can act nothing; Joseph has nothing to say for him∣self,
<PB N="14" REF="047474_0013_1023B1AC98FD81B8"/>
but just that he is chief of sinners; yet seeing it is a faithful saying, that Jesus, he who made all things, came into the world to save sin∣ners, why may not Joseph, after all, be sav∣ed?" One man finding out where he heard this doctrine, on which he dwelt so uniformly, and with such delight, went and asked Doctor Calamy to come and visit him. He came; but Joseph was now very weak, and had not spoken for some time, and though told of the Doctor's arrival, he took no no∣tice of him; but when the Doctor began to speak to to him, as soon as he heard the sound of his voice, he instantly sprang up on his elbows, and seizing him by the hands, exclaimed as loud as he could, with his now feeble and trembling voice, "O Sir, you are the friend of the Lord Jesus, who I heard speak so well of him, and whom I love for what you said of him. Joseph is the chief of sinners; but it is a faithful saying, that Jesus Christ, the God who made all things, came into the world to save sinners, and why not Joseph? O pray to that Je∣sus for me, pray that he may save me: tell him that Joseph thinks he loves him, for coming into the world to save such sinners as Joseph." The Doctor prayed. When he concluded, Joseph thanke him more kindly: he then put his hand under the pillow and took out an old rag, in which were tied up five guineas; and putting it into the Doctor's hand, (which he had kept all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time close in his) he thus addressed him, "Jose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n his folly, had laid up this to keep him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d age: but Joseph will ne∣ver see old age; take it, and divide it amongst the poor friends of the Lord Jesus, and tell them that Joseph gave it them for his sake who came into the world to save sinners, "of whom he is chief." So saying, he reclined his head. His exertions in talk∣ing,

had been too much for him, so that he instant∣ly expired.</P>

<HEAD>PALEMON AND THIRSIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE shades of the evening had begun to spread their dimming gloom over the plains, when Palemon, who, with his son Thirsis, had just fold∣ed their flock, slowly returning to their peaceful dwelling. Palemon had long been an inhabitant of these uplands. His head was silvered over with age. Thirsis had just reached that ascending period of life which verges on manhood. A lively filial respect was implanted in his breast towards the venerable author of his being. He looked up to him, not on∣ly for support, but for that advice, by which he was to guide his steps through the thorny roads of life. Every admonition that fell from his father's lips, he treasured up in his mind, and noted every precept on the tablet of his heart.</P>
<P>Slowly returned they towards their home; for time had now abated the vigor of the parent. "Be∣hold, my son," cried the hoary-headed sage, as they moved on, side by side, "Behold how every appearance marks the approach of winter! The grove is no longer rendered vocal by the sweet choirsters that lately tuned, among its branches, their sweetest lay. The scene around us yields not its wonted pleasure. Its beauty fades apace. All nature seems to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if apprehensive of those dreary clouds wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will overcast you azure sky.</P>
<P>"How cheer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was that very scene, which is now enw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dejecting gloom! Ri∣pening crops of grain then waved to the gentle breeze; a breeze fraught with refreshing fragrance from yonder balmy meads aside fruitful plains, now, alas! stripped of their flowery vestment, and, with it, of their enlivening odours.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="047474_0016_1023B1720A520F30"/>"Then, as we early sought the fold, while yet Aurora lighted up the dawn, or when, at our re∣turn, the evening resumed her gentle reign, sooth∣ed by the nightingale's melodious notes, we tasted all the sweets by bounteous nature spread. But now, which ever way we turn, the fading prospect sickens to our view. The wood-land's variegated dyes, drooping, proclaim in oft repeated sighs, the summer's last farewell. No more, ye fields, the flowrets deck your glades; no more the trees their verdant foliage wave; no more the warblers chear the listening swain. Stern winter's chill approach has changed the scene.</P>
<P>"But why, my son, do we lament these transi∣ent pleasures flown? Spring shall return and deck again the ravag'd plain; and nature lose again her wintry form, though not perhaps for me.—My summer too is closed. But the bright cherub Hope, presents a prospect far beyond the skies, where hap∣pier fields enjoy a cloudless day, and groves immor∣tal wear unfading bloom.</P>
<P>"Let, Thirsis, this clear ray of hope, beam ever in thy breast. Thou then wilt not regret the fad∣ing beauties of the transient spring, nor heed the terrors of the northern blast. A few revolving suns may bring the change w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> lands me on that peaceful shore, where wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns shall ne'er dis∣turb the scene; but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rlasting spring shall reign.

<P>Thus, as they walked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>efluously flowed the admonitions of the hoary sage. Nor were they lost, they were treasured up in the mind of Thirsis.— When his venerable parent slept underneath the grassy sod, he became as Palemon had been, esteem∣ed by all the country round, for the simplicity of his manners, and the rectitude of his conduct.</P>

<HEAD>COMMON PURSUITS.</HEAD>
<P>SO much have our <HI>common pursuits,</HI> which we plead as the means of supporting life, diverted men from the true ends for which they were sent into the world, that the judicious and pious, in all ages, since the time of Solomon, have readily sub∣scribed to his opinion, that all of them are indeed "vanity and vexation of spirit." For we find that there are some who spend their whole time in gram∣mar and rhetoric, or in learning to speak well, without allowing themselves any leisure to study the more important concerns of living well.</P>

<HEAD>CANUTE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a remarkable passage in the life of Canute, king of England, containing instruc∣tions both to prince and people. His courtiers, (ever too prone to magnify and flatter those whom they think to please by so doing) would frequently extol his power and wealth, and pretend some∣times almost to adore his person. Canute was a man of too good understanding not to see the folly of such flattery, and of the persons from whom it came; but for their effectual conviction, and to shew the small power of kings, he caused his roy∣al seat to be placed on the sea-shore, while the tide was comming in; then, in the midst of his flatter∣ing nobles and great lords, whom he caused to as∣semble together for that purpose; arrayed in robes of gold with his crown on his head, and all the state and royalty he could command, he thus ad∣dressed the sea. "Thou sea, belongest to me, and the land whereon I sit is mine, nor hath any one unpunished resisted my commands; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge thee, therefore, come no farther upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and, neither presume to wet the feet of thy sovereign lord." But the sea came rolling on, and, without rever∣ence, wet and dashed the king. Then rising from his seat, and looking round him, he desired all present to behold the weakness of human power, and that none truly deserved the name of king, but him whose eternal laws both heaven, earth and seas obey. From that time he never wore a crown, esteeming earthly royalty nothing else than poor contemptible vanity.</P>

<P>A CERTAIN Hermit had scooped his cave near the summit of a lofty mountain, from whence he had an opportunity of surveying a large extent both of sea and land. He sat one evening contem∣plating with pleasure on the various objects that lay diffused before him. The woods were dressed in the brightest verdure; the thickets adorned with the gayest blossoms.

<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a wild, unknown to public view,</L>
<L>From youth to age, a rev'rend hermit grew;</L>
<L>The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well;</L>
<L>Remote from man, with God he pass'd his days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all his business, all his pleasure praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd heav'n itself, till one suggestion rose—</L>
<L>That vice should triumph, virtue vice obey;</L>
<L>This sprung some doubts of Providence's sway:</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenor of his soul is lost.</L>
<L>So when a smooth expanse receives imprest</L>
<L>Calm nature's image on its wat'ry breast,</L>
<L>Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,</L>
<L>And skies beneath the answ'ring colours glow:</L>
<L>But if a stone the gentle sea divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And glimmering fragments of a broken sun;</L>
<L>Banks, trees, and skies in thick disorder run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books or swains report it right,</L>
<L>(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,</L>
<L>Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)</L>
<L>We quits his cell; the pilgrim staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the scallop in his hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
</LG>

<L>The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass:</L>
<L>But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;</L>
<L>His raiment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft, in graceful ringless, wav'd his hair:</L>
<L>Then near appreaching, "Father hail!" he cry'd;</L>
<L>And "hail my son!" the rev'rend sire reply'd:</L>
<L>Words follow'd words; from question answer flow'd;</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road:</L>
<L>Till with each other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their age they differ, join in heart.</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound,</L>

<L>Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd the noble master of the dome</L>

<L>Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neighbouring wood to banish sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the guests, obedient to the call,</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall:</L>
<L>Rich luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste.</L>
<L>Then, pleas'd and thankful, from the porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:</L>
<L>His cup was vanish'd; for in secret guise</L>
<L>The younger guest purloin'd the glittering prize.</L>

<L>So seem'd the sire, when, far upon the road,</L>
<L>The shining spoil his wiley partner show'd.</L>
<L>He stopp'd with silence, walk'd with trembling heart,</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That gen'rous actions meet a base reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds;</L>
<L>The changing skies hang out their sable clouds;</L>
<L>A sound in air pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag'd approaching rain,</L>
<L>And beasts to covert scud across the plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the signs, the wand'ring pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring feat:</L>
<L>'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, and unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its owner's temper, tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a desart there.</L>
<L>As near the miser's heavy doors they drew,</L>

<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunders ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock: but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind and batter'd by the rain.</L>
<L>At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,</L>
<L>('Twas then his threshold first reciev'd a guest:)</L>
<L>Slow creeking, turns the door with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair.</L>
<L>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And nature's fervour through their limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with meagre wine,</L>
<L>(Each hardly granted) serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With still remark the pond'rous hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one so rich, a life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And why should such (within himself he cry'd)</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L>But what new marks of wonder soon took place</L>
<L>In ev'ry settling feature of his face,</L>
<L>When from his vest the young companion bore</L>
<L>That cup the gen'rous landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious bowl</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of this churlish soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the clouds in airy tumult fly;</L>
<L>The sun, emerging, opes an azure sky:</L>
<L>A fresher green the smiling leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the day:</L>
<L>The weather courts them from their poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad master bolts the wary gate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While hence they walk, the pilgrim's bosom wrought</L>

<HEAD>A Poem on our <HI>SAVIOUR'S</HI> Nativity.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN Bethlehem's fields those pastures large and fair,</L>
<L>As shepherds watch'd by night their fleecy care,</L>
<L>A dazzling light, without the sun return'd,</L>
<L>And thro' the midnight's dusky horror burn'd.</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="047474_0106_1023B267A7ACFF68"/>Sonorous voices trembling from afar,</L>
<L>And softly warbled through the trembling air.</L>
<L>When soon, behold! the solemn silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus, in pleasing words the angels spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Immortal glory give to God on high,</L>
<L>Through all the lofty stations of the sky:</L>
<L>Let joy on earth, and endless peace ensue;</L>
<L>The great Messiah's born! thrice happy men! to you.</L>
<L>The great Messiah born! transporting sound!</L>
<L>To the wide world spread the bless'd accents round,</L>
<L>What joy these long expected tidings bring!</L>
<L>To us is born a Saviour and a King.</L>
<L>An infant in a virgin's arms he lies,</L>
<L>Who rides the winds, and thunders thro' the skies,</L>
<L>The God to whom the flaming seraph's bow,</L>
<L>Descends to lead the life of mortals now.</L>
<L>Come, we will lead you to the bless'd abode,</L>
<L>Where in a manger lies th' incarnate God;</L>
<L>Reduc'd to lodge among the sordid beasts,</L>
<L>Who all the spacious realms of light possess'd;</L>
<L>And he, whose humble ministers we are,</L>
<L>Becomes a tender virgin's helpless care.</L>
<L>Thro' heaven but now the hasty tidings rung,</L>
<L>And anthems on the wond'rous theme they sung.</L>
<L>Let air and heaven with joyful accents ring</L>
<L>In praises to the great Almighty King▪</L>
<L>Let ev'ry mortal catch the happy sound,</L>
<L>And Peace and Happiness on earth abound.</L>

<HEAD><HI>A HYMN,</HI> Supposed to have been written by an English Officer.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAIL Sovereign Lord, that first began</L>
<L>The scheme to rescue fallen man;</L>
<L>Hail matchless, free, eternal grace,</L>
<L>That gave my soul a hiding-place!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Against the God that rules the sky,</L>
<L>I fought with hands uplifted high;</L>
<L>Despis'd the mercies of his grace,</L>
<L>Too grand to seek a hiding-place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inwrap'd in thick Egyptian night,</L>
<L>And fond of darkness more than light.</L>
<L>Madly I run the sinful race,</L>
<L>Secure without a hiding-place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thus eternal counsel ran,</L>
<L>"Almighty pow'r arrest the man;"</L>
<L>I felt the arrows of distress,</L>
<L>And found I had no hiding-place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Indignant Justice stood in view,</L>
<L>To Sinai's fiery mount I flew;</L>
<L>But Justice cry'd with frowning face,</L>
<L>"This mountain is no hiding-place."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length a heavenly voice I heard,</L>
<L>And mercy for my soul appear'd,</L>
<L>Which led me on with pleasing face,</L>
<L>To Jesus as my hiding-place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should storms of sevenfold thunders roll,</L>
<L>And shake the globe from pole to pole;</L>
<L>No thunder-bolts would daunt my face.</L>
<L>For Jesus is my hiding-place.</L>
