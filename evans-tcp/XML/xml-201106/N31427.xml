<HEAD>MR. HOOBY's ADVICE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved in Jesus Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE these lines reach you, the hand that writes them, will be mouldering in the dust. Receive them, not as from mine house upon earth;— but within it, dated from the grave, that house appointed for you, and all the living, dead Abel yet speaketh,—he only speaketh, that he may bring you to that precious Blood which speaketh better things than the blood of Abel, crying aloud for pardon, peace, reconciliation and salvation. God is my wit∣ness, you were my past concern; God grant you may be my future joy. That concern, and the hope of this joy, is the cause of these lines, which as they find you now looking towards a resettlement, so are designed thro' divine grace, to assist you therein.</P>
<P>REALIZE, my dearly beloved, that it is a great work you are entering upon and a great blessing that you stand in need of. Look upon your families look upon your dear children, that you must quickly leave behind you, and, with the most importunate concern, realize how greatly their safety, welfare, comfort and happiness, for time and for eternity may turn upon your receiving such a blessing. Realize again, the op∣position you are likely to meet with in your way to it. My death, I doubt not, gives satan more life. The scythe that cuts down God's ministers, makes way for the enemy to sow tares, and furnishes him
<PB N="3" REF="041550_0003_101AB51B27263B68" MS="y"/>with the prospect of a large harvest. Oh! be strongly on your guard against a mind prepared to receive them. And therefore put away all pride, anger, envy, headiness, selfishness and the like, such-like tempers are his hope, and your amazing danger. Yet however greatly concerned, be not distressed. God liveth God loveth, and Christ intercedeth. A proper con∣cern for yourselves is a proof of the divine concern for you; and while the blood of Christ is precious to you, fear not that he will leave you destitute of a faithful pastor, the purchase of that blood—That you may obtain which, let me solemnly charge you to begin with prayer and fasting, and humiliation. God lays his beams in the waters; so must you too, in the deep waters of repentance, if you would have him dwell with you, in that house of his which is the church. From him cometh every good gift, and es∣pecially that great good, a pastor after his own heart. But he will be sought to, for it. Oh go to him, and be glad that you may do so. Pour out your tears, and your souls into his bosom. Confess your sins before him, particularly whatever has been amiss in your conduct towards your former pastors. And especially your carelesness to profit by their ministrati∣ons. Acknowledge God's justice in taking them away, and your own unworthiness of another. Yet plead with him, his goodness, mercy, his promise and that how great soever is your unworthiness, the more divinely bright will his grace appear in overcoming it. You must see your own unworthiness, of such a blessing, if you may expect to receive it; and your acknowledg∣ing that unworthiness is the way to the blessing. Not only pray, but continue in prayers; feel your own want, and wrestle with God for the supply of it.
<PB N="4" REF="041550_0004_101AB51CA8E6B400"/>Wrestle till you prevail. If you will take no denial, God will give you no refusal. There is a kind of omnipotency in prayers yea, may I not say it overcomes omnipotence itself, disarms God of his anger and extorts that language from him, Commad ye me.</P>
<P>AND now having sought to God.—In the next place take council of men; especially of the Minsters of Christ round about you: many of whom, blessed be God, are of amiable capacity, gracious integrity, and who will naturally care for your state. But beware of poor lowspirited, selfish and false advisers. Be well advised in yourselves, in order to your receiving the best advice of others.—And now supposing you to have made application to some gentleman with a veiw to settle.— Be ye watchful.—Be watchful over yourselves, against all prejudice, one way or another. Especially be watchful over your affections; these often blind the understanding, and blind the judgment. Don't judge of a minister as you do of a bell, by the mere sound, nor by mere outward appearances; such as air, manner, address, delivery and the like. These, however pleas∣ing, are but the mere work of nature, or the business of art. It is not all gold that glistens. Take heed how ye hear—In the next place be watchful of him. Watch narrowly his preaching. Take heed what you hear. Examine whether his preaching be close, pun∣gent, and particular; or only large, vague and general; whether by bringing in bad principles, he do not cor∣rupt the truth of Christ and endanger your souls; or whether he do not cunningly conceal his principles for the present, that so he and his bad principles may creep in unawares together. Do you hear any thing of the imputation of Adam's sin, and of Christ's righteousness, the depravity of man's nature, and the
<PB N="5" REF="041550_0005_101AB51E5BD82898" MS="y"/>necessity of efficacious grace; doth he preach Christ, as the all in all of man, his wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption; if, not, shun him as you would a post.—Again be watchful over his con∣duct whether it discovers sincerity and honesty, wisdom and prudence, the reason of a man, the judgment of a scholar, the grace of a christian, and the exempla∣riness of a minister.—Again, be watchful to know his principles as a divine: here let me charge you, as you will answer it at the great day, that you don't settle in the dark, and never was greater need of such a charge, than at this day; because never greater dan∣ger of the gospel of God's grace; it being perverted into a gospel without any grace at all. You have a right to know his principles. And if you neglect this right, I fear God is blinding in order to destory you. Remember how and what you have received and heard, and hold fast. Religion, I am confident, will be likely to live, as those doctrines, which, for distinction sake, are called calvinistic, live, or so die, as they die. And if upon examination of the matter you find that the man's principles are not settled, I beseech you settle not yet the man.—Once more, be watchful not only that the principles of the man be good, but that he be also a good man himself; that he have a good heart, as well as a good head.—Endeavour that the man of your choice be also one whom the Lord hath chosen to himself. God may indeed make use of a bad man to bring about good designs; but it is not likely that one who is but a vessel in which he has no plea∣sure should be used as a vessel of honour to bear God's name and grace unto his people: no; such an one is a chosen vessel; them that honour God, will God honour. However, much caution and modesty is to
<PB N="6" REF="041550_0006_101AB51FEBD9BD10"/>be used in this matter, and much christian charity; for tho' it would be egregious folly in you to commit the care of your souls to one that manifested no care of his own; yet there may be much censoriousness in determining that he has no such care, or doth not manifest it: and where there is this censoriousness, there is always pride; and where pride is, there is a demonstration that you have not taken sufficient care of your own souls. Here therefore let your zeal be accompanied with the meekness of wisdom. Pru∣dence is profitable to direct. Furthermore, in order to abtain this desired blessing, not only watch and pray, consult and advise, but also wait too. Such a mine is not easily dug. Such a blessing is not pre∣sently obtained. Guard therefore against all precipi∣tancy. Take time and you will not only do it the better, but do it the sooner. A few months may de∣ceive you into anxiety, when a longer time may open your eyes to your full quiet and satisfaction. The apostle requires that a deacon be first proved or tried. Of how much more grand importance is it that a gospel bishop should be so. How immense the riches committed to their trust. I humbly trust that the ministers of Christ will be careful that they do not lay hands suddenly upon any man. And I solemnly charge you as from the world of eternity, that you do not lift up your hands suddenly for any man.</P>
<P>AND now my beloved people, to hasten to a long farewell. Having given you that advice, which my love and concern for you have inspired, and which I am persuaded the Spirit of God approves; and in the humble hope that you will obtain the blessing I so earnestly desire for you; let me request and demand in the name of Christ my dear Master, that you think
<PB N="7" REF="041550_0007_101AB522F8122BF8"/>nothing too much to do for such a pastor; and did you know the heart of a minister, you would think so indeed, and by every method, endeavour to sooth and ease it. Before you receive these lines, I shall be free from the danger of a selfish spirit myself, and the suspicion of it in you. 'Tis your interest I am seeking, and if you are dear to your pastor, as you will be if you choose such an one as I have pointed out, Oh! let him be dear to you; if he preaches to you the true gospel, he deserves to live of the gospel. Though he can merit nothing of his master, yet he in his name merits much of you. If he sows to you in spirtiual thing, don't think it much if he reap of you carnal things—A rich minister, I readily grant, has always been the bane of religion; but let me assure you, that an impoverished ministry always will be so. Beware of Jeroboam's priests, lest discontented with their condition, they become Jeroboams them∣selves. Let your minister have enough to keep him chose in his study, that he may serve God and you without distraction; to give honourably to him is to do honour to God and get good to yourselves,— And now having vented the love of a friend, and the heart of a pastor, hearken to my last words, which speak to you in this wise.</P>
<P>DEARLY <HI>Beloved,</HI> See that you fall not out by the way. Be of one mind as far as possible: if not, be of one heart. Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye; and above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, and let the peace of God rule in your
<PB N="8" REF="041550_0008_101AB52539B05F20"/>hearts. To whose blessing I earnestly commend you in Chirst Jesus, praying that all you, and I, may meet as his right hand, and spend an eternity in praising him, and God his father for him,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>This is the last farewell of your Once affectionate pastor,</HI> W. HOOBY, <HI>Now no more</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
