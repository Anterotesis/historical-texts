</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MARRIAGE is an ordinance of God, early instituted, designed for his glory, and the social comfort of mankind—that they might not only be help-meets to each other in this world, but that they might help one another forward in their Christian course towards God's heavenly kingdom. But alas how thoughtless do many rush into the marriage state, as thoughtless as if God was not to be honored there∣by, as stupid as if they were not accountable crea∣tures—But, notwithstanding their insensibility and stupidity, God often over-rules it so, that such a thoughtless pair often live comfortably in this world a sure evidence that God's tender mercies are over all his works.—God designed the marriage union <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be a lively emblem of Christ and his church, Isa. lx <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.5. For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sons marry thee, and as the bridegroom rejoiceth ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="4" REF="043980_0003_101DADB3AB17FB80"/>the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. Isa. liv. 1. Thy maker is thy husband. Eph. v. at the latter end. There is a most near relation between a man and his wife, when they come together as they ought: when they marry in the Lord. 1 Cor. vi. 29. If this union is not near and sacred, would the Holy Ghost thus have indited the canticles! What endear∣ing expressions are there used, to set forth Christ and his church. Happy is the pair that thus meet to∣gether according to God's direction, when the nuptial bands are tied, they shall never fail of a blessing: They shall have every thing that is best for them in this world, and in the world to come everlasting life; they shall live together as the heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindred.</P>
<P>We have an account in our text, where Jesus was called, invited to a wedding, and where he wrought his first miracle, and turned water into wine: He graced the marriage with his presence: The guests were astonished at the good wine that was brought forth at the last.</P>
<P>This is a sure evidence that marriage is an ordi∣nance of God, and that God designs to be honored thereby; and those that invite Jesus to their marriage, shall find a blessing, shall taste that love that is better than wine.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>When a couple are about to enter into the sacred covenant of marriage, it is their duty to invite Jesus to the wedding.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="043980_0004_101DADB7C461F6A8"/>
To illustrate my doctrine, I shall,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Shew what is implied in inviting Jesus to a wedding.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That it is the duty of all when they marry so to do.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. Then, what is implied in inviting Jesus to a wedding; there is many things implied in it. Persons when they are about to marry are thinking about the guests they design to have at their wedding; they do not usually invite any but their friends, but those that are near to them. Sometimes persons invite those to wedding they do not really want, for fear of affronting them; so a person may invite Jesus for fear of punishment—for fear they shall be sent to hell, if they do not ask the presence of God, when they really do not want the presence of God, when they really do not want the presence of God there—but this is not a right way of inviting Jesus, of calling him to the wedding. But,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is implied in inviting Jesus to the wed∣ding; that when a person desires to marry, he looks to Jesus for direction; if persons desire Jesus at the marriage, they will look to God for direction; that they may be directed to a suitable person—one that may be an help-meet to them—one of a suitable temper and disposition—one who they may live com∣fortable with in this world—but especially one who may be an help-meet to them, to help them forward towards the heavenly Canaan—one who is an heir of the grace of life, that they may so live together that their prayers may not be hindred. 1 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. iii. 7</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="043980_0005_101DADB946313480"/>
2. It implies that they themselves are friends to Jesus, and have a high esteem of him, and love for him, that their whole dependance is upon God, and that they will be much in prayer to God for direction and counsel in this great affair; this is the greatest affair that persons transact in this world, with regard to themselves, and worldly things; it is for life of one or the other. When they marry if they so come together, as to live as heirs of the grace of life; how great a blessing! but if otherwise, how great a curse!—Therefore the person that desires Jesus at the wed∣ding, will take his counsel and direction: When he is about to seek a partner of his <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>woes,</HI> he will be much in prayer to God for his blessing.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to shew th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when a couple are about to marry, it is their duty to call Jesus, to invite Jesus to the wedding; and this will appear plainly if we consider a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because marriage is an ordinance of God. Gen. ii. 18 and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and context, so 1 Cor. ii. 7. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> xiii. 4. Marriage is of God's appointing—it is an ordinance he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordained, and Christ him∣self (in the day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fiel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) graced it with his pre∣sence; therefore it is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all when they mar∣ry to invite Jesus to the wedding.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the duty when persons are about to mar∣ry to invite Jesus to the wedding, because marriage, or the marriage covenant, represents Christ and his church, Tim. iii. 14▪ Turn, O backsliding chil∣dren saith the Lord, for I am married unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> ii. 7▪ I will go and return to my first hus∣band
<PB N="7" REF="043980_0006_101DADBC3174BC70"/>for then it was better with me than now. Isai. lxii. 5. For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee, and as the bridegroom re∣joiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</P>
<P>The union between husband and wife is so near, it represents Christ and his church, the Holy Ghost makes use of this union, this nearness, this love, throughout the whole of the divine Song of Solo∣mon, to represent the mystical marriage, love and union between Christ and his church. Eph. v. 30.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because they have no promise of living com∣fortable in this world, or of making an happy end at last, unless Jesus be with them, unless they ask his presence, and invite him to the wedding. It is as much their duty to call upon Jesus to come to this ordinance as any other.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because there will be no true joy if Jesus be not there, nothing but carnal meriment; there may be carnal meriment and carnal joys where Jesus is not; but these are short lived pleasures which will bring bitterness in the latter end. At last they will bite like a serpent and sting like an adder. But if Jesus be there, there will be joy worth having. It is worth while to go to wedding where Jesus is to taste the good wine. Where Jesus is, the children of the bride chamber cannot mourn; "Can the children of the bride chamber mourn, while the bridegroom is with them." Matt. ix. 15.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. and lastly. Because Jesus will come and bless them if they invite him; he will not do as ma∣ny
<PB N="8" REF="043980_0007_101DADC198739138"/>do when they have been treated exceeding ill, though afterwards they may invite them to their wedding, yet they remember their former ill treat∣ment and will not come. It is not so with Jesus: However ill he has been treated time after time— been dispifed and rejected by them; yet, if when they are about to marry, if they sincerely invite him, if they desire his presence; he will remember none of his former ill treatment against them but will come and bless them; he will give them delicious fare! they shall taste that love that is better than wine.</P>
<P>I shall close this discourse by addressing myself to several sorts of persons, and</P>
<P N="1">1. To the bridegroom and the bride, who are now about to enter into the solemn covenant of mar∣riage. My dear friends is our doctrine true, that when a couple are about to enter into the sacred co∣venant of marriage, it is their duty to invite Jesus to the wedding Of what importance then is it that you have the presence of Jesus with you. I trust and hope you have thought solemnly of this great transaction, before now, and looked to Jesus for counsel, and given him a sincere invitation to the wedding. If so you will have his presence with you and blessing to attend you, and he will give you every needed blessing, every thing that is best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you in this would, and in the world to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever∣lasting.</P>
<P>It is my hearty desire and prayer to God for you that you may grow up into a family: a family of religion, a family that will always call upon God.
<PB N="9" REF="043980_0008_101DADC49EEC8CB8"/>That you may have the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: That you may live together as heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder∣ed. May you so live together in this world, as to become a lively emblem of the bride, the Lamb's wife, and finally be admited to that state and world, where there is neither marriage nor giving in marri∣age, but where you will be as the angels of God in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. I shall address myself to the unmarried in this assembly. Is our doctrine true; is it the duty of all when they marry to invite Jesus to the wedding. Of how much importance is it then that you become friendly to Jesus! That you marry to him before you marry to one another, before you are married in this life—For as we have shewn, friendship to Jesus, is implied in inviting him to the wedding. Depend∣ence upon him and love to him; seeking to God by prayer for direction and council in this great affair; this temper and disposition of heart you must have, otherwise you will not call Jesus to the wedding.</P>
<P>O of what importance is it then, that you be united to Jesus, in that covenant of which marriage is an emblem! And, if friendship to Jesus is implied in inviting him to the wedding, of what vast impor∣tance is it, that when a friend to Jesus seeks a wife or husband, that they seek one that loves God; one that appears a friend to religion, one that loves their Je∣sus; one that loves to converse about spiritual things; one that can sympathize with them in their joys and sorrows; be a partner of their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and
<PB N="10" REF="043980_0009_101DADC621D8FE48"/>woes in a proper sense: How should they look to Jesus for direction that they may have such an one.</P>
<P>You that are friends to Jesus, if you do not seek such for your partner, when your marriage day comes you will differ about about your guests. The bridegroom desires to invite Jesus— the bride does not love to (so <HI>vice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersa</HI>) so your dif∣ference seems to begin before the marriage day. But how can you take one for your nearest and dearest friend, that doth not appear to love Jesus; "for whom you have suffered the loss of all things, and counted it but dung, that you might win Christ. Phil. iii. 8." You know Christ tells you, "he that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. He that loveth wife or children more than me is not worthy of me," &amp;c. Matt. x, 37. Luke xiv, 26. A person must forsake all, that intends to win heaven; therefore it seems necessary in the na∣ture and reason of things, as well as from the scrip∣tures, that a friend to Jesus should not marry with one that appears to be an enemy to him, or in other words with an open immoral profane person, "For how can two walk together except they be agreed." There is no person that is not a friend in heart to Je∣sus, ever desires his presence at their wedding. They do not desire that rejoicing he recommends, they do not like that meriment. Luke xv. 24, "And they began to be merry." No, they had rather have car∣nal mirth, they had rather not have Jesus there. Therefore, it is of the greatest importance, when a lover of God seeks a partner, to look to God for di∣rection and so marry in the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="043980_0010_101DADC927063048"/>
3. I would turn the address to the married in this assembly. Is marriage an ordinance of God. Is it emblematical of Christ and his church, as we have shewn; yes, surely it is, "marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, but whore-mongers and adulterers God will judge." Then how should mar∣ried people live together and not profane that sacred ordinance. How should husbands and wives live together in love and harmony, and be helps meet to one another, not only as to living in this world, but helps to each other in their Christian race towards the heavenly Canaan. They should so live as to be a lively emblem of Christ and his church.</P>
<P>How much depends upon the example of parents with regard to their children. Example is more than precept. God is wont to bless the good examples and pious instruction of parents to their children. Saith God I know Abraham, he will command his chil∣dren and houshold after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord.</P>
<P>Says Joshua, "As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</P>
<P>O then let parents be exhorted to walk before their houses with a perfect heart, and live together as heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindered.</P>
<P N="4">4thly and lastly, I shall turn the address to the whole assembly. Is it as we have heard, that per∣sons must become friendly to Jesus in order to have his presence with them at the ordinance of marriage. It is so in this ordinance and all others, of what ne∣cessity
<PB N="12" REF="043980_0011_101DA2224A749AF0"/>then that all become friendly to Christ, that they be married to him. Without this no duty is acceptable to him; no duty done as God requires without this; no promise of life being comfortable in this world. No promise of future well being.</P>
<P>From these motives let me exhort all to wed with the Lord Jesus, to marry to him; consider he is now courting a bride; he is offering to be married to sinners; his voice is, Behold I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, all things are ready, come unto the marriage. Matt. xxii. 4.</P>
<P>So Proverbs ix. begins, Wisdom has builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars, she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine, she hath also furnished her table; she hath sent forth her maidens; she crieth upon the high places of the city, whoso is simple let him turn in hither, as for him that wanteth under∣standing, she saith to him, come eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mingled, forsake the foolish and live, and go in the way of understanding.</P>
<P>Jesus has every charming voice, and charming sound, and charming invitation, to invite sinners to come and marry to him Rev. i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 20. Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice and will open the door, I will come in and sop with him and he with me. Again, Rev. xxii. 17. The Spirit and the bride, say, Come And let him that heareth, say, Come. And let him that is a thirst come: And whosoever will, let him take of the wa¦ters of life freely—Jesus invites sinners to come one
<PB N="13" REF="043980_0012_101DADCF1AC33A10"/>marry to him, however poor, and wretched, and mi∣serable they be; he will not reject them, if they come in sincerity and truth. Rev. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider there is every thing in Jesus to induce a person, in his right mind, to come and embrace him, to wed with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We love, when we marry, to marry those that are rich; if we desire this quali∣fication, this is in the Lord Jesus Christ to perfecti∣on—Riches and honor are with me, even durable riches and righteousness. Prov. viii. 18. so l. 10, and on. Jesus has every thing to give the poor naked sinners, that will come and marry to him; he has gold tried in the sire, he has white raimant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—If they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> food or raiment, there is plenty with Jesus; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and milk to be had without money and without price; there is delicious fair with him, they may eat angels meat.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we marry we desire a person that is beautiful, if this may be any motive, there is all beauty in Jesus; all the beauty in heaven and in earth, is summed up in him, "He is the brightness of the Father's glory, and express image of his person, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne is whom all fulness dwells."</P>
<P>What says the spouse, when trying to describe his beauty, beginning with his features, but for want of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds closeth— "Yea he is altogether lovely."</P>
<P N="3">3. We chuse the person we marry to, to be kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> loving; we love a kind husband a kind wife <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever such kindness and love shown by any hus¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wife, as Jesus shews to those that mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is kind at all times; a friend at all times
