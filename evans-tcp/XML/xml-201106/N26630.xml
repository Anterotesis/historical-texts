<L>LORD when my wretched soul surveys</L>
<L>The various follies of my ways,</L>
<L>Well may I tremble to appear,</L>
<L>Laden with horror shame and fear.</L>
<L>Adam, our common head, alas,</L>
<L>brought sin and death on all our race;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From him my ruin'd nature came, Heir to his sorrow, and his shame.</L>
<L>My body weak, and dark my mind, To good averse, to sin inclin'd:</L>

<L>Vainly I seek to plead a word,</L>
<L>Silent in guilt before the Lord.</L>

<L>And yet his frowns, and ven∣geance too, I by my sins have made my due.</L>
<L>Is there no hope! and must I die! Is there no friend, nor helper nigh!</L>
<L>Is it beyond repeal decreed, That every soul that sins must bleed!</L>
<L>O let my longing trembling ear, Some sound of grace and pardon hear, My soul would the first news embrace, And turn its tremblings into praise.</L>

<L>Jesus, his only Son, displays The wonders of his Father's grace;</L>
<L>By the blest message brought from heaven, Pardon and peace to men are given.</L>

<L>JESUS! how bright his glo∣ries shine! The great Emman∣uel is divine.</L>
<L>Yet he to bring salvation down</L>
<L>Had put our mortal nature on.</L>
<L>He in a humble virgin's womb</L>
<L>A feeble infant did become:</L>
<L>A stable was his logding made</L>
<L>And the rude manger was his bed.</L>
<L>Growing in life he still was seen, Humble, labourious, poor and mean.</L>
<L>The Son of God, from year to year, Did as a carpenter ap∣pear.</L>

<L>CHRIST labor'd with un∣wearied zeal, God's will and nature to reveal.</L>
<L>To prove the heavenly truths he taught, Unnumbered mira∣cles he wrought.</L>
<L>Through all his life his doc∣trine shines, Drawn in the plainest, fairest lines:</L>
<L>And death at length did he sustain, Our pardon and our peace to gain.</L>
<L>All honour then ascribed be, to him who liv'd and died for me.</L>

<L>JESUS the righteous! lo, he dies, For sin a spotless sac∣rifice;</L>
<L>Justice has on his sacred head, The weight of our trans∣gressions laid.</L>
<L>If God's own Son would sinners save, He must be hum∣bled to the grave;</L>
<L>That so a pardoning God might shew, What vengeance to our crimes was due.</L>
<L>Cold in the tomb that mournful day, My Saviour's mangled body lay.</L>

<L>NOW, O my soul, thy grief refrain, Jesus the Saviour lives again.</L>
<L>On the third day the con∣queror rose, And greatly tri∣umph'd o'er his foes.</L>
<L>Exalted on a shining throne, At God's right hand he sits him down.</L>
<L>To plead the merits of his blood, And rule for all his people's good.</L>
<L>Wide o're all worlds his power extends, And well can he protect his friends.</L>
<L>May I in that blest band ap∣pear, Secure from danger and from sear.</L>

<L>THEY must repent, and must believe, Who Christ's salvation would receive.</L>
<L>O may thy spirit faith im∣part, And work repentance in my heart.</L>
<L>The sins and follies I have done, Humbled in dust I would bemoan;</L>
<L>And while past guilt I thus deplore, I would repeat that guilt no more.</L>
<L>So shall thy grace my sins forgive, Jesus shall smile, and I shall live.</L>

<L>'TIS not in my weak power alone, To melt this stubborn heart of stone,</L>
<L>My soul to change, my life to mend, Or seek to Christ, that gen'rous friend.</L>
<L>'Tis God's own Spirit from above, Fixes our faith, in∣flames our love,</L>

<L>I'll seek it in a Saviour's name, Who will not turn my hopes to shame.</L>

<L>WHAT kind provision God has made, That we may safe to heaven be led!</L>
<L>For this the prophets preach'd and wrote, For this the blest apostles taught.</L>
<L>For this he churches did or∣dain, His truths and worship to maintain;</L>
<L>For this he pastors did provide, In those assemblies to preside.</L>
<L>He from the round of com∣mon days, Mark'd out our sab∣baths to his praise.</L>
<L>Delightful day, when christ∣ians meet, To hear, and pray, and sing, how sweet!</L>

<L>In baptism wash'd we all must be, In honour of the sac∣red Three,</L>
<L>To shew how we are wash'd from sin, And born again by grace divine.</L>
<L>For God the Father, and the Son, And Holy Spirit, three in one,</L>
<L>Glorious beyond all speech and thought, Have jointly my salvation wrought.</L>
<L>Into these names was I bap∣tiz'd, And be the honour justly priz'd: I'll join then in my songs of praise, Now, and thro' heaven's eternal days.</L>

<L>THE mem'ry of Christ's death is sweet, When saints around his table meet,</L>
<L>And break the bread, and pour the wine, Obedient to his word divine.</L>
<L>As they the bread and cup receive, So whilst on Christ their souls believe,</L>
<L>They eat his flesh, they drink his blood, Cordial divine, and heavenly food.</L>
<L>Well may their souls rejoice and thrive, O may the blessed hour arrive,</L>
<L>When ripe in knowledge and in grace, I at that board shall find a place.</L>

<L>To distant worlds, and seats unknown, My naked spirit must be gone:</L>
<L>To God its maker must return, And ever joy, or ever mourn.</L>
<L>Awake, my soul, without delay, That if God summons thee this day.</L>
<L>Thou cheerful at his call may rise, And spring to life beyond the skies.</L>

<L>O be thy shield around me spead, To guard the spirit thou hast made.</L>
<L>Save me from snares of earth and hell, And from myself pre∣serve me well;</L>
<L>Lest all the heavenly truths I know, Increase my guilt, and shame, and woe.</L>
