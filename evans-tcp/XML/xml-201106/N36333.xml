<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO SEAMEN; WITH <HI>DIRECTIONS</HI> FOR A <HI>MEDICINE CHEST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEAFARING people are that class of mankind who are supposed to be in perfect health when they en∣rol themselves for any particular voyage or cruise; not∣withstanding their hardiness, they are liable to many and numerous excruciating maladies, during the prose∣cution of their respective voyages to different parts of the world: Whatever, therefore has a tendency to meliorate, or render comfortable the situation of the sick on board of vessels, must be an acquisition truly important and useful to all navigators. I shall there∣fore, by way of preface to the directions for a sea medicine chest, offer some general outlines on the ap∣pearance and management of the principal diseases which occur to seamen in different voyages and places. It has been a common practice to put up medicine chests, with directions containing the doses and virtues
<PB REF="047482_0003_1023B4ABB9BD6EE0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> article only. This cannot be of much service to the people, unless the master or prescriber has a pre∣vious knowledge of diseases, or is a person of judgment sufficient to discern the character of the disease, and thereby judge what particular indication is best suited remove it.</P>
<P>Many sick people at sea have suffered much, and had their complaint prolonged, in consequence of a too frequent, and often opposite repetition of medicines; this is in consequence of the similarity there is in the symptoms of many diseases, which in their respective natures, are diametrically opposite, and which, without some general rule or guide, no man can make a neces∣sary distinction. The short system which I here pre∣sent, will be brief and concise; at the same time con∣taining an illustration of circumstances, necessary to mark the general characteristic, on which most of the diseases incident to seamen, depend. Whereby the master may know on what grounds to prescribe his me∣dicines, and how he may judge of their effects, and con∣duct his applications through all the variety of symp∣toms that occur, in general diseases.</P>
<P>Sailors are very apt to be careless of their health, especially while in port, and expose themselves to every intemperance that can possibly produce the occasional causes of diseases. It is therefore incumbent on the master to watch his people closely, while under his care; and when sick, to make faithful investigation respecting their conduct and habits, during a number of days before the arrival of the disease.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ALL GENERAL DISEASES ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR ORDERS,</HI> viz:— FEVERS, INFLAMMATIONS, FLUXES, AND DISEASES OF WEAKNESS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>ORDER I. <HI>FEVERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FEVERS, comprehend all those diseases which are attended with the following symptoms: viz. the patient complains first of a dull pain in the back and limbs, weakness of the joints, especially of the knees, a heavy pain, load, and disagreeable sensations at the stomach, with a natural aversion to move about or exercise; a yawning, stretching, &amp;c. succeeded by slight cold chills, flying through the body, head ach, sickness at the stomach, the eye looks dull and heavy, sometimes very red and prominent, as the cold chill advances the skin is pale and shrivelled; these symptoms are next succeeded by heats throughout the body, with the ap∣pearance of enlarged veins, quick, hard and laborious pulse, striking from 70 to 100 strokes in a minute,
<PB N="6" REF="047482_0005_1023B4B0DAC3EDC0"/>
sometimes the pulse feels small, quick and trembling; sickness at the stomach, sometimes occasions violent vo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and sometimes purgings; the patient is uneasy and restless, but complains of no particular pain except in the head, which sometimes occasions deliriums, a wildness, and incoherent speaking, pulling and hauling the bed cloaths, &amp;c. These symptoms continue 6 or 8 hours, when they abate a little, but return again to∣wards night with their former violence, and continue to observe these periods until the 9th, 11th, 14th, and sometimes run on to the 20th and 24th day of the dis∣ease, before a solution terminates either in death or health. These different periods of the disease vary ac∣cording to the climate, state of the patient's constitu∣tion, nature of the reigning diseases of the place, and a variety of circumstances which often shorten or lengthen a fever: It is to be observed that different people with different constitutions will be differently affected with the same fever. Some are attacked with all the above mentioned symptoms, with violent vomitings of black matter, and bleeding at the nose, eyes and gums; others with the same fever, in the same place and vessel, have all those symptoms mild, and a very clear head, with quiet stomach and bowels; others again are seized with violent heat and pains in the head and bones, and con∣tinue in the greatest tortures two or three days, and die sudden. These last circumstances depend on the man∣ner of living; to frequent intoxication, and being late out in night air fogs, lying on deck evenings; carousing in hot, close houses, and suddenly going into the air; the nature of the prevailing sickness in port; being in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, still rivers, canals, marshy places, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>These are the general marks of contagious and epi∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>al fevers, which sweep off so many of our Amer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but seamen are liable to fevers from different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as sudden colds, with obstructed per∣spiration;
<PB REF="047482_0006_1023B4B2608B0630"/>
from a foul and weakened stomach, bad provisions, &amp;c. &amp;c. and many get fevers from their own carelessness or negligence, as has been before mentioned; but they are all cured much in the same manner; va∣rying the modes in proportion to the violent symptoms of the fever present.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having examined the patient's constitution, his habits of living, and the state of his stomach and bowels; and whether those symptoms mentioned above, are actually present, the judgment will dictate what particular evacuation will be most proper. If the sick∣ness at stomach, with vomiting of bile, is the most pre∣valent, it will be proper to give a vomit, No. 1. and after the operation is finished, if the heat, thirst, quick pulse, and symptoms of fever continue to rage, blood letting must be had recourse to, drawn freely, and re∣peated as the symptoms require, having regard to the robust habit of the patient, &amp;c. It is to be remem∣bered, that we cannot be too free with the lancet in many climates, especially in the West-Indies, and in our southern states, among the fevers incident to those cli∣mates; after bleeding, a purge, No. 3. is to be given, and should it not operate largely, it must be repeated again. These three general evacuations are only to be depended upon in the cure of fevers, and must be re∣peated as the symptoms of fever and violence of the complaint indicate. For drink, the fever julep, No. 18. may be taken often, by mixing it with water, barley tea cold, beverage, lemonade water, or fifteen or twenty drops of No. 10. mixed with a pint of water, may be
<PB N="8" REF="047482_0007_1023B4B4F34C1C50"/>
a drink constantly, and is very proper in hot climates, where putrefaction is to be dreaded; crem. Tartar water, &amp;c. The patient must be kept cool, and suffered to breathe pure air.</P>
<P>If notwithstanding the exhibition of these general indications of <HI>vomiting, bleeding, purging,</HI> and <HI>cooling,</HI> the fever should run on till it terminates in a putrid, dissolved state of the blood, which is known by an abate∣ment of all pains or uneasiness; a black, dry tongue, with a yellow streak across the middle of it; stinking breath, and weakening, clammy sweats, hollow eyes, blood starting from the gums, nose, bowels, and the recovery of his senses, you must lay aside all those cool∣ing medicines, and give freely of No. 4. No. 11. brandy, wine, and wash the patient freely in good spirits and vinegar, keeping his cabin well ventilated, &amp;c. But in this stage of the business it will be proper to have the advice of a physician.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>ORDER II. <HI>INFLAMMATIONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UNDER this head are <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> inflam∣mations: The internal are <HI>plenrisy, quinsey, rheumatism, gout,</HI> inflammation of the <HI>stomach, bowels, kidnies,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. They are attended with the above symptoms of fever, heat, quick and strong pulse; with a particular seated severe pain in those parts, where the disorder fixes; at the side in <HI>pleurisy, throat</HI> in <HI>quinsies,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. All internal inflammations attended with fever, proceed from great and sudden colds, exposure to damp air when
<PB N="9" REF="047482_0008_1023B4B6AB8AF130"/>
sweated, and also drinking largely of cold water when warm, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>External inflammations are painful swellings, with redness of the part, tending to encrease to large tumors, and suppuration.</P>
<P>Internal inflammations are cured by blood-letting, purging with salts, No. 2. and powder, No. 3. drink∣ing freely of barley and flaxseed tea, crem. Tartar water, &amp;c.</P>
<P>External inflammations are cured by applying the mineral water, No. 16. and purging with salts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> powder, No. 3. bleeding, and if the swelling is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and increases to maturate, poultices of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bread and milk, must be applied warm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> repeated, till it is fit to be opened with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>ORDER III. <HI>FLUXES,</HI> Such as <HI>Dysentery, Cholera Morbus, Diarrhaea,</HI> or common Looseness, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DYSENTERY or <HI>bloody flux,</HI> is cured by bleeding, if feverish, purging with salts, No. 2. sometimes taking a vomit, if sick at the stomach; drinking freely of barley tea; after the bowels are emptied, take twenty-five or thirty drops of No. 5. every night, and drink barley and toasted bread made into paste, with rice plentifully salted.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="047482_0009_1023B4B9327294D0"/><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> morbus</HI> is cured by immediately taking large draughts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> broth, and clysters of the same; sometimes it will be proper to give a vomit, No. 1. and if the vomiting and purging still continue, give thirty or forty drops of No. 5.</P>
<P>A common looseness is often very salutary, therefore should never be stopped too suddenly; it may be cured by taking warm burnt brandy, with eighteen or twenty drops of No. 5. at going to bed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>ORDER IV. <HI>DISEASES</HI> OF <HI>WEAKNESS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH they do not frequently occur at sea, yet many times seamen are liable to lingering diseases, which require some of the master's skill; such as <HI>scurvy, dropsical swellings, intermitting fevers, colics, rheuma∣tisms</HI> without fever, <HI>jaundice,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Scurvy</HI> is cured by taking ten or fourteen drops of No. 10. in water, three times a day, eating fruit vege∣tables, drinking lemonade, and if there are any scurvy sores, and spongy, they must be cut out with a lancet, and dressed with line, and salve, No. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Dropsical swellings</HI> are cured by friction, taking bark, brandy, wine, and nourishing diet; gentle ex∣ercise, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Intermitting fever,</HI> commonly called fever and ague, is cured by taking a vomit, No. 1. and when the fever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off, a tea spoonful of bark every two hours, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="047482_0010_1023B4BCB717C668"/><HI>Colics</HI> are cured by taking clyster<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, purging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, No. 3. fomenting the belly with flannels wrung out of boiling water, and applied warm to the belly.</P>
<P><HI>Jaundice</HI> is cured by purging with No. 3. taking a pill of Castile soap two or three times a day; exercise; good diet, bitters, No. 11. bark, No. 4. brandy, wine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sudden maladies, as convulsion fits, suppression of the urine, &amp;c. often occur at sea; the former requires thirty or forty drops of No. 5. every hour till relief; the latter, fomenting the belly and bladder, as in colic, drinking flaxseed tea, crem. Tartar water, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Wounds;</HI> such as cuts and bruises, are to be treated with some considerable care: If an important part is cut deep, and large blood vessels are separated, the bleeding must be stopped by compressing the edges of the wound together, filling it with lint, and if it bleeds much, cover it with lint and flour, and compress it close, letting the lint and flour remain on till the parts are united: It is best to sew up an incised wound, when it can be done.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>VENEREAL DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>A SIMPLE gonorrhoea or running, without any taint in the blood, may be cured by taking a powder, No. 3. every other morning, till the patient has taken three; by injecting sweet oil into the yard two or three times a day; this is highly recommended.</P>
<P>When the virus of the disease has entered the blood,
<PB N="12" REF="047482_0011_1023B4BE4AC6BA60"/>
and occasioned scaldings, swellings, pains, &amp;c. &amp;c. then the general cure is to be attempted: Let the patient first be purged two or three times with salts, and pur∣ging powders, No. 3. then begin and take a table spoonful of No. 14. morning and evening. Let his diet be rather spare, and to eat no salted or greasy pro∣visions; drink brandy and gin only; and purge every fourth day till he is well, &amp;c. Buboes, or swellings in the groin, must be carried away in their beginning, if possible; rub on them at going to bed, the ointment, No. 8. taking care not to get any cold, &amp;c.</P>
