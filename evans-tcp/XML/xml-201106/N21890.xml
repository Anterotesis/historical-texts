<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor flatters himself that this abstract of the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> will not be unworthy the ac∣ceptance and patronage of his fellow-citizens. The importance of having our children taught so useful a branch of knowledge, is too obvious to need his feeble recommendation: for 'twill be universally acknowledged, that the mind takes a turn in future life, suitable to the tincture it hath re∣ceived in youth; I will naturally conclude, that there is not a necessity to regard, or at least to lay any stress
<PB N="vi" REF="028831_0003_0FDE28B28094D1A8"/>
upon what was never inculcated up∣on it as a matter of importance then: and so will grow up in a total ne∣glect or disesteem of those studies ne∣cessary to form the wise and truly un∣derstanding man.</P>
<P>Conceiving it therefore a matter of great importance to each individual as an inhabitant of any country, that he or she hath a knowledge of the history thereof; and being well per∣suaded, that the following is well adapted to the youthful mind, hath excited the present attempt.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>AMERICA, the western conti∣nent, is situated between 35 and 145 degrees of western longitude, and between 80 north, and 58 south lati∣tude: bounded by the lands and seas about the Artic pole on the north; by the Atlantic ocean on the east; by the vast Southern ocean on the south; and by the Pacific ocean which divides it
<PB N="9" REF="028831_0004_0FDE28B6B5262F98"/>
from Asia, on the west. Its comput∣ed length, from north to south, is nine thousand miles, and three thousand miles in breadth.</P>
<P>It is not an improbable conjecture to suppose this country was first peo∣pled by the Carthtganians, who were situate on the north-west coast of Afri∣ca, and possessed several islands in the Atlantic ocean, where they frequently sent thousands of men, women, and chil∣dren. It is certainly natural to expect that some of their ships, which were very large, might miss those islands, and be driven to the west, beyond their intend∣ed port; and if this ever happened, they must have been carried to America, which is but three weeks sail from the Canary or Cape de Verd islands, from whence it was impossible they should return to the Eastern continent, as the trade winds always set against them, and the use of the compass was not known in those early ages. Thus this exten∣sive
<PB N="10" REF="028831_0005_0FDE28BBD3EF0700"/>
country, and its valuable produc∣tions remained unknown to the more enlightened parts of the world, until Christopher Columbus, a native of Ge∣noa, suggested the idea that there was another continent beyond the Atlan∣tic ocean. But however sanguine Co∣lumbus might be in his expectations, it appears that his proposals for carrying his bold schemes into execution was treated with cool indifference by the different courts he applied to: and it was not until the expiration of several years close application, that he was to proceed on his voyage. At length the court of Spain began to listen more favourably to the proposed undertaking, and Columbus was commissioned to equip three ships with the title of admiral of the western seas: with these ships he set sail from Palos in Andalusia the 3d of August A. D. 1492, and arrived at the Canary islands on the 12th; from thence he sail∣ed, September 1st, to the westward, but
<PB N="11" REF="028831_0005_0FDE28BBD3EF0700"/>
his men began to mutiny, before they had been out fourteen days, imagin∣ing he was leading them to certain de∣struction; he notwithstanding persuad∣ed them to continue the voyage until the 16th, at which time they were con∣sulting to throw their admiral overboard and return to their own country, but he had the good fortune at ten o'clock the same night to see a light on shore, and the next day made land which proved to be one of the Bahama islands: from thence he sailed to Cuba and Hispaniola, and from thence back to Europe, having performed his voyage to the new world and back again in seven months and eleven days, and was received by the court of Spain with all the honours due to a man that had found out another continent; yet how unstable is the fa∣vour of princes: this deserving man af∣ter bringing such a large acquisition to the crown of Spain as astonished Eu∣rope, was superceded in his government
<PB N="12" REF="028831_0006_0FDE28C124102998"/>
in the new world, and sent home in chains, after he had made his third voyage in quality of viceroy, of the country he had discovered, and died poor. They however were so grateful to his memory that the court of Spain ordered his remains a magnificent burial in the cathedral of Seville, and over his tomb was this inscription:</P>
<P><Q>Columbus has given a new world to the kingdoms of Castile and Leon.</Q></P>

AMERICUS VESPUTIUS, a Floren∣tine, was sent by the court of Spain to make further discoveries, A. D. 1497; and having made the Canaries, sailed from thence south-west 1000 leagues, and arrived at the Carribe islands in 16 degrees north latitude, and continuing his course 900 leagues further, west, arrived at a country under the tropic of cancer, supposed to be some part of Mex∣ico. In the next year, 1498, he made another voyage, and sailing from Spain south-west, passed the equator and came to Brazil, 5 degrees south latitude. In the year 1501, we find him engaged in the service of Emanuel, king of Portu∣gal, who fitted out three ships for an expedition to the new world, and after touching at Brazil, and sailing 52 de∣grees south latitude along the coast, re∣turned. From him the vast and exten∣sive continent of America took its name. Thus Columbus was robbed of the ho∣nour due to his extensive genius and
<PB N="15" REF="028831_0007_0FDE28C4AC5931F8"/>
justly acquired fame. After him there were several other adventurists employ∣ed by the different courts of Europe; as Sebastian Cabbot, of Italian extraction, who was employed by Henry the seventh of England, to find out a north-west passage to China, he departed from En∣gland, 1498, and sailed along the north-east coast of America to 67 degrees north latitude, but failed in his attempt. The English, nevertheless, were benefitted by the voyage as they claimed a large tract of country in consequence of the discoveries made by Cabbot, and was called British America, which was di∣vided into colonies: of these we shall treat separately, under the title of the United Independent States of North America.</P>

NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND is bounded by Ca∣nada on the north, by the Atlantic ocean and Nova-Scotia on the east and south, and by New York on the west. It is divided into four governments or states, viz. New Hampshire, Massachusetts Rhode-Island and Connecticut.</P>
<P>The land next the sea in New Eng∣land is generally low, but farther up the country it rises into hills, and on the north-east it is rocky and mountaneous. The north-west wind blowing over a long tract of frozen country makes the winters excessive cold; the climate in general healthful and agreeable to Eu∣ropean constitutions. Fruit comes to great perfection, particularly peaches, it is not very uncommon to find seven or eight hundred peaches on one tree, and seven barrels of cyder has been made from one apple tree.</P>
<P>English wheat, it is said, does not
<PB N="18" REF="028831_0009_0FDE28CEEE18B860"/>
thrive here; but Indian corn will fre∣quently produce from one grain two thousand. Ship building is a considera∣ble employment in this country. The spermaceti whale, and other whales are found on the coast, of which the New-England people take great numbers. This country was first settled from En∣gland. In the year 1619, some zea∣lous dissenters of the independent per∣suasion, uneasy at being required to conform to the church of England, pur∣chases what was called the Plymouth patent, and obtained another from king James; a number of adventurers, to the amount of 150, embarked in a ship, at Plymouth, which sailed the 6th of Sep∣tember, A. D. 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in New-England, the ninth of November following, where they built a town and called it New Plymouth; and Mr. John Carver was elected their first governor. The Indians at this time were so engaged in wars amongst them∣selves
<PB N="19" REF="028831_0009_0FDE28CEEE18B860"/>
that these strangers were suffered to remain pretty quiet, and they having learned from one Quanto, an Indian, who had been to England, what a powerful people the English were. This induced many of the sachems the following spring to seek an alliance with them, professing themselves subjects to the crown of En∣gland. More ships arriving with plan∣ters and provisions, a colony soon became established, but differences arising on account of religion had like to have been of fatal consequence. The indepen∣dents, who were the most numerous, re∣fusing to tolerate any other sect or per∣suasion but their own. Several of the adventurers removed to other parts of the country and others returned home; thus the colony became so weakened that had it not been for the civil war that kept the Indians employed, they would in all probability have been dri∣ven out of the country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of New England
<PB N="20" REF="028831_0010_0FDE28D46C46B780"/>
were early distinguished for an ardent love of liberty, and thereby became ob∣noxious to British power, especially in the beginning of the late revolution; wherein they sustained with firmness the first shocks of an enraged and powerful nation, until they were supported by the whole force of the sister provinces; now called the United Independent States of North America: when after a struggle for their natural and political rights for several years, with their mother coun∣try they at last shook off the British yoke and established on the broad basis of liberty that constitution which is at once the envy and admiration of Europe. Dr. Benjamin Franklin, a native of New England, universally admired for his philosophical and political talents had a large share of the public confidence in the beginning of the dispute, and on him in a great measure depended the success of an opposition which in the beginning promised little to the opposers, and till

MASSACHUSETTS.</HEAD>
<P>MASSACHUSETTS still preserves its original Indian name, from Massassoit the native prince found on the spot by the first adventurers from England, with whom they entered into alliance, offensive and defensive: they then pro∣ceeded to build a town which they call∣ed New Plymouth, and made Mr. John Carver their first governor, A. D. 1620. This infant colony was made unhappy by disagreements on the score of religion, which was carried to so great a length that those in power actually put several to death for not conforming to their way of worship, until king Charles the second put a stop to the sanguinary measures of the court of Boston, in the year 1650, and during the administra∣tion of John Endicot, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> a furious independent.</P>

spirit, but are universally respected for the mildness of their laws and equal distribution of justice; and happy would it be, if those in power throughout the United States, were equally solicitous to check immorality of every kind. About the year 1627, another set of ad∣venturers purchased a grant of the Ply∣mouth company, and fitted out six ships with 300 planters; they also procured a grant of king Charles, and nominated Mr. Craddock their first governor: this company arriving on the coast with live cattle and other stores proper for a set∣tlement, built the town of Salem, be∣tween the promontaries of Marblehead and cape Anne. Craddock refusing to go over with these planters they chose John Winthrop, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> their governor, and in 1630 built Boston as before men∣tioned, on Massachusetts bay. These people inherited a love of liberty from their forefathers who had suffered much for their principles in old England, and
<PB N="24" REF="028831_0012_0FDE28DFD5839568"/>
sought in a wilderness that freedom which was denied them in the mother country. As they grew in power, they carefully watched over and guarded against the encroachments of the British govern∣ment, and afterwards sought, with dis∣tinguished fortitude, a redress of griev∣ances; thus keeping alive the spirit of opposition, they paved the way for the rest of the colonies, to come forward and join them in a united struggle against the unlawful claims of a country, whose chains had sorely galled them for many years: till finally the grand and asto∣nishing stroke was struck which de∣molished the power of Great Britain, over the colonies, and left them in pos∣session of an envied sovereignty; as in∣dependent states, likely one day to be∣come respectable and dreaded by all Eu∣rope, for their opulence and power. Yet it must be acknowledged, that much depends on wise legislation, and a free and equal distribution of law and

justice. Boston is the capital of this state, and makes at this time a consider∣able figure in the union; and sends fourteen members to congress.</P>

CONNECTICUT.</HEAD>
<P>CONECTICUT, bounded by the state of Massachussetts, was granted by king Charles to the Earl or Warwick, in 1630, who conveyed his right to Wil∣liam, lord viscount, Say and Seal, Robert lord Brook, Sir Nathanial Rich, Charles Finnes, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> John Pym, and John Hampden, <ABBR>esqs</ABBR> gentlemen, at that time disaffected to the government, who designed to transport themselves with the chief of their party to that colony, in case they had not succeeded in their op∣position to king Charles, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ap∣pears they had their doubts; for it is strongly insisted upon that Oliver Cromwell, Sir Arthur Aslerig, John Hampden and several more were on the point of leaving their native country but were prevented by a proclamation pub∣lished in 1637, which prohibited people from transporting themselves without license, and these afterwards prevailing

against king Charles, sold their right in the country to others, who embarking and bringing over with them great num∣bers of their countrymen, the New-England provinces were planted and well peopled within the space of twenty years, during which time they were ve∣ry little troubled by the Indians. But the inhabitants of Connecticut beginning to erect fortresses, and extend their im∣provements to the westward, without leave of the natives, the Indians began to be alarmed, apprehending they should in time be dispossessed of their country, and finally be enslaved by these foreign∣ers. King Philip, alias Metacomet, son of Massassoit, who first entered into an alliance with the English, observing the danger his country was in, and that the English no longer treated with that for∣bearance and kindness they formerly were accustomed to, but, on the contra∣ry, tyrannized over his people, and in a manner deprived him of his authority;
<PB N="29" REF="028831_0014_0FDE28E9C28A6400"/>
sent messengers to all the tribes of the neighbouring Indian nations, strongly stimulating them to take up arms in the defence of their country; which, having its designed effect they united and be∣came formidable enemies to the new set∣tlers, and gained advantages in several engagements; but king Philip, the soul of the undertaking, being killed by a musket shot, the English at last pre∣vailed, and great numbers of the Indians were massacred, others were driven out of the country, and joined the French in Canada, who granting them protection they still had it in their power to disturb the frontier settlements, until all Cana∣da was ceded to the crown of Great Bri∣tain by France, ratified at Paris, March 10th, 1763.

NEW-HAMPSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>NEW-HAMPSHIRE, bounded by the former described states, was divided off to another set of adventurers; these ar∣rived about the same time that the pro∣vince or state of Connecticut was settled.

It is divided W. N. W. by Connecticut river from the state of Vermont. Ports∣mouth is the capital town. Some part of this state is mountaineous. The white

The height of these mountains is fifty-five thousand feet; the foot of the mountain is thirty-five hundred feet from the level of the sea. The snow and ice cover them for nine or ten months in the year. The air is serene and health∣ful, and not so subject to change as in the more southern states.

STATE OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY HUDSON, an Englishman, in the year 1608, under a commission from the king, discovered Long Island, New-York, and the river which still bears his name, and afterwards sold his right to the Dutch. The Dutch writers contend that he was sent out by their East India company in 1609 to discover a north-west passage to China, and hav∣ing first discovered Delaware bay, he came hither, and sailed up Hudson river as far north as the latitude 43 degrees. It however appears that the English ob∣jected to the sale, though they for some∣time neglected to oppose the Dutch set∣tlement of the country. In 1610, Hud∣son sailed again from the coast of Hol∣land to this country, called by the Dutch, New Netherlands; and four years afterwards the states general granted a patent to sundry merchants for an exclusive trade on the north river,
<PB N="35" REF="028831_0017_0FDE28F7C617C0E0"/>
who in 1614, built a fort on the west side. Captain Argal, returning from an expedition against the French, on the bay of Funday; commissioned by sir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, paid a visit to the Dutch on Hudson ri∣ver, who, unable to resist him, prudently submitted for the present to the king of England, and under him to the gover∣nor of Virginia; but the next year they built a fort on the south-west side of the island then called Manhattans, now York Island. In 1621, the states ge∣neral determined upon the settlement of the country, made a grant of it to their West India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Amsterdam, now New-York, and took upon him∣self the government, in June, 1621, his style in the patents granted by him was thus, "We director and council resid∣ing in New Netherlands, under the go∣vernment of their high mightinesses, the lords states general of the Uunited Ne¦therlands,
<PB N="36" REF="028831_0018_0FDE28FCF1B981E8"/>
&amp;c." The Dutch, after ma∣ny unsuccessful struggles to keep pos∣session of the country, at last, gave up their claims at the peace concluded in 1674. The state of New-York con∣tains, Long Island, Staten Island, and the lands on the east side of Hudson ri∣ver, to the bounds of Connecticut from the division line, between that state and Massachusetts bay, northward to the line of the state of Vermont, &amp;c. The city of New-York is built on an island, called by the Indians Manhattans: the island is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about fourteen miles in length; the South-west point pro∣jects into a fine spacious bay and opens the ocean to full view. The passage up to New-York from Sandy-Hook is safe, and not above twenty-five miles in length. The city has in reality no na∣tural bason or harbour. The ships lie off in the road, on the east end of the town; the streets are irregular and pav∣ed
<PB N="37" REF="028831_0018_0FDE28FCF1B981E8"/>
with pebbles. It remains to be a place of considerable trade, and was long the rival of Philadelphia, the capital of Pennsylvania; but the last has the as∣cendency of all the sea port towns on the continent, both as to commerce and op∣pulence. There is perhaps the best fish market at New-York, but the streets and buildings when contrasted with Philadelphia suffers much in the com∣parison. The state is divided into coun∣ties, viz. Albany, Kings, Queens, Suf∣folk, Richmond, West-Chester, Ulstar, Dutches and Orange.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this state are ge∣nerally healthy and robust, breathing a free and serene air; they are sprightly in their tempers, and instances of suicide are rarely seen amongst them. New-York state sends ten members to con∣gress.</P>

STATE OF VERMONT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS state, the least populous of any on the continent, and formed into a se∣parate state since the declaration and es∣tablishment of independence, is, never∣theless, likely one day to become a va∣luable acquisition; is bounded by the British line in Canada, northerly; by New-Hampshire and the other eastern states. As it lies open to incursions of the Indians, aided by the British, the settlement on the frontiers will probably improve but slowly; there is, neverthe∣less, a fine tract of land within this state, improving fast, and husbandmen remov∣ing yearly from the neighbouring states. The soil is in many places rich, and af∣fords good wheat, rice, &amp;c. The capi∣tal town is Bennington: sends two members to congress.</P>

common to the continent. A par∣ticular description of those of one state will answer for all the states of the Uni∣on, with very small exceptions. The fur trade is carried on in this state in time of peace, with the Indians, who, could they be persuaded to put that con∣fidence in the Americans, which they have hitherto placed in the British, would prove a source of wealth to the inhabitants, by drawing the fur trade into the state, and bartering for the skins and peltry, the produce of the country, with the natives.</P>

STATE OF NEW-JERSEY.</HEAD>
<P>NEW-JERSY, east and west, were formerly proprietary governments, but the proprietors as the country became more populous grew weary of govern∣ing, and disputes often arising between their governors and the people, agreed to surrender their power, unto queen Anne, A. D. 1702. Lord Cornbury, son to the great earl of Clarendon, was immediately appointed governor, whose behaviour was so arbitrary, mean and trifling, as drew upon him the hatred of the people: It was not uncommon for him to dress himself in a woman's habit and then patrole the fort in which he re∣sided. Such freaks of low humour ex∣posed him to the universal contempt of the people, and their indignation was kindled by his dispotic rules, savage bigotry, insatiable avarice, and injustice, not only to the public but even his pri∣vate creditors; for he left some of his
<PB N="43" REF="028831_0021_0FDE290D96D5A078"/>
lowest tradesmen unsatisfied in their de∣mands, when he succeeded his father to the earldom of Clarendom. When the conduct of such a man is contrasted with the mild administration of the present governor, who unites the great qualities of the statesman with the more amiable and endearing virtues of humanity, how it degrades the former, and enhances the virtues of the latter, and dignifies that pre-eminence he hath obtained by his me∣rit, and the united approbation of his fellow citizens. It appears, from good authority, that the first English settlers of New-Jersey arrived at Salem, so cal∣led by John Fenwick, who brought with him two daughters and several servants; there were also passangers in the same ship, and several other families.</P>
<P>No other ships arrived for two years afterwards: the before-mentioned ship arrived, A. D. 1677. In 1765, another ship arrived with two hundred and thirty passangers on board; these landed near
<PB N="44" REF="028831_0022_0FDE291289736730"/>
Rancocas, and finally settled at Burling∣ton. Indian corn and venison, supplied by the Indians, was their chief food. The same year another ship arrived with a large number of passengers, who set∣tled at Burlington, aforesaid. It would be in vain, to pretend, to gve a particu∣lar description of all the different tribes of Indians that inhabited this country, before the Europeans came amongst them; their nations were commonly distinguished by the names of Creeks, or noted places, where they resided; as the Assunpink, the Rankokas, the Min∣go, the Andastaka, the Neshamine, and the Shackamaxon Indians, &amp;c. Dif∣ferent nations were frequently at war with each other, of which, farmers some∣times find remaining marks in their fields.</P>

intrenchments against the incursions of neighbouring Indians, who, in their ca∣noes used to go and attack the neigh∣bouring tribes. When the Indians bu∣ry their dead, they put their family utensils, bows, arrows, and wam∣pum into the grave with the deceased; leaving the dead in a sitting posture, and covering the grave pyramedically. Their employment was hunting, fish∣ing, fowling, making canoes, bowls, and other wooden ware: their women were employed in planting corn; pounding and baking it it into bread: they would not allow a friend that was dead to be mentioned. The state of New-Jersey is bounded on the west and south-west by Delaware bay and river; on the south-east and east by the Atlantic ocean, the sound, which separates it from Sta∣ten Island, and Hudsons river; on the north, by a line not yet settled, thence to the last river mentioned, in the lati∣tude of 40 degrees, to the notherly

branch of the Delaware in latitude of 41-40, which line, is the boundary of New-York, on that side. The great∣est length of the state of New-Jersey, from north to south, that is from Cape May, in latitude 39 to the north station point in 41-40 at 69 miles to a degree, is one hundred and eighty-four miles; its greatest breadth is about sixty miles, and contains above four millions eight hundred thousand acres of land: it is divided into thirteen counties, and sends five members to congress. The servi∣ces of the late governor Livingston, will be long gratefully remembered by every patriotic member of the state, both as an upright magistrate, and useful citizen; and few have exceeded him on the con∣tinent, for a manly zeal in defence of that liberty, which was so wantonly struck at by the British cabinet, during the administration of lord North. It was this that called forth those distin∣guished talents, which places him in the first list of American writers.</P>

STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE state of Pennsylvania was granted by king Charles, in 1681, to William Penn, son of sir William Penn, Admiral in the Dutch wars, in conside∣ration of a considerable debt due from the crown to his father; but, notwith∣standing the grants made him by the crown, he did not esteem himself the real proprietor, until he had given the Indians a valuable consideration for their country. He therefore came over from England and assembled the sachems or kings, and purchased a very large extent of country from the natives; with whom, he and his successors lived in good harmony: and to this day they mention the name of William Penn with great respect. King Charles cal∣led the country, thus granted, Pennsyl∣vania: in the same year he founded the city of Philadelphia, now the seat of go∣vernment of the United States, and the
<PB N="49" REF="028831_0024_0FDE291F6CE4A148"/>
residence of general Washington; of whose merits, the most studious panege∣ric would fall far short in describing; nor will the compiler of this abstract wound his delicacy in an attempt to dis∣play those shining virtues, which has rendered him famous through the world; but content himself with styling him the friend and father of a numerous and grateful people; the great apostle and successful defender of American liberty; whose name will be handed to distant ages as the model of human perfection, and nations yet unborn shall venerate his name.</P>
<P>The mildness of the government un∣der Penn, induced many of his country∣men, chiefly of the people called qua∣kers, and the prosecuted of other coun∣tries to flock to Pennsylvania, as a safe asylum from their oppressors; nor were they disappointed, finding on their arival that quiet in the peaceful woods, that they in vain sought for under the domi∣nion
<PB N="50" REF="028831_0025_0FDE29252EB12000"/>
of tyrants, of various discriptions, and of none had they more reason to complain than of the clergy, whose fu∣rious bigotry, and blind zeal, pursued them to prisons, and confiscated their estates: happy! thrice happy Ameri∣cans! who have wisely taken care to bar against the encroachment of a do∣mineering clergy, by establishing, upon an immoveable basis, that liberty of conscience so long, and so ardently, pant∣ed after in monarchial governments.</P>
<P>Philadelphia is the capital of Pennsyl∣vania, and is now by far the greatest commercial city on the continent, and is rising fast to that oppulence and magni∣ficence as will soon make her the envy of European powers. The majestic Delaware, upon which the city is built, is exceeded by none on the continent, and by few in Europe, for its conveni∣ency as a harbour for shipping: the Jer∣sey shore, on the other side forms a plea∣sant prospect from the city; and from

STATE OF MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<P>MARYLAND, is bounded on the north by Pennsylvania, by the Atlantic ocean on the east, by Virginia on the south, and by the Apalachian mountains on the west. Maryland is divided into two parts by the bay of Chesapeak, viz. the eastern and western division. This state is watered by innumerable springs and rivers, king Charles the first nam∣ed the state in honour to his queen, Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry the fourth of France, when he granted it to George Calvert, lord Baltimore, A. D. 1613. It is separated from Vir∣ginia by the river Potowmac. It was discovered, in 1606; the lord Baltimore, in the year 1633, sent over his brother, the honourable Leonard Calvert, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with several Roman catholic gentlemen, and other adventurers, to the number of two hundred, who arrived in the bay of Chesapeak the same year, and planted
<PB N="57" REF="028831_0028_0FDE2933E33371B0"/>
the first colony near the mouth of Po∣towmac river, and advancing to the In∣dian town of Yoamico, they were per∣mitted to reside in one part of the town in consideration of some presents they made to the weorance, or prince of the country, who left them in possession of the whole town, as soon as his people had got in their harvest. Whereupon, the governor, Calvert, gave the town the name of St. Mary. While the En∣glish were improving the country, the Indians hunted for them in the woods, and brought in great quantities of veni∣son and wild fowl. Many other Roman catholics coming over from England to avoid the penal laws it soon became a flourishing colony; of which, the Cal∣verts remained governors, until the civil wars in England; when the family were deprived of it, but recovered it again at the restoration of king Charles the second, when the honourable Charles Calvert, son of lord Baltimore, remain∣ed

governor near twenty years. Tobac∣co is raised in this state in large quanti∣ties. The inhabitants are remarkable for their hospitality, yet they do not ex∣ceed their neighbours the Virginians, in the practice of this engaging virtue, ac∣compained with pleasing manners, and a graceful easy carriage. This state sends eight members to congress. The rivers and numerous bays and creeks that indent the land on every side enable the sailors to bring their vessels to the planters doors, to receive their freights of tobacco, &amp;c. The air in this coun∣try is excessive hot in the summer sea∣son, and equally cold in winter, when the north-west wind blows. On the first planting of Maryland there were several nations of Indians; but now it is rare to see one in the state: It is, however, well stocked with negroes, which some people think a poor exchange.</P>

VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE rich and populous state of Vir∣ginia is bounded by the river Potow∣mac, which divides it from Maryland on the north-east; by the Atlantic ocean on the east; by Carolina on the south; and by the Apalachian mountains on the west; into the west side of the bay falls four great rivers, which rise in the Apa∣lachian mountains, running from the north-west to the south-east; the most southerly is James river; the Indian name of this river was Powhatan. The great bay of Chesapeak runs up through Virginia and Maryland, almost due north, three hundred miles and upwards. North of Rappahanic river is the great river Potowmac, which runs, and is na∣vigable, near two hundred miles. As we approach Virginia from the ocean, it appears to be low lands, and for a hundred miles up into the country, there is scarce a hill or stone to be met with.
<PB N="61" REF="028831_0030_0FDE2940BB202390"/>
The woods are lofty, and but little un∣der-wood to intercept travellers in their passage, through the state, who never want a fine shade to protect them from the summer heats. No country pro∣duces greater quantities of excellent tobacco: sir Walter Raleigh obtained a grant from queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1584, of all such lands as he should dis∣cover in North America, between 33 and 40 degrees of north latitude; and to dispose of them in fee simple, or other∣wise, to any of the subjects of Great-Britain. Whereupon, sir Walter form∣ed a society amongst his friends, who contributed large sums and provided two ships to go upon the expedition, who set sail the 20th of April, A. D. 1514, and arrived on the coast of Carolina, in 34 degrees 15 minutes north latitude, where they bartered with the natives for skins and furs, and loaded their ships with sasafras, cedar, and tobacco; which last, was cried up in England as a most
<PB N="62" REF="028831_0031_0FDE294943305478"/>
valuable plant, and a remedy for almost every disease. There is a diverting anecdote in sir Walter's life, in which, we are informed, that as he was private∣ly smoking a pipe in his closet, his ser∣vant, a stranger to the use of it, coming into the closet with a mug of ale, and seeing the smoke issuing from his mas∣ter's mouth, was astonished, and empty∣ed the mug in his face, and immediately alarmed the family, insisting in positive terms that his master was on fire. Sir Walter called the country he had dis∣covered Virginia, in honour to his mis∣tress, a maiden queen. Another set of adventurers arrived from England, April 26th, 1607, and came up the Chesapeak, and thence up James river, and landed on a Peninsula, about fifty miles up the river, where they built a fort, and a town, which they named James town: this was the first town built upon the continent of America by the English. This state sends nineteen
<PB N="63" REF="028831_0031_0FDE294943305478"/>
members to congress; and has the merit of having produced some of the greatest men in the union: a Washington, a Randolph and a Lee, with other distin∣guished characters.</P>
<P>None were more zealous than the Vir∣ginians, in the cause of American liber∣ty; none possess the powers of eloquence in a greater degree; but yet, there is not a Willberforce amongst them.</P>

They ship off from South-Carolina, yearly, large quantities of rice, deer skins, pitch and tar, to a considerable amount. Their tar is es∣teemed in Europe as good as the Nor∣way tar: their chief trade for skins and furs, is with the Creeks and Cherokee Indians. This state suffered much in the time of the late war, when lord Cornwallis, the most enterprizing of∣ficer in the British army, reduced the

inhabitants to great straits; they also suf∣fered much from the disaffected of their own state: hence, murthers, house-burning, and all the concomitant horrors of civil war desolated this once flourish∣ing state, and banished for many months the comforts of domestic life; until the independence of the United States was finally ratified, by the court of Great Britain. Carolina, was the last coun∣try planted in America, that was plant∣ed by the British, the first proprietors, after sir Walter Raleigh relinquished his claim, was Edward earl of Claren∣don, lord Chancellor, George, duke of Albemarl, William lord Craven, John lord Berkley, the lord Anthony Ashley Cooper, sir George Cartarect, sir Wil∣liam Colleton, and their heirs; but these being unsuccessful, sold their shares to the crown.

NORTH-CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS state was included with South-Carolina and Georgia in one grant, and was a proprietary govern∣ment; but by the disagreement of the parties concerned became subject to the crown. Edenton, situated near the Pas∣quotank, is an ancient town, but is not in a flourishing state, owing to the bad∣ness of the navigation: Newbern is the capital. The country near the rivers is unhealthy; intermitting fevers are com∣mon in Autumn, and the people look sickly. In the bays, and by the side of large rivers are found the alligators, or American crocodile: It has a large mouth, furnished with sharp teeth; this dreadful creature grows to the length of seventeen or eighteen feet. As we go to the south they are more fierce and ra∣venous: like the wolf, when pressed by hunger, it will swallow mud or even stones: they float on the water, in sum∣mer
<PB N="69" REF="028831_0034_0FDE295AB43AB658"/>
seasons, and look much like an old log; and should any person venture to gratify his curiosity, the attempt might be fatal. There has been several exam∣ples of crocodiles taking a man out of a canoe, in sight of his companions, with∣out their being able to lend them any assistance. It often lurks by the side of a bank near the river, and there patient∣ly waits for some land animal, coming to drink, be it a man, tyger, bull or dog; it seizes the victim with a spring, and having secured his prey with teeth and claws, he sinks with it to the bot∣tom of the river, and it is soon drowned. The tyger, as soon as he is seized by this enemy, immediately turns with great agility and forces his claws in his eyes, while he is plunged by his fierce antagonist into the water, where he is soon destroyed. Notwithstanding all this it is related by good authority, that a single negro will jump into the river, and make battle with this monster, in
<PB N="70" REF="028831_0035_0FDE295F772756C8"/>
his own element; with a knife in his right hand, and his left arm wrapped round with a piece of cow hide: being thus prepared, as the crocodile ap∣proaches he holds out his left arm, which is instantly and greedily swallowed, but as it sticks in his throat, the knife in his right hand is busily employed in stab∣bing him below the chin, a place easily vulnerable and the water also getting in the mouth, the creature is soon bloated up as big as a tun and expires.

STATE OF KENTUCKY.</HEAD>
<P>KENTUCKY was formerly a part of the state of Virginia, but admitted into the Union as an independent state, by act of congress, on the 1st day of June, 1792: this state is situated between 36-39 of north latitude; and between 8 and 15 degrees of west longitude, from Philadelphia, being about four hun∣dred miles in length from north-east to south-east; and about two hundred miles in breadth. It is bounded to the west∣ward by the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, on the south by a parrallel of latitude, which divides it from the territory ceded to the United States by North Carolina, to the eastward by the Cumberland mountain, and to the northward by the Great Sandy river. The Ohio river, washes the north-western side of this state, in its whole extent; except about thirty miles, which is bounded by the Mississippi. The rapid settlement and
<PB N="75" REF="028831_0037_0FDE2968F0DEC1E8"/>
population of the state, notwithstanding the united opposition of all the western Indians, almost exceed belief. It was in the year 1775, that the first family settled in this country, at that time a forest, inhabited only by wild beasts. By the census taken in 1791, according to the returns, it contained 75,000 souls; but from the great numbers of emigrants, who daily repair to that country, from the different states, there must now be more than double that number. The inhabitants enjoy a happy temperature of climate: snow seldom falls deep or lies long, and the rivers are rarely frozen over: it includes the largest body of the most fertile land in the United States, suitable to the pro∣duction of every kind of grain. Horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry of every kind are raised here in great numbers, and with little trouble or expense, owing chiefly to the shortness of the winters, and great abundance of food. The ri∣vers
<PB N="76" REF="028831_0038_0FDE296FAC8BF9F8"/>

THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL MONTGOMERY de∣scended from a respectable fami∣ly in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to li∣bery was innate, and matured by a fine education and an excellent understand∣ing. Having married, and purchased an estate in New-York, he was, from
<PB N="82" REF="028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8"/>
these circumstances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con∣viction of the justness of her cause indu∣ced to consider himself as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cause, and quitted the sweets of easy fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philosophical rural life, with the highest domestic felicity, to take an active share in all the hardships and dangers that at∣tend the soldier's life.</P>
<P>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the service of En∣gland, and had successfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que∣bec, in the war of 1756, on the very spot, where when fighting under the standard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms against her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu∣ral contest, was more sincerely, or more universally lamented. And what is ex∣traordinary, the most eminent speakers in the British parliament, forgetting for
<PB N="83" REF="028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8"/>
the moment, that he had died in oppo∣sing their cruel and oppressive measures, displayed all their eloquence in praising his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow sol∣dier of his in the French war of 1756, shed abundance of tears, while he expa∣tiated on their past friendship and mutu∣al exchange of tender services in that season of enterprise and glory.</P>
<P>All enmity to this veteran soldier ex∣pired with his life; and respect to his private character prevailed over all other considerations. By the orders of Gene∣ral Carlton, his remains received eve∣ry possible mark of distinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the first day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave soldier.</P>
<P>Congress were not unmindful of the merit of this amiable and brave officer, nor remiss in manifesting the esteem and respect they entertained of his memory. Considering it not only as a tribute of
<PB N="84" REF="028831_0042_0FDE2984B994A190"/>
gratitude justly due to the memory of those who had peculiarly distinguished themselves in the glorious cause of li∣berty, to perpetuate their names by the most durable monuments erected to their honour, but greatly conducive to inspire posterity with emulation of their illustrious actions, that honourable body</P>
<P><HI>"Resolved,</HI> That to express the ve∣neration of the United Colonies for their late General, <HI>Richard Montgomery,</HI> and the deep sense they entertain of the many signal and important services of that gallant officer, who, after a series of successes, amidst the most discourag∣ing difficulties, fell at length in a gal∣lant attack upon Quebec, the capital of Canada; and to transmit to future ages, as examples truly worthy of imitation, his patriotism, conduct, boldness of en∣terprise, insuperable perseverance, and contempt of danger and death; a mo∣nument be procured from Paris, or other parts of France, with an inscription sa∣cred

<Q>TO THE GLORY OF RICHARD MONTGOMERY, Major General of the armies of the United States of America, Slain at the siege of Quebec, the 31st of December, 1775, aged 38 years.</Q>
<P><PB N="86" REF="028831_0043_0FDE298B8CF04950"/>This elegant monument has lately been erected in front of St. Paul's church in New-York.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable circumstance connected with the fall of this brave offi∣cer, that merits to be recorded, because the fact is of a very interesting nature, and will serve to perpetuate the memo∣ry of a very amiable and deserving cha∣racter, who was also a martyr in the cause of his country. The circumstance is this:</P>
<P>One of General Montgomery's Aids-de-Camp, was Mr. Macpherson, a most promising young man, whose fa∣ther resided at Philadelphia, and was greatly distinguished in privateering in the war of 1756. This gentleman had a brother in the sixteenth regiment, in the British service, at the time of Mont∣gomery's expedition into Canada, and who was as violent in favour of the English government, as this General's Aid-de-Camp was enthusiastic in the
<PB N="87" REF="028831_0043_0FDE298B8CF04950"/>
cause of America; the latter had ac∣companied his General a day or two previous to the attack in which they both lost their lives, to view and medi∣tate on the spot where Wolf had fallen; on his return he found a letter from his brother, the English officer, full of the bitterest reproaches against him, for hav∣ing entered into the American service, and containing a pretty direct wish, that if he would not abandon it, he might meet with the deserved fate of a rebel. The Aid-de-Camp immediately return∣ed him an answer, full of strong reason∣ing in defence of his conduct, but by no means attempting to make the opposite principles of his brother, and not only free from acrimony, but full of expres∣sions of tenderness and affection; this letter he dated, "From the spot where Wolf lost his life, in fighting the cause of England, <HI>in friendship with Ameri∣ca.</HI>" This letter had scarcely reached the officer at New-York, before it was fol∣lowed
<PB N="88" REF="028831_0044_0FDE299284DCC810"/>
by the news of his brother's death. The effect was instantaneous, nature, and perhaps reason prevailed; and a thousand, not unworthy sentiments rush∣ed upon his distressed mind; he quitted the English service, entered into that of America, and sought every occasion of distinguishing himself in her service!</P>

SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE LATE NATHANIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gallant officer, whose death is so generally and so justly regret∣ted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-Island, in or about the year 1741, and was the second son of a respectable citizen of the same name (descended from some of the first settlers in the colony,) who was extensively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8"/>The subject of this sketch was en∣dowed with an uncommon degree of judgement and penetration, which with a benevolent manner and affable beha∣viour, acquired him a number of valua∣ble friends, by whose interest and influ∣ence, he was, at an early period of life, chosen a member of the assembly of the then colony of Rhode-Island. This trust, in which he gave the highest sa∣tisfaction to his constituents; he continu∣ed to possess until, and at the period, when the folly and madness of England severed a world from her empire.</P>
<P>After the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, when a spirit of resistance spread like wild fire over the continent, Rhode-Island was not deficient in her contributions for the general defence: she raised three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nominated brigadier-general. The liberty, safety, and pros∣perity of his country being exposed to
<PB N="93" REF="028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8"/>
imminent danger, the pacific principles of Quakerism, in which he had been educated, proved insufficient to combat the ardent spirit of liberty with which his bosom glowed.</P>
<P>He led the troops under his command to Cambridge, and was present at the evacuation of Boston, by a force which had in England been vauntingly stated treble the number that would be requi∣site to dragoon America into uncondi∣tional submission.</P>
<P>General Greene's merit and abilities, as well in council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by Gen. Washing∣ton, who reposed in him the utmost con∣fidence, and paid particular deference to his advice and opinion on all occcasions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealousy of several officers of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to supplant him: but in vain—the commander in chief knew, and prized his worth as it deserv∣ed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0"/>He was appointed major-general by congress, the 26th of August, 1776. Towards the close of that year he was at the Trenton surprize, and at the be∣ginning of the next, was at the battle of Princetown, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciously execut∣ed, in both of which he highly distin∣guished himself, serving his noviciate under the American Fabius.</P>
<P>At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame∣rican army, and his utmost endeavours were excited to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his met with the ap∣probation of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>In March, 1778, he was appointed quarter-master-general, which office he accepted under a stipulation that his rank in the army should not be affected by it, and that he should retain his right to command in time of action, ac∣cording to his rank and seniority. This he exercised at the battle of Monmouth,
<PB N="95" REF="028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0"/>
where he commanded the right wing of the army.</P>
<P>About the middle of the same year, an attack, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode-Island, being planned, General Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom Gen. Greene served. This attempt was unsucces∣ful: the French fleet having sailed out of harbour to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were dispersed by a storm, and the Americans were obliged to raise the siege of Newport, in doing which General Greene displayed a great degree of skill in drawing off the army in safety.</P>
<P>After the hopes of the British Gene∣rals, to execute some decisive stroke to the northward, were frustrated, they turned their attention to the southern states, as less capable of defence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expidition was
<PB N="96" REF="028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230"/>
in consequence, planned at New-York, where the army embarked on or about the 26th day of December, 1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within thirty miles of Charleston, which, after a brave defence, was surrendered to sir Henry Clinton, on the twelfth of May.</P>
<P>A series of ill success followed this unfortunate event: the American arms in South Carolina were in general un∣successful, and the inhabitants were obliged to submit to the invaders, whose impolitic severity was extremely ill calculated to answer any of the objects for which the war had been commenced.</P>
<P>Affairs were thus circumstanced, when General Washington appointed General Greene to the command of the American forces in the southern district. He arrived at Charlotte, on the second day of December, 1780, accompanied by General Morgan, a brave officer, who had distinguished himself to the
<PB N="97" REF="028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230"/>
northward, in the expidetion against Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command reduced to a very small number by defeat and by desertion. The returns were nine hundred and seventy continentals and one thousand and thir∣teen militia; military stores, provisions, forages and all things necessary, were if possible in a more reduced state than his army. His men were without pay and almost without cloathing, and sup∣plies of the latter were not to be had but from a distance of two hundred miles. In this perilous situation, he had to op∣pose a respectable and victorious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of some of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwise disposed, to remain neuter, or take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent measures the general took for removing the innumerable dif∣ficulties and disadvantages he was sur∣rounded with, and for conciliating the affections of the inhabitants, soon brought
<PB N="98" REF="028831_0049_0FDE29AC8A7D3228"/>
together a considerable force, far inferi∣or, however, to that of the British, who esteemed the country perfectly subjugat∣ed.</P>
<P>The happy period at length arrived, when by virtue and bravery of her sons, aided by the bounty of heaven, America compelled her invaders to recognize her independence. Then her armies quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happiness. Amongst the rest, General Greene revisited his native country, where he proved himself as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witnessed him a gallant officer. Dissensions and jealousies had extended their destructive influence among the Rhode-Islanders, and their animosity had arisen to such a degree, as to threaten the most serious ill consequences: Ge∣neral Greene exerted himself to restore harmony and peace amongst them once more, and was happily successful.</P>
<P>In October, 1785, he sailed to Geor∣gia, where he had a considerable estate,
<PB N="99" REF="028831_0049_0FDE29AC8A7D3228"/>
not far distant from Savanah: here he passed away his time, occupied in his domestic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June last, we are told, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the sun, which brought on a disorder, that carried him off a few days after, on the 19th of the same month.</P>
<P>When the melancholy account of his death was arrived at Savannah, the peo∣ple were struck with the deepest sorrow.</P>
<P>All business was suspended; the shops and stores throughout the town were shut; and the shipping in the harbour had their colours half masted.</P>
<P>The body was brought to Savannah, and interred on the 20th: the funeral procession was attended by the Cincina∣ti, militia, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the following or∣der:</P>
<P>The corps of artillery, the light in∣fantry, the militia of Chatham county, clerygmen and physicians, band of music.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="028831_0050_0FDD5D0ACBD43E78"/>The corpse and pall-bearers, escorted on each side by a company of dragoons, the principle mourners, the members of the Cincinnati as mourners; the speaker of the assembly, and other civil of∣ficers of the state, citizens and stran∣gers. Immediately after the interment of the corpse, the members of the Cin∣cinnati retired to the coffee-house in Sa∣vannah, and came to the following re∣solution:</P>
<P>"That as a token of the high respect and veneration in which this society hold the memory of their late illustrious bro∣ther, major General Greene, deceased, George Washington Greene, his eldest son be admitted a member of this society, to take his seat on his arriving at the age of eighteen years.</P>
<P>General Greene left behind him a wife and five children, the eldest of whom is about eleven years old.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the 12th of August, the United States in congress assembled came to the following resolution:</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="028831_0050_0FDD5D0ACBD43E78"/>That a monument be erected to the memory of Nathaniel Greene, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> at the seat of federal government with the following inscription:
<Q>Sacred to the memory of NATHANIEL GREENE, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> who departed this life, on the 19th of June, 1786; late Major General in the service of the United States, and Commander of their Army in the Southern department: The United States in Congress assembled, in honour of his Patriotism, Valour, and Abilities, have erected this Monument.</Q></P>

A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF ISRAEL PUTNAM, SENIOR MAJOR GENERAL IN THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>ISRAEL PUTNAM, who, through a regular gradation of promotion be∣came the Senior Major General in the army of the United States, and next in rank to General Washington, was born at Salem, in the province, now state of Massachusetts, on the 7th day of January, 1718. His father, captain Joseph Putnam, was the son of Mr.
<PB N="104" REF="028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0"/>
John Putnam, who, with two brothers, came from the south of England, and were among the first settlers of Salem.</P>
<P>When we thus behold a person, from the humble walks of life, starting un∣noticed in the career of fame, and by an undeviating progress through a life of honour, arriving at the highest dignity in the state; curiosity is strongly excit∣ed, and philosophy loves to trace the path of glory from the cradle of obscuri∣ty to the summit of elevation.</P>
<P>His disposition was as frank and gene∣rous as his mind was fearless and inde∣pendent. He disguised nothing; indeed he seemed incapable of disguise. Per∣haps, in the intercourse he was ultimate∣ly obliged to have with an artful world, his sincerity on some occasions, outwent his discretion. Although he had too much mildness in his nature to com∣mence a quarrel, he had too much sen∣sibility not to feel, and too much ho∣nour not to resent an intended insult.
<PB N="105" REF="028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0"/>
The first time he went to Boston, he was insulted for his rusticity by a boy of twice his size and age; after bearing his sarcasms until his patience was worn out, he challenged, engaged and vanquished his unmannerly antagonist, to the great diversion of a croud of spec∣tators. While a strippling, his ambi∣tion was to perform the labour of a man, and to excell in athletic diversions. In that rude, but masculine age, whenever the village youth assembled, on their usual occasions of festivity; pitching the bar, running, leaping and wrestling were favourite amusements. At such gymnastic exercises (in which during the heroic times of ancient Greece and Rome, conquest was considered as the promise of future military fame) he bore the palm from almost every ring.</P>
<P>In the year 1739, he removed from Salem to Pomfret, an inland fertile town in Connecticut, forty miles east of Hartford: having here purchased a con∣siderable
<PB N="106" REF="028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540"/>
tract of land, he applied him∣self successfully to agriculture.</P>
<P>Mr. Putnam, before he attained the twenty-first year of his age, married Miss Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope, of Salem, by whom he had ten children, seven of whom are still living. He lost the wife of his youth in 1764: sometime after he married Mrs. Gardiner, widow of the late Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's Island, by whom he had no issue: she died in 1777.</P>
<P>Our farmer had to encounter not on∣ly the calamities occasioned by drought in summer, blast in harvest, loss of cattle in winter, but the desolation of his sheep-folds by wolves. In one night he had seventy fine sheep and goats killed, besides many lambs and kids wounded: this havock was committed by a she wolf, which, with her annual whelps had for several years infested the vicinity. The young were commonly destroyed by the vigilance of the hun∣ters,
<PB N="107" REF="028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540"/>
but the old one was too sagacious to come within reach of gunshot: when closely pursued she would generally fly to the western woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps.</P>
<P>This wolf at length, became such an intolerable nuisance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbours to hunt alternately un∣til they could destroy her. Two, by rotation, were to be constantly in pur∣suit; having lost the toes from one foot, by a steel trap, she made one track shorter than the other. By this vestige, the pursuers, recognized in a light snow, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Con∣necticut river, and found she had turned back in a direct course towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles distant from the house of
<PB N="108" REF="028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8"/>
Mr. Putnam. The people soon collect∣ed with dogs, guns, straw, fire, and sul∣pher, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus several unsuccess∣ful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refused to return. The smoke of blazing straw had no effect; nor did the fumes of burnt brimstone, with which the cavern was filled, com∣pel her to quit the retirement. Weari∣ed with such fruitless attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain: he proposed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and shoot the wolf; the negro declined the hazardous service: then it was, that their master, angry at the disappointment, and declaring that he was ashamed to have a coward in his family, resolved himself to destroy the ferocious beast, least she should escape through some unknown sissure of the
<PB N="109" REF="028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8"/>
rock. His neighbours strongly remon∣strated against the perilous enterprize; but he knowing, that wild animals are intimidated by fire, and having provided several strips of birch-bark, the only combustible material which he could obtain, that would afford light in this deep and darksome cave, prepared for his descent. Having accordingly divested himself of his coat and waistcoat, and having a long rope fastened round his legs by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted signal, he entered head foremost with the blazing torch in his hand.</P>
<P>The aperture of the den, on the east side of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet square; from thence it descends obliquely fifteen feet, then run∣ning horizontally about ten more, it as∣cends gradually sixteen feet towards its termination. The sides of this subterra∣neous cavity are composed of smooth and solid rocks, which seem to have been
<PB N="110" REF="028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848"/>
divided from each other by some former earthquake. The top and bottom are al∣so of stone, and the entrance, in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly slippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to raise himself upright; nor in any part more than three feet in width.</P>
<P>Having groped his passage to the ho∣rizontal part of the den, the most terri∣fying darkness appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was silent as the house of death: none but monsters of the desert had ever before explored this solitary man∣sion of horror. He, cautiously proceed∣ing onward, came to the ascent, which he slowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he discovered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was sitting at the extremity of the cavern. Start∣led at the sight of fire, she gnashed her teeth and gave a sullen growl. As soon as he made the necessary discovery, he kicked the rope as a signal for pulling
<PB N="111" REF="028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848"/>
him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had listened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and supposing their friend to be in imminent danger, drew him forth with such celerity that his shirt was stripped over his head, and his skin severely lace∣trated. After he had adjusted his cloaths and loaded his gun with nine buck-shot, holding a torch in one hand and the mus∣ket in the other, he descended the second time, when, he drew nearer than before, the wolf assuming a still more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, snapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evident∣ly in the attitude and on the point of springing at him. At the critical instant, he levelled and fired at her head: stun∣ned with the shock, and suffocated with the smoke, he immediately found him∣self drawn out of the cave; but having refreshed himself, and permitted the smoke to dissipate, he went down the
<PB N="112" REF="028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38"/>
third time; once more he came within sight of the wolf, who appearing very passive he applied the torch to her nose and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope, (still tied round his legs) the people above, with no small exultation dragged them both out together.</P>
<P>But the time had now arrived which was to turn the instruments of husband∣ry into weapons of hostility, and to ex∣change the hunting of wolves, who had ravaged the sheep-folds, for the pursuit after savages who had desolated the frontiers. Mr. Putnam was about thir∣ty-seven years old, when the war be∣tween England and France, which pre∣ceeded the last, broke out in America. His reputation must have been favoura∣bly known to the government, since the first troops that were levied by Con∣necticut. In 1755, he was appointed to the command of a company in Lyman's regiment of provincials: the regiment
<PB N="113" REF="028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38"/>
joined the army, at the opening of the campaign, not far distant from Crown∣point. The time for which the colonial troops were to serve, terminated with the campaign. Putnam was re-appoint∣ed, and again took the field in 1756.</P>
<P>The active services of captain Put∣nam, on every occasion, attracted the admiration of the public, and induced the legislature of Connecticut to pro∣mote him to a majority in 1757.</P>
<P>In the month of August, five hun∣dred men were employed under the or∣ders of majors Rogers and Putnam, to watch the motions of the enemy near Ticonderoga. Upon being, sometime afterwards, discovered, they concerted measures for returning to fort Edward: at the moment of moving, the famous French partizan, Molang, who had been sent with five hundred men to in∣tercept our party, was not more than one mile and an half distant from them; having heard the firing, he hasted to lay
<PB N="114" REF="028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0"/>
an ambuscade precisely in that part of the wood most favourable to his project. Major Putnam was just emerging from the thickest, into the common forest, when the enemy rose, and with discor∣dant yells and whoops, commenced an attack upon the right of his division. Surprized, but undismayed, Putnam hastily returned the fire, and perceiving it would be impracticable to cross the creek, determined to maintain his ground: inspired by his example, the officers and men behaved with great bravery: sometimes they fought aggre∣gately in open view, and sometimes in∣dividually under cover; taking aim from behind the bodies of trees, and acting in a manner independent of each other; for himself having discharged his fusil se∣veral times, at length it missed fire, while the muzzle was pressed against the breast of a large well proportioned Savage. This warrior, availing him∣self of the indefensible attitude of his ad∣versary,
<PB N="115" REF="028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0"/>
with a tremendous war-hoop sprang forward, with his lifted hatchet, and compelled him to surrender; and having disarmed and bound him fast to a tree, returned to the battle.</P>
<P>The intrepid captains, D'Ell and Harman, who now commanded, were forced to give ground for a little distance, the Savages, conceiving this to be the certain harbinger of victory, rushed im∣petuously on, with dreadful and redoubl∣ed cries: but our two partizans, col∣lecting a handful of brave men, gave the pursuers so warm a reception as to oblige them, in turn to retreat a little beyond the spot where the action first commenced: here they made a stand. This change of ground, occasioned the tree to which Putnam was tied to be directly between the fire of the two par∣ties. Human imagination can hardly figure to itself a more deplorable situa∣tion. The balls flew incessantly from either side, many struck the tree, while
<PB N="116" REF="028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538"/>
some passed through the sleeves and skirts of his coat. In this state of jeo∣pardy, unable to move his body, to stir his limbs, or even to recline his head, he remained more than an hour: so equally ballanced, and so obstinate the fight. At one moment, while the battle served in favour of the enemy, a young savage, chose an odd way of discovering his hu∣mor: he found Putnam bound: he might have dispatched him at a blow: but he loved better to excite the terrors of the prisoner, by hurling a tomahawk at his head; or rather it should seem his object was to see how near he could throw it without touching him; the weapon struck in the tree a number of times at a hairs breadth distance from the mark. When the Indian had finished his amusement, a French bas-officer (a much more inveterate savage by nature, though descended from so humane and polished a nation) perceiving Putnam, came up to him, and levelling a fusil
<PB N="117" REF="028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538"/>
within a foot of his breast, attempted to discharge it; it missed fire. Ineffectual∣ly did the intended victim, solicit the treatment due to his situation, by re∣peating that he was a prisoner of war. The degenerate Frenchman did not un∣derstand the language of honour or na∣ture▪ deaf to their voice, and dead to sensibility, he violently and repeatedly, pushed the muzzle of his gun against Putnam's ribs, and finally gave him a cruel blow on the cheek with the butt of his piece: after this dastardly deed he left him.</P>
<P>At length the active intrepedity of D'Ell and Harman, seconded by the persevering valour of their followers, pre∣vailed; they drove from the field the enemy, who left about ninety dead be∣hind them. As they were retiring Put∣nam was untied by the Indian who had made him prisoner, and whom he after∣wards called master. Having been con∣ducted for some distance from the place
<PB N="118" REF="028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478"/>
of action, he was stripped of his coat, vest, stockings and shoes, and loaded with as many of the packs of the woun∣ded as could be piled upon him: strong∣ly pinioned, and his wrists tied as closely together as they could be pulled with a cord. After he had marched, through no pleasant paths, in this painful man∣ner, many miles, the party (who were much fatigued) halted to rest. His hands were now immoderately swelled from the tightness of the ligature; and the pain had become intolerable. His feet were so much scratched that the blood dropped fast from them. Exhausted with bearing a burden above his strength, and frantick with torment, exquisite be∣yond endurance; he entreated the Irish interpreter to implore, as the last and only grace he desired of the savages, that they would knock him on the head and take his scalp at once, or loose his hands. A French officer instantly interposing, ordered his hands to be unbound and some of the packs to be taken off.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478"/>By this time, the Indian who cap∣tured him, and had been absent with the wounded, coming up, gave him a pair of mocasons, and expressed great indignation at the unworthy treatment his prisoner had suffered.</P>
<P>The savage cheif again returned to the care of the wounded, and the Indians, about two hundred in number, went be∣fore the rest of the party to the place where the whole were, that night, to en∣camp. They took with them Major Putnam, on whom (besides innumera∣ble other outrages) they had the barba∣rity to inflict a deep wound with a to∣mahawk, in the left cheek. His suf∣ferings were in this place consummated. A scene of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes before, was now preparing: it was determined to roast him alive. For this purpose, they led him into a dark forest, stripped him nak∣ed bound him to a tree, and piled dry brush with other fuel, at a small dis¦tance,
<PB N="120" REF="028831_0060_0FDD1DB59102B0C8"/>
in a circle round him. They accompanied their labours, as if for his funeral dirge, with screams and sounds inimitable but by savage voices: then they set the piles on fire; a sudden shower damped the rising flame. Still they strove to kindle it, until, at last, the blaze ran fiercely round the circle: Ma∣jor Putnam soon began to feel the scorching heat. His hands were so tied that he could move his body. He oft∣en shifted sides as the fire approached. This sight, at the very idea of which, all but savages, must shudder, afforded the highest diversion to his inhuman tormen∣tors; who demonstrated the delirium of their joy by correspondent yells, dances and gesticulations. He saw clearly that his final hour was inevitably come: he summoned all his resolution and com∣posed his mind, as far as his circum∣stances would admit, to bid an eternal farewell to all he held most dear. To quit the world would scarcely have cost
<PB N="121" REF="028831_0060_0FDD1DB59102B0C8"/>
him a single pang; but for the idea of home, but for the remembrance of do∣mestic endearments, of the affectionate partner of his soul, and their beloved of∣spring. His thoughts was ultimately fixed on a happier state of existence, be∣yond the tortures he was beginning to endure. The bitterness of death, even of that death which is accompanied with the keenest agonies, was in a manner past; nature, with a feeble struggle, was quitting its last hold on sublunary things; when a French officer rushed through the crowd, opened away by scat∣tering the burning brands, and unbound the victim. It was Molang himself, to whom a savage, unwilling to see another human sacrifice immolated, had ran and communicated the tidings. That com∣mandant spurned and severely repri∣manded the barbarians, whose noctur∣nal powers and hellish orgies he sudden∣ly ended. Putnam did not want for feel∣ing or gratitude. The French com∣mander

fearing to trust him alone with them, remained until he could deliver him in safety into the hands of his master.</P>
<P>The savage approached his prisoner kindly and seemed to treat him with particular affection, but being deter∣mined, however, not to lose his captive he took the mocasons, from his feet and tied them to one of his wrists; then di∣recting him to lie down on his back on the bare ground, he stretched one arm to its full length, and bound it fast to a young tree; the other arm was extend∣ed and bound in the same manner: his legs were stretched apart and fastened to two saplings, then a number of tall but slender poles were cut down; which with some long bushes, were laid across his body, from head to foot: on each side lay as many Indians as could con∣veniently find lodging, in order to pre∣vent the possibility of his escape. In this disagreeable and painful posture he re∣mained until morning. During this
<PB N="123" REF="028831_0061_0FDD1DB711A0DCF8"/>
night, the longest and most dreary con∣ceivable, our hero used to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulness come casually across his mind, and could not even re∣frain from smiling when he reflected on this ludicrous groupe for a painter, of which he himself was the principal fi∣gure.</P>
<P>At night, the party arrived at Ticon∣deroga, and the prisoner was placed un∣der a strong French guard. After hav∣ing been examined by the marquis de Montcalm, Major Putnam was con∣ducted to Montreal by a French officer, who treated him with the greatest in∣dulgence and humanity.</P>
<P>To mention the dangers and difficul∣ties that this brave officer underwent both before and after he was taken cap∣tive by the savages, is beyond my li∣mits, suffice it to say, that at the expi∣ration of ten years from his first receiv∣ing a commission, after having seen as much service, endured as many hadships,
<PB N="124" REF="028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0"/>
encountered as many dangers, and ac∣quired as many laurels as any officer of his rank, with great satisfaction laid aside his uniform and returned to his plough, which occupation he followed until the fatal day arrived, when hosti∣lities commenced between Great Britain and her colonies, now the United States of America. As he happened to be oft∣en at Boston, he held many conversa∣tions on these subjects with General Gage, the British commander in cheif, lord Peircy, colonel Sheriff, colonel Small, and many officers with whom he had formerly served, who were now at the head quarters. Being often ques∣tioned—in case the dispute should pro∣ceed to hostilities, what part he would take, he always answered, with his coun∣try, and, that let whatever might hap∣pen, he was prepared to abide the con∣sequence. Being interrogated,—whe∣ther he, who had been a witness to the prowess and victories of the British fleets
<PB N="125" REF="028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0"/>
and armies, did not think them equal to the conquest of a country which was not the owner of a single ship, regiment or magazine. He rejoined, that he could only say, justice would be on our side, and the event with Providence; but that he had calculated, if it required six years for the combined forces of Eng∣land and her colonies to conquer such a feeble country as Canada, it would at least, take a very long time for England alone to overcome her own widely ex∣tended colonies, which were much strong∣er than Canada: that when men fought for every thing dear, what they believed to be the most sacred of all causes, and in their own native land, they would have great advantages over their ene∣mies, who were not in the same situa∣tion; and that, having taken into view all circumstances, for his own part, he fully believed that America would not be so easily conquered by England as those gentlemen seemed to expect. Be∣ing

once, in particular, asked whether he did not seriously believe that a well ap∣pointed British army of five thousand veterans could march through the whole continent of America? He replied brisk∣ly, no doubt, if they behaved civilly and paid well for every thing they wanted, but, after a moments pause, added—if they should attempt it in a hostile man∣ner (though the American men were out of the question) the women with their ladles and broom sticks, would knock them all on the head before they had got half way through. This was the tenor of these amicable interviews.</P>
<P>Thus our hero on hearing of the com∣mencement of hostilities at Lexington (who was ploughing when he heard the news) he left his plough in the middle of the field: unyoked his team, and with∣out waiting to change his clothes, set off for the theatre of action, and so continu∣ed to act in defence of his country until thea yer 1779, at which time he was ta∣ken
<PB N="127" REF="028831_0063_0FDD5CACADEB3BD8"/>
with an unusual torpor in his right hand and foot, which gradually increas∣ed upon him, until it deprived him of the use of his limbs on that side, and which terminated the carreer of his servces. He died the 29th September, 1790.</P>
