Hence rose <HI>Peters</HI> resolution as long as he abode in his Tabernacle to put them always in remem∣brance, though they were established in the present truth. The sacred Assemblies at our Elections presents <HI>New-Englands</HI> representatives, as sometimes Israels before <HI>Joshuah,</HI> yea, before the Lord: Hence stirs up from the same spirit in all the faithful messengers of Christ to whom on such days the door of opportunity and utterance is opened, an earnest de∣sire to leave their solemn testimony for Gods Glory and this peoples good; Such is this Sermon now in thine hand: Therefore the more diligently to be attended by all that unfeignedly love our Lord Iesus, their souls, fami∣lies Churches, and this Colony. Though the Prophets dye, yet such words will live to take hold of those that will not hear, as they did of Israel. 'Tis an observation worth observing, Israels liberty from <HI>Egypt</HI> began with the meeting and kissing of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> in the mount of God, and the peoples obedience: Their bondage to <HI>Babylon</HI> entred by their attention to prophets of their own and their non subjection to the prophets of God. <HI>2 Chron. 36.12, 15, 16.</HI> Hence that pathetical exclamation, <HI>Oh that my people had hearkned!</HI> Isa. 48.18, 19. Its not the least of our wilderness mercies, That from the beginning we have seen this union. Our good God hath neither suffered our teachers to be driven into corners, nor left them to run altogether in vain by shutting the door of faith where he hath open∣ed the door of utterance. This short testimony given forth by this watch∣full shepherd in so solemn an assembly from the Lord, there is another tryal whether the same faith &amp; faithfulness, which dwelt in our fathers in the first times of these plantations dwell in us, also their children. That God hath continued us yet in the mount of Gospel liberties, is through his grace out of Question. The spirit of Vnion, and the spirit of subjection to Gods order is most to be enquired after. Well! this is our present Test. This Sermon proceeded from the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> which our Lord Iesus <HI>hath</HI> put into the breast plate or heart of the speaker, that is faith and love:

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Or the time of <HI>Ieremiahs prophesying</HI> it is declared in <HI>Chap. 1.2, 3.</HI> Commencing in a manner with the time of that happy reformation of Gods worship, begun by good <HI>Iosiah</HI>▪ from the Idolatry and abominations found then in the Church of God: which will appear by comparing that key of the whole prophesie with <HI>2 Chron. 34.3.</HI> that holy and blessed King being (it is like) incouraged thereunto in a degree, by this great prophet of the Lord. Thus is Religion ever best established, and flourisheth when there is a concurrence of the Magistracy and Ministry together to pro∣mote the true worship of God, and to suppress what is contrary there∣unto.</P>
<P>These words contain the Lords solemn and affectionate expostula∣tion with his people, both as to the equity and goodness of his way toward them, and the Iniquity and Perverseness of their wayes to∣ward himself; wherein the Lord labours to recover the degenerating back-sliding people, shewing, (1) What he had been to them, <HI>viz.</HI> not a Wilderness, nor a Land of darkness. (2) What returns they had made unto the Lord, <HI>viz. Wherefore say my People,</HI> &amp;c. Particu∣larly observe: 1. The Compellation which is used, <HI>i. e. [O Gene∣ration.</HI>] 2.

<P>[<HI>O Generation</HI>] This word is sometimes taken for some certain sort or company of men whatsoever, <HI>Prov. 30.11, 12, 13.</HI> sometimes it hath respect to a Nation springing from such and such Ancestors, <HI>Judg. 2.10.</HI> and so in our Text; it betokens the persons in such an age succeeding their Fathers, who were in <HI>Jeremiahs</HI> time upon the stage of Action, <HI>Eccles. 1.4. One Generation passeth away and another Ge∣neration cometh,</HI> but the Earth (the great stage of Action, upon which all Generations are to act their part) abideth for ever: and so these in our Text were to endure and continue so long as until they had done the work of their Generations: and it is here also a degene∣rating Generation that is taxed (as <HI>Calvin</HI> notes) <HI>q. d.</HI> into what times are we fallen! what an age is this we live in! well, be it what it will be, yet <HI>O Generation hear</HI>! it was a strange generation that he is sent to speak unto, however he hath something to say to them.</P>

you, see this Word of the Lord in our Text, consider it, and remem∣ber what I say, do but open your eyes and you may behold the truth of what I am now putting you in minde of: <HI>q. d.</HI> look over your expe∣riences; mark the many signal, undeniable demonstrations of my being to you <HI>not a wilderness, nor</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>[<HI>Have I been a wilderness to Israel?</HI>] by <HI>Israel</HI> is meant the People of God in Covenant with him, his peculiar people: and this Que∣stion is to be understood in way of a strong Negation: <HI>the Lord had not been so to them,</HI> and the Lord so speaks as putting it to them them∣selves to be judge in the case: have I been so? do you consult your own experience, and let that make the answer, and the true answer must be, that assuredly I have not been a Wilderness to Israel; yet the expression doth imply or import at least their tacit and practical accu∣sation of the Lord that he had been so to them; and if they speak not so in Words, yet the Language of their hearts (which the Lord knew) and of their way (which others might observe) did betoken as much, and therefore the Lord here goes about to vindicate himself from such charge of any ungodly, unthankful murmurers in the Congregation of Israel: the Words are Metaphorical; <HI>Have I been a wilderness to Is∣rael?</HI> i. e. have I been that to my People which a Wilderness is unto men that are made to wilder therein, where they meet with nothing but wants, and terrour, and woe, &amp;c. and it may seem to allude to the state and condition of the Children of Israel in the Wilderness, of which there is speech, <HI>Deut.</HI> 8.2, 15. where the Lord led them forty years to humble them and to prove them, &amp;c called the <HI>great and ter∣rible wilderness, where were fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and Drought, &amp;c.</HI> called moreover, <HI>a waste howling wilderness.</HI> chap. 32.10▪ <HI>&amp;</HI> Jer. 2.6. described to be, <HI>a Land of Desarts, and Pits, a Land of Drought and of the Shadow of Death, a Land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt, and contradistinguished from the Land spoken of,</HI> ver. 7. <HI>a pleasant and a fruitful Land</HI>: There are these five things which we may consider of in a Wilderness,</P>
<P N="1">1. A Wilderness notes a desolate, solitary place, without Inhabi∣tant, and where there is nothing but confusion and disorder, <HI>Ier. 12 10. they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness</HI>: there's no man passing through, no man dwelling there, but it's deserted and forsaken of men, without that society and communion there that might else∣where be comfortably enjoyed: thus said the Lord, <HI>have I been so to you?

<P N="2">2. A Wilderness speaks a place uncultivated, a condition destitute of many necessary comforts, as aforesaid, there<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s suffering hunger and thirst, <HI>Psal. 107.4, 5.</HI> the Wilderness is not only a solitary way where no City is to dwell in, but they want meat and drink, and their soul faints within them, now have I been so to you, said the Lord! have I suffered you to want? as to outward bodily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood? have not I provi∣ded for you? the Lord fed his people in the Wilderness with Manna, bread from Heaven; and so likewise as to spiritual provision, and refre∣shing, have you found me streight-handed to you therein? when <HI>Iudah</HI> is removed away for their incorrigibleness in their sin to <HI>Babylon</HI> from the Sanctuary of God, because of their Sanctuary sins, we finde that called a Wilderness, <HI>Ezek. 19.13 Now she is planted in the Wilder∣ness, in a dry and thirsty ground</HI>; so was <HI>Babylon</HI> to the People of <HI>Iudah,</HI> without spiritual food for their souls, and they otherwise in great straits: Have I then (said the Lord) been as a barren Land to you, as an untill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and a fruitless soyle, that brings fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th nothing to those that come there for satisfaction or for their refreshing? have I been such, and so as that you could not finde a living with me? or as though it were more profitable to have served other Gods?</P>
<P N="3">3. In a Wilderness there is not a beaten path; whence it is that men there are in danger to be lost, and are made to wander about for want of a way before them wherein they might travail: <HI>context,</HI> v. 6. it is said to be a Land that no man passed through, and so here was no beaten road or plain path before them; have I been thus to you said the Lord? have I not made your way plain before you at all times, and passable, so that you have had direction and conduct from me? have not I led you in the right way? <HI>Psal. 107.7.</HI> have you been at a loss at any time, and I not near at hand to direct and counsel you? &amp;c. have you not heard a voice, as <HI>Ier. 30.21.</HI> saying, this is the way, when you have been ready to turn aside to the right hand or to the left?</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, in a wilderness there is not only want of many comforts, but there is danger as to many positive evils which such are exposed unto: Hence in the Scriptures before mentioned, the wilderness is said to be a land of pits &amp; fiery serpents; <HI>when Christ is in the wilderness he is

Have not I rather freed you from many temptations, and delivered you from the snares that many times have been laid for you by others? <HI>have I been as a waste howling wilderness, or as a devouring grave and pit of destruction to you</HI>?</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A wilderness is not hedged in, nor fenced about</HI>; what is in the wilderness hath no defence, but lies open to the injury of those that will break in to Bark the Trees thereof, and root up the same; the wilderness is no Inclosure, <HI>have I then been so to you</HI>? have I left you without defence, without an hedge of protection? <HI>have you not been as an inclosed garden to me, and I a wall of fire round about you</HI>? have not I given you those walls, such Defenders, Leaders, Instruments of safe∣ty, whereby you have been hedged about, walled in, and secured?</P>
<P>In summe, have I been unto you as such a place of terrours, and sorrows, and misery? a place which all men would fly from and depre∣cate? no, the Lord had not been so to them: yea, <HI>per Meiosin,</HI> hereby is meant that <HI>the Lord had been their glory by his presence, and a foun∣tain of living waters to them▪ and their salvation,</HI> however they had forsaken him:</P>

[<HI>we are Lords</HI>] in the Margent 'tis <HI>we have Dominion</HI>; so is the word also rendred in <HI>Gen. 27.40.</HI> i. e. <HI>after thou hast dominion, thou wilt break his yoak from off thy neck</HI>: &amp; truly thus was it with this people, when they gat power, having dominion over these and those, <HI>now they break off the Lord, yoake, and revolt from him,</HI> and therefore say (as it follows) <HI>we will come no more at thee</HI>: [RUD] [<HI>firmus fuit, innixut est firmiter, vires acquisivit, firmatus est, dominatus est] Avenarius</HI>) they thought they had strength, and were so firmly setled with a Rod or Scepter of power and sovereignty, that they needed not the Lord any more: though indeed they had received all from God: he had put upon them their ornaments, <HI>Ezek. 16.11, 12, 13.</HI> yet as if they had not received any such thing from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hand of God, they now despise the Lord, and in the pride and height of their spirits swell, and grow secure and lof∣ty, and cast off the fear of God: We have Kings and Princes, and Civil power and dignity, and therefore have no need of thee to be our Lord any longer, to be under his command, and so as to observe his or∣der, and keep the old Rode; but as <HI>1 Sam 8.7. Ier. 6.16.</HI> And we have power, and the Kingdome is setled in our hands: and we have things at command, we have peace and liberty, and are full, and in prosperity; and thus through their self-confidence and carnal Interests they are ready to look at themselves as absolute Lords, and so Independent: and we are from under thy authority; and are at our liberty: and we will have our liberty, are Lords of our own actions: and who may call us to an account; and we have dominion, and power as to others also our allies, in league and covenant with others, so that we are strong enough, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this question implies the unreasonableness of their Revolt from the Lord: wherefore <HI>&amp;c. q. d.</HI> there can be no rea∣son rendred for it, why they should thus forsake the Lord, and the good way which he hath led them in, and choose any other way; <HI>Context ver. 33.</HI> and <HI>36.</HI></P>

<P>Doct. <HI>That the undeniable experience which the Covenant-people of God have had of the Lords being to them not a wilderness nor a land of Darkness, but the contrary, should caution them never to incurre the guilt of so unreasonable a sin and dangerous folly, and provocation as to revolt from under the Lord, or to be unwilling to return again in case they have begun to decline from him.</HI> Mi. 6.3, 4.

<P><HI>R. 3</HI> From the excellency of <HI>Israel's</HI> God above all other Gods of the Nations, which gods yet these Nations will not ordinarily re∣ject: so that thus to cast off the Lord is that which is condemned by the very common Principles of such Nations in their way, though erring in respect of the right object of their devotion, <HI>Context ver. 10, 11.</HI> the Nations change not their Religion received from their Fathers, they will not part with their Gods though they be such as cannot save them in the day of their distress, they being Dunghil Gods; but the God of <HI>Israel</HI> is the true God, and our Fathers God (as the Covenant Relation speaks) and therefore we should never cast him off, <HI>Prov. 27.10.</HI> our Fathers Friend, &amp;c.

<P><HI>R. 4.</HI> From the Covenant Relation and Obligation of such a Peo∣ple unto God, to cleave for ever unto him: as the Lord on his part by performing his promise, fulfils his Covenant relation to them, and so gives them experience of his being no Wilderness or Land of Darkness to his People, so the consideration of the Covenant on their part super-added to that experience of the Lords faithfulness and goodness to them, which they have had, should be such a caution to them as the Doctrine intimates: Hence we are to put an Emphasis upon those words in the Text [<HI>My People</HI>] wherefore say my People, &amp;c. <HI>q. d.</HI> this will be contrary to those solemn ingagements whereby they have bound themselves to me for ever to fear me and love me, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there∣fore in context, <HI>ver. 2.</HI> the Lord puts them in mind of their espousals to him: and hence also vide <HI>Calvinum</HI> in <HI>ver. 20.</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Vse. 1. Hence the People of God should not suffer their Experiences of the Lords being to them not a Wilderness or a Land of Darkness in this good Land which he hath given them to dye and perish with them, but ought to preserve and improve them for this end, that they might be kept thereby from casting off their subjection and obedience unto the Lord their God</HI>; Psal 106.12, 13. they did not so religiously retain the memorial of the Lords doings as they should: and as <HI>Mat. 16.9.</HI> so are we apt to forget wonders of mercy.

the Lord hath herein moulded and formed us to such a consistency therein, as both friends and enemies have wondred at. The Lord hath not left things to a Wilderness confusion, but there hath been that beau∣ty of order which he hath stamped on this People respecting the Do∣ctrine, and way of Worship here professed, and in the due subordina∣tion of Superiours, and Inferiours, and fellowship of the servants of God together in the Lord: That order and fellowship in the Gospel, and communion, both with the Lord and one another; O how sweet hath

that Communion of Saints been! the Lord hath made his People to be as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is compact together, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.3, 4. and so have not been left to be as a Wilderness wherein no man dwells, or as the Land of Darkness, <HI>Job. 10. ult. where no order is</HI>; but here the Lord hath set up his Tabernacle, and that where the Devil hath been sometime open∣ly and publickly worshipped &amp;c, he hath spirited his Servants here to associate together according to his order, with a desire to observe all the Ordinances of the Lord Jesus, and to reject the mixtures of hu∣mane inventions in the Worship of God, contrary to the second Commandment: <HI>the Lord filled his Servants with a zeal for the House of God (in all the forms and ordinances thereof, as</HI> Ezek. 43.10, 11, 12.) such a zeal had Christ, <HI>Ioh. 2.17.</HI> the zeal whereof did even eat him up; and it was <HI>Phineas</HI> his zeal which did quench the fire of Gods wrath that began to burn against Israel, and so, on the contrary, our cold∣ness, our luke-warmness, will kindle the fire of his displeasure. Hence also was it the care which God put into the hearts of the first Genera∣tion that planted this Wilderness (that so this land might not be a land of darkness and wilderness, as aforesaid) to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovide Nurseries for Church and Common-wealth, in their ordering Schools of Learning, and in particular the Colledge; whence it may be said of our <HI>New-England Cambridge</HI> also, as of old, <HI>Hinc lucem, &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cula sacra</HI>! where∣by light and refreshing (as from a Fountain of Blessing) might be communicated to the whole land, by a constant supply of a godly, learned Magistracy and Ministry (persons fitted for publick service both in Church and Common-wealth) and we have had experience of the blessing of God upon that endeavour: and O let no hand there∣fore be suffered to lay the Axe of destruction to the root of that Tree, by any direct or indirect means, or to draw away those influences from above or beneath, which tend to its flourishing and increasing!</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Provision which the Lord hath made for his People of Food and Comforts for Soul and Body; he hath turned a Wilderness into a fruitful field, which we have admirable experience of also: hath he not liberally provided for us, to encourage us in his service? the Lord hath opened his good hand, and given us bountifully as to out∣ward blessings, in so much that we have been able to relieve and sup∣port other Plantations of the <HI>English</HI> in other parts of the World, and have had the blessings of peace, while others have been wasted with War; &amp; liberty to be holy without restraint from man, and as 2 <HI>Sam 7.9, 10.</HI> so may I turn it as to <HI>New-England,</HI> God hath given it a name


<PB N="12" REF="000182_0016_0FA3155B453B85F8"/>
like the name of the great Nations of the Earth; and hath planted his people in a place of their own, and in the place which he hath chosen for them, to set his name in: and though some came hither but with their staff as <HI>Iacob, yet are they now become many bands</HI>; and God hath sown the land up and down abundantly with the seed of man and beast: he hath blessed the bread and water of his people, and hath unto won∣derment divers times cast in supplies of food and cloathing, in the first planting of this wilderness by his people, which things are not to be forgotten; <HI>the Lord hath not left himself without witness, but hath given us rain from Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. as <HI>Acts 14.17.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to Direction; making the way of his people plain before them: they have not been left to such a wilderness state as wherein to find no path beaten out for them, but the Lord himself hath been lead∣ing them in a plain path when they have had many observers; being to them for a glorious conduct, even as by <HI>a Pillar of fire and cloud</HI> hath he shewed them the way: Hence it is that God also hath given to his people those that might be as eyes to them in the wilderness. <HI>Numb. 10.31.</HI> persons eminently furnished with his spirit, to be in∣strumental of the prosperity of this place respecting the civil and Church-state: not only Artificers mechannical (and it is well if their skill dye not with them, for want of those that should have been instructed as apprentices under them) the Lord sowed this land at first with such precious seed-corn, as was pickt out of our whole Nation: and not only so, but also men that have been accomplished to move in an higher sphear, in whom much of the spirit of God hath dwelt, wise-hearted for the erecting of the Tabernacle of God. <HI>Exod. 31.3, 4, 5, 6.</HI> filled with wisdom and heavenly skill for government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such holy ones as have had an excellent portion of that divine <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI>; whereby this land hath been preserved from being turned again to <HI>a land of darkness</HI>: 'twas part of <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> complaint in <HI>2 Chron. 29.7.</HI> that in the time of <HI>Ahaz</HI> his Father <HI>they had put out the Lamps of the Sanctuary</HI> (and what follows <HI>but darkness in the Sanctuary when the lamps are put out</HI>) but the Lord hath lighted them and set them up here with us: the Lord hath gloriously cleared up his will and counsel to his people, respecting the doctrine and worship of the Gospel, whereof they have given that Testimony in the Platform of Discipline, declar∣ing therein their hearty assent and attestation to <HI>the Confession of Faith agreed upon by the Reverend Assembly of Divines at</HI> Westminster <HI>in matters of Doctrine</HI>; only in some few points of controversie in Church

<P N="4">4. As to the Lords delivering his people from snares laid for them, pits which they have been in danger to fall into, and might have peri∣shed in, and wild beastly men that would have devoured them; the Bear that <HI>would have rooted up this Vineyard of the Lord,</HI> as <HI>Psal 80.13.</HI> and from such <HI>that as ravening Wolves, but in Sheeps cloathing, would have wurried or scattered the Lords flock, if himself had not wrought for us</HI>: some as Foxes which the Lord hath ordered to be taken that they might not eat up the Vine and the tender Grapes, <HI>Cant. 2.15.</HI> when as his people have been tender and weak, and might have been easily crushed, peeled, laid waste, &amp;c. then did the Lord stir up a spirit of courage, and wisdome, and zeal, and faithfulness in our godly Leaders to take those Foxes so full of subtilty and mischief, that would else have destroyed his Vineyard, and that by plucking off its buds and ten∣der Grapes; the Lord hath not suffered that brood of the Serpent to increase here, as otherwise would have been: we should have been filled with poysonful, fiery, stinging Serpents, if the Lord had not sea∣sonably prevented the same, by the effectual crushing the same in the very Egg: hath not the Lord blessed the coercive power of the Civil Magistrate for that end? let our experience give in evidence: In the case of the <HI>Heresie of the Familists,</HI> which brake out of old among us; aad O to what a height they suddenly grew! working at length woful disturbance in the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil State as well as in the Churches, this is not to be forgotten; as tame as Error for a time pretended to be, yet at length it could gird it self with a Sword, but the Lord would not suffer it to be drawn. So likewise after this, with reference to the <HI>Gortonists,</HI> &amp;c. which things should be remembred for ever, and the mercy of the Lord acknowledged, in that he preserved us from those Hornets also, and that Ministerially by our Rulers spirited by himself thereunto.</P>
<P>And it is to be hoped, that this coercive power of a godly Magistracy, which we have experienced the benefit of so many wayes, being due∣ly managed, shall not be abandoned (distinguishing alwayet notwith∣standing between the Magistrates

Religion for the defence and maintaining the Gospel among us; or that liberty shall be proclaimed to men of any Religion to come and set up Shops or Schools of Seduction among us; or to those of such a perswasion, and way of false worship, as in the general experience of the Churches of Christ since the reformation, hath proved, where ever their Opinions have prevailed, ruinous to the Churches of Christ, and destructive to the Souls of men, to draw them from the acknowledge∣ment of the Covenant of God, and so of the truth and order of the Gospel: Hence therefore, as when a man is overtaken with an High∣way Robber, and for a time holds some discourse with him, if he finde him to be such an one as hath robbed others, he is very unwise that will throw away his Sword, though at present he hath no occasion to make use of it: there may be a connivance for a time, in case of necessity (which yet I hope, is not our own case) when notwithstanding there's no need of an open, publick, professed Declaration, that Errour shall be tolerated: To tolerate all things, and to tolerate nothing (it's an old and true Maxime) both are intolerable: but 'tis Satan's policy, to plead for an indefinite and boundless toleration, as <HI>Chemnitius</HI> excel∣lently shews from those Words, <HI>Mark 1.24 [Let us alone] Har∣mon,</HI> chap. 37. pag. 388, 389 he calls it <HI>Diabolica Machinatio in conciliationibus Religionum, i. e.</HI> Christ may have his Kingdome, if he will let Satan alone with his, and so both of them live lovingly and quietly together.</P>
<P N="5">5. As to Protection, that wall of defence that God hath granted to his People; God himself hath been a Wall of fire to us, and hath wrought wonderfully for us in the years of the right hand of the most High that are past, our very Enemies being Judges: the Lord hath in∣closed us, set an hedge about his people as about <HI>Job,</HI> and all that he had, <HI>he hath fenced us,</HI> Isai. 5.2. <HI>and walled us about, as his peculiar gar∣den of pleasure, wherein he hath retired himself</HI> from the noise, and tu∣mults, and disturbance of the World, &amp;c. And though this place (as a Wilderness) hath been a place at times, of some temptation as that Wilderness, <HI>Mat. 4.1.</HI> to Christ, and that his People have tempted the Lord, saying, <HI>Can the Lord provide Bread for us here</HI>? there have been the <HI>Massahs</HI> and <HI>Meribahs: (O that they had never been heard of in this Wilderness! and that it might not have been told in Gath, &amp;c</HI>! and the Lord hath proved and tryed his People above forty years together, yet (blessed be his Name!) they have had his gracious presence as a Pillar of Protection with them; not only for a guid, but a guard also to them:


<PB N="15" REF="000182_0019_0FA3155D86CD3600"/>
and as to Tryals by Sea and Land, by Seducers, and Underminers, and bold Demanders, &amp;c. we may say as <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.11. <HI>But out of them all the Lord delivered us</HI>! the Lord hath had pity on his peoples weakness, and notwithstanding frowardness in his Children when they have been sometimes under temptation, yet hath he shewed himself a patient and good God, <HI>Act. 13.18. [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] vide Mar∣ginem,</HI> as a Nurse beareth, or feedeth her Childe, so the Lord hath graci∣ously born our manners, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And so as to all that light, and glory, and distinguishing goodness, fa∣vour and blessing which the Lord hath vouchsafed unto his People, to∣gether with his blessing those means of his appointment, wherewith he hath crowned us, blessing the Ministry of the Word, the Administra∣tion of the Keyes and of the Seals of the Kingdome of Heaven for the salvation of his People; blessing the order of Councils, and Sy∣nods as there hath been occasion: I say we have found the Lord (experi∣mentally) blessing his People in this way: hath it not been so? will not our experience witness for God? and give in abundant evidence of these things? in the Time of the <HI>Opinions, so called</HI>? O call to remem∣brance those times, you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old Generation; how notably did the Lord, in the way of <HI>Council of Churches,</HI> by that <HI>famous Synod then met at Cambridge,</HI> free this wilderness from being <HI>a land of darkness</HI> by seasonably dispelling that hellish damp, and mist of errours and he∣resy! Again, when these Churches lay under the reproach of Schisme, or rigid separation from the Churches in <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c▪ as is to be seen in the preface to the platform of Discipline: and when some great ones there had said, <HI>fieri non posse ut Zelotes isti in unam eeclesiastica politias formam (ne si optio quidem daretur) communi inter se consensu unquam conspirare velint.</HI> &amp;c: this (<HI>as Reverend and worthy Mr. Cotton of blessed memory</HI> speaks in his Epistle before <HI>Mr. Norton's</HI> answer to <HI>Apollonius</HI>) was presently removed also by means of another Synod, which did from the word of God draw up the platform of Discipline, Characteristicall of the way of these Churches, with admirable consent and Harmony: other experiences I might instance of the singular smiles of God upon that ordinance of Council; Honoured, and belov∣ed in the Lord, let none baffle you out of your experiences had of these things: and accordingly O that still we may, as thereis need, experience the like benediction!</P>

<P>Be much in the serious meditation of what the Lord hath done this way, lay up, and look over those experiences we have had of the Lords wonderful working for us from the time of the laying of the <HI>Corner∣stone</HI> of this plantation unto this day: and O let there not be a removing of the <HI>Ancient Land-marks of this Interest of Jesus Christ</HI>; not but that God reserv's to each generation their work in the advances of Re∣formation, as <HI>Phil. 3.12.—16.</HI> and as hitherto we have ex∣perienced the concurrence of both Magistracy and Ministry, as so choice a means under God of our preservation in the enjoyment of our liber∣ties civil and sacred, so let it be the studious endeavour of those in whose hearts are the ways of God, that that concurrence may still hold, and that the Governours of this <HI>Iudah,</HI> i. e Leaders, both civil and Ecclesiastical may say that the people of God are their strength in the Lord their God, <HI>Zech. 12.5.</HI> and so that three-fold cord of Ma∣gistrates, Ministers and people shall not be easily broken: and as <HI>Ne. 10 28, 29.</HI> with <HI>Ezra. 10.4.</HI> so that the good people of this Land would say to those that are set over them in the Lord (and to whom their hearts should be cleaving) by way of encourageing of them, arise, this and that belongeth unto you, and we will be with you! O that both Magistracy, Ministry &amp; the people might be perswaded unto that union and concurrence, especially in the matters of God and his wor∣ship according to the exhortation which hath in former times been excellently given us from <HI>Haggi. 2.4.</HI> and truly when we look upon

the primitive constitution of this people, me-think's the Lord repre∣sents himself as to the Prophet <HI>Amos, cha. 7.7.</HI> as standing upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand, admirably and happily squaring, disposing, cementing together the spiritual stones of this building: as to the union and conspiration of the parts thereof, severally in their order to strengthen and beautifie the whole, O how excellent was it, as those of the first generation yet remaining know, and many also of the rising generation can Remember. Here let me say, <HI>O generation see the Word of the Lord in this matter also</HI>: the Lord gave his servants in Church and Common wealth for the main body of them an uniting spirit, and so a spirit of Communion for the carry∣ing on with one mind, with one lip, and with one shoulder the King∣dom of Christ, and the work of their generation; in which respects he was to them <HI>not a wilderness nor a land of darkness.</HI> Union of Refor∣mers was their beauty and their strength. Then might be seen,</P>
<P N="1">1. Magistrates, and Magistrates upon the seat of justice cemented together for the advancement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ in this wilderness; they lookt not upon themselves as unconcerned in matters of Religion; but accordingly also have they thence-forward at all times as there was occasion put forth their power that way; <HI>for they are called Gods,</HI> and therefore knew they were to have a care of Godli∣ness, that being set by God in highest place, they should not set God &amp; his Interest lowest; but as <HI>David, prefer</HI> Jerusalem <HI>above their chief joy,</HI> Psal. 137.6. that being Gods they are to love what God love's and hate what God hates, even as is spoken to the commendation of the Church of <HI>Ephesus.</HI> Rev. 2.6. <HI>Thou hatest the deeds of the</HI> Nicolaitans <HI>which thing I also hate</HI>: Hence see <HI>Davids</HI> spirit, <HI>Psa. 139.21, 22.</HI> &amp; <HI>132.1, 2, 3.</HI> &amp; this power of the Magistrate in matters of Religion hath been asserted by our first Leaders, by those in the Common-wealth, as ap∣pears by their constant practice; and also by those in the Churches, witness the writings <HI>of our famous Divines now at rest with God</HI> Mr. Cotton <HI>bloody tenet washed.</HI> Mr. Hooker <HI>Survey pt. 2. pag. 79.80.

<Q>If once you take your selves to have no∣thing to do as Rulers for Christ, you cannot promise your selves that Christ will have any thing to do for you as Rulers in a way of mercy▪ and this (saith he) Mr. <HI>Owen</HI> (so then stiled) hath lately told you in


<PB N="28" REF="000182_0032_0FA3158998BFF3E8"/>
his Sermon, <HI>Octob. 13. viz.</HI> The God of Heaven forbid that ever all the Devils in hell, the Jesuits at <HI>Rome,</HI> or the seduced souls in <HI>England</HI> should be able to perswade the Rulers of this Land, who are so deeply bound to God by vows, mercies, professions, and high expences of treasure and blood, to reform his Church, and pro∣pagate his Gospel: that now after all this it belongeth not to them, but they must, As Rulers be no more for Christ then for <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>: But if ever it should prove the sad case of <HI>England</HI> to have such Rulers (which I strongly hope will never be) if my prognosticks fail not, this will be their fate, The Lord Jesus will forsake them as they have forsaken him, and the prayers of his Saints will be fully turn'd against them: and his elect shall cry to him night and day <HI>till he avenge them speedily,</HI> by making these his enemies <HI>to lick the dust, and dashing them in pieces like a potters vessel, because they would not that he should reign over them</HI>: and then they shall know whether Christ be not <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Then might be seen Magistrates and Ministers together in way of advice (I exclude not here <HI>the honoured Deputies of the general Court,</HI> but) I here intend the agreement that there was between the civil and and Ecclesiastical Leaders in matters of difficulty, or of weight, and that were of general and common concernment to Churches or Com∣mon wealth▪ those at the helm of the civil state were wont to make use of the Ministry; and the Ministry again of the Magistrates, as there was like occasion <HI>in re communi</HI>: nor were they wont to go con∣trary to each others advice, but had these candid arguings one with another, if they did seem to differ in any thing at any time, as whereby a right understanding mutually was obtained: and often have they found the blessing of God upon them in this way, both in the first set∣ling of this Colony and after its constitution, both in the Legislative and Executive parts of government, and therein in special providing against an Arbitrary government: and I hope it will ever be the wis∣dom, faithfulness, and care of this civil Authority not to leave behind them presidents of Arbitrary rule; for if it be left unto meer judge∣ment and conscience without prescript Law, then do but change the persons that are to judge, and there will be tyranny and woe, and confusion enough consequential thereunto: and that Land which be∣fore by wholsom Laws did, and might have continued to shine most gloriously, will soon be turned <HI>into utter darkness,</HI> where there will be nothing heard but <HI>weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</HI> And as


<PB N="29" REF="000182_0033_0FA31589C6FB6A20"/>
formerly so still there should be communication of advice, intentions, and endeavours mutually between those that are in these two orders. <HI>Josiah</HI> doth not disdain to take advice of <HI>Huldah</HI> the Prophetess. <HI>2. Chron. 34.20, 21, 22. Nathan the Prophet</HI> doubts not to say (<HI>1. Kin. 1.27.</HI>) unto <HI>David [Is this thing done by my Lord the King, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should fit on the throne of my Lord the King after him?] Moses and Aaron kiss one another in the mount of God</HI>; Exod. 4.27. <HI>Moses</HI> (Israels Ruler) fare's the better for taking the advice of <HI>Iethro</HI> the Priest of <HI>Midian,</HI> Exod. 18.1, 18, 24. and so did all Israel prosper under it. It went well with <HI>Ioash</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> while they hearkned to <HI>Iehoiada</HI>: and experience hath, and will discover it to be true that, in all states neither do well asunder, or divided estrang∣edly in their counsels. Again, then might be seen;</P>
<P N="3">3. Ministers, and Ministers cleaving together in way of communi∣on; nothing that was difficult, or questionable, or Weighty, or New, or that had an influence upon the whole, but they were wont to consult with one another; as I have heard from divers of the ancient Ministers of Christ now with God, and when I was a Child have observed in my Fathers house: if there hapned to be some mis-understanding at any time, it was reasoned out placidly, and still Ministerial communion was maintained; and these things are known unto hundreds yet living that may remember the Ministers meetings, in the several Towns by course, as at <HI>Cambridge, Boston, Charlstown, Roxbury,</HI> &amp;c. when, and where the people did with great joy, and reverence acknowledge them and their labours that way for the good of the Churches: respectively, and looked upon them as Angels of God, and so received them when they came to Town: <HI>Paul's</HI> spirit was then eminently breathing amongst them, <HI>viz.</HI> as to the care of all the Churches. <HI>2. Cor. 11.28.</HI> and the Apostles word then remarkably observed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>1.

<P N="4">4. Then might be seen Ministers and their respective Congregati∣ons together; their People trembling at the Word of God delivered by them, reverencing them in the Lord, esteeming them highly for their work sake, subjecting to their power and rule in the Lord: and so now also may we build upon that Word of God, <HI>2 Chron. 20.20.</HI> (if it is not antiquated and now out of date) <HI>i. e.</HI> Hear me O! <HI>Judah, and Ye Inhabitants of this Land, Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established, believe his Prophets, so shall you prosper</HI>; as you love

your souls, and your Childrens also, I beseech you for the Lords sake, be not apt to imbibe evil reports and scandals against them, to cause jealousie and prejudice in your hearts, the rule in <HI>1 Tim. 5.19.</HI> is known: had it been attended, most of our troubles had been prevented:</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>The Prophets are divided</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. So they were of old. 2. This Rule in <HI>Timothy,</HI> and that word in <HI>2 Chron. 20.</HI> aforesaid, hold good still. 3.

<P N="5">5. Then might be seen <HI>Churches, and Churches together in way of Communion,</HI> by greater <HI>Synods,</HI> as hath been before intimated, and also in lesser <HI>Synods</HI> or <HI>Councills,</HI> as there hath been occasion when any Church hath <HI>wanted light</HI> or <HI>peace</HI> &amp;c. If help were not asked, it was sent them without asking: and it was not then accounted an <HI>infring∣ment of the Liberty of Churches</HI> so to do: I apprehend it might do well and be of great use, if a <HI>Memoriall</HI> thereof were published for posteri∣ty; that there might be an <HI>History &amp; Narrative</HI> of each of them; and a signification of the blessing of God upon the advice of Elders, and messengers of Churches met in Council, in the many Towns of the Country, Melting hearts, and drawing tears both of joy and repentance from the eyes of brethren in those daies of their reconciliation, &amp;c. and an evil spirit therefore in any is that, who are labouring to keep breaches open by refusing <HI>balm to be poured in for healing,</HI> when the Physitian also is at hand in <HI>Gilead</HI>: &amp; oh how terrible is it to see the body of Jesus Christ (for so is the Church called) <HI>torn in sunder by divisions</HI>! sure that is not the true Mother that would have the Child divided: what are men doing when they thus divide but incurring that guilt and penalty, <HI>Gal. 5 13.</HI> and are they not eating every one the flesh of his own arm? for so they might be an arm of strength to one another when united: and I hope our godly Leaders will not suffer it to be so, that two or three men shall continue to disturb the peace of a whole Congregation, and hinder the settlement of the Gospel, and Ordinan∣ces of Christ from year to year! is there no redress for this? if you saw a company of men set, and resolved to vex and starve one another bodily, should it be suffered? let the liberty of Churches be preserved, but care continued for conversion of those that are out of the Church visible, and therefore such as are able, appointed, and encouraged to preach the Word there constantly, till they can agree, either to choose him, or some other faithful Steward of the mysteries of God among

them. But let <HI>Sister-Churches</HI> in the mean time not be careless and negligent respecting their duty of Communion also. Finally then might be seen,</P>
<P N="6">6. Magistrates, Ministers, and their people together, strengthening the hands of one another in God; even according to that exhortatory speech, <HI>Haggai 2.4.</HI> And indeed it is Gods work to make his fear fall upon the hearts of men, so as to stand in awe of, and reverence Authori∣ty (<HI>1 Sam. 11.7.</HI>) and so of the wholsome Laws in a state that are made: and if God do not this, if he bow not their hearts thereunto, all will be in vain: a notable spirit of self-denyal, love, courage, zeal for the interest of Christ in the publick, was at first breathing among this people and was crowned from heaven with glorious success by the God of our mercy: and O let not these experienced ways of blessing be for∣gotten, or despised, or departed from by this people!</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, that a revolt from God is usually graduated, having its more imperceptible beginnings: by degree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the souls of men slide back from God. Satan hath variety of artifices whereby to cast us down, and overthrow the true Religion and Kingdom of Christ among us, if he could; he make's use of the Divisions, and Scandals of Gods people to promote his hellish designs: he will improve the spirit of fear and cowardice in some; the rashness of others: the jealousies of others: the ambition of others: the covetousness of others: the sim∣plicity of others: the passions of others: the sheepishness of others: <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to advance his own cause in the Apostacy of professours: yea, and mis∣chief (perhaps) shall be laid in, in the very primmers for children whereby they may even suck in poison in their tender years: &amp; also in the pictures and images of Christ, of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and other canoni∣zed popish Saints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sold in some shops, or brought over among us: things that will take with children, but though they may seem <HI>minute,</HI> yet will surely prove of dangerous consequence at length to those tender years, and may become an Introduction to Popery it self. I wish such things might be crushed in the egge, and abandoned by every one that professeth the Christian name, <HI>for the Lord thy God,</HI> O <HI>New-England is a jealous God! he is a jealous Husband</HI> especially in the matters of the second Commandment.

<P N="1">1. Forgetting a wilderness condition▪ their's danger thereof, <HI>when turned to a fruitful field.</HI> Deut. 8.11, 14▪ 18, 19. but therefore read <HI>Deut. 26.5.—Isa. 51.1.</HI>—&amp;c.</P>

<P N="5">5▪ Glutting themselves with the things of the world, and hence loathing, or weariness of Ordinances, and so dispensing with them, I say dispensing with them; Dispensations with Gods commands are many

<P N="6">6. Decay and want of the spirit of faith and holiness, whence to get, and keep an experimental savour of the sweetness of Iesus Christ, and his precious ways, and hence follow's a falling away from any ex∣ternal profession of the true Religion.</P>
<P N="7">7. The backslidings of some few, and they (notwithstanding) countenanced by too many, whereby they become hardned in their evil way, and infection also spreads the more. Familiar fellowship with excommunicate persons was one of those <HI>ulcera Ecclesiae</HI> which <HI>our famous</HI> Cotton sadly complains of under that very term, as also Re∣miss silence in the sounder members against the offensive expressions of the unsound, was another of them which he bewailed.</P>

greatly threateneth our welfare; and this begins both wayes strangely, and strongly to lift up it self by reason of the a∣verseness that there is in so many against faithful, plain, zealous and thorough condemning the sins of the times we live in: The Mini∣stry must not bear witness against sin, nor the Magistrate; even as though men would thus stop the mouthes of the Witnesses of Jesus Christ, and slay them by such a political death: it is a great sin, and a dangerous evil to make a man an offender for a word in the sense of <HI>Isai. 29.21.</HI> and to lay a snare for him that reproveth in the Gate.</P>

of his will: and that we have found the Lord setting to his seal of Di∣vine benediction thereunto, O take we heed of Innovations now▪ and let the remembrance of what the Lord hath been to us and done for us recover from every degree of, and all tendencies unto backsliding! and in special here.</P>
<P N="1">1. Remember that a main design of Gods people's adventuring in to this wilderness was for progress in the work of Reformation, and that in the way of brotherly communion with the Reformed Churches of Christ in other parts of the world. O forsake not, deny not, con∣demn not that fundamental design! and otherwise indeed what needed they to have removed from <HI>England</HI>? (this cannot justly be denyed) they were then in the place from whence there came mixtures in the worship of God, and the blessed Sabbath of God struck at, &amp;c. which there were grieved with, <HI>and vexed their righteous souls from day to day</HI>; but here they hoped they might enjoy freedom from those pollutions, <HI>and freedom to follow the Lord fully in all his Ordinances and appoint∣ments</HI>; I say <HI>to follow the Lord</HI> (not by halves: not still in way of mix∣tures in Religion to have a medly of all sorts of Religion, but) <HI>fully</HI>; with what purity the Lord would give them light for, and power to enjoy without molestation: And therefore, as not in a way of Separation from the Churches of Christ in <HI>Old-England,</HI> which the printed Books of our <HI>New-England</HI> Divines do abundantly shew; (<HI>v. Cottons Answer to</HI> Mr. <HI>Williams.</HI> pag. 138.140, <HI>&amp;c. Hookers Survey, pt. 1. pag. 48.</HI> Mr. <HI>Philips in his Answer to Lamb.</HI> pag. 144. Mr. <HI>Allen of</HI> Dedham, <HI>with my Honoured Father (P. M.) in their defence of the nine positions both in the Preface,</HI> pag. 12, 13. and afterward in that Book, <HI>p. 40.43, 68, 70, 71, 150.</HI> &amp;c.) And so to hold communion with them in the Ordinances of Christ, and according to the order and com∣mand of Christ, yet withal to depart from defiling mixtures aforesaid; Surely then it follows by undenyable consequence, that if it was for Reformation, then not for Toleration of all Religions: and awful are the words that fell from the pen <HI>of our famous Cotton in his bloody tenet washed,</HI> (pag. 132. and 192) <HI>viz.</HI>
It was Toleration that made the world <HI>Anti-Christian</HI>: and (<Q><HI>said he) the Church never took hurt by the punishment of Hereticks. But in the page last mentioned he hath these words,</HI> i. e. The Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whores cup, lest while we seem to detest &amp; reject her with open face of pro∣fession, we do not bring her in by a back door of Toleration &amp; so come at

<P>And shall any now plead for mixtures of <HI>men's superstitious In∣ventions</HI> in the <HI>worship of God</HI>? &amp; what else is the Spirit of that <HI>Tolera∣tion,</HI> which many cry up; but that no thorough &amp; effectual Testimony should be born against such <HI>Idolatrous mixtures</HI>? The hearty love and union of a truely Religious people, consists not in a boundless <HI>toleration of sin,</HI> but in the way of <HI>Reformation,</HI> Ezek. <HI>11.18, 19.</HI> And should this poor people be intoxicated with that <HI>heady wine</HI> of the Doctrine of such a <HI>toleration,</HI> as to open that door [for instance] unto <HI>superstitious and anti christian Ceremonies</HI> in the worship of God, as it would be contrary to our professed Fundamental end of the setling of this Plantation, so God would be extreamly provoked at such a toleration: and who sees not the event that would be? the like I might say as to any other such mixtures brought in by to∣leration destructive to the established way of Worship here, for the substance thereof: and shall this be the commendation of New-England, <HI>i. e. [I have somthing for thee, that thou canst bear with them that are evil?</HI>] and this for thee [<HI>that thou sufferest the wo∣man</HI> Jezabel <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Yea why do not men plead for <HI>Toleration</HI> of all <HI>non-fundamentals</HI> in Civil matters? for there are the <HI>extra-fundamentalia</HI> there also.</P>
<P>Let the Magistrates <HI>Coercive Power</HI> in matters of Religion [there∣fore] be still asserted, seing he is one who is bound to God, more then any other men, to cherish his true Religion; and as the good Kings of Judah, commended for it in Scripture, <HI>Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Iosiah &amp;c.</HI> therefore are they to be principal Instruments in furthering the Reformation aforesaid: and I would leave it with any godly, sober Christian to consider and answer; Whether the <HI>Interest of Religion</HI> hath not as good a title, and plea for the Ma∣gistrates Protection, as [not any irreligion which self conceit and humor hath wedded any unto; but] any worldly Interest whatso∣ever? and how wofull would the state of things soon be among us, if men might have liberty without controll, to profess or preach or print, or publish what they list, tending to the Seduction of others! and though the <HI>Enemy soweth Tares,</HI> which cannot be ma∣ny times plucked up without danger to the wheat, and are there∣fore let alone, yet I would hope none of the Lords husbandmen


<PB N="39" REF="000182_0043_0FA3159146C17A18"/>
will be so foolish as to <HI>Sow Tares,</HI> or plead for the Sowing of them, I mean in the way of the Toleration aforesaid, when as it may be prevented: the light of Nature and right Reason would cry out against such a thing.</P>

<PB N="40" REF="000182_0044_0FA31592049B88F0"/>
more power (as a Master) then he had before his conversion; but yet surely the grace of God bestowed upon him, teacheth him, that he is bound to improve his power better (for the advancement of the inte∣rest of Religion in his family, and curbing irreligion therein) even far beyond what he did before his conversion, so 'tis here with the conver∣ted Magistrate.</P>
<P><HI>Austin</HI> I finde speaking to this objection, That in the primitive times, the civil Magistrate did not make and execute such Laws, and put forth their coercive power for Religion and the Chri∣stians; <HI>Answers it thus,</HI> viz.
<Q><HI>They consider not that that was the time wherein (as in</HI> Psal. 2.) <HI>it is predicted that the Kings and Gentiles</HI> would rage, <HI>&amp;c. and not then the time for what follows there also foretold, to be afterward accomplished, that Kings should serve the Lord in fear, &amp;c.</HI> Nondum autem agebatur quod paulo post in eodem Psalmo dicitur, <HI>i. e.</HI> &amp; nunc Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s intelligite, &amp;c.

<P>'Tis not enough, saith he, that Kings do serve the Lord as private men can do, but <HI>as Kings,</HI> and that is when they do that in his service for him which none but Kings (&amp; so it holds as to other inferiour Magistrates pro∣portionably) can do; as respecting the making &amp; executing wholsome Laws, in order to the advancement of the Kingdome of Christ) (<HI>Au∣gustinus Bonifacio comiti, de correctione Donatistarum propter eos qui nole∣bantillos legibus imperialibus corrigi, tomo, 2. pag.</HI> 74.)

in matters of Religion, is a mercy to be prayed for, <HI>1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</HI> &amp; there∣fore surely is no anti-Christian thing, as some would suggest; yea, saith the Apostle in the same Epistle, <HI>Chap. 1.9, 10. Knowing that the Law is not made for a righteous man,</HI> (i. e. that he should be condemned and punished for his righteousness) <HI>but for the Lawless and Disobedient [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp;c.] i. e. that will not be subject to Order,</HI> as the word notes; <HI>and for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ungodly and unholy &amp; prophane, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine,</HI> so that not only as to matters of unrighteousness against the second Table, but ungodliness and un∣holiness against the first Table, is the Law to be proportionably shar∣pened: so that therefore if those that call themselves pious, will carry it impiously, and lawlesly, treading upon the wholsome Laws of the Country, and so upon Authority it self, and will refuse to subject unto Christs order, and do what is scandalous and criminal, let them smart for it as well as those that make not such a profession of Religion: as on the other hand, such should be the constitution of Civil Govern∣ment, as that ungodly men also may have Justice when their Cause is good, as sometimes it is: a bad man may have a good cause which he is engaged in, and on the other side, a godly man may be found in a cause that is exceeding vile, and the uprightness of the Civil Judge will carry him impartially to minde the cause, and not (in that respect) the person:</P>
<P>Let all Prophaness (then) in Doctrine, and Life, that causeth di∣sturbance of the Peace of Churches, or of the Common-wealth be curbed, the Rod of the Magistrate is effectually to be improved for that end: And the Lord mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and more strengthen the hand and heart of our Magistracy to crush all Prophaness, the Pride, and Drunkenness, and Whoredome, and Lying, and Stealing, the Heresies, and Schismes, and Factions, and such works of the Flesh, and scandalous Disorders that do so lamentably prevail among us; whether these works of the flesh (as the Apostle calls them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.) he found in Church mem∣bers or Non-members.</P>

Nor let there be any <HI>Ludibria medicorum Spiri∣tualium,</HI> or what may be any standing Reproach to the Healing wayes and Instruments of Jesus Christ here, seeing there is sufficient <HI>Balm in Gilead</HI> provided by Christ for every <HI>Spiritual Disease</HI> in his <HI>Church.</HI> Let not the way of the <HI>Rigid Separatists,</HI> and the like, he acted over again here, till the Churches be buried in Confusion. In case of the <HI>Divisions in Churches,</HI> hath not the <HI>Congregational-Way</HI> Balm for this Wound appointed by Christ, but <HI>Morellius</HI> must be raked out of his grave to be the onely Physician?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let the Ministry</HI> (who also should be instrumental, in their Sphere, to keep this Land from becoming <HI>a land of darkness) be duely Encouraged.</HI> There have been, and are Complaints this way respect∣ing their outward Subsistence in many places (I bless the Lord I am not under any temptation therein, being liberally, and abundantly well provided for by the good people I live among; and therefore I may speak the more freely and boldly for others) I fear there is too sad neglect in divers Towns. It was a sign <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was away, when the Levites were fain to <HI>go into the fields,</HI> Nehem. 13.6, 10, 11. when they are forced to turn to the Meadow, to the Cart, and to the Plow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or else they cannot live, at least not live out of torment∣ing Debt. Is this the fruit of Gods being no Wilderness to us? <HI>O generation, see the word of the Lord.</HI> Minde the Example of good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 31.4. he encouraged such; (O take heed that there be not on the other side found among us <HI>a discouraged Ministry,</HI> respecting such (I mean) as are able, and faithful Ministers of the New Testament, who <HI>would gladly spend, and be spent</HI> for their

people:) <HI>He commanded the people</HI> (it is there said) and it was not therefore left as an arbitrary thing, or as an Alms: and minde the fruit of it, <HI>i. e.</HI> ver. 10. <HI>Since the people began to bring the offerings in∣to the house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat; for the Lord hath blessed his people, and that which is left is this great store.</HI> If particular <HI>Churches</HI> or <HI>Towns</HI> are really not able to supply the necessity of him that <HI>labours in the Word</HI> among them, should not such a poor people be relieved? might it not do well if some additional Provision were made out of some <HI>Publick Bank</HI> or <HI>Stock</HI> for an honourable relief of such? and that thereby we help to <HI>bear one anothers burthens?</HI> and <HI>be we not deceived, God is not mocked</HI> in this very matter, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6, 7. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.14. <HI>Ezra</HI> 7.24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Must they be Rated <HI>Will and Doom?</HI> Ah, when mens hearts die to the Word, no wonder if they soon die to the Dispensers of it: and then, <HI>What means this waste?</HI> and proud, covetous, disingenuous, unwise, captious, carping, bold, selfish spirits &amp; principles will be stirring; &amp;, <HI>Let us take turns to preach</HI> (and to govern the Church also as <HI>Moderators</HI> in it) <HI>rather then have this costly Service?</HI> and, <HI>What a weariness is it? &amp;c.</HI> If it must be so, should we won∣der if the Lord take them away that are such a Charge, and ease people of such a burden? Oh, <HI>muzzle not the mouth of</HI> that <HI>Ox that treadeth out the</HI> Spiritual <HI>Corn.</HI> And though Antichristian <HI>Begging Friars</HI> live by Alms, yet let it not be said of a Protestant people, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Churches, that they are so sordid in their spirits as to truckle under a <HI>Mendicant Ministry</HI>; and that will be a flatter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and an unfaithful Ministry at length, that is made to bow under the Temptations of <HI>Needing the Alms of the people:</HI> and remember, that a person or people may become guilty of <HI>Sacriledge</HI> by withholding what is due this way, as well as by robbing or taking away that which is already dedicated or given in to God, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.8. and that with∣holding, is there called <HI>Robbery</HI>; though I am far from pleading here for the <HI>quota pars</HI> there spoken of in particular, but onely as to the sin in general, the Apostle ranks it with, yea aggravates that sin of <HI>Sacriledge</HI> above <HI>Idolatry</HI> in the New Testament, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.22.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let the Magistracy also be Encouraged:</HI> this is part also of the <HI>Light of Israel,</HI> 2 Sam. 21.17. whereby under God we are instru∣mentally preserved from being <HI>a Wilderness, and a land of darkness:</HI> and a despised Government is a fore-runner of <HI>Anarchy</HI> and <HI>Confu∣sion</HI>; and such Rulers will be now oppressed with the Burthen of that


<PB N="48" REF="000182_0052_0FA3159878DFFB78"/>
Government, when <HI>Revilings</HI> and <HI>Knocks</HI> are their Reward; and their hearts will come at length to be alienated from such a people, each one saying, <HI>This Ruine shall not be under my hand,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.5, 6, 7. and <HI>Anarchy</HI> or <HI>Confusion</HI> in a State, exposeth them either to ruine one another by <HI>Divisions,</HI> or to be ruined by a <HI>Foreign Power,</HI> that will make a prey of them. Let <HI>All Encouragement</HI> therefore be afforded to this Magistracy: There is <HI>the bread of the Governour,</HI> Neh. 5.18. <HI>i. e.</HI> which is due to him from the people justly; with <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.21. <HI>&amp; Rom.</HI> 13.6, 7. and there are to be those <HI>Vestments</HI> of State (as Reverend Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> speaks) to distinguish them from, and dignifie them above other men, which there is need of, and therefore that they be enabled unto. <HI>Not my Lord Major, but his</HI> Horse <HI>rules the City,</HI> said a wise man once. People are awed and swayed much with outward Ensigns, or Marks and Characters of Dignity. <HI>Hence</HI> Ne∣hemiah (as Judicious and Reverend Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> on <HI>Neh.</HI> 6.11. in his Sermon, <HI>pag.</HI> 17, 18. well observes) <HI>even in a time of outward straits, keeps up his Table so as might suit with the State of the Governour, though he had not the bread of the Governour,</HI> Neh. 5.14, 18. <HI>He might at such a time have laid down his Table, having such an excuse, but</HI> Nehemiah <HI>knew such Entertainments kept up the Dignity and Honour of Government; and that these vulgar Encouragements do much sweeten the Severities of Magistracy, and will therefore rather continue them at his own Charge, then be without them: And their Attendants, and En∣tertainments, and other Pageantries, are not Ensigns of Vain-glory, but the necessary Vtensils by which the worth and excellency of Magistracy is notified to the common people, it being a Language best understood by the generality.</HI> As for that Self-denial there hath been by this Magistracy, (even as <HI>Neh.</HI> 5.19. so I pray) <HI>The Lord think upon them for good, according to all that they have done,</HI> and ventured, and suffered <HI>for this people.</HI> But as God blesseth the Country, so I hope the good people of this Land will be enlarged unto a more honourable, and propor∣tionable Allowance unto them, according as the Work, and Dignity of their Place calls for the same.</P>
<P><HI>O Generation</HI> (therefore) <HI>see the Word of the Lord</HI>▪ and know, that here is encouragement for Gods people in the worst times, for the Lord being our God, he will not be a Wilderness or land of darkness to us if we sincerely relye upon him: Can there be a <HI>Wilderness</HI> where the Glory of the God of Heaven dwells? Can there be <HI>Darkness</HI> where


<PB N="49" REF="000182_0053_0FA31598C6974950"/>
there is the Sun? There are Influences of light, and life, and refresh∣ing, and fruitfulness, and blessedness from this <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> to them that fear his Name. Christ hath imbarqu'd himself in this our State; and therefore as <HI>Caesar</HI> encouraged the Boat-man in time of danger by a dark Tempest, <HI>i. e. Confide nauta Caesarem vehis</HI>; so here, your Betrustment who are <HI>Israel</HI>'s Rulers here, is no less then the Son of God himself with so many of the sons and daughters of God in his arms; and <HI>if we forsake not him, he will not forsake us,</HI> as <HI>Asa</HI> encouraged those in his time, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.2. and as <HI>Deut.</HI> 2.7. so, for a longer time now then that, hath the Lord known and blest his people in this great Wilderness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and O let him <HI>never leave us, nor forsake us, but be with us as he was with our fathers,</HI> 1 Kin. 8 57. and that the shining brightness of the favour of the glorious God of <HI>Israel,</HI> signified by that Representation as of the Body of Heaven in its clearness, <HI>Exod.</HI> 24.10. may be still the Vision of the God of <HI>New England</HI>; not dark and cloudy, but light and glorious. And as I have said, <HI>See the word of the Lord</HI> to us, so I might say also, O ge∣neration, see the Way of <HI>Israel</HI> unto God, and our own wayes in spe∣cial: Have there been no beginnings of Revolt from under the Lord∣ship of our God? May not the Lord expostulate with us, as with those at <HI>Bochim, Judg</HI> 2.1—4. and say, I have removed your shoul∣der from the burden, and your hands from the pots, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.6. I have taken off the yoke from thy neck, and the Almighty hath cau∣sed light as by Snow in <HI>Salmon,</HI> I have given you Manna to the full, the Rock hath followed you, and you have had the Pillar of guidance and protection in all your Journeyings; but have you followed me fully with the Spirit of <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshua?</HI> Yea thou hast <HI>called upon me in trouble</HI> (in the time of Drought, a year never to be forgotten by us, and our Children after us, <HI>Anno</HI> 1662. and at other times) <HI>and I delivered thee, and answered thee,</HI> as <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I bid you make no league with <HI>Canaanites,</HI> &amp;c. (in respect of corrupt mixtures, and base compliances in matters of Religion) but (as <HI>Judg.</HI> 2.2.) <HI>why have you not obeyed my voice?</HI> why have you not come up fully to the practice of my Will held forth to you by my Servants? Why are there these and those <HI>Images of Jealousie</HI> among you? What is this noise that I hear in so many Churches? the noise of the Axes and Hammers of those that would cut and beat down the carved work? Why is there such neglect of your Church-work of the house


<PB N="42" REF="000182_0054_0FA3159984CDCC20" MS="y"/>
of God? and (as <HI>Ezra</HI> 7.23.) hath that been diligently done, which is commanded by the God of Heaven? for why should there be wrath against the Colony of the <HI>Massachusets?</HI> and see <HI>Hag.</HI> 1. <HI>beg.</HI> And why is Family-duties in many houses laid aside? that in multi∣tudes of Families there is (it may be) no Prayer from the one end of the week to the other? no Family-catechising, no Repetition of the Word preached, nor calling Children and Servants to an account of what they do or should hear? no reading of the Scripture? may be no Bible, or onely a torn Bible to be found? I mean, but a part of the Bible to be found, so that the whole Scripture is never read throughout in some Families? I wish this be not the condition of many Families, that either there is no Bible, or but a piece of a Bible, and that they can content themselves therewith. O that as to these, and such like things, we might be this day before the Lord as those at <HI>Bochim,</HI> weeping for the same before the Lord! And O what un∣thankfulness is it, that after the Lord hath done so much for us, in being to us <HI>not a wilderness nor a land of darkness,</HI> we should now say, <HI>We are lords, and will come no more at him:</HI> But let us testifie our reall thankfulness to God, by cleaving to the Lord in that good old way, wherein he hath been leading his people hitherunto. <HI>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be</HI> we <HI>not entangled with any yoke of bondage,</HI> of one kinde or other. Stand (I say) for your Liberties; not liberty to sin, but to be holy; liberty to <HI>run the wayes of Gods Commandments.</HI> Change not away your glory for that which will not profit: <HI>My son, fear thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change:</HI> (Prov. 24.21, 22.) <HI>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</HI> Gods people came hither for Liberty; <HI>i. e.</HI> Liberty in the way of Holiness: and our Holiness lyes in

<ITEM><HI>Separation,</HI> from Sin and Profaneness, not from the Churches and Saints of Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dedication,</HI> viz. of our Selves, our Children, and our All to God for God's ends.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Hence the Leaders of this people have, from the first, born express witness against Rigid Separation, Carnal Ceremonies, Profane unholy persons in Doctrine and Life: Search the printed Records of these things in the Works of our <HI>New-England</HI> Divines, and it will be found so. Therefore stand for your Liberties (Honoured, and Be∣loved

in the Lord) and let us not be guiled, befooled, deluded, baffled, or beaten out of them. I would hope that the Fundamental Interest of the Liberties and Priviledges of the Churches of Christ here, and of the Civil State, will never be transformed, alienated, and reduced to such an Interest which no sober, godly, wise-hearted Christians will judge worthy their contending for, or worth their standing up in the defence of, or hazarding their Estates and Lives for in the day of triall.</P>
<P>To conclude: The Lord help our Leaders in the Commonwealth, and in the Churches also, not to faint or be discouraged though they meet with opposition, difficulties, and ill requitals from some: <HI>Benè facere, &amp; male audire regium est,</HI> said <HI>Seneca.</HI> And a good speech was it of a person famous in his generation, <HI>i. e. A man in Publick Place needs two Handkerchiefs about him,</HI> viz. <HI>the one for his Sweat, the other for the Dirt.</HI> They must be laborious, &amp; prepare themselves to pass through evil report, as well as good. And though there be the murmuring and strife of the Congregation in some times of temptation, yet <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> must remember he is a Nursing-father, <HI>Numb.</HI> 11.12. and <HI>Paul</HI> as a Nurse must be gentle, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: respecting sweetness of wisdome, and love, both as to speech and silence] 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.7. and the Childe must not be thrown away because it is unquiet. Though there be a Storm, yet betray not the Ship; <HI>In naufragio</HI> (saith <HI>Seneca) Rector laudandus quem obruit mare clavum tenentem</HI> (cited by <HI>Reynolds</HI> of <HI>Passions,</HI> p. 232.) <HI>i. e.</HI> That Steersman or Master of the Vessel is in∣deed to be commended, that will not shrink from duty through fear or Self-interest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though he be wash'd, and raked over and over with the Sea, or whatever the event be. I beseech our Honoured Leaders and Steersmen not to desert us, or the Cause of God im∣barqued in the Vessel of this Commonwealth, and of these Chur∣ches. You are as <HI>David</HI> to serve [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] as <HI>Rowers</HI> under Christ, your <HI>own generation by the will of God,</HI> Acts 13.36. Let it never be said of you, That you did let go your hold by being false to your Precious Betrustments this way. Yea, should a Wrack come, (which the Lord in mercy prevent) yet also may you so manage your selves, as to be seen to the last <HI>Clavum tenentes</HI>; serving Jesus Christ faithfully here, according to that Command <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.11. to all the Rulers of the World, and that without being byassed with a Spirit of Men-pleasing, Temporizing, Humourizing, Faction, Popula∣rity,

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is by Christ that you Rule, and as you are by him▪ so you are to be for him: and if we All cleave to the Lord, we need not then fear but God will be with us, so that we shall be able with <HI>Luther</HI> in greatest shakings to sing the Forty sixth Psalm: and though all the Earth should be gathered against this <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> yet the Lord our God can make it <HI>a burdensome stone, and a Cup of trembling,</HI> Zech. 12.2, 3. So that when these and those of the Nations shall enquire about the state of such a people, <HI>What shall one then answer the Mes∣sengers of the Nations?</HI> Truly as <HI>Isai.</HI> 14.32. <HI>i. e.
