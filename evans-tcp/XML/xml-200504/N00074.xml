<P>AS the reviving of this Root of Bitterness in the Quaker, after its being dead above an hundred years, caused the Translation and first Impression of this small Book under another Title; so the sprouting forth of its fruits of gall and wormwood, and the issuings from this corrupt fountain of those streams which make sad the City of God, have occasioned its second Im∣pression, under the Name and Title put upon it by its Author <HI>Guy de Brez:</HI> whose <HI>praise in the Churches</HI> by his labo∣rious planting, and faithful watering of them by his blood, is largely set forth in the famous Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> the third <HI>Volume,</HI> in <HI>the Continuation of the History by Dr.</HI> Ed∣ward Bulkly, <HI>pag. 37, 38, 41, 42, 43.</HI> where he is described to be not onely an eminent Witness of Christs Truth unto the death, but his Labours, Prayers and Sufferings are there re∣corded to posterity; his rejoycing in God, when hands and feet were so laden with Iron Chains, as they eat through his Flesh to the very bones; his glorying in their ratling, more then if they had been Chains of Gold; his fulness of God, when shut up in the Dungeon, which for its darkness was called <HI>Brunain,</HI> where he had no more air but at one little hole, where drunkards vented their urine; even then his heart leaped for joy, provoking his wife to comfort, in that God had not onely given her a Husband who was a Minister of Christs Gospel, but to be honoured with Martyrdome; <HI>A Dignity</HI> (said he) <HI>which the Angels of Heaven are not

<P>This <HI>Translation</HI> is a small part of the Book; the rest is Doctrinal, and a solid Conviction of their Tenents: which whosoever shall intelligently reade, and compare his Rea∣sons with those of our Worthies in these our dayes, he will finde that as <HI>Satan is the old Serpent,</HI> so <HI>Christ Jesus is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</HI> A three∣fold Character he giveth of them in his Epistle to his Book: <HI>1.</HI> That they multiplied quotations of Scripture against their true sense and meaning, to gain applause of the weak and unstable. <HI>2.</HI> That they gloried in their specious Holiness of Conversation. <HI>3.</HI> That they professed their readiness to suffer unto death.

<HEAD>The Rise, Spring and Foundation OF THE ANABAPTISTS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1521 and the year insuing, there arose a certain number of mutinous and seditious persons, who secretly made Factions: they chiefly dwelt in the quarters of <HI>Saxony,</HI> which bordered upon the River <HI>Salah</HI>; among whom their chief was <HI>Nicholas Stork.</HI> They dreamed dreams, and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicholas Stork, <HI>and his accomplices, they preached dreams,</HI></NOTE> That they spake familiarly with God by Visions, they preached their dreams for truths and Divine Oracles; and because that there should come a <HI>new world, wherein should dwell righteousness:</HI> Therefore they ought to exterminate all the wicked, with all the Princes and unbe∣lieving Magistrates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>oppose Magi∣strat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI></NOTE> from off the earth (they called all those <HI>unbelievers</HI> which were not of their Sect and Faction.) From out of this School came <HI>Thomas Muntzer,</HI> Dr. <HI>Balthazar Hub∣more, Melchior Rink, John Hutt, John Deuter, Lodovike Het∣zer,</HI> &amp;c. All these boasted that they familiarly conferred with the Lord. In their teachings, they with heat of affection did de∣fame and detract from the Ministers of the Gospel:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Ministers.</HI></NOTE> afterward with the like violence fell upon the Magistrate, thinking that if they could make void these two Orders unto the Church, the wolves might safely fall upon and dismember the Flock; where∣fore these wolves, (i. e.) these false Teachers, have alwayes principally set themselves against the Ministers of the Church, and the Magistrates, to see if they could drive them out from

the Flock, or at least disgust some of the sheep against their Pastors; that so estranging them from them, they might undo them.</P>
<P>Their Doctrine suddenly spread throughout all the Country, and in a little space they gathered much people after them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Doctrine spreads, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baptize thousands.</HI></NOTE> and Rebaptized many thousands; insomuch as many simple people were led by a zeal without knowledge, being by their fair ap∣pearance insnared. They tyed themselves unto the only simple and naked Letter of the Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish over th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir soul intentions with fair pretences.</HI></NOTE> without regard to the sence thereof; they carried it very fairly before all men: for they had alwayes in their mouths, the <HI>love, faith,</HI> and the <HI>fear</HI> of God, the <HI>mortification</HI> of the flesh, and the <HI>cross</HI>; which were the garnish wherewith (that they might be of value to the simple) they painted and adorned themselves: but inasmuch as such colours were false, they lasted not long, but they soon began to fade, and without fraud to appear what they were.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Muntzer</HI> (of whom we formerly spake) said, <HI>That whosoever would be saved must firstly flye all manifest vices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muntzers <HI>Do∣ctrine.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mur∣ders, Blasphemies against the Name of God: that he must chastise and macerate his body by fastings and mean apparel; that he must hold forth an austere visage, speak little,</HI> &amp;c. he called these things the <HI>Cross</HI>▪ the <HI>Mortification of the Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Discipline</HI>: after that he had so fashioned his people, he said, That <HI>they must withdraw from the multitude, and conversation of men; and often to think upon God, who he is, and whether he hath care of us; whe∣ther Christ suffered death for us, and whether our Religion were to be preferred before that of the Turks:</HI> moreover, <HI>that we ought to ask a sign from God, to be assured whether he hath care of us, and whether we owned the true Religion: if instantly he gave not a sign, that we ought to persist and pursue in prayers, yea, lively to complain of him, as of one that doth us wrong; for seeing the Scri∣pture promises that God will grant what he is asked for, he doth not well in not giving a sign to the man who desireth his knowledge.</HI> He said, That <HI>this anger and reproach was very pleasing unto God, because that he thereby saw the inclination and heart of our spirit,


<PB N="3" REF="000119_0006_0FA02A3D6B28EB70"/>
and that without doubt being thus urged, he would declare himself by some evident sign, quenching the thirst of the spirit, and doing unto us as formerly unto the Fathers.</HI> He said moreover, That <HI>Gods will was declared by dreams, and there laid the foundations of his doctrine; insomuch that if the dream of any might be interpreted, he praised him greatly in his Sermons.</HI></P>
<P>After that by this means he had by little and little gained some, he discovered what he had long before plotted in the City of <HI>Alsted,</HI> which is in the Marches of <HI>Turing:</HI> He began to enroll the names of those that were entred into league with him, and by solemn Oath they promised assistance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Enrolled the names of his disciples, and swears them to assist him, to cut off the unbelie∣ving Magistrates</HI></NOTE> to dispatch the wicked Princes and Magistrates (for they generally account∣ed all Superiours wicked) and to substitute new ones: he said, That it was given him in charge from God so to do: so did he speak of his dreams and such like things.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick</HI> Prince of <HI>Saxony</HI> did at first bear with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther <HI>inter∣cedes for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, with the Ele∣ctor of</HI> Saxony.</NOTE> and that at the request of <HI>Luther.</HI> But in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>23. he set him∣self seditiously to preach, and publickly to fasten not only upon Ministers of the Word, but also upon the Magistrates; and fu∣riously declared that their Liberty was violated,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>But publickly opposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Mini∣sters and Ma∣gistrates is dri∣ven out of</HI> Al∣sted.</P>

<P>Having then changed the Magistrates of <HI>Mulhuze,</HI> and ha∣ving put in Anabaptists, there arose many troubles as we have formerly declared;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Taught commu∣nity▪ equality of dignity.</HI></NOTE> for he taught the <HI>Community of goods,</HI> and <HI>that the equality of dignity did very well resent humanity</HI>; and <HI>that all the world should abide in the liberty wherein it was first created</HI>; and <HI>that there should be an indifferent usage of goods</HI>: he said, <HI>That this was divinely revealed unto him</HI>; and <HI>that Princes and great ones must be rejected</HI>; and <HI>that the sword of</HI> Gideon <HI>was given unto him, against all Tyrants, to restore the liberty, and new Reign of Christ upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th.</HI> All these pretences made the people de∣sist from their ordinary labour;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By this, people desist from their labour.</HI></NOTE> and when they had need of any thing, they took it from those that had, whether they would or not.</P>
<P>Divers moneths he thus led on the train, so as in the year 1525. the Husbandmen and Labourers took up Arms in <HI>Swabe</HI> and <HI>Francony,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They take up Arms,</HI></NOTE> to the number of fourty thousand, who slew the greatest part of the Nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kill the Nobi∣lity.</HI></NOTE> sackt and burnt their Castles and Fortresses; he went on to prosecute his Game, thinking the time now to be come, to bring into action what he had for∣merly deliberated: he after caused them to found some Artil∣lery in the Cordiliers Church; he called much people from the fields out of hopes of pillage, and to make themselves rich.</P>
<P>He in all his affairs consulted with a bold foolish fellow called <HI>Phifer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phifers <HI>dream.</HI></NOTE> who had dreams and visions in high esteem; and a∣mong other discourse he said,
<Q>That in a dream he had seen multitudes of Mice in a Stable, which he had made to fly: which he interpreted so as he had command from God to take up Arms, to set himself in array to discomfit the Nobility.</Q></P>

<PB REF="000119_0008_0FA02A3EE3FF31D8"/><HI>Muntzer</HI> was somewhat more cool; though he preached with great violence, yet he would not run any hazard untill that the Neighbourhood had taken up Arms: and the more easily to bring about his enterprize, he wrote unto the Labourers in the Mynes of the Territories of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> admonishing them to fall upon the Princes without any respect or consideration; for these that were ready in <HI>Francony</HI> drew near unto <HI>Turing.</HI> Thereupon <HI>Phifer,</HI> who could not forbear, took the field with his, and sack'd the Country about <HI>Isfield,</HI> pillaged the Fortres∣ses and Temples (or Churches) and slew divers Gentlemen, taking others Prisoners: which having done, he returned laden with plunder; and having so well sped, the popularity were encouraged: in the mean time they skirmished and ra∣vined in the Country of <HI>Mansfield</HI>; wherefore <HI>Muntzer</HI> thinking that there was a revolt in all parts, came forth from <HI>Mulhuze</HI> with 300 seditious men. Upon these stirs <HI>Albert</HI> Count of <HI>Mansfield</HI> at an instant assembled some Troops▪ of Horse, and fought <HI>Muntzer,</HI> so as 200 were left dead upon the place; the rest being astonished, withdrew, and fled toward <HI>Francuse,</HI> and sojourning there, waited for the recruit of their Army; which was the cause of retarding their stirs.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Princes gathered together, to the num∣ber of 1500 Horse, with some Foot: the Peasants being en∣camped in a Mount near <HI>Francuse,</HI> they could not easily be as∣sailed, by reason of the Carts they had furnished themselves withall. The poor people being unprovided either of Arms or Artillery, and for the most part not acquainted with Souldiery; the Princes being moved with compassion, admonished them by messages, that they would deliver up the Authors of this Sedition; and that laying down their arms, every one might with assurance, and without fear of punishment return unto their houses. <HI>Muntzer</HI> then fearing his skin, advanced into the midst of the Troops, and with a stern countenance made his Oration.</P>

<P>This Oration being finished, they came to close; and no sooner were the Artillery and small shot discharged, but these poor people, as men amazed, and deprived of understanding, neither defend themselves, nor set themselves to flight for safety, but sang their vulgar song, to invoke the aid of the holy Ghost: some trusting in the promises of <HI>Muntzer,</HI> waited for succour from Heaven. The Harquebusses being discharged, they began to re-inforce the battel, and to slay them right down; then they betook themselves to flight all in a rout toward <HI>Fran∣cuse:</HI> some of them drew off to the other part of the Moun∣tain, and some the while bare the brunt of the battel in the Val∣ley against the Horse; of whom there fell one or two: but so hotly were they pursued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5000 <HI>Slain.</HI></NOTE> that there were 5000 left in the place: soon after this slaughter the City of <HI>Francuse</HI> was taken, and near 300 prisoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 <HI>Prisoners.</HI></NOTE> which were beheaded. <HI>Muntzer</HI> having gained the City by flight, hid himself in an house near unto the Gate; whither by accident there came a Gentleman, whose Waiting-man going up to see the rooms, he found a man laid upon the bed, who asked him who he was, and whether he was not fled from the Battel, and whether he was not one of the se∣ditious? By accident there lay a Purse near unto the bed; the other taketh up the booty, and having opened it, he found therein Letters, whereby <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Mansfield</HI> did admonish <HI>Muntzer</HI> to desist from his enterprize, and not to cause the poor people to mutiny: these Letters when he had read, he asked him, <HI>if the Letters were not directed to him?</HI> which he denied very stifly, untill being sharply threatned, craving pardon, he con∣fessed

The <HI>Lantgrave</HI> puzled him, proving by Testimony of Scripture, that the Magistrates ought to be had in reverence; and that all seditions were forbidden by God; and that it was not lawful for a Christian to avenge his private quarrel: where∣unto <HI>Muntzer</HI> had not to answer.

<P>For in the year 1533: there came to <HI>Munster</HI> an Hollander named <HI>John Becold</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By</HI> John Be∣cold <HI>a Taylor of</HI> Leyden, <HI>who</HI></NOTE> by Trade a Taylor or Sewer of Garments; but rather a Raveller or tearer in pieces: he was a witty fellow, eloquent, cautelous, and very audacious, having a little read the Scripture, he could fully dissemble matters: in sum, he was a true and perfect Anabaptist; in the beginning of which familiarity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>insinua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es him∣self into the company of the Ministers.</HI></NOTE> he insinuated himself into the company of the Ministers of the Gospel, and asked them whether they thought it was well done to baptize little children? they answered, Yes; and then he began to deride and jeer with disdain: he thus car∣ried matters near nine moneths; often disputing against, and debating with the Ministers concerning Baptism; notwithstand∣ing in the mean while, wheresoever he could, he secretly sowed the Doctrine of the Anabaptists. Then <HI>Bernard Rotman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rotman <HI>oppo∣ses them,</HI></NOTE> of whom w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spake before, seeing the drift of the Anabaptists, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sermon exhorted the people to pray unto God for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they might keep his Doctrine pure; and to preserve it from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he corruptions of enraged men, especially from the Anabaptists, who secretly crept in among them, and slid into their companies: for if their opinion prevailed, the state of the Commonwealth and Religion would be poor and miserable.

This troubled the Senate, and they were somewhat astonished at it. Wherefore to prevent further trou∣ble, it was commanded, That both Anabaptists and Preachers of the Gospel, should repair to the Town-house with the learned men.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Disputation, wherei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Rot∣man <HI>declares himself:</HI> Her∣man Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>futes him.</HI></NOTE> In this Disputation <HI>Rotman,</HI> who had for some time co∣vered matters, openly declared himself an Anabaptist, and con∣demned Childrens Baptism, as wicked and detestable: but <HI>Her∣man Busch</HI> so contradicted him, as by the Word of God he con∣futed him; which may yet be proved, by the Acts drawn up by the Publick Notary.

<P>The principal Anabaptists then were <HI>Rotman, John Becold</HI> of <HI>Leyden, Bernard Knipperdoling, Gerard Cipperbrok, Bernard Crechting.</HI></P>

The Citizens and more wealthy among them, seeing the City to swarm with strangers, withdrew as fairly as they could, abandoning their place unto the Anabaptists: this was about <HI>Lent,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>February</HI> 1534. By this means the Anabaptists became Masters, and chose a new Senate of their own party, with Consuls; among whom were <HI>Knip∣perdoling</HI> and <HI>Cipperbrok:</HI> soon after they fell upon the Temple

These being driven out, they fall upon pillaging their Estates: by this every one may know by what spirit these Anabaptistical Hypocrites were led: there is no act so fello∣nious, horrible, cruel and wicked, that ever was done, which they did not commit. In the beginning they talked of nothing but the Spirit and Holiness; they said, it was not lawful for a Christian to be a Magistrate, and that it was not lawful to bear Arms; but after they had brought all under their paw, and in their power, then it was lawful to take the Publick Arms, with the Town-house, and to chuse a Magistrate to their minde, yea, with rejection of him that was ordained of God; and thrust themselves into his place, and to make themselves Consuls and Senators as they have done: there is not need of much speak∣ing, for the world knoweth it. Where now are the fair spee∣ches of those Anabaptists? <HI>Do not resist evil: He that will take away thy coat, give him thy cloak also.</HI> These have not only pillaged and stript honest men of their clothes, but of all that they had, and have driven them miserable out of their houses, with their wives and little ones, and have exposed them to death by the Besiegers of the City.</P>
<P>At that time there arose in the City of <HI>Munster</HI> a great number of Prophets (for they usurped that name) the prin∣cipal of whom were <HI>John Matthews</HI> of <HI>Harling,</HI> and one <HI>Pistor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Prophet</HI> Joh.

By Pro∣phetical Authority, this holy Prophet commanded all the City to bring in all their Gold, Silver, and other moveable goods


<PB N="15" REF="000119_0018_0FA02A4D16E23338"/>
to be common, and that none upon pain of death, should re∣serve any thing for his own private use: and to this end, there was a Publick house appointed. The people were very much astonished at the rigour of this Edict, yet notwithstanding o∣beyed it: it was not possible to retain or conceal any portion; for there were two Maides Divineresses, who did reveal it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divineresses re∣veal such as re∣tained the goods and all books besides the Bible to be burnt.</HI></NOTE> if there were any that did retain any thing. Afterwards these Prophets commanded that none should keep any books except the Holy Bible; and that all others should publickly be brought forth and abolished: he said, that he received this Command from God; wherefore great numbers of books were brought together and consumed by fire.</P>
<P>It came to pass that an Artificer named <HI>Hubert Trutelin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubert Trute∣lin <HI>calls them Prophets of a</HI> T—<HI>and slai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> who being displeased with the acting of these Prophets reproached them, calling them Prophets <HI>de Merde</HI>: he was accused, and all the people were caused to come together in their Arms: they sentenced the poor man to death; whereat the people were marvellously frighted. <HI>John Matthews</HI> the chief Prophet laid hands upon the poor man, and when as he was thrown down, gave him a stab with a Pike, without wounding him mortally, whatsoever his endeavours were; then he commanded him to be taken from thence, and that he should be carried to another place; and taking the Musket of another young man that was neer him, he shot him through with a bullet: when he was fal∣ling to the ground, the Prophet said, That it was revealed unto him from heaven, that the time of his death was not yet come; and that God had accepted him to favour, though he died a few dayes after; whereof when the Prophet had notice, he took a long Pike, and violently ran through the City, crying out, <HI>that God the Father had given him in command to repulse the Enemie from the City.</HI> As he drew neer unto the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Matthew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>slain.</HI></NOTE> a Souldier called <HI>Mesnicus</HI> faced him, and shot him quite through the belly: This was the woful end of this mad Prophet: and although the fraud of these Prophets was well known, yet the people were so bewitched by them, and so deprived of their reason, that they much bewailed this their goodly Prophet, saying, That

<P><HI>John Becold</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> commanded the second Prophet after him, to be of a good courage; because that of a long time be∣fore, it had been revealed unto him, that he should come to such an end, and that he should marry his widow.

His waiting-Gentlemen were twenty eight, clad like Courtiers, with garments of mixed colour of green and blew, to signifie his Heavenly and Earthly Power. Upon the Kings Girdle was written, <HI>The power of God is my strength:</HI> thus was the Name of God prophaned and blasphemed, to cloak this Villains stinking infamy. Furthermore, his Title was, <HI>The King of the New Jerusalem, King of Righteousness, through∣out all the World.</HI> The pomp of his chief Wife (for he had many together) was equal to his own: his Servants were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in green, and bordered with a brown colour; and upon their sleeve there was a World with a little Cross about it, and two Swords thwarted a-cross. He had his Throne set up aloft, whereunto he ascended by three steps▪ and all was beset with Gold and Jewels. The Law-suits which ordinarily came before him, were for the most part about Women and Divorces, inso∣much as some who had lived almost all their life long together, now separated one from another. It came to pass one day, that when the people were in the Market-place, close crouding, and in a throng to hear, that <HI>Knipperdoling</HI> leaped on their heads, and scrambling with his hands and feet being now above them, he breathed upon the men one after another into their mouthes, saying, <HI>The Father hath sanctified thee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Knipperdo∣lings <HI>blasphemy</HI></NOTE> <HI>receive the Holy Ghost.</HI> One day he fell a dancing before the King, say∣ing, <HI>Thus I am wont to do with my Whore, but now the Father hath commanded me to do it before the King:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Confesses him∣self an whore∣master.</HI></NOTE> but because he did it too long, and would not make an end, the King was angry, and went his way.

but the King surprizing him, threw him down, and three dayes kept him in Prison.</P>
<P>Is there not here to be seen a wonderfull rage and mad∣ness? Who could have believed that any bearing humane shape, should have been left to commit things so foolish, absurd, vil∣lanous and execrable? but it cannot be otherwise with such as violate, trample upon, and reject the Word of God; they are by Divine judgement smitten, so as to be an example to the Elect. But let us behold their goodly glorious King, now mounted with more then Royal Pomp: where is the spirit of these Anabaptists, who were so ready to reprove and reject others? At first they cried out against all; if they saw any Matron wear silk, or any man of fashion to wear a gold Ring, they cried down all▪ but now their glorious King Taylor omit∣teth nothing, that may set forth his Pomp and State. In the beginning they would not bear to hear, that any honest man should be a Bailiff, or Governour of a Village; but soon the wind is changed, and now by command from the Father, their King is not King of a Village, but of the whole World; for so he caused himself to be styled. During this Siege, the Pro∣phets of <HI>Munster</HI> published a Book, which they intituled, <HI>The Ristitution</HI>; wherein they maintained <HI>Muntzers</HI> damnable Do∣ctrine, and an infinite of Errours.</P>
<P>Afterwards in the Moneth of <HI>August,</HI> on the day which is called S. <HI>Bartholomews,</HI> the new Prophet called <HI>John Twiscoscar</HI> sounded the Trumpet through the streets, and cried out, that <HI>All should meet in Arms about the way to the great Church; for they must give a repulse to the Enemies of the City:</HI> being thi∣ther come, they finde a Supper ready, which the King had pro∣vided; and by command the people did sit down, to the num∣ber of four thousand: the King, Queen, and Courtiers wait∣ed at the Table.

of Devils, then the Table of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now when the Supper was ended, the new Prophet gat him up into the Pulpit, and asked them whether they would obey the Word of God? they all said, Yes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twisc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar <HI>reveals that</HI> 28 <HI>Teachers must be sent forth.</HI></NOTE> he told them then that the com∣mand of the Father was, that they must send Twenty eight Teachers of the Word. Then he named them in order, de∣claring the place whither each should go: Six were sent to <HI>Osemberg,</HI> as many to <HI>Warrendort</HI>; eight to <HI>Susar,</HI> and as many to <HI>Corsfield.</HI></P>
<P>The King and the Queen with those that served at the Ta∣ble, supped afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King and Queen and the</HI> 28 <HI>Teachers sup together.</HI></NOTE> and those which were appointed to be sent forth. As they were at Supper, the King rose up, and said, <HI>That he had received a Commission from the Father:</HI> whereas upon an adventure there was a Souldier which had been taken, the King accused him that he was a Traitor as <HI>Judas,</HI> and with his own hands cut off his head. This being done, he returned to sit down at Table, and by way of merriment recited what he had done. After Supper within night, they caused the twenty eight above-mentioned, to depart out of the City; and over and above their expences, they gave to every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them certain pieces of Gold, to leave in such places where their Doctrine should not be received, in witness of their perdition, and eternal damnation, for their refusal of the peace and do∣ctrine of Salvation.</P>
<P>And when they were arrived at the places assigned unto them, they began to run through the City with horrible cries, crying, <HI>Repent, repent, otherwise ye will suddenly perish:</HI> then they cast their garments upon the ground, and threw their pieces of Gold which were given unto them upon their gar∣ments, assuring them that they were sent by the Father, to bring peace unto them if they would receive it: they com∣manded them to put all their goods in common; if they did refuse it, by this sign, and as by a mark, they did bear witness against their ingratitude, and evil deeds: for behold the time now is come, which was foretold by the Prophets, wherein the Lord God would, that Righteousness should reign through


<PB N="22" REF="000119_0025_0FA02A5DA1E769B0"/>
all the earth: and after that the King shall have discharged his trust, and shall have so done, that Righteousness shall reign every where; Then Christ shall deliver up the Kingdome to the Father.</P>
<P>Upon these words they were apprehended, and in the be∣ginning fairly demanded, then by the Rack examined of their faith, life, and Ammunition of the City. They answered, that they alone had the true Doctrine, which they would unto the death maintain: for since the Apostles time the Gospel was not truly preached, and that there was no righteousness; that there were four Prophets, two of which were true, namely, <HI>David George,</HI> and <HI>John Becold</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI>; two were false, namely, the Pope, and <HI>Luther</HI> worse then the Pope. Being asked why they drave the honest people out of the City, a∣gainst their faith and promise, and detained their Goods, Wives and Children; and by what Text of Scripture they could war∣rant that unrighteousness? They answered, That the time was now come, wherein the Word of Christ should be fulfilled, <HI>that the meek should possess the earth</HI>; and that God in this man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er gave the goods of the Egyptians unto the Israelites: Af∣ter, they declared their Ammunition and Victuals that was in the City, with their Garrison, some of whom had above five Wives. Moreover, that they looked for Souldiers from <HI>Frise∣land</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who being arrived, the King would take the Field with all his Army, to reduce the whole World under his power and subjection, after he had slain their Kings which did not righteousness. After they were questioned, and still per∣sisted in their opinions, they were all beheaded, except one who escaped.</P>
<P>At the same time there arose another Prophet, called <HI>Henry Hilvers,</HI> a wicked man, subtil and wary; he came to declare un∣to the King and the people, that the heavenly Father had re∣vealed unto him, that three rich Cities with all their goods should be given unto them by God, namely, <HI>Amsterdam, De∣venter,</HI> and <HI>Wesel.</HI> The King hearing this, set himself to con∣sult with his Council, by what means they might bring these


<PB N="23" REF="000119_0026_0FA02A5DB87F0728"/>
three Cities unto Anabaptism; and to this effect they sent cer∣tain men unto these places. In the first place he sent <HI>James Campen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and commanded him to be Prince in that City, and ordered him <HI>John Matthews</HI> of <HI>Middleburg</HI> to be his consort: they went into <HI>Holland,</HI> and hid themselves at a Sectaries house, and there with their mischievous doctrine they impoysoned many, re-baptized their disciples, and secretly by night held Conventicles and Meetings; yea, also they scat∣tered their poyson in the neighbouring Cities: for in the City of <HI>Leyden,</HI> in the moneth of <HI>January,</HI> in the year following, 1535, many were put to death for Anabaptism, and for their seditious counsels and enterprises. Moreover, in the end of the year 1534 the King sent into <HI>Friseland, John Gelen,</HI> a subtil man, and well vers'd in arms, he having formerly had charge in the Army; the King gave him good store of gold out of the spoil of the Churches, and gave him in charge to raise an Army in <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise</HI>; and acted so by certain men that assisted him, that on the 30 of <HI>March</HI> 1535, he mustered up and raised an Army, and took a Monastery, and drave out the Friers, and there quartered his Camp, until his Army should augment and be compleated. <HI>George Schenck</HI> who was then Governour of <HI>Frise,</HI> speedily assaulted them as seditious persons: they valliantly de∣fended themselves, but he gained the Victory and defeated them; but not without great loss: they were all cut off ex∣cept sixty, who were brought to <HI>Leanard,</HI> and after were pun∣ished according to their deserts. Their Captain <HI>John Gelen</HI> escaped and fled to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to be the author of some fur∣ther sedition; where he found many Anabaptists, whom <HI>James Campense</HI> had seduced; he promised them great matters, high∣ly exalting the glory and liberty at <HI>Munster,</HI> magnificently preaching the new raign of righteousness upon earth. For by this time the renown of <HI>Munster</HI> was spread, which anima∣ted the courage of many; seeing so great an Army had be∣sieged them, yea, and had stormed them often, with the loss of many; and that they saw the Anabaptists to persist in their purpose: many who were desirous to be freed from their debts,


<PB N="24" REF="000119_0027_0FA02A5E75564048"/>
and to triumph, did greatly desire to enjoy the liber∣ty of <HI>Munster. Henry Gesbell</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a stout man, and of renown for Souldiery, was gained by the A∣nabaptists, and was very familiar with <HI>John Gelen</HI>; who being drawn to their party by large promises, much was wrought by him: for in the conclusion 600 Anabaptists met together, with whom they intended and attempted to take <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to set up their new raign, as they had done at <HI>Munster</HI>: for upon the 10. of <HI>May,</HI> the first and the chiefest of them, assembled in the house of <HI>Peter Gale</HI>; where after consultation they came forth into the street; for that day the Citizens were merry, and had according to a custom among them been at a Game.</P>
<P>About 10 a clock, the Anabaptists ran together in the streets, about the Cross, which was a publick place, crying out, <HI>Amend your lives,</HI> &amp;c. whosoever will this night be rich and happy, let him march along with us: and as the number of their people encreased more and more, they slew part of them who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> charge of the watch, and the other part they took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Now the Citizens assembled themselves, and assaulted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ana∣baptists; but they carried the matter so ill, as that their Con∣sul was slain, and the rest put to flight; but then they reinfor∣ced their strength, and gave battel unto the Anabaptists, who were then defeated, though with much blood which then was shed; among whom <HI>John Gelen,</HI> and <HI>Henry Gesbel</HI> were slain.</P>
<P><HI>James Campense</HI> was taken, and executed by the hand of Justice. Afterwards in many parts of those places of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Anabaptists raised tumults and seditions; not without loss and great damage unto several honest people, for they could not keep themselves quiet: for when they were defeated in one part, they began in another; making in secret many disciples, who waited for the restoring of the Kingdom unto <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>There was a certain man in the Town of <HI>Leyden,</HI> who being forced unto it by torments, confessed that the King of the A∣nabaptists dwelt in <HI>Vtricht</HI>; but that he was not yet crowned, but only designed to be Prince in the Kingdom of Israel: this prisoner was not only found possessed of vessels of silver and


<PB N="25" REF="000119_0028_0FA02A608A979028"/>
gold, which by evil practise he had stoln; but also guilty of several crimes, for which he was executed: there is no doubt, but that by this King they did intend <HI>David George.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, although at <HI>Munster</HI> their King and Pro∣phets had made unto the poor people most great and magnifi∣cent promises; yet now every day they were oppressed with great necessity, and chiefly through Famine, insomuch as many were starved, and died for want of bread.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants secretly resolved to apprehend the King, and to deliver him up unto the Bishop, and by this means to pur∣chase their peace: the King making doubt hereof, and not trusting to himself; he chose twelve men, whom he judged would be most faithful unto him, and appointed them to be Captains of each Quarter of the City, that he might be in the better rest and assurance; afterwards he promised the people, that by <HI>Easter</HI> they should be freed and delivered from this siege, and all their poverty: for he hoped that the Legates which he had sent into <HI>Frise</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and other Regions, having raised Souldiers, would make some stirs; and that by this means the siege would be raised before <HI>Munster</HI>: but he was deceived by his vain hopes, as we have heard (for there was a goodly dispatch of his Legates:) He promised great matters to the Captains which he had chosen; how when the Camp should be raised before the City, he would make them great Lords and Princes; and particularly he gave unto <HI>John Dents</HI> the Empire of <HI>Saxony</HI>: whereby appeared the bruitish∣ness and Diabolical rage of this pleasant and goodly King Tay∣lor, to promise to give that which was none of his own; and to take it away from him, to whom God had given it.</P>
<P>In the Moneth of <HI>February,</HI> the famine was so great, that many died through hunger and want. One of the Queens (for there were many) called <HI>Elisa,</HI> out of pity to the People, oc∣casionally said, That she did not believe that it was pleasing un∣to God, that the people should thus perish through famine: The King, who had store of good provision in his house, not only for necessity, but also to make good cheer; withal know∣ing


<PB N="26" REF="000119_0029_0FA02A630DF5C2D0"/>
this, brought her into the Market place with all the other Queens, and commanded them all to fall down upon their knees about her; and unsheathing his sword he struck off her head from off her shoulders: and not being contented herewith, he reproached her as a bawd: the other wives fell a singing after this goodly deed, <HI>Glory be unto God in the highest</HI>; and gave thanks unto the heavenly Father: and then they fell a dan∣cing; the King led the Gallia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and exhorted the poor people to leap, dance, and to rejoyce also, who had nought left but a little bread and salt.</P>
<P>When <HI>Easter</HI> was come, and that there appeared no sign of deliverance, the people were, and that not without cause, much grieved: The King who all along fed them with fair promises, fell sick, and continued so six dayes together, that he might cover himself with some excuse: after those six dayes, he came into the Market place, and there shewing himself, he told the people, that he had promised them deliverance: but it must spiritually be understood, and behold this was the deliverance; he said, That he had rode the blinde Ass, and that the Father had laid upon him the sins of the multitude; and that he had born them, and taken them away: and that now they were de∣livered from all their sins; which was the deliverance that he had promised unto them. Thus must the poor and miserable people content themselves, to hear this execrable blasphemy. The blind Ass of this Gallant, whereupon this devillish and desperate man rode, was the poor people, that endured and did bear the enormities of such a villain, whom they adored.</P>
<P>If we should reckon up the miseries, calamities, and other evils which those of the City endured, it were a miserable thing to hear: divers who would not bear the famine, fled to the ene∣my; not so much looking for mercy, as that their pain might be expired by death: many crawled upon their bellies in the streets, and others dyed in the wayes: it was an horrible thing to see many walking quite stripped of flesh, nothing left but skin upon the bones. Their ears, lips, cheeks, and noses were so shrunk up, as one might almost see day-light through them, as


<PB N="27" REF="000119_0030_0FA02A6365093F38"/>
through a piece of Paper. Through feebleness, they could not carry their bodies: some went to the enemy disarmed, trailing a staff in their hands: whiles provision lasted, none talked of going to the enemy, but now when this was spent, then began their desolation and discontent: yet they helpt themselves as long as they could▪ They sowed in the sides of the walls, and in all waste places, rapes, pease, and such seeds, and with this they made shift to pass the Sum∣mer: But when this crop was spent, then it was as Venison to them to feed on dogs, rats and mice; and when the City▪ was taken, there were but two horses left alive: many were so pres∣sed with hunger, as that they did eat the flesh of dead carcasses. Finally, they boiled shoes, old leather▪ and skins, and beat them together, and put them into a pot, and mingled all sorts of mat∣ter together, which they could finde: this was instead of bread; and yet this villain and wicked cheater deceived them, telling them, God tried them, to see whether they would be faithful and constant; and that certainly the Father would deliver them in a short time. Now they that would depart out of the City, to be delivered from these mischiefs, were to present themselves before the King: and there this Robber took from them all that they had; and when they were ransacked, he said, Now get you gone to the Hereticks.</P>
<P>The King had yet provision of Victuals in his Palace, for a∣bout two Moneths; but it was only for his Courtiers. They consulted how they might victual the City. Then there stood forth one named <HI>Hansken Vander Langke-strate,</HI> he was one of the Kings Secretaries, and one in whom he confided much: he undertook to re-victual the City, and to bring in three hundred Souldiers to their assistance, and all in fifteen dayes. He de∣parted out of the City, and under this pretence went unto the enemy; and for a certain sum of money sold the City unto the Bishop, offering to lose his life if he did not accomplish i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the time for this Plot to be put in execution, was the even of S. <HI>Johns</HI> day, at ten a clock in the night; and that he would open the Gate unto them, provided they came without noise, to the Gate


<PB N="28" REF="000119_0031_0FA02A6478D11EC8"/>
of the Cross. Then this Purveyour returned unto the City, and comforted the King, telling him, That he had well ordered his business; and that within fifteen dayes they should have a recruit of Victuals and Souldiers. When the day was come, he told the Watch, That this night their aid and victuals should come; and therefore when they saw them approach, that they should take heed that they made no noise, but be very quiet. At the very time appointed, at ten a clock in the night, the Gate was opened, and the enemy entred. They kill'd the Sentinels, and the <HI>Corps du Gard,</HI> having got the Word. Being thus entred into the City, the Trumpets sound an Alarm; suddenly the King and his men put themselves into a posture to fight, and to repulse the enemy back again to the Gate, which was now shut by some of the Citizens. The enemies without broke up the Gates; for they heard how they charged upon their people within: and being now entred in, they display their Colours. Those of the City abode the brunt a little at first, and were drawn up in the Market place: the Battel was very great. The King, <HI>Knipperdoling</HI> and <HI>Crechting,</HI> were taken: then <HI>Rotman</HI> seeing no hope to escape, thrust himself into the middle of the enemies, and there was run through, because he feared to be taken alive. But when the Anabaptists heard that their King was taken, their courage failed them, and they hid themselves here and there in Cellars, holes and Shop-bulks; yea, if it had been possible, would have ran into mouse-holes. They were ten dayes in pillaging the City, and they found in the Kings Pa∣lace provision for 200 men for two Moneths: whereas the poor people were for a long time starved. This was called, <HI>To have things in common</HI>; when as some had to eat, and others were starved. This was like <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI>'s dealing before the Apostle <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the City of <HI>Munster</HI> taken, the 25 of <HI>June</HI> 1535. The King was three days after, by a guard of Souldiers brought to a Castle three leagues from the City, called <HI>Dulme.</HI> As soon as the Bishop perceived the King, he cried out, Oh thou wretch! how hast thou brought spoil and waste to me, and to my poor


<PB N="29" REF="000119_0032_0FA02A6522FA9AE8"/>
people! The King readily and proudly answered, lifting up himself, and despising the Bishop, said, <HI>Priest, we have not dam∣nified thee one mite, but we have delivered a strong City into thine hands, which is able to stand out against all strength: yet if We have done thee damage, if thou wilt hearken unto us, we will make make thee rich.</HI> The Bishop hearing that, could not forbear laughing, and asked him, how he would do it? The King an∣swered him, <HI>Get Baskets made of Iron, and cover them over with Leather, and put me in one of them, and cause me to be carried through the Country, and let no man see me, but he that shall give thee a peny; and by this means, thou shalt receive more money then thou hast spent in the War.</HI></P>
<P>The better and most holy Anabaptists hung about their necks the mark and ensign of their King engraven in Brass, marked with these three letters, <HI>D. W. E.</HI> which in their language signified, <HI>The Word was made Flesh.</HI> The King had for his Title, <HI>I John by the grace of God, and by vertue of the new Kingdome to come in the Temple of God, Minister of Righteousness, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the King with his two Companions were carried Pri∣soners here and there unto the Princes, by which means the Ministers of the <HI>Lantgrave</HI> had opportunity to confer with the King, and to dispute with him about the principal Points, <HI>viz.</HI> The Kingdome of Christ, The Magistrate, Baptism, The Incar∣nation of our Lord, The Lords Supper, Marriage: and by testimonies of Scripture unto them, so acted, as though in all things they changed not: notwithstanding all the oppositions they made to defend their opinions, yet they yielded somewhat; which the King did (as some thought) in hope to save his life: for at the second time of their return, he promised them, if they would grant him his liberty, to silence the Anabaptists, which were in great numbers in <HI>Holland, Brabant, England,</HI> and <HI>Friseland,</HI> and to bring them in subjection to the Magi∣strate.</P>
<P>The 20 of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1536. the King and his two Companions were brought back to <HI>Munster,</HI> and put in several Prisons; the two next dayes were spent in holy Remonstrances, to reduce


<PB N="30" REF="000119_0033_0FA02A658A643F70"/>
them from their errours. The King acknowledged his sin, and had recourse to Christ by prayer: the other two acknowledged not their faults, but stood out. The next day the King was brought forth upon a Scaffold, and tied to a post; where were two executioners with hot burning tongs: he indured the three first pinchings of the tongs, without speaking word; afterward he ceased not to call upon the mercy of the Lord. Thus for a whole hour and more, was he torn and dismembred; and to dispatch him out of the world, he was run through with a sword: his two Companions had the like end. Their bodies were put into iron Cages, and hung upon S. <HI>Lamberts</HI> Tower, for a perpetual memorial. Let none think we recite stories of the Anabaptists, which are not to be believed, by adding there∣unto of our own; God forbid that we should so do: for there are many yet living, who were eye-witnesses of these things, and present when they were done. I speak this, that none might be hindred from getting profit by this History, which is true and certain, and brought to light for the instruction of <HI>the people of God.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1535. upon the 3 of <HI>February,</HI> in the City of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> in the street of the <HI>Salines,</HI> in the house of one <HI>John Silert,</HI> who then was far from home, there assembled seven men and five women, then called Anabaptists, among whom there was one called <HI>Theodore Sartor,</HI> who was there inspired; he lay stretched out flat upon the ground, for some space of time, before the other brethren and sisters: who in the end a∣wakened; and prayer being made with great gravity, or rather fair hypocrisie, he then said, That he had seen God in his Maje∣sty; also that he had a vision of all things in heaven and in hell; and that the great day of Judgement was now come: Afterwards he pulled off all his garments, not leaving so much as to cover his shameful parts withall. He commanded the rest of his brethren and sisters to follow his example, upon this pre∣tence, for said he, <HI>The children of God must strip themselves, and put off▪ whatsoever is made and born of the earth; inasmuch as truth is naked, and cannot abide to be wrapped up in any thing:


<PB N="31" REF="000119_0034_0FA02A6646B1E9B8"/>
therefore, to shew themselves veritable and true, ought to unclothe themselves.</HI> The poor people hearing this, put off their clothes; and being no wayes ashamed, became quite naked. <HI>Theodore</HI> commanded them all to imitate him: he leapt out of doors in∣to the publick quite naked, as also did the rest of the men and women, who followed him, crying after an horrible manner, <HI>Wo, wo, wo, Divine vengeance, Divine vengeance, &amp;c.</HI> and in this manner they ran furiously through the City, like mad peo∣ple, crying out so hideously as never was known.</P>
<P>Then the Citizens ran to take arms (for they knew not whe∣ther the City were surprized by enemies, or what would be∣come of this stir.) Finally, these impudent people were taken being quite naked; and being questioned upon the 5 of <HI>March,</HI> these seven men were beaten and scourged: the first of them cried out, <HI>Praise the Lord for evermore</HI>: another said, <HI>Lord, avenge the blood of thine</HI>: the third, <HI>Open your eyes, &amp;c.</HI> the fourth said, <HI>Wo, wo.</HI> Afterwards the women were brought to punishment: when they were taken, they offered them gar∣ments, but they rejected them, saying, <HI>That the truth ought to be naked.</HI> What men ever heard of such impudency or fury? In the ancient stories we reade of <HI>Adamites,</HI> who also went na∣ked; but it was only among themselves, and at their Festival dayes: but these far surpass them.</P>
<P>When <HI>Adam</HI> saw himself naked, he sought for covering; and finding nothing more fit then leaves, he made use of those of a Figtree: but these, when as garments were tendred unto them, they refused them; and like dogs ran without shame. Behold what befalleth those that leave the word of God, to cleave unto dreams and Satanical illusions! but behold their madness, in that they dare attribute so much villany unto the holy Spirit of God, and to make him the author of their na∣kedness: they ought to have in remembrance, with what gra∣vity the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> commandeth women to have their heads covered in the Church: what would he have said if he had seen or known women to run without shame quite naked like Bitches, who commanded that women apparel themselves in de∣cent


<PB N="32" REF="000119_0035_0FA02A66F8306E10"/>
habit, with shamefac'dness and modesty?</P>
<P>The things which were done by these Anabaptists in the Towns of St. <HI>Gall</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> are not less hideous nor hor∣rible then these, whereof we have already heard. For in the year 1526, two brethren which came out of the same womb, <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Leonard Schitker,</HI> inhabiting neer unto the town called <HI>Mulleg</HI>; the 7. of <HI>February,</HI> by night there assembled a great number of Anabaptists in their Fathers house, who spent all the night in preaching and doing marvelous deeds, and re∣ceiving of visions: at Sun-rising, upon the 8 of <HI>February, Tho∣mas</HI> took his brother <HI>Leonard,</HI> and set him in the midst of his kindred, and of all the company, commanding him to fall down upon his knees: now as the rest admonished him, to do no un∣beseeming thing unto his Brother, he answered them, That they needed not to fear, for he should do nothing there, but the will of the Father: in the mean while unsheathing a Sword he cut off his brothers head, who was upon his knees before them all. As all the company were smitten with great fear, and made great and lamentable complaints, <HI>Thomas</HI> who had com∣mitted this Murther, suddenly flyeth out of the Town, using horrible behaviours, as the custom of the Anabaptists is to do.</P>
<P>This Enthusiast at that time came before the Consul in the town of St. <HI>Gall.</HI> Mr. <HI>Joachim Vadian,</HI> an excellent man and re∣nowned for piety and learning, being present, this Anabaptist cryed out fearfully before him, <HI>The day of the Lord is at hand, the day of the Lord cometh:</HI> he added further, that at the break of day, there had been some great thing done, (but that he concealed the matter) and that the will of the Father was ac∣complished, and that it had been steeped in Gall and Vinegar: the Consul reproved him, and chid him sharply, because of his fury and immoderate cryes, commanding him to cloath him∣self, and to return to his house, and to behave himself peaceably. Suddenly his villanous murther was divulged, and he was ap∣prehended and diligently examined by torture; and afterwards for his villanous fact, by the hand of the Magistrate executed and put to death. This poor Anabaptist had forgot the Do∣ctrine


<PB N="33" REF="000119_0036_0FA02A67C4645FD8"/>
of the Apostle, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.12, &amp;c. but God by his righte∣ous judgement and providence, suffered such villanous and exe∣crable deeds to be committed by these persons, that these wayes may be abominated.</P>

<P>That befalleth these persons, which is common to such as once stray, and turn aside from the right path, and the good old way: by how much further they are off and distant from the right path, and the more progress they make; so much the farther do they wander from the right way: after that they had built the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> God so confounded their lan∣guage, that they understood not one another; and they are divided among themselves, yea, they have damned and excom∣municated one another, and made divers Churches apart, with∣out familiarity or communion together.

<PB N="34" REF="000119_0037_0FA02A68589E5670"/>Let us now come to behold some of their strange opinions; for that were a work never to be done, to describe them all. We shall begin with <HI>Thomas Muntzer,</HI> of whom mention was made in the beginning of the History.</P>
<P>Firstly, He wrote and taught publickly, that the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel, were not sent of God: and that they preached not the true word of God, but were Scribes and Pharisees, preaching only the dead Letter of the Scri∣pture.</P>
<P>Moreover, he said, That the writing of the Old Testament, and the preaching of the eternal word, was not the word of God, but was only the testimony thereof: and that we must search for the word in the internal part, <HI>i. e.</HI> in our hearts, where God hath put it, that we need not go far to seek it from without us: The Scribe-Ministers (saith he) think that faith cometh by the Scriptures and preaching, but they are very far off: for all the Scriptures lead us hither, that we must be taught and learned of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.45. <HI>Isai.</HI> 54.13. <HI>Jer</HI> 31.34.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>It was very needful for these Anabaptists, to begin here to set up their Sect and Faction: they must say and plainly affirm, that the Ministers are not sent of God, that they might the more withdraw the poor people from them. The Reasons which move them so to speak, as they pretend, are <HI>Pauls</HI> writing to <HI>Timothy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim</HI> 4.12.</NOTE> where he saith, <HI>Be an Example,</HI> &amp;c. where∣by the Apostle sheweth it is needful for the Minister to approve his calling by purity of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2.</NOTE> otherwise it will be vain and false; also the Bishop must be unblameable. Our new Mennonists and Franniques are of the same opinion. But in the mean while, who seeth not that they endeavour above all things, to set up their own works and righteousnesses, and Pharisee-like to judge &amp; condemn all such as do not as many works as they? It is many times so, that Harlots will boast themselves more of their chastity then honest Matrons: so it was with the false A∣postles at <HI>Corinth,</HI> that they might bring the true Apostles of Christ into disrepute; they so boasted of their own vertue and lowliness, as if the true Apostles were in no wise to be compa∣red


<PB N="35" REF="000119_0038_0FA02A6A47DED4E0"/>
with them. But the Apostle is in no wise astonished at their vain and foolish braggings; yea, he plainly derided them, saying, <HI>We dare not make ours of the number, nor compare our selves with some who commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise:</HI> as if the Apostle should have said, they so please them∣selves in themselves, that they think and esteem, that there are none in the World equal or to be compared with themselves: they consider not the gifts wherewith others are endued, but their sight is so fixed upon themselves and their own fair deeds, as that they are perswaded, that they are the only ones, and the None-such in the world. In the mean while, the Apostle lively upbraideth them, saying, Such false Apostles are deceitful work∣ers, disguising themselves into Apostles of Christ; and no marvel, saith he, for Satan transformeth himself into an Angel of light; it is no great matter then, if his Ministers trans∣form themselves into the Ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works. Moreover, who know∣eth not well, that Doctrine far surpasseth works? so as if the Doctrine be not sound, pure, and true; the works, how holy and fair soever they may be, will never prove the calling of a false Prophet, that he is sent from God.</P>
<P>If it were lawful for us to boast, it should not be in our san∣ctity, perfection, and mortification, as they do; but onely in the pure mercy of God through Jesus Christ: if so be that gravity and honesty of life, were the true sign of the vocation to the Ministry, it would follow, that all honest and good peo∣ple should be Ministers of the Church; but that is well known to be false, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10. nor can it be; for there is a command for <HI>every one to walk in the calling wherein he is called,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.29. He asketh also, <HI>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</HI> Every Christian may or ought to reade, and dis∣course of Scripture; it followeth not therefore that all Chri∣stians are Preachers and Ministers of the Churches, but onely those which are lawfully called; nor doth the calling cease for any failing that may be found in the life of the Called (which is


<PB N="36" REF="000119_0039_0FA02A6A76076FA8"/>
not spoken to give occasion to make Ministers negligent; (God forbid:) but the exhortation of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> is alwayes necessary to the Ministers) no more then <HI>Peter</HI> ceased to be a true and lawful Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 6 6. <HI>Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 13 3. 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5 22. 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 4 14. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1 6</NOTE> when he so grosly failed, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11, 12. It is well known our Ministers are called to Office by the voice and common consent of all the Church; and that after fasting and calling upon the Name of God, according to Apostolical institution, and are confirmed in their Office by imposition of hands: what reason is there for these Sectaries to say, That their Ministers are called of God, but ours onely by the world and men? if their Ministers have a special calling as the Apo∣stles had, let them prove it by signs, miracles, gifts of tongues, and Apostolical Doctrine, as they did: The Church hath no need of your Ministers; for the Doctrine of Repentance, A∣mendment of life, and of Remission of sins in the Name of Christ, is abundantly declared in the Church of Christ: to teach the same thing is superfluous; if you teach any other Do∣ctrine, then you and your Doctrine is accursed, and not to be heard.</P>
<P>I shall say no other thing, then what the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> before spake to the like glorious Ministers as theirs be, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.18. If their spirit be so full of knowledge and light, so as they cannot contain themselves from preaching without calling; why do they not preach where the Gospel was never yet declared? they insinuate themselves into such places, where the Gospel hath been preached to the people, with great labour and hazard of life unto the poor Ministers. It is a marvel, how they will vouch∣safe to enjoy, and partake of the labours of those Ministers, whom they so much hate: they secretly by fraud and deceit se∣duce and disturb in such places the poor sheep of Jesus Christ, which ought not to be withdrawn from their true Pastors. I pray all the Flock of Christ, not to give heed to such strangers, but rather hearken to the voice of the Apostle, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5.12, 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17.</P>
<P>These Sectaries do defame and reproach the Ministers, and speak all evil of them▪ but it is because they touch them at the


<PB N="37" REF="000119_0040_0FA02A6B2CF5AC90"/>
quick; because they cry out upon these Wolves, and pluck the sheep-skins from off their backs, that none might be surprized by their fair appearance. Seeing the Gospel-Ministers are styled <HI>Salt of the earth,</HI> none must think strange that the Salt biteth and pricketh, and maketh it self to be Salt: the Salt biteth not where there is no wound, but it is felt where there is a raw place. It will appear then, that they have lost their spiritual senses, who say, That <HI>our Ministers are not called of God:</HI> God hath put singular honour upon the Ministers; yea, what greater could he put upon them, then by saying, <HI>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me?</HI> the Lord not only by words, hath recommended the Ministers unto the Church; but also by example, hath shewn what honour and reverence all ought to have them in. The holy Ghost could have taught the Ethiopian Eunuch without the Ministry of man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 8.</NOTE> but he would maintain this order.</P>
<P>So <HI>Cornelius,</HI> God could have taught him by the Angel,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 10.5.</NOTE> but he is bid to send for <HI>Peter.</HI> When our Lord called <HI>Paul,</HI> he could have instructed him himself, yet he is sent to a mortal man, to receive the Doctrine of Salvation, and Baptism: be∣hold, a case which fell not out by rashness, that an Angel of God should withdraw from entring upon the Ministry,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts.</HI> 9 6.</NOTE> and should send him to a man, a Minister, to preach unto him. Who with a good Conscience dare then despise the true Ministry, so highly honoured of God; and to disgust men from the same, and to cause men to run after those which were not lawful Mi∣nisters, but thieves, robbers, and grievous Wolves, which spare not the flock of our Lord Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>Let us now come to the second Point: <HI>Muntzer,</HI> after he had spued out his poison against the poor Ministers of Christ, he falls upon the word of the eternal God; and there, that he may leave nothing intire, with open throat he spits out his blasphemies. It is no marvel if he fall upon the Ministers of the Word, to speak evil of them, seeing he dareth so outragi∣ously to set himself against the very mouth of God▪ Behold his own words.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>We plainly confess, and are not so ignorant (thanks be to God) and who knoweth not, that the external word, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the Letters written with ink upon paper, by the hand of the Writer; and that the voice sounding out of the mouth, is not the Word of God, inasmuch as it is written and spoken by man? yet we do notwithstanding affirm, that the sense of these words written, and spoken by the mouth of the Minister, is the true and indubitable Word of God: as it more plainly ap∣peareth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 36.4.6, 8.</NOTE> where the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> commandeth <HI>Baruch</HI> to write from his mouth <HI>all the words of the Lord.</HI> The words of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> written with ink in a Book, are called the Word of the Lord.</P>
<P>How often do we hear in the Prophets, <HI>Thus saith the Lord!</HI> reade these Scriptures: <HI>Jer.</HI> 25.15. <HI>Jer.</HI> 20.33. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Isa.</HI> 40.6. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Deut.</HI> 10.18. <HI>Acts</HI> 4.31. <HI>Acts</HI> 6.2. <HI>Acts</HI> 8.14, 25. <HI>Acts</HI> 11.1. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.5, 7, 25. <HI>Acts</HI> 17.13. <HI>Acts</HI> 18.11. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.7. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.13. We ought rather to give credit to so many evident Testimonies of Scripture, then unto such Ravers, who do nothing but rave and dream.</P>
<P><HI>Muntzer</HI> careth not for that, but dareth give the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> the lye. Now they which leave the Scriptures, finding out another means to come unto God, through pride, they are deprived of their senses. They pretend unto Revelations of the Spirit; and despising all reading, they mock at the simple∣ness of those, which yet follow the dead and killing Letter (as they call it.) By what spirit is it, by inspiration whereof they are so highly rapt, as that they dare reject all the Doctrine of the Scriptures, as a babish and childish thing? They say, <HI>It is the Spirit of God</HI>; but it is plain mockery so to speak. For


<PB N="39" REF="000119_0042_0FA02A6CB735F8E0"/>
they must needs grant us, that the Apostles and the faithful in the Primitive Church, were inspired by the Spirit of Christ; yet none of them durst contemn the Word of God, and the holy Scriptures, but rather each of them had them in very great reverence; as we may see it by their writings, which are furnished with many testimonies from the Old Testament: and certainly thus was it promised by God, through the mouth of the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.21. where we see, that the Lord joyn∣ed these two together, his <HI>Word</HI> and his <HI>Spirit:</HI> wherefore should we separate, what God hath by an inviolable bond con∣joyned?</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Paul,</HI> who was rapt up into the third heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.4.</NOTE> and there heard things unlawful for man to utter, notwith∣standing, gave not over diligent reading, nor profiting by the Books of the Old Testament, Commanding <HI>Timothy</HI> to bring with him the Books which he had left at <HI>Troas</HI> with <HI>Carpus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.13. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.13.</NOTE> Yea, he exhorts <HI>Timothy,</HI> who though he was an excellent Teacher, and well instructed in the holy Scriptures, to give himself to reading: and what praise doth he put upon the Scri∣pture! 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16.

<HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>The letter killeth, and the Spirit quickeneth</HI>; let any closely consider, against whom the Apostle disputeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3 6.</NOTE> and they will understand his drift. It is very evident that <HI>Paul</HI> in this place, had to do with false Apostles, who preached and extolled the Law without Christ, and caused the people to recoil from Salvation purchased by Christ, and the grace of the new Cove∣nant, whereunto the Lord had promised to write his Law in the heart of the faithful:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jer</HI> 31.33. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11.19. <HI>Ezek</HI> 36. <HI>Heb</HI> 8.10.</NOTE> the Law then being separated from Christ, as a body without a soul; and nothing cometh from it but death, to those that are under it: it doth nothing but beat and strike the ears, without any quickening the soul, until by faith we are sent from it unto Christ, as from the Usher unto the Master; and then the Law will be found such as <HI>David</HI> sings it, <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is faithful, making wise the simple:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 19 8.</NOTE> <HI>the com∣mandments of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart,</HI> &amp;c. Thus must we understand how it is said, The Letter killeth: <HI>Paul</HI> calleth the Law, The killing Letter, and saith, The Spirit quick∣neth; <HI>i. e.</HI> The Ministry of the Gospel, which he opposeth unto the naked Law; and he himself calleth his preaching, The Ministry of the Spirit: we must not understand this place as those dreamers, who as often as they meet with an obscure place that maketh against them, say, The Letter killeth, <HI>i. e.</HI> Ac∣cording as they say, to understand the meaning of this Scri∣pture this killeth, but we must come to the Spirit, <HI>i. e.</HI> to forge Allegories. <HI>Paul</HI> never thought of such fopperies, as we may see in reading the same Chapter, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.8.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 24 27.</NOTE> It is then wret∣chedly and wickedly done, to cast off the Scripture upon such pretence of the Spirit, seeing our Lord giveth us his Spirit to understand his word: as we see Christ opened the understand∣ing of the two Disciples, not by making them wise in them∣selves, nor setting them to look for a new kinde of word, or natural and innate in them, in rejecting the Scriptures; but that they might understand the Scriptures. After this manner the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> exhorteth the Thessalonians not to quench the Spirit: he would not have them fly in the air, after vain and un∣profitable

So the word of God, if it fall upon the hard and rebellious brain, it remaineth without fruit, as upon stony soil: but upon a heart prepared by the operation of the Holy Ghost, then it brings forth much fruit; and as the Husband-man when he hath sown his seed, he can do no more, he cannot make his grain to grow, but leaveth it to God: so must the Ministers do; when they have preached and sown the Word of God, they cannot make it grow, they must commend it unto God: as the Apostle saith, <HI>He that planteth is nothing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor</HI> 3.7.</NOTE> <HI>and he that watereth is nothing, but it is God that must give the increase:</HI> he doth not therefore reject him that plant∣eth, nor him that watereth, that is to say, the external Mini∣sters; for he soon addeth, We are co-workers or labourers with God; ye are Gods husbandry, ye are Gods building. It appeareth that the Ministers are joyned in the work with God; inasmuch as God maketh use of them as instruments, and he worketh by his word, by giving vertue in the internal man: one may see as plainly as day-light, the errour of <HI>Muntzer,</HI> the first father of these Anabaptists, and that there is no rea∣son in his speech.</P>

notwithstanding there be others who maintain this opinion, or rather blasphemy, as some strange spirits, the disciples of <HI>Se∣bastian Franque,</HI> who this day do renew the question: yea, some little space of time since, one of the chief of that Sect, whose name I shall forbear to declare, in the City of <HI>Frankfort,</HI> before several honest people told me, and with might and main maintained, with divers of his disciples, That the earth never bare a more abominable Idol, then that which is called the <HI>Bible</HI>; and that all the World doted upon it, looking therein for the word of God, whereas we should look for it in our hearts: and one of them redoubled it, and said in the presence of Mr. <HI>Alosco</HI> and of us all, What do you talk so much of the Scripture! I assure you on my part, I have learned more by seeing a Hen or a Capon killed, then ever I learned by all the Sermons and Lectures of the Books that ever I read. Unto whom I answered, It must needs be that you eat often of Hens and Capons, seeing you have learned so much by their death: but I pray you, said I, What good did you ever learn thereby? he answered, That he had learned to know, the obedience which Jesus Christ rendred unto God his Father upon the Cross: and that as the fowl was slain without making resistance, and that for the good and life of man; so was Jesus Christ slain for the life of mankinde: it was said then unto him, How do you know that ever there was such an one as Jesus Christ, and that he died for man? do you finde that written in the Capons belly? the Turks also do kill Capons, but they cannot reade there, that Christ was their Saviour. In the end they were ve∣ry angry, and like people deprived of their sences, when they were hampered by the word of God, and by their own reasons. What man is there that would not wonder at such foolish and irrational discourse? is it not just that such people should be so handled, seeing they have rejected the word of the living God, which the Angels themselves desire to pry into, that they should be sent to School unto the bruit beasts.</P>

When Christ saith, we must be as little chil∣dren, it is not said, We must be Children, and become foolish; but that we should imitate the plainness and integrity which is in little children; and that is it which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> holds forth, when he saith, <HI>Be not children in understanding, but in ma∣lice, &amp;c.</HI> in understanding be men: and every where in the Scriptures, their wandrings and vagations are condemned; for he saith, <HI>Whosoever taketh not care of his own,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.8.</NOTE> &amp;c <HI>And let every one abide in the calling wherein he is called,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Spiritual Anabaptists, who are separted from the world.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the Anabaptists who call themselves <HI>Separated from the world,</HI> and are wholly spiritual; they say, They will have nothing in common with the Gentiles, as they call them, not Fasting, observation of dayes, life, eating and drinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These establish a rule how plain their garments must be, of what stuff, how long, how large, of what matter, and how for manner: they forbid the use of all costly garments, calling such as use them Gentiles, and Pagans: when they see any laugh or be cheerful, they cry, <HI>Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall weep.</HI> They fetch continual deep sighs, and are alwayes sad, they reject all feastings and banquets at Weddings, all use of Musick; and as for that speech, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.1. they have it al∣wayes in their mouthes, <HI>Fashion not your selves unto the world:</HI> they alledge it, as if the Apostle had intended to change the nature and property of all things, and as if so be he com∣manded us to go upon our heads, because the Gentiles go up∣on their feet; or to speak with our feet, and hear with our heels, because the Gentiles speak with their mouthes, and hear with their ears. Whereas the Apostle understandeth no other thing, then that we should not imitate the world in that which is evil; which the Apostle <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world:</HI> for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expoundeth this, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.17. when he chargeth us that we should <HI>not walk as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their understandings.</HI> It is folly in them to draw these words from the true sense, to make them condemn a multitude of things indifferent; as some of them will not put on a clean shirt upon <HI>Sunday,</HI> be∣cause unbelievers do so: some will not call <HI>Munday</HI> or <HI>Tues∣day,</HI> but the first and second day of the week; binding their

Consciences unto such things: they make themselves ridicu∣lous, because they condemn garments and trimmings, which are not according to their Cut and Rule, by their Taylors, and according to their patern and fashion. We would not here let loose the reins to pomp and vanity, but we say, We are not to condemn him, who is clothed according to his Estate, and according to the custom of the Country; yong people &amp; all according to the received custom, Gentlemen according to their ranks, Merchants, and consequently all men of Estate accord∣ing to their qualities. We condemn, with the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> all sumptuousness, and vanities which are unprofitable: not∣withstanding we say, That when Princes and the like carry it magnificently, they are not to be condemned as Pagans; for Christ and his Apostles never gave us Rules for our garments. Let every one hold forth mediocrity, and cut off all superfluity, for the profit of the poor. Meat &amp; drink is not less free to Chri∣stians, then garments, wherefore to forbid them, is to hold forth the Doctrine of Devils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.</NOTE> as <HI>Paul</HI> saith. What hurt can be found therein? when God shall by his blessing give a Christian means, that he may make use of good meat and drink; and the faithful receive it with giving of thanks, without gluttony, but with sobri∣ety: wherefore should any say, That this gift of God is a curse? Have not the servants of the Lord, praised the Lord for it? as <HI>David</HI> for the Lords filling of his Cup,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> and spreading his Table. Was not Christ at Feasts and banquets with his friends? there were none but the hypocritical Pharisees of∣fended at it, calling him Glutton and Drunkard. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>He could tell how to abound, as well as to want.</HI> If a believer hath little, let him be contented without murmuring; if he hath much, let him use it with moderation and sobriety, and giving of thanks; remembring that passage of the Apostle, <HI>Whether you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.</HI> They con∣demn all mirth and laughter as bad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor.</HI> 10.21.</NOTE> It is true, Christ saith, <HI>Woe unto you that laugh, for you shall mourn:</HI> yet <HI>Paul</HI> exhort∣eth to rejoyce with them that rejoyce; and <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>There is a time to laugh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 12:14.</NOTE> Eccles. 3. <HI>Abraham</HI> laughed, <HI>Genes.</HI> 18.10.

and yet these men would banish all mirth and laughter. All civil mirth is not to be condemned, nay, rather their hypocri∣tical sighings, and their sad and melancholy looks, are to be censured, whereby they would, as more holy, extol them∣selves above other men: the Kingdome of God consists not in these things; the Scripture no where condemneth honest mirth, but every where hypocrisies. In the time of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Israel held a Feast for fourteen dayes together, because of all the goodness of God vouchsafed to <HI>David</HI> his father. As mourn∣ing proceeds from adversity, so joy from prosperity: which <HI>Jeremiah</HI> plainly holds forth, when he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lam.</HI> 5.1.</NOTE> <HI>The joy of our heart is ceased, and our mirth is turned into mourning,</HI> &amp;c. They condemn also the honest banquets at Weddings, as unlawful and evil; and yet we see the Scripture speaketh often of the voice of the Spouse and espoused: we reade it no where con∣demned, either in the Old or New Testament. Our Lord was not onely at a Wedding being invited, but wrought there his first Miracle, by turning water into wine: he sate down there, and his Disciples.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>God hath made wine to make glad mans heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 104 1,</NOTE> <HI>and oyl to make his face shine:</HI> Feasts and Banquets which exceed Christian modesty, are not to be commended. <HI>Lot</HI> made a feast to his two guests; and <HI>Abraham</HI> did so at <HI>Isaacs</HI> weaning: who ever will reade of the feast of the faithful, let him reade these Scriptures; <HI>Gen.</HI> 26.30. <HI>Gen.</HI> 43.34. <HI>Judg.</HI> 14 10, 12, 17. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.20. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 3.15. <HI>Job</HI> 1.4, 5. It is said, <HI>Matthew</HI> made a feast, where many Publicans were: Christ doth not forbid them, yea, he fetcheth a comparison from the Bride and Bridegroom, from the Wedding-Supper, and the Wedding-Garments.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 14</NOTE> We would not here encourage intemperance in any, but to shew the liberty which Christians have of the good Creatures of God, that none may condemn those, who in Gods fear do make use of their liberty: the Kingdom of God lieth not in such observations; bodily exercise profiting little, but godliness being profitable in all things.

<PB N="56" REF="000119_0059_0FA02A892CDAC5D8"/>There be some who hold re-baptizing so necessary as that without it none can be saved: Nor will they salute any, nor give the hand, nor acknowledge any but such to be their bre∣thren: some hold it not so necessary, and make no scruple to be found with honest people, and to account them as brethren: but their number is but small.</P>
<P>Some account Childrens Baptism so bad, as that they will ra∣ther be dismembred, and suffer, then to let their Children be baptized. Others suffer it as an Ordinance, which neither hindreth nor profiteth. Some account themselves holy and pure; these are separated from others, and have all things in common; none saith among them, <HI>This is mine:</HI> and to have any thing in propriety, is accounted a sin. Some have endured great torments, because they would not keep <HI>Sundaies</HI> and Festi∣val dayes, in despite of Antichrist: seeing they were dayes ap∣pointed by Antichrist, they would not hold forth any thing which is like unto him. Others observe these dayes, but it is out of charity.</P>
<P>Some say they are come so high, as that they cannot sin any more. The most pure of them preach up the Cross, and per∣secution so high, that they seem to make it an Idol, and a new Saviour, putting of it in the place of Christ, for salvation, as the Papists do their works. There be some who have daily some new command from God, to make known unto their bre∣thren and strangers. Some are rapt into an extasie, and have their visage and countenance changed, lying upon the ground certain hours. Some Tremble and Quake for two or three hours together: after that, when they are come unto them∣selves, they prophecie and speak strange things, as if they had been in another world, or as if they had fallen from out of heaven:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> and they account to have that in common with the Apostle, when he was taken up into the third heaven.</P>
<P>Many cannot speak nor declare the great secrets, and Myste∣ries which they have seen.</P>
<P>To so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this Extasie or Trance cometh often, to others not so often, to others of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not at all. Some among them fall

down upon their faces, and dream; others do not; but keep themselves to the Letter of the Scripture. Some do nothing else but pray as the Friers do, and say, That they do hinder and keep back, by their prayers, all the mischief which other∣wise would befal the world: these will not that evil should be resisted by any other wayes then by prayers; and in no sort will permit the use of arms.</P>
<P><HI>John Denk</HI> did not admit of swearing by way of witness. Some hold not the Trinity of persons in one Essence, saying, That the Son only is a person. Some esteem of the Sacrament of the Lords supper as we do; but they preach it up so highly, as that it will be very hard to finde so much as two fit to com∣municate therein; and therefore some are of opinion not to do it until their death. In some places they banish and excommuni∣cate all those, which will heare any Preacher or Minister preach: they speak all the evil of them that may be, calling them Scribes and Pharisees. Others endure that one may hear, see, and read any thing: but in the mean while the manner of Ministers living pleaseth them not. They have the Cross in such esti∣mation, that they despise and reject all those which are without it, and persecution, and say, That their case is not good▪ for (say they) if they were in the Lords way, they would suffer persecution: some therefore seek the Cross, others are of another opinion. And many times they break fair housholds by separating the parties, when one of the parties is excom∣municated, the party which is not excommunicated must with∣draw from the other party: and their excommunications are for very small matters; yea, when they are married one to another, they make them promise, that if one of them come to be cast out of the Church, that the innocent party shall with∣draw from the nocent; and by this means their marriages are all conditional: when one is thus separated, the party offen∣ded cannot be remarried, if the other party being married be not delivered by the death of his adjoynt: yea, some∣times it falls out, that some who have been excommunicated, are received in again, and finde their party married to another;

and there they must see their wives before their eyes to be unto another man, and they themselves cannot remarry; yea though they have not the gift of continence, they say unto them, as unto the Friers, that they must make themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of heaven. Behold how the Devil makes him∣self sport with these men! They are in mortal war with the Franiques: upon this occasion the Mennonists have excom∣municated the Franiques, because they would not approve of these goodly marriages.</P>
<P>They say also, That when a man hath sinned, though he doth repent, that he is to be excommunicated: and then if he doth persevere therein, he shall be received in again. Behold, the fair stir of Satan, how he playeth the game with these men, which follow not the true light of the Gospel. Our Lord be pleased to give eyes to all the World, that they may take heed of these Sects, which make men turn aside from the way of truth. So be it.</P>
