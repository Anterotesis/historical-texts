<HEAD>To the Flock of the Lord Jesus, IN <HI>East-Hampton,</HI> Under my Pastoral Care</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following <HI>Narrative</HI> made publick by the <HI>Press,</HI> to others in general, is dedicated to you in particular. 'Tis now about Twenty Years, since I first began to minister to you in divine Things: During which Space of Time (through the Goodness of God) I have not been prevented by Indisposition, from Preaching to you, so much as one Sabbath. What my Labours have been, and what the Success of them, is better known to you, than to others. I have great Reason to cry out, My Leaness! My Leaness! At the same Time in the View of what God hath wrought, and is effecting by the late and present plentiful Effusion of his blessed Spirit, I would join with you, in undissembled Praises, unto him, <HI>whose Mercy endureth for ever,</HI> that the Word of his Truth, hath been so pros∣perous, in the Day of his Power. Unless the Lord in a very unusual Manner continues to pour out his Spirit upon <HI>us,</HI> 'tis highly
<PB N="ii" REF="010250_0004_0F7E255CF4253E40"/>
probable, that some of you, who have had only superficial Awakenings; and some others, who have had more powerful Convictions; together with such as may have had only counterfeit Conversions, not having the Root of Grace within, will by and by lose your serious Impressions, and, when Temptations and Trials come, return to Sio and Folly, with additional Hardness of Heart; and some of you become notorious for Wickedness, <HI>Satan's</HI> Re-Posession being seven fold. Mean while the secure and wicked World looking on as pleased, will speak reproachfuly of the Lord's Work among us, take Occasion to justify their Infidelity, and increase their Prejudices against Religion, it may be to their eternal Ruin. Consequences sufficiently shocking, to make the many pious Walkers with God among us, (who will scarce be mentioned by the wicked World) even tremble, while they pray to, rejoice in their God, and praise Him! Alas! For you that remain Christless and Graceless in such a <HI>Day as this!</HI> My Heart bleeds within me, in the View of the perishing State of your precious Souls! Upon the dreadful Supposition, you finally go down to the Pit of outer Darkness, your eternal Misery will be immensely aggravated, by the Light of this Day! In those gloomy Regions of unutterable eternal Horror and Despair, it will be a Soul∣sinking
<PB N="iii" REF="010250_0005_0F7E255D62051B40"/>
Soul-tormenting Reflection, that in your Probation-day, the Light of Life was offer'd; but you chose the Darkness of Death. Infinitely shocking Thought! <HI>In the Bowels of Jesus,</HI> I once more beseech you all, to view the spirituality and Extent of God's holy <HI>Law,</HI> and bow to sovereign Mercy, and give the in∣finitely ever-gracious THREE, all the Glory of your Salvation to all Eternity! Relinquish every Rival of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and his finished Salva∣tion: Forsake all, and possess all,—give up all, and enjoy all, for ever.—As to those of you, who entertain Hopes, (amidst your Fears) that you <HI>have passed from Death to Life,</HI> as you aim high, and act for Eternity, examine your∣selves with accurate and impartial Scrutiny. Don't dare to presume, your State is safe, be∣cause you have had legal Terrors, and passed out of deep Distress, into high Joys; unless you experience a Renovation of Nature, fol∣lowed with Newness of Life, and a Course of vital practical Holiness. May all of you, who are verily <HI>new born,</HI> walk with God, and be∣come <HI>Imitators</HI> of him, as dear Children. Your Duty and your Happiness is inseperably connected. I can't conceive of two Kinds of Happiness in God's Universe; there is none different from, and much less opposite to, his own. The reverse is absolute Error, and cer∣tain Misery. God's infinite Blessedness arises
<PB N="iiii" REF="010250_0006_0F7E255FEFAE38F8"/>
from his Love to himself, the Propension of his Will to his own Glory, and the delightful View and Enjoyment of his own infinite Excel∣lencies. Perfectly knowing that He hath in himself, an infinite Fulness of all amiable Per∣fection and Goodness, He must needs prima∣rily, chiefly and infinitely love Himself, having an everlasting <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> complacency, and in∣finite Delight in himself, enjoying himself, in an everlasting <HI>NOW,</HI> making his own Glory his last End, in all his Designs and Operations. Those who walk with God, and are Imitators of him, as enlighten'd by the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and sanctified, according to their infinitely inferior and disproportionate Measure, see and know there is such an infinite Fulness of amiable Perfection and Excellence in God, that 'tis in∣finitely fit and reasonable they should love Him superlatively, delight in Him supremely, and act with an ultimate View to his Glory, on Ac∣count of his being what he is in Himself: And as a Fruit of divine Influence and Grace, thus they do, and thus they give Glory to the triune God, and begin to possess substantial Blessedness. For thus to know, love, enjoy, and glorify God, as our chief Good and last End, is not only our Duty, our Way to Happiness, and an Evidence, and an Effect of Holiness; but it is truely our Holiness it self, and realy our Happiness: For in Proportion thereto is
<PB N="v" REF="010250_0007_0F7E256099737120"/>
our Sanctification increased and carried on, and shall be consumate and triumphant, and Holi∣ness thus completed, will be, our eternal Bles∣sedness. Mean while, by such a Walk, we dwell in God, and dwell in Love, and the God of Love, dwells in us by his Spirit of Love. The Authority and Glory of God the <HI>Father,</HI> the Honour of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Eternal Spirit,</HI> the Interest of Religion the Good of Others, your own Comfort, and all possible infinite Obligations, require that you thus walk with God, and become constant Imitators of Him. As all depends upon divine Influence, therefore, <HI>Quench not the Spirit: Grieve not the Holy Spirit.</HI> Multitudes of the Lord's People have heard of his good Work among you, and upon hearing have rejoiced, <HI>and Glorified God in you.</HI> By Faith abide in Christ, so shall you bear much Fruit, and so will your heavenly Father be glorified. While you have seen and known such marvelous Effects of God's Word in his House, how often have you drawn this Conclusion, Surely, "the Lord is in this Place"! Surely "his Word is good; his Ways are right, and the Just shall walk in them." No doubt Satan is enraged, to behold <HI>such Spoil of his Goods</HI> and will endeavour to disgrace and throw an Odium upon this <HI>good Work.</HI> Histories will inform, that he has always attempted to obscure the Glory, and obstruct the Progress of

the Lord's Work. Be not ignorant of his Devices. Watch against and resist his Temp∣tations, as well as your inherent Corruptions, in the Strength of the Lord. Watch against spiritual Pride, as the first born of Hell, and the very image of the Devil. Take Heed left there be in you an evil Heart of Unbelief in departing from the living God. Be dead to the Love of the <HI>Honours, Profits</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> of this Life; which are the World's Trinity, but the Bane of the Life and reigning Love of God in the Soul. Constantly eye eternal Things, and make them the Grand terminating Ob∣jects of your Faith, and be ever under their governing Influence in your Lives. Watch to perform the respective Duties of your Stations, in their Number, Time and Order, and evan∣gelically as to their Manner. Live in Love as Disciples of Jesus; make Choice of each others Company, as fearing God, and let your Con∣versation be spiritual. Do all you can, in your proper Places, to engage others to go with you to Heaven. Love your <HI>Bibles,</HI> and your Closets, family Religion; private <HI>praying</HI> Meetings; and publick Ordinances: Rest not without meeting with the God of Ordinan∣ces in them. Watch against <HI>Formality,</HI> and <HI>Legality,</HI> as the grand Rivals of powerful Christianity. Be continually looking into, and diving deeper and deeper in the boundless
<PB N="vii" REF="010250_0009_0F7E2561ED6E0CF8"/>
Ocean of the Wonders of redeeming Love and Grace, appearing in the whole <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of your eternal Salvation: That Self-abasing, Self-abhorring, Soul-humbling, God exalting, Christ extolling, Spirit magnifying, free Grace adoring Thoughts, may abound continually, in all their mighty Force, in your Hearts. Keep up a perpetual Correspondency with God, by ejaculatory Prayer and Praise. Let the Glory and Love of God, inspire your Souls with unseigned Sorrow for, and Ha∣tred against all Sin. Think no more of real Merit in your best Frames, and Duties, than in your worst Sins. Always go to God, as infinitely vile unworthy Sinners, constantly making Use of <HI>Jesus the Mediator,</HI> living by Faith upon his <HI>Law</HI> fulfilling Righteousness, the Sufficiency of his Merit and Grace. Rest in no present Attainments, but seek progres∣sive Holiness, as the Way to have Love per∣fected, slavish Fear ejected, full Assurance obtained, and preserved, and growing divine Comforts multiplied. As having nothing, live constantly by Faith, upon the Word, Promises, and Oath of <HI>JEHOVAH</HI> your <HI>GOD,</HI> and let it be the Glory of your Souls, to glory only, fully and forever in Him. As Inspira∣tion, and Expiration, the Holy Spirit's breath∣ing into, and the Soul's breathing out after God, is the Life and Spirit of real Religion, con∣stantly
<PB N="viii" REF="010250_0010_0F7E25629146A350"/>
observe the Holy Spirit's Accesses and Approaches, his Recesses and Withdraws, and by each learn Dependence upon his In∣fluence and Efficiency. As in the View of your spiritual Poverty, Inability and Self-em∣tiness, seek <HI>to be filled with the Holy Spirit,</HI> that you may see more clearly, believe stronger, love more fervently, hope more steadily, war more successfully, obey more chearfully, and long more ardently for absolute Perfection. Believe the Promises and pray incessently for plentiful Effusions of the Holy Spirit upon the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ, and upon a World perishing for want of divine Light and Influence: Perishing around you by Thousands and Mil∣lions, not for want of a <HI>finished Salvation,</HI> as to meritorious Impetration or Procurement; but for want of effectual Application by the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> By what you have seen, the Lord hath taught you, how easy it is for Him, with one Turn of his Hand, with one Word of his Mouth to awaken whole Countries of stuped and sleeping Sinners, and kindle di∣vine Life in their Souls. The Lord's Work will not stop <HI>thus,</HI> "there is the Sound of abundance of Rain," in Answer to Prayer, the heavenly Influences will still be descending in immense Plenty: The <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Fame</HI> of <HI>Jesus.</HI> and his <HI>Salvation,</HI> shall be defused thro' all Tribes and Ranks of Mankind, and whole
<PB N="ix" REF="010250_0011_0F7E256595F5E708"/>
<HI>Nations</HI> shall be <HI>new born</HI> in one glorious Day of Divine Influence: And the ancient <HI>De∣crees</HI> will bring forth in their immortal Full∣ness of Blessings, and the ample Promises will unfold themselves, in their all-surprising and all-infinite Glories, in the publick Sight of Heaven and Earth. "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest, that He would <HI>thrust</HI> forth Labourers into his Harvest." Labourers filled with the Holy Spirit, that may prove the happy Instruments of "gathering in Fruit to everlasting Life." Pray much for your own Minister in particular. How can he preach in a spiritual, evangelical, and accept∣able Manner, but as the Holy Spirit conde∣sends to afford his Aid and Assistance? How successfully, but by his Co-operation and Blessing? It hath been observed by Strangers, who have often occasionally attended your private Meetings, that you ever pray much for your Minister: Go on and persevere, my dear People, in praying hard and much for him and may his Ministry among you be as <HI>Aaron'</HI>s <HI>Rod,</HI> having <HI>Buds, Blossoms,</HI> and <HI>Fruit,</HI> at the same Time! By sound Doctrine, a companied with the divine Influences, may you be built up in Faith, Holniess and Com∣fort, and continue to walk in the Truth, be∣ing knit together in one Body, in Christ with that Love which is the Bond of Perfection

<HI>here</HI> and the Glory and Felicity of the upper World.</P>
<P>As to the following <HI>Narrative,</HI> so far as <HI>human Observation</HI> and <HI>Testimony,</HI> can give an Assurance of Truth; I may justly say, <HI>I have written,</HI> what most of you know, and testify what, in its genuine and powerful Ef∣fects, you have seen: And as to the Sub∣stance of the Lord's Work therein narrated, what a very considerable Number of you, profess to be experimentally acquainted with. While I have verily thought, I ought not to be silent; but to declare these <HI>Things</HI> thus publickly, "to the Glory of Him, who work∣eth all Things according to the Counsel of his own Will," I persuade myself, that many of you are very sensible, that the Favours, of the World can't make you happy, nor its Frowns make you miserable: "That the Fa∣vour of your God is Life, and his Loving Kindness better than Life," and that you long for that State of Glory, where we shall dwell for ever <HI>near him,</HI> and be for ever blessed. I hope <HI>this Naritive,</HI> will abide in your Houses, and be often and seriously read over by you and yours, as a <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Lord's marvelous Work of divine Grace, <HI>in our Day;</HI> and by the Blessing of God, may it be trea∣sured up in your Hearts, and have its due Influence upon your Lives. May the Holy

Spirit help you to persevere in Prayer, 'till we shall yet see greater and more glorious <HI>Things</HI> than <HI>these!</HI> I now only add, may you, my dear People, one and all, from the least to the greatest, be so taught by God, as to be∣come wise to your eternal Salvation! That when I have done preaching, and you have done hearing, and both have done with Time for ever, we may rejoice together, in the Pre∣sence of our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> at his appear∣ing. To whose blessed Spirit, and Grace, I commend you all.</P>

<P>WE the Subscribers, being informed by our Rev.

And particu∣larly we would declare to the Glory of God's Grace, that there hath been a happy Revival of Religion in the Congregations committed to our pastoral Care; and that there is a con∣siderable Number in them, so far as we can judge by the Rules of God's Word, towards whom we have Grounds of Charity, that they have experienced a saving Change in this Day, as appeareth by abiding Manifestations of a serious, religious, humble Spirit and the va∣rious

<P>☞Having suffer'd some Injustice, pobably by the <HI>Press,</HI> as well as by Transcribers, with respect to a Letter I wrote soon after the Lord's Work began so powerfully among us, which was publish'd without my Knowledge, the Author thinks proper to advertise, that

<HEAD>A Faithful NARRATIVE, OF The surprizing Work of God's Grace, AT East-Hampton, 1764.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the great Jehovah, for the illustrous Display of his adorable Attributes, is pleas'd to come into his Church, by a plentiful Effusion of his Holy Spirit, by whose powerful In∣fluences, his own Children are eminently quicken'd and comforted; and great Numbers of careless Sinners, are brought to this Soul concerning Question, "what must we do to be saved"? And many in a Judgment of Cha∣rity, "are translated out of Darkness into marvellous Light," such an <HI>Event</HI> is worthy of more than silent Notice, and should be declared abroad, for a <HI>Memorial</HI> of divine Grace and Glory. Many of my Revd. <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Ministry, and some other Friends, have requested the Favour of a more particular
<PB N="2" REF="010250_0019_0F7E256E2F9FC1D8"/>
Account of the Lord's late marvellous Work of Grace among <HI>us,</HI> than as yet they have re∣ceived. Many who are waiting for the Com∣ing and Kingdom of our Lord Christ, I hear from various Parts, wellcome the <HI>News</HI> of this blessed Work, with an Ardour of Gratitude, and with a Transport of Delight. Some past Ac∣counts of this <HI>Work,</HI> have been owned of God: Which gives Ground to hope, that a more particular Account, may have a happy Effect, by the divine Blessing, for the Revival of Re∣ligion in other Places, and the Enlargement of the Kingdom of the Divine Redeemer in the World. There have been some Misrepre∣sentations of this Work, which ought to be corrected. A copious Effusion of the Holy Spirit upon a People, is such an Event, at∣tends to confirm the Divinity of the glorious Gospel of our Lord: And gives Honour to to the Holy Spirit, manifesting the Reality of his Office and influence, in the effectual Appli∣cation of Redemption. It invites the Notice, and be speaks the Praises of the divine Lovers of <HI>Zion'</HI>s Prosperity: And also directly tends to animate their Hopes, Strengthen their Faith, and enliven their Prayers. It moreover appears to be the Lord's reveal'd Will, that such an Event in the divine OEconomy, should be recorded; Not only for the present Benefit
<PB N="3" REF="010250_0020_0F7E256E98A0B3E8"/>
of some; but also for the future Good of others. Thus much, I suppose, those Words which the Holy Spirit (the great Secretary of Heaven) hath left upon Record, plainly hold forth: "When the Lord shall build up Zion, He shall appear in his Glory. He will regard the Prayer of the Destitute, and will not despise their Prayer. This shall be written for the Generation to come: And the People which shall be created shall praise the Lord." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>This shall be known when we are dead,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And left on long Record,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That Ages yet unborn may read,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And trust, and Praise the Lord</HI></L>
<BIBL>Psal. cii. 16:17:18.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> To transmit to Posterity, present marvellous Dispensations of God's Grace, is a Debt due to them: And may be a Means of exciting <HI>them,</HI> to trust in, and praise <HI>Him.</HI> For <HI>these</HI> and other Reasons I have at length consented to the Publication of the following <HI>Narrative.</HI> In doing which, I look upon my self, under the most solemn Obligations to maintain the strictest Regard to Truth.</P>
<P>Perhaps, to a Stranger it may be useful previously to observe a few Things.</P>
<P>Our remote Situation from the Continent,
<PB N="4" REF="010250_0021_0F7E256F51787920"/>
I suppose, hath in a Measure been a Means of Preservation from those Errors in Doctrine; those Amusements by Controversies; and those Corruptions in Morals, by vicious Examples, ordinarily most prevalent, in populous Places. Yet we have been taught, that meer nega∣tive Advantages, united with Gospel Ordinan∣ces, will not give Interest in positive spiritual Blessings without the Concurrence of Divine Influence.</P>
<P>There are about Two-hundred Families belong∣ing to the <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>East Hampton.</HI> The Body of the <HI>Town</HI> is so Compact, that several hun∣dred People, live within Hearing of the Ring∣ing of <HI>Bell,</HI> in a Season tolerably calm and serene. Living thus compactly, hath been of Advantage for the more swift Propogation of a religious Concern in the late Day there are be∣longing to the <HI>Town</HI> two Villages, the one about three Miles <HI>East,</HI> and the other as far <HI>West,</HI> from the Body of the <HI>Town.</HI> I have been in∣formed by the Aged among <HI>us,</HI> that the first Inhabitants of the <HI>Town,</HI> come from both <HI>Eng∣lands:</HI> And that some of them were very pious People.</P>
<P>The Rev. <HI>Thomas James,</HI> was the first settled Minister in the <HI>Town.</HI> He continued in the Ministry <HI>here,</HI> for a considerable Num∣ber of Years. After a Vacancy of some Years, <HI>Sept.</HI> 13th. 1699. the Rev. Mr. <HI>Nathanael
<PB N="5" REF="010250_0022_0F7E2572B3D40930"/>
Hunting</HI> was ordained, and continued in the Ministry <HI>here,</HI> 47 Years. Upon my Instal∣ment, <HI>Sept.</HI> 19th. 1746. He, being now aged and under growing Infirmities, relinquished his Pastoral Relation to this People.</P>
<P>In the Rev. Mr. Hunting's Day, now above twenty Years since, there was a very plentiful Effusion of the Holy Spirit, upon the People of this <HI>Town.</HI> The good Effects of which abide to this Day, and as to Numbers, I trust, will abide for ever. Some who were brought under Soul concern in that Day, have received Light and Comfort, between that <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>this:</HI> And in some Instances the Concern of that <HI>Day,</HI> hath extended down to the present, now hopefully issuing in a saving Change. While I have Cause to be deeply humbled for, and to lament my great Deficiences, and Barreness as to <HI>Ministerial Fruits;</HI> I have Reason to bless the Lord, that I have not altogether "run in Vain, nor labour'd in Vain." From the first of my Ministry <HI>here,</HI> there have been Persons truly awaken'd, and hopefully effectually called, from Time to Time. About 4 or 5 Years after my Instalment, I had what I have ever since called a small Harvest of Souls. There have been several Seasons, in which the Lord hath given us some Revival of his Work. In which my hopes run high, that it would become very general; but the Event was not fully

equal to my raised Expectations. As in a Dry Season, when the Clouds gather and hang over <HI>us,</HI> as though they were about to pour down a Plenty of Waters upon the thirsty <HI>Earth,</HI> Yet they pass Over, and a few Drops only fall. Between the Time of my Instalment, and the late wonderful Day, I received into full Communion about eighty Persons. The greater Part, of <HI>these,</HI> were Such as first hoped they received a saving Change before my Instalment. <HI>Others</HI> were such as hoped, since that Time, they passed from Death to Life.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1764. There appeared some hopeful <HI>Tokens,</HI> that the Lord was preparing his own Way, for a gracious Visitation. The absolute Necessity and Impor∣tance of the Divine Influences, in order to the Revival of Religion, become more frequently the Subject of Serious Conversation among the Godly. Some of the Lord's People become wrestling <HI>Jacobs</HI> for the Divine Influences. Our Assemblies for divine Worship grew larger, and their Attention more engaged: And the Word Preach'd began now, by the divine Blessing, to become powerful to quicken and comfort some of the Lord's People; and to enlighten and awaken some Sinners. Thus the Lord seem'd to be preparing his Way, by gradually granting his returning Presence to
<PB N="7" REF="010250_0024_0F7E25743B7B0D00"/>
his People, until the memorable Sabbath March the 18th. Upon this Day, our Assem∣bly was very large, and more solemly attentive, than ever I knew it before. while the People heard on one Part of the Day, what good <HI>News</HI> was brought them from Heaven, by the Gospel; and on the other, what would be good <HI>News,</HI> to be carried from Earth to Heaven, by attending Angels, they seem'd in general upon the Point of submitting to the prevailing Power of divine Truth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> xxv. 25.</NOTE> Upon this Day <HI>the Spirit of Prayer,</HI> for the Divine Influences, seem'd to be poured forth, as in a Kind of Celestial Torrent. Some awakend Sin∣ners had their Convictions encreased, and some others were influenced to attend more seriously, than ever before, to their eternal Concern∣ments. This <HI>Day</HI> which God hath made to be had in Remembrance, marvelous as it was! I give the Place of a preparatory <HI>Day</HI> to March, 19th. Upon this Day, the Lord be∣gan to carry on his Work with astonishing Power and Glory! "According to this Time it shall be said," (of East-Hampton) what hath God wrought! <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num.</HI> xxiii. 23.</NOTE> "In the after Part of this Day, I discoursed with a young Person in Agony of Distress for Sin, and an Interest in the Saviour. Near the Evening I went to see
<PB N="8" REF="010250_0025_0F7E25749531B478"/>
a young Man, that had concluded for a Time, not to go to Church upon the Afternoon the Day before, fearing he should cry out in Pub∣lick; so as to interrupt the Hearing of others: His Convictions were so Powerful, that it seem'd to him impossible to avoid it. Before I came to the House, I met some young Persons under Concern, on their Way to visit me: Up∣on Invitation, they, and some others, soon came into the House after me. One following the Example of another 'till there were about a hundred Persons assembled: With whom I spent some Hours, in Prayer and Exhortation. The Lord was Pleased at this Time, to bow the Heavens, and come down by an Effusion of the Blessed Spirit, in a most plentiful and surprizing Manner! The House seem'd full of the Presence of God: And almost all pre∣sent appear'd some how awed and influenced thereby. I now heard many Sinners making the most mournful Declarations of their exceed∣ing Sinfulness before God, and of their infinite Danger of eternal Damnation! Some uttered their Cries after the Manner of the <HI>Apostle Peter'</HI>s Hearers, "What shall we do"? The Intreaties of some, were like the poor <HI>Publican,</HI> "God be merciful to me a Sinner"! Oh! "who among us shall dwell with devouring Fire? Who among us, shall dwell with ever∣lasting Burnings"? "If I go to <HI>Hell,</HI> I don't
<PB N="9" REF="010250_0026_0F7E2575555C0480"/>
want Company: If I must go, let me go a∣lone, to those immortal Torments"! The Wrath of God now appeared to sit heavy upon the guilty Consciences of Sinners, and his in∣finite Displeasure against Sin, seem'd to fill their Souls with unutterable Anguish and Tor∣ment, as tho' their eternal Damnation was already begun. 'Tis supposed that 30 or 40 Persons went Home from this Meeting under most powerful Conviction of Sin and Misery, and anxious to the last Degree, to know what they should do to be saved. When they came to the respective Houses of their Abode, they entered them with Declarations that they were guilty Sinners going to <HI>Hell.</HI> Their Agonies of Distress and moving Expressions had a good Effect upon the Families, to which they be∣belonged. This Evening and next Morning, the Tidings of this wonderful Meeting, spread swiftly through the <HI>Town,</HI> and gave a Shock like seven fold Thunder. The very Report thereof, awakened Sinners to Soul-Concern, as it flew: And excited in the Lord's People, so∣lemn Joy, lively Hope, fervent Prayer, holy Ad∣miration, and devout Praise Early the next Mor∣ning, after this wonderful Meeting, my House was thronged with distressed <HI>Law</HI> condemned, <HI>Gospel-</HI>condemned, <HI>Conscience-</HI>condemned Sin∣ners. Indeed, our Houses all over <HI>Town,</HI> now began to have Persons in them of this Character.
<PB N="10" REF="010250_0027_0F7E25767A4D3390"/>
I had now Opportunity for particular Converse with many of the awakened, and Occasion to observe, that altho' their Convictions were so ve∣ry powerful, yet they were rational and Scriptu∣ral, and as far as I could judge, evidently the Effect of a Sight of Truth, by the Holy Spirit's Illumination and Operation as a <HI>Con∣vincer.</HI> At the Close of the Meeting the last Evening, I notified a Lecture to be attended at 2 o'Clock in the House of God to Day. The Report of the wonderful Effects of the Meet∣ing last Evening, and of Lecture to Day, was soon propogated in all Parts of the <HI>Town:</HI> So that People from the Villages and remote Parts of Town met for divine Worship in the House of God, even an Hour before the appointed Time, <HI>being swift to hear.</HI> They all appeared serious, when I met them in God's House, as tho' they were looking into the eternal World. While I preached to them, every Eye that was not overwhelm'd in Tears, appear'd fix'd upon the Speaker, and every Ear chained to the Things spoken. Solemn profound Reverence appeared in every Countenance, and they heard as Crea∣tures made for Eternity, and bound over to a Judgment to come. After Sermon I pro∣nounced the Blessing as usual; but the People all kept their Places, appearing unwilling to leave the House of God. Where upon, I pray'd again, and gave a Word of Exhortation:
<PB N="11" REF="010250_0028_0F7E2576E939A278"/>
And suddenly there was a most marvelous Ef∣fusion of the Holy Spirit, upon People in all Parts of the Church. People in general con∣tinued in the House of God 'till 9 o'Clock in the Evening. Many Sinners were brought un∣der powerful Convictions; others had their Concern increased; some who had been under Concern before, met with Light and Comfort; many of the Lord's People appeared to have amazing Manifestations of divine Glory, and answerable Fullness of divine Joy.</P>
<P>The Day following my House was early thronged by great Number, of weary heavy laden Sinners. Soon after the Middle of the Day, People in great Numbers were going up to the <HI>Temple,</HI> as supposing Publick-Worship, would probably be attended as upon the Day before, altho' there was no previous Appoint∣ment of a <HI>Lecture.</HI> About 2 o'Clock we all met in solemn Assembly, and Divine Service was attended as on the preceeding Day. After prononucing the Blessing People abode in their Seats as upon the Day before. I then continued to pray and exhort them for about an Hour. There was much Solemnity and Seriousness upon the Face of the Assembly; yet the People seemed to be waiting for an increasing Sense of divine Things, by more plentiful Measures of divine Influence. Where upon I took Occasion to observe, that we were entirely
<PB N="12" REF="010250_0029_0F7E257A81E006B8"/>
dependent upon a sovereign GOD, for such Effusions of the Holy Spirit, as were granted the Day before: That God was now teach∣ing of us thus much: That we must look beyond Means, and have our Expectations upon God only. I repeatedly charged the People in the most solemn Manner, and be∣seeched them again and again, to give God the Glory, <HI>all</HI> the Glory, if He should now condescend to grant a marvelous Out-pouring of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Immediately thereupon as I proceeded to Speak, there appeared to be a most surprizing Effusion of the Holy Spirit, upon People in all Parts of the House. An Al∣mighty Energy seem'd to accompany the same Words, so as that they became powerful to a Multitude in one and the same solemn Mo∣ment of Time. The Effects of this Out∣pouring of the Spirit seem'd to be exactly parrallel to that upon the preceeding Day. This Dispensation was so timed, and so marvelous in various Respects, that a Person of liberal <HI>Edu∣cation,</HI> and judicious Observation, occasionally present at this Time, hath since observed to me, that this Event was so wonderful and observable in it's Circumstances and Effects that had an <HI>Atheist</HI> been present and heard and observed all that was said, and beheld what fol∣low'd, he must necessarily have acknowledged the Existence of a God, and the Reality of <HI>Divine Influence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010250_0030_0F7E257B26B48DD8"/>
The Following Day (Thursday March 22) was a Day appointed upon the preceeding <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> to be observed as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, for the out Pouring of the Holy Spirit; upon <HI>us</HI> in particular, and the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ in general. The Report of what God was doing among <HI>us,</HI> had now spread abroad, and many People from neighbouring Congregations came to join with us in the solemn Services of this Day. So that we had now the largest As∣sembly I ever saw upon this End of our <HI>Isle.</HI> There was such universal Solemnity and pro∣found Attention upon the Face of the Assembly as exceeded all I ever saw before. It was such a <HI>Fast Day,</HI> for a powerful Sense of the infi∣nite Evil of Sin, and Lamentation therefore for a Spirit of Prayer, and for solemn Joy and <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> with great Numbers, as exceeded all of this Kind, I had before known. To∣ward the Close of this Day, there were plen∣tiful Measures of divine Influence given, like as upon foregoing Days. The Lord now seem'd to be verifying his Promise, "And it shall come to pass, before they call, I will an∣swer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxv. 24. <HI>This Tent, my Rev. Brother Mr.</HI> James Brown, <HI>improved, in the after Part of this memorable Day, as now exemplified.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010250_0031_0F7E257B58032010"/>
People assembled for Publick Worship upon <HI>Friday</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> as before upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Wednesday;</HI> altho' no Lecture was pre∣viously appointed: And Upon each of these Days, there were wonderful Effusions of the Holy Spirit After this Week, Lectures were ordinarily given out upon the <HI>Sabath,</HI> except upon the unexpected coming of a Minister from a Distance. I suppose our attending publick Worship so often this Week, occasioned some Reports abroad, that People here had wholly thrown by all Wordly Business, and betook themselves intirely to religious Exercises. 'Tis true indeed, that People looked upon the World, as it really is, in Point of Sufficiency, an empty <HI>Thing;</HI> and in some good Measure, esteemed the Favour of God, as it will be looked upon at the Day of eternal Judgment, even as the everlasting <HI>ALL!</HI> An extraordinary Day, will doubtless justify that Conduct, that would not be prudent, at other Seasons I Suppose St. <HI>Paul</HI> did not continue his Sermon 'till mid-night every Evening He preached, Yet he thought proper to do it upon a particular Occasion. My dear People, now addressed each other in the Lan∣guage of the <HI>Prophet,</HI> "Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the House of the God of <HI>Jacob."</HI> &amp;c. They were glad to meet me daily in God's House, and I was equally rejoiced to meet them <HI>there.</HI> I heartily
<PB N="15" REF="010250_0032_0F7E257C1522EF38"/>
wish every Minister of the Gospel, in <HI>City, Town,</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> like Occasion of meeting there People in the Lord's House! For I am perswaded that I, and many of my dear People, will have <HI>those Days,</HI> in joyful and everlasting Remem∣brance.</P>
<P>Upon the fore mentioned solemn Days, when the Holy Ghost thus descended, in the Appli∣cation of Himself to his Work, He appeared to give his powerful Presence and Illumination to great Numbers at the same Time: Whereby they had amazingly increased upon them, Views of divine Things, seeing Truth and the awful and glorious Realities of the eternal World, in a clear, Strong, affecting and practical Light. From Day to Day, I now saw many Sinners of various Ages, upon their Knees, with Hands extended toward Heaven, and in flowing Tears, begging and crying for the Exercise of sovereign Mercy in the Name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> with as much Earnestness and Importunity, to all Appearance, as tho' the Lord Jesus Christ was then coming in flaming Fire to the final Judgment. They seem'd to be pressing into the Kingdom of God, as if they would take it by Violence. I saw many <HI>others</HI> under powerful Convictions; Yet not in such great Distress. Many appear'd under the Abatement of <HI>Legal</HI> Terrors, as in a most calm and serene Frame of Mind, as tho' resigning up their Souls to a sovereign God
<PB N="16" REF="010250_0033_0F7E257D1290AB98"/>
thro' the glorious Mediator, in Hope of eter∣nal Life by his Mediation. I saw very many just begining to hope they were favour'd with some divine Manifestations and seem'd wholly to be taken up and captivated with the perfect Excellence and Glory, the alluring Fullness and Sufficiency of the Lord Christ: Declaring his entire Suitableness and infinite Worthiness of the Choice, Trust, Love and Praise of <HI>All.</HI> Admiring the adorable Riches of his free and sovereign Grace made known to such infinitely Vale, unworthy Sinners as they were: And uttering the Praises of the all-glorious, all-together Lovely Lord Jesus, as tho' their whole Souls glow'd with a <HI>Seraphic</HI> Love to him. The House of God at these Seasons seem'd to be full of his awful and glorious Presence! And I used to visit the distressed in all Parts of it, and to converse with and to drop a Word of Exhortation to great Numbers in a short Space of Time, and the Lord gave the Blessing.</P>
<P>From Day to Day, we now saw both in the House of God, and in our own Houses surprizing Displays of the divine Power, Love and Grace of our IMMANUAL. The aw∣ful and indearing Glories of the GODHEAD shined forth in <HI>this Work,</HI> as sufficient to fill Heaven and Earth, Angels and Saints, with an Extacy of Joy! With inexpressible Won∣der,
<PB N="17" REF="010250_0034_0F7E257D90D2AFB8"/>
we beheld the Magnificent Triumphs of the victorious Arms of Z<HI>ion's</HI> King, over the united Powers of Darkness, while stout hearted Sinners bowed to the Sceptre of his Grace, and became his willing People in the Day of his all-conquering Power! The Lord's People in general, seem'd to be under the animating Power of Religion: And mighty in Prayer for divine Influences, and the Salvation of precious Souls. Some of them especially appeared like primitive <HI>Christans</HI> full of the Holy Ghost, rejoicing in the Lord. While the Comforts of <HI>Some,</HI> and the Distress of <HI>Others,</HI> ran so high and became so great, as set in <HI>Contrast</HI> and stand∣ing opposed, we had, as it were, a Sort of Re∣semblance of the Day of final Judgement, and it appeared as if Persons were now entering upon their eternal States of Heaven and Hell. 'Tis indeed beyond me to give a full Description of this wonderful <HI>Scene.</HI> No Person can form an adequate <HI>Idea</HI> of such a marvellous Dispen∣sation of divine Power and Grace, but as being a Spectator, and sharing largely in the divine Influences.</P>
<P>If any should ask why the Lord carried on his Work <HI>in such a visible Way?</HI> Why was it attended with such unusual Symptoms? What valuable Ends could be answer'd there∣by? I would reply, I have not directed the Spirit of the Lord, nor have I been his Coun∣seller
<PB N="18" REF="010250_0035_0F7E25814E3E6878"/>
Who can search out the Almighty to Perfection? However, some obvious and probable Reasons may be assigned: These extraordinary Appearences, have answered many valuable Purposes.</P>
<P>With Respect to true Believers in Christ, their high and strong Exercises of all E∣vangical Graces, by which they Glorify God. have been in full Proportion to those extraor∣dinary Measures of the divine Influences. Their anxieties for the Formation of the Im∣age of Christ in the perishing Souls of Sin∣ners, and their fervent incessant Prayers, and Activity, for that important Purpose, have been in full Proportion to the copious Mea∣sures of divine Influence enjoy'd: And thereby they have answerably seen the Glory of the Lord's Work and have been disposed and enabled to rejoice therein, and to give Him the entire Glory thereof: Vehemently pant∣ing and ardently aspiring after absolute Per∣fection and a glorious Immortality, at the same Time. While the Lord's People have drank so largely of the New Wine of everlasting Consolation, filled like the Vessels of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> as the <HI>Prophet Zacheriah</HI> hath fore∣told, they have been "as the Stones of a Crown lifted up, as an Ensign upon the Land:" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> ix. 15, 16.</NOTE> And and as the <HI>Prophet Isaiah,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="010250_0036_0F7E258156849E30"/>
"a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the Hand of our God." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isai.</HI> lxii.</NOTE> The Brightness and Lustre of their Example and Excellence of their Attainments in Holiness and Joy, set up to the View of others, have been as an Ensign to gather about, as a Prize to run for, and as a Crown and Glory to strive to obtain: And thereby Saints of less Experience have been excited to ardent Desires after such excellent Attainments; some meer <HI>nominal Christians</HI> have been convinced they had no Grace; and many poor distressed disconsolate Sinners, have been ready to say, "thy People shall be my People, and thy God, my God."</P>
<P>With Reference to Sinners, while the Lord hath carried on his Work in this <HI>Way,</HI> as by such powerful Illumination and pungent Con∣viction, ordinarily the Work of Humiliation hath made the swifter Progress. Many of them, seem'd to see and learn more of their exceeding Sinfulness, spiritual Impotency, un∣worthyness of God's Mercy, and his Justice in their eternal Damnation, in one Day, than some others, who have been under Conviction at other Seasons, have done in Weeks or Months. The observable Distress and Soul Agony of <HI>some,</HI> by the Blessing of God, hath
<PB N="20" REF="010250_0037_0F7E25821463C9A0"/>
been the Means both of awakening, and in∣creasing the Concern of many <HI>others.</HI> While Sinners have been Spectators of their Fellow Sinners under such Soul-agony of Distress, they have been ready to say, and have said, <HI>"there, there,</HI> is one and another, yea many going to be taken, and I am like to be left! <HI>These</HI> in such Distress about their Sins and Salvation, are not greater Sinners than <HI>I am.</HI> They see their Sin and Danger, and are affected; but I am dreadfully harden'd, amazingly stupid, I shall be left! Oh! What shall I do to be concerned for my Soul." It hath been natural for Sinners, who have beheld others so greatly concern'd to argue thus, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "if the infinite Displeasure of God against Sin, is so terrible in its Effects now, if one Spark of his Wrath produceth such Agony of Soul now, as if Hell Torments were begun, oh, how dreadful an Evil is <HI>Sin?</HI> What, oh! What will it be to have full Vials pour'd out upon the guilty damned! How insurportable, how intolerable, to go down to Hell, where the Billows of the Wrath of Almighty God, rowl over the dam∣ned for one compleat <HI>Eternity!</HI> oh, of what infinite Importance is it, that I flee from <HI>the Wrath to come"!</HI> When any have met with Light and Comfort, who had been the subjects of such great Distress of Soul, this hath eminently been the Means of promoting the Lord's Work
<PB N="21" REF="010250_0038_0F7E2582D280C160"/>
among <HI>us.</HI> It hath given a mighty Shock to others, least they should be left, as <HI>Marishes and Miry Places,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> xlvii. II.</NOTE> without Life and Healing, by the flowing Waters of the Sanctuary. I have known in many Instances a Work of Humi∣liation, powerfully carried on, while the Sub∣jects thereof have scarcely thought themselves under such a Work, and this in Part owing to the greater apparent Concern of others. The visi∣ble and great Distress of Sinners, hath excited answerable Compassion in the Lord's People for them, and more effectually engaged their Prayers. I may add, that while the Lord hath thus carried on his Work, he hath given a Specimen of the Terrors of that Day, when He will come <HI>in flaming Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover the Report of these <HI>Doings</HI> and mighty <HI>Acts</HI> of the wonder working JE∣HOVAH hath awakened and engaged the At∣tention of Multitudes in other Places. The Accounts I have received, will justify me in asserting that I have Reason to believe, thou∣sands have been brought to think more seriously about the Salvation of their Souls, and Things eternal, by Means of these marvellous Dispen∣sations of God. Many Godly Ministers, and pious People, have been excited thereby to give Glory to God, and encouraged to pray more
<PB N="22" REF="010250_0039_0F7E2583C8D7AC00"/>
earnestly for such Effusions of the Blessed Spi∣rit. It seems as tho' God was pleased thus to carry on his Work, that it might be taken the more Notice of in the World, and that it might be regarded and spoken of, that so He might have the more Glory. The Report of these extraordinary Operations, hath induced many to come among <HI>us,</HI> some of which, have hopefully thereby pertaken of the Dews of the heavenly Influence, and given Glory to God. <HI>These,</HI> and such like, I humbly suppose, are some of the obvious Reasons, and Pur∣poses answered, with Reference to the Lord's carrying on his Work, in such a powerful, visi∣ble and glorious Manner: While many more may lie hid in the unfathomable Abys of divine Counsels: For, how little a Portion is heard of Him! This Knowledge is too won∣derful for us!</P>
<P>If any of my Readers judge I have dwelt too long upon the Effusion of the Holy Spirit upon this Week, by Way of Apology, I would observe. That the precious Influences of the divine Spirit are worthy of incomparably more Notice than I have taken of them. That by these Dispensations, the Lord prepared the Way for many future SALVATIONS. I have also dwelt the longer upon these marvellous Effusions of the Holy Ghost, because I hope the <HI>Days</HI> are not very far off, when such Out∣pouring
<PB N="23" REF="010250_0040_0F7E2584A1D33DA0"/>
of the <HI>Spirit</HI> will become more fre∣quent and general among the Lord's People: And in Process of Tune the World over. The present <HI>Narration</HI> of such surprising Effusions of the Holy Spirit, together with the good Effects, (if read by any) may serve for Con∣firmation of the Reality of the Lord's Work in <HI>such Days.</HI> No doubt, the Days are com∣ing when an immence Plenty of the Lord's spiritual Waters, will be pour'd out upon thirsty Souls, and even Floods upon the dry Ground: And it will seem as if the very Heavens were rent asunder, and as it were dropt down from above, as at once. The com∣ing of our Lord Christ in his Kingdom, among Men, will be in a sudden, amazing and irresistible Manner, and with clear Manifesta∣tion, like Lightening that can't be hid, but glares in every ones Eyes, and shines from one Side of Heaven to the other. When at Even∣ing Time it shall be Light, and so perpetual Day with <HI>Zion:</HI> For then Jehovah will be unto her an everlasting Light, and her God her Glory. To mention such a Day as not very far off, I am quite apprehensive, will be thought by <HI>some,</HI> the same as to <HI>Prophesy.</HI> I am no Prophet, neither am I a <HI>Prophet'</HI>s Son; but I profess to believe the <HI>Prophecies.</HI> Altho' it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not be for us to know the precise Time, and exact Periods, when the <HI>Pope</HI> in the <HI>West,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="010250_0041_0F7E25851AA47710"/>
and <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the <HI>East,</HI> with their Powers will be utterly ruined, "so as no Place shall be found for them;" yet it may, (I humbly conceive) be made evident from the Prophecies themselves, and divine Dispensations, that the Lord's People have now Ground to hope for some signal and plentiful Effusions of the Holy Spirit. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>With all Humility and Modesty, I would take the Liberty to suppose, that the western</HI> Empire <HI>Christian, and</HI> Antichristian, <HI>is the one Leg and foot of the grand</HI> Image: <HI>And the eastern</HI> Empire, Christian, <HI>and</HI> Mehometan, <HI>is the other Leg and Foot of the Image; accord∣ing to the</HI> Prophet Daniel's <HI>Discription of the fourth</HI> Monarchy. <HI>Therefore the papistical</HI> an∣tichristian Power <HI>in the</HI> West, <HI>and the</HI> Meho-metan antichristian <HI>Power in the</HI> East, <HI>will be smitten, by the</HI> Stone cut out of the Mountain, in order to it's filling the whole Earth. <HI>From thence, may it not be inferred, that as the 5th Vial is pouring out upon the antichristian</HI> Power <HI>in the</HI> West; <HI>the 6th.</HI> Vial <HI>will more especially be poured out upon the</HI> Mehomitan antichristian Power <HI>in the East: Which</HI> Power, <HI>will not fall gradually, like that in the</HI> West; <HI>but suddenly: "In one Day her Plagues shall come upon her," as a Mill-Stone thrown with Violence</HI> into the Sea, <HI>sinks and never rises more.

to bring on the Millenium or latter Day∣Glory in its full Meridian, Splender and Bright∣ness: But then if we view the fulfilment of almost every Thing the Prophecies speak pre∣ceeding, we shall find Grounds to expect not only a Prelude to, but even the very Dawnings of that glorious long expected, long wished for, and long pray'd for <HI>Day.</HI> If I have gain∣ed any Knowledge of this Kind, by a diligent Study of the <HI>Prophecies,</HI> for many Years past, I freely profess I am in daily Expectation of approaching terrible Things in Righteousness; amazing Changes hastening on the Earth; mar∣vellous Out-pourings of the Holy Spirit; and following Glories. But I must not digress too far, upon the agreeable Subject.</P>
<P>After the forementioned ever memorable <HI>Week,</HI> there were no more such sudden astonish∣ing Effusions of the Holy Spirit, (like a mighty rushing Wind) except for 2 or 3 Days a few Weeks afterwards. However there were such plentiful Measures of divine Influence continually granted, and such eminent Degrees of God's gracious Presence accompanying
<PB N="26" REF="010250_0043_0F7E2588F8A88058"/>
divine Institutions, as that his Work made glorious Progress. All Parts of the <HI>Town</HI> seemed to be full of God's Presence, and the Power of his victorious Grace. Souls were now, to all Appearance, flocking in Numbers to the Lord Jesus Christ from Day to Day. Soon after the Work begun among us with such great Power, very many in a Day, day after Day, hoped they received divine Light and Comfort. and for several Months, (as I remember) not a Week past, but there were some that hoped (and still hope, with others) that they were translated out of Darkness into marvellous Light. But the time would fail to mention the apparent universal Concern of People, about the great things of the eternal World: And the spiritual Exercises of parti∣cular Persons: The Tokens we enjoy'd of God's Presence, and how his glorious Work made Progress from Week to Week: To do these things in their Order and Series would require a Volume in <HI>Folio,</HI> in stead of a short <HI>Narritive.</HI></P>
<P>I shall therefore proceed to give some Ac∣count of the <HI>Manner</HI> in which Persons have been wrought upon, with Respect to the Work of Conviction and Humiliation. And of divine Manifestations thereupon. And of the Subse∣quent Effects Exercises and Fruits. Which the Subjects of this <HI>Work,</HI> profess to be ex∣perimentally

acquainted with: As I am well assured, by the Accounts they have given me, and from what appears in Life and Con∣versation. As to their Spiritual Exercises and Experiences, I have Occasion to observe, that in some Respects their is great and wonder∣full <HI>Variety,</HI> in other <HI>Respects,</HI> (especially as to essential Points) great and Surprising <HI>Harmony.</HI></P>
<P>The Subjects of this <HI>Work,</HI> profess to have had clear and powerful Conviction of the total Pollution of their Natures, and actual Defilements of their Lives. <HI>Some</HI> when a∣wakened were first of all convinced of actual Sin, and thereby were led by the Streams back to the Fountain of Iniquity: <HI>Others,</HI> were suddenly seized with Conviction of the exceeding Sinfulness of their Hearts, and thereby were brought to the Knowledge of their Wickedness of Life. Some had gradual Conviction, 'till their Concern became very great, and distressing: Others, were soon taken hold of and seized with powerful Convictions, when first awakened. Their Attention to the important Concernments of their Souls appears to be brought on and increased upon them, by a View of themselves in their true and proper <HI>Character,</HI> as given in the Word of God. They see the <HI>spirituallity</HI> and Strictness of the <HI>Law</HI> of God: Thereby they have
<PB N="28" REF="010250_0045_0F7E258A5B465C60"/>
the Knowledge of their exceeding Sinfulness before Him. When by the <HI>Law,</HI> applyed with Power, by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> they see their Sin, Guilt, and Danger of Damnation, this View gives them the utmost Solicitude to know what they shall do to be saved. When they are first awakened they don't see their absolute Inability to help themselves, 'till by Tryal they find their Strength, Weakness. Their Awaken∣ings put them upon Confession, of Sinfulness both of Heart and Life; upon Cries for sove∣reign Mercy, as tho' they would pierce the Heavens; upon greatness of Endeavours after Salvation, as if they would take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence. When they are first awakened, commonly for a Time, they think they find in themselves a Willingness to come to Christ for Salvation; but as a Work of Conviction is carried on, they see they have imposed upon themselves, by taking an Un∣willingness to be forever miserable, to be a real Willingness to come to Christ. I have known the poor Sinner upon more thorough Acquain∣tance with his Heart, under distressing Con∣viction of the great Evil of ever supposing he had such a <HI>Willingness,</HI> being now made to see, that all this Time he was virtually casting the Fault upon Christ that he had not an In∣terest in <HI>Him,</HI> whereas all the Fault, was justly chargeable upon the Sinner himself. The Spi∣rit
<PB N="29" REF="010250_0046_0F7E258B1DE42920"/>
of God in his <HI>legal</HI> Strivings with Sinners in this <HI>Day,</HI> hath powerfully convinced and taught them, that there is a <HI>Cannot</HI> and <HI>Will∣not,</HI> justly chargeable upon them. They see their <HI>Inability</HI> to believe, is an Unwillingness, a vile and wicked Temper of Heart. That the Cause of their not coming to Christ for Salvation, is not so much a <HI>can-not,</HI> altho' they <HI>can-not</HI> as a <HI>Will∣not,</HI> a blameable Opposition of Heart to the crown∣ing of Christ with the Honour and Glory of their eternal Salvation. Now they see themselves justly condemned both by <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel.</HI> They sadly complain of the Enmity and Pride of their Hearts, of the Stubborness and Obsti∣nacy of their Wills, of the gross Blindness of their Minds: That they can't see their own Bad∣ness; nor the Justice of God in their eternal Condemnation as they think others do, before they come to Christ. Sometimes they think they are wholly stupid and senseless, that the Spirit of God has done striving with them, and that they are given up to Hardness of Heart and Blindness of Mind, which Thought great∣ly exercises their Fear. They often think their Case somewhat singular, that their Convictions don't Work well, that they are not such as the <HI>Elect</HI> have before Conversion. When they are brought to see their own infinite Vileness, they greatly admire the Patience of God, That He has kept them out of Hell, and wonder he don't
<PB N="30" REF="010250_0047_0F7E258BDA6D59B0"/>
send them immediately to everlasting Burnings, and own it would be infinitely just if He should. They strive and labour to get an Alteration of Heart for the better; but com∣plain of growing worse all the while. They think they had as good leave off striving for Salvation, as to any Power of their own to obtain; and yet eternal Salvation appears of such Importance that they persevere in striving. 'Tis very common to have <HI>Scripture</HI> Truths, which they hear or read powerfully applied to their Hearts for increasing their Convictions. As the Holy Spirit continues his Illumination, and a Work of the <HI>Law</HI> is carried on, they see their exceeding Sinfulness, and are brought to confess that God hath made no Promises of Mercy to them, that after all their persevering Endeavours for Salvation, He may justly reject them forever. Being thus at Length, clearly and powerfully convinced of the Strictness of God's Law, of their exceeding Sinfulness, of their total Impotency, of the absolute Impos∣sibility of being justified by any manner of Virtue, Goodness or Righteousness of their own, and that it would be infinitely just with God eternally to cast of and destroy <HI>them,</HI> they now see no Hope of Salvation remaining, but by an absolute submiting themselves to God as an Infinite Sovereign. Thus the Way hath been prepared for giving the new <HI>Heart,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="010250_0048_0F7E258C9A2B43B8"/>
and for the Manifestation of divine Glory.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to observe, that Persons under the Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> previous to Sub∣mission Light and Comfort, do not all see these <HI>Truths</HI> in an equally clear Degree of Light; tho' all appear to have a powerful Sense of the reality of them. The Distress of some when first awaken'd, is even to an Agony: Which sometimes continues for an Hour or two and then seems to abate in a Measure; but powerful Convictions still continue. Some have several such Turns of great Distress and Soul Agony, before Light and Comfort. Some never have a Return thereof after their first Awakenings, and the Work of Humiliation is carried on powerfully 'till they meet with Comfort. Many have but little, and some no Sleep the Night before divine Manifestations: Spending the Night in Soul-Agonies and Cries for sovereign Mercy. Many were more gradu∣ally awakened, and seemed to have increasing Convictions of Truth, and prevailing Soul∣Concern 'till they obtain Satisfaction of a Change. There hath been great Variety as to the Length of Time, that Persons have been kept under a Work of the <HI>Law.</HI> Ordinarily the more Powerful Conviction, the sooner Persons have met with Comfort; but it has not always been so. God in that Respect, as well as others, hath eminently displayed
<PB N="32" REF="010250_0049_0F7E258DA1DD3850"/>
adorable Sovereignity. Many Persons that I have coversed with in this <HI>Day,</HI> who appear'd to me to have had a clear Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> yet have been continually seeking Preparation for Christ, by legal Terrors and Humiliations: When they have been told they were making a Righteousness thereof, to recommend them to Christ, and that they must come to Christ upon the Call and Warrant of the Gospel, re∣nouncing all Preparation, self Dependence, and even <HI>non-Dependence,</HI> being thus driven out of their false <HI>Refuges</HI> and Subterfuges they have had not a Moments Rest, 'till brought to a Dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ, for Righteousness, Grace and eternal Life: 'Tis Observable that Persons under a Work of Humiliation often don't think themselves the Subjects thereof: "The blind are led in a Way they know not." I have frequently known, as appear'd to me, Persons the Sub∣jects of real Submission to God, while as yet, they knew not what to make of such a Frame of Mind, as they then found. When the Sinner hath retired again and again, and repeatedly made the Attempt to pray, at least as the poor <HI>Publican,</HI> "God be merciful to me; Sinner," Yet a Sense and clear Conviction of the Justice of God in his eternal Damnation has entirely stopped his Mouth, tho' frequently making the Attempt to utter such a Request
<PB N="33" REF="010250_0050_0F7E259171287518"/>
Ordinarily Sinners have the clearest Views of their own infinite Vileness, of God's Justice and sovereignity, just preceeding Submission and Comfort. Oftimes there is a Sort of Ap∣probation of, and Well-pleasedness with, God's Justice and Sovereignty, and a calm Frame of Spirit, and to them a strange Composure of Mind a little before divine Manifestations. This Calmness of Spirit sometimes continues but for a few Minutes, sometimes for a quarter of an Hour, and sometimes for Hours, before 'tis follow'd with any satisfying Views of an In∣terest in Christ, and the Favour of God. When the Terrors of <HI>Wind, Earth-quake</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> have been useful to prepare the Way, to usher in the design'd Manifestations of the divine Glory, the Lord gives a divine Calm∣ness of Spirit, and comes as in a still small Voice. I may here observe, as a summary Ac∣count, that a <HI>Law-Work,</HI> hath been <HI>substantially</HI> the same in all the different Subjects of it, tho' some passed through much greater Degrees of Distress and Terror than others, and this Dis∣tress lasted much longer with some than others.</P>
<P>The professed Subjects of this Work, give an Ac∣count of some divine Manifestations in the Time of acting Faith and receiving Comfort there upon. They see the Gospel of our Lord IMMANUEL to be divinely true, and prosess to have a Spiritual Sight and divine Illumination 
<PB N="34" REF="010250_0051_0F7E2591E7B757D8"/>
of Mind, in the Knowledge of the glorious Objects of Faith, in Order to believing with the Heart unto Salvation. They appear to be clearly taught, as by Experience, that <HI>they,</HI> and <HI>they</HI> only, who see the <HI>Son</HI> believe in Him: And that the Lord shines into the Heart, when his Glory is beheld in the Face of Christ: And that 'tis a Time of Almighty Power, when the Soul bows to the Sceptre of the Lord Christ and Crowns Him with the Honour of eternal Salvation. I know not the Person in this Day, that makes any Pretence to a Hope that he is savingly wrought upon, that gives not some Account of divine Manifestations, as by a special spiritual Illumi∣nation of Mind. In the Time they suppose they first acted Faith, so as to have Comfort, more generally they profess, to have had a Manifestation, either of God's sovereign Mercy and Grace or of his glorius Attributes as they appear in the Person and Mediation of Jesus Christ; or a View of the Divine and Media∣torial Glory of our Lord IMMANUEL; and his alluring Fullness and All-sufficiency; or of his intire Suitableness; or of the infinite Freeness of his Grace, and his perfect Wil∣lingness to save Sinners; or they behold the infinite Excellence and eternal Safety of the Way of Salvation by Him. When they thus come to know the Lord Christ, they see
<PB N="35" REF="010250_0052_0F7E2592B20F5A78"/>
Him to be Worthy of their Election, Trust, Love and Praise, for what he is in Himself, and appear perfectly well pleased with the Way of Salvation by Him: And these Views are followed with Rest, Peace and Joy divine. By the Calls and Invitations of the Gospel, they appear to be led to the Acceptation of Him: And oftimes their first Comfort is in and by the Letter of the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> but not always.</P>
<P>There is great Variety as to Measures and Degrees of Light and comfort, when Persons first have divine Manifestations. Some have at first only some small Glimpse, of the Fulness and Glory of divine Objects; and these often soon overclouded with Darkness: 'Till at Length divine Manifestations become more clear, full and Satisfactory. Then they per∣ceive they had something of the same Kind before; but in a lower Degree. Some have a more sensible Deliverance from a Spirit of Bondage, divine Light more suddenly and abundantly beams in upon them, and they at once perceive themselves in a new World of Light and Comfort. I can't say that Per∣sons who have had the most Terror and Distress under a Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> have always had the fullest Measures of subsequent Light and Comfort; Yet I think in general it hath been so. Oftimes I have observed,
<PB N="36" REF="010250_0053_0F7E259364433018"/>
that the Oil of Joy for Mourning, and the Garments of Praise for a Spirit of Heaviness, have been in full Proportion to antecedent Distress: There is great variety in these Respects.</P>
<P>When they first behold the Glory of divine Objects, they seem to be intirely taken up in Acts of Choice, Faith, Love, Admiration and Praise: And in ardent Desires after more clear Manifestations and fuller Measures of Enjoyment. Often at this Season, Persons think little or nothing about Conversion, being wholly captivated with the infinite Beauty and Glory of divine Objects: And Ordinarily their Views of their own Vileness, are nor so clear at this Time, as under divine Manifestations afterwards. Now they see that those, and those only, who are drawn by the <HI>Father</HI> come to the <HI>Son:</HI> And that they could not, and would not come before, and that now they can't but come. They now see there is a Consistency between the Freedom of the Will and efficacious Grace in Acts of Faith. Now they see the Grace of God to be infinitely free and sovereign: And long to have others come and see, taste and know, that the Lord is gracious, and to have every Body join with them in his Praise. Now they become assured that the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> are the Word of God: And have oftimes many Gospel
<PB N="37" REF="010250_0054_0F7E259411FCF718"/>
Promises flowing in upon their Minds, one after another, with Light and Comfort: And it seems to them these Promises will always appear as they now do, 'till Time affords Conviction to the reverse. Their Joy and Comfort don't seem to result from Thoughts that they are in a State of Safety, and are like to escape Hell; but appears to be Joy and Rejoicing in the Lord. It begets a low thought of worldly Joys, proves the Death of Joy in Sin, is as Oil to the Wheels, to make them move on swiftly, in the Path-way of Duty, and is a very solemn Joy, often expressed with a flow of Tears. They declare they never knew what Joy and Pleasure were before, nor any Thing worthy of the Name. They loath and abhor themselves for all their past Abominations, and have a different Kind, of Sorrow for Sin, from what they had under a Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> mourning for it now as against an infinitely holy and gracious God. They admire that when the Lord came by his Spirit to awaken them, He did not come Sword in Hand to destroy them. They are great Admirers of free and sovereign Grace, and ascribe the sole Glory and Praise of their Salvation to God the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> There is an endless Variety of divine Truths, which Persons have their Minds fix'd upon and are delighted with. Words seem to fail, as to expressing
<PB N="38" REF="010250_0055_0F7E2594D8DBC8E8"/>
their <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Views</HI> of the infinite Glory of divine Objects, and the everlasting Importance of Things eternal. And while they behold them in such a clear and strong Light, it of∣ten appears to them, as tho' <HI>others</HI> must, as it were, be powerfully impress'd and affected with them. Many see the Justice of God in their eternal Damnation, and other Truths that they had some Sight of under Convictions, in a more clear Point of View, after they have Light and Comfort, than they did before. At the same Time, many express themselves a∣bout the Things of Religion, in many Respects, as if they were new to them, as tho' they never read, nor heard, nor sung before; yet as to the Matter thereof were before acquainted with the same. That Sense they have of the Weight and Importance of divine and eternal Things, influences them to exercise a Jealousy over themselves, least they should sadly im∣pose upon themselves with a false Hope. 'Tis common for Persons after their first Light and Comfort to be again plunged in Darkness and Distress, and to conclude their Comfort was false and unscriptural. They are wont then to seek legal Terrors again, and sometimes ap∣pear in as much Distress as before; yet it seems in some Sort of another Kind, in that they appear secretly to mourn the Want of an absent Good, before enjoyed. After these
<PB N="39" REF="010250_0056_0F7E2595D97B9AF8"/>
Exercises for a Time, they commonly have some renew'd divine Manifestations, and be∣gin to think their Mountain stands strong, and that henceforth they shall never be moved; yet sometimes Darkness and Trouble again succeed. Thus Light and Darkness, Hopes and Fears are interchanging, and they have great Variety of Exercises, Frames and Feel∣ings: And thereby make Progress in the ex∣perimental Knowledge of useful and important Truths. Some that had not at first such clear Manifestations, by renew'd and more clear Discoveries, have now obtain'd comfortable or full Assurance of the Love of God. Others are still exercised with Hopes and Fears, find∣ing such remains of Sin in their Hearts, as seems to them almost inconsistent with the in Being of Grace. They in general appear to have increasing Acquaintance with their own Hearts, and see more and more clearly the Need of progressive Sanctification. They once saw their Hearts to be exceeding bad, but now say, they see them ten Times worse than ever they thought they were: They did not imagine there was so much Darkness and un∣subdued Sin in them as now they perceive, and groan under: And thereby learn the Ne∣cessity of the constant Use of the <HI>Mediator Christ Jesus;</HI> and their Need of the sanctify∣ing Influences of the Holy Spirit. They ap∣pear
<PB N="40" REF="010250_0057_0F7E259650FCC528"/>
to be engaged in a Warfare with Sin, <HI>Satan,</HI> and the <HI>World,</HI> and to be learning De∣pendence upon the Lord Christ, for Victory and eternal Triumph. they are pressing after Holiness of Heart and Life, and thereby in general exhibit Evidence, they have a Change of Nature. They all appear unwilling to rest in any present Attainments, and averse to a bad Temper of Heart, and resolved to follow on to know more of God and Christ, and to be∣come more rich in Experience of divine Grace, They profess to give their Hearts to the Lord, and to devote their Lives to Him as their reason∣able Service. Their Hope purifies, and their Faith produceth Obedience and the Fruits of Holiness. They practically declare that they look upon the <HI>Scripture</HI> Doctrine of Salvation by free and sovereign Grace, to be a Doctrine according to Godliness. They acknowledge <HI>Christ</HI> to be both <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> and ex∣pect Salvation from <HI>Sin,</HI> as well as <HI>Wrath,</HI> by Him. In general, they walk in the Fear of the Lord, and at Times in the Comforts of the Holy Ghost. In fine, while they behold the Glory of God shining in the Gospel <HI>Plan</HI> of Salvation, and are expecting Justification by the imputed Righteousness of Christ, they have the clearest and strongest Conviction of the Obligation of God's unchangeable Law upon them: And the deepest Sense of the Evil of
<PB N="41" REF="010250_0058_0F7E25999AF473A0"/>
Sin in itself, and most awful Views of its Dan∣ger: and the highest Sense of the Purity and Holiness of the divine Nature: And having a supreme Love to God, under a spi∣ritual Sight and Sense of his infinite Glory and Beauty: And Gratitude and Thankfulness also inducing, they find themselves in the strongest Manner possible, under Obligation to be intire∣ly and for ever devoted to God, his Service and Glory. And accordingly in some good Measure, are shewing forth the Virtues and Praises of <HI>Him,</HI> who hath call'd them (as they hope) out of Darkness into marvellous Light. Some other Fruits and Effects of divine Influ∣ence in <HI>this Day,</HI> will be occasionally interspersed under some following Remarks and Reflections.</P>
<P>I was not in hast to have the professed Sub∣jects of this Work admitted to the <HI>Lord'</HI>s <HI>Sup∣per:</HI> Choosing rather there should be some Time of Trial, searching of Heart, and seri∣ous Consideration, preparatory. Lord's-Day July 15th. Ninety eight Persons were added to the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, at one Time: And since that Time twenty four more. I yet expect large Accessions, many having conversed with me relative thereto; and there being a large Number more, who hope they have experienced a saving Change, in this Day; and there being none at present belonging to our <HI>Communion</HI> under fifteen Years of Age. 'Tis an universal
<PB N="42" REF="010250_0059_0F7E259A141501A8"/>
Opinion and Principle embraced by <HI>my</HI> People that no Person ought to be a <HI>Guest</HI> at the holy <HI>Supper,</HI> without the wedding Garment of im∣puted <HI>Righteousness</HI> and inherent <HI>Holiness,</HI> deri∣ved from Christ our Lord Redeemer. There∣fore our Candidates for Communion, have or∣dinarily great Searchings of Heart, and Exer∣cises of Mind, previous to their offering them∣selves for Admission, least they should come and eat and drink <HI>Judgment</HI> to <HI>themselves.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's People through the whole <HI>Sum∣mer,</HI> seem'd to have a remarkable Spirit of Prayer: And we had numerous Instances of Persons meeting with Light and Comfort, so that the Lord's Work made a glorious and astonishing Progress among <HI>us:</HI> And we were often refreshed, by heating of its prevailing Power and Glory in many other Places. It was worthy of special <HI>Notice,</HI> that in the latter Part of <HI>Summer,</HI> a considerable Number of Persons, who had for Years been labouring under Hopes and Fears, and from the Begin∣ing of the Work among us, been greatly ex∣ercised about their spiritual State, now appear'd favour'd with clear divine Manifestations, and much Light and Comfort. In the <HI>Autumn</HI> and fore Part of Winter it became Apparent, that the divine Influences were in a Measure sus∣pended, especially as to renewing Operations upon the Hearts of Sinners: Tho' in other
<PB N="43" REF="010250_0060_0F7E259B4AB5C2A0"/>
Respects we enjoy'd special Tokens of God's gracious Presence with us. In the latter Part of Winter and the Begining of the Spring, the Lord was pleased in a remarkable Manner to set his Seal, and give his own blessed Testimony, to his own most glorious Work among us, by more plentiful Effusions of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> than had been given for some Months before. The Concern of Sinners was increased, some few hoped they received divine Light and Comfort: And many of God's People had much divine Refreshment, and several of our young Christians firm Establishment. One aged Man, even above 72 Years of Age, who had long been under powerful <HI>Con∣viction,</HI> at this Time, met with Light and Comfort, which increas'd upon him, for about six Weeks, when he departed this Life, in the highest Triumphs of Faith. It may be worthy of a Remark; that the few who have died among us, who hoped they received the Grace of God in this <HI>Day,</HI> have given us just Occasion to conclude they left this World, in the Triumphs of Faith with full Assurance of eternal Glory.</P>
<P>The Shower of divine Blessings in this <HI>Day,</HI> hath been very extensive as to Numbers, who hope they have been savingly wrought upon, and as to Persons of various Ages. There are from Six or Seven Years of Age to above
<PB N="44" REF="010250_0061_0F7E259B9DA46CB8"/>
Seventy who hope they have received the saving Grace of God in this <HI>Day.</HI> Yet I think the Work hath been principally among our young People. I am not able to inform what Number of Persons entertain Hopes they have been savingly called, in this Day. I have never pretended to number them, nor have I heard that any Person has made the Attempt, unless by Way of General Conjecture. 'Tis not the Practice of <HI>my People</HI> to pronounce one Another <HI>Converts:</HI> To say such a one is <HI>converted,</HI> is a Term I have not used myself; nor have I heard it used by my People, to be sure very rare, if ever, in this Day. The general Term hath been such a one, by Name, hopes he, or she, hath received <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Comfort.</HI> Altho' some may think this is <HI>Tantamount</HI> or equiva∣lent, to saying such a one is <HI>converted;</HI> I take the Liberty to suppose the former is a <HI>Term</HI> that is more <HI>Suitable,</HI> since we know so little of our own Hearts and much less of the Hearts of others. Some may possibly imagine, that I am transported above Measure with the Lord's Work, that, I take all for Gold that glistens, and every Pang of Devotions, for real Religion, and am fond of Numbers; and exceed∣ing charitable; whereas, I suppose if such Persons, fully knew my Sentiments about a saving Change of <HI>Heart,</HI> and what Holiness of <HI>Life,</HI> I expect thereupon, they would likely
<PB N="45" REF="010250_0062_0F7E259C517BB540"/>
judge, I am a very uncharitable <HI>Man.</HI> How∣ever, neither the one nor the other gives me Concern personally considered. The Lord's Work is known, perfectly known, by Himself in all its Glory; how muchsoever concealed from the Eye of <HI>Man.</HI> It hath been a Re∣mark repeatedly made by <HI>Strangers,</HI> who have come to us from afar, and abode with us for some Time, that People in remote Parts, in no due Measure at all, form'd a just Conception of the Power and Glory of the Lord's Work among us. I am far from supposing that every one is <HI>new Born,</HI> that is the Subject of such a Hope: There is a vast Variety of <HI>Cases,</HI> some more and some less hopeful. Upon the whole; I am free to declare in the Face of the World, that so far as I am capable by the Help of God's Word of judging of Things of this Nature, I have Reason to entertain Hopes, that a very great Number of my <HI>dear People,</HI> have in this <HI>Day</HI> of marvellous Grace, "passed from Death to Life:" I have all the Evidence I can reasonably expect, and such as is sufficient to induce me to give God the Glory, and to take the Comfort thereof, (which is quite enough for me) while I pre∣tend not to know the Heart. I flatter not myself, that there will be no Instances of Hypocrisy and Apostacy at such a <HI>Season;</HI> Scripture and past Observations lead us to ex∣pect
<PB N="46" REF="010250_0063_0F7E259D1839DFB0"/>
somewhat of such a Kind. At the same Time, that I have looked upon this Work much more free from corrupt Mixtures in general, than ever I knew a Work of this Kind, so I have been hoping that Instances of Apostacy would not be so numerous, as some∣times in such a Day; and as yet I have ample Grounds to retain such a Hope. We have often been bid to wait for <HI>Fruits,</HI> Fruits of Holiness have been justly expected, and bles∣sed be God! They now appear and give Con∣firmation of a marvellous Work of God's Grace among us. I have the rather delayed the Publication of this <HI>Narrative,</HI> because I knew what was expected by many, in order to their Faith concerning the Lord's Work. 'Tis now above a Year and a half since the Work began among us so powerfully, and if visible <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Holiness,</HI> exhibit any Evidence of God's Work of astonishing Grace among us, this Work must be allow'd by ample Proof, to be a marvellous Work of God's Grace. 'Tis Matter of Joyful Admiration and Praise, that the Adversary as yet, hath had so little Occasion to blaspheme. We have indeed Occasion to lament, that we have no more of the Life and Power of Religion a∣mong us. We are praying for divine Influ∣ences in more copious Measures. We have several praying <HI>Societies,</HI> and Meetings every
<PB N="47" REF="010250_0064_0F7E259E40989680"/>
Week for Prayer. In the after Part of the Day upon the first <HI>Wednesday</HI> of every Month, our people meet for Prayer: When many Prayers are offered up to God, that he would continue to pour out his <HI>Spirit</HI> upon us, and dwell with us, as his People: And also that according to his <HI>Promise,</HI> "He would pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh." We are still favoured with some special Tokens of the di∣vine Presence, and have Occasion to be a very humble thankful <HI>People,</HI> abounding in Fruits of Holiness. We have Reason to fear some have in a Measure lost their Concern, others seem still determined not to have Rest and Comfort; but in the Lord. We would fain hope the Harvest is not yet over, and hold on praying that we may yet see greater <HI>Things:</HI> Mean While, we doubt not, but that the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath been, and is with us, of a Truth, to whom be all the Glory of his own most blessed Work for ever and ever!</P>
<P>I have been desired, by a worthy <HI>Friend,</HI> greatly and justly renown'd for Learning, Piety, and extensive Usefulness in and to the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, to make some Remarks upon, and Reflections relative to this Work of God's marvellous Grace among us. To which I now proceed.</P>
<P>In and by such a Work, as it is the effectual Application of Redemption, there is the brightest
<PB N="48" REF="010250_0065_0F7E259E958E7A78"/>
Display of all the divine Perfections. The unsearchable Wisdom, the boundless Goodness, the Almighty Power, the spotless Holiness, the adorable Sovereignty, the inflexible Justice, and inviolable Truth of God, shine in this great Work with united Splendor. All the Divine Attributes keep their Place and Rank, and appear and beam out eternally, in all the Glory that becomes the transcendent Majesty of God.</P>
<P>Such a Work serves to confirm the Divinity of the Gospel, and the Reality of divine Influ∣ences in our Day. Every Soul brought from a <HI>State of Nature</HI> to a <HI>State of Grace,</HI> and made fruitful in Holiness, may be reckon'd a new Miracle in Confirmation of the Truth of the Gospel, and of the divine Influences. All the Force of meer moral Suasion could never effect such divine Productions, as we here behold. Nothing short of the Influences of the Holy Spirit associated with the <HI>divine Word,</HI> can produce such excellent and super∣natural Effects. As to the <HI>Subjects</HI> of this Work they are all assured that the Gospel is divinely true, <HI>and the Words of eternal Life.</HI> No Person can be the Subject of this Work, and imagine that the Influences of the Holy Spirit were confin'd and restricted to the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Age, and are not now to be expected.</P>
<P>This Work appears glorious and worthy of special Notice with Respect to Extent,
<PB N="49" REF="010250_0066_0F7E25A1DF9BACC0"/>
and the Numbers hopefully wrought upon in this Day. It hath not been confined to one <HI>Place,</HI> or a few <HI>Places</HI> only; but the heavenly Shower hath come down upon a great many Congregations. This Work hath been more or less considerable in 12 or 14 Congreations up∣on this <HI>Island:</HI> And in some of <HI>them,</HI> very powerful and glorious. There hath been much of this blessed Work in several <HI>Towns</HI> in the <HI>Jerseys.</HI> I saw much of the good Effects thereof, when in those Parts the last <HI>Fall,</HI> upon a preaching <HI>Journey:</HI> And had very agreable Accounts given me of this Work in many Congregations, by a Number of my Rev. <HI>Brethren</HI> in the <HI>Ministry,</HI> who appeared heartily and laborously engaged to promote this glorious Work in those <HI>Parts.</HI> I should per∣haps be inexcusable, not to observe, that I have often received good Intelligence of the agreable Effects of divine Influence upon the Minds of many People in the City of <HI>New-York.</HI> I am informed that very many of the Inhabitants of that <HI>Metropolis</HI> belonging to various Con∣gregations, hopefully share largely in the special Blessings <HI>of this Day,</HI> of the Out-pouring of the Holy Spirit. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Charles-Jeffery Smith,</HI> who is abundant in Labours to promote the Redeemer's Kingdom, and hath been the Winter past in <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> writes to one of his <HI>Correspondents,</HI> "that he had
<PB N="50" REF="010250_0067_0F7E25A2CB7A3B80"/>
lately been preaching among People, upon whom the Dews of heavenly Influences were descending, as upon the People of <HI>Long-Island</HI> the last Summer." I have often received In∣formation of the Power and Progress of this Work in several Places in <HI>New-England.</HI> But it can't be reasonably expected, that I should be particular in giving an Account of this Work in other <HI>Places,</HI> as I am with Respect to it, among my <HI>own People:</HI> Yet I have thought proper to hint thus much, it being one Branch of the Glory of the Lord's Work at this Day, that 'tis so extensive. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Since the above was written, I have read the Copy of a Letter, sent from a Friend of</HI> Zion <HI>in</HI> Holland <HI>to a Friend in</HI> New-York, <HI>in which mention is made of a considerable revival of the Lord's Work in several</HI> Places <HI>in</HI> Holland, <HI>within a few Months past. By Accounts given in that Letter, the Work of Conviction and Conversion is going on in several Places: "And some old pious People are obliged to acknowledge that their Hearts are joyful in the Lord to the highest Pitch." The Letter is dated,</HI> Amsterdam <HI>July</HI> 12. 1765.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Lord's Work in this Day, hath ap∣pear'd some what singular and extraordinary with respect to Degrees and Measures of di∣vine Influence, Power and Purity, Light and
<PB N="51" REF="010250_0068_0F7E25A3EBFED528"/>
Comfort. In general, the Work of the Law hath been very powerful, clear, and distinct: And divine Manifestations thereupon equally so. Many of the Lord's People have been so re∣plenished with Light and Comfort, as that <HI>their Cup hath run over,</HI> and there has not been Room to receive the Blessing some old Dis∣ciples among us, for now above a Year seem to have been favour'd with the continual, un∣clouded Shines of <HI>Jehovah'</HI>s precious Favour, and almost uninterrupted, solemn, and delight∣ful Communion with Him. They appear con∣tinually delighting themselves in the great, I AM, as the Fountain of all Good, and the Portion of their Souls for ever; and their de∣votedness to his Glory is in full Proportion. The Prelibations of Heaven's Glory are now so given, and <HI>New-Jerusalem</HI> so come down from above, with Respect to some Persons a∣mong us in Months past, that with Regard to them, the latter Day Glory is already come; unless we suppose (which I believe will be) that when that Day fully comes, the Lord will en∣large the essential Powers, as well as spiritual Principles of his People, so that they will be made strong to bear the Weight of Joy and Glory, beyond all that hath as yet been known upon Earth: In that Day,—The Feeble shall be as <HI>David,</HI> and the House of <HI>David</HI> shall
<PB N="52" REF="010250_0069_0F7E25A49760E4D0"/>
be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 8. <HI>Isai.</HI> Ix. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Work hath been remarkable for a Spi∣rit of Love and Benevolence;—And Freedom from Bitterness;—And for carrying its own Evidence with it;—And for inconsiderable Op∣position, where it hath made Progress. For Brevity Sake, I throw a Cluster of Remarks together. The <HI>Spirit</HI> of this Day eminent∣ly consists in superlative Love to God, and the Saviour; in a reigning Love to the Word, Ordinances, and People of God; and a Dis∣position to universal Benevolence. I never knew People converse with one another, more freely and plainly about the State of each others Souls than in this Day; yet I never heard, nor heard of one bitter harsh Expression, nor an Instance of rash censorious judging, by any one of the Subjects of this Work, from the Day it begun among us, to this very Day. All appear'd to be spoken in Love, and with Be∣nevolence, and was so received: As if the God of Love, was come down to reign among us, by the Power of Love divine.—Thus this Work hath carried its own Evidence with it: Also in that the Subjects of it, whether dis∣tressed, or comforted, have in general been capable of giving a rational <HI>scriptural</HI> Ac∣count
<PB N="53" REF="010250_0070_0F7E25A55328A9C0"/>
of their Exercises of Mind: And in that they appear'd in Practice what they pro∣fessed. By what I have seen and heard, I have Reason to believe Hundreds, if not Thousands, have had their Prejudices against experimental Religion removed from their Minds, by this Work, which hath carried such Evidence with it, that 'tis of God.—Was it not for an un∣happy opposing few, this Work would almost want one Evidence of being a Work of God. We <HI>here,</HI> have seldom ever heard the Word Opposer mentioned in <HI>this Day:</HI> It seem'd to be the general Concern of People to share in the Work; and not to appear with a Spirit of Opposition. By what I have heard, it hath been much so in other Places, where this Work hath made considerable Progress. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Prime,</HI> in a Letter dated Huntington 8th. of May 1764, writes thus, <Q>Altho' there are some among us, I hope but very few, that oppose themselves, yet blessed be God, his glorious Work of Grace goes on here! The greatest Part of our <HI>People</HI> seem to be solemniz'd and made thoughtful. Not a few wounded deeply at Heart, and groaning under Burdens insupportable, some under shuddering Horror, fearful Apprehensions of divine Wrath.</Q> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of <HI>Morris Town,</HI> in a Letter dated July 13th. 1764. Thus informs, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>The Lord Jehovah hath
<PB N="54" REF="010250_0071_0F7E25A627703CB8"/>
rent his Heavens and come down, and the Mountains are fleeing at his Presence, I am surprised at the Progress and Success of this Work; nor is their any considerable Oppo∣sition. There is some thing of this blessed Work all around me.</Q> &amp;c. There are such Marks and Signatures of a divine Impress, attending this Work, as that it appears most unreasonably Vile, and Wicked, to make Opposition.</P>
<P>This Work hath been uncommonly free from meer imagination, and <HI>Satanical</HI> De∣lusion. 'Tis not to be wondered at, if in such a Day, some Persons have imaginary Notions; nor if Satan have a Hand in some woful De∣lusions. The Devil hath sometimes, perhaps, too much atributed to him and sometimes not enough. The due Consideration of human Nature under intense Exercises and Affections of Mind, will sufficiently help us to account for a Train of strong and pleasing Imaginations, and a Kind of delightful Visions. But utmost Care and Caution is to be used, that Persons don't lay Stress upon such <HI>Things,</HI> as tho' they were Visions, divine Revelations, and high Attainments in Religion: For then the Word of God, as the Rule of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> will be treated with Neglect; and such Persons will likely be led a woful Jaunt by the Devil. I have conversed with but very few Persons in this
<PB N="55" REF="010250_0072_0F7E25A6D0801B18"/>
Day that have made any Mention of any thing that appeared to be meerly Imaginary, and them mostly Servants, that I suppose could not read. None among us make the least Pre∣tence to Visions and Revelations, as above mentioned. Intellectual and Spiritual Views of divine Objects, as externally revealed in the <HI>Word,</HI> and Transformation of Soul, by the Il∣lumination of the Holy Spirit and the Comfort and Blessedness that accompanies, are the Pur∣suit of the Subjects of this Work among us.</P>
<P>According to the Lord's Manner of Dis∣pensation in this Work 'tis not his Method of Operation to take Sinners out of a State of Security in Sin, Guilt and Condemnation, immediately into a State of Justification, Sancti∣fication, Rest and Comfort; Greatness of En∣deavour after Salvation, a Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> and Humiliation preceed. Sinners are first brought to a Sight of themselves in their true and proper Character, as given by the <HI>Law</HI> of God, in which Glass they see their Sin, Guilt, and Danger of eternal Damnation: And when the Light of Truth shines in the Conscience, it makes the stoutest Heart to trem∣ble. Then Sinners become anxious, use great Endeavours, utter Cries for Mercy, and strive even to an Agony, for Salvation. The Spirit of God puts Sinners upon utmost Endeavours after Salvation; but not upon resting in them. It
<PB N="56" REF="010250_0073_0F7E25A9E3834B18"/>
seems to me, if ever the Kingdom of Heaven was taken by Violence, it has been by Sinners among us <HI>in this Day.</HI> At the same Time, they have seen their absolute Inability to help themselves, approved of God's <HI>Law</HI> as just in their Condemnation, and found that the Spirit of God is a <HI>Convincer,</HI> before he is a <HI>Comforter.</HI> 'Tis true indeed, all have not in like Man∣ner such dreadful Terrors of <HI>legal Wrath,</HI> nor so deep a Sense of Hell and Damnation, nor have all in the same Method a clear dis∣tinct Work of the <HI>Law:</HI> The Holy Spirit is a Sovereign Agent; enlightned convinced Souls, are differently wrought upon herein. Proper Allowance is to be made for Persons of little <HI>doctrinal Knowledge,</HI> and some others, that have not had so clear a Work of the Law, if they are not able to give such a me∣thodical Account thereof, as would please the nice Taste of a learned <HI>metaphyfical Divine,</HI> we must not always throw them a way, as Christ∣less and Graceless: Especially if they appear convinced of Sin, and to have their Hope in themselves cut off, exalt Jesus Christ, as all in all, and appear heavenly in their Temper, and holy in their Walk and Conversation. Nor is it safe for any to conclude they have true Comfort, because it follow'd legal Terrors; this may be and yet the Soul not converted to Jesus and the Holiness of the Gospel: The
<PB N="57" REF="010250_0074_0F7E25AB683EF698"/>
grand Point we are to regard, as to our selves and others in our Judgement. Yet it doubt∣less holds True, that until Sinners see the Sin∣fulness of Sin, their lost State by Nature, the spirituality of the <HI>Law,</HI> their unworthyness of divine Mercy, they will not come to Christ for Salvation; nor are they like to have a Discovery of his Fulness and Glory. An Im∣perfect Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> and a Misapplica∣tion of the Gospel, is no doubt, the Ruin of many Souls. Such as imagine there is no Knowledge of Sin by the <HI>Law,</HI> and Spirit of God, given before saving Faith, imagine, that which is Contrary to the Word of God, and the Experience of his People in all Ages.</P>
<P>According to this Work of God, it appears evident by the Confessions of the Subjects thereof, that in real Submission to a sovereign God, Sinners can plead no Scripture Promises of Grace and Salvation, made to the doings of the Unregenerate. They utterly discard such a legal Spirit, as the Result of Pride, and vain Conceit of doing something to make God a Debtor to Works, and as founded in Ignorance, both of ourselves, and the Word of God's rich Grace and free Promises, all Yea and Amen in Christ, unto the Glory of God. Nor do they come to Christ for Salvation, as first persuaded He died for them in particular; but merely upon the Encouragement of Gos∣pel
<PB N="58" REF="010250_0075_0F7E25AC1C67E578"/>
Calls and Invitations.</P>
<P>Such a work as this effectually attaches the Hearts of its Subjects to the whole <HI>System</HI> of Truths reveal'd in God's Word; and brings them in particular, to acknowledge these <HI>Doc∣trines,</HI> which for Distinction sake, are called <HI>Calvinistical:</HI> The lost and fallen State of Man by Nature; the absolute Necessity of Salvation by Jesus Christ;—the Pardon of Sin by the Riches of Divine Grace, through the impu∣red Righteousness of the Saviour;—Sanctifica∣tion and Comfort by the Holy Ghost:—These great Foundation Doctrines, together with o∣thers, that have so extensive an Influence on the whole of practical Religion, the Subjects of this Work embrace as true Scripture Doctrine. <HI>Socinion, Pelagian,</HI> and <HI>Arminion</HI> Doctrines, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Principles pernicious and destructive to the Souls of Men, however pleasing to corrupt Nature, can have no Place nor Being, where such a Work prevails in its Power. All the ela∣borate Performances and laboured Arguments, of great and sound Divines, are in no Measure comparable to such a Work of God, for the utter Abolition of corrupt Principles.</P>
<P>In the View of this Work, it appears un∣Ceasonable to lay Stress upon crying out under Conviction, as tho' necessary to a Law Work, and equally absurd to suppose Persons are deluded, because under a <HI>Law Work</HI> they
<PB N="59" REF="010250_0076_0F7E25ACD5E86218"/>
could not refrain. Many have and many have not gone the Length, to cry out under Soul Concern, they respectively, as to the main Strokes give the same Account, as to a Work of Conviction, and divine Manifestations and appear to walk with God, and to be equally holy in Life and Conversation: Now is it possible for any think∣ing Person, to conclude the Work hath been deficient in the one, and delusive in the other, meerly on Account of that which at most, is but a Circumstance that may, or may not attend Soul Concern and spiritual Exercises? No doubt, Persons ought to refrain as much as they can from making ado, especially in Time of Pub∣lick Worship. This is an establish'd Prin∣ciple among my People; nor have I, that I remember, been interrupted when Preaching so as to prevent my being heard in general, for the Space of two Minutes; yet we have often seen some so greatly distressed, and o∣thers so abundently comforted, as that it ap∣peared impossible for them to avoid undis∣sembled Expressions of each. But these Things are made no essential Part of Religion; nor do they give Offence when appearing una∣voidable. 'Tis abundently evident, that the great Distress of some, and the divine Com∣fort with which others have been replenished, have been eminently own'd and blessed, as a Means to promote the Work of God among
<PB N="60" REF="010250_0077_0F7E25AD93180FC0"/>
<HI>us.</HI> Therefore, I take the Liberty to think, that 'till Minister and People are truely wil∣ling the Lord should work in such a power∣ful Manner, his Way as yet, is not prepared for doing many great and mighty Things a∣mong them. Not that I approve of the Con∣duct of such Persons who give Vent to their Passions without Restraint, and affect to be noisy, at Pleasure, making the same ado, at one Time as well as another: They act a Part injurous to themselves, and prejudice many a∣gainst all extraordinary Appearances; especially when little or no Religion appears in their Lives and Conversation. Such Conduct when not out of Necessity, is the Way in Time to have all genuine Appearences lose all good Effect. But I think 'tis too much for the Clay to dictate to the <HI>Potter:</HI> God gives not Account of his Matters: Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord? With whom took He Counsel?—'Tis in vain to prescribe, after all, God will work like Himself, and will car∣ry on his Work in such a Manner as to show his own Glory, and exalt his own Sovereignty, and pour Contempt on human Strength and Wisdom.</P>
<P>Altho' The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation, like the Kingdoms of earthly Kings, set up with outward Pomp, yet the Revival of Religion among a People by a
<PB N="61" REF="010250_0078_0F7E25AE67F8CDA8"/>
plentiful Effusion of the Spirit, occasions a great Stir, and becomes publickly observable. When the Holy Spirit breathes upon the dry Bones in the Valley of Vision, what a Noise and Stir is made, by the Resurrection of a great Army to Life; and how observable the Effects?</P>
<P>Knowledge of, and Acquaintance with pro∣missory and prophetick Parts of <HI>Scripture</HI> may be of eminent use in such a Day: For Scripture Promises and Prophecies, are fully expressive of such marvellous Effusions of the Holy Spirit, and glorious Effects.</P>
<P>By such a Work, we learn that the Holy Spirit is an infinite Sovereign, in his Oppera∣tions, and thereby produces affecting Seperati∣ons. He grants his Influences when, where, upon whomsoever, and in what Measures and Degrees He pleaseth: And a Seperation is made between Persons of all Ranks, Ages, and Relations, and even dearest Friends may seem parted, while one is taken and another left.</P>
<P>By such a Work, Sinners are made to see, that Inability is no excuse for Infidelity, it being moral Indisposition; and are brought, to ap∣prove of God's <HI>Law,</HI> as being strictly just. And of the Gospel method of Salvation, as in∣finitely glorious</P>
<P>'Tis of no small Service to the Lord's Work, in such a Day, to have People well <HI>indoctrina∣ted,</HI> and to have a very considerable Number of solid judicious old Disciples in Christ rich
<PB N="62" REF="010250_0079_0F7E25AF10750728"/>
in Knowledge and Experience of divine Grace. They befriend Sinners under Convictions; and young Christians in their first Love, and afford them much Instruction amidst their new Expe∣riences and various Exercises. They happily often prevent wild Delusions.</P>
<P>The Subjects of such a Work highly esteem and inflexibly adhere to divine Institutions and holy Ordinances. They can't rest satisfied with empty <HI>Form</HI> void of Life and Power; they watch against the Wiles of <HI>enthusiastical Error;</HI> they pray much for the Aids and Assistance of the Blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> in all holy Duties: And especially to see Jehovah's stately Steppings in his <HI>Sanctuary;</HI> and that <HI>there,</HI> and even con∣tinually, they may share largely in the power∣ful purifying and consolatory Influences of the Holy Spirit upon their Hearts; enabling and disposing of them to universal Holiness of Life. Altho', to their Lamentation, they find they come vastly short of their Aims, yet thus they seek that <HI>Religion,</HI> which shines in the native Beauties of Holiness, and the ravishing Glories of a divine Impress.</P>
<P>I have had Occasion to remark, that when Preachers have insisted upon those Truths of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> that the Holy Spirit seemed to be making a powerful Application of to the Minds of People at <HI>this Time,</HI> and in a very plain Manner have exhibeted the blessed Jesus in all the Glories of his divine and mediatorial
<PB N="63" REF="010250_0080_0F7E25B1EBDD3F80"/>
Character, such Subjects and such a Method of Preaching, the Blessing of the Lord in a signal Measure rested upon, for the promoting this Work. Especially when the Preacher ap∣pear'd to have a great and solemn Sense of the Truths he deliver'd, and spake, "as in De∣monstration of the Spirit and of Power": Fre∣quently addressing the Consciences of Hearers in a pathetical and pungent Manner, often in the pointed Form of <HI>the Second Person,</HI> that <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners</HI> might have their Portion of the Word well divided and give the more Heed to an Address <HI>particularly directed. The Face</HI> of the Assembly in Time of Hearing, ordinarily seem'd to indicate a Blessing attending, such a Method and Manner of Preaching, Accounts afterwards received of the good Effects, gave Confirmation. Which hath often made me think, that the Goodness of preaching, must be determined, like that of a Tree, not by its Blossoms, but its Fruits. I can scarce forbear adding, that frequent Preaching, hath been eminently blessed for increasing and upholding Views of divine and eternal Things, in the Minds of <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI> Which hath often made me long and pray for that laborious Day, "when the <HI>Watchmen</HI> upon the Walls of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> shall never hold their Peace, Day nor Night," and the Gospel-Trumpet shall be blown by <HI>Zion's Priests,</HI> with one long, perpetual and powerful Blast, so that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="64" REF="010250_0081_0F7E25B2912AA358"/>
of <HI>Antichrist</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> like those of <HI>Jericho,</HI> shall fall down flat, and never more be erected.</P>
<P>While I have heard so many in this Day, inquiring with Anxiety, <HI>what they should do to be saved?</HI> It hath been natural to reflect that the Condition of many, must needs be lament∣able, in Places of awful Security. There were perhaps, as many hopefully truly pious Persons among us, before This Day, as in almost any Place for the Number of People; Yet a great many among us, as well the seemingly <HI>moral,</HI> as the awfully <HI>careless;</HI> and openly <HI>vicious,</HI> have seen themselves in a condemned perishing Condition: Our Young People in general, now know they were going in Companies to eternal Misery! Our Case is as yet, in a Measure mournful; how lamentable then must be the Condition of many Persons, in those Places, where the divine Influences have been awfully suspended for ten or Twenty Years past! What Bowels of God-like Pity, and Christ-like Compassion, should the pious few in such Places exercise towards the Multitudes around them, going <HI>down—down—down</HI> to everlasting Burn∣ings! How immensely shocking it must needs be, to a faithful Minister of Christ, to pass round about and behold, the breathless, lifeless, <HI>dry Bones,</HI> in such a Place! With what a pray∣ing Frame of Soul with what an aching, sighing Heart, shou'd and will he enter his Pulpit to Minister, in sacred Things, to the many perish∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="010250_0082_0F7E25B2DAED2C58"/>
Immortals before Him!</P>
<P>It seems to be a Token for good, when the Lord gives his People a Spirit of Prayer for the divine Influences, and brings <HI>Zion</HI> under labour∣ing Pangs for the Formation of Christ in the Souls of others: For this hath eminently been the Case among us as the Lord's Work began and made Progress, in this Day. However strange it may seem to some, we have serious People among us, who had a powerful Work of the <HI>Law,</HI> that declare they have undergone as much Distress for the Salvation of the Souls of others, as they did for their own. In some Instances I have known, I believe a Continu∣ance would soon have separated between Soul and Body. Thus have we had a faint Emblem of that amazing Day, when it shall be ask'd, "Who hath heard such a Thing? Who hath seen such Things? Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one Day? Shall a Nation be born at once? For as soon as <HI>Zion</HI> travel∣led she brought forth her Children."</P>
<P>Suppressing numerous Remarks and Reflec∣ions, I shall now only add, (with a little Scope) that such a Work as hath been narrated, may strengthen the Faith and Hope, and encourage the Prayers of the Lord's People for plentiful Effusions of the Holy Spirit. The same Mea∣sures of Light by the Holy Spirit will pro∣duce the same Effects: There is in this Case an inseparable Connection between Causes
<PB N="66" REF="010250_0083_0F7E25B39B8B4500"/>
and Effects. That <HI>Sum</HI> of all Blessings, now of such infinite Importance and Excellence, to be conferred upon us in <HI>all Places,</HI> without which the unconverted must assuredly perish for an endless evermore, is the powerful Illu∣mination and sanctifying Operation of the Holy Spirit. The Omnipotent Agency of the eter∣nal Spirit, and a Sight of Truth, in its vari∣ous needful Branches, by his sacred Illumina∣tion, will, and nothing short thereof can, pro∣duce those interesting Effects, and glorious Consequences, that God's People are longing and praying for. If he suspends his powerful Influence, Sinners by thousands around <HI>us,</HI> con∣tinue in their Security, in an habitual Alienation of Heart from the Life and Power of true Re∣ligion, and every Moment will be rushing on blindfold and unprepared into an amazing Eternity! 'Tis astonishing to the last Degree! That no more is said, that no more is heard, concerning the Holy Spirit's Operation, and that no more Honour is given Him, in the Affair of Man's eternal Salvation. The Lord's People need all possible Encouragement to pray for the infinitely important Blessing of the Out-pouring of the Holy Spirit; and some En∣couragement is given by his marvellous Descent upon an unworthy sinful People. Encouraged by the gracious Benignity of the Holy Spirit; by his Province in the OEconomy of Man's Salvati∣on; by the Purchase and Intercession of Christ
<PB N="67" REF="010250_0084_0F7E25B454B748A0"/>
by the Gospel's being the Ministration of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> by numerous Prophecies and Promises of the Spirit's Mission and Influences; by all past and present Operations;—in the View of the present and future blessed Effects and glo∣rious Consequences of his sacred Influences, surely the Lord's People can never faint, nor grow weary of praying: But use all their In∣terest in Heaven, to the utmost, be resolute, Importinate, and unceasing, 'till the Holy Spirit descends in Showers of Grace, upon the Church of Christ, and even upon the whole World. The great I AM, our all-sufficient God, perfectly and infinitely well knew, that He was equal to the Accomplishment of the Promises, He made to his eternal Son our <HI>divine Mediator,</HI> and those He hath given to his Church and People in and through Him, when he made <HI>them:</HI> And he made them with a Design to fullfil them, resol∣ving their exact Accomplishment, and that the Prayers of his People, should be a Means by which, He would execute his eternal Purpose. O! that we firmly believed these Things, and lived upon them! That we better knew who it is we pray to, and in whose Name, and what we pray for, when we pray for the Effusions of the Holy Spirit upon the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, and upon all <HI>Flesh!</HI> Then should we become wrestling <HI>Jacobs,</HI> and even prevailing <HI>Israels;</HI> giving our prayer hearing all-sufficient <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> no Rest, 'till He establish, and 'till He

make <HI>Jerusalem</HI> a Praise in <HI>all</HI> the Earth.</P>
<P>Thus I have given some Account of the late wonderful Appearance of the Revival of Religion among us: And made some Remarks thereupon knowing the Taste of the present Age in general, I am quite sensible that some will possibly Judge, I have been too Lengthy: But surely I have been very <HI>Brief,</HI> in the View of the extraordinariness of the Work itself. Amidst a Throng of visits and abounding Labours, <HI>as a hurried Man,</HI> I have taken hold on Time, to write the preceeding <HI>Narrative,</HI> for the Sake of <HI>those,</HI> who would read to improve for God's Glory, and the Furtherance of their own Salvation. It may be expected, that numerous and various Animadversions will be made, and very diverse Sentiments entertained relative to what I have written. If any should read what I have written, whose proper Cha∣ractor is, "that in Merriment, they are going on in the Way to eternal Misery," they will doubtless, (if not awaken'd thereby) disapprove and condemn; for such a Work, condemns to Death, their sinful sensual Pleasures. If any should read, who have at Times some superficial Thoughts about Religion, but never felt the Power of divine and eternal Things, have rarely heard, or not yet believed, there is a Holy Ghost, and who scarce know whether they give Sin and Death, a Judgement to come, Heaven and Hell a Place in their <HI>Creed,</HI> such Persons no

doubt will also disapprove; for such a <HI>Work;</HI> condemns their awful Infidellity in an inglorious Nutrallity. If any should read, who rest in the <HI>Form</HI> of Religion, and moderately acknowledge some insensible Operations of the Holy Spirit, but are unacquainted with his sacred Illuminati∣ons, and powerful Enlargements, who are apt to account Seriousness in Religion, Mopishness and melancholy; Self-denial over Preciseness; holy Singularity humourous Folly; serious speak∣ing, meer canting; real Humility, a Sort of Stupidity; exact Walking with God, a need∣less Scrupelosity; Faith of Things future, a fond Credulity; Zeal in a good Cause, Fervour in Devotions and earnest Conversing with God in humble Prayer, Enthusiasm; all such to∣gether with others more strictly attached to a <HI>Form</HI> of Duty void of Life and Power, will most probably disapprove of the work described in the preceeding Narrative: For such a Work makes null and void, all Pretences to real Religi∣on, without serious Soul Exercises, and the Pow∣er of Godliness, by the divine Influences. 'Tis probable that some will say, they approve of the Work in general but they disapprove of laying so much <HI>Stress</HI> upon such sudden marvellous Effusions of the Holy Spirit as seems to them is done in the Narrative. It may be consider'd, that it was not the Design of the Narrator to lay the <HI>Stress</HI> of the Work upon such Effu∣sions;—but to relate <HI>Facts:</HI> As knowing that
<PB N="70" REF="010250_0087_0F7E25B928C58BB8"/>
in order to such a Work's being judged of, there are but two Things which need be known; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> to judge by: The <HI>Rules</HI> of the Word of God, we have be∣fore <HI>us,</HI> and as to <HI>Facts</HI> there are but two Ways to obtain them, so as to be in a Capacity to compare them with the <HI>Rules,</HI> The one by our own Observation, the other by Information from others that had Opportunity to observe. I would hope that the <HI>Facts</HI> narrated, are so well attested, as in a Judgment of Charity, to demand Credibility. 'Tis true that there were, when this Work first began with great Power among us, some sudden, copious and astonishing Effu∣sions of the Holy Spirit: Such as I have seldom heard or read of since the primitive Times of <HI>Christianity.</HI> But before such Effu∣sions of the Holy Spirit are disapproved of, I would seek the Favour of my <HI>Reader,</HI> to give an Answer to the following Questions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> First, <HI>Watchman,</HI> what of the Night? or where is the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ <HI>now,</HI> according to Pro∣phecy, or in what Manner of Time does <HI>her</HI> present State seem to fall? Secondly, to give a critical, full, and just Exposition of the Pro∣mises and Prophecies that relate to the Man∣ner of the Holy Spirit's being pour'd out <HI>in these last Days,</HI> and as to Measures and De∣grees, with the Effects, by Way of Convic∣tion of Sin, divine Manifestations, Transfor∣mation, divine Peace Love, Joy Assurance of
<PB N="71" REF="010250_0088_0F7E25B9CBB6B7E0"/>
the divine Favour, and Fruits of universal Holiness. 'Tis beside my present Work, or I would show that the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, hath <HI>now</HI> full Warrant to expect such Effusions of the Holy Spirit; and prove from many typical Events, and express Scripture Promises and prophecies, that the <HI>Dispensation</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> is often to be expected in such a sudden powerful Manner, and in yet vastly more plen∣tiful Measures, attended with answerable ex∣traordinary Effects, and glorious Consequences. Yet I don't suppose such Descents of the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> as now mentioned, essentially necessary to the Progress of the Lord's Work in some good Degree, altho' the reality of his Influence and Operation is: I have often seen the Work of God going on with Great Power and Glory, where such sudden copious amazing <HI>Dispensa∣tions</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> were not taking Place. Some that read, will perhaps say they have nothing to object, only that some of the Sub∣jects of this <HI>Work</HI> appear to have been too much under the Power of legal Terror, in too great Earnest for Salvation, and beyond all Reason affected with Danger of perishing. 'Tis true, as hath been related, that the Subjects of this Work in general, have had a deep and dis∣tressing Sense of Guilt, Wretchedness and Danger, and have seen the <HI>Law</HI> of God strictly <HI>just,</HI> in their eternal Condemnation, be∣fore they submitted to sovereign Mercy, and
<PB N="72" REF="010250_0089_0F7E25BA6B9CAC40"/>
had a View of the infinite Safety and Excel∣lence of the Gospel <HI>Plan</HI> of Salvation: And some in particular had dreadful <HI>Terrors</HI> of <HI>le∣gal Wrath,</HI> and were in Agonies of Distress for a <HI>Saviour,</HI> it may be remember'd, that 'tis the Office of the Holy Spirit <HI>to convince of Sin,</HI> by his powerful <HI>Agency;</HI> that our Lord Christ often tells us in the plainest Terms, "That the Whole need not the Physician;" "That he came to call Sinners to Repen∣tence"; And that in particular He invites "the weary and heavy laden to come to Him for Rest"; and commands us to strive even to an Agony for Salvation; and justifies taking the Kingdom of God by Violence. And as there is nothing unscriptural in great legal Terrors and distressing Soul Concern, what is there unreasonable? When Sinners are brought by the divine Law and <HI>Spirit,</HI> to view their Wickedness unutterably great, and to hear the Thunders of offended <HI>Jehovah</HI> as immensly terrible, and realize Hell's Misery, as infinitely dreadful, and to see themselves every Moment in Jeopardy of flaming Ruin, just ready to be swallowed up in the bottomless Gulf of the eternal Wrath of All-mighty God, can it possibly be thought unreasonable or strange, that Sinners under such Views and Apprehensions, are greatly moved and affected? I rather think it strange that they draw the Breath of Life. Eternity is so yast, and spiritual, immortal Things of such infi∣nite
<PB N="73" REF="010250_0090_0F7E25BB10E539D0"/>
Concern, that to be only moderately moved by and affected with them is in the Nature of Things, a grand Absurdity. Some indeed have not so great Terrors, and so deep a Sense of Hell and Damnation, as others, before they come to <HI>Jesus:</HI> But all come as Guilty justly condemned Sinners, Some have great legal Terrors, and receive no true Comfort; others, that have been under amazing legal Terrors, do and prove excellent Christians. In this Case we are not so much to regard the Manner of Operation by the Holy Spirit, as the Effect of his Operation, appearing by the Fruits that fol∣low—some who read, may observe, that they think the Effect of the Work in general to be good, in that the Subjects of it seem to be alter'd for the better; but they talk so much about <HI>Light</HI> and the <HI>Spirit's Illumination</HI> as seems to them to saviour of an enthusiastical Turn of Mind. 'Tis true, there is much said by the Subjects of this Work concerning the Excel∣lence and Importance of the Holy Spirit's Ope∣ration and Illumination. They perceive the natural Man discerns not spiritual Things;—That unenlightened Sinners are Darkness in the Abstract;—that none are born again, but by the <HI>Spirit;</HI> that they who know the Lord's <HI>Name,</HI> trust in Him;—that he that seeth the <HI>Son</HI> believeth;—that the Lord shines by his Spirit into the Heart, when his Glory in the Face of Christ is beheld; and that by a Sight
<PB N="74" REF="010250_0091_0F7E25BC17266058"/>
of this Glory they are changed from <HI>Glory</HI> to <HI>Glory,</HI> as by the Spirit; they find they can't act their own Graces, nor perform Duties evangelically, nor see the infinite Beauty of mo∣ral Excellence; nor know the Things freely given them of God; nor enjoy the Comfort of Religion, but by the Holy Spirit's Illumi∣nation, Aid and Assistance, therefore they talk so much concerning his Operations and Illu∣minations, even as <HI>all</HI> in <HI>all,</HI> in Point of Agency, in the Business of Religion. Some who read this Narrative, may possibly allow, that Sin∣ners indeed, may be justly affected with Dan∣ger to the last Degree; but they can't account for such great Joy and Comfort as is narrated. We readily acknowledge, that this Coronation Day of <HI>King Jesus,</HI> has been a Day of great and solemn Joy among us. Not only among Prodigals return'd (as they hope) to the <HI>Father</HI> of <HI>Mercies,</HI> and made to enjoy the precious Shines of his Fovour, and the special Tokens of his Choice and incomparable Love; but also among the Lord's People in general, as brought into his Banqueting-house with the Banner of divine Love displayed. Some old <HI>Disciples,</HI> well acquainted with the Nature and Essence of Religion, who have walk'd with God for above twenty Years, have now more Comfort in one Day sensibly so, than in a Year before, and that for hundreds of Days together. I can instance in a Person, that has
<PB N="75" REF="010250_0092_0F7E25BC9077A708"/>
sought the Lord with a Hope of being in his Favour for fifty Years past, that has enjoy'd more sensible Communion with God, and Evi∣dence of his Favour in one Day of late, than for fifty Years past: And can give an Instance of another of ninety four Years of Age who for seventy Years has been seeking God with a purifying Hope of an Interest in his Love, enjoy∣ing (as I have Reason to believe) more of the sensible gracious Presence of God and divine Comfort since this Day among us, than for seventy Years before: So that Youth is re∣new'd. The Lord's People did not know be∣fore that so much of Heaven was to be enjoy'd upon Earth. While divine Glories have been open'd to View, divine Comforts have run high. When true Believers in Christ have en∣lighten'd Views of the joint Illustration of infi∣nite Justice and Mercy, and of the Harmony and Glory of all the divine Attributes in the Gospel <HI>Plan</HI> of Salvation, and a Sight of the Glory and Sufficiency of the divine Jesus, and of the moral Beauty and Excellence of the Things of God, what is there unscriptural or unreasonable in their rejoicing with <HI>glorified Joy,</HI> even while abased in the View of their own infinite unlikeness to spotless Rectitude and Per∣fection? That Hypocrites and Stony-Ground Hearers have false Joys, arising from the Thought that they please God, or that He is pleased with them, or from some Impulses or
<PB N="76" REF="010250_0093_0F7E25BFD84D5810"/>
imaginary Views and Notions, is an undoubted Truth. Now, because there have been some, who seem, to have raised Affections and great Joy, for a Time, that have fallen into Error, or their Affections and Joys have come to nothing, great Numbers thereupon, appear dis∣posed to reject and discard all raised Affection in Religion, and even the sublime and heavenly Joys of the Lord's People in Him; without Distinction they account all is Delusion. Which is the Way to bring all Religion to a meer lifeless Formality and effectually to shut out the Power of Godliness, and which directly tends to make ten Times as many formal Hypocrites, as there are made by false Com∣forts. The Truth is, there are false Affections and Joys, and there are true; and proper Dis∣tinction is to be made between them; and the power of Godliness to be insisted upon and urged at the same Time: For true Religion is ever more a powerful <HI>Thing.</HI> Altho' there is no true Religion where there is nothing but Affection, there being something else in it be∣side Affection, yet there is no true Religion without the Affections. The Religion of Hea∣ven very much consists in holy Love and Joy, and so does true Religion upon Earth. If the Mind has answerable Light and Knowledge of the moral Excellence and Beauty of divine Objects, and the Person proportionable Hu∣mility, true mourning for Sin, and real de∣devotedness
<PB N="77" REF="010250_0094_0F7E25C051FAB4F8"/>
to God, no Matter how high holy Love and Joy arise, if even to celestial Flame and Rapture, all the better. Who shall limmit our God, saying such a Degree of the Earnest of heavenly Happiness shall be given upon Earth, and no more? 'Tis evident from the Prophecies, that there is a glorious Day approaching, of such Out-pourings of the Holy Spirit, as will introduce eminently holy and joyful Times; and what if that Day already begins to dawn? Possibly some who read, may approve of all that is <HI>narrated</HI> except∣ing only the great Distress of some Persons for others, which is a Difficulty with them without a Solution. The best Way in this Case, is to be∣come seriously, deeply &amp; joyfully impressed with a Sense of the infinite Preciousness of Jehovah's Favour; and of the beatitudes of the Sanctuary of Immortallity, by present solemn Delightful Com∣munion with the adorable <HI>Trinity;</HI> and to gain a sight of IMMANUEL'S Glory, and a Sense of the Riches and freeness of his Grace and con∣straining Love; thereby a true Apprehension of the immense Worth of Souls; and thereupon a realizing View of the infinite Dreadfulness of eternal Seclusion from Heaven's Joys and Glories; and of the Danger Sinners are in every Moment of sinking down under the amazing Crush of the threaten'd, just, omnipotent Ven∣geance of the ever living God, for an endless
<PB N="78" REF="010250_0095_0F7E25C147FD70D0"/>
Eternity. Such, and such like Views, with a good understanding of the many <HI>Scriptures</HI> that speak of Zion's labouring Pangs, for the New∣birth of Souls, will best give a Solution of the present Difficulty. All the Lord's People have not had equal Measures of Light, Distress, and Comfort; but they know how to argue from the less to the greater: If such given Measures of divine Influence and Light produce such Effects, no doubt higher Measures will produce answerable Effects: Thus Experience does be∣friend us.</P>
<P>Some may acknowledge wonderful Effects produced, but then they resolve them mostly into Pulpit-Gesture, striking Phraseology, Mo∣dulation of Voice, and sound, or heated Imagin∣ation, something Constitutional, or mechanical Operation. No doubt the Passions may be strongly touched, and the affections greatly mo∣ved, and yet the Mind remain uninlighten'd, the Heart unrenewed, and the Life unreformed. However, this proves nothing against the pow∣erful Effects of a preached Gospel, accompanied by the divine Influences. Altho' transient Passions and superficial Emotions, may ebb and flow with the animal Spirits, operating by a mechanical Force, as raised by the trivial Arts of puerile Oratory; yet there is a pathetick Manner of Preaching; that has in it a Sort of ir∣resistable Authority: while the Preacher comes
<PB N="79" REF="010250_0096_0F7E25C1D312DFA0"/>
home to the great Concerns and Feelings of Mankind, he seeks to interest Reason in his Cause, at the same Time, enlightens, touches the Passions and warms: Which nevertheless passeth with many for enthusiastick Heat, and affected Singularity. When the Lord hath been with and assisted Ministers, in a Day of the <HI>Spirit'</HI>s Out pouring, and gave the Blessing, and People have been greatly affected with their eternal Concernments, how common hath it been for some to raise a Cry, that the <HI>Preach∣ers</HI> played artfully on the Peoples Passions, at the Expence of their Reason. After all, we must attribute divine Productions to their proper Cause. Let all serious People judge, whether such uniform Effects, and glorious Productions, as I have narrated, can take Place, without an adequate Cause, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a divine Agency: While in the present Case we Judge by <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Fruits,</HI> as our Lord hath directed. Thus I have thought proper, in a Measure to digress, not meerely for the Vindication of the Lord's Work; but if possible to remove the prejudices of some, that they may receive the greater Be∣nefit. "When they heard these Things they held their Peace."</P>
<P>When there hath been an Harvest, we expect a threshing and winnowing Time will follow. The great Out-pouring of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the A∣postles Days, and the History of the <HI>Church</HI> in
<PB N="80" REF="010250_0097_0F7E25C29CB6A1B8"/>
various Ages, will teach us to expect Instances of Apostacy following such a Day as this. Some who have gained the Charity of the Lord's People, will likely fall away, and their fair Appearances come to Nothing. The Lord's People, who know experimentally what true Religion is, will not thereupon turn <HI>Scepticks;</HI> but as having increasing Acquaintance with Things of this Kind, will doubtless be ready to adopt, the Sayings of that excellent <HI>Casuist,</HI> and great <HI>Man</HI> in his Day, <HI>President Edwards,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>I once did not imagine the Heart of Man had been so unsearchable as I find it is. I am less charitable and less uncharitable than once I was. The longer I live, the less I wonder that God challenges it as his Pero∣gative to try the Hearts of the Children of Men.</Q>—We have not such a Spirit of Discerning that we can absolutely determine who are Godly, and who are not: For we can neither see nor feel, the internal Exercises of Grace in others. How often have we seen Persons, who seem'd for a Time to have the same Exercises with real Converts, yet after all their bright Appearances have fallen away, and become awful Apostates; while others have persevered and shined in all the Beauties of universal Holiness. Ordinarily in such a Day as this, there are some Persons, who appear opposite to the power of Godliness. Other
<PB N="81" REF="010250_0098_0F7E25C351EB8258"/>
are only shock'd by means of the extraordinary Appearances of Things; and when their Sur∣prize is over, they return to Sin, and Folly as before. Some that were under powerful Con∣victions of Sin and Misery, lose their Concern, and after the Restraint of their Corruptions for a Time, they often break out with the greater Violence and their "last State is worse than their first." Others that had legal Terrors, having got false Comforts they at Length one after another Fall away, and become Apostates. Satan is often permitted to play an after Game, and Error and Delusion spring up, and be∣come rampant. The divine Influences are in a Measure suspended, and the Lord's People in general abate of the Vigour of a Spiritual Life, and some die. Very soon rises up a Gene∣ration that knows not God, and abounds in Wickedness. The Co-incedence of some, e∣specially of all, these <HI>Things,</HI> rightly consider'd, may be of Use to account for the Appearance of the strange darkening and obscuring of the Glory of the Lord's Work, soon after there has been a great Revival of Religion. Even the Lord's People, when they do not make proper Allowence for these Things, withold from him, the due Tribute of his Praise, for the Work of his marvellous Grace. When these <HI>Things</HI> occur, they who truely fear God, are grieved, tried, and in the Issue established.
<PB N="82" REF="010250_0099_0F7E25C4CAC51868"/>
Many others stumble and fall, determine a∣gainst experimental Religion, and conclude to do as well as they can, and to rely upon unregenerate Morality, as the best Way to Heaven, and discern not their proper <HI>Motto,</HI> "Mene Tekal." Others speak reproachfully, and even blaspheme: With harden'd Hearts they cry, "Ah, so would we have it"! No doubt the Lord permits these Things, for Trials to his People; and in awful Judgment to those who would not bow before, nor ac∣knowledge Him in the Work of his Grace. If People would carefully attend to what the holy Scriptures teach us to expect, their Sur∣prize, Stumbling, and Reproach in all such Cases would cease. "For it must needs be that Offences must come: They who are approved must be made manifest. Though there are many Counterfeits, there will still be sufficient Means to distinguish in a Judgment of Charity, the Gold from the Dross. While the Faith of some is tried, and the Infidelity of others confirm'd, <HI>Aaron'</HI>s <HI>Rod</HI> will be swallowing up every other: Great is the Truth and it will at last prevail with eternal Triumph: The <HI>Stone</HI> from the Mountain, shall smite the <HI>Image</HI> from <HI>Head</HI> to <HI>Feet,</HI> and fill the whole <HI>Earth:</HI> As preparatory, "Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried: But the Wicked shall do wickedly: And none of the wicked shall
<PB N="83" REF="010250_0100_0F7E25C5AE659BF8"/>
understand; but the wise shall understand." The mournful Offences just now mentioned, take not Place as yet, among the professed Subjects of the Lord's Work <HI>here.</HI> I can't say there has been no Shadow of an Instance in any Person's Conduct, that hath given just Occasion of stumbling to others; nor do I flatter myself there will be none strange if not Many; but at present, Instances of moral Scandal we have not among us. God as yet hath graciously preserved the Subjects of this Work from giving Occasion of Scandal to the World. I have still the Pleasure of pro∣ceeding in preaching the great and glorious Truths of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> without diverting to correct Errors that have arisen in this Day. And indeed as <HI>Luther</HI> upon Occasion, said to <HI>Melancthon</HI> "the best way to beat down Error, was to preach up Truth;" so I believe 'tis the best Way to keep it out. We have here no Divisions and Contentions about Religion, all is Harmony, all is Love. Some Christians are hoping, that <HI>Zion</HI> shall no more be termed forsaken and desolate; but shall be called <HI>Hephzi-bah,</HI> and our Land <HI>Beulah:</HI> And seem determin'd to pray that the Lord would continue and increase the divine Influences 'till the latter Day Glory comes. Infinitely unworthy as we are, if we may judge by <HI>Fruits,</HI> as well as Feelings, we have
<PB N="84" REF="010250_0101_0F7E25C6507A1038"/>
most satisfactory, and Comfortable Evidence, that the great JEHOVAH has bowed his Heavens and come down to us, here on this End of our <HI>Island:</HI> Manifests his Glory to us, and dwells with us; and to Him be all the Glory and Praise for ever.</P>
<P>While I have been seeking and labouring to promote this blessed Work, I have been continually watchfull, left Satan, (as has been common) should gain some Advantage against it. I have looked for his Attempts, in his old beaten Paths, and also to have him make some new Attack. After all Precautions and Endeavours to have the Lord's Work preserved as free as possible, from Imaginary Notions, corrupt Mixtures, awful Degeneracy, and satanical Delusion, "Except the Lord keep the City, the Watchman waketh in vain." We the Ministers of Christ, who have seen a Time, or Times, of the Out-pouring of the Holy Spirit heretofore, and have observed past <HI>Scenes</HI> that have open'd to View, and now see the Lord's Work making Progress among our People, are reaping much Advantage by <HI>past Times.</HI> But after all, we find our selves vastly insufficient for our Work in this glo∣rious Day: We see that we greatly need Heavenly Furniture, much Wisdom and Pru∣dence, divine Aid, Assistance and Zeal, to be
<PB N="85" REF="010250_0102_0F7E25C8AD36D828"/>
denied from the immense Fulness and un∣wasted Stores of our all-sufficient <HI>Immanuel,</HI> in order to Fidelity, and full Proof of our Mininistry, in this marvellous Day of divine Influence.</P>
<P>To conclude, I would bespeak the Praises, and request the Prayers of the Lord's Peo∣ple, with Reference to his Work among us, and in behalf of Minister and People in this <HI>Town.</HI> Let <HI>them</HI> praise the <HI>triune God,</HI> for astonishing Manifestations of Almighty Power, and sovereign Grace among us! Let <HI>them</HI> pray hard, for God's gracious Presence with us, that our Light may so shine, that <HI>Himself</HI> may receive Glory We are far from being such a pure and holy People, as we ought to be; we are indeed a very sinful and wicked People, greatly needing a more thorough Reformation. 'Tis to be fear'd, that many are left as yet, under the Curse, in the Day of Blessing; in Dark∣ness, in this Day of Light; in Slavery, in the Year of <HI>Jubilee;</HI> Famishing in the midst of a Plenty of the Water of Life, and the heavenly <HI>Manna;</HI> Bleeding to Death, with many grievous Wounds, while the great Physician is present with the Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> and offers to heal and save, but they refuse as exposed to the most aggravated,
<PB N="86" REF="010250_0103_0F7E25C9C2FC30D0"/>
as well as an eternal Condemnation; surely their Case calls aloud for the Compassion and Prayers of all God's People. As to those of us, that hope we have received the Grace of God, after all that He hath wrought for us, we co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> exceedingly short of being such a holy, heavenly, humble, self-denied, fruitful, and thankful Peo∣ple, as we ought to be. We are not as yet half awaken'd to a Sense of our Duties and Privileges as Christians. We have but little Knowledge of the Glory and Beauty of the spotless Holiness, the perfect Excellence, and infi∣nite Amiableness of the divine Nature; and but little of that entire Approbation of every Thing in God, his Law and Dispensations, as perfectly right and absolutely Faultless: but little Knowledge of our own infinite Vile∣ness; and of the Divine Mediator's Glories, Worthyness, and Fullness, compar'd with what we ought to have. We have but little supreme Love to delight in, and devoted∣ness, to an infinite holy God, and a blessed Redeemer, to what we ought. We know but Little about the Opera∣tions of the Holy Spirit, the Blessedness of Communion with the adorable <HI>Trinity,</HI> and the infinite Excellence, and everlasting Importance of divine Things, compared with what we ought: We beg the Prayers of God's People, that He would yet more abundently Pour-out his Holy Spirit upon us. I would in particular, humbly be∣seech the People of God, to help me Praise Him, for upholding and carrying of me thro' a Series of suprising Labours in this Day: That in the distant Prospect, would have been thought too mighty, for any Man to have gone thro' and survived. I request the Prayers of the Lord's People, that I might give all Glory to God; be upheld by his <HI>free Spirit,</HI> be fully brought into, kept truely in, and under, the evangelical Spirit of this glorious Work.—And may the Lord's People, by Faith and every Grace, antecipate the Light, Purity, and Felicity of that glorious Day, when the Light of the <HI>Moon,</HI> shall be as the Light of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> seven fold! Mean while what I have written, I leave as a grateful

Publick <HI>Testimony</HI> of the memorable <HI>Work</HI> of the divine <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> among <HI>us</HI> in my Day which my Eyes have seen, and my Ears have heard with Pleasure that God, the <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> may have the more ex∣ensive Praise, to whose Blessing I consign it; and that others thereby may receive eternal Benefit.</P>
