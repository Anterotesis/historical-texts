<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here being too too many filthy Dreamers crept in a∣mong us, who by their filthy Dreams Blaspheme that worthy Name whereby we are called, renouncing that One Holy, Blessed and Eternal God in three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into whose Name we are Baptized; and that one only Mediator between God and Man, that Man <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and the whole Do∣ctrine of divine efficiency both in the decree, particularly Election and Rebrobation, and the execution thereof in the fall and restitu∣tion in Redemption, and the application thereof, and so denying the resurrection and the last judgement, together with the authority of the holy Scriptures, yea, under the sacred words, <HI>Repent, Repent,</HI> calling upon men to renounce and deny all their Religion, and the profession and practise thereof, saying (as <HI>Edward Burrows</HI> in his Preface to <HI>George Foxes</HI> Mystery) that they have sufficient cause to cry against us, and to deny our ministry, our Church, our Wor∣ship, and our whole Religion: And some of them (called and known by the name of <HI>Quakers</HI>) under the pretence of the light within them, and of the Spirit as their only Rule, having (even of their <HI>Women</HI>) been acted in a most beastly, shameful and horrid manner among us, against the very light of nature, and the common dictates of modesty, especially in that Sex, so as to go openly, and wholy na∣ked, in the day time, in some of our most frequented streets, and of our publick Assemblies. Another of them to transform her self into a deformed shape, as 'twere of the Devil, unto not only the di∣sturbance and affrighting of others in the solemn Assembly for Wor∣ship, but to the hazarding thereby the lives of divers Women with Childe, together with the fruit of the Womb, as hapned on the Lords day in <HI>Boston</HI> on the <HI>8th.</HI> of this month, (beside other practical a∣bominations which their Principles lead them to.)</P>
<P>It was judged meet to set before you in Print that solemn, serious and seasonable Testimony, which was given by that holy, prayerfull and prevailing Man of God, that sometimes faithful, prudent, and watchful Pastor of that eminent Church of Christ, which was the first in <HI>Boston,</HI> that now blessed <HI>John Wilson</HI> by name, which was Preached by him in his last Lecture Sermon in the said Church on

<HEAD>Jer. <HI>29, 8.</HI> For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, let not your Pro∣phets, and your Diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your Dreames, which ye cause to be dreamed.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a strange thing (my Brethren) that the Lord should speak in this manner to his people, or that there should be such a thing found among them; for he speaks to the Rulers, and to the old men, &amp;c. and he saith that they had caused these things to be spoken, that are Dreams, and the Lord doth give warning to them, that they should not hearken to these Dreams: what the people of God that profess his holy name? will they have an hand in this woker to have Dreams spoken▪ and to have Dreamers come, that shall be instrumental of the damnation of the souls of men? but it is so sometimes, that there are those that will compell others to these things: as <HI>I</HI> remember there were those that came to <HI>Aa∣ron,</HI> and would have a Calf made, &amp;c. and I remember there was one that came to the Prophet <HI>Micaiah,</HI> and told him of these and those Prophets that did declare good to the King with one mouth: and let thy word be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good: but they were a company of
<PB N="2" REF="000243_0005_0FA36E7B88DEFB18"/>
Dreamers: and <HI>Ahab</HI> doth not love <HI>Micaiah</HI>: and he doth never speak a good word to me, wherefore <HI>I</HI> hate him: and the messenger that goes to him tells him that there were so many hundreds of them that do speak pleasing things to the King, and I pray thee do thou speak such like things to him, that may be matter of contentment to him; but that Prophet of the Lord would not turn to the right hand, or to the left, for the King, or for any other; but what God did put into his mouth, that he would speak: and so it is generally, that when the false Prophet doth arise among the People of God, it is because of Gods people that are the cause of it: and it is they that do set them up, and maintain them, and would have pillows laid under their elbows: and why is it so? why (my Brethren) even since it was that <HI>Eve</HI> did hearken to the voice of the Serpent: And also the children of God are much given to novelties; these are things that they never heard of before: and if they may have these and those things spoken which they never heard of before, this is all many care for, though they are such things as came not out of the mouth of God: yet because they are new things, and that please their humors, therefore they affect them: thus the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> one would think an Apostle good enough; yet there were many that were unsatisfied with him, as in the Epistle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> we read, <HI>&amp; bewitched with the false Tea∣chers</HI>; these give us (say they) the Gospel in this and that way, &amp;c. however they did once look at the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> as an Angel of God, even as Christ Iesus: but now the case was altered: and now <HI>Paul</HI> was no body: and come of him what would, he might starve for all them: they were carried away after those that vented their new things.</P>
<P>Again the word of the Lord doth come with marvelous great power, and might, when it is dispensed as it should be and ac∣companied with the holy Spirit of God: and men cannot go on so pleasingly and quietly in their sinful wayes, &amp;c. but these Prophets of God are ready to be upon their backs, and sit upon their sk<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts, &amp; tell them their own &amp;c. Again another rea∣son is because the people of God, that live under the word of God where God is stretching forth his hands all the day long, are
<PB N="3" REF="000243_0006_0FA36E7C47DFEE20"/>
(through corruption in them) even weary of the things of God, &amp; that because divers of them have not received the truth of God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the love of it, for if they had received the truth in the love of it, then they would abide still in that love of the truth, and would not account any thing too good for the faithful Ministers of God: But there are Hypocrites that come into the Church, and sit in the same Pews, and seem to be very attentive, and sometimes speak such a word as this [<HI>A brave Sermon</HI>] and [<HI>a fine Ser∣mon! a gallant Sermon it was that we heard to day</HI>! &amp;c.] but yet they never subjected themselves indeed to the truth of God: and will not part with their lusts which they foster in their own bosoms: and if they love not the truth, there is something else which they love surely; and indeed it is lies: even as our Lord and Saviour Christ saith in the 5<HI>th</HI> of <HI>John, I am come in my Fa∣thers Name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive</HI>: and him they shall receive, though it should be in the Devils name: and now it is just for God him∣self to give them over to the believing of lies, and to strong delu∣sions, and if there be one delusion more strong then another, and more abominable then another, yet it will go down with them; as they that would have <HI>Barrabbas</HI> rather then Christ, so it is with these that would not have the truth, nor did receive it in the love of it. The Devil himself of Hell cannot propose to them a lye more abominable then other, but they will receive the same, and God is just in this Judgement upon them for dallying with his truth: and for their not receiving of it; Satan is an enemy to God, and an enemy to the truth: and when the Corn was sown in the field, then that enemy comes, and he sows his Tares: he hath a great hand in stirring up such men as these, and puts these Dreams into their heads, and he will set up his Kingdome to pull down the blessed Kingdome of the Lord Jesus Christ thereby: and he will have his Ministers, and he will have decei∣vers (transforming himself into an Angel of light) and he will come in the Name of God, and in the name of Christ also even as the vagabond Jews <HI>Act.</HI> 19. and the sons of <HI>Sceva</HI> are said to do so. There is nothing that the true Prophets do, but he will by turning himself into an Angel of light do the like. The
<PB N="4" REF="000243_0007_0FA36E7D07EBC560"/>
Devil spake that truth, as it may be questioned whether there can be a better truth spoken concerning Jesus Christ, <HI>i. e. thou art the holy One of God</HI>: and so the Damosel, we know, that said these men are the Servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation: could you have spoken better words than these? but that was only to make way for the bring∣ing forth other things, that are in the pack, &amp;c. Now saith the Lord <HI>do not you hearken to these Dreamers</HI>: it is a very lamen∣table thing to see that any such Dreamers should arise, as <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> and <HI>Ranters,</HI> and these and those that trouble the Churches of God: but whom may we thank for it? even Gods People: in our Text God here saith, <HI>you have caused these Dreamers thus to speak their Dreams,</HI> i. e. by setting them up, or countenan∣cing them: &amp; by not testifying against them: God would have us seek to the Prophets, but it is to those that indeed come in his Name, and are sent by him: and if we do despise his Servants, we despise him: but as when those that did adjure by Jesus, whom <HI>Paul</HI> Preached; it was said to them, <HI>who are you</HI>? so may the Lord say, these and those that are sent in my Name I know, but as for you (these or those) <HI>who are you?</HI> But alas, if God leave People to themselves, what will they not come unto! This is one reason of it also, namely, because People are ready to fol∣low a multitude: do you not see how <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and like them very well: and for your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> what are they? and, as <HI>Corah</HI> and his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as well as you: and we can offer Incense as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you: and Baptize as well as you, &amp;c. yea, but Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, you shall know them by their fruits: but thus are they c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng down, and crying out against the faithful Ministers of God: and if we look into this Chapter, see what they say: is there not <HI>Jeremiah</HI> that maketh himself a Prophet? whereas it was not Man, but God that made him a Prophet: alas poor man! he would have been glad to have been out of the work, but that God did call him to that work: but they had rather have some other than <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to be the Prophet. These Ministers, what are these Ministers: but if you would go to such a manner of Meeting, and hear what things are spoken there, you would like others
<PB N="5" REF="000243_0008_0FA36E7DC8CD8E28"/>
better then your Minister: and so are men ready to cry up these as the great power of God, as was of him said, <HI>Act. 8.</HI> thus 'tis here; but <HI>I</HI> beseech you (my Brethren) if men will cast off the Lord, and his Ordinances, and follow their own humours, let them alone, as <HI>Mat. 15. they are blind leaders of the blind</HI>; but yet notwithstanding the Lord hath pitty upon his poor people when he sees them thus taken in the net, and the Lord comes in now to give them warning: O do not hearken to these Dreamers, but hearken to the holy Word of God, even as in the Psalm now sung, <HI>Psal. 119. The Word, the Word, the Word (and the Statutes, the Statutes, the Statutes of God,</HI> and the <HI>Ordinances of God,</HI> &amp;c. Oh these are the things which we are to observe: one word from the Lord is to be preferred before all other matters. You may think it a strange thing that thus they should speak against the faithful Ministers of God, but thus it hath been with the Prophets of old, yea, and with our Saviour Jesus Christ himself, who did not preach as the Scribes did, but with authority, and it was spoken of him, that God would raise up a Prophet like to <HI>Moses,</HI> &amp;c. but yet when he comes into his Ministry, to draw all men to the faith and obedi∣ence of his holy name: yet (He, O they would have made a King of him, when as he did so wonderfully feed them: and never man spake as he! &amp;c. but) afterward what was our Lord Jesus in their account? even a <HI>Wine-bibber</HI> and a <HI>Glutton,</HI> and a <HI>man that did practise with the Devil himself,</HI> even with <HI>Belzebub</HI> himself: thus did they speak against our Saviour Jesus Christ: and yet Christ did labour among them, and gave them many war∣nings: Wo be to <HI>Corazin</HI>: and wo be to thee <HI>Bethsaida</HI>: and wo be to these, and wo be to those: but at length they came to that to cry up <HI>Barrabbas</HI> before him: yet Christ did not leave giving warning, <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, I would have gathered thee as an hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings</HI>: and he did weep over them; that they would not know the things of their peace: and that though he came to them, yet they (even his own) did not receive him; but were weary of his Ministry▪ and the <HI>Romans</HI> (say they) will come and destroy us: they thought it would be their utter undoing, whereas indeed that was the
<PB N="6" REF="000243_0009_0FA36E7E871FAB60"/>
cause of their overthrow that they did reject him: yet still our Saviour Jesus Christ goes on to preach to them: and so it is in our dayes: and there be those that go about, and give it out, as though they were Christ: and how many are ready to hearken to such: but consider, what came you into this Wilderness for? did you come to gaze upon one another? &amp;c. no, you came to see, and hear that great Prophet, even the Lord Jesus in his Mi∣nisters, that you might have the Ordinances of God in his Chur∣ches rightly gathered, and the holy Sacraments rightly admini∣stred: I trow you did not come hither for the World, to scrape the World: much less to put your necks under these and those that would overturn all order among you: but O foolish <HI>Gala∣tians, who hath bewitched you</HI>? you come hither to hear the bles∣sed voice of Jesus Christ, and you did make account that when you came hither, O how holy should you be; &amp;c and we came not to separate from the Churches in <HI>Old England</HI> (God forbid) but we did indeed only separate from the polutions there: but alas, <HI>who hath bewitched you</HI>? that there should be any found to leave the blessed Ordinances of God, and to follow these and those: and if he be a new one, and have new things to teach them, that is enough to many: but the word of God will not spa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any in their sin: nor let men sleep quietly in their sin: will not let the Drunkard alone, nor the Swearer alone, &amp;c. but these Dreamers have their soft Pillows to place under mens Elbows, that they may not be hurt by leaning thereon: but see here the mercy of God that would not have men let alone, and run to hell in such way of their Dreams: <HI>O do not this abominable thing that my soul hates</HI>! and did not the Lord give warning to <HI>Korah</HI> and his company? and so to the People, that they might not follow them? but away, away, save your souls, and come not near them if you love your lives, if you love your souls come not near to those men, but hearken to the voice of God; so here, &amp;c. And therefore hearken not to the Dreamers, and Dreams which you have caused them to Dream: but if you have been deluded come out from those delusions; if by your connivances, or entertainments, and the like, we have encouraged such Dreamers, O continue no longer so to do: And if these would
<PB N="7" REF="000243_0010_0FA36E7F473C0D00"/>
not (in our Text) be perswaded from hearkening to those Dreamers, yet I here come in the name of the Lord Jesus to you to give you warning: O hearken not to these and those Dream∣ers; God will tell you one day you had your <HI>Cotton</HI> and your <HI>Norton,</HI> and your <HI>Hooker,</HI> and your <HI>Shepard,</HI> and your <HI>Rogers,</HI> and these and those, you had my Ministers, and there is never a Minister that God hath sent, but the time will come, when as, if you have heard them, and obeyed them, O what a sweet meet∣ing will that be, and then may they say, Lord, here we are, and the Children that thou hast given us, &amp;c. But otherwise God will say, why did you not receive them? when they come to de∣spise the Prophets of the Lord, were it but the least of the holy Prophets and Messengers of the Lord, the wrath of the Lord rose against his People, so that there was no remedy: hearken not therefore to these or those Dreams or Dreamers, but stop your ears against them: as the Adder that keeps her self from be∣ing charmed, she is said to stop her ear with the ground on which she lyeth, and the other ear with some other part of her body; so in this case stop your ears against them, and take heed in this case: else Conscience will fly in your faces another day, and say I told you of it, and <HI>I</HI> checked you for it, and you would not re∣gard. But therefore hearken to those that do in a right manner speak to you the word of God, that are fitted for it, and are cal∣led of God to that work of the Ministry: hearken to these; And have you not (many of you) been converted by the Mi∣nisters of God? and have you not been comforted by them ma∣ny a time? &amp;c. and will you now cast off the Lord, and his servants? O to day, while it is called to day, hearken to the Lords voice; the Lord is yet willing to receive you, and to pro∣tect you; but if you hearken to these Dreamers, God will turn to be your Enemy: and will testifie against such, as against <HI>Ahab,</HI> and <HI>Zedechiah</HI> spoken of in the Chapter where our text is, that were left to commit villany in Israel, even to commit A∣dultery with their Neighbours Wives (and that is the fruit of these and those Sects, and Errors, that such shall be left to com∣mit such like uncleanness) and the King roasted these Dreamers in the fire, as one would roast an hog: and this did become a
<PB N="8" REF="000243_0011_0FA36E800985F918"/>
Proverb, <HI>The Lord make thee like Zedechiah and like Ahab, &amp;c.</HI> And so I say, mark what will come on such like Dreamers: and so saith the Apostle, mark those that do cause divisions, and of∣fences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and a∣void them: mark them so as to avoid them, and mark the course that the Lord will take with them, and with those that will fol∣low after them. There are many Dreamers in these times, the Quaker hath his Dreams, and the Seeker hath his Dreams, and I cannot reckon up all of them: and one Dream doth be get ano∣ther, but the Lord doth testifie against them all: and the Lord calls them bad Figs, none so bad as those Figs were that did thus despise the Lords Prophets and Messengers, or Ministers: the Dreamers would take you off from them, but I beseech you that you would not hearken to those Dreamers, but hearken to the voice of the Lord by his Ministers in their speeches, in their writings, I have known <HI>New-England</HI> about thirty six years, and I never knew such a time as this is that we live in: you came hither for your Children, Sons and Daughters, and for your Grand-children to be under the Ordinances of God, that they might be as Plants in the Lords house, was not this a great end in your coming hither? now if you love your selves, your Fami∣lies, your Children, if you love God, if you love Christ, if you love Heaven, then hearken not to Dreamers, nor cause them to Dream that would corrupt the People of God, and that would take them off from the holy and blessed will of God in these things: you would not suffer any to come and rob you of your Money, or your Jewels, &amp;c. would you let them come into your Houses, and take them away by force from you? no, you would thrust them away, and what have you to do here? O much more so, when they come to rob you of the Ordinances of God, and of his faithful Ministers; this is as much as in them lies to take away our God from us, and communion with him: go serve o∣ther Gods, said <HI>Saul,</HI> by his acting, in his thrusting poor <HI>David</HI> away from the Ordinances of God: and so the two Tribes and a half were very careful about their Children, that it might not be said to them, what have you to do with the Lord God of Is∣rael? and you have no part in the Lord, and so their Children
<PB N="9" REF="000243_0012_0FA36E80C71F7C80"/>
should be made to cease from fearing the Lord: and when they saw any thing that did look like a new Religion, and like a su∣perstition, now the people of God arm themselves, and let us go every one, and suppress and destroy those that would be the Au∣thors thereof, unless they did repent: and what do they say? the Lord God of Gods, he knoweth this and that: what! go and set up an Altar against Gods Altar! O wretches that we were if so we should do, but we were afraid lest in time to come your Children might speak unto our Children saying, what have you to do with the Lord God of Israel? and therefore that Altar was only a memorial that we and our Children are in the Cove∣nant of God: so it should be; we are to be zealous for God, and zealous for his Ordinances, that we our selves may injoy them, and also our Children after us, and that none might thrust them from their part in the Lord, and from their enjoy∣ment of the Ordinances of God. We are afraid sometimes of Turk, or Pope, or these and those: be you afraid of nothing, but as our Lord &amp; Saviour Christ saith, I will tell you whom you shall fear: do not fear men that kill the body, but fear him that can kill the soul: and love the Lord, fear God, and honour the King, that is the duty of every good Christian: above all fear and o∣bey the Lord: hearken to the good word of God, that is able to save your souls, and build you up, and give you an inheritance a∣mong them that shall be saved: that when the Lord Jesus shall come in flaming fire, he may have nothing to say against you, but may say to you <HI>come ye blessed inherit the Kingdome prepa∣red for you,</HI> and here is life and death set before you: <HI>New-England,</HI> here is life and death set before thee; choose which you will: Let the Governour choose which he will, let the Church of Boston choose which they will, let us all choose life, and choose to serve the Lord, we and our Houses as <HI>Joshua,</HI> and then God will be with us: and if God be with us, who is there that can be against us to hurt us? and so be for God, as to live to God, and to be willing to dy for him also if he call us to it: O be willing to submit to his will, that we may be able to kiss the stake, and the fagot if the Lord call us to it; There is no King in the World that hath such a Crown as that would be: we are

to cast up our reckoning before hand (as <HI>John Frith</HI> did) what it may cost us to be for, and to serve the Lord? trust not in men, trust not in the Governour, trust not in the Magistrates: trust not in your Captains, trust not in your Castle, or Amunition, trust not in your own righteousness; but trust in this, that if the Lord be your God, and if you walk worthy of the Lord unto all plea∣sing, that he will be with you: and say as the holy Prophet <HI>Da∣vid; Here we are Lord, and thou knowest that we came hither to shroud our selves, and our Children under thy wings, and leave our witness behind us when we are dead: but here we are, and do to us even as is good in thine eyes</HI>: and yet as he said, who knoweth but we shall finde mercy in his sight; but then walk as <HI>David</HI> did: that though not afraid of the Lyon or Bear; or of ten thousand of his Enemies, yet he flies from his Son: and then what did he? truly he went bare-headed by the ascent of <HI>Mount Olivet,</HI> weeping as he went: and Kingdome or no Kingdome, he left that to God; but there prayeth to God, and that was a Prayer against <HI>Ahitophel [Lord curse the counsel of Ahitophel]</HI> and God did hear him, and restore him to his House, and King∣dome, and Glory again: so let us all pray, and repent; Gover∣nour repent, Magistrates repent, Ministers repent, People even all repent, young and old repent, and then it shall go well with us.</P>
