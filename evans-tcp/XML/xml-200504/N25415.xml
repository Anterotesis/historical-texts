<HEAD>ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IF we take a comprehensive view of the order of nature, we find that man possesses a distinguished rank in the great scale of beings—his mind is capacious, and fitted for rational enquiries: hence his researches contribute to the happiness of society, and redound to the glory of GOD.</P>
<P>IN examining the annals of the world, we find revolutions in almost every page: the principles implanted in our breasts, impel us <HI>forward,</HI> and stimulate us to be continually forming new projects to gratify our selflove, which, when uncontrol∣ed by reason, produces disorder and tumult. When socie∣ties were young, each Patriarch sat judge of his own hous∣hold; each one contributed his share to the general good, and each was rewarded according to his merit—all was order and harmony, the horrors of war had not then deformed the moral picture, nor had tyranny rear'd her baleful head to curse the Sons of GOD—in that golden age we see man hap∣py—but the scene is soon reversed:—Some one, prompted by ambition and assisted by intrigue, gained a conquest over his fellows, and they were compelled to acknowledge "the enormous faith of <HI>many</HI> made for <HI>one</HI>;" which is repugnant to the eternal laws of nature, and the dictates of reason — [Man, when possessed of absolute power, is generally puffed up with pride; and the passions assume the reins of govern∣ment—being flattered by his courtiers, he thinks himself in∣fallible, and is determined to have implicit obedience to his commands.]—The world then first began to feel the scourge of despotism—the father bemoaned the death of his son, and the fond mother the unhappy fate of her daughter, torn from her bosom by the imperious command of a licentious des∣pot: for, in arbitrary governments, how often have thousands fallen victims to the whim of a favorite, the capricious cru∣elty of a consort, and even to the smiles of an abandoned prostitute! But the sparks of Liberty, though they may be smothered for a season, yet they cannot be extinguished. We behold the firm patriot, the father of his country, arise to avenge his slaughtered brethren; we behold the tyrant roll∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="033732_0004_0FF8F02505AFBFE0"/>
in the dust, and biting the ground for remorse and an∣guish—and Liberty once more triumphant.</P>
<P>AMONG those various revolutions, which have astonished the world in all ages, there is no one which exceeds the rev∣olution in <HI>America</HI>; if we consider the greatness of the cause, the characters exhibited in the contest, or the event which ensued. The emancipation of four millions of people from the yoke of tyranny, the prudent, wise and steady conduct of the American Congress, the martial toils of our brethren, and the glorious termination of a long and arduous conflict, stand unexampled in the annals of mankind. To perpetuate the remembrance of this grand scene, through the long tracts of future time, in anniversary commemorations, must be de∣lightful to the enlightened posterity of heroes. As it has been the custom of all nations (even the most barbarous) to celebrate their warlike atchievments, and commit them un∣impaired from father to son, surely Americans will not hesi∣tate to engage in a work of such dignified feelings, as the cel∣ebration of the birth day of their liberties, and which has so much in view the happiness of succeeding generations: then let our imaginations give full force to the generous impres∣sion, and expand on the wings of benevolence and philan∣thropy; and as this day is recorded by the registering angel above, as one of the brightest days of humanity. so let it be held by us in everlasting remembrance. I should feel much reluctance in speaking on this important occasion, (well knowing my inability to do honor to the day) were I not sensible, that Liberty, established on the broad basis of In∣dependence and the virtues of the People, needs not the aid of rhetoric to enhance her value, nor fine-turn'd periods to exalt her worth. Those who are alive to the feelings of humanity and to the electric name of Liberty, must feel in∣finitely more pleasure in the words WE ARE FREE, uttered by the tongue of <HI>simple truth,</HI> than that a DEMOSTHENES or a CICERO▪ assisted by all the powers of eloquence and de∣scription, should pronounce them <HI>slaves.</HI> Liberty needs no arguments to prove her beauty, or to convince mankind of her worth; she offers herself unadorned, and is accepted, in∣stead of slavery in chains of gold—<HI>I am Free!</HI> what sounds more acceptable could be uttered by the tongue, even of an Angel of Light. All our eloquence is contained in them; nor can the mind of man conceive of an expression better
<PB N="5" REF="033732_0005_0FF8F028E32442F8"/>
adapted to the genius of an AMERICAN—Therefore, (as it is my part this day to lead in the celebration of that event which severed us from the control of <HI>Albion,</HI> and gave us a rank among nations) I must beg your patience and candid con∣sideration to be exercised towards the speaker, who, indeed, wishes for the presence of a CICERO, to do honor to a day so memorable, and to this venerable and respectable audi∣ence before whom he is called to speak.</P>
<P>THE calm which succeeds hurry and confusion, seems to be the season most proper for meditation; and if we behold ourselves in affluent circumstances, we are naturally led back to contemplate the first cause of the events which we expe∣rience: It is thus the mariner, having escaped the ravages of the sea, seats himself on the beach, and with calmness views the beating surge, the regular succession of the waves, and recollects that lucid star, which guided him safe through storms and tempests, and restored him to his country, to his family and friends. No nation on the globe can trace their origin, and the time they became a people, with so great precision as <HI>America.</HI> According to history, other existing nations and kingdoms have, by slow and almost impercepti∣ble degrees, advanced toward refinement; after revolutions and counter-revolutions, the maturing hand of TIME has brought them to that degree of consistency which they now enjoy;—while <HI>America,</HI> in less than two centuries, has be∣come a great and powerful nation. Eventful indeed has been the period; neither history nor fiction, can produce a parallel! Less than two hundred years ago, our fathers sought in this country (then the haunt of the prowling beast, and solitary savage) an asylum from their woes and persecu∣tions—with unremitting labor, and through innumerable hardships, they procured this glorious patrimony for us— which▪ as we have once defended it from the encroachments of a powerful and haughty nation, we are determined never to have taken from us.</P>
<P>AS this is an age of reason, in which all vulgar prejudices should be discarded, and as tis dishonorable to insult the fal∣len, no one will expect to hear the language of invective against <HI>Greatbritain;</HI> and since our measures have been crowned with complete success, and we are now on an ami∣cable and equal footing with that nation, let us forbear such complainings as might befit a conquered people, who could
<PB N="6" REF="033732_0006_0FF8F02D4CC224D0"/>
effect nothing, but was forced to be content with the poor consolation of execrating and uttering obloquy against their usurpers. America, my friends, abounding in all the bless∣ings of nature, a fertile clime, and wisdom and education sufficient to frame good forms of government, wanted noth∣ing▪ but the infernal machinations of NORTH, and the op∣pressive measures of the tyrant of <HI>Albion,</HI> to rouse her to throw off her yoke, to assert her Rights, and "press her fortunes to a destination." And from that day, in which the blood of our citizens flowed through our streets in rivers, and the cursed emissaries of slaughter threatened to lay waste our land▪ we may begin to date our importance; for then was it that the American Congress, (wearied with <HI>petitioning</HI> for a redress of grievances) pronounced that famous declaration of Independence, which has arrested the attention, and com∣manded the admiration of every nation and people under heaven. Yes, Citizens, it was on the memorable Fourth of July, 1776, (22 years ago this day) that the Genius of <HI>Amer∣ica</HI> assumed a glorious countenance; Liberty erected her standard in this country; the people flocked to it in crouds, enlisted under her banner, and swore to live and die with her.—Though the dagger was held to our throats ere we thought of resistance, though we had to contend with the most powerful nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> assisted by the mercenary Hessian, and the fierce biped of the wilderness; though un∣taught in tactics and military discipline, and destitute of re∣sources, yet nought could damp the ardor of <HI>Columbia</HI>'s sons, whose souls were firm and determined, and whose breasts glowed with a generous love of Liberty. As the efforts of our countrymen were great, the event was glorious: <HI>Britain</HI> acknowledged our Independence, the world wondered, and <HI>America</HI> became a NATION. In all dangers, the GOD of Heaven was nigh, and turned the machinations of tyrants to our benefit; even the war, in which we expended so much property▪ and lost so many lives, was necessary, and in the end proved to us, a blessing:—it was a necessary school for our Soldiers and Statesmen; it showed to us our own con∣sequence in the scale; it united us; it taught us the value of the blessings of Liberty and Peace; and, in short, it was nec∣essary to our existence as a nation. Should this retrospective view, bring to the remembrance of any present, the death of a son, father, or brother, slain in the defence of his country,
<PB N="7" REF="033732_0007_0FF8F03318579CF8"/>
and cause them to shed the tear of nature, for their loss; let such remember, that they fell in a glorious cause, the cause of Liberty and Independence;—and though their remains now lie unburied on a distant land, exposed to the ravages of hungry wolves, and screaming ravens; though no friend was nigh to close their dying eyes; yet the tears of Angels were shed to bathe their unburied limbs; nor shall time obliterate from the breasts of posterity, the remembrance of their pat∣riotism, nor the trump of fame ever cease to sound their praise.—Though the rivers, hills, and dales, (which were the scenes of slaughter in the late war) now reverberate the groans of butchered citizens; and though <HI>Concord, Bunker's-Hill, Monmouth,</HI> and those towns ravaged by the stern God of War, obtrude themselves on our imaginations; yet, if pos∣sible, let recollection, the faithful monitor of past sufferings, retire behind the curtain of oblivion, nor damp the joys of this festive day with unavailing tears. Exercise is necessa∣ry: for man is enervated by sloth, and effeminated by con∣tinual prosperity—The toils, the sorrows of our countrymen, enabled them to enjoy their consequent good fortune with a better dignity;—and we find that those who have been most inured to hardships, those who have been exercised in the hard school of adversity, make the best of fathers, husbands and citizens. But if we view the day of carnage, without repining, surely our hearts ought to glow with gratitude to those Heroes, who fanned the flame of Freedom in <HI>America,</HI> who braved all dangers, and engaged in actual service in the field, for the Liberty and Rights of their country—among which venerable and truly respectable and honorable char∣acters, the name of WASHINGTON must hold the most distinguished rank in the bright catalogue, and be repeated with transports of gratitude, when the great Original lies cold beneath the turf. Fain would I frame an eulogy on this most illustrious character, but the powers of description fail me in the attempt, and oblige me to "let expressive silence muse his praise." This day, Citizens, we have distinguished as a JUBILEE—and believe me, we have great reason to re∣joice; to rejoice that we are Americans: for while we be∣hold other nations of the earth groaning under the hard yoke of tyranny, ignorance and superstition, and while we drop a tear on the miseries of the Asians and Africans, whose fer∣tile fields lie uncultivated, whose fruitage is buried in the
<PB N="8" REF="033732_0008_0FF8F037B3BB02F0"/>
furrows, and whose agriculture sleeps as in the cradle of cre∣ation, whose sons, under the lash of despotism, have become slaves, and dead to the feelings of humanity; and while <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> is bleeding at every vein, <HI>America</HI> (stretching from the equinoctial line to the arctic circle) boasts of a climate hav∣ing the salubriousness of the Frigid zone, with all the neces∣saries of the Temperate, and superfluities of the Torrid; a Constitution which secures to all their rights and liberties, and <HI>equally</HI> embraces all ranks of people, from the gown∣man vested with judicial authority, to the peasant who, with laborious toil, turns up the earth for a scanty subsistence.— No hereditary distinctions, cause obscure merit to wrestle with poverty, "the pride of fools, and man's insulting scorn" —the dignity of human nature is here asserted; no one is taught to shudder at the approach of his neighbor, though Fortune ("the changling deity of fools") may have assisted him in the accumulation of wealth, or exalted him in the scale of promotion; but Virtue and Integrity are made the criterion of esteem. The horrors of a prison assail not here the minds of the virtuous, nor does the father anticipate the wretched fate of being torn from the bosom of his family, and condemned to drag out a miserable existence in the gloomy depths of a dungeon—but peace, plenty, Liberty, education, order, and good government, are the happy char∣acteristics of Americans—Liberty inspires with noble senti∣ments, Education refines them; Security and Peace prompt us to fulfil all the social and moral duties of life;—Govern∣ment secures to us these inestimable blessings. Our excel∣lent constitution, citizens, as it is our greatest blessing, so it ought to be our greatest boast;—by ten years experience, <HI>America</HI> has evinced to the world, that an Elective Repub∣lican Government can exist; a truth, which the philosophers of old allowed to be beautiful in theory, but denied its re∣ducibility to practice—Splendid monument of the wisdom and moderation of my country! which has secured to us the esteem of the world.</P>
<P>IN literature and literary acquirements, we also hold a distinguished rank in the world; and from our excellent in∣stitutions, we cannot but anticipate the period when the American genius shall soar as high and produce as many shining lights, on the horizon of Science, as have been pro∣duced by any nation under heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033732_0009_0FF8F03B993F41C0"/>'TIS with regret, Citizens, that I divert your attention from these pleasing contemplations of our national happi∣ness, (the critical situation of our country obliges me) to re∣flect on the conduct of that haughty and profligate junto in <HI>France,</HI> called the Directory—and though it is not a pleasing task to anticipate adversity, yet it is at present very necessa∣ry; for too great security relaxes the springs of our minds, and lays us open to invasion: Then let a retrospect of the conduct of that haughty nation, inspire us with a noble in∣dignation and fortitude to oppose any measures which tend to the subversion of our rights and dear bought liberties.— Fain would I draw a veil over transactions so derogatory, not only to the honor of those who profess to be contending for liberty, but to human nature itself, as are exhibited by <HI>France;</HI> but they will not be hidden—they "flash convic∣tion" on those who are most infatuated, and they rouse the most torpid to indignation; even the sacred dust of those heroes who fought and bled for liberty, trembles in its urn. AMERICANS! what honor is it to you, that you are free from the control of <HI>Britain,</HI> if you are to be controled by <HI>France?</HI> or what does it profit, that you have once bled for your Lib∣erties, if they are to be given up at the demand of a foreign power? Is the name of <HI>America</HI> to be erased from the an∣nals of history, and the <HI>United States</HI> again become colonies? Immortal Gods! — [But this can never be.]— <HI>France</HI> has meddled in our government▪ has abused our gen∣erous friendship; she has broken the laws of nations, and ought to be considered by the people of this country as an enemy to their existence as a nation.—What an adder have we nourished in our bosoms! for when <HI>France</HI> first burst her chains, and engaged in a war with all <HI>Europe, America,</HI> with an ardor of friendship which evinced her good wishes to the cause of the Republic, immediately acknowledged her In∣dependence, and the whole country rang with thanksgivings and jubilee for her successes. But when we take a dispas∣sionate view of their conduct, (exhibiting in quick succession the ruthless barbarism of the savage, and the riot of intoxi∣cated success) we start back, with horror, from the precipice, into which we were about to be plunged, partly from motives of a too amiable hospitality, and an enthusiastic love of liber∣ty, and partly from the concealed conduct of her nefareous emissaries of false friendship. The Directory have aban∣doned
<PB N="10" REF="033732_0010_0FF8BF58824D2C20"/>
the cause in which <HI>France</HI> first engaged, and have de∣termined on Universal Domination; astride which hobby horse, they have lost sight of consistency; and having strip∣ped the pillars of their national character of their fairest in∣scriptions, have left them the dismantled monuments of an edifice, according to appearance, soon to be swallowed up in the Charybdis of anarchy. Their hostile treatment of <HI>America,</HI> (the only existing republic, and whose duration was essentially necessary to <HI>their</HI> existence) has completely filled up their measure of iniquity, and added to the history of their political blunders and national intrigues, the greatest, and we hope the last, instance of their detested and barbar∣ous policy. The first instance of her sororial affection which presents itself to our view, (as she was well read in the histo∣ry of Machiavilianism, and knew the advantage <HI>America</HI> would be to her in the prosecution of her designs, could she engage us in the contest) is her dispatching GENET to this country; whose artful and atrocious attempts, not only to engage us in the European war, but, when he could not well accomplish those designs, to subvert the constitution, deter∣mined government to have him recalled—as the measures of <HI>France</HI> were not yet ripe for the master stroke, that request was readily granted—His successor, FAUCHET, seems to have trodden the same steps with GENET, and "was only obliged to retire when the true nature of his mission was discovered in an intercepted letter;" so that it was left to ADET, the last French minister, to complete the edifice reared by his prede∣cessors, and put the finishing hand to this master-piece of in∣fernal machinations; the cup of iniquity, which was almost then drained, was left for this man to exhaust—which he has done to the lowest and foulest lees! GENET, ADET, FAU∣CHET—these are the <HI>immaculate</HI> ministers who have "felt the pulse" of every needy Senator, and if indignant virtue spurned the proffered bribe, have threatened us with the re∣sentment of the <HI>Terrible Republic</HI>—These are they, whose names, in a regular climax, so stand on the black volume of infamy, that the last has the <HI>honor</HI> of being a <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of audacity and impudence, on this side the infernal shades! The whole conduct of <HI>France,</HI> exhibited in our intercourse with that nation, evinces to us their real designs; which are by dividing the people from the government, to take away our liberties; and their plans, at one time, (it cannot be de∣nied)
<PB N="11" REF="033732_0011_0FF8F0182422CB20"/>
went on too well for the honor of this country—but thanks to our President, our Executive, and to our patriotic citizens, whose firmness obliged the avaricious Frenchman to throw off the mask too soon for the execution of their machi∣nations; we have escaped the snare which was laid for us. That black train of spies and seducers, who have all along supplied pabulum to those who have been in the French interest, have slunk away in hopeless dejection—and their spoliations on our commerce have caused those <HI>honest</HI> minds who, through a mistaken sympathy, were sinking with them in the vortex of anarchy, to rise "buoyant from the gulph," and to attach themselves to the real interests of their country. The spawn dropped by each retiring French minister, which had hatched, and increased beyond endurance, and which had infested every department, have almost all vanished away, or perished with the last struggles of <HI>France</HI> to disor∣ganize us—and if <HI>any</HI> now remain, under the lash of honest and "indignant virtue," they must shrink abashed, and in the end, conscious of their own insignificancy, and the diminu∣tion of their honor and respect from their citizens, they will leave the stage to better actors, and retire to the grave of in∣famy with remorse, and the curses of all good men on their heads. AMERICANS! do not your bosoms glow with indig∣nation at the concealed, nefareous and inimical conduct of that artful, intriguing and designing nation? And does not the blood burn your cheeks, and every fiery particle with which nature has endued you wake at once, when you re∣flect on the demands of her Directory by ADET, and to our late Ministers Plenipotentiary and Envoys Extraordinary? demands, which must rouse the sleeping dust of our patriotic sires to complain, should we now lie torpid, and call us cowards!!—But, it is impossible that we should have <HI>much</HI> to fear from that haughty power: For, does not the greatest unanimity prevail among all ranks of people who are deter∣mined to support their government, and to repel, with true American firmness, any invasion of their rights, and any in∣fringement on their constitution? And believe me, Citizens, while these sentiments are cherished, all the powers of <HI>France</HI> joined with the power of her allies, (the grim court of <HI>Pan∣demonium</HI>) shall not prevail against us. We have maintain∣ed our Independence through one struggle, and, thank God▪ we shall have an hundred, before one particle of our freedom
<PB N="12" REF="033732_0012_0FF8F045990E94D0"/>
is given up to any power on earth. Though the terrible re∣public has made rapid strides towards the subversion of the liberties of those States, bordering on her frontiers, yet all her power shall never appal the freeborn sons of <HI>America,</HI> or induce them to make any concessions derogatory to their na∣tional dignity and character. Though <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Switzer∣land</HI> have yielded to the conqueror; and though the fate of those countries is held up, with a view to intimidate us to ac∣cept the degrading proposals of the Directory, yet shall it teach us a far different lesson, shall instruct us to throw off foreign influence, to unite, and stand firm; and to swear▪ all, by the blood of our heroic sires, that we will see our country submerged, our friends and relations butchered, and every object, which induces us to love life, sunk in eternal oblivi∣on, before we will submit to the humiliating condition of be∣ing dictated by <HI>France,</HI> or any other foreign power.</P>
<P>AT a time like the present, when all <HI>Europe</HI> is in arms, and surprizing revolutions (formerly the production of cen∣turies) now arise every day, and while a powerful and fierce nation are endeavoring to tread our liberties under their feet, and blot out the name of our nation from the earth, the interest of <HI>America</HI> is to stand firm, and be prepared for the worst. The desperate efforts of an intoxicated junto, "goad∣ed by rashness and led on by folly," must be opposed with steadiness and strength; and this band of unprincipled ruf∣fians, who have abandoned reason, and lost sight of the high road to national honor, must at last yield to the united efforts of the powers of reason, virtue and GOD.—The principles on which government is founded it is not my province to define; but this must be obvious to any thinking person, for a nation to be prosperous, her government must be such that each citizen may feel it to be his <HI>own</HI> advantage to sup∣port that government; for it is impossible that any one can be induced to render free homage to the beauty of the <HI>whole,</HI> when he can see nothing for himself but abjectness and con∣tempt; but where there is a government, in which the peo∣ple can confide, and which secures to them the free enjoy∣ment of their rights and liberties, the <HI>sole</HI> interest of that peo∣ple is▪ to support their government against any and every in∣vasion; and as <HI>america</HI> possesses as much liberty as is in any wise necessary to her happiness, her citizens must support their government, by striking at which, they strike at their
<PB N="13" REF="033732_0013_0FF8F0497A2FBC98"/>
own existence. Order is Heaven's first law, and is most es∣sential to the happiness of man. Nature herself teaches us that there should be some subordination; and that the hap∣piness of society, and consequently of individuals, may be promoted, the governors and governed must each fulfil the circle marked by Heaven. It cannot be denied that a re∣publican government is the best; and we pray God, that it may be the only form of government for <HI>America</HI>—yet the most despotic government is better than anarchy;—and the disorganization of these <HI>United States</HI> must produce a state hydra which, after having destroyed all around, would, scor∣pion like, destroy itself. The present constitution of this country, is the only one by which we can support a republi∣can government; and by infringing on and fighting against this, we shall manifest to the world that we have not wisdom sufficient to govern ourselves, and that we are unworthy the glorious privileges of Independence. It is presumed, that this language is not necessary for this audience, who have given so many ample proofs of their Federalism, and deter∣mination to support their government; and charity strongly induces me to think that there are but a contemptible <HI>few</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> who are so callous to every sentiment of honor and even of humanity, as not to execrate the measures of the French directory to disorganize us, and cheerfully bestow their last mite in defence of that government which secures to them their Liberty;—Yet, perhaps it might have been better for <HI>America,</HI> had some of her citizens before considered these truths, for the eye of a candid observer cannot but trace a part of our contentions with <HI>France,</HI> from our own citizens; and never had she dared to behave in that affrontive manner to <HI>America,</HI> which has shone so conspicuous in all our inter∣course, had she not thought that a party in our own territo∣ries would declare on her side; how much then, Citizens, does it behove us, for the preservation of our national digni∣ty, to act in concert, to manifest a spirit to resist <HI>France</HI> in all her attempts against us; that the world may be convinc∣ed that we are not that divided and degraded people, which the whole conduct of the terrible republic implies that she dares to think us!</P>
<P>IN addressing this respectable audience, on this important occasion, let me not forget to pay the tribute of gratitude to those Heroes, who dared, in the face of arbitrary power, to
<PB N="14" REF="033732_0014_0FF8F04E8ACD6180"/>
sound the blast which freed us from the yoke of tyranny; and to those who submitted their bosoms to the shafts of death in defence of our Independence. Those of you, my countrymen, who were actors in those scenes, whose patriot∣ism has been fully proved in the "times which tried men's souls," must be sensible how feeble are any attempts of mine to describe the emotions of your souls in the day of battle, or to express the gratitude which must pervade the breast of each one who enjoys the prize, which you and they so dearly purchased—Our present circumstances do not demand the exertions, from us your offspring, which you were called upon to make; yet it must be some satisfaction to you to reflect that the same heroic sentiments, which impelled you to the field, remain in our bosoms, and that we here promise in the name of those heroes who were immolated on the altar of liberty, in the name of WASHINGTON and the surviving Patriots, that, should the clouds which now hang round our horizon, thicken to a tempest, should our country's calamity ever call us to her relief, we will not act unworthy the brave example presented to us; but that we are ready to abandon all the pleasures of a rural life, to march dauntless to the mouth of the cannon, and cheerfully resign up our lives in defence of our coutry's rights. And here suffer me, Fathers, to recommend to your attention, the <HI>education</HI> of your chil∣dren; for on their minds being well-formed, depends their future happiness, and the happiness of the country to which they belong. The benefits and the necessity of a people's being well informed, need not here be labored; suffice it to say, that tis the life and soul of Independence. In a gov∣ernment like ours, where the people fill all branches of sover∣eignty, so much information as may enable him to see the beauty of his constitution is absolutely necessary for every person. From ignorance proceed all our troubles and diffi∣culties: enlightened minds will never wear the yoke of sla∣very, nor be the factious and flagitious band to rise up in opposition to all order and government. And you, my young friends, who are happy to be the sons of <HI>America,</HI> as you may one day be called to be important actors on the stage, study to improve; let the love of your country, education and vir∣tue, fire your generous bosoms. In this country, no heredit∣ary distinctions obstruct the passage to eminence, or damp the ardor of the obscure youth; for Merit may raise him from

the humble scenes of a country life, to act his part on a thea∣tre, where not thousands but millions must sound his name with applause. Behold! the annals of fame lie open on the temple of immortality, inviting us to step forward with a becoming dignity, and enrol our names; let us seize the glo∣rious occasion, and command the admiration of a world!— And, ye fair daughters of this western world, "heaven's last best gift," whose charms add grace and dignity to this assem∣bly; you have great inducements to join with us in celebrat∣ing this birth day of your happiness. The important and distinguished rank in life, of the Fair Sex▪ is acknowledged in this country, and the rewards due to their merit are cheer∣fully bestowed by the Sons of <HI>America.</HI> Here, no avaricious sire (as is the custom in other nations) condemns you to wed the man you hate, or to drag out a miserable existence in the recesses of a cloister; but freedom of choice under the disci∣pline of a virtuous and refined education, constitutes a prin∣cipal part of your happiness. Your soft bosoms will there∣fore glow with gratitude, and your countenances bloom with joy, when you reflect that you are the Daughters of <HI>America.</HI> May education and virtue prompt you to reward merit and valor with your smiles, which are sufficient to alleviate any cares to which we may be called, in defence of our liberties, and which enhance, if not create, every blessing of life.</P>
<P>WHEN we cast round our eyes and behold this enlightened and flourishing people, spread over so extensive and fertile a region, whose gloomy forests are daily divested of some part of their rude attire, to make room for the splendid dome and lofty column, where we behold liberty, order, and all the blessings of life to be ours—Can we forbear, my country∣men, to sound the full paean of praise, and <HI>all</HI> with one ac∣cord join, in celebrating this birth day of Liberty—Twenty two full years have we experienced the utility, the excellence of the measure, which declared us free, and the prudence and wisdom of those who adopted it. Though some gloomy clouds <HI>now</HI> hang over our political horizon, yet if we learn to distinguish between the sophistry which has assailed our constitution, under the false forms of patriotism, and those sentiments of federalism, which form the true criterion of <HI>real</HI> patriotism, if we continue in the habits of industry, un∣nanimity, virtue, and valor, and if we strive to support our government in all cases, the storm will at length blow over,

and the fair sunshine of peace again illume our hemisphere. Let the anticipation of this event, so ardently wished for, fit us to quaff the social bowl, to indulge the glow of friendly intercourse and social harmony; and round this altar of free∣dom to offer to the GOD of Heaven our thankful acknowl¦edgements—and let the consideration, that the world are now spectators of our conduct, stimulate us to fulfil every duty—for if we do not defend these privileges, which we enjoy, our names will be handed down to endless posterity, in colors of the blackest dye, and our graves be made the graves of eternal infamy. But we are not to be enslaved; this en∣lightened people never will so much degenerate as to forget every feeling of humanity, and tamely lie down on the cold bosom of slavery!—Our Liberties and existence, Citizens, must and will be commensurate!—If we look forward into futurity, the prospect brightens to our view; and what mind but will expand to meet the glorious period. We behold <HI>America,</HI> (having subdued her enemies, and established the freedom of her citizens on firm foundations) rising like a phoenix, from the ruin of all monarchies, and convincing man∣kind, that 'tis under a republican government only that the arts of life are brought to perfection. Nor will the philan∣thropic heart forbear to anticipate the period, when the name of Liberty shall be known and held sacred in <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>Isles</HI>; and when the tawny inhabitants of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> shall bow the knee at her sacred shrine, and worship in her temple. Then shall all mankind cause incense to aspire to the GOD of Heaven, from an altar, whose foundation is the whole earth, and whose arch, the vault of heaven.</P>
