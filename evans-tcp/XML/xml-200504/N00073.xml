<HEAD>PRECEPTS FOR CHRISTIAN PRACTICE, Or the Rule of the New CREATVRE, To be daily observed by every Believer, in the practice of these ten following DUTIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="duty">
<HEAD>The first Duty.</HEAD>
<P>Bee alwayes sensible of thy original corruption, and consider how it inclineth thee continually to all evil, and indisposeth thee to any good; groan under it and bewaile it as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>Rom. 7.27. O wretched man that I am who shall deliver mee from the body of this death!</HI> Also take special notice of of your actual sin, or daily infirmities in thought, word, and deed; endeavour to make your peace with God before you go to bed.</P>
<P>Which must be done these four wayes.</P>
<P N="1">1. <SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y repenting and confessing your sins to God; work∣ing your hearts to grief and sorrow for them by some such melting con∣siderations as these. 1. Of

the goodness of God to you. 2 Of the un∣reasonableness and every way unprofitableness of sin; and 3. Of the great damage, pre∣judice, and hurt that commeth to the Soul by sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. By believing and casting your self wholly on Christs Righteousness for remission of sin, and for reconciliation with God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.22, 23, 24▪ 25 22. <HI>Even the righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st unto all, and upon all them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t believe: for there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 23. <HI>For all have sinned and come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the glory of God.</HI> 24. <HI>Being just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist.</HI> 25. <HI>Whom God hath set forth to be a prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bearance of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. By cleaving to Gods promise of pardon and peace, as <HI>Isai.</HI> 43.25. <HI>I even I am he that bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</HI> Rom. 5.1. <HI>There∣fore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="duty">
<PB N="3" REF="000116_0008_0FA029BC6628FB60"/>
<HEAD>The second Duty.</HEAD>
<P>Get your union with Christ and your interest in him cleared and confirmed to you daily more and more, that you are a branch in his vine, and a member in his body.</P>
<P>This is done three wayes.</P>
<P>FIrst, by daily renewal of your faith in Christ, especially of that act of faith whereby the soule knitteth or tyeth it self unto Christ; casts and rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es it self on Christ for salvation. Cause your hearts in a solemn manner every day to act this part, or to put forth this pri∣mitive act of faith in the view of the whole Soul: The daily exercise hereof will increase and strengthen the divine habit of faith in your Soul; and make your Soul sensible of the very act of it: By frequent believing you shall feel at your very heart that you do believe, so shall you have in your self a witness, that you are in Christ, 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5, 10. <HI>Hee that be∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eveth in the Son of God hath the witness in him∣self,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly, by examining your heart upon what grounds you took Christ to be yours: The grounds are these five. 1. A sight and
<PB N="4" REF="000116_0009_0FA029BDA22852E0"/>
sense of your sins, as of the guilt, power, and punishment of them, and of your misery by them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all yee that labour and be heavy leaden, and I will give you rest.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Your want of Christ seen, and felt at your very heart, to Justifie, Sanctifie, Redeem, and save you, else you are utterly lost, and un∣done everlastingly, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.10. <HI>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Gods free and general offer of Christ to any that will take him by Faith, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>For God so loved the World that hee gave his only be∣gotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> There are manifold promises to that purpose, and the grounds of all Gods offers and donations of Christ to the poor soul are free Grace, rich Mercy, undeserved Love, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us</HI>; 5. <HI>Even when wee were dead in sins hath quick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned us together with Christ (by grace yee are saved.)</HI> 6. <HI>And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus</HI>; 7. <HI>That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us.</HI> Titus 3, 4, 5, 6.
<PB N="5" REF="000116_0010_0FA029BDEADE3288"/>
<HI>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared</HI>; 5. <HI>Not by works of righteousness which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut according to his mercy he saved us by the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI> 6. <HI>Which he shed on us abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Christs sweet and gracious invitation of such to come to him as are weary of sin, and that have neither worth in themselves nor mony to buy, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come unto mee all yee that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> Isai. 55.1. <HI>Hoe every one that thirsteth come to the waters, and he that hath no money, come yee, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. As sinful vile wretches as you are, have been soug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Christ and found in Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.10, 11. <HI>Nor the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor covetous, nor drunkard, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall in∣herit the kingdom of God.</HI> 11. <HI>Such were some of you: but yee are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed, but yee are sanctified, but yee are justified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13 <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Blasphemer, Persecutor,</HI> and yet ob∣tained <HI>Mercy.</HI> Therefore why may not you? Thus the more clearly you discerne on what grounds you take Christ, the clearer will your

title to Christ be evidenced to your own soul.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>ly.</HI> By surveying and observing in what manner you take Christ daily, which is.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether you do wholly renounce all opinion and conceit of your own righteous∣ness and desert, <HI>Mark</HI> 8.34. <HI>Whosoever will come after me, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him deny himself, and take up his Crosse and follow me.</HI> Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. <HI>But what things were gaine to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</HI> 8. <HI>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for whom I have suffer∣ed the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.</HI> 9. <HI>And be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</HI> Thus you come to Christ empty of your self, yea very vile and nothing in your own eyes, unworthy to receive him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether you lay hold on Christ with an empty hand of faith, joyning nothing at all with Christ in the matter of salva∣tion, as the holy Martyr at the stake cryed out, <HI>None but Christ, none but Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Whether you finde the Father drawing your hearts after Christ, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.44. <HI>No man can come unto mee except the Father which hath

sent me draw him, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill raise him up at the last day</HI>: Which is in hungring and panting desires that will never be satisfied without him; So that both the stream of your judge∣ment, and affections run after him, as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. <HI>ver.</HI> 2. <HI>For</HI> I <HI>determined to to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ and him crucified</HI>▪ Gal. 6.14. <HI>But God forbid</HI> I <HI>should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom the World is Crucified unto me, and</HI> I <HI>unto the World.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Whether you take Christ as well for a Lord to rule you, as a Jesus to save you, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.6. <HI>As ye tberefore have received Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esus the Lord, so walk ye in him</HI>: As one that is <HI>all in all to you, your wisdome, your righteousness, your sanctification and redemption,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30. Your spiritual food, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.48. I <HI>am that bread of life</HI> ver. 55. <HI>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</HI></P>
<P>Your rayment, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.14. <HI>But put yee on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the Flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Your strength, <HI>Phil</HI> 4.13. I <HI>can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</HI></P>
<P>Your life, <HI>Gal▪</HI> 2.20. I <HI>am crucified with Christ, nevertheless</HI> I <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve, yet not</HI> I, <HI>but Christ liveth in mee; and the life which</HI> I <HI>now live in the Flesh,

I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved mee and gave himself for mee.</HI> Col 3.3. <HI>For yee are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Whether you seek and wait for Christ (out of the sense of your spiritual want and penury in every ordinance, publick and pri∣vate, Word, Sacraments▪ Prayer, Meditation and Conference, not as they are your own works of Sanctification, but as they are Gods Ordinances appointed on purpose, for the ma∣nifestation and communication of Christ to the Soul.

<P>FIrst, to perform all your duties, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, to exercise all your graces, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves but our suffici∣ency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000116_0014_0FA02A9D733E9760"/>Thirdly, to resist and overcome all your corruptions and temptations, Rom. 8.37. <HI>In all these things we are more then conquerers through him that loved us.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, to undergo all your tryals and afflictions, <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.16. <HI>And of his fulness have wee all received, and grace for grace.</HI></P>
<P>Make your provision of strength and grace from Christ, every morning fetch from him so much as you shall have occasion to use all the day long, yea and upon all occasions that fall out in the day, go to Christ still for the wisdome that must direct you, for the ho∣liness that must Character you for the shoulder that must bear your Crosses, for the strength that must resist your temptations, and for abi∣lity to perform all Duties as Duties.</P>
<P>To this end act your faith daily in the pro∣mises of grace and strength, as <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1 16. <HI>Of his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace,</HI> Isai. 44 3. <HI>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine off-spring,</HI> Ezek. 36.26, 27. <HI>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and</HI> I <HI>will give you an heart of flesh.</HI> 27. <HI>And</HI> I <HI>will put my Spirit

<P>This is the way and means to do all in the strength of Christ, and to take forth a great deal of Christ into your soules, <HI>that not you but Christ may live in you,</HI> Gal. 2.20. I <HI>am cruci∣fied with Christ: Nevertheless I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not</HI> I <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Christ liveth in me; and the life which</HI> I <HI>now live in the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh,</HI> I <HI>live by the faith of the Son of God▪ who loved me, and gave himself for mee.</HI></P>
