<P>I perceiving my self to be disenabled for the discharge of the du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties of my place by reason of the wound I had received, and appre∣hending that the Enemy would soon come to spoyle the Town, and Assault us in the house, I appointed <HI>Simon Davis</HI> of <HI>Concord, James Richardson,</HI> and <HI>John Fiske</HI> of <HI>Chelmsford</HI> to manage Affairs for our Safety with those few men whom God hath left us, and were fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Service, and the Inhabitants of the said Town; who did well and Commendably perform the duties of the Trust committed to them with much Courage and Resolution through the Assistance of our gracious God who did not leave us in our low and distress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> state, but did mercifully appear for us in our greatest need, as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sequel will clearly be manifested.

of new Companies to them</HI> to Assist and strengthen them, and the unlikelihood of any coming to our help. They also used several <HI>Stratagems to Fire us,</HI> namely by <HI>wild fire</HI> in <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Linnen Rags</HI> with <HI>Brimstone</HI> in them, which Rags they tyed to the <HI>Piles of their Arrows</HI> sharp for the purpose, and shot them to the Roof of our house, after they had <HI>set them on Fire,</HI> which would have much endangered the burning thereof, had we not used means by cutting <HI>holes through the Roof,</HI> and otherwise, to beat the said <HI>Arrows</HI> down, and God being pleased to prosper our Indeavours therein.

They also devised other <HI>Stratagems</HI> to fire our house on the night follow∣ing, namely, they took a <HI>Cart,</HI> and filled it with <HI>Flax, Hay and Candlewood,</HI> and other <HI>Combustible matter,</HI> and set up <HI>Planks</HI> fasten∣ed to the Cart to save themselves from the danger of our shot. Ano∣ther Invention they had to make the more sure work in burning the house. They got many <HI>Poles</HI> of a Considerable length and bigness, and <HI>spliced them together</HI> at the Ends one of another, and made a Car∣riage of them about <HI>fourteen Rods long,</HI> setting the Poles in two Rows with peils laid cross over them at the <HI>Front End,</HI> and dividing them said Poles about <HI>three foot</HI> asunder, and in the said <HI>Front</HI> of this their Carriage they set a <HI>Barrel,</HI> having made an <HI>hole</HI> through both Heads, and put an <HI>Axle-Tree</HI> through them, to which they fastened the said <HI>Poles,</HI> and under every joynt of the <HI>Poles</HI> where they were <HI>spliced,</HI> they set up a a <HI>pair of Truckle wheeles</HI> to bear up the said Car∣riages, and they <HI>loaded the Front</HI> or fore-end thereof with matter <HI>fit for firing,</HI> as <HI>Hay,</HI> and <HI>Flaxe,</HI> and <HI>Chips,</HI> &amp;c.

about an <HI>hour after it was dark</HI> as abovesaid; though he knew not then, neither of our being there, nor of what had befallen us at the <HI>Swampe</HI> and in the house those two dayes before.</P>
<P>The merciful Providence of God also appeared in preventing the danger that the <HI>Honoured Major</HI> and his <HI>Company</HI> might have been in, when they came near to us, for those <HI>Beastly men</HI> our <HI>Ene∣mies Skilful to destroy,</HI> Indeavoured to prevent any help from com∣ing to our Relief, and therefore sent down <HI>Sentinels,</HI> (some nearer and some further off) the furthest about <HI>two miles</HI> from us, who if they saw any coming from the <HI>Bay</HI> they might give notice by an <HI>Alarm.</HI> And there were about an <HI>hundred</HI> of them who for the most part kept at an house some little distance from us, by which if any help came from the said <HI>Bay,</HI> they must pass, and so they in∣tended (as we conceive) having notice by their <HI>Sentinels</HI> of their approach to <HI>way-lay them,</HI> and if they could, to <HI>cut them off</HI> before they came to the house where we kept.</P>
<P>But as we propably guess, they were so intent and buisy in prepa∣ring their Instruments (as abovesaid) for our destruction by Fire, that they were not at the house where they used to keep for the pur∣pose aforesaid, and that they heard not their <HI>Sentinels</HI> when they <HI>shot</HI>; and so the <HI>Majors</HI> way was clear from danger till he came to our house. And that it was their purpose so to have fallen upon him, or any other coming to us at that house, is the more propable in that (as we have since had Intelligence from some of the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves) there were a party of them at <HI>another place</HI> who <HI>let him pass by them</HI> without the least hurt or Opposition, waiting for a <HI>blow to be given</HI> him at the said <HI>house,</HI> and then they themselves to fall upon them in the <HI>Reare,</HI> as they intended to have done with us at the <HI>Swamp,</HI> in Case we had <HI>fled back</HI> as is before expressed. The <HI>Major</HI> &amp; <HI>Company</HI> were no sooner come to the house, and understood (though at first they know not they were <HI>English</HI> who were in the house, but thought that they might be <HI>Indians,</HI> and therefore were ready to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve shot at us, till we discerning they were <HI>English</HI> by the <HI>Majors</HI> speaking, I caused the <HI>Trumpet to be sounded</HI>) that the said <HI>Captain Hutchinson, my self, and Company</HI> with the <HI>Towns Inhabitants</HI> were there, but the <HI>Indians</HI> also discerned that there were some come to our Assistance, whereupon they spared not their shot, but poured it

out on them; but through the Lords goodness, though they stood not farr asunder one from another, they <HI>killed not one man,</HI> wounded on∣ly <HI>two</HI> of his Company; and killed the <HI>Majors Sons horse</HI>; after that we within the house perceived the <HI>Indians</HI> shooting so at them, we hastened the <HI>Major</HI> and all his Company into the house as fast as we could, and their horses into a little yard before the house, where they wounded <HI>five other horses</HI> that night; After they were come into the house to us, the <HI>Enemies</HI> continued their shooting some Con∣siderable time, so that we may well say, <HI>had not the Lord been on our side when these Cruel Heathens rose up against us, they had then swal∣lowed us up quick,</HI> when their wrath was kindled against us. But <HI>wherein they dealt proudly, the Lord was above them.</HI></P>
<P>When they saw their <HI>divers designes unsuccessful,</HI> and their hopes therin disappointed, they then fired the <HI>house</HI> &amp; <HI>barne</HI> (wherein they had before kept to lye in wait to surprize any coming to us) that by the Light thereof they might the better direct their shot at us, but <HI>no hurt</HI> was done thereby <HI>praised be the Lord.</HI> And not long after they burnt the <HI>Meeting house</HI> wherein their Fortifications were, as al∣so the <HI>Barne</HI> which belonged to our house, and so perceiving more strength come to our Assistance: they did as we suppose, <HI>despaîr of effecting</HI> any more mischief against us.

We came to <HI>Marlborough</HI> on <HI>August the Fourteenth,</HI> where <HI>Captain Hutchinson</HI> being not recovered of his wound before his coming from <HI>Brookfield,</HI> and overtyred with his <HI>long Journy</HI> by Rea∣son of his weakness quickly after grew worse, and more dangerous∣ly ill, and on the <HI>nineteenth day</HI> of the said moneth dyed, and was there the day after buried, the Lord being pleased to deny him a re∣turn to his own habitation, and his near Relations at <HI>Boston,</HI> though he was come the greatest part of his Journy thitherward. The In∣habitants of the <HI>Town</HI> also not long after, <HI>men, women,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> removed safely with what they had left to several places, either where they had lived before their planting or sitting down there; or where they had Relations to receive and entertain them. The Ho∣noured <HI>Major Willard</HI> stayed at <HI>Brookfield</HI> some weeks after our coming away, there being several Companies of Souldiers sent up thither and to <HI>Hadly</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, which are about <HI>Thirty Miles</HI> from <HI>Brookfield,</HI> whither also the <HI>Major</HI> went for a time upon the Service of the Country in the present warr, and from whence there being need of his presence for the ordering of matters concerning his own <HI>Regiment</HI> and the safety of the <HI>Towns</HI> belong∣ing to it, he through Gods goodness and mercy return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in safety and health to his house, and dear Relations at <HI>Groaton.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have Indeavoured to set down and declare both what the Lord did against us in the Loss of several persons Lifes, and the wounding of others, some of which wounds were very painful in dressing, and long ere they were healed, besides many dangers that we were in, and fears that we were exercised with; and also what great things he was pleased to do for us in frustrating their many At∣tempts, and vouchsafing such a Deliverance to us.

<P>Accordingly the holy Prophet (very probably <HI>David</HI>) in this Psalm sets before us the Exercise of his grace in various Conditions which befell him: He tels us what he did in the time of great <HI>Af∣fliction and Distress</HI>; he prayed, <HI>He called upon the Name of the Lord: ver. 3, 4.</HI> and being delivered and helped what he did, and was resolved to do: <HI>He loved the Lord,</HI> and would <HI>walk before him in the Land of the Living</HI>; He was thankful, and would express his <HI>gratitude</HI> in his <HI>Conversation</HI>; yea, is Inquisitive, what further to do

therein; as in the Text, <HI>what shall I Render,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Psalm then is <HI>Eucharistical</HI>; or <HI>Gratulatory,</HI> wherein the <HI>Psalmist</HI> giveth praise to God for his <HI>favour</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> in a great <HI>Deliverance</HI> from a <HI>deadly danger</HI> and <HI>distress</HI>; and so suitable to the present occasion of our meeting at this time; If <HI>David</HI> were the Penman thereof, the Deliverance may be that mentioned, <HI>Psal. 18.</HI> Title: His preservation from <HI>Sauls furious</HI> and <HI>malicious Persecuti∣on,</HI> and the rage and violence of all his Adherents, and all others that sought his Ruine.</P>
<P>The words read contein a <HI>Pathetical Exclamation</HI> and <HI>Enquiry; what shall I render,</HI> &amp;c. as if he should say; The Lord hath bestowed <HI>mercies,</HI> yea, many and great mercies upon me; He hath <HI>heard my prayer</HI> when the <HI>sorrows of death encompassed me, helped me</HI> when I was <HI>brought very low</HI>; something is to be returned to him, that even Reason suggests, yea, much is to be done; but what that is I am (as it were) at a Loss, I would do any thing to please and honour him, who hath done so much for me.</P>
<P>In the words there are <HI>two parts.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. An <HI>Inquisition</HI>; wherein we may Consider: 1. The <HI>Subject</HI> or matter enquired after: <HI>what shall I render</HI>: 2<HI>dly.</HI> The <HI>Object</HI> or person concerning whom the Enquiry is made, and to whom the Return is to be made, and that is <HI>Jehovah</HI>; Not man but <HI>the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The Reason of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and that is the Consideration of <HI>all his Benefits</HI>; There was just occasion to be so sollicitous; <HI>Gods Benefits,</HI> set out, 1. <HI>By an Amplification</HI> All, <HI>All his Benefits.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly, By an Application,</HI> towards me; All his Benefits <HI>towards me.</HI></P>
<P>In this verse we have the <HI>Question,</HI> In the verses following we have the <HI>Resolution</HI>; He will <HI>take the Cup of Salvation,</HI> &amp;c. and He will <HI>pay the Vows</HI> which he had made in his Trouble and Distress.</P>
<P>For Explication of the Terms [<HI>Render</HI>] The word Imports a kind of <HI>Requital</HI>; It is attributed both to God and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n▪ and that in Relation to a good thing done, and signifies to reward, and to an Evil, and signifies to <HI>Revenge</HI>: Here it is Attributed to <HI>man in Re∣lation to God,</HI> but not as importing any possibility and satisfaction,
<PB N="3" REF="000226_0022_0FA36CA0C7BA5138"/>
but only a <HI>readiness</HI> and <HI>forwardness</HI> to do any thing that might be ac∣ceptable to him.</P>
<P>[<HI>Benefits</HI>] The word in the <HI>Original</HI> is derived of that Verb which in the <HI>seventh verse</HI> is Translated [<HI>dealt bountifully</HI>] Gods Bounties: And these the Prophet stiles <HI>His Benefit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> acknowledg∣ing all the good he received to come from him.</P>
<P>The Verse then is a Description of the frame of heart of a <HI>faith∣ful Thanksgiver.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In his <HI>Observation</HI> of Gods dispensation towards him, in the <HI>Benefits bestowed on him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> In his <HI>Sollicitousness</HI> what to do by way of <HI>Retribution,</HI> and his willingness to do whatsoever he knows may be acceptable to him and approved by him.</P>
<P>Hence this Doctrine may be raised.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>A person or people in a right thankful frame upon the Obser∣vation of Gods Benifits, and Bountiful favours towards them, are very Sollicitous what to return to God for them.</HI> Or such <HI>as are after God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heart upon their Observation of mercies and deliverances bestow∣ed on them are Sollicitous what Returns to make to God for them</HI>:</P>
<P>There be two parts in the Doctrine. 1. That a gracious Heart <HI>observes</HI> and takes notice of Gods goodness towards him. 2<HI>dly,</HI> He is thereupon <HI>Inquisitive</HI> what to <HI>Return</HI> to God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Prophet takes notice of Gods goodness; His <HI>Inquisition</HI> what to return, for it argues his <HI>Observation</HI> of it; If he enquires <HI>what to Render,</HI> It argues his tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng notice of the <HI>Benefits</HI>; yea, of the <HI>variety and multitude</HI> of them, in what God had been doing for him. So <HI>David</HI> tels us <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.14. <HI>marveilous are thy works and that my Soul knoweth right well.</HI> So also in <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.1, to the <HI>sixth verse, Neh</HI> 9.7, to 27<HI>th verse</HI>: They take notice of the great and manifold mercies which God had bestowed upon his people <HI>Israel</HI> in former as well as latter times. The Reasons hereof a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e▪</P>
<P>Reason 1. <HI>From the worth of every on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Gods mercies.</HI> There is not one of <HI>All</HI> of Gods <HI>Benefits,</HI> and the blessings which we enjoy but it is worthy of <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice,</HI> for it is the <HI>Lords work</HI>; the <HI>Operation of his hands,</HI> every mercy is Gods gift, and therefore to be Eyed and ob∣served, <HI>Psal.</HI> 111.2. <HI>The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</HI> As your de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iverance from the great
<PB N="4" REF="000226_0023_0FA36CA189D6B128"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anger you were in at the <HI>Swampe,</HI> and afterwards in the House: It's worthy <HI>observing</HI> and <HI>remembring</HI>: how much more, <HI>All our mercies</HI> at all time and in all places. All comes from God, <HI>Jam. 1.17. Every goood and perfect gift commeth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Reason 2. <HI>From the Thankfulness we owe to God</HI> for every mer∣cy being <HI>unworthy of the least of them</HI>; as <HI>Gen.</HI> 31 10. <HI>Jacob</HI> hum∣bly acknowledgeth. Now, how shall we be Thankful for them if we do not observe them. Hence the Prophet to Induce men to <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> and to bless God for his goodness and mercy adviseth men to take notice of his kindness towards them: <HI>Psal.</HI> 100.3, 4. And when the Lord upbraids his people for their great Ingratitude towards him, he gives this as one Cause of it, and so expresseth it, <HI>they did not know nor Consider, Isai. 1.3.</HI> and <HI>Hos: 2.8. she did not know that I gave,</HI> &amp;c that is, she did not seriously <HI>Consider</HI> of it, that thereby she might have been stirred up to <HI>Thankfolnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in obedience.</P>
<P>Reason 3. <HI>From the great difficulty of raising up our dull and slug∣gish hearts to that gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t duty of praise and Thankfulness,</HI> especially, in a lively and spiritual frame; and therefore there is great need to observe not only some, but <HI>All his Benefits</HI>: Though <HI>one mercy</HI>▪ should raise our Hearts to Heaven; yet the more to quicken and en∣large them, we should take notice of <HI>All</HI>; the variety of them; as praise is a <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficult duty,</HI> so it is difficult raising our hearts to the <HI>du∣ty.</HI> We are <HI>dull and Listless</HI> to all duty, but especially to <HI>Thank∣fulness</HI>; We are <HI>slow to go to God for mercy</HI> in our Troubles and Di∣stresses, but more slow to <HI>Return praise</HI> after <HI>Deliverances</HI> vouchsa∣fed. Hence that Expression in <HI>Psal.</HI> 107. Psal. 8.15.21., 31. <HI>Oh that men would praise the Lord</HI>; as if he should say: It's rather to be wished then expected, <HI>Luke 17.17, 18.</HI> There were Ten cried <HI>Lord have mercy upon us,</HI> but only <HI>one Returned to give Thanks</HI> to Jesus Christ when cured.</P>
<P>The second part of the Doctrine. <HI>Gracious and Humble Hearts observing Gods goodness towards them, are studious and Sollicitous what to Return to him.</HI> So the Prophet here, <HI>what shall I Render to the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. so 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.1. when God had brought him to Rest in his Kingdome after so many wandrings; he was studying how to advance the honour of God, who had done so great things for him; had so delivered him, so <HI>advanced him</HI> to <HI>honour and Renown,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000226_0024_0FA36CA2477EEE18"/>
3.9. what <HI>Thanks</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>can we Render.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Reasons hereof are,</P>
<P>Reason 1. <HI>From the Consideration of the Nature of the Benefits,</HI> Gods people enjoy; The Prophet here may well say, <HI>what shall I Render,</HI> &amp;c. and so may every Child of God say; All that are in Covenant with him; <HI>what shall we Render</HI> for the Benefits we have received from our God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are great mercies</HI>; even very great; as the promises of good to be given are <HI>great Promises,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. so the good promi∣sed and bestowed. They are <HI>great favours,</HI> especially in <HI>spiritual blessings.</HI> He gives great Deliverances; as <HI>Psal. 18.50.</HI> he doth great Things for his, as <HI>Psal. 71.19.</HI> and <HI>86.13.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are very many; There is an <HI>All</HI> of them, as in the Text; an <HI>All</HI> that is beyond Expression, <HI>Psal. 139.14. more in num∣ber then the sand.</HI> There is a multitude of them: This was an Ag∣gravation of <HI>Israels</HI> sin, that they <HI>remembred not the multitude of Gods mercies,</HI> Psal. 106.7.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly, They are Everlasting mercies,</HI> Psal. 136. In every verse <HI>thy mercy endures for ever</HI>; Gods people see and acknowledge <HI>Ever∣lasting mercy,</HI> even in outward and temporal blessings; much more in spiritual and Eternal: Because though the mercies themselves do not <HI>Indure for ever,</HI> yet the Foundation of all to Gods people is <HI>Ever∣lasting grace &amp; mercy</HI>; And besides even these do in some degree tend to further their <HI>Everlasting blessedness</HI>; helping them on in their way to their <HI>Fathers house</HI> in heaven; therefore there is Reason to study and be Sollicitous what to render to God for them.</P>
<P>Reason 2. <HI>From the Consideration of the person</HI> from whom the Blessings and Deliverances come, and to whom the Return is to be made, and that is, <HI>the Lord,</HI> what shall I Render <HI>to the Lord</HI> for His Benefits.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the good we enjoy is <HI>from the Lord</HI>: we are the <HI>Receivers,</HI> He the <HI>giver.</HI> They are his <HI>Benefits</HI>: yea, the gifts of the <HI>Lord of Lords and King of Kings,</HI> the great and mighty God, who Inhabits the Throne of glory. Oh that the God of glory should have any re∣spect to us <HI>dust and Ashe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that he should do so great things for us
<PB N="6" REF="000226_0025_0FA36CA3090F84E0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthless ones; Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>13.5, 6, 7. <HI>who is like unto the Lord our God who dwelleth on High; who humbleth himself,</HI> &amp;c. He raiseth <HI>the poor out of the Dust,</HI> &amp;c. A good look from a Prince or some other great and honourable person, is more then a greater thing from a meaner person.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Our <HI>Returns are to be made to the Lord,</HI> and therefore we had need be Careful what we present to him: This Reason God him∣self gives why he <HI>Curseth the deceiver</HI> who hath a <HI>male in his Flock,</HI> and offereth to God a <HI>corrupt thing</HI>; because he is a <HI>great King: Mal. 1.14.</HI> and therefore he sharply reproves them for offering the <HI>halt and blind.</HI> vers. 8. Persons are usually Careful how they carry themselves towards a great man in returning Thanks to him for favours received from him; much more here ought there to be Care; The Return is to be made to God.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> gives this Reason of the <HI>magnificence</HI> of the house he was to Build, It was for <HI>the Lord</HI> who is a great and glorious one: <HI>2 Chr. 2.5.</HI> Any manner of house would not serve the turn, the best <HI>Tim∣ber</HI> and <HI>stone</HI> must be provided, and it must be wrought in the best manner, and by the <HI>most Skilful persons</HI> that could be procured. This was <HI>Abel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Commendation, that he brought of the <HI>Firstlings of his Flock</HI> and of the <HI>fat thereof,</HI> Gen. 4 4. and to him God had Re∣spect and to his Offering.</P>
<P>Reason 3. <HI>From the Consideration of the person</HI> that is to make the Return to God; <HI>what shall I Return</HI>; I that am so <HI>unworthy of the least mercy</HI>: I that have had so <HI>many mercies,</HI> so great <HI>Deliverances,</HI> I that am notable to Render any thing <HI>beseeming his Majesty</HI>; I that am un∣der so many <HI>Bonds and Obligations</HI>; I that am so <HI>priviledged by God; what shall I Render,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hence that Expression, 2. <HI>Sam. 17, 18, 19, 20. What can David say,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>David</HI> the youngest of all my Fathers Sons, and yet was preferred before them; <HI>David</HI> that was a <HI>Shepard,</HI> and now advan∣ced to <HI>Regal dignity; David</HI> that was so persecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by <HI>potent</HI> and <HI>cruel</HI> Enemies, and hath been so graciously and wonderfully pre∣served. This makes a thankful heart <HI>studious,</HI> especially, Conside∣ring these three things therewith.</P>
<P N="1">1. All that we can Return is but <HI>little</HI> to his mercies; but <HI>mites</HI> for <HI>Talents; words</HI> for <HI>wonders</HI>; All is as nothing▪</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="000226_0026_0FA36CA3C7DB8920"/>2<HI>dly,</HI> What we Return to God is (and by Reason of sin in dwel∣ling will be) mixt with many Imperfections; our best Services are but as <HI>torne Rags, menstruous Cloaths,</HI> Isai. 64.6. Even our <HI>Robes,</HI> our best Services need washing in the <HI>Blood of the Lord,</HI> Revel. 7.14</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> All that we can give to God is <HI>His own</HI>; and is but little of his own; and therefore the Saints are sensible of their own Ina∣bility to make any meet Requital to God. Mark holy <HI>Davids</HI> Expressions after <HI>his and the Princes offering</HI> towards the <HI>Building of the Temple,</HI> 1 Chron. 29.10, to 15. <HI>vers.</HI> a full place to prove all these three particulars before mentioned.</P>
<P>Use I. By <HI>way of Instruction</HI> or <HI>Information.</HI></P>
<P>Instruct. 1. A Soul in a <HI>thankful frame,</HI> in a Tune of Thanksgiv∣ing can never be <HI>sufficiently satisfied</HI> in <HI>thinking</HI> and <HI>speaking</HI> of <HI>Gods mercies</HI> and favours towards him. The Prophet had before in this <HI>Psalm</HI> spoken of Gods goodness towards him; acknowledged his <HI>Bounty,</HI> what God had done for him; yea, again and again, repea∣ted it: and yet he is here still at the same work in the Text: <HI>What shall</HI> I <HI>Render,</HI> &amp;c. yea, again, <HI>Psal. 16.17. How great</HI> hath Gods goodness been in <HI>hearing prayer, rescuing</HI> me from <HI>deadly dangers, helping</HI> me when I was in a <HI>low Estate, delivering mine Eyes from Tears,</HI> &amp;c. bestowing so many <HI>Benefits,</HI> loosing my <HI>bonds,</HI> Ps. 136. In every verse, <HI>Thy mercy endureth for ever. Oh praise, give thanks for his mercy</HI>: and when he was concluding, he was ready to begin again: <HI>Oh give Thanks,</HI> ver. 26. <HI>Oh give Thanks to the God of Hea∣ven,</HI> for, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A thankeful heart in a lively frame takes delight to speak of the goodness of God towards him, Is not soon tyred nor weary thereof. All <HI>Repetitions</HI> are not babling: and therefore let us beware of so judging them; sometimes out of the Aboundance of the Heart Christians go over and over the same thing in <HI>petition</HI> of good from God and in <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> for good received at his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Instruct.</HI> 2. The Lord so dispenseth mercy to his people, as there∣by he leads them unto <HI>special</HI> and <HI>solemn seasons of Thanksgiving</HI>: Though he do afflict them, visit them with Rods, yet in the midst of those Exercises, he so dispenseth favours that they have Cause and just occasion, not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of ordinary, but also <HI>Extraordinary praises.</HI> Their mercies come in a more then ordinary way, and so call for more then ordinary praises.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000226_0027_0FA36CA4876927E0"/>Sometimes God giveth them <HI>mercies</HI> through many difficulties, as <HI>water out of the Rock</HI>: Deut. 32.13. which together with their ne∣cessity made the water as <HI>hony and Oyle</HI>: God could give them a∣nother way, he goes that way, that thereby he might provoke them to <HI>Thanksgiving</HI>: Divers Instances we have in <HI>Psal. 107.</HI> some he casts into <HI>Exile,</HI> and delivers them: others into <HI>Bonds and Imprison∣ment,</HI> and releaseth them, others he makes <HI>sick</HI> and heals them, that they may praise him.</P>

As <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts 21.14. How ungrateful then are they that will not do what they know to be pleasing to God, though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be clearly set before them, and strongly urged on them? <HI>young men</HI> are called upon to <HI>turn to God quickly; elder</HI> and <HI>younger</HI> ones to <HI>seek after him</HI> in all his holy Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nances; to forsake their Lusts and vain Company; but they will not; <HI>they hold fast deceit</HI> and refuse to Return.</P>
<P>They know what is good, but will not do it. Many know their duties in their Relations towards <HI>Superiours</HI> and <HI>Inferiours,</HI> but <HI>will not</HI> yield to them. And though some for Carnal sinister Respects do many things; as <HI>Jehu, Herod,</HI> &amp;c. yet at something they stick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, some <HI>Dalilah</HI> they will keep, some <HI>Lust</HI> they will not part withal, some duty they will not perform.

<P><HI>Instruct. 4th.</HI> To be truly thankful to God is an high, and a ve∣ry Spiritual Service; It is a Rendring and making Returns to God: <HI>what shall I Render to God,</HI> &amp;c.

It is a great matter to be admired, that God should honour us, therefore saith the Pro∣phet, <HI>what is man that thou art mindful of him,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>Thou hast Crowned him with glory and honour</HI>; but for us to honour God is greater; It is an high duty for the Sons of men, which are but worms to rise so high as to honour God: p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aising of God is an ex∣tolling or Exalting God, <HI>Exod. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.2.</HI> He is higher then to be exalted

Think it not an easy thing to praise the Lord; It is not only a lip labour, an easy Service; It is a Rendring to God. To play on Musick is plea∣sant, but it is hard to set the Instrument in Tune to play well; It is hard to get the heart in Tune, in a Spiritual lively, humble frame; Hence <HI>David</HI> so stirs up himself to it, <HI>Psal. 103.1, 2,</HI> and <HI>Deborab</HI> calls upon her self to awake, <HI>Judg. 5.12.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Instruct. 5th.</HI> Gods doings are the matter of the Saints Acknow∣ledgements in their Thanksgivings and praises of him. The word Translated <HI>Praise</HI> signifies <HI>Confession</HI> and so often Rendred by <HI>Mr. Ainsworth.</HI> Confess the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Lords doings are the matter of their Confessions: [<HI>his Benefits</HI>] what he hath done for me, and others of his people, the works of his hands for mine and others deliverance and Salvation.

<P>An <HI>Eccho</HI> is little else but a Reflecting Repetition of the first sound; so our praises are Repetitions, reflecting the work on God; He heard, he helped, he delivered and saved; <HI>This is the Lords doings.</HI> There is an <HI>Amen</HI> in Thanksgiving, our <HI>Amen</HI> to the Truth of Gods dis∣pensations; we say <HI>Amen</HI> to them; so they are, and we acknow∣ledge it. To give Thanks is to give God a Tribute in the Confession of his goodness; It is Retribution: This is to Crown the Lord, we owne him the Author of all our manifold Comforts, Deliverances, supplies in one kind or other. There is a distinction made between glory and glorification; glory is an Essential Attribute, though there were no Angel or man; but glorification is the acknowledgement of his power, goodness, mercy in his works by the Rational Crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure.</P>

<P N="4">4. Manifest a sincere love of God in minding the things of God, whereby he may be honoured, his Name advanced, his Truths pro∣pagated from generation to generation.</P>
<P>Love will stick at nothing whereby it may honour God, It is a Bountiful affection. Gods love to man did make him part with his <HI>only begotten Son,</HI> he spared not him but gave him to dye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> John 3.16. <HI>Abraham</HI> will part with his <HI>Isaack</HI> at Gods Command: nay, Love never knoweth when it hath done enough; It knows no such thing as <HI>too much,</HI> or <HI>too soon</HI>; The Soul thinks it cannot be too quick, too forward in any Service of God.

<P><HI>Mot.</HI> 2. When we have <HI>prevailed with God</HI> for any special mer∣cy, deliverance or help in a day of trouble, there is yet great need of <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>Continuance</HI> thereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. For a <HI>thankful heart</HI> to the giver of every <HI>good</HI> and <HI>perfect gift</HI>; the <HI>God of our Salvations.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For the <HI>Continuance</HI> of the <HI>mercy,</HI> that it may not be taken away from us; that the Evil removed may not again return.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the <HI>Sanctification</HI> of the <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>blessing</HI> to us, need to pray for an heart to use it in a right manner to the honour of Gods Name and others good.</P>
<P>That it may not be an <HI>occasion of sin</HI> to us, that it may not be <HI>abu∣sed</HI> by us; That when God is good to us, we may not be the worse in our wayes towards him. There is great need of <HI>prayer to God</HI> in a <HI>time of prosperity,</HI> that we may improve it to glorifie him in our <HI>particular places</HI> wherein we are set by him.</P>
<P N="4">4. we shall be yet needing more and <HI>renewed mercies</HI> daily, whilst we are here in this world, and therefore we must be <HI>Beggars</HI> till we get to Heaven: we need more <HI>grace, wisdome</HI> for our work and bu∣siness in our <HI>stations</HI>; more <HI>mortification</HI> of our Corruptions, more power against our <HI>great Adversary Satan,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="4">4.

<P><HI>Mot.</HI> 1. It is <HI>folly to Vow and not to pay</HI>; and God <HI>taketh no pleasure in Fools,</HI> Eccles 54 5, 6.</P>
<P>It is <HI>hateful folly</HI>; Better not have vowed, then vow and not pay.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>great Aggravation of sin,</HI> when it is against <HI>solemn Vows</HI>; and therefrre take heed to your wayes: If you did not vow in that time of danger, yet you have vowed in your <HI>Baptisme</HI>; that you would be the <HI>Lords Servants,</HI> &amp; keep his Commandments, But I doubt not, but that you had serious thoughts then on those two or three dayes while your Trouble chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asted, that if God would return you in <HI>peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Safety</HI> to your Habitations, to the Enjoyment of your Re∣lations, you would walk more to the praise of his Name, and the ho∣nour of the Gospel: That if the Lord would preserve you from <HI>vi∣olent</HI> and <HI>ungodly men</HI> that sought your <HI>Ruine,</HI> you would be more <HI>faithful Servants</HI> to him: Oh take heed to your selves, that you forget not the <HI>promises</HI> wherein you have bound your Souls: After de∣liverance had from God, <HI>Return not to folly,</HI> Psal▪ 85.8.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, God <HI>hath the Bond,</HI> and it will be called for. Though we may forget and little regard our <HI>Vows</HI> and and the payment of them, yet God remembers all our Vows and <HI>Engagements</HI>; one time or other, we shall be put in mind of them.
