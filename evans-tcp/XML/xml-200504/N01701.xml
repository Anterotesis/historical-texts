<HEAD>SOME <HI>Reasons</HI> &amp; <HI>Arguments</HI> Offered to the Good People of <HI>BOSTON</HI> and adjacent Places, for the setting up <HI>Markets</HI> in BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is to the Surprise of all Strangers who come among us, that in so large and popu∣lous a <HI>Town</HI> as this of <HI>Boston</HI> is, they find no particular <HI>days</HI> of the week, nor appointed <HI>places</HI> in the Town fix'd for the holding of <HI>Markets</HI>; for the more ready and easy sup∣ply of the Town with the Provisions which are every week, and more or less every day bro't in from the Nei'bouring Towns. All the World besides us, have gone into the usage of <HI>Markets</HI> as a point of wisdom and prudence, long be∣fore a Town is grown to half our Bulk and Number, not to say without a tenth part of our Trade and busi∣ness; and why it should be prudent in us, or for our
<PB N="2" REF="002019_0004_0FBA84B723918F70"/>
Interest, to live thus without <HI>one</HI> is altogether unac∣countable. They that have travel'd into other parts of the world have there seen the <HI>Convenience,</HI> the <HI>Order,</HI> the <HI>Beauty</HI> of their Markets; the Towns and Country round about finding their mutual Advantage and Account in it. When we come home again and see this comely Order and general Benefit wanting in so <HI>fine</HI> a Town, and so many disorders and mischiefs attending both the Town and Country from the want thereof, it seems such a defect of wisdom in us, as can hardly be excused. We cannot think our selves <HI>wiser</HI> than all the world besides, nor that we under∣stand the Art of living well better than they, nor the joint Interest of City and Country better. We cannot say that <HI>this</HI> of Markets is one of those things where∣in one would not desire to conform to the rest of the World; as one would shun their Vices and evil Customs: I hope by the following Argument to make it appear that the <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>good Morals,</HI> as well as the worldly Estate and Interests, both of Town and Country will probably be much served and better'd hereby. We are the <HI>Head</HI> here of a large <HI>Province,</HI> and none of the Nei'bouring <HI>Provinces</HI> can shew any thing like us; and yet if we go to <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>Phyladelphia,</HI> we find them already come into fixed days and publick appoint∣ed places for weekly Markets. The <HI>Enquiry</HI> now be∣fore us is, <HI>Why we shou'd not come into the like Practice?</HI></P>
<P>And here before I go a step further, I think it need∣ful to protest unto my <HI>Countrymen,</HI> that in this Essay I aim at the <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> Good both of <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Country</HI>; that I have no private Interest separate from my Nei'bours to move me; and that particularly I am mov'd by a regard to the <HI>Vertue</HI> as well as <HI>Out∣ward</HI> flourishing of the Country. And having said this seriously, I claim the more regard to my follow∣ing <HI>Argument.</HI></P>
<P>And first I shall consider some of the manifest <HI>Bene∣fits</HI> which would accrew both to the Town and Coun∣try
<PB N="3" REF="002019_0005_0FBA84B827ED0DD8"/>
from stated and publick <HI>Markets</HI>; together with the manifest Inconveniences and <HI>Mischiefs</HI> both to Town and Country from the want of 'em.</P>
<P>And then, I will give some Answer to the <HI>Objections</HI> that may be made against a Market.</P>
<P>First then, I will consider some of the manifest <HI>Benefits,</HI> which wou'd accrew both to the Town and Country from stated and publick Markets; together with the Inconveniences and <HI>Mischiefs</HI> that ly upon us for want of one.</P>
<P>Now the first Mischief we suffer from the want of a Market is, <HI>a great loss of precious time</HI> every week, and one grand <HI>Benefit</HI> of a Market would be the <HI>saving</HI> it. <HI>Time</HI> is the common Talent of all Persons, and a very precious One, which it is every ones Interest to re∣deem for himself and his Family; and the Interest of the publick would be most highly consulted therein. Time improv'd well in our Callings is so much <HI>money</HI> got, so much <HI>work</HI> done, so much <HI>life</HI> gain'd. To lose our time then is to throw away our money and our life (not to say our Souls) and to injure the Common∣wealth, as well as our Families. But for want of a <HI>Market</HI> and <HI>Countryman</HI> or his servant loses much of his time from week to week, while he spends a <HI>whole day</HI> very often in the sale of those Goods, which in a Market he would sell in an <HI>hour</HI>; and so he might be home again before noon, and at work the other half of the day. A Market would make a quick dis∣patch for the Seller; for now tho' the Countryman brings the very things that I want, I know not where to go to find him, and so I sit suffering at home; while He if he knew I wanted it would not pass by my door, and traverse twenty Streets more in quest of a <HI>Chap.</HI> Besides, a Market being once settled and the Customs of it well understood, two or three Neighbours in the Country might agree by turns to bring one for another, and save one another a day or two at home
<PB N="4" REF="002019_0006_0FBA84BA047F2F20"/>
within the week; which what a mighty addition it would be to their life and work, and estate every one can compute.</P>
<P>But then the People of the <HI>Town</HI> would be as great Gainers in respect of <HI>Time</HI> by a Market, as the Coun∣tryman is. For how many hours of a Forenoon is now lost to many Families every week, while if a pig, or some poultry, or a little butter, or a few eggs be wanted for dinner, the <HI>Master</HI> of the House (forsooth) himself, or at least some Servant, must Out for the supply, they know not whither scarce, nor have they a certain place to go; but away they trapse toward the <HI>Neck,</HI> or half over to <HI>Roxbury</HI>; or it may be the <HI>Servant</HI> runs half over the Town, if indeed the <HI>idle Boy</HI> go not to play and come home with a lye, that he can't get any thing; when it may be he has never sought: So that in short, a Market would save the Towns people many an <HI>hour</HI> or two in a forenoon which is now utterly lost, and can be very ill spar'd in our Families. And sometimes those that spare the time with much regret, and had rather be at their work, yet are under some necessities thus to look out for sup∣plies: Whereas were there a Market to go to, at an appointed hour, they had better give a peny more in a shilling for the thing they want, than be taken off their work to go seek it.</P>
<P>And now that you may see how much the <HI>Vertue,</HI> as well as <HI>Estate</HI> of the Town and Country is served by this Redemption of time in our Families and at our Callings, I will go on into the Consideration of a <HI>second</HI> Benefit of a Market, and Mischief to us from the want of it; which follows upon the former, Namely,</P>
<P>A Market would promote <HI>Industry,</HI> and prevent a∣bundance of <HI>Idleness.</HI> Industry is of great Account to the temporal weal of any Country, and without it no land can flourish. Idleness is the parent of all Vice, Misery and Wretchedness to any people.</P>
<P>It is thought by <HI>Strangers</HI> who have observed the Industry of other places, that there is abundance of <HI>Idleness</HI> with us, and a manifest defect of Industry thro'
<PB N="5" REF="002019_0007_0FBA84BB4DB27458"/>
the Country. A <HI>Market</HI> would help to mend the mat∣ter, and herein would be not only so much <HI>Riches</HI> but so much <HI>Vertue</HI> to us. It would make people that bring things to market to do their <HI>best,</HI> and try to excel one another. Our <HI>Farmers</HI> would find a greater and quick∣er vent for their Provisions, and would soon contrive and take pains to bring more to us. Our good <HI>Dames</HI> in the Country would soon find that they that make the best butter, and send it to us in the neatest manner, would have the first sale and the best price; and so they that send their poultry the best fatted and the best dress'd; and the very <HI>Maids</HI> that come to market as well as their mistresses at home, would be ambitious to out-do their Neighbours, or at least not come behind them either in credit or profit. And the like is to be said of the Mutton, Veal or Pork which the Country dayly sends in; we should soon have much more of it, and much better fed and dress'd, and all to the Hus∣bandmans honour, and profit, and pleasure; whose Diligence and Industry only can yield him either.</P>
<P>We are now forc'd to live on the <HI>Butchers,</HI> for we know not whether else to send for our dayly supplies, tho' we should be glad of a little Change oftner than we have it, nor dare we trust our servants out very often upon the hunt after it: But had we a Market, the <HI>Countryman</HI> would find himself courted and encou∣raged to bring us more and more, and have ready money for all. This would set him upon using both his <HI>brains</HI> and his <HI>hands</HI> more than he generally does; and instead of a bare bringing about the <HI>Year,</HI> he wou'd with a little more care and labour make a great deal more <HI>gain.</HI></P>
<P>But then as to the <HI>prevention of Idleness among the servants</HI> both in Town and Country, a Market would manifestly be of great service. We dayly see many <HI>strong men</HI> that bring in Provisions, hawking and saun∣tring about Town (forgive me the courseness of the Expression) to find a sale, which to a stranger looks idle and loitering eno'; and tis a thousand pities that men so able to labour should saunter away the day so.
<PB N="6" REF="002019_0008_0FBA84BCA8B09870"/>
And as to the <HI>Children and Servants</HI> that are sent hither to sell things, they are in danger of idling and playing about the <HI>Town,</HI> and so of falling into ill hands and evil manners; and when they come home it is to be feared 'tis too often with a lye in their mouth, "that they made the best dispatch they cou'd, and could not meet with a buyer: Whereas were there a Market to carry their goods to, as they would ordi∣narily be soon sold, so this false pretence would be taken away, and the <HI>idling</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> prevented; the Master or Mistress being able to allow what time the sale and return would take.</P>
<P>And then to come to our <HI>Towns-people and Servants,</HI> as much Idleness would be prevented with us; the Mornings work in our Families would go on; our ser∣vants wou'd not be spoilt as they now are, nor our families distracted as they often are by their sloth and falshood. And so abundance of evil would be pre∣vented.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Another mischief and misery upon us from the want of a Market is the Oppression we are all un∣der, and especially the poor, by the <HI>Hucksters</HI> fore-stall∣ing, engrossing and buying up the Provision that comes into Town; which <HI>they</HI> buy almost at any rate, and then raise the price again as they please; for they know that many in the Neighbourhood must come to them, and more especially the <HI>poor</HI> must come with their <HI>pence</HI> to 'em, to whom they parcel out a cruel pittance; while in a Market the poor might buy more for their money, and escape the <HI>fatal temptation</HI> to them of running up∣on <HI>Tick.</HI></P>
<P>Another Benefit of a Market would be the <HI>Ease</HI> which both Town and Country would find in it; together with the <HI>Certainty</HI> of Sale to the Market-man, and a supply to the Town. Now we live at all adventures, and if we chance to meet with any thing, very well; but if the Servant return with his hands empty, and a down kind of look of famine, we must bear it patient∣ly, and yet it may be suspect his negligence and rogue∣ry: whereas had we a regular Market the Country and
<PB N="7" REF="002019_0009_0FBA84BF21CBE6B8"/>
Town both would know and keep their hour, go di∣rectly to their appointed place, be sure of Buyers and sure of a Supply ordinarily, of one sort or another, as soon as we come on the spot: and what an <HI>Ease</HI> would this be to every body. The present work of an hour or two would be done in as few minutes; and the pre∣sent Sale of half the day would be dispatched in half an hour. We might stand still and see the things done in a moment, which now we traverse the Town to ac∣complish.</P>
<P>Besides, If a Towns-man wants to speak with his <HI>Friend</HI> in the Country, or if he have any Bargain to propose to him, he knows when and where to meet him if there be stated Markets, or he can be at no loss to send to him: or if persons of distant Towns want to speak with one another, about any business or con∣cern whatsoever, they wou'd know where to meet with one another, at a certain hour: Which how much it will Expedite business, save time, and do a great deal of work with ease, the <HI>Reader</HI> need not be told.</P>
<P>Again, If the Farmer have quantities of <HI>Corn</HI> to sell, be it wheat or any other grain, have he some of the same sort better and some worse; how easy is it to take <HI>Samplers</HI> of it with him to the Market, and find Chaps, bargain and sell it all, and set the time of his delivery of it and for the receiving his money.</P>
<P>I will only add upon all that has been said, the <HI>Inde∣cency</HI> among us that has been occasioned by the want of a Market; first on the part of the <HI>Country-Man,</HI> who to my eye and ear debases himself while he trotts a∣bout the Town, crying at every Corner what he has to sell; whereas he would else go silently and gravely, and in a manner worthy of his Calling, <HI>of which,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>the King himself is served,</HI> to his appointed place, and unlade and return; And then again We should not see our very <HI>Gentry</HI> as well as <HI>Trades-men,</HI> travelling (as they are not <HI>ashamed</HI> now to do) to the Ends of the Town to get a little butter, or a few Eggs, for their Families; stooping to that which be∣comes their <HI>Maids</HI> rather in a Market: These un∣seemly
<PB N="8" REF="002019_0010_0FBA84C0EA75CFE0"/>
and <HI>sickly</HI> things, so much <HI>below</HI> the Country and the Town, can have no Remedy but by a <HI>Market</HI>; which would presently put us into Order, <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>beautifie</HI> us, and every way benefit us.</P>
<P>And now I come to consider the <HI>Objections</HI> that may be made against a Market: if indeed it be Imaginable there can be any made, to weigh against the fore-men∣tioned <HI>Benefits</HI> of one. But such as they are let us hear and answer 'em.</P>
<P>One main <HI>Objection,</HI> is already obviated in what has been said before, concerning the <HI>Ease</HI> which both Town and Country would find in a Market; for <HI>this</HI> answers the <HI>Market-man</HI> if he fears <HI>difficulties</HI> and <HI>troubles</HI> and <HI>disappointments</HI> on his part from a Market: If he be ready to say, "<HI>What shall I do with my Corn, supposing I bring any quantity of it and find no ready Sale for it? must I carry it back again, and bring it next time at the same uncertainty?</HI> The Answer is ready, as has been said before, The Farmer need only to bring a <HI>Sample</HI> of his Wheat or Barley or Rye with him; or if he bring it in bags and find no present Sale, 'tis but put∣ting it into some neighbouring Shop or Store, a Cour∣tesie which no body will deny him upon his asking it, till the next Market-day; and where probably it will be seen, and some will be ready to buy it at his return; or he leaving his price he may find it sold and his money receiv'd for him. So that this is no Objection.</P>
<P>In the next place;</P>
<P>It can scarce be supposed that any will think this comely and useful Order can be <HI>a breach upon their na∣tural rights and liberties:</HI> But if any should say, "<HI>We won't be ty'd up, we will go where we will, and sell how we will</HI>; it were easy to answer 'em, — That there is no liberty or freedom like that which we find under good Laws and Rules, and wise limitations, for the mutual and common Benefit of our selves and our Neighbours. They that will be lawless and disorder∣ly are sure to be in Bondage and misery: and they only who come into Order can live free and easie. Besides that every Town has the right &amp; power to make <HI>By Laws</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002019_0011_0FBA84C2A4BD4600"/>
and six necessary rules for it self; to which it may re∣quire every one to submit, whether he be an Inhabitant, or he that comes there to traffick. All must yeild to what is legally judged to be for the good Order and benefit of the place.</P>
<P>It may be some particular <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>families</HI> may say, "<HI>We are better supply'd than we are like to be by a Mar∣ket, for we have a sure Country friend who brings us all that we need, and we are not so much as at the trouble of going out of doors for it.</HI> But how easy is it to answer and shame this <HI>little private</HI> and <HI>narrow</HI> Spirit by say∣ing, 'That the <HI>Publick</HI> ought to take an equal care of every body, and to have every body's first regard; "that if some are so easily and fully supply'd while o∣thers suffer and are straitned, then it behoves the <HI>Town</HI> to come into more equal and easie measures for all; "that we ought to <HI>deny our selves</HI> for the general good, be content to take our lot, and with our Neighbours fare;" that a Market is a more <HI>lasting</HI> supply, and con∣sults for our <HI>Posterity</HI> and future times; Whereas by this <HI>Objection</HI> we only consider our own <HI>dear selves,</HI> for the <HI>present day,</HI> to the Injury of the <HI>Publick,</HI> and of our Children after us. But at last it must be said, that no person or Family can be so surely supply'd in this <HI>pri∣vate</HI> way and manner, as in the more publick one of a <HI>Market</HI>: For your <HI>friend</HI> may <HI>die</HI> and you must be to seek for a new one, and may be at a loss where to get one; but a Market once set up is a <HI>living</HI> and certain supply that will outlive us, and provide for them that shall come after us.</P>
<P>Again it is said, <HI>We have try'd once and could do nothing about the setting up of a Market:</HI> It was all <HI>Confusion,</HI> and People were ready almost to fall toge∣ther by the ears.</P>
<P>The Answer is, That we should have begun sooner. It had been far easier in our Beginning. All places find it hard to alter and break <HI>ill Customs,</HI> how manifest soever they be. The thing must be gone about with the more caution, wisdom and prudence. We must expect <HI>difficulties</HI> and some <HI>disorders</HI> it may be at the
<PB N="10" REF="002019_0012_0FBA84C6B690B060"/>
first; but time and experience will every day mend the matter. We must not give over what we need and what will be so beneficial, for an ill beginning, if such there was, or for a want of success at first. <HI>Markets</HI> must be some time or other. We can't live always in this disorder, and after the present wild rate. Let us therefore attempt and try again: A good and needful thing must be pursued.</P>
<P>But will any say, "<HI>What are we better than our Fa∣thers? they did without a Market, and why can't we? they did not see one so needful, and are we wiser than they?</HI> I answer, Our <HI>Fathers</HI> were wise and good Men, and we are happy in their early Cares for us in many <HI>greater</HI> and more important Interests than this of <HI>Markets.</HI> They set up <HI>Schools, Colleges</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> and no Markets. And they are justifyed of their Children in their first and better Care for us. But then their Successors should not have left the other undone. <HI>The Children of this world are wiser in their Generation.</HI> In things that belong to the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Political Life,</HI> let us hearken to <HI>them.</HI> Nor let it seem to us a reflecti∣on on our <HI>Fathers</HI> if we should say, that they were not quite enough Men of this world for us: or that they took so much care of our Minds and our Immortality, that they were a little too Negligent of these mortal Bodies. Be it so, that such a charge might be hence drawn, which I do not think can be justly done; yet <HI>forgive 'em this wrong</HI>; doubtless on the best Accounts they will be <HI>had in Honour.</HI> But indeed the neglect of this comfortable provision of Markets for us, is not to be charged upon the <HI>first Generation</HI> who had eno' to do to lay the foundation of our <HI>Towns</HI>; the fault lies upon their <HI>increased Posterity,</HI> that they have not timely come into these good Orders. We have <HI>enter'd</HI> into their labours, but have not <HI>improv'd</HI> upon them as we ought to have done; neither on temporal Accounts nor on spiritual.</P>
<P>However some will say, <HI>That to be sure it is not the time now to set up Markets; the proposal is now more out of season than ever it was: provisions are dear, and
<PB N="11" REF="002019_0013_0FBA84C8CB72ADE8"/>
money is scarce; we must stay 'till there be more plenty of both.</HI></P>
<P>And it must be acknowledged that there is some reason in the <HI>Objection.</HI> The dearness of Provision and scarcity of Money, are great disadvantages. And if the staying a year or two would mend the matter, it might be worth the while. But there is no pretence of that. Possibly a <HI>Market</HI> would help to enliven us, and quick∣en Business and Industry among us; and so may con∣tribute to mend the times. But as for our <HI>Money,</HI> what suffices to buy us provisions <HI>now</HI> will serve us at the Markets. And it will be cheaper for us too to carry our few pence to the <HI>Market</HI> from time to time, than to run up a score at the <HI>Huksters,</HI> and lose a peny or two in every shilling.</P>
<P>Well but <HI>won't a Market either raise or lower the pri∣ces of Provisions to the publick Detriment?</HI> if the <HI>first</HI> the <HI>Town</HI> will suffer by it, and if the <HI>latter</HI> 'twill da∣mage the <HI>Country-man.</HI> But I suppose it can do <HI>neither</HI> to any great degree. If it should <HI>abate</HI> some of the price of Provisions it were a thing greatly to be desired. And now indeed we of the Town <HI>raise</HI> the price upon our selves by going to the Towns End, and buying up. Some Market people have professed that they never intended to ask, what people have sometimes come and bid for their goods. But if there should not be a sufficient Supply for a Market, it is probable this Evil would not be remedied; nay the price of Provisi∣ons wou'd yet rise by peoples bidding upon one another. What we hope for is, <HI>that there would be a moderate &amp; sufficient Supply,</HI> and then the Country will still have a moderate and sufficient Gain; and if they are quick∣ned to raise more than they now do, they will gain a great deal more, tho' the price be lower.</P>
<P>But now comes the <HI>greatest Objection</HI> of all in my Account, and that is — <HI>Our people live so high and are so free of their little Money</HI> (not to say <HI>prodigal</HI> of it) <HI>that a Market will never be able to supply Us: Every one is so much for the best and dearest, and some for every thing, and for a great deal of every sort.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002019_0014_0FBA84CA29F23090"/>Now this I confess is a <HI>formidable</HI> Objection, but too foolish and criminal a thing I should hope to be <HI>true.</HI> Yet they say <HI>it was found so</HI> when the Market was heretofore attempted, and some <HI>discreet Persons</HI> tell me 'twas this <HI>spoilt</HI> the attempt then, And so it will for ever if it be not corrected and amended. It is a vicious Extravagancy and Enormity, which we must reform in our selves. We must be <HI>modest, humble, frugal,</HI> and every one content themselves with a <HI>little,</HI> a <HI>bare supply</HI> for the time. <HI>Put the knife to thy throat,</HI> and cut that rather than murder the Publick. Nature is content with a little, and prudence will make a little go far, but nothing will satisfy lust, and therefore it must needs be mortifyed, and die as a publick Enemy.</P>
<P>They that are poorer in worldly state should and must give way to the <HI>Rich.</HI> Who but <HI>they</HI> ordinarily should buy the dearest and best of the kind? <HI>Providence</HI> means it for them. It is the Government of <HI>Heaven</HI>; let us submit to it. GOD has given into their hand more abundantly. <HI>Let not thine Eye be evil.</HI> Now &amp; then <HI>we that are poorer</HI> may tast of the best too and be thankful, But we should be willing to live low, where God has set us; and <HI>having food and raiment</HI> (tho' not so much of it as some, nor of so fine a sort) <HI>let us be therewith content.</HI></P>
<P>Would to God there were <HI>Manna</HI> and <HI>Quails</HI> for the meanest! But that would be to suppose a <HI>Wilderness-state,</HI> where there were no fields to plant or reap. We look now to live by the Blessing of God on our labour and frugality, and not by <HI>Miracles.</HI> These ceas'd as soon as <HI>Israel</HI> came to Cities and Villages, to inhabit and till and Trade.</P>
<P>Finally, If any should object again, <HI>We have no pla∣ces in the Town now left for Markets, except in the Out-places:</HI> We are every where inclosed and shut up, so that it would cumber the <HI>Shops,</HI> and obstruct the ne∣cessary passage of Carts and Trucks, in the work and Merchandize of the Town from day to day.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002019_0015_0FBA84CDC44E99A0"/>In the first place I would <HI>answer,</HI> that happy may the <HI>Shops</HI> account themselves where the Markets shall be seated, for it is likely to bring them good trade, and proportionably would the rents of the Houses so scituated rise.</P>
<P>And then as to <HI>places for Markets,</HI> as the <HI>South</HI> End of the Town cannot want one if we please to provide one there; So the <HI>North</HI> End have the <HI>fair Square be∣fore the Old Church</HI> there, to which might be added the fair <HI>Slip</HI> of Ground behind it if the Town please to purchase it: And as to the middle of the Town, if the <HI>Dock</HI> were but filled up even with the fine <HI>Wharf</HI> which is already built out into it, and those wretched old Houses which now pinch up the way were pulled down, it would afford <HI>a most pleasant and spacious place</HI> for a Market, to the great Beauty and utmost Convenience of the <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed this <HI>Proposal</HI> supposes both Charge and some private Persons submitting their Interests to the pub∣lick; but these things can never be avoided nor are to be objected: We must always be at <HI>pains</HI> and <HI>cost</HI> too to make our selves easie and comfortabe, and to provide for our Necessities and Conveniences.</P>
<P>Having thus offer'd my good Wishes and poor Thoughts to the <HI>Town</HI> in the particular now before me, I ask for a candid Interpretation, or (if I deserve it) a gentle Censure and forgiveness. I can only plead an honest meaning at the general Advantage of the <HI>whole Town and Country</HI> in this Essay. It may be I should use the Market as little as most of my Neighbours, if it be set up. But if my <HI>Betters</HI> are served by it, together with the <HI>poorest,</HI> I shall be glad to have contributed any way to the ease and Comfort both of the <HI>One</HI> and the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>I will take leave of the <HI>Reader</HI> by obliging him with some better words than my own, <HI>Scil.</HI></P>
<P><Q>That it has always been a Maxim with <HI>Infant</HI> Cities and Towns, when they are grown to sufficient

numbers to follow those <HI>laudable Customs</HI> and practi∣ces, from which more <HI>Ancient</HI> and consequently <HI>wiser</HI> Cities and Towns have reaped their greatest Benefits and Advantages: Among which <HI>Customs</HI> it is noto∣rious that none has been more universally pursued, thro' the whole World, than the appointing proper times and places in their respective Cities and Towns for an orderly and well govern'd <HI>Market</HI>; by which means their Inhabitants both poor and rich have been well Supply'd, and the Country-farmers and good Housewives found a gainful Account.</Q></P>
