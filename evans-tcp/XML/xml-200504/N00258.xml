<L>GReat God, how short's man's time; each minute speaks</L>
<L>He is but dust, and that his Vessel leaks.</L>
<L>Each moment of my momentany time,</L>
<L>Does plainly tell me 'tis not mine, but Thine.</L>
<L>He gives me time to live, and verily</L>
<L>Ere long I shall have likewise time to dye.</L>

<L>After the time of Life is ended, then</L>

<L>A great <HI>ETERNITY</HI> will surely come,</L>
<L>Of blessed Happiness, or cursed Doom.</L>
<L>Lord, grant I may be one of those that may</L>

<L>Down to the Grave I must e're long descend,</L>
<L>Leave all my friends behind; thither <HI>I</HI> bend</L>
<L>And steer my wearied Course unto that Port,</L>

<L>This World a Sea of trouble is, and Man</L>
<L>Is swimming through this vast wide Ocean.</L>
<L>The Billows beat, the Waves are angry, and</L>
<L>'Tis seldom that he spies a helping hand</L>
<L>To Buoy his head up, O great God, let me</L>

<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 5.</HEAD>
<L>I can but die but once, why should I fear?</L>
<L>Whether I fear or not, 'tis all as near.</L>
<L>O but my Soul, consider that sad time</L>
<L>Gives every thing to death, leaves nothing thine.</L>
<L>Except thy stinking Carcase, which shall be</L>
<L>Dispos'd to weal or woe eternallie.</L>

<L>The Passing-Bell sounds harsh unto the ear</L>
<L>Of all that do the <HI>King of Terrours</HI> fear.</L>
<L>But let a man have but an interest</L>
<L>In <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> 'twill toll him to his rest.</L>
<L>Lord, give me such a gift, none other I</L>
<L>Crave or desire, whether I live or die.</L>

<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 7.</HEAD>
<L>Death puts an end to every thing below,</L>
<L>It gives the killing wound, the fatal blow.</L>
<L>Of those that here a while did but reside,</L>
<L>But for a time, the last act is, <HI>They dy'd.</HI></L>
<L>Then grant, O Lord, that I may act this Part</L>
<L>Well on the Stage; then Death, lo here's my Heart.</L>

<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 8.</HEAD>
<L>Scarce do I pass a day, but that I hear</L>
<L>Some one or other's dead; and to my ear</L>
<L>Methinks it is no news: but Oh! did I</L>
<L>Think deeply on it, what it is to die.</L>
<L>My Pulses all would beat, I should not be</L>
<L>Drown'd in this Deluge of Securitie.</L>
</LG>

<L>Think every day thy last, and ready be;</L>
<L>And so th'uncertain hour shall welcome thee.</L>

<L>Man's life is like a Rose, that in the Spring</L>
<L>Begins to blossome, fragrant smells to bring;</L>
<L>Within a day or two, behold Death's sent,</L>

<L>Alas, what is the <HI>World</HI>? a Sea of Glass.</L>

<L>The Sea dissolves; the Glass is quickly run;</L>

<L>Had I as many days to live, as I</L>

<L>Each day a drop, would carry away a day;</L>

<L>I every day do see that here below</L>

<L>Friends and Relations, every thing that I</L>

<L>Give me a portion then even in that place,</L>
<L>Where still I may behold thy blessed face.</L>

<L>How often have I view'd the graves, and gone</L>
<L>Unto that place, and yet returned home</L>
<L>Again unto my house: The time will bee</L>

<L>Both Young and Old, no Sex is spar'd; Oh why?</L>
<L>What is the cause of our Mortality?</L>
<L>Lo here it is; a blessed God we have</L>

<L>Death strikes the Young man, and the Old man must</L>
<L>Yield to Death's stroke, and return to the dust:</L>
<L>Nor Strength, nor Beauty, Riches, Honours, lent</L>

<L>Man's life it is but lent him here, and he</L>

<L>Those fading Comforts that below we have</L>
<L>Or do enjoy, will leave us at the grave.</L>
<L>Lord, grant that when my Comforts all are gone▪</L>

The third day.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 49.</HEAD>
<L>In Heaven are eternal joyes; and sure</L>
<L>In that place there are Remedies to cure</L>
<L>Our here Sin-sick'ned Souls: but Oh shall I</L>
<L>Be made a Patient of this Remedy?</L>
<L>Lord, I believe a Heaven there is; but this</L>
<L>The Question is, <HI>Shall I enjoy that bliss</HI>?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 50.</HEAD>
<L>In Hell are Torments, Torments without end;</L>
<L>And them I must endute, if that no friend</L>
<L>I have of JESUS. O my Soul, must I</L>
<L>Go from <HI>PAIN</HI> here, to Pain eternally?</L>
<L>I know there is a Hell: Lord, grant that I</L>
<L>May go from Earth to Heaven when I die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 51.</HEAD>
<L>My Soul tell me, Are there not many that</L>
<L>Do wish for Heaven, and yet miss the Gate?</L>
<L>How many do (with <HI>Balaam</HI>) wish that they</L>
<L>May depart like a Saint at dying day?</L>
<L>Lord, let me to be like them here desire,</L>
<L>Upon this earth, as when they do expire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 52.</HEAD>
<L>How many are there that may take their harps</L>
<L>And hang upon the willows; mournful hearts</L>
<L>Would best become such as must go from hence,</L>
<L>And then in Hell have lasting residence.</L>
<L>O Lord, how little do I think on this,</L>
<L>That I may be one that may miss of Bliss?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I am (I see) still Mercies Monument;</L>
<L>For more, one day is still unto me lent.</L>

<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 53.</HEAD>
<L>How often should we think of this, that we</L>
<L>Must ere long yield to Death's supremacie?</L>
<L>The time ere long will come, when we shall be</L>
<L>No more; and shortly we no time shall see.</L>
<L>O that I might be then prepar'd for this</L>
<L>So great a Change, and be receiv'd to bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 54</HEAD>
<L>The sons of men are prone to forget Death,</L>
<L>And put it farre away from them, till breath</L>
<L>Begins to tell them they must to the grave;</L>
<L>And then, Oh what would they give but to have</L>
<L>One year of respite? Help me, Lord, to know</L>
<L>As I move here, so my time moves also.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 55.</HEAD>
<L>Whilst we live here, we have the blessed voice</L>
<L>Of God by Ministers, the blessed noise</L>
<L>And sound of <HI>Aarons</HI> Bells: the time will be</L>
<L>When we no more of this shall hear or see.</L>
<L>Help, Lord, that <HI>I</HI> may then improve the same</L>
<L>Unto the praise and glory of thy Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 56.</HEAD>
<L>The time will be, when we shall be <HI>No more</HI>:</L>
<L>Where will the World be then? 'Twill be <HI>No more.</HI></L>
<L>Where will our Comforts be? They'll be <HI>No more.</HI></L>
<L>Where will our Friends be then? They'll be <HI>No more.</HI></L>
<L>Lord, grant me then thy grace, lest that <HI>No more</HI></L>
<L>Do seize upon me, and I be <HI>No more.</HI></L>

The <HI>5</HI>th day.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 57.</HEAD>
<L>How tremblingly do creatures here appear</L>
<L>Before an earthly Judge? what dreadful fear</L>
<L>Does seiz upon them at the Bar of him,</L>
<L>Who likewise must arraigned be for sin?</L>
<L>Lord, grant me here thy grace, and so may I</L>
<L>With joy at last behold thy Majesty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 58.</HEAD>
<L>The day of death's a coming; after that</L>
<L>A day of Judgment will discriminate,</L>
<L>And put a difference 'twixt the Saints and those</L>
<L>Who do Gods Wayes and Precepts here oppose.</L>
<L>Lord, let me be prepared for that day,</L>
<L>That so with joy (Lord) thee behold I may.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 59</HEAD>
<L>The hand of death strikes sure, there's nothing can</L>
<L>Obstruct, or hinder it; and every man,</L>
<L>Whether he will or no, must know that he</L>
<L>Must into dust most surely turned be.</L>
<L>O how should I prepare for this since 'tis</L>
<L>So sure and certain which I cannot miss.</L>

<LG>
<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 60.</HEAD>
<L>Death is a surly Sergeant, no respect</L>
<L>Hath he to persons, does their tears reject;</L>
<L>No bribe will blind his eyes, away we must,</L>
<L>If he but call, and return to the dust.</L>
<L>Lord, grant that I may death behold with joy,</L>
<L>And to my soul let it bring no annoy.</L>

<L>Each minute gives my time a shorter time:</L>
<L>Not to prepare for Death is a sad crime.</L>

<L>There's nothing that I do, or act, but sayes</L>

<L>Each day speaks to me, and gives me to know,</L>

<L>How is it that I am so careless here,</L>

<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 63.</HEAD>
<L>Lord, what's the reason I'm so loth to hear</L>
<L>Of the great day of Death? what means this fear,</L>
<L>That at the thoughts of death o're-spreads me, and</L>
<L>Prompts me to give a willing Countermand?</L>
<L>Jesus, 'tis to be fear'd I never stood</L>

<HEAD><HI>Meditation</HI> 64</HEAD>
<L>What makes the Saints on earth desire to be</L>
<L>Dissolved, and that blessed day to see?</L>
<L>What makes them whilst they're here below to groan</L>
<L>Against this body of Corruption?</L>
<L>Lord, they know not when they from hence do go,</L>
<L>On them a glorious Kingdom thou'lt bestow.</L>
