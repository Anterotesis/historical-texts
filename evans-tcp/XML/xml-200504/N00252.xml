<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning those admirable; and amazing works of God, which are by us called <HI>Comets,</HI> as under a <HI>Physical</HI> and <HI>Mathema∣tical</HI> Consideration, there are many that have published their Sentiments, and some to good purpose and edification. The scope of the ensuing discourse, is only (that being most pro∣per for one under my circumstances) to make a <HI>Theo∣logical</HI> Improvement thereof. There are that do pro∣pound this inquiry, <HI>How many Comets hath the world taken notice of since the first Creation?</HI> Which is indeed a Question that no mortal living is able to give a full and certain answer unto. It is true that sundry learned and worthy Writers (especiall <HI>Lavater</HI> and <HI>Alsted</HI>) have attempted to give us the History of <HI>Comets,</HI> nor hath their labour been wholly in vain or unprofitable. In the Authors but now mentioned (though others give us a larger account) We do not read of above eleven <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> in those Ages (for about four thousand years) that were before the Incarnation of the Son of God: Doubtless there were more; but the Records of those times are very imperfect, so that we cannot say, when they appeared, or by whom observed. The number of <HI>Comets</HI> seen these last 1680. years, is judged to be about 158. Some speak of a farr greater number, but oth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s question whether there have been so many, inasmuc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as diverse appearances of the same

<HI>Comet</HI> have been set down by Historians as if they had been so many distinct <HI>Comets</HI>▪ Such <HI>Stars</HI> (for so ra∣ther than <HI>Meteors</HI> have the Observations of later times evinced them to be) have ever been accounted <HI>Omi∣nous Presages</HI> of great mutations and miseryes coming upon the world. So did the wise men amongst the Gentiles of old <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Ab ultima antiquitatis memoria notatum est Cometas semper calamitatum praenuncios fuisse.</HI> <BIBL>Cicer. <HI>de nat.

And the observation hath been sadly verified, by the experience of latter Ages; con∣sonant to the holy Scriptures of Truth, where (both in the Old Testament and in the New) Prodigious Sights and Signs in the heavens are mentioned as the presages of great Calamityes. Some object that after the blaz∣ing Star, Anno, 1097. A very fertile prosperous year followed, but they forget that the next ye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a direful Plague raged in the World. Others object that <HI>Wick∣liffs</HI> and <HI>Luthers</HI> Reformations, had <HI>Comets</HI> to procede them. But (to say nothing of the Warrs and fatal changes which in those dayes hapned in diverse parts of the World) two or three exceptions do not invalidate the truth of a general Assertion. If such signs are com∣monly Presages of sore Calamityes, that's enough to awaken men out of their Lethargyes, though now and then, once in an hundred times it should happen to be otherwayes, which yet remains to be demonstrated. As for their notion who think that <HI>Comets</HI> are signs that
<PB REF="000320_0004_0FA4AED8C877F800"/>
the light of the Gospel shall be further dispersed in the world, or that they portend mercy to the Church, and Judgement to others only; it is to be wished that there were a solid foundation for such a conceipt: But alas▪ Divisions amongst the Lord's professing People themselves, and great Persecutions have oftentimes been the fatal consequents of such portentous signs. And if publick calamities come upon the world, it is not to be expected but that the Lord's People, whilst they are mixed amongst others (and too much partak∣ing with them in their sins) living in an evil world, will have their share therein. It hath ever been so, and is ever like to be so, until <HI>the sign of the Son of Man ap∣pear.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Blazing Star,</HI> which hath occasioned this present Discourse, it was a terrible sight indeed, espe∣cially about the middle of <HI>December</HI> last, the stream of such a stupendous magnitude, as that few men now living ever beheld the like. That in the year, 1618. was looked upon as very prodigious <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>History of great Brittain,</HI> Pag. 128. Clark's <HI>Example, Vol.</HI> 2. p. 256.</NOTE> yet the ra∣diant Locks of it were not at first though at last extended above 45. degrees in length, whenas this was about 60. degrees. Yet I cannot say there never was any so dismal since the world began, for I have read of diverse no less <HI>fear∣full. Seneca</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nat. Quest.</HI> Lib. 7. C. 15, 16.</NOTE> speaketh of a <HI>Comet</HI> whose magnitude was equal with that of the Sun: And of ano∣ther that prodigiously diffused it self over the <HI>Via lactea</HI>; and of another very formidable, after which <HI>Helice</HI> and <HI>Buris,</HI> Cityes in <HI>Achaiae</HI> perished by a fearful Inun∣dation. That which appeared Anno Christi, 1452. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Teste</HI> Nau∣clero.</NOTE> was above 50. degrees in length. Writers speak of some
<PB REF="000320_0005_0FA4AED97762F098"/>
<HI>Blazing Star</HI> that hath been attended with a much lon∣ger stream; Yea, of one that was 90. and another that was 130. degrees. Nevertheless, one so fearful to behold as this, hath rarely been known: And with∣out controversie some great thing is portended there∣by. I see little reason to conclude, that it is an <HI>Omen</HI> of happy dayes to the world untill God hath made way for mercy by great Judgements. Especially consider∣ing, that we are fallen into the dregs of time, wherein the dayes must and shall be perilous. It was long since <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Keckerm.

<P><HI>Magius de exusti∣one Mundi. l.</HI> 3. c. 10.</P></NOTE> conjectured, that in the Ages more immediatly preceding the day of Judgement, <HI>Comets</HI> and o∣ther <HI>fearful Sights</HI> should be more frequent than formerly, as intima∣tions of the great and amazing Revolutions in those Ages to be accomplished. It will not be long before the second Wo Trumpet hath done its work, and then the third Wo will come quickly. The Lord grant that we may be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of Man at His coming.</P>
<P>The learned and judicious <HI>Hos∣pinian</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>De Origine templorum.</HI> p. 59.</NOTE> writes that Anno, 729.

is a coming.</HI> Further then this I would not go a∣bout to <HI>determine</HI>; only we may modestly <HI>conjecture</HI> as to particular events like to happen. I have ever thought it unwarrantable, for men, not acted by an extraordinary Spirit, to make particular and positive determinations concerning the Judgements (or the Persons eminently concerned therein) by such Prodi∣gies menaced. The great <HI>Melancthon</HI> hath been thought (by some great <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Voetius in Disp. de Sign.</HI></NOTE> Authors) to proceed something too far in ap∣plications of this nature. <HI>Peucerus (Melancthon</HI>'s Son in Law) ex∣presseth himself more warily, in his <HI>Teratoscopia,</HI> or Discourse about <HI>Divination from fearful Sights.</HI> Yet he affirms that when ever great changes in the world have been near, prodigious Sights have been the forerun∣ners thereof; and that unusual Sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are seldom or never known to have hapned without great and mise∣serable changes attending them. Only it is possible for particular Persons and places through faith in Christ, and in a way of humble Repentance, to obtain a lengthening out of their tranquility. The Gentiles of old <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Alexand.</HI> ab <HI>Alex.</HI> l. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. c. 27. <HI>Coelius Rodogi.</HI> l. 3. c. 27.</NOTE> when they beheld <HI>fear∣full Sights in Heaven,</HI> would present∣ly betake themselves to their Prayers and Piacular Sacrifices (in imitation of whom idolatrous Papists have been wont in like cases to go to their Re∣liques, Amulets, Processions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) that so evils <HI>Omi∣nated</HI> thereby, might (if possible) be averted. And shall not Professours of the true Religion, be awaken∣ed by such awful works of God, to go unto Jesus Christ (our only Sacrifice) and to pray earnestly that impen∣ding wrath may be removed, and the mercy of Heaven obtained? Shall we not be humbled, as for other Sins, so for that, of not hearkning to His VVord? The con∣tempt

The Lord is many wayes cal∣ling upon men, to repent, and pray, and get into the Ark before the Flood come.

<P>THE Lord Jesus Christ, ha∣ving told his Disciples that great Calamityes were hastning upon Je∣rusalem, and upon the Jewish Nation; they enquire when those things should come to pass, and what <HI>Signs</HI> should precede and presage the
<PB N="2" REF="000320_0009_0FA4AEE01546ABA8"/>
Judgements predicted. This we see in the 7<HI>th.</HI> Verse of this Chapter, <HI>They asked Him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be: and what</HI> Sign <HI>will there be when these things shall come to pass</HI>? In Answer unto which Enquiry, the Lord Christ doth in this Context mention several things, some of which were to be more remote, and others more immediate <HI>Signs</HI> of that miserable Destruction, which the sacred and unerring lips of Christ had foretold. 1. False Christs would arise, <HI>V.</HI> 8. <HI>Many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ,</HI> &amp;c. The Jews had rejected the true Messiah, therefore God would punish them with false Christs, as an inti∣mation that the dayes of vengeance were coming upon the Nation for that Sin of theirs. The Apostle <HI>John</HI> (Christ's be∣loved Disciple) doth imitate his Master in mentioning the same thing as a Sign that the Jewish World was near unto its end, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.18. <HI>There are many Anti∣christs</HI> b <HI>h. e.</HI> false Christs, such as came <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mede<HI>'s Works, I.</HI> 818, 872.</NOTE> in Christ's
<PB N="3" REF="000320_0010_0FA4AEE03A71E230"/>
Name, <HI>i. e.</HI> that pretended unto his Office, Dignity, and Authority; and thereby, (saith the Apostle,) <HI>we know that it is the last time</HI>; sc. the Jewish State, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, was come unto the last hour: The Period of the Jewish World was at hand. And the Historyes of those times speak of one <HI>Theudas,</HI> and others, that pretended to be Christs, and that the River <HI>Jordan</HI> should give way to them as once it did to <HI>Joshuah</HI>; so that a multi∣tude of silly Jews were seduced, &amp; perswa∣ded to follow them, unto their own destru∣ction. 2. Another Sign mentioned, is that of Warres, and Commotions, <HI>V.</HI> 9. <HI>When you shall hear of Wars and Commoti∣ons, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by &amp; by.</HI> This may be understood of those <HI>Intestine</HI> Warres and <HI>Commotions,</HI> which hapned in the Land of <HI>Judea.</HI> The <HI>Galileans</HI> took up Arms against the <HI>Samaritans.</HI> At <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Joseph. <HI>Antiq.

<PB N="4" REF="000320_0011_0FA4AEE0E70457A0"/>
great noise and consternation amongst men (especially amongst those of the Jewish Nation) in those dayes. Hence that which is by <HI>Luke</HI> expressed by <HI>Wars</HI> and <HI>Commotions,</HI> is by <HI>Mark</HI> called <HI>Trou∣bles</HI>; and by <HI>Matthew, Wars and Rumors of Wars.</HI> And these things hapned about twenty years before the final destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and fatal overthrow of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation; therefore was it said, <HI>The end is not by and by.</HI> 3. Another Sign is that mentioned in the 10<HI>th. V. Nation shall rise up against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Joseph. <HI>de Bello</HI> Judaico. <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 19.20, 21.</NOTE> So indeed it came to pass, when the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation rose up against the <HI>Romane</HI> Nation; and their Neighbouring Nations, <HI>Syrians, Sa∣maritans,</HI> &amp;c. rose against them. In those dayes the Land of <HI>Judea</HI> was divided into several Provinces, which did bear the names of <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> and the chief Gover∣nours of them are according to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Style, called <HI>Kings,</HI> being the Vice-Roys which the <HI>Romane</HI> Emperours did substi∣tute
<PB N="5" REF="000320_0012_0FA4AEE52DDC5B40"/>
to be over those places.. See 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22.47. Hence we read of King <HI>Herod,</HI> King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Grotius, <HI>&amp;</HI> Lu∣cas Brugensis <HI>in</HI> Matth. 24.7.</NOTE> Now the people of these Pro∣vinces were set one against another; therefore it is said, <HI>Kingdom shal rise up against Kingdom.</HI> All these trou∣bles were forerunners and Intimations of the fatal Calamity a coming, and did help to make way thereunto. 4. There were to be <HI>great Earth-Quakes in divers Places.</HI> In the beginning of this Verse. Such things are usually signs of Divine Anger, and so portentous of great Changes and Calamityes: the Intimations of State-Quakes, yea of Nation-Quakes.

several famous Cities perished, not long before <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was destroyed. 5. <HI>Fa∣mines.</HI> Probably that Prediction doth respect the same Famine which <HI>Agabus</HI> prophesied of, <HI>Act.</HI> 11.28. Under which the Land of <HI>Judea</HI> suffered deeply. Whence it was that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was very sollicitous to obtain some Relief for the Christian <HI>Jews</HI> then at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> 6. <HI>Pestilences.</HI> These two Judgements, (<HI>Li∣moi kai Loimoi,</HI> as in the <HI>Greek</HI> it is ele∣gantly expressed) of <HI>Famine, and Pesti∣lence,</HI> do often go together, the latter fol∣lowing at the heels of the former, and be∣ing occasioned thereby. 7. <HI>Fearful Sights and great Signs in Heaven:</HI> which are the words now before us to consider of. Fearful Sights] <HI>Gr. Phobetra [Terri∣culamenta:]</HI> Such Sights as strike a terror into the hearts of men that are the Specta∣tors of them. <HI>Signs from Heaven] viz.</HI> Prodigious Signs.

<P><PB N="7" REF="000320_0014_0FA4AEE9A493B560"/><HI>Doct.</HI> That Prodigious awful Sights and Signs in Heaven, are oftentimes, the Presages of great Calamity coming upon the World.</P>
<P>For the further clearing of this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into. 1. What Sights and Signs are the Presages of Calamity? 2. How it doth appear that they are so? 3. What Calamityes such Signs do commonly presage?</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>What Sights and Signs in Heaven are Presages of Calamity?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. There are Signs in the <HI>starry Heaven.</HI> The great God, when he made the World, placed the Stars in Heaven, to be for Signs as to Events that in the ordi∣nary Course of Nature should come to pass. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.14. <HI>God said, Let there be lights in the Firmament of heaven, and let them be for Signs.</HI> They are for Signs of Heat and Cold, wet and dry Seasons, and the like. Hence the Lord spake to <HI>Job,</HI> as in Ch. 38.31. <HI>Canst thou bind the sweet Influences of</HI> Pleiades, <HI>or loose the bands of</HI> Orion? The <HI>Pleiades</HI> are the same with
<PB N="8" REF="000320_0015_0FA4AEE9F466A088"/>
those which men call the <HI>Seven Starres.</HI> When the Sun is in that Constellation with the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> it hath great power and Influence upon the Earth. It is Spring∣time then. As for <HI>Orion</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Caryl <HI>on</HI> Job, 38.31.</NOTE> it is a Winter-Constellation, causing Cold, whereby the pores of the earth are bound. It binds the Earth from bearing Fruit, and as it were binds the hands of Men from labour in their particular Callings. When that Con∣stellation appears in the Evening (as it doth in the ninth Moneth) 'tis a sign that the Earth shall be bound, as hath bin expressed. Yea, and it is a sign that Storms and tempestuous seasons are to be expected. Therefore was it by the Poet called <HI>Nimbosus Orion.</HI> And hence the Stars are called by the name of the <HI>Signs of heaven,</HI> Jer. 10.2. <HI>Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the Signs of heaven.</HI> Which words may well be un∣derstood concerning the Stars and Con∣stellations in the heavens. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Ita locum interpretantur Rab. <HI>Solomon Jarchi,</HI> &amp; exillo <HI>Lyranus.</HI></P>

<PB N="9" REF="000320_0016_0FA4AEEABAD3E020"/>
the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> especially (among whom the <HI>Jews</HI> were then going to dwell) superstitiously imagin'd that the Stars were Rulers of the World, and did there∣fore stand in fear of them, and worship them; which heathenish Idolatry the Lord doth caution and charge his People against. The Stars of Heaven are for na∣tural Signs. Their Motions and Appea∣rances are significations that such and such things, will according to that Course of Nature which God hath setled, come to pass in the World. There are also <HI>ex∣traordinary Stars,</HI> sometimes appearing in the Heavens. God in his Providence doth so order, as that sometimes, <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> are seen in heaven. Such <HI>Stars</HI> are called <HI>Comets,</HI> from the stream like long Hair, which useth to attend them. Such a Star is <HI>Prodigious,</HI> and a <HI>Fearful Sight.</HI> And of this may the words of the Text be un∣derstood. The <HI>Jewish</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Warres of Jews, <HI>l</HI> 7. <HI>c</HI> 12</NOTE> Historian re∣ports, that not long before the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there was a <HI>Blazing Starre</HI> in
<PB N="10" REF="000320_0017_0FA4AEEB83119D30"/>
form of a Sword, which seemed to im∣pend over the City, for a Year together: This now was a <HI>fearful Sight,</HI> and a <HI>great Sign from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 There are fearful Sights and Signs appearing in the <HI>Air,</HI> sometimes in the lower heaven, which we move &amp; breathe in. Prodigious Meteors are sometimes seen there. And strange Appearances, which are either seen, or heard speaking. Of these fearful sights and signs, is the Text likewise to be interpreted. <HI>Josephus</HI> relates, that before the <HI>Romane</HI> Army de∣stroyed <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there were seen in the Air, Iron Chariots, and Souldiers in bat∣tel aray; and in the night time, a great Light appeared in the Temple, for half an hour together, with as much brightness as if it had been noon day; and a Voice was heard saying, <HI>Let us be gone from hence.</HI></P>
<P>Qu. <HI>How doth it appear that such Fearful Sights are Presages of Calamityes coming upon the World?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. The Scripture is clear for this. The Text before us doth expresly de∣clare
<PB N="11" REF="000320_0018_0FA4AEEC4A6C7118"/>
no less. And the Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> foretelling the same Calamityes which this Text hath reference unto, saith also, that pro∣digious Signs in heaven should presage and portend them. <HI>Joel,</HI> 2.30, 31. <HI>I will shew Wonders in the heaven.</HI> Truly, Bla∣zing Stars are Wonders in the heaven. <HI>And in the Earth, blood, and fire, and pil∣lars of smoke before the great and the terri∣ble Day of the Lord come.</HI> When <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> was destroyed, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> state dissolved, that was a great and notable Day of the Lord, a Type of the great Day of Judgement. <HI>Wonders,</HI> even pro∣digious and amazing Signs should precede it. A very learned <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg">Mede <HI>Dis∣course.</HI> 6. <HI>P.</HI> 37</NOTE> and judicious Inter∣preter conceiveth that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> of old did use to call Comets, or Blazing Stars by that name of <HI>A Pillar of Smoke</HI>; because sometimes they appear like Pillars of smoke, and that therefore when it is said, there shall be Pillars of smoke before the terrible Day of the Lord, the true mea∣ning and intendment of those Expressions is,
<PB N="12" REF="000320_0019_0FA4AEECFA204790"/>
that Comets should precede and presage the miseryes coming upon the <HI>Jewish</HI> Na∣tion. Yea, the Scripture informs us, that <HI>Fearful Sights and Signs in heaven,</HI> shall precede the Great and General Day of Judgement, as Presages thereof. <HI>Luk.</HI> 21.25. <HI>There shall be Signs in the starres:</HI> meaning that such things should be obser∣ved among the Stars in heaven, as would be a Sign that Christ's coming to Judge the World, did approach. Wherefore in Verse 28. it is said, <HI>When these things come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your Redemption draweth nigh.</HI> The Day of <HI>Judgement,</HI> is a Day of <HI>Re∣demption,</HI> and is so called in other Scrip∣tures, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.30. Then shall the Bo∣dies of the Saints be redeemed from the power of the Grave; and both Bodies and Souls, redeemed from all Evils of sin and of suffering. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. At the Resurrection, in the last Day, will the great Redemption be to the Saints of God, and the greatest Miseryes to the Wicked that ever were thought of. And
<PB N="13" REF="000320_0020_0FA4AEEDEA004220"/>
Signs in heaven shall precede them. And hence it is, that <HI>Fearful Sights</HI> are called <HI>Signs</HI> in the Scripture; it is partly on this account, in that they are <HI>Signs</HI> that the Lord is coming forth out of his holy ha∣bitation, to punish the World for their Iniquityes.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Experience of many Ages doth bear witness to the truth of this Do∣ctrine. If the Scripture were silent about this matter, the Experience both of for∣mer and later Ages doth sufficiently and sadly confirm the Truth in hand. Hence an <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Cum Deus puniturus sit gentem vel urbem, Prodigijs id prius solet significare,</HI> <BIBL>Herod. <HI>l.</HI> 6.</BIBL></Q> <HI>Lege</HI> Melchioris Junij <HI>Orat. Par.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 425.</NOTE> heathen Writer could say, <HI>If God be about to punish a City or a Nation, He is wont first to give warning of it by Prodigyes,</HI> by Signs from heaven. And commonly it is so, that when stupendous Signs go before, stupendous Judgements follow after. Some <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><Q><P><HI>Conradus Lycosthenes</HI> Librum edidit in quo omnia collegit Prodigia, quae ab exor∣dio mundi ostensa sunt.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="000320_0021_0FA4AEEE6CC549D8"/>
the Fearful Sights, which have at several times and places been observed in the World; and the Judgements and Mi∣seryes which have followed.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many times such fearful Sights are tokens of God's Anger; which is another Reason why they are called <HI>Signs,</HI> as be∣ing Signs of the Anger of God. Signs that flaming Vengeance is kindled, and burning in Heaven against a sinful World. Now when God is angry, then Publick Judgements come, as Testimonyes of Di∣vine Displeasure. <HI>Personal</HI> Afflictions are not alwayes Evidences of God's An∣ger, as we see in <HI>Job</HI>: but <HI>Publick</HI> Judge∣ments are ever wont to be so. 'Tis thought that the ninetieth Psalm was pen∣ned by <HI>Moses</HI> on occasion of a publick Judgement, the Plague which broke in upon the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and swept away many Thousands of them: And saith he, <HI>We are consumed by thy Anger, &amp; by thy Wrath are we troubled,</HI> V. 7. So that if Publick Judgements come, God is angry, and his Wrath kindled: He doth
<PB N="15" REF="000320_0022_0FA4AEEF421F6948"/>
by them testify, and power down his righ∣teous Displeasure from Heaven. Inas∣much then as fearful Sights are Tokens of God's Anger, they are Presages of great and publick Calamities. As the <HI>Rainbow</HI> (though a natural Sign) is a token of Di∣vine <HI>Favour</HI>; so are prodigious Sights Tokens of Divine <HI>Anger.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. These fearful Sights are many times Presages of those things which make way for great Changes and Calamityes to come upon the World. They are often∣times (Blazing Stars <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>Damascen. <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 6. Isidor. <HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>Etymol.</HI></P>

<HI>Rev.</HI> 8.10. <HI>There fell a great star from hea∣ven, burning as it were a lamp.</HI> It is con∣ceived, that the ruine of <HI>Augustulus,</HI> de∣throned by <HI>Odoacer</HI> the <HI>Herulian,</HI> was sig∣nified by those words, and that he is re∣sembled to that sort of <HI>Comets,</HI> which is called <HI>Lampadias.</HI> And when there is a Star burning and blazing in heaven, com∣monly it proves fatal to some <HI>Augustulus</HI>; whence great Changes &amp; miseryes ensue. Yea, the Death of <HI>worthy</HI> (as well as <HI>great</HI>) Personages, is sometimes porten∣ded by such Signs. A little before great <HI>Constantine</HI>'s death, a blazing Star appea∣red, and infinite miseryes followed. In the Year <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Alsted. <HI>Chronol. C.</HI> 49 <HI>ubi de Come∣tit.

<P>Quest. 3. <HI>What Calamityes do such fearful Sights and Signs in heaven presage?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We must not be particular and
<PB N="17" REF="000320_0024_0FA4AEF186F3ADA8"/>
positive in Interpretations of things of this nature. When a fearful Sight ap∣pears in heaven, which the whole World cannot but take notice of, now to make a particular and absolute determination <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> Voet. <HI>in Disp. de Signis. P.</HI> 919, 930.</NOTE>, that such a Place, or such a Person, such a Judgement, is certainly intended there∣by, is too much boldness. In general, we may safely say, that there is just cause to expect that great Calamityes are at hand: but what Persons or Places shall more eminently fall under those Judge∣ments, is not for us to determine; but we must leave that with God, who best knows what himself intends to do.</P>
<P>This being premised, we proceed in Answering the Enquiry before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes such Signs are Presages of great Persecutions coming upon the Church of God. The Lord in mercy to his People, giveth them such Warnings, that so they may prepare for what's a coming, or make haste to enter into the Chambers of safety, as it were for a little
<PB N="18" REF="000320_0025_0FA4AEF2286A63C8"/>
moment, till the Indignation be overpast. <HI>Nero</HI>'s bloudy Persecution had a <HI>Blazing Star</HI> to precede it. The same is true con∣cerning the <HI>Arian</HI> Heresy and persecution▪ that flood spoken of in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> which the Dragon cast out of his mouth, and whereby the Woman, the Church, fled into the Wilderness, was in eminent danger of being swallowed up and devou∣red. <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sometimes such Signs in heaven are Presages of miserable Dearths and Scarcity. That Blazing Star impending over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which the Text hath refe∣rence unto, was attended with a terrible. Famine, whereby multitudes perished <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the Years after Christ,</HI> 876. 948. 964. <HI>there were Blazing Stars seen, presaging Famines &amp; other Judgements.</HI> In Annis 674, 675, 676. <HI>Comets appeared, and sore Droughts followed: In some Countryes it rained not for</HI> 3 <HI>Years together. The like Miseryes followed the Comet</HI> Anno 1477. In Annis 594. 1527. 1542. <HI>Comets were seen, and Armies of Locusts followed, devouring the Fruits of the Earth.</HI></NOTE>. And therefore such Signs are frequently portentous of those Judgements, which
<PB N="19" REF="000320_0026_0FA4AEF3A5152618"/>
cause Want and scarcity▪ <HI>e. gr.</HI> of sore Droughts and Blastings, and the multi∣plication of noxious Creatures that de∣stroy the Fruits of the Earth. All which particulars I could confirm unto you by approved History, which declareth how they have all been presaged by <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> in heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. Lamentable Deaths and Destructi∣ons amongst Men, have been oftentimes presaged by such Sights in heaven. Sud∣den and amazing Ruines, by <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the Years</HI> 66, 78. 79, and 668. <HI>Comets appeared, after which terrible Earthquakes hapned in many Places.</HI> Annis 377, 912, 1530. <HI>there were blazing stars appea∣ring; and Inundations followed in diverse places. Quickly after the Comet</HI> Anno 882. <HI>the famous City of</HI> Triers <HI>was burnt to the ground.</HI> Alsted. <HI>ubi supra.

Especially destructions by mortal and contagious Diseases. That strange Disease, known by the name of
<PB N="20" REF="000320_0027_0FA4AEF3C30C6928"/>
<HI>Sudor Anglicanus,</HI> which in a peculiar manner pursued those of the <HI>English</HI> Nati∣on, even when in strange Lands; whence they were dreaded in all places where they came, there was a <HI>Blazing Star</HI> that did precede it. Especially that which is, of all Diseases miserable Mortals are subject unto, the most terrible, I mean the <HI>Plague</HI> of <HI>Pestilence,</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anno</HI> 1457 <HI>Cometa quem</HI> nigrum <HI>app<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hant, appa∣ruit, secuta est Pestis diuturnior.

Anno</HI> 1006. <HI>Cometa, quem Pestis excepit, ut vivi cum mortuis sepelirentur: multa Oppida plane exhausit.</HI></NOTE> it is frequently thus presa∣ged. Such Sights are <HI>Heaven</HI>'s <HI>Alarm</HI> to a sinful World, to give notice that God hath bent his Bow, and made his Arrows ready, and that if Sinners turn not, the Arrows of Pestilence and Death shall fall down upon them speedily. This might be confirmed by a multitude of Instances; but it needs not. Our own Experience is enough. We cannot but rememember the <HI>Blazing Star</HI> that was seen but 16
<PB N="21" REF="000320_0028_0FA4AEF466552FC8"/>
Years agoe, and a terrible <HI>Plague</HI> follow∣ed; so that in our own Nation, near upon an <HI>hundred thousand</HI> were swept away in one City, and in one Year. And it is re∣ported, that immediately after that great <HI>Blazing Starre,</HI> which appeared above threescore years ago, God sent the <HI>Plague</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Gor∣ge<HI>'s Description of</HI> New-Engl. <HI>Pag.</HI> 27.</NOTE> amongst the Natives in this Land, which swept them away in such multitudes, as that the living were not enough to bury the dead. So did the Lord cast out the Heathen before this his People, that the way might thereby be prepared unto our more peaceable settle∣ment here, The Lord in mercy grant, that we may never, by becoming like un∣to the Heathen in Profaneness and Irreli∣gion, provoke Him to do unto us, as He hath done unto them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such fearful Sights and Signs in heaven, are usual Presages of War among the Nations, and so of those Devastations and Desolations which the Sword leaveth behind it. Prodigyes on the <HI>Earth</HI> doe
<PB N="22" REF="000320_0029_0FA4AEF6B6337D00"/>
sometimes betoken War and Bloodshed, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 3.22. And Signs in <HI>Heaven</HI> do no less. Thus in my Text, the <HI>Romane</HI> Sword, which made the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation desolate (according to <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Prophesy Ch. 9.27.) was portended by a fearful <HI>Blazing Star</HI> in heaven. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>— Belli mala signa Cometae.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Tibul.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Stella <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elucebit Gladij mortalibus index.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Sibyl.</HI> Or. l. <HI>3.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>And when <HI>Alaricus</HI> the <HI>Goth</HI> made such a terrible Irruption upon the <HI>Romane</HI> Em∣pire, like a storm of Hail, and Fire, and Blood, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.7. <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> in heaven preceded those Calamityes. When <HI>At∣tila,</HI> who they say, called himself <HI>Flagel∣lum Dei,</HI> God's Whip, to scourge the World for their Wickedness, when he was armed to be the Executioner of divine Vengeance upon the Earth, destroying Cityes, and laying Nations waste before him, <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> were seen preceding and portending those miserable Times. In like manner, when the <HI>Saracens</HI> (the first Wo-Trumpet) and the <HI>Turks</HI> (the
<PB N="23" REF="000320_0030_0FA4AEF9156D4678"/>
second VVo-Trumpet, prophesied of in the <HI>Revelation</HI>) were let loose upon the Apostate Christian VVorld, <HI>Blazing Starres,</HI> and <HI>Fearful Sights in heaven</HI> did precede those woful Dayes. And are there not some alive, and here before the Lord this day, that can remember the <HI>bla∣zing Star</HI> which appeared in the 9<HI>th.</HI> and in the 10<HI>th.</HI> Moneths, in the Year 1618. and the next Year began that unhappy VVar in <HI>Germany,</HI> which proved so fatal to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest there.</P>
<P>Thus have we seen what Judgements and Calamityes, <HI>Fearful Sights in heaven</HI> are commonly the Presages of. As for that <HI>SIGN</HI> in heaven, now appearing, (which hath occasioned me to speak this Word at this time) what Calamityes may be portended thereby, which of the Judgements mentioned, or whether all of them be not thereby presaged, I shall not say; but leave it unto God and Time to discover. Only in general, we have cause to fear, that sweeping Judgements are thereby signified; that the Lord is
<PB N="24" REF="000320_0031_0FA4AEFB965F10E8"/>
coming down from Heaven vvith a long Beesom of Destruction, which shall sweep away a world of Sinners before it.</P>
<P>I conclude with a word of <HI>Application:</HI> Nor would I speak any thing, but the words of Truth and soberness, as beco∣meth a Messenger of Christ to doe, when speaking in His Name.</P>
<P>USE. <HI>Let us hence be Exhorted to ap∣prove our selves as those that are under the solemn, awful Warnings of God, ought to do.</HI> I need not say (for every one knows it) that there is a Fearful Sight and Sign ap∣pearing in the heavens: Such a formida∣ble <HI>Blazing-star,</HI> as that the like hath seldom been observed. It concerns us then, to hearken to the voice of the Lord therein; who by such tremendous Sights is speaking awfully to the children of Men. Hear then <HI>Heaven's Alarm</HI> this day. You will say, But what should we now do? <HI>What doth the Lord expect from us, when there are such dreadful Presages of Evils coming upon the World?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="000320_0032_0FA4AEFBED4998F0"/><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It now concerns us to be <HI>awa∣kened out of all Security.</HI> That's one of God's ends (his declared end) in cau∣sing such <HI>Fearful Sights</HI> to be taken notice of, that so he might awaken a secure slee∣ping World. And indeed the Lord ma∣nifests his Goodness and Compassion to∣wards sinful Creatures therein. It was a pious Speech of that <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><Q><HI>Ejus Clementiam lau∣dare tenemur, qui nostram inertiam, talibus monere dig¦natur indicijs.</HI> <BIBL>Carolus Magnus; <HI>vel ut alij volunt,</HI> Ludovicus I.

the Signs and Presages thereof, He bids them <HI>Watch therefore,</HI> Luk. 21.36. Let us not then please our selves, with imagining that such Fearful Sights are Signs of <HI>Mercy</HI> only, and not of <HI>Judge∣ment.</HI> The contrary unto which Opini∣on, hath been confirmed by more than two hundred Instances <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Consulatur</HI> Heidfeld, Sphynx <HI>Philosoph. p.</HI> 1087.</P>

Men are ex∣ceeding apt to in∣terpret such things in a way of favour to themselves, when nothing less is intended there∣by. So when these <HI>Fearful Sights and Signs in heaven</HI>; which my Text speaketh of, were seen at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> did interpret them as <HI>good Omens</HI> to themselves; and as omi∣nous of Destruction to their Enemies. The Prodigies in <HI>Germany</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Clark<HI>'s Martyrology p.</HI> 311. &amp;c.</NOTE> were looked upon by the <HI>Protestants</HI> as Signs of Deliverance unto them, and of Destruction to their Enemies. But alass!
<PB N="27" REF="000320_0034_0FA4AEFD739323E8"/>
the Event was quite otherwise. And let us not make our selves secure, by saying or thinking, that the Lord by such <HI>fearful Sights</HI> speaks to <HI>others onely,</HI> and not unto <HI>us.</HI> As <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperour, when <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Testante</HI> Suetonio.</NOTE> there was a long <HI>hairy Comet</HI> seen, he did but deride at it, and make a Joke of it, say∣ing, That it concerned the <HI>Parthians</HI> that wore long hair, and not him, who was bald: but within a Year, <HI>Vespasian</HI> him∣self (and not the <HI>Parthian</HI>) dyed. Such fearful Sights are usually Signs, that those Judgements, which are (as <HI>Tertullian</HI> speaks) <HI>Tonsurae humani generis,</HI> God's sharp Razors on Mankind, whereby He doth poll, his Sythe, whereby He doth shear down multitudes of sinful Creatures, doe draw near: In which respect, there is no doubt to be made of it, but that God by this <HI>Blazing-star,</HI> is speaking to other Places, and not to <HI>New-England</HI> onely. And it may be, He is declaring to that ge∣neration of hairy Scalps, who go on still in their Trespasses, that the day of their Cala¦mity
<PB N="28" REF="000320_0035_0FA4AEFE438AAD60"/>
is at hand, and that the things which shal come upon them make haste. A <HI>strange Sight</HI> doth betoken <HI>strange Punishment</HI> coming upon those that have been prodi¦gious workers of Iniquity. Yet let not us promise to our selves nothing but Prospe∣rity in the doleful &amp; the bitter Day, when there shall be Lamentation generally. I am perswaded, that the floods of great water are coming. I am perswaded that God is about to open the windows of heaven, and to pour down the Cataracts of his Wrath, ere this Generation (where∣in <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Profaneness</HI> are come to such a prodigious height) I say, ere this Generation is passed away. But what reason have we to think that no drops of the fatal Storm shall come near to us? If we so conclude, we may provoke the Lord to say, <HI>The Sinners of my People shall dye by the Sword, who say, The Evil shall not overtake us nor prevent us.</HI> To be awakened out of Security, and trembling∣ly to wait for the good Pleasure of God, whatever it may be, is the most likely
<PB N="29" REF="000320_0036_0FA4AEFF074C2230"/>
way to find Rest in the day of Trouble. So did the Prophet find it, <HI>Hab.</HI> 3.16. <HI>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled in my self, that I might rest in the Day of Trouble.</HI> When the thundring voice of Judgement was heard, his heart trembled at it, so did he find Rest in the Day of Trouble.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This should put us upon preparing for another Day of Trouble.</HI> And this should we do the rather, since the Changes por∣tended by this <HI>Comet,</HI> are like to come <HI>speedily</HI> as well as <HI>certainly. Joseph</HI> said to <HI>Pharaoh, For that the Dream is doubled, it is because the thing is established by God, &amp; God will shortly bring it to pass.</HI> Gen. 41.32 Doth not the <HI>doubled Appearance</HI> of this Fearful Sight in the heavens speak as much? Let us then prepare for Trou∣ble. We should not onely expect it; but so expect it, as to prepare for it. Cer∣tainly we have reason so to do. If there had been no <HI>Blazing-star,</HI> yet upon other accounts, we have cause to expect and
<PB N="30" REF="000320_0037_0FA4AEFFB21847A0"/>
prepare for <HI>another Day of Trouble,</HI> which seems to be hastning upon thee O <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> and upon thee, O <HI>BO∣STON</HI>! The <HI>Sins</HI> which are amongst us, are surer and blacker Signs of Judge∣ment, than any <HI>Signs in heaven,</HI> that we may think of. I say the Sins, the <HI>Pride,</HI> the <HI>Profaneness,</HI> the <HI>Worldliness,</HI> the gene∣ral <HI>Security</HI> and <HI>Iniquity</HI> that prevaileth amongst us. Especially considering how little good all former Judgements and Dispensations have done upon us. What <HI>Fiery Desolations</HI> hath the Lord made a∣mongst us? The Lord hath been roaring out of <HI>Sion.</HI> Such roaring Judgements have been amongst us, as that the Report of them hath been heard afar off. <HI>Sword, Death,</HI> and <HI>Fire.</HI> But (alass! O Lord God) may it not be said concerning the generality of men, They return not to Him that hath been smiting of them? They are the same since the <HI>War,</HI> since the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> since the <HI>Fires</HI>▪ that they were before. Ah! what will come next? We have cause to expect, and it vvill be
<PB N="31" REF="000320_0038_0FA4AF0073732480"/>
our vvisdom to prepare for <HI>another Day of Trouble</HI> seven times greater than the for∣mer. It grieveth me to speak thus, but I cannot forbear. I feel that the Word of the Lord is like a fire in a mans bones, and it will break out. The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy? And now know for certain, that if destroying Judgements and Death overtake any in their Sins, and sweep them avvay to Hell, their blood shall be upon their own heads. For the Lord hath fired his Beacon in the heavens, among the Stars of God there; the <HI>Fearful Sight</HI> is not yet out of sight. The <HI>Warning-piece</HI> in heaven is going off, now then if the Lord discharge his <HI>Murdering-pieces</HI> from on high, and men be found in their Sins, unfit for Death, their blood shall be upon them. They had Warning given them that the Sword was a coming: Lo, the Lord himself gave them the warning; but they would not take vvarning, their blood shall be upon them. Moreover, if Troubles should not come, yet it vvill be vvisdom to pre∣pare

for them. If the Lord, after Hee hath sent his Angel to stand with a drawn Sword over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> should be entrea∣ted to spare us, yet it will never do us hurt to prepare for the most deadly Arrows of Affliction that may light upon us, vvhilst in this Vale of Tears.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We should do what in us lyes to divert those Judgements, which seem to be impen∣ding, and blazing over our heads.</HI> This word of Comfort, I may safely speak, <HI>The Lord's Threatenings are not absolute; but conditional.</HI> So far as we in these ends of the Earth, these goings down of the Sun, are spoken unto, by this <HI>Sign in the heavens,</HI> it is possible we may escape the Evils threatened thereby, if we duely hearken to the Voice of God therein. <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.7, 8. <HI>At what time I speak concer∣ning a Nation &amp; concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that Nation against whom I have pro∣nounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to doe unto them.</HI> So that when desolating Judgements are

threatned, either by the Word, or by the awful Works of God, those denuncia∣tions of Wrath are not <HI>absolute,</HI> but <HI>condi∣tional.</HI> If Repentance intervene, the E∣vils which otherwise must be looked for, may be diverted. See therefore <HI>Jer.</HI> 36 3, 7. <HI>It may be the house of</HI> Judah <HI>will hear all the Evil which I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way.</HI> Ay, a general Repentance is that which will do, if every man turn from his evil way, <HI>that I may forgive their Iniquity and their sin. It may be they will present their Supplication before the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. This is that which the Lord would have; therefore He saith, I'le stir up the spirit of my Ministers and Ambassadors, that they shall declare and denounce my Judge∣ments against a sinful Generation. <HI>It may be they will hear.</HI> And I'le speak by awful Signs from heaven, that may be as He∣raulds to proclaim <HI>Wrath and Wo</HI> to the World, <HI>It may be they will hear,</HI> and then shall their sins be forgiven. You will say, <HI>But what shall we do, that so the Judge∣ments

which are blazing over us, may be di∣verted from us? Answ.</HI> Pray, and cry mightily to Heaven. For this let every one that is godly pray unto the Lord in a time wherein He may be found, and be∣fore the Floods of great waters come nigh unto us. Our Lord Jesus Christ, having warned his Disciples of approaching Ca∣lamityes, He concludeth vvith an Exhor∣tation unto Prayer, <HI>Luk,</HI> 21 36. <HI>Pray al∣wayes, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.</HI> Prayer may do much toward the averting of wrathful Judgements and Desolations. When the Lord threatned to bring Famin and Destruction upon his People, <HI>Amos</HI> fell to praying; and God said, <HI>This shall not be,</HI> this Judgement and threatned de∣solation shall not be. <HI>Amos</HI> 7.3, 6. O then, let us deprecate impending Judge∣ments. Do vve see the Sword <HI>blazing</HI> over us? Let it put us upon crying to God, that that Judgement may be diver∣ted, and not return upon us again so spee∣dily. Do vve see the Arrows of Pesti¦lence
<PB N="35" REF="000320_0042_0FA4AF04637817E8"/>
and Death <HI>blazing</HI> over us? Oh! Pray that the destroying Angel may not be sent to vvalk in darkness, and to vvaste at noon day. Doth God threaten our very Heavens? O pray unto Him, that He vvould not take away <HI>Stars</HI> and send <HI>Comets</HI> to succeed them. Pray that the Lord Jesus, vvho holds the Stars in His right Hand, may continue those in the Firmament of his Churches (the Heaven vvhich his own Hand hath planted) who are indeed <HI>Stars,</HI> vvilling to impart the Light vvhich they have received from Christ, unto his People: and that <HI>wan∣dring Stars, blazing Stars, seducing Spirits</HI> may never come in their room. I am not vvithout fear, that this vvill at last be the Judgement of God upon <HI>New England</HI> and upon these Churches. Pray that it may never be. And our <HI>Supplications</HI> should be attended vvith deep <HI>Humiliati∣on,</HI> Zeph. 2.2, 3. <HI>Gather your selves toge∣ther,</HI> h. c. Come before the Lord in a vvay of publick, solemn Humiliation, <HI>be∣fore the decree,</HI> i. e▪ the Judgement written

and threatned, <HI>bring forth, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you: seek the Lord — It may be you shall be bid in the day of the Lord's anger.</HI> Thus then should we do in this day, vvhen there are such dark &amp; angry Clouds hanging over our heads; and vve know not how soon they may break upon us. And truly, if our <HI>Lectures,</HI> were, some of them, turned into dayes of <HI>Prayer,</HI> at such a time as this, it is no more than vvhat there is cause for. And there is one thing more, that should in special be remembred by us; a thing that hath been much tal'kd of; but little hath been done in it, that is, <HI>Reformation! Reformation</HI>! When the Prophet <HI>Jonah</HI> vvas sent of God to preach and say, <HI>Yet forty dayes, and</HI> Nineveh <HI>shall be destroyed:</HI> that was a more awful Sign of Desolation, than if they had seen a <HI>Blazing star</HI> hang∣ing over the City, menacing the Ruine thereof: Yet vvhen they repented, and <HI>reformed</HI> (though it vvas but an external Reformation) the Lord spared them

forty years longer. Ah! <HI>New-England,</HI> wilt thou not do more than <HI>Nineveh</HI>? shall there not be so much as an <HI>external Refor∣mation</HI> of those things that provoke the glorious Eyes of Heaven? Will not the haughty Daughters of Sion, reform their Pride in Apparel? Will they have <HI>the Attire of an Harlot</HI>? Will they lay out their Hair, and wear their false Locks, their Borders, and Towers like <HI>Comets,</HI> about their heads? Will they do so, un∣till God send his Arrows from Heaven, to smite them down into the Grave, where the dayes of Darkness shall be many? And shall there be still such a multitude of <HI>Licensed Drinking-Houses</HI> (and Town-dwellers frequenting them) to the Shame of <HI>Boston,</HI> and to the Infamy of <HI>New-England</HI>; notwithstanding the Testimony which God, and his Servants have given against it? How then shall we think to escape in the Day of the Lord's Anger; if a <HI>Reformation,</HI> so much as in these Exter∣nals, which it is so easy to reform, will not be obtained? O Return, Return unto

the Lord. And in that way let us betake our selves unto the shading Wings of the Lord Jesus! Do we not hear Him speaking to us, as sometimes unto <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>? Mat. 23.37. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusa∣lem, how often would I have gathered thee, as an Hen her Chickens under her wings.</HI> Saith the Lord, The <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles, those birds of prey, are hastening upon you: But if you would have come under My Wings, you should have been safe enough.
