<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a magnificent spectacle to be∣hold a great people annually crouding their temples to consecrate the anniversary of their sovereignty. On this occasion the heart of every true American beats high with a just and noble pride. He still hears the illustrious Fa∣thers of his Country, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of their con∣duct, declare that the United States "are, and of right ought to be, Free and Independent." The black catalogue of injury, abuse, contempt and crime, which exhausted forbearance and drove us to resistance, rushes on his mind. He passes in review those great men who then burst upon the world, and who, endowed with every virtue and every talent which could fit them for the arduous task in which they engaged, appeared to be expressly commission∣ed by Heaven to rule the storm of revolution. It was then indeed that human nature, which for eigh∣teen centuries had appeared nearly to have lost those qualities which alone ennoble it, emerged at once
<PB N="4" REF="038436_0003_1011D0B19BAEA3B0"/>
from its degradation and recovered the lustre with which it shone in the happiest days of antiquity.</P>
<P>On the islands of the Adriatic, the mountains of Biscay, and the rocks of Uri, the spirit of Liberty had indeed successfully sought a refuge, but driven at last, from all that could delight her on earth, she had already flapped her wings on the glaciers of Switzer∣land, and was taking her flight towards Heaven— The American people rose—they burst their fetters —they hurled them at their oppressors—they shout∣ted they were free—The sound broke across the Atlantic—it shook the fog-wrapt island of Britain, and re-echoed along the Alps. The ascending spi∣rit heard it—she recognized in it the voice of her e∣lect, and holding her course westward, she rejoicing saw her incense rise from a thousand altars. Her presence assured our triumph. Painful however was the struggle and terrible the conflict which ob∣tained that triumph—our harbours filled with hos∣tile fleets—our fields ravaged—our cities wrapt in flames—a numerous, veteran and unprincipled en∣emy let loose upon us—our army thinned by battles —wasted by sickness—disgusted by treachery and desertion—a prey to every species of privation and reduced to the last misery next despair—Even then, however, this little army showed themselves worthy the holy cause for which they contended. Driven from Long-Island—from the heights of Harlem—from White Plains—pursued from post to post even to beyond the Delaware—they would often turn upon their insulting foe—and min∣gling their blood with the melting lava of the can∣non's mouth, foretel them of Trenton, German∣town and Monmouth.</P>
<P>BUT it was not in the ardent conflicts of the field only that our countrymen fell; it was not the ordi∣nary chances of war alone, which they had to en∣counter.
<PB N="5" REF="038436_0004_1011F03DEA647678"/>
Happy indeed, thrice happy were War∣ren, Montgomery and Mercer; happy those other gallant spirits who fell with glory in the heat of bat∣tle, distinguished by their country, and covered with her applause. Every soul, sensible to honor, envies rather than compassionates their fate It was in the dungeons of our inhuman invaders; it was in their loathsome and pestiferous prison-ships, that the wretchedness of our countrymen still makes the heart bleed. It was there that hunger and thirst and disease, and all the contumely cold-hearted cru∣elty could bestow sharpened every pang of death. Misery there wrung every fibre that could feel be∣fore she gave the blow of grace which sent the suf∣ferer to eternity. It is said that poison was em∣ployed—No—there was no such mercy there—There nothing was employed which could blunt the sus∣ceptibility to anguish, or which by hastening death could rob its agonies of a single pang. On board one only of these prison-ships above eleven thou∣sand of our brave countrymen are said to have pe∣rished. She was called the Jersey. Her wreck still remains, and at low ebb presents to the world its accursed and blighted fragments. Twice in twenty four hours the winds of heaven sigh through it and repeat the groans of our expiring country∣men▪ and twice the ocean hides in her bosom those deadly and polluted ruins, which all her waters can∣not purify. Every rain that descends washes from the unconsecrated bank the bones of those intrepid sufferers. They lie naked on the shore accusing the neglect of their countrymen. How long shall gratitude and even piety deny them burial. They ought to be collected in one vast ossory▪ which shall stand a monument to future ages of the two extremes of the human character; of that depravity which, trumpling on the rights of misfortune, perpetrated cold and calculating murder on a wretched and de∣fenceless
<PB N="6" REF="038436_0005_1011F0021204E270"/>
prisoner, and that virtue which animated this prisoner to die a willing martyr for his country. Or rather, were it possible, there ought there to be raised a Colossal Column, whose base sinking to hell, should let the murderers read their infamy inscribed on it, and whose capital of Corinthian laurel as∣cending to heaven should show the sainted Patriots that they have triumphed.</P>
<P>DEEP and dreadful as the colouring of this pic∣ture may appear, it is but a faint and imperfect sketch of the original. You must remember a thou∣sand unutterable calamities, a thousand instances of domestic as well as national anxiety and distress, which mock description. You ought to remember them, you ought to hand them down in tradition to your posterity, that they may know the awful price their fathers paid for freedom.</P>
<P>IT would be well however amidst these bitter re∣collections, to suppress if possible the muttered curse of indignation; to pass in silence over the name of that nation which was our enemy; and if the ef∣fort is not above human magnanimity, to hold her, without antipathy, "as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends." Of all the pas∣sions which vex the human breast there is none per∣haps which dupes stupidity or excites malevolence like national antipathy. It hangs with a dark ma∣lignity about the heart, and gives a tone to all its emotions. It violates not only the evangelical pre∣cept which enjoins the forgiveness of injuries, but disregarding the maxims of justice and even of com∣mon sense, it denies to virtue its excellence, it takes from crime its guilt, and disturbs society by a furious denunciation of vengeance without being able to assign its provocation. To a man under the in∣fluence
<PB N="7" REF="038436_0006_1011F03F73483450" MS="y"/>
of this unhappy malady, the manners of the unconscious foreigner, his gestures, his language, his food, and even the fashion of his coat are sources of uneasiness. But this is not all: He, who has once justified himself in his hatred to a part of the human race, has surmounted the first great barrier to crime, benevolence. When Amilcar took Hanni∣bal at only nine years old to the altar, and made him swear eternal enmity to the Romans, he viola∣ted the most sacred duties of the Father and the Man. He ought to have filled the heart of his son with benevolence for the promotion of his felicity and that of his fellow-men. Was there not malig∣nity enough in the human breast without exacting a guarantee for its hatred; or was it to be feared that Hannibal would too easily have forgiven his ene∣mies unless forbid by the awful religion of an oath? National antipathy has been the low and ignoble policy employed by some governments to secure support in the wild wars of their ambition, but it is a policy which deeply affronts the people with whom it is employed, a policy which I trust the just and noble spirit of every American will spurn— What—must we be led to believe that the rest of mankind are fools and villains before we can have a good opinion of our own wisdom and virtue; or must we be worked into an idea that they are all cowards before we dare to place a confidence in our own courage. No; let us have the generosity, the magnanimity, the justice, to give to all nations their due; let us dwell on those qualities which exalt ra∣ther than those which disgrace them, and let us found our glory on our own worth and not on their de∣fects.</P>
<P>THE two great objects which divide the industry of the world are agriculture and commerce. States∣men and moralists have calculated the effects which
<PB N="8" REF="038436_0007_1011F00403AC0488"/>
each of these has on the manners and opinions of mankind. They have been generally inclined to be∣lieve that commerce corrupts and makes mankind venal. Among the adversaries, however, of exten∣sive commercial intercourse, will often be found men too deeply impressed with the charms of a country <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who have received disgust from the anx∣ieties and disappointments of trade. They reflect that Carthage was the most commercial nation of antiquity, and there so little regard was paid to the principles of integrity, that Punic faith became pro∣verbial throughout the world. From among the na∣tions of modern times, they chuse out Hamburg. This city, which in a high and pompous stile calls herself free and imperial, is purely commercial. Con∣fined within her ramparts, she holds no intercourse with nature, and it is scarcely known by some of her inhabitants, whether the vegetables they eat are not manufactured like the cloaths they wear. They have no fashions, no manners, and scarce a language of their own. They never think of their God unless it be to effect an insurance against his dispensations. People of all nations and tongues resort there; and when the Citizens of this mighty republic assemble on their Exchange, which to them is the Camp of Mars, they form a motley group, of different form and complexion, of different manners and religion, of different accents and dress from all the differ∣ent quarters of the world, united and alike alone in their object, that of making money. There many a battle is fought, kings dethroned and na∣tions conquered for half per cent. Money is their great good▪ every thing is bought and sold, hospi∣tality herself is set upon the tariff, and they will al∣most give you the price current of an oath. Talk to a Hamburgher, who probably was first a Dutch∣man, a Ragusan, a Genoese, or an Englishman▪
<PB N="9" REF="038436_0008_1011F041045BAD48"/>
about the love of country and he will think you mad —he has no country. Talk to him about liberty and he will praise it, because he thinks you mean a free trade. He troubles himself no further with the political changes in the world than they affect the markets, and if he has a preference for one country above another it is that where the best speculation is to be made.—Such is the sombre pencil with which commerce is pourtrayed. Agriculture is touched with brighter colours. It is remembered that in the early days of Rome every thing virtu∣ous and honorable was found among the rural tribes —The cultivation of the soil gives health and vi∣gor to the body, and purity and tranquillity to the mind. The human form attains in the labors of the field its utmost developement. The full chest, the muscular and brawny arm and the toil-strung sinew are the reward of the husbandman. He preserves with nature all his relations. He every where con∣verses with his God. He every where contem∣plates order, economy and peace, and his soul is filled with a delightful harmony. The seasons re∣turn with unerring regularity; nothing is in vain▪ every thing progresses towards some end for which it has been designed by the eternal wisdom, and every thing attains this end, without interference and without confusion, amidst the low but transporting music of the spheres. The cultivator of the soil is indeed a Patriot. The habits formed in his youth never desert his age. The very trees and rocks a∣mong which he has grown up are objects of his af∣fection. He loves the soil which has rewarded his labours, and he finds music in the echo of his native hills. Even the fidelity of the honest Swiss was not proof to that touching air <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Rans des Vaches.</HI></NOTE> which brought to his remembrance the charms of his rural home. Strong∣ly however as agriculture and commerce may appear
<PB N="10" REF="038436_0009_1011F00FE9D8CC90"/>
to be here contrasted: they are not naturally enemies, nor even rivals; they are friends and ought to unite for the attainment of a great and common object. In this country above all others do they require the mu∣tual aid of each other. Agriculture supplies Com∣merce with the articles of her exports and with a ready market for her returns. Commerce in her turn incites the husbandman to labor beyond his wants by administering to his enjoyments.— Make Commerce the only honorable pursuit; the farmer would desert his plough, and leave the most delightful country in the world to become again a howling wilderness—Destroy commerce, the farmer would transform himself into a winder of silk or a knitter of lace, or, what alas is more pro∣bable, he would be actuated by no nobler incen∣tive than his coarse appetites, he would feel the last ray of civilization expire within him, and he would revert to all the horrors of savage life. Is it not then astonishing that any man should wish for the destruction either of agriculture or commerce, since the first is necessary to life, and the second to make life amiable. It is the spirit of party alone which can be guilty of such madness. But of what is not the spirit of party guilty? It assails the fairest virtue — it overturns the statues of heroes—it ransacks na∣ture for a poison, and by the midnight taper consults with science how to apply it. A thorough party∣man forgets even himself, he is deaf to the sugges∣tions of self-love—he is absorbed in the sole desire of oppressing his opponents, and if ever a ray of plea∣sure crosses his dark and sullen soul it is when he has succeeded in inflicting some misery upon them. In his blind excess he neither loves himself, his par∣ty, or his country; but he hates religiously every one who differs from his opinions, when, perhaps these opinions were as lightly embraced as they are malignantly defended. He often in fact has no more faith in these opinions than the man he would
<PB N="11" REF="038436_0010_1011F007C030C460"/>
sacrifice for not adopting them. He can decree to Aristides the ostracism and to Socrates the deadly hemlock, and the next day advocate the just politics of the one and the pure morality of the other. This party-man has indeed no principle to rest upon, he is hung up like a pendulum and in eternal oscilation as stupidity or design may set him in motion, the rapidi∣ty of his vibrations are inversely as his length. Beware how you indulge this terrible spirit of party. There is no security in the triumph it may obtain for you to day: to morrow the very instruments of that tri∣umph may be turned upon you with affrightful ex∣ecution. The same irregularity, which at one mo∣ment brought the loyal and virtuous Stafford to the scaffold, was found a fit instrument the next for the execution of the popular and illustrious Sydney: the same guillotine severed the neck of Danton which had fallen on that of Louis, and Marius returned from the ruins of Carthage to glut himself with vengeance on those who had driven him thither.</P>
<P>Revolting however as this barbarous spirit may appear, it generally chuses its dwelling in the fairest portions of the world, and altho in its excess it ap∣pears the implacable and mortal enemy to liberty, yet is it nearly allied to that genius of faction which has often proved her strong but untractable friend. This last indeed, appears to be the thunder, which, while it shakes, refreshes and purifies the political atmosphere. Wherever it has been completely silenced every foul and noxious vapor has arisen which could extinguish life or sully its charms. You may have the silence of death, you may have the patient despair of slavery; but violence will ne∣ver obtain for you a free and animated tranquillity. Ireland will indeed be quiet when every tree is turned into a gallows, and France had the ener∣gy of Robertspierre continued a little longer
<PB N="12" REF="038436_0011_1011F01420842C48"/>
would have lost the last virtue that could rebel. All history is indeed full of the factions of free States. These, however, like the mountain oak appeared to ga∣ther vigor from the storms that shook them. Athens in one year, under the deathlike tranquillity of a tyrant, lost more strength, more riches, more elegance, more glory than amidst the boisterous agitations of all her parties or even the conflicts of civil war. But these were not the beggarly and servile conflicts between a red rose and a white one, not whether a weak and inglorious bigot or a wanton and abandoned debau∣chee should be king; they were not those temporary bursts of misery which now and then agitate the wretched inhabitants of Constantinople, and which an execution will allay without exhibiting any evidence of its justice. They sprung from that unbroken spi∣rit, that wild and unfettered boldness, that rest∣less, that uncontroulable, that sublime love of Liberty which sometimes indeed mistakes its means but never loses sight of its object; which while it seems to endanger often secures that object, and which burns with undiminished force while one ge∣nerous sentiment lingers in the human breast to sup∣port it. I would rather, exclaimed a noble Palatin<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Palatin of Posania; his words are Malo Libertatem <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quam quietum servitium.</HI></NOTE> in the Polish diet, I would rather have danger with liberty than safety with servitude. It is indeed bet∣ter to be tossed by the rudest storm that ever vexed the political ocean than to be motionless in port, and like a Genoese galley slave have Liberty only on your chains. But is the human race then doomed to the melancholy alternative of servitude or eternal insurrection. Must they be forever buffeted from despotism to anarchy, and from anarchy to despotism? If from these evils there is a refuge, it is not in the energy of government only, nor in the tame and
<PB N="13" REF="038436_0012_1011F009529F9400" MS="y"/>
worn-down spirit of the people—It is in the diffu∣sion of knowledge, the indulgence of political opin∣ion and the cultivation of the social virtues. You may give to government sufficient power to quell an insurrection, you ought to give it; but there are but two causes of insurrection; oppression and de∣lusion. Will the energy of government redress the first? It is but a sanction to it. Will it cure the last? There is no avenue by which violence can arrive at the understanding. It may well be doubted if a∣mong the fifty thousand Moors, the fierce Zealot <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ferdinand of Arragon.</HI></NOTE> who conquered Grenada caused to be baptized at the point of the bayonet, there was a single convert to the Catholic faith. It is the light of know∣ledge alone which can dissipate error; it is that alone which can give a people worth and respecta∣bility in the eyes of their rulers, and at the same time teach them the necessity of supporting a righ∣teous government. Ignorance, by eternally brood∣ing over imaginary griefs, often produces real ones. That acquaintance, which every one has the leisure to acquire, with the springs of human action and the leading events which have taken place in the world, must show the most timid how terrible that security is which absolute power affords, and con∣vince the most adventurous and hardy of the tre∣mendous attributes of that freedom which exists in tempests and convulsions. Charondas, of all the legislators of antiquity, has alone the glory of having known the true source of republican happiness. He established FREE-SCHOOLS.</P>
<P>MUTUAL moderation between those of different political sentiments is essential to social harmony. It was said with truth, some thousand years ago, that it is not the opinions of men, but their quarrels about these opinions, which disturb the world. We
<PB N="14" REF="038436_0013_1011F00D42315EF0"/>
have seen among religious sects, the astonishing ef∣fects of toleration. From the conquest of Britain by the Romans, to the settlement of this state by its illustrious Founder, that balm to religious dissention appeared, like the lazerpitium of Egypt, to have left the world, or to have been considered as a worthless weed. It was then that the fiercest passions of the human breast, clad themselves in celestial armour, and retiring into the impenetrable recesses of con∣science, harrassed the world with inexorable and cru∣el warfare. It was then that mankind, in contend∣ing for the altar, forgot the God, and destroyed in the name of religion, every thing that was dear to humanity. But when toleration returned, all sects and persuasions, happy in the security obtained for themselves, ceased to molest others; and piety con∣fiding vengeance to him, who has said it is mine, once more kneeled to the divinity.</P>
<P>IF such is the power of toleration over bigotry and superstition, which are uncontroulable by any earthly wisdom, whose flights are above the subli∣mest reason, and leave the understanding wearied and confounded whenever it attempts to pursue them; what have we not a right to expect from political moderation? Politics have no forbidding myste∣ries; they do not strain themselves to be co-exten∣sive with faith, which, expanded by the ardours of zeal, often stretches beyond the utmost confines of possibility; they never leave the earth unless when hoisted for a moment from their sphere, by the gas of visionaries. Here every thing may safely be brought to the test of reason, and here truth, when pursued with sincerity and moderation, will not be pursued in vain. Every absurdity and extravagance necessarily contain the seeds of their own mortality, and unless they receive a forced and artificial exist∣ence
<PB N="15" REF="038436_0014_1011F00BAC3C3418"/>
from persecution, they will die a speedy and tranquil death. It is a powerful truth, that no doctrine hostile to social order, can long prevail a∣mong a calm and enlightened people. Govern∣ment has the safe keeping of the public repose, but it has no right to interfere with the consciences or reasonings of the governed. An interference of this kind is indeed as fruitless as it is unjust. How weak was I, exclaimed, the Imperial <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charles</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI></NOTE> bigot in his convent in Estre Madura, to have endeavored by violence to reduce Europe to one faith, when I am unable to make even two watches move alike.</P>
<P>The next political heresy after intolerance, which merits the reprobation of every good citizen, is de∣ception. Every Government which derives its sup∣port immediately from the people, ought to walk in the light. It ought to be able to meet every investi∣gation, with a serene front; and with that confidence which conscious integrity inspires. A people the least enlightened cannot long be deceived, their good sense will ultimately detect every intrigue, and they will be terrible to those who may have abused their credulity. Darkly barbarous indeed must be that nation which it is necessary to cheat into happiness, and unrighteous and unprincipled must be that go∣vernment which will descend to fraud for any pur∣pose. The false notions of the people are sometimes however called honest prejudices, and the deceptions of government are hallowed with the name of pious frauds. But every man of feeling must weep over that honesty which is the mere result of delu∣sion, and every man of virtue must execrate that piety which couples itself with a fraud.— <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Adams' Defence of the American Constitutions.</HI></NOTE>In America, "however, where the right of sovereign∣ty resides indisputably in the body of the people, and where all are equal by law and by birth," if you ex∣pect purity in the stream, you must keep the source
<PB N="16" REF="038436_0015_1011F0169DD131A8"/>
free from pollution. If there is not virtue in the people, it cannot reasonably be presumed to exist in those who are chosen by and from the people. There is no magic in an election, which will make a sage of an idiot, or transform a rogue into an honest man. Neither is candor and confidence to be ex∣pected in return for violence and jealousy. Every passion constantly tends to reproduce itself in its ob∣ject: Even the divine command to return good for evil, having had to encounter the strongest propensities of the human heart, has obtained but a partial obedience. If you desire then mo∣deration and confidence from your rulers, you must treat them with moderation and confidence. Do you ask what duty imposes on you the obligation of leading the way. It may be answered, that if ever the delightful competition of being and doing good takes place, it must begin somewhere, and you must have a better opinion of the virtue of others than you have of your own if you expect they will be∣gin it.</P>
<P>THE politician may amuse you with a favourite system, he may tell you of the excellence of this or that form of government, he may paint to you the magic there is in a balance of three powers; but every nation will be free or enslaved, happy or mis∣erable, not by the parchments or prescriptions of the magistrate, but by the manners and character of the people. Should the Grand Signior, by his Fir∣man, establish throughout his dominions a Constitu∣tion exactly similar to that of the United States, would Syria, Palestine and Egypt rise from their ru∣ins, or degenerated Greece rekindle the holy fires of her freedom. No—Slavery would there still hug her chains; the Arab would still watch for plunder behind the fallen towers of Palmyra, and the barba∣rous
<PB N="17" REF="038436_0016_1011F042CC19EA68"/>
inhabitant of Romelia would step heedlessly over the fragments of the Areopagus and the pros∣trate columns of the Parthenion. The balance of three powers has been exalted above the influence of religion. But where shall we find its excellence. Shall we look to the governments of ancient times? They have perished? Shall we search for it in England? Did it exist there in the absolute despotism of the Tudors? Did it flourish in the murder and exile of the Stuarts? Is it to be found in the venality of the house of Hanover? Prerogative, indeed, has dropt the sceptre, but corruption pours invisibly her aerial acid on the heart, and stifles there every noble pas∣sion. Patriotism herself has become a mercenary, and the <HI>honest</HI> Englishman of the present day, like Isaac, the Tyrant of Cyprus, is well contented with his chains if they are but of silver. It is a kind of quack∣ery in politics to prescribe one and the same consti∣tution, as a sovereign remedy to the evils of all na∣tions. The excellence of a government does not consist in either concentrating or dividing its powers, nor in an hereditary or elective executive, but in being adapted to the peculiar manners and circum∣stances of the nation, where it is instituted. Super∣latively happy, however, is that nation, where the people are sufficiently temperate and enlightened, to submit to a government of their own choice; for although monarchy may be best for some countries, yet those countries are for that very reason more miserable than where a republic is best. Every man in the United States, who wishes for monarchy, must have either the vanity to think himself more virtuous than his fellow-citizens, or the consciousness that he is not sufficiently virtuous to discharge his duties voluntarily. That man is no less a revolutionist, who would rear a throne on the ruins of a republic than he who would establish popular dominion on the destruction of royal power.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038436_0017_1011F01836EAF1D8" MS="y"/>IT was a maxim of the great De Witt, that no na∣tion however weak ought ever to relinquish a single point, the justice of which is obvious. That na∣tion indeed, which dares not to be just to herself, will never be just to others. Such a nation has no business with sovereignty. It is extravagant and ridiculous for a people to boast of independence, when they are afraid to make peace with one power lest they should provoke another. It must be humilia∣ting to every man of spirit and distressing to every man of principle, tamely to submit to the abuses of a haughty nation, and even to court her favor by wan∣tonly defying her rival. Base and pusillanimous is it to play the hero where there is no danger, and the coward where there is. This is a mode of conduct which may answer the narrow and selfish views of a few little, headstrong political-bargain-makers, but it can never gratify the just pride of a great people.</P>
<P>Perhaps the expectations of many would be here disappointed was the war which now rages in Eu∣rope to be passed over in silence. In that war we behold something to admire but much to condemn. It makes the warriors' pulse beat quick and high. Military skill has there attained its perfection—Han∣nibal and Fabius—Ture<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne and Condè,—Marlbo∣rough and Villars, with all their diversity of excel∣lencies every where find equals. Yet the skill of the General does not surpass the courage of the Soldier. Across the rage of battles, in the deadly breach, over the smoking ashes of cities, and the convulsive mem∣bers of the slain, he seeks for glory. In the onset prompt—impetuous—terrible as the glowing thun∣der bolt—in defence, firm, and calm, and immove∣able as a rock of adamant—A magnanimity—a for∣titude—an intrepidity every where prevail—Victory has lost her insolence—defeat her disgrace and death his terrors. But we must turn from the splendor of
<PB N="19" REF="038436_0018_1011F0454C0CEE30"/>
this seene, where virtue appears at once to weep and to rejoice, where destruction herself rises on her pedestal with a high and imposing majesty, and where human nature indemnifies herself for the calamities she suffers by ennobling the hand which inflicts them —we must turn from this scene to the cold crimes of politics.</P>
<P>ON either side we behold the atrocity of the end aggravated by the atrocity of the means, and the charms of profession harshly contrasted with af∣frightful realities. Universal domination has en∣tered the lists against universal monopoly—while li∣berty and the rights of man have found themselves a∣mong the auxiliaries of tyranny, and religion and the love of order have been pressed into the service of sacrilege and confusion—Liberty—has she de∣molished the Bastile merely to take her sullen seat a∣mong the ruins, and to hurl them at affrighted hu∣manity; and the rights of man do they consist in the expedition of a trial or the dispatch of an exe∣cution—do they hang upon the lamp-post or stream beneath the guillotine—are they to be found in pro∣vincial Holland—in distressed Liguria—in divided Venice, or on the desolated mountains of Helvetia.</P>
<P>ON the other side, does religion leave her holy places to trample upon every thing venerable in years, amiable innocence, or respectable in virtue. Does she execute military law on the catholics of Ireland; does she hang the Jews at Milan; does she mangle, and tear, and devour, the wretched protest∣ants at Naples. Does the love of order fill the world with ruin, discord and murder? Does it open the sluices upon the peasants of Belgium? Does it fire the kelp-thatched hovels of the fishermen on the coasts of Normandy? Does it excite treachery, sedi∣tion and mutiny on board the fleets of Holland? Does

it wake the furies of civil war on the confines of Almo∣rica, and pay the Vendean and Chouan Brigand for the extinction of the human race. Does religion, does the love of order bring single and double knout∣ed devotion from the wilds of Muscovy to fix her polluted altars on the plains of Italy. Do they— but here the full heart must have vent—do they dou∣ble the most southern promontory of Africa to go and overthrow the throne of an independent monarch of Asia. The blood of Saib was as pure as that of the Bourbons—as noble as that of the Bruns∣wicks. Unhappy monarch, was it not enough for him to behold his territories dismembered and de∣vastated—his subjects slaughtered and enslaved—but were his throne, his family and his life devoted to destruction. He defended his power with a spirit which shewed he deserved it. His death was wor∣thy of a king. He fell gored in front by many a wound, and the mangled bodies of his faithful sub∣jects raised over him a glorious mausoleum. Let the pretended champions of religion, of order, and of ancient institutions tell of the plunder each assassin shared from the profaned regalia of this murdered monarch; let the first and most celebrated minister in Europe insult his fallen fortunes, in cold and con∣temptuous irony, with the title of Citizen Tippoo; yet the wrongs of Citizen Tippoo shall be remembered, when the subverters of his power, the destroyers of his life, and the calumniators of his fame shall be crushed with execration or forgotten in oblivion.

<P><PB N="21" REF="038436_0020_1011F047CF1AB300" MS="y"/>SHOULD we be involved in the present European contest, if we are just we shall have nothing to re∣pent—if we are united we shall have nothing to fear. Union is the heart thro' which must cir∣culate those streams of life, of health, of joy, which shall animate every member, which shall heal every disease, and which shall give a zest to every blessing. United you may set securely like a mighty giant on your mountains, and bending a stern regard upon the ocean dare the coming of the proudest foe; the lit∣tle topical eruptions of a County or a State shall yield to the hale vigor of the whole; and every part re∣ciprocating those good offices, which a diversity of soil and climate give them the high privilege of rendering acceptable—you shall exhibit a spectacle which shall awe and delight the universe. Policy, genius, nature herself invites to union. She has bound us together by a chain of mountains which no hu∣man strength can break—she has interlaced us by a hundred majestic streams, which pass and repass the boundaries of States; which parting nearly from the same sources flow in a hundred different direc∣tions, disregarding the little prejudices of the dist∣ricts they fertilize; and now approaching, now rece∣ding from each other, they wind in a thousand mazes and weave a knot which no intrigue can loosen, which no sword can sever. Who will not rise superior to local prepossessions—who will not feel himself the citizen of a common country, the child of a common parent; and who is he, wherever may be his abode, whether on this or the other side of the Chesa∣peak, whether on the banks of the Missisippi, or the borders of the Atlantic, who while he exults in the name of American will not regard as his brother every one who has a title to that proud distinction.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="038436_0021_1011F01E9A623620"/>BE UNITED, was the last injunction which trembled from the lips of our departed WASH∣INGTON. At the name of <HI>Washington</HI> does not a melancholy pleasure sadden and delight your souls. The fourth of July shall never pass but he on it shall be remembered. He has filled the world with his and our glory. The Tartar and the Arab converse about him in their tents. His form al∣ready stands in bronze and marble among the wor∣thies of ancient and modern times. The fidelity of history has already taken care of the immortality of his fame. His example shall animate posterity, and should faction tear or invasion approach our coun∣try, his spirit shall descend from the divinity and in∣spire tranquility and courage. Death has not ter∣minated his usefulness, he has not yet ceased to do good, and even now he holds from his tomb a torch which cheers and enlightens the world. He loved truth, let us love it; let us seek it with a sincere and single heart. It will reward the search. It is great, immutable and eternal. The fugitive fals∣hoods of the moment shall perish; party and pas∣sion may write their names upon the plaster, but this shall one day moulder, and truth remain forever inscribed upon the marble. But mistake not for truth that consistency which constitutes the mock virtue of the present day. In the pursuit of this preposte∣rous virtue the commission of one fault often makes a thousand others necessary. The unfortunate man who has committed it must not allow that he has erred, he must not take council of conscience, he must not claim sanctuary in the charity of his kindred men; but he must have the spirit to adopt a system which shall vindicate the infallibility of his head, tho' at the sacrifice of every amiable quality of his heart; and impelled by the power of consistency he must press onward, tho', like the Leming, he mark his

course thro' life by a right-line of destruction. But truth, tho' it never changes, never errs—it shines with a mild and equal lustre—it breaks thro' the clouds of ignorance and barbarity—it dispels the emanations of vice and folly, and like the sun diffu∣sing light and joy, it goes on forever rejoicing in its course.</P>
