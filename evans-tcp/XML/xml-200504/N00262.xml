<P>This may be done three wayes,</P>
<P N="1">1. By daily renewal of your Faith, in Christ especially of that act of Faith, whereby the Soul knits or ties it self unto Christ, casts or roules it self on Christ for Salvation. Cause your heart in a solemn manner every day to act this part, or put forth this primitive act of Faith in the view of the whole Soul. The daily exercise hereof will increase and strengthen the Divine habit of Faith in the Soul, and make the soul sensible of the very act of it. By frequent believing you shall feel at your very heart, that you do believe so shall you have a witness in your self that you are in Christ, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10.</P>
