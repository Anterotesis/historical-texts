They at whose desire, and upon whose Account chiefly, this Sermon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> printed, are already acquainted with the Circumstances of the Matter; and if any others should happen to see it, and should think it worth their while to read i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I shall only desire of them, that they would put as favourable a Construction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon my herein appearing in Print, as they can; and that they would read the fol∣lowing Discourse with Cando<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and without Prejudice against it, either from an Idea of the Author's Forward∣ness and Ostentation, or the Unfashionableness of the Sub∣ject. As to you, that are the People of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock, of which CHRIST hath called me to the Oversight, I have no Reason to be jealous that you will have any

Prejudice against this Discourse, upon either of these mention'd Accounts, to stand in the way of your duly weighing, and considering, and suitably entertaining the things treated of in it. I have Reason to bless GOD, that there is a more happy Union between us, than that you should be prejudiced against any thing of mine, because 'tis mine; And however the subject is out of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de in the World, 'tis doubtless your peculiar Happiness, that you have been so thoroughly instructed in such like Doctrines, even from your Beginning: and I rejoice in it, that Providence, in this Day of Cor∣ruption and Confusion, has cast my Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where such Doctrines, that I look upon so much the Life and Glory of the Gospel, are not only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n'd, but where there are so many, in whom the Truth of them is so apparently manifest, in their Experience, that any one who has had the Opportunity of Acquaintance with them in such matters, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have had, must be very unreason∣able to doubt of it. It is pleasant to me to read dis∣courses on such Subjects, and to see such Doctrines well treated of in Books, but much more pleasant, to see them clearly exemplified. If what is here offered to you▪ shall be a means further to establish you in such Truths, and to make those among you, that yet remain in spiritual Darkness and Blindness, sensible of their Misery, and stir them up earnestly to seek after this spiritual and divine Illumination; and shall be for the Comfort and Edification of those that have Experienced it, I shall have great Reason to rejoice, and be thank∣ful: and I desire your earnest and continual Prayers for me, that I may be the Instrument of much such Good to you, and Glory to GOD therein.</P>

<HEAD>THE Reality of Spiritual Light.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTHEW XVI.17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And JESUS answered and said unto him, blessed art thou <HI>Simon Barjona;</HI> for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>HRIST says these Words to <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> upon Occasion of his pro∣fessing his Faith in him as the Son of GOD. Our Lord was enquiring of his Disciples, who Men said he was; not that he needed to be informed, but only to introduce and give Occasion to what fol∣lows. They answer, that some said he was <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> and some <HI>Elias,</HI> and others <HI>Jeremias</HI> or one of the Prophets. When they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus given an Account, who others said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was, CHRIST asks them, who they said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was. <HI>Simon Peter,</HI> whom we find always
<PB N="2" REF="003768_0005_1002590B1BF89178"/>
zealous and forward, was the first to answer; be readily replied to the Question, <HI>Thou art CHRIST the Son of the living GOD.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Occasion CHRIST says as he does <HI>to</HI> him and <HI>of</HI> him in the Text: In which we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT <HI>Peter</HI> is pronounced blessed on this Account. <HI>Blessed art thou</HI> —
<Q>Thou art an hap∣py man, that thou art not ignorant of this, that I am <HI>CHRIST the Son of the living GOD.</HI> Thou art distinguishingly happy. Others are blinded, and have dark and deluded Appre∣hensions, as you have now given an Account, some thinking that I am <HI>Elias,</HI> and some that I am <HI>Jeremias,</HI> and some one thing, and some another; but none of them thinking right, all of them misled. Happy art thou, that art so distinguished as to know the Truth in this Matter.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. THE Evidence of this his Happiness decla∣red; <HI>viz.</HI> That GOD and he <HI>only</HI> had <HI>revealed it</HI> to him. This is an Evidence of his being <HI>blessed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> AS it shows how peculiarly favoured he was of GOD, above others. <HI>q. d.</HI>
<Q>How highly favoured art thou, that others that are wise and great Men, the Scribes, Pha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isees, and Rulers, and the Nation in gene∣ral, are left in Darkness, to follow their own misguided Apprehensions, and that thou should'st be singled out, as it were by Name, that my heavenly Father should thus set his Love on <HI>thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bar-jona.</HI> This argues thee <HI>blessed,</HI> that thou should'st thus be the Object of GOD's distinguishing Love.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003768_0006_1002590D4C7898B0"/><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT evidences his Blessedness also, as it intimates that this Knowlege is above any that <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> can <HI>reveal.</HI>
<Q>This is such Knowlege as my <HI>Father which in Hea∣ven</HI> only can give: It is too high and ex∣cellent to be communicated by such Means as other Knowlege is. Thou art <HI>blessed,</HI> that thou knowest that which GOD alone can teach thee.</Q></P>
<P>THE Original of this Knowlege is here de∣clared; both negatively and positively. <HI>Posi∣tively,</HI> as GOD is here declared the Author of it. <HI>Negatively,</HI> as 'tis declared that <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> had <HI>not revealed it.</HI> GOD is the Author of all Knowlege and Understanding whatso∣ever: He is the Author of the Knowledge, that is obtained by human Learning: He is the Author of all moral Prudence, and of the Knowlege and Skill that Men have in their secular Business. Thus it is said of all in <HI>Is∣rael</HI> that were <HI>wise-hearted,</HI> and skill'd in Em∣broidering, that GOD had <HI>fill'd</HI> them <HI>with the spirit of Wisd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> Exod. 28.3.</P>
<P>GOD is the Author of such Knowlege; but yet not so but that <HI>Flesh and Blood reveals</HI> it. Mortal Men are capable of imparting the Knowlege of human Arts and Sciences, and Skill in temporal Affairs. GOD is the Author of such Knowlege by those Means: <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> is made use of by GOD as the <HI>mediate</HI> or <HI>second</HI> Cause of it; He conveys it by the Power and Influence of natural Means. But this spiritual Knowlege, spoken of in the Text, is what GOD is the Author of, and none else: He <HI>reveals it</HI> and <HI>Flesh and Blood re∣veals
<PB N="4" REF="003768_0007_10025910B5B494B8"/>
it not.</HI> He imparts this Knowlege im∣mediately, not making use of any interme∣diate natural Causes, as he does in other Know∣lege.</P>
<P>WHAT had passed in the preceeding Dis∣course, naturally occasioned CHRIST to ob∣serve this▪ because the Disciples had been telling, how others did not know him, but were generally mistaken about him, and di∣vided and confounded in their Opinions of him: but <HI>Peter</HI> had declared his assured Faith that he was the <HI>Son of GOD.</HI> Now it was natural to observe, how it was not <HI>Flesh and Blood,</HI> that had <HI>revealed it to</HI> him, but GOD; for if this knowlege were dependent on na∣tural Causes or Means, how came it to pass that they, a Company of poor Fishermen, illi∣terate Men, and Persons of low Education, attain'd to the knowlege of the Truth; while the Scribes and Pharisees, Men of vastly high∣er advantages, and greater knowlege and sagacity in other matters, remain'd in Igno∣rance? This could be owing only to the gracious distinguishing Influence and Revela∣tion of the SPIRIT of GOD. Hence, what I would make the Subject of my present Dis∣course from these Words, is this</P>
<Q><P>DOCTRINE, viz. That there is such a thing, as A SPIRITUAL and DIVINE LIGHT, immediately impart∣ed to the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul by GOD, of a different Na∣ture from any that is obtain'd by natural Means.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003768_0008_1002591265E3E3E0"/>IN what I say on this Subject at this Time, would</P>
<P N="1">I. SHOW what this <HI>divine Light</HI> is.</P>
<P N="2">II. HOW it is given <HI>Immediately by GOD,</HI> and not <HI>obtain'd by natural Means.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. SHOW the Truth of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>AND then conclude with a brief Improve∣ment.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would show <HI>what this</HI> spiritual and di∣vine Light <HI>is.</HI> And in order to it would shew,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IN a few things <HI>what it is not.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THOSE Convictions that natural Men may have of their Sin and Misery</HI> is not <HI>this</HI> spi∣ritual and divine Light. Men in a natural Condition may have Convictions of the Guilt that lies upon them, and of the anger of GOD, and their Danger of divine Vengeance. Such Convictions are from <HI>Light</HI> or Sensible∣ness of Truth: that some Sinners have a great∣er Conviction of their Guilt and Misery than others, is because some have more <HI>Light,</HI> or more of an Apprehension of Truth, than o∣thers. And this <HI>Light</HI> and Conviction may be from the Spirit of GOD; <HI>the SPIRIT convinces</HI> Men <HI>of Sin</HI>: but yet nature is much more con∣cern'd in it than in the Communication of that <HI>spiritual and divine Light,</HI> that is spoken of in the <HI>Doctrine</HI>; 'tis from the Spirit of GOD only as assisting <HI>natural Principles,</HI> and not as
<PB N="6" REF="003768_0009_1002591619B58EE8"/>
infusing any new <HI>Principles. Common Grace</HI> differs from <HI>special,</HI> in that it influences only by assisting of <HI>Nature</HI>; and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by imparting <HI>Grace,</HI> or bestowing any thing <HI>above</HI> Na∣ture. The <HI>Light</HI> that is obtain'd, is wholly <HI>na∣tural,</HI> or of no superiour <HI>Kind</HI> to what meer <HI>Nature</HI> attains to; tho' more of <HI>that kind</HI> be obtained, than would be obtained if Men were left wholly to themselves. Or <HI>in other Words, Common Grace</HI> only assists the Faculties of the Soul to do that more fully, which they do by <HI>Nature</HI>; as <HI>natural</HI> Conscience, or Reason, will by meer <HI>Nature</HI> make a Man sensible of Guilt, and will accuse and condemn him when he has done amiss. Conscience is a <HI>Principle na∣tural</HI> to Men; and the Work that it doth <HI>naturally,</HI> or of it self, is to give an Appre∣hension of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI>; and to suggest to the Mind the Relation that there is between right and wrong, and a Retribution. The Spirit of GOD, in those Convictions which unregenerate Men sometimes have, assists Con∣science to do this Work in a further Degree, than it would do if they were left to them∣selves: He helps it against those Things that tend to stupify it, and obstruct its Exercise. But in the <HI>renewing</HI> and <HI>sanctifying</HI> work of the HOLY GHOST, those things are wrought in the Soul that are <HI>above</HI> Nature; and of which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is nothing of the like kind in the Soul <HI>by</HI> Nature▪ and they are caused to exist in the Soul h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ually, &amp; according to such a stated Constitution or Law, that lays such a Foundation for E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cises in a continued Course, as is called a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of nature. Not only are remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <HI>Princi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to do their work more freely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but those <HI>Principles</HI> are restored that were utterly destroyed by the
<PB N="7" REF="003768_0010_100259179DC55A68"/>
Fall; and the mind thence-forward habitually exerts those acts that the Dominion of Sin had made it as wholly destitute of, as a dead Body is of vital Acts.</P>
<P>THE Spirit of GOD acts in a very differ∣ent manner in the one Case, from what he doth in the other. He may indeed act <HI>upon</HI> the Mind of a natural Man; but he acts <HI>in</HI> the Mind of a Saint as an <HI>indwelling vital Principle.</HI> He acts upon the Mind of an un∣regenerate Person as an <HI>extrinsick occasional Agent</HI>; for in acting upon them he doth not unite himself to them; for notwithstanding all his Influences that they may be the Subjects of, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re still <HI>sensual having not the Spirit. Jude</HI> 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ But he unites himself with the Mind of a Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, takes him for his Temple, actuates and influences him as a new, <HI>supernatural Prin∣ciple</HI> of Life and Action. There is this Differ∣ence; that the Spirit of GOD in acting in the Soul of a Godly Man, exerts and com∣municates himself there in his own proper Na∣ture. Holiness is the proper Nature of the Spirit of GOD. The HOLY SPIRIT operates in the Minds of the Godly, by uniting him∣self to them, and living in them, and exerting his own Nature in the Exercise of their Facul∣ties. The Spirit of GOD may act upon a Creature, and yet not, in acting communicate himself. The Spirit of GOD may act upon inanimate Creatures; as <HI>the Spirit moved upon the Face of the Waters,</HI> in the Beginning of the Creation: So the Spirit of GOD may act upon the minds of Men, many ways, and communicate himself no more than when he acts upon an inanimate Creature. <HI>For Instance.</HI> He may excite Thoughts in them, may assist
<PB N="8" REF="003768_0011_1002591A39A249A8"/>
their natural Reason and Understanding, or may assist other natural Principles, and this with∣out any Union with the Soul, but may act, as it were, as upon an external Object. But as he acts in his holy Influences, and spiritual Operations, he acts in a way of peculiar Com∣munication of himself; so that the Subject is thence denominated <HI>Spiritual.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>THIS</HI> spiritual and divine Light <HI>don't con∣sist in any Impression made upon the Imagination.</HI> 'Tis no <HI>Impression</HI> upon the Mind, as tho' one saw any thing with the bodily Eyes: 'Tis no <HI>Imagination</HI> or <HI>Idea</HI> of an outward <HI>Light</HI> or Glory, or any Beauty of Form or Coun∣tenance, or a visible Lustre or Brightness of any Object. The <HI>Imagination</HI> may be strongly impress'd with such things; but this is not <HI>spiritual Light.</HI> Indeed when the Mind has a lively Discovery of spiritual things, and is great∣ly affected by the Power of divine Light, it may, and probably very commonly doth, much affect the <HI>Imagination</HI>: So that <HI>Impressions</HI> of an outward Beauty or Brightness, may accom∣pany those spiritual Discoveries. But <HI>spiritual Light</HI> is not that <HI>Impression upon the Imagina∣tion,</HI> but an exceeding different thing from it. Natural Men may have lively <HI>Impressions</HI> on their <HI>Imaginations</HI>; and we cant determine but that the Devil, <HI>who transforms himself into an Angel of Light,</HI> may cause <HI>Imaginations</HI> of an outward Beauty, or visible Glory, and of Sounds and Speeches, and other such Things; but these are Things of a vastly inferiour Nature to <HI>Spiritual Light.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="003768_0012_1002591BD66C7E68"/>3. <HI>THIS</HI> spiritual Light <HI>is not the suggesting of any new Truths, or Propositions not contain'd in the Word of GOD.</HI> This suggesting of new Truths or Doctrines to the Mind, independent of any antecedent Revelation of those Propo∣sitions, either in Word or Writing, is Inspi∣ration; such as the Prophets and Apostles had, and such as some Enthusiasts pretend to. But this <HI>spiritual Light</HI> that I am speaking of, is quite a different thing from Inspiration: It reveals no new Doctrine, it suggests no new Proposition to the Mind, it teaches no new thing of GOD, or CHRIST, or another World, not taught in the Bible; but only gives a due Apprehension of those things that are taught in the word of GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>'TIS not every affecting View that Men have of the Things of Religion, that is this</HI> spi∣ritual and divine Light. Men by meer Prin∣ciples of Nature are capable of being <HI>affected</HI> with Things that have a special Relation to Religion, as well as other Things. A Person by meer Nature, for Instance, may be liable to be <HI>affected</HI> with the Story of JESUS CHRIST, and the sufferings he underwent, as well as by any other tragical Story: He may be the more <HI>affected</HI> with it from the Interest he con∣ceives Mankind to have in it: Yea he may be <HI>affected</HI> with it without believing it; as well as a Man may be <HI>affected</HI> with what he reads in a Romance, or see's acted in a Stage Play. He may be <HI>affected</HI> with a lively and eloquent description of many pleasant things that attend the state of the Blessed in Heaven; as well as his Imagination be entertain'd by a romantick description of the pleasantness of Fairy Land, or the like. And that common belief of the
<PB N="10" REF="003768_0013_1002591D84451BF0"/>
truth of <HI>the things of Religion,</HI> that Persons may have from Education, or otherwise, may help forward their <HI>affection.</HI> We read in Scripture of many that were greatly <HI>affected</HI> with things of a religious nature, who yet are there repre∣sented as wholly graceless, and many of them very ill Men. A Person therefore may have <HI>affecting views of the things of Religion,</HI> and yet be very destitute of <HI>spiritual Light. Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> may be the Author of this: One Man may give another an <HI>affecting view</HI> of divine things with but common assistance; but GOD alone can give a <HI>spiritual</HI> Discovery of them.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to show,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Positively, <HI>WHAT this</HI> spiritual and divine Light <HI>is.</HI></P>
<P>AND it may be thus described, <HI>A true sense of the divine Excellency of the things revealed in the Word of GOD, and a conviction of the truth and reality of them, thence arising.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>spiritual Light</HI> primarily consists in the former of these, <HI>viz.</HI> a real sense and appre∣hension of the divine Excellency of things re∣vealed in the Word of GOD. A spiritual and saving Conviction of the truth and reality of these things, arises from such a sight of their divine Excellency and Glory, so that this Con∣viction of their truth is an effect and natural consequence of this sight of their divine Glory. There is therefore in this <HI>spiritual Light,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A true sense of the divine and superlative excellency of the things of Religion</HI>; a real sense of the excellency of GOD, and JESUS CHRIST,
<PB N="11" REF="003768_0014_1002591F2E0F7160"/>
and of the work of Redemption, and the ways and works of GOD revealed in the Gos∣pel. There is a <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>superlative</HI> Glory in these things; an Excellency that is of a vastly higher Kind, and more sublime Nature, than in other things; a Glory greatly distin∣guishing them from all that is earthly and temporal. He that is spiritually <HI>enlightened</HI> truly apprehends and sees it, or has a sense of it. He don't meerly rationally believe that GOD is Glorious, but he has a sense of the Gloriousness of GOD in his Heart. There is not only a rational belief that GOD is holy, and that Holiness is a good thing; but there is a sense of the Loveliness of GOD's Holiness. There is not only a speculatively judging that GOD is gracious, but a sense how amiable GOD is upon that Account; or a sense of the Beauty of this divine Attribute.</P>
<P>THERE is a twofold Understanding or Knowledge of Good, that GOD has made the Mind of Man capable of. The <HI>First,</HI> that which is meerly <HI>speculative</HI> or <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal</HI>▪ As when a Person only speculatively judges, that any thing is, which by the Agreement of Man∣kind, is called Good or Excellent, <HI>viz.</HI> that which is most to general Advantage, and be∣tween which and a Reward there is a sui∣tableness; and the like. And the <HI>other</HI> is that which consists in the sense of the Heart: As when there is a sense of the Beauty, Ami∣ableness, or Sweetness of a thing; so that the Heart is sensible of Pleasure and Delight in the presence of the <HI>Idea</HI> of it. In the <HI>for∣mer</HI> is exercised meerly the speculative Faculty, or the Understanding strictly so called, or as spoken of in Distinction from the Will or Dis∣position

of the Soul. In the <HI>latter</HI> the Will, or Inclination, or Heart, are mainly concern'd.</P>
<P>THUS there is a Difference between <HI>having an Opini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> that GOD is holy and gracious, and <HI>having a sense</HI> of the Loveliness and Beau∣ty of that Holiness and Grace. There is a Dif∣ference between <HI>having a rational Judgment</HI> that Honey is sweet, and <HI>having a</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of its sweetness. A Man may have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that knows not how Honey tasts; but a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n can't have the <HI>Latter,</HI> unless he has an <HI>Idea</HI> of the tast of Honey in his Mind. So there is a difference between <HI>believing</HI> that a Person is Beautiful, and <HI>having</HI> a sense of his Beauty. The <HI>Former</HI> may be obtain'd by hear-say, but the <HI>Latter</HI> only by seeing the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣nance. There is a wide difference between meer <HI>speculative, rational Judging</HI> any thing to be excellent, and <HI>having</HI> a sense of its Sweet∣ness, and Beauty. The <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmer</HI> rests only in the Head, Speculation only is concern'd in it; but the Heart is concern'd in the <HI>Latter.</HI> When the Heart is sensible of the Beauty and Amiableness of a Thing, it necessarily feels Pleasure in the Apprehension. It is implied in a Persons being heartily sensible of the Loveliness of a thing, that the <HI>Idea</HI> of it is sweet and pleasant to his Soul; which is a far different thing from having a rational Opinion that it is excellent.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THERE arises from this</HI> sense of divine Excellency of Things contain'd in the Word of GOD, <HI>a Conviction of the Truth and Reality of them: and that either</HI> indirectly, <HI>or</HI> directly.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003768_0016_10025925863AA290"/>First, <HI>Indirectly,</HI> and that two ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AS the Prejudices that are in the Heart, against</HI> the truth of divine things, <HI>are hereby rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved; so that the Mind becomes susceptive of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce of rational Arguments f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r their Truth.</HI> The Mind of Man is naturally full of <HI>Prejudices against the Truth of divine Things</HI>: It is full of Enmity against the Doctrines of the Gospel; which is a disadvantage to those <HI>Arguments</HI> that prove their <HI>Truth,</HI> and causes them to lose their Force upon the Mind. But when a Person has discovered to him the divine excellency of Christian Doctrines, this destroys the Enmity, removes those <HI>Prejudices,</HI> and sanctifys the Reason, and causes it to lie open to the <HI>Force of Arguments for their Truth.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE was the different Effect that CHRIST's Miracles had to convince the Dis∣ciples, from what they had to convince the Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bes and Pharisees. Not that they had a stronger Reason, or had their Reason more improved; but their Reason was sanctified, and those blinding <HI>Prejudices,</HI> that the Scribes and Pharisees were under, were removed by the sense they had of the Excellency of CHRIST, and his Doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t only removes the Hindrances of Rea∣son, but p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sitively helps Reason.</HI> It makes even the speculative Notions the more lively. It engages the attention of the Mind, with the more Fixedness and Intenseness to that Kind of Objects; which causes it to have a clearer View of them, and enables it more clearly to see their mutual Relations, and occasions
<PB N="14" REF="003768_0017_1002592851E59AA0"/>
it to take more Notice of them. The <HI>Ideas</HI> themselves that otherwise are dim, and obscure, are by this Means impress'd with the greater Strength, and have a Light cast upon them; so that the Mind can better judge of them. As he that beholds the Objects on the Face of the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, when the Light of the Sun is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast upon them, is under greater Advantage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscern them in their true Forms, and mu∣tual Relations, than he that sees them in a dim Star-light or Twilight.</P>
<P>The Mind having a sensibleness of the Ex∣cellency of divine Objects, dwells upon them with Delight; and the Powers of the Soul are more awaken'd, and enliven'd to employ them∣selves in the Contemplation of them, and exert themselves more fully and much more to Purpose. The Beauty and Sweetness of the Objects draws on the Faculties, and draws forth their Exercises: So that Reason it self is under far greater Advantages for its proper and free Exercises, and to attain its proper End, free of Darkness and Delusion. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A true sense of the divine Excel∣lency of the Things of GOD's Word doth more <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>immediately</HI> convince of the Truth of them; And that because the Ex∣cellency of these Things is so superlative. There is a Beauty in them that is so divine and Godlike, that is greatly and evidently distinguishing of them from things meerly hu∣man, or that Men are the Inventors and Au∣thors of; a Glory that is so high and great, that when clearly seen, commands Assent to their Divinity, and Reality. When there is an actual and lively Discovery of this Beauty
<PB N="15" REF="003768_0018_1002592AC9DFAA08"/>
and Excellency, it won't allow of any such Thought as that it is an human Work, or the Fruit of Mens Invention. This Evidence, that they, that are spiritually <HI>enlightned,</HI> have of the Truth of the things of Religion, is a Kind of <HI>intuitive</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> Evidence. They believe the Doctrines of GOD's Word to be divine, because they see Divinity in them, i. e. They see a divine, and transcend∣ent, and most evidently distinguishing Glory in them; such a Glory as, if clearly seen, don't leave Room to doubt of their being of GOD, and not of Men.</P>
<P>SUCH a Conviction of the Truth of Re∣ligion as this, arising, these Ways, from a sense of the divine Excellency of them, is that true spiritual Conviction, that there is in saving Faith. And this Original of it, is that by which it is most essentially distinguished from that common assent, which unregenerate Men are capable of.</P>
<P N="2">II. I Proceed now to the second Thing proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> To show <HI>how this Light is Im∣mediately given by GOD, and not obtain'd by natural Means.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS not intended that the natural Facul∣ties are not made Use of in it.</HI> The <HI>natural Faculties</HI> are the Subject of this Light: And they are the Subject in such a Manner, that they are not meerly pasive, but active in it; the Acts and Exercises of Man's Understand∣ing are concern'd and made use of in it. GOD in letting in this <HI>Light</HI> into the Soul, deals with Man according to his Nature, or as a rational Creature; and makes Use of his
<PB N="16" REF="003768_0019_1002592D47CA4EF8"/>
human <HI>Faculties.</HI> But yet this <HI>Light</HI> is not the less <HI>immediately</HI> from GOD for that; tho' the <HI>Faculties are made Use of,</HI> 'tis as the Sub∣ject and not as the Cause; and that acting of the <HI>Faculties</HI> in it, is not the Cause, but is either implied in the Thing it self, (in the <HI>Light</HI> that is imparted) or is the Conse∣quence of it. As the Use that we make of our Eyes in beholding various Objects, when the Sun arises, is not the Cause of the Light that discovers those Objects to us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'TIS not intended that outward Means have no Concern in this Affair.</HI> As I have observed already, 'tis not in this Affair, as it is in Inspiration, where new Truths are sug∣gested: for here is by this <HI>Light</HI> only given a due Apprehension of the same Truths that are revealed in the Word of GOD; and therefore it is not given without the Word. The Gospel is made Use of in this Affair: This <HI>Light</HI> is the <HI>Light of the Glorious Gospel of CHRIST</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. The Gospel is as a Glass, by which this <HI>Light</HI> is conveyed to us. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. <HI>Now we see through a Glass</HI>— But,</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN it is said that this <HI>Light</HI> is given immediately by GOD, and not obtained by natural Means, <HI>hereby is intended, that 'tis given by GOD without making Use of any Means that operate by their own Power, or a natural Force.</HI> GOD makes Use of Means; but 'tis not as mediate Causes to produce this Effect. There are not truly any second Causes of it; but it is produced by GOD <HI>immediately.</HI> The Word of GOD is no proper Cause of this Effect: It don't operate by any <HI>natural Force</HI> in it. The Word of GOD is only made Use
<PB N="17" REF="003768_0020_1002592ED3352128"/>
of to convey to the Mind the Subject matter of this saving Instruction: And this indeed it doth convey to us by <HI>natural Force</HI> or In∣fluence. It conveys to our Minds these and those Doctrines; it is the Cause of the Notion of them in our Heads, but not of the sense of the divine Excellency of them in our Hearts. Indeed a Person can't have <HI>spiritual Light</HI> with∣out the Word. But that don't argue, that the Word properly causes that <HI>Light.</HI> The Mind can't see the Excellency of any Doctrine, un∣less that Doctrine be first in the Mind; but the seeing the Excellency of the Doctrine may be immediately from the Spirit of GOD▪ tho' the conveying of the Doctrine or Proposition it self may be by the Word. So that the No∣tions that are the Subject matter of this <HI>Light,</HI> are conveyed to the Mind by the Word of GOD; but that due sense of the Heart, wherein this <HI>Light</HI> formally consists, is immedi∣ately by the Spirit of GOD. As <HI>for Instance,</HI> that Notion that there is a CHRIST, and that CHRIST is holy and gracious, is con∣veyed to the Mind by the Word of GOD: But the sense of the Excellency of CHRIST by reason of that Holiness and Grace, is ne∣vertheless immediately the Work of the HO∣LY SPIRIT. I come now,</P>
<P N="3">III TO show <HI>the Truth of the Doctrine</HI>; that is to show <HI>that there is such a Thing as that spiritual Light that has been described, thus immediately let into the Mind by GOD.</HI> And here I would shew briefly, that this Doctrine is both <HI>scriptural,</HI> and <HI>rational.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> 'TIS <HI>SCRIPTURAL.</HI> My Text is not only full to the Purpose, but 'tis a Doc∣trine
<PB N="18" REF="003768_0021_100203DD342DA698"/>
that the Scripture abounds in. We are there abundantly taught, that the Saints differ from the Ungodly in this, that they have the Knowlege of GOD, and a sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of GOD, and of JESUS CHRIST. I shall mention but sew Texts of many; 1 John 3.6. <HI>Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, nor known him.</HI> 3 John 11. <HI>He that doth Good, is of GOD; but he th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t doth Evil, hath not seen GOD.</HI> John 14.19. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> world seeth me no more; but ye see me.</HI> John 17.3. <HI>And this is Eternal Life, that they might know thee, the only true GOD, and JE∣SUS CHRIST whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u hast sent.</HI> This Know∣lege, or sight of GOD and CHRIST, can't be a meer speculative Knowlege; because it is spoken of as a seeing and knowing, wherein they differ from the Ungodly. And by these Scriptures it must not only be a different Knowlege in Degree and Circumstances, and different in its Effects; but it must be entirely different in Nature and Kind.</P>
<P>AND this Light and Knowlege is always spoken of as immediately given of GOD Mat. 11.25, 26, 27. <HI>At that time JESUS answered and said, I thank thee O Father Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes; even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no Man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</HI> Here this Effect is ascribed alone to the arbitrary Operation, and Gift of GOD, bestowing this Knowlege on whom he will, and distinguishing those with it, that have the least natural Advantage or Means for Knowlege,
<PB N="19" REF="003768_0022_1002593599CA5B20"/>
even <HI>Babes,</HI> when it is denied to the <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Prudent.</HI> And the imparting the Knowlege of GOD is here appropriated to the Son of GOD, as his sole Prerogative. And again, 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>For GOD who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowlege of the Glory of GOD in the Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of JESUS CHRIST.</HI> This plainly shows, that there is such a thing as a discovery of the divine su∣perlative Glory and Excellency of GOD and CHRIST; and that peculiar to the Saints: and also that 'tis as immediately from GOD, as Light from the Sun: and that 'tis the im∣mediate Effect of his Power and Will, for 'tis compared to GOD's creating the Light by his powerful Word in the beginning of the Creation; and is said to be by the Spirit of the LORD, in the eighteenth verse of the preceeding Chapter. GOD is spoken of as giving the Knowlege of CHRIST in Conver∣sion, as of what before was hidden and unseen in that Gal. 1.15, 16. <HI>But when it pleased GOD, who separated me from my Mothers Womb, and called me by his Grace, to reveal his Son in me</HI>—. The Scripture also speaks plainly of such a Knowlege of the Word of GOD, as has been described, as the immediate gift of GOD Psal. 119.18. <HI>Open th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law.</HI> What could the Psalmist mean, when he begged of GOD to <HI>open</HI> his <HI>Eyes</HI>? was he ever blind? might he not have Resort to the Law and see every Word and Sentence in it when he pleased? And what could he mean by those <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndrous Things</HI>? was it the wonderful Stories of the
<PB N="20" REF="003768_0023_10025937259045A0"/>
Creation, and Deluge, and Israel's passing thro' the red Sea, and the like? were not his Eyes open to read these strange things when he would? Doubtless by <HI>wondrous Things in GOD's Law,</HI> he had Respect to those distinguishing and wonderful Excellencies, and marvell us Ma∣nifestations of the divine Perfections, and Glory, that there was in the Commands and Doctrines of the Word, and those Works and Counsels of GOD that were there revealed. So the Scripture speaks of a Knowlege of GOD's Dis∣pensation, and Covenant of Mercy, and Way of Grace towards his People, as peculiar to the Saints, and given only by GOD, Psal. 25.14. <HI>The Secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>AND that a true and saving Belief of the Truth of Religion is that which arises from such a Discovery, is also what the Scripture teaches. As John 6.40. <HI>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one that SEETH the Son, and BELIEVETH on him, may have everlasting Life.</HI> Where it is plain that a true Faith is what arises from a spiritual sight of CHRIST. And John 17.6, 7, 8. <HI>I have mani∣fested thy Name unto the Men which then gavest me out of the World—. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me, are of thee; for I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have receiv∣ed them, and known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</HI> Where CHRIST's <HI>manifesting</HI> GOD's <HI>Name</HI> to the Disciples, or giving them the Knowlege of God, was that whereby they knew that
<PB N="21" REF="003768_0024_10025938AB428238"/>
CHRIST's Doctrine was <HI>of GOD,</HI> and that CHRIST himself was <HI>of</HI> him, proceeded <HI>from</HI> him, and was <HI>sent</HI> by him. Again John 12.44, 45, 46 <HI>JESUS cried and sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that</HI> believeth <HI>on me,</HI> believeth <HI>not on me, but on him that sent me; and be that</HI> seeth <HI>me</HI> seeth <HI>him that sent me. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a</HI> Light <HI>into the World, that whosoever</HI> Believeth <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n me should not abide in</HI> Darkness. There Believing in CHRIST and spiritually See∣ing him, are spoken of as running parallel.</P>
<P>CHRIST condemns the Jews, that they did not know that he was the MESSIAH, and that his Doctrine was true, from an inward distin∣guishing Tast and Relish of what was divine, in <HI>Luke</HI> 12 56, 57. He having there blamed the Jews, that though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>discern the Face of the Sky and of the Earth,</HI> and Signs of the Wea∣ther, that yet they could not <HI>discern</HI> those <HI>Times</HI>; or as 'tis expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed in <HI>Matthew, the Signs of</HI> those <HI>Times</HI>; He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>yea and why even of your own selves, judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not what is right</HI>? i. e. without extrinsick <HI>Signs.</HI>
<Q>Why have ye not that sense of true Excellency, whereby ye may distin∣guish that which is holy and divine? Why have ye not that savour of the things of GOD, by which you may see the distinguishing Glo∣ry, and evident Divinity of me and my Doc∣trine?</Q></P>
<P>THE Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> mentions it as what gave them (the Apostles,) good and well ground∣ed Assurance of the Truth of the Gospel, that they had seen the divine Glory of CHRIST. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.16. <HI>For we have not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wed cunning∣ly devised Fables, when we made known unto you,
<PB N="22" REF="003768_0025_1002593A5D183630"/>
the Power and Coming of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Lord JESUS CHRIST, but were Eye-witnesses of his Majesty.</HI> The A∣postle has Respect to that visible Glory of CHRIST which they saw in his Transfigura∣tion: That Glory was so divine having such an ineffable Appearance and semblance of di∣vine Holiness, Majesty, and Grace, that it evi∣dently denoted him to be a divine Person. But if a sight of CHRIST's outward Glory might give a rational Assurance of his Divinity, why may not an Apprehension of his spiritu∣al Glory do so too. Doubtless CHRIST's sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ritual Glory is in itself as distinguishing, and as plainly shewing his Divinity, as his outward Glory; and a great deal more: for his spi∣ritual Glory is that wherein his Divinity con∣sists; and the outward Glory of his Transfi∣guration shew'd him to be divine, only as it was a Remarkable Image or Representation of that spiritual Glory. Doubtless therefore he that has had a clear sight of the spiritual Glory of CHRIST, may say, I <HI>have not followed cun∣ningly devised Fables, but</HI> have been <HI>an Eye-wit∣ness of his Majesty,</HI> upon as good Grounds as the Apostle, when he had Respect to the out∣ward Glory of Christ, that he had seen. But this brings me to what was proposed next <HI>viz.</HI> to show that,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THIS Doctrine is RATIONAL.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'TIS rational <HI>to suppose that there is really such an Excellency in divine things, that is so transcendent and exceedingly different from what is in other things, that if it were seen would most evi∣dently distinguish them.</HI> We can't <HI>rationally</HI> doubt
<PB N="23" REF="003768_0026_1002593CD8588758"/>
but that Things that are <HI>divine,</HI> that appertain to the supreme Being, are vastly different from Things that are <HI>human</HI>; that there is that God∣like, high, and glorious Excellency in them, that does most remarkably difference them from the things that are of Men; insomuch that if the difference were but seen, it would have a convincing, satisfying influence upon any one, that they are what they are, viz. <HI>divine.</HI> What Reason can be offered against it? Unless we would argue that GOD is not remarkably dis∣tinguished in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Men.</P>
<P>IF CHRIST should now appear to any One, as he did on the Mount at his Transfiguration; or if he should appear to the World in the Glo∣ry that he now appears in in Heaven, as he will do at the Day of Judgment; without doubt, the Glory and Majesty that he would appear in, would be such as would satisfy every One, that he was a divine Person, and that Religion was true: And it would be a most reasonable, and well grounded Conviction too. And why may there not be that Stamp of Divinity, or divine Glory on the word of GOD, on the Scheme and Doctrine of the Gospel, that may be in like man∣ner distinguishing and as <HI>rationally</HI> convincing, provided it be but seen? 'Tis rational to sup∣pose, that when GOD speaks to the World, there should be something in his Word or Speech vast∣ly different from Men's Word. Supposing that GOD never had spoken to the World, but we had Notice that He was about to do it; that he was about to Reveal himself from Heaven, and speak to us immediately himself, in divine Speeches or Discourses, as it were from his own
<PB N="24" REF="003768_0027_1002593E5F015CD8"/>
Mouth; or that he should give us a Book of his own inditing; after what manner should we expect that he would speak? Would it not be <HI>rational</HI> to suppose, that his Speech would be exceeding different from Men's Speech, that he should speak like a GOD; that is, that there should be such an Excellency and sublimity in his Speech or Word, such a Stamp of Wisdom, Holiness, Majesty, and other divine Perfections, that the word of Men, yea of the wisest of Men, should appear mean and base in Comparison of it? Doubtless it would be thought <HI>rational</HI> to expect this, and <HI>unreasonable</HI> to think otherwise. When a wise Man speaks in the Exercise of his Wisdom, there is something in every thing he says, that is very distinguishable from the Talk of a little Child. So, without doubt, and much more, is the Speech of GOD, (if there be any such Thing as the Speech of GOD,) to be distinguish∣ed from that of the wisest of Men; agreable to <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.28, 29. GOD having there been re∣proving the false Prophets that prophesied in his Name, and pretended that what they spake was his Word, when indeed it was their own Word, says, <HI>The Prophet that hath a Dream, let him tell a Dream; and he that hath my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully: WHAT IS THE CHAFF TO THE WHEAT? Saith the LORD. Is not my Word like as a Fire, saith the LORD, and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IF there be such a distinguishing Excellency in divine things; 'tis</HI> rational <HI>to suppose that there may be such a thing as seeing it.</HI> What should hinder but that it may be seen? 'Tis no Argu∣ment that there is no such Thing as such a
<PB N="25" REF="003768_0028_10025940D1293428"/>
distinguishing Excellency, or that, if there be, that it can't be seen, that some don't see it; tho' they may be discerning Men in temporal Mat∣ters. It is not <HI>rational</HI> to suppose, if there be any such Excellency in divine Things, that wick∣ed Men should see it. 'Tis not <HI>rational</HI> to sup∣pose, that those whose Minds are full of spiritual Pollution, and under the Power of filthy Lusts, should have any Relish or Sense of divine Beau∣ty, or Excellency; or that their Minds should be susceptive of that <HI>Light</HI> that is in its own Na∣ture so pure and heavenly. It need not seem at all strange, that Sin should so blind the Mind, seeing that Mens particular natural Tempers and Dispositions will so much blind them in secular Matters; as when Mens natural Temper is me∣lancholly, jealous, fearful, proud, or the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>'TIS</HI> rational <HI>to supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that this Knowlege should be given immediately by GOD, and not be obtain'd by natural means.</HI> Upon what account should it seem <HI>unreasonable,</HI> that there should be any <HI>immediate</HI> Communication between GOD and the Creature? 'Tis strange that Men should make any matter of difficulty of it. Why should not He that made all things, still have some∣thing <HI>immediately</HI> to do with the Things that he has made? Where lies the great difficulty, if we own the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng of a GOD, and that he cre∣ated all things out of Nothing, of allowing some immediate Influence of GOD on the Creation still. And if it be <HI>reasonable</HI> to suppose it with Respect to any Part of the Creation, 'tis Espe∣cially so with Respect to reasonable intelligent Creatures; who are next to GOD in the Gra∣dation of the different Orders of Beings, and
<PB N="26" REF="003768_0029_10025942587DC298"/>
whose Business is most <HI>immediately</HI> with GOD; who were made on Purpose for those Exercises that do respect God, and wherein they have <HI>nextly</HI> to do with God: for <HI>Reason</HI> teaches that Man was made to serve and glorify his Creator. And if it be <HI>rational</HI> to suppose that GOD immediately communicates himself to Man in any Affair, it is in this. 'Tis <HI>rational</HI> to sup∣pose that GOD would reserve that Knowlege and Wisdom, that is of such a divine and ex∣cellent Nature, to be bestowed <HI>immediately</HI> by himself, and that it should not be left in the Power of second Causes. Spiritual Wisdom and Grace is the highest and most <HI>excellent</HI> Gift that ever GOD bestows on any Creature: In this the highest Excellency and Perfection of a rati∣onal Creature consists. 'Tis also immensely the most <HI>important</HI> of all divine Gifts: 'Tis that where∣in Mans Happiness consists, and on which his everlasting Welfare depends. How <HI>rational</HI> is it to suppose that GOD, however he has left mean∣er Goods and lower Gifts to second Causes, and in some sort in their Power, yet should reserve this most excellent, divine, and important of all divine Communications, in his own Hands, to be bestowed <HI>immediately</HI> by himself, as a thing too great for second Causes to be concern'd in? 'Tis <HI>rational</HI> to suppose that this B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting should be <HI>immediately</HI> from GOD; for there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Benefit that is in it self so nearly related to the divine Nature, there is nothing the Creature re∣ceives that is so much <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>of</HI> his Nature, so much a Participation of the Deity: 'Tis a Kind of Emanation of GOD's Beauty, and is re∣lated to GOD as the Light is to the Sun. 'Tis therefore congruous and fit that when it is given
<PB N="27" REF="003768_0030_10025945C825CCD8"/>
of GOD, it should be nextly from himself, and by himself, according to his own Sovereign Will.</P>
<P>'TIS <HI>rational</HI> to suppose, that it should be be∣yond a Man's Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o obtain this Knowlege, and <HI>Light,</HI> by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eer Strength of natural Reason; for 'tis not a Thing that belongs to Reason, to see the Beauty and Loveliness of spiritual things; it is not a speculative thing, but depends on the Sense of the Heart. Rea∣son indeed is necessary in order to it, as 'tis by Reason only that we are become the Sub∣jects of the means of it; which means I have already shown to be necessary in order to it, though they have no proper causal Influence in the Affair. 'Tis by Reason, that we become possessed of a notion of those Doctrines that are the Subject Matter of this <HI>divine Light</HI>; and Reason may many ways be indirectly, and re∣motely an Advantage to it. And Reason has also to do in the Acts that are immediately con∣sequent on this Discovery: A seeing the Truth of Religion from hence, is by Reason; though it be but by one step, and the Inference be im∣mediate. So Reason has to do in that accept∣ing of, and trusting in CHRIST, that is conse∣quent on it. But if we take Reason strictly, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Faculty of mental Perception in general, but for Ratiocination, or a Power of Inferring by Arguments; I say if we take Reason thus, the perceiving of spiritual Beauty and Excel∣lency no more belongs to Reason, than it be∣longs to the Sense of feeling to perceive Co∣lours, or to the Power of seeing to perceive the Sweetness of Food. It is out of Reason's Pro∣vince to perceive the Beauty or Loveliness of any thing: Such a Perception don't belong
<PB N="28" REF="003768_0031_1002594836328300"/>
to that Faculty. Reason's Work is to perceive Truth, and not Excellency. 'Tis not Ratioci∣ation that gives Men the Perception of the Beauty and Amiableness of a Countenance; tho' it may be many ways indirectly an ad∣vantage to it; yet 'tis no more Reason that immediately perceives it, than it is Reason that perceives the Sweetness of Honey: It depends on the Sense of the Heart. Reason may determine that a Countenance is Beauti∣ful to others, it may determine that Honey is sweet to others; but it will never give me a Perception of its Sweetness.</P>
<P>I will conclude with a very brief <HI>Improve∣ment</HI> of what has been said.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> THIS Doctrine may lead us <HI>to re∣flect</HI> on the Goodness of GOD, that has so ordered it, that a saving Evidence of the Truth of the Gospel is such, as is attainable by Persons of mean Capacities, and Advan∣tages, as well as those that are of the great∣est Parts and Learning. If the Evidence of the Gospel depended only on History, and such Reasonings as learned Men only are capable of, it would be above the Reach of far the greatest part of Mankind. But Per∣sons, with but an ordinary Degree of Know∣lege, are capable without a long and subtil Train of Reasoning, to see the divine Excel∣lency of the things of Religion: They are capable of being taught by the Spirit of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as learned Men. The Evidence that is this Way obtained, is vastly better and more satisfying, than all that can be obtain'd by the Arguings of those that are most Lear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB N="29" REF="003768_0032_10025949E82494B0"/>
and greatest Masters of Reason. And Babes are as capable of knowing these things, as as the wise and prudent; and they are often hid from these, when they are revealed to those. 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. <HI>For ye see your Calling Brethren, how that not many wise Men, after the Flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But GOD hath chosen the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olish things of the World</HI>—.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THIS Doctrine may well put us upon <HI>examining</HI> our selves, whether we have ever had his <HI>divine Light,</HI> that has been de∣scribed, let into our Souls. If there be such a thing indeed, and it ben't only a Notion, or Whimsy of Persons of weak and distempered Brains, then doubtless 'tis a thing of great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mportance, whether we have thus been taught by the Spirit of GOD; whether <HI>the Light of the Glorious Gospel of CHRIST, who is the Image of GOD hath shined into us, giv∣ing us the Light of the Knowlege of the Glory of GOD, in the Face of JESUS CHRIST</HI>; whe∣ther we have <HI>seen the Son, and believed on him,</HI> or have that Faith of Gospel Doctrines that arises from a spiritual Sight of CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> ALL may hence be <HI>exhorted,</HI> ear∣nestly <HI>to seek</HI> this <HI>spiritual Light.</HI> To influence and move to it, the following things may be consider'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is the most <HI>excellent and divine</HI> Wisdom, that any Creature is capable of 'Tis more excellent than any human Learn∣ing; 'Tis far more excellent, than all the Knowlege of the greatest Philosopher, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="30" REF="003768_0033_1002594D7A2F5708"/>
States-men. Yea the least Glimpse of <HI>the Glo∣ry of GOD in the Face of CHRIST</HI> doth more exalt and enoble the Soul, than all the Know∣lege of those that have the greatest speculative Understanding in Divinity, without Grace. This Knowlege has the most noble Object that is, or can be, <HI>viz.</HI> the divine Glory, and Ex∣cellency of GOD, and CHRIST. The Know∣lege of these Objects is that wherein consists the most excellent Knowlege of the Angels, yea, of GOD himself,</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS Knowlege is that which is above all others <HI>Sweet and Joyful.</HI> Men have a great deal of Pleasure in human Knowlege, in Stu∣dies of natural things; but this is nothing to that Joy which arises from this <HI>divine Light</HI> shining into the Soul. This <HI>Light</HI> gives a View of those things that are immensely the most exquisitely Beautiful, and capable of delight∣ing the Eye of the Understanding. This <HI>spi∣ritual Light</HI> is the dawning of the Light of Glory in the Heart There is nothing so pow∣erful as this to support Persons in Affliction, and to give the Mind Peace and Brightness, in this stormy and dark World.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS Light is such as <HI>effectually influ∣ences the Inclination, and changes the Nature of the Soul.</HI> It assimilates the Nature to the di∣vine Nature, and changes the Soul into an Im∣age of the same Glory that is beheld. 2 Cor. 3 18 <HI>But we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with pen Face beholding as in a Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> This Knowlege will wean from the World, and raise the Inclination to
<PB N="31" REF="003768_0034_1002594F0247E0A8"/>
heavenly things. It will turn the Heart to GOD as the Fountain of Good, and to choose him for the only Portion. This <HI>Light,</HI> and this only, will bring the Soul to a saving Close with CHRIST. It conforms the Heart to the Gospel, mortifies its Enmity and Opposition against the Scheme of Salvation therein revealed: It causes the Heart to embrace the joyful Tidings, and entirely to adhere to, and acquiesce in the Revelation of CHRIST as our Saviour: It causes the whole Soul to accord and Symphonize with it, admitting it with entire Credit and Res∣pect, cleaving to it with full Inclination and Affection. And it effectually disposes the Soul to give up it self entirely to CHRIST.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS Light and this only <HI>has its Fruit in an universal Holiness of Life.</HI> No meerly no∣tional or speculative Understanding of the Doc∣trines of Religion, will ever bring to this. But this <HI>Light</HI> as it reaches the bottom of the Heart, and changes the Nature, so it will effectually dispose to an universal Obedience. It shews GOD's worthiness to be obeyed and served. It draws sorth the Heart in a sincere Love to GOD, which is the only Principle of a true, gracious and universal Obedience. And it con∣vinces of the Reality of those glorious Rewards that GOD has promised to them that obey him.</P>

<L>THERE was an Hour when CHRIST rejoyc'd,</L>
<L>And spoke his Joy in Words of Praise;</L>
<L>Father, I thank thee, mighty God,</L>
<L>Lord of the Earth and Heavens and Seas.</L>

<L>The Heights, and Breadths, and Lengths of Grace</L>

<LG>
<L>But all this Glory lies conceal'd</L>
<L>From Men of Prudence and of Wit:</L>
<L>The Prince of Darkness blinds their Eyes,</L>

<L>Father, 'tis thus, because thy Will</L>
