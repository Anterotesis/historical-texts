<P>BEloved, What is here presented to Publick view is yours: for looking to the poor-Penman, as Relating to you: to the external moving Cause, as arising firstly &amp; freely from you, to the End &amp; use as centering in you, to the reason of the Publishing therof, as resting with you, and the care &amp; costs, as to that end expended by you: It must not otherwise be determined but YOVRS. Which being so▪ you have saved me the labour, of prefacing on behalfe, either of this so necessary &amp; fruitfull an exercise of Catechising, or of this present draught: or of pub∣lish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it. The present encumbrances of our new-be∣gining you know to have declined me till of late, from the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer, and mine own inabilities much more from the latter, as being rather desirous to have made use of some others labours that way, or at least-wise to have acted mine own f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eble apprehensions in a more private manner amongst our selves. But God hath moved your minds, first to see, and seeing to cause, as it must be as it is. I shall add only a word or two touching use; <HI>1.</HI> The Scripture quotations in the margent, are so severed by those distinct marks as it is not hard to discern to which answer they per∣tayn <HI>2.</HI> They are orderly set down (for the ge∣nerall) as they relate to the several sentences or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

As for the annexing of these with the Doctrine of the Sacraments, by way of Ap∣pendix, It is because the same will more suit with such capacities as are allready entered, then such as are but in their enterance. I say no more but this, If now you &amp; yours, (as is hoped) shall gain any Spiritual fruit by these poor weak Travells of mine, I have my desire: and no small encouragement, in the midst of many wilde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness-discouragements. To His Blessing therefore I commit both you &amp; yours, who is the God of all Blessing: and Rest</P>
