<P>COncerning this Sermon which is now offering it self to thy hand and heart, I must say what I am fully per∣swaded of, <HI>viz.</HI> That it containeth words of uprightness and truth, and such as to many Auditors present at the publick Preaching of it, were very acceptable: when they came warm from the mouth and spirit of the speaker, I doubt not, but they car∣ried with them sweetness through the ear to the heart of each rightly prepared hearer. To receive with affection, is good, but not all the entertainment we owe to messages, sent by the God of Salvations to his Covenant-people. Words of wisdome must be <HI>as Nails fastened, Eccl. 12.11.</HI> the word of Christ must <HI>abide,</HI> Joh▪ <HI>15.7.</HI> and <HI>dwell richly in us,</HI> Col. <HI>3.16.</HI> The helping forward of so good a work, hath occasioned a Person of Worth, eminently affected to thine, and this poor Countries best good, in subserviency to the glory of the blessed God of Truth, to adventure the publishing, of what the pious Author was well-nigh invincibly unwilling should ever have come forth. In hearing, the attention minde must hold pace with the speaker, following him through all particulars from the begin∣ning to the end of his Message: but in reading we have this ad∣vantage, that we may stay and dwell upon what we have first a minde to, and by serious thoughts and humble prayer, improve it to our good, without depriving our selves of opportunity of doing the like, with any other part of it afterward. Thou hast now a help to reminde thee of many useful (but possibly forgotten) passages. God, whose Providence hath brought this to thy hands, expecteth a sutable improvement: an awakening, humbling quickening, is the best use we can make of it. Visible benefit and fruit, is l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to prove the best expedient to ease the spirit of the too-unwilling Author, of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which an excess of modesty may have made him capable of, for being by a friendly violence thus thrust out upon the Stage. Some persons, not born, but cut out of their Mothers Wombs, have proved considerable for Action, if Histories may be credited. That Heavens blessing may make this seasonable Sermon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is the hope and shall be the humble prayer of him who is unfeignedly</P>

<HEAD>New-Englands True Interest; NOT TO LIE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Isaiah 63.8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter (to give you onely a very short view of the Context) you may take notice of these three parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Interlocution or Dialogue between Christ and his Church, contained in the first six Verses. The un∣expected appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ, in his glorious works of Vengeance upon his peoples enemies, and of Salva∣tion to his Church, it draws forth the Churches earnest En∣quiries; and these her Enquiries they draw forth Christs distinct Answers, even as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romised <HI>Jer.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Call upon me and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knewest not.</HI> Christ loves to be <HI>questioned</HI> with concerning his great works of Providence, because he desires to be <HI>known</HI> unto his people in them; and to acquaint them with the great designs he hath in hand, as here he is graciously pleased to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Acknowledgement of Praise from the Church, in the recounting, and calling to minde of eminent passages of former mercy and kindness extended to her, from <HI>ver.</HI> 7. to <HI>ver.</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Churches earnest Prayer and pleading with God hereupon, from <HI>v.</HI> 15. to the end: <HI>Look down from heaven,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Verse read, comes under the second of these Heads. Christ having declared, not only his <HI>Person,</HI> but also his present <HI>design</HI> and work to be the wonderful destruction of his and his peoples enemies, and the salvation of his Redeemed ones; The Church is presently striking upon the same string of Mercy, and that her faith and hope might be further confirmed, and her heart enlarged, she presently ecchoes unto Christ, by telling o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the former stories of his loving kindness, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. <HI>I will men∣tion
<PB N="5" REF="000156_0004_0FA2B76EC57333E0"/>
the loving kindnesses of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Now (as one aptly notes upon the place) As good Historians do not only relate meer naked matters of fact, but the persons also, and conside∣rations moving so or so, with the effects and resultances; so the Church, surveying here the loving kindnesses of the Lord from an ancient date, suggests in the words read, the <HI>Considerations</HI> upon which the Lord proceeded to be the Saviour of this people; <HI>For he said,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words of the Text may be thus divided. We have in them</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lords just expectations of his people, and that pro∣mise which he makes to himself of great things from them. <HI>He said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The influence of these things upon the Lords Saviourly undertakings with and for his people: <HI>So he was their Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Or a little more largely the words hold forth to us</P>
<P N="1">1. The best Relation wherein any people can stand, and that is to be the Lords people.</P>
<P N="2">2. That eminent Qualification which suits with such a Rela∣tion; <HI>To be children that will not lie.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Lords solemn Assertion and Consideration of such a Relation and Qualification in the people spoken of; <HI>For he said, Surely they are my people,</HI> &amp;c. He affirms such a Relation, and he solemnly expects and promiseth to himself such an answerable Qualification.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lords Engagements and Actings as a Saviour to∣wards this his peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hereupon, or as influenced by these things. Having such an expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion, and conceiving such hopes of this people, as to promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself such things from them, The Lord resolves to undertake, and doth actually engage himself, in the whole work of their Salvation: <HI>Proving</HI> them and <HI>trying</HI> them under a singular dispensation, and long continued series of mercy, which began with their Redemption out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and so was carried on through the Wilderness unto <HI>Canaan,</HI> as in the Verses following the Text is more fully declared.</P>
<P>God is here spoken of after the <HI>manner of men,</HI> as giving to himself the grounds and reasons of his own great undertaking; And therefore the expressions of the Text do no whit impeach the fore-knowledge of God, whereby he knew from the begin∣ning what the rebellions and backslidings of this people would
<PB N="6" REF="000156_0005_0FA2B76EF9635860"/>
be, even as in <HI>v.</HI> 10. we find it; but the Lord speaks <HI>as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> judging of matters, and taking up his hopes, according to the visible and apparent just grounds and reasons of things, even as a <HI>prudent and wise man</HI> would in the like case have done: for who is there that would not have promised to himself great things from a people so engaged and circumstanced, in case so great mercy and salvation were shewn to them? Now that which the Lord promiseth to himself and expects from them, is, That they would prove <HI>Children that would not lie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To lie,</HI> in the sense of the Text, takes in <HI>deeds</HI> as well as <HI>words,</HI> yea matters of fact more especially. The Spirit of God means hereby <HI>all Vnsoundness, Perfidiousness, Prevarication with the Lord,</HI> whereby we go contrary to our <HI>Engagements,</HI> and prove unfaithful to him. The word is translated in other places to <HI>deal falsly,</HI> as <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.23. and <HI>to fail,</HI> Psal. 89.33. It is to be re∣ferred unto the matters of the <HI>Lords Covenant</HI> with his people. God expects and promiseth to himself that in <HI>these things</HI> his people will <HI>keep touch</HI> with him, and <HI>not shrink.</HI> Thus the Church asserts her uprightness, by removing the <HI>Lie</HI> far from her self, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.17. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor <HI>dealt falsly</HI> in thy Covenant: the word is the same with that in the Text; We have not <HI>lied</HI> unto thee in thy Cove∣nant. This is the plain meani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of the words: <HI>They will be perfect, upright, faithful to me and with me in all the concernments of my Covenant with them; I have this good perswasion of them, and I will try them with mercy and salvation, to see how they will answer and make good my expectations of them.</HI></P>
<P>From this 8<HI>th</HI> Verse, as relating unto the next foregoing, we may briefly take up this Note:</P>
<P><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountain and fulness of all the Blessings of the people of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Observ.</HI></NOTE> <HI>it is contained in this, to have the Lord Jehovah to be their Saviour.</HI> All the <HI>loving kindnesses,</HI> all the Lords <HI>bestowings,</HI> all his <HI>great goodness and mercies</HI> mentioned in <HI>ver.</HI> 7. they are summ'd up in, and made to flow from this one thing in <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>He became their Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. From the <HI>Comprehensiveness</HI> of Salvation. It con∣tains in it all the good and blessedness of sinners, whether tem∣poral or spiritual, and that in a way of glorious Redemption from, conquest and triumph over, and destruction of what∣soever
<PB N="7" REF="000156_0006_0FA2B77388DCFF48"/>
can be found in opposition, whether by way of <HI>demerit,</HI> or as an <HI>adverse working power.</HI> Of Salvation may every poor believing Soul, or People say, and that in their worst and most distressed estate, <HI>All my well-springs are in thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. From the <HI>infinite Sufficiency of the Vndertaker,</HI> when the Lord Jehovah is the Saviour, or undertakes to become the Saviour. <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.11.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 1. Learn we then, that we are to take notice of <HI>divine Salvation,</HI> or of God as a <HI>Saviour,</HI> in all that which the Lord hath graciously bestowed upon us his poor people in this Wil∣derness. Our <HI>Churches,</HI> our <HI>Ordinances,</HI> our <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Pri∣vileages,</HI> our <HI>Mercies</HI> this day, and unto this day from the be∣ginning, they are streams issuing from this one Fountain-head, and lines meeting in this Centre, <HI>Divine Salvation.</HI> We have enjoyed them, and do yet enjoy them in a way of Salvation. Our Liberties and Priviledges they are <HI>Redeemed Ransomed Mer∣cies,</HI> malign them who will. The Price, and Power, and Inter∣cession of a <HI>Mediator,</HI> and of many precious <HI>Saints,</HI> have given and continued them unto us. Many a time have the <HI>Archers shot at them,</HI> Sins and Enemies, Satan and his Instruments have stood in opposition; but the <HI>Salvation</HI> of God hath prevailed, and doth yet prevail: so that we may make our entrance this day with that triumph of holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Luke 1.46, 47. <HI>Our souls do magnifie the Lord, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do rejoice in God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 2. Then let us continue to <HI>draw all our waters out of these wells of Salvation,</HI> the Redeeming grace, and power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah 12 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and pity, and faithfulness of the Lord our God, as a Saviour to us and with us. They are men of <HI>use</HI> indeed, that have good buckets of Faith and Prayer to let down here. Of such precious ones let the <HI>Governours of Judah say in their hearts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.5.</NOTE> <HI>that these shall be their strength, in the Lord of Hosts their God.</HI> You that can draw hence, spare no labour nor pains. The Well indeed is deep, but the Spirit of God is with you; and these waters drawn out by a lively constant acting of Faith, will abundantly recompence all our labour. By these shall the <HI>inheritance of the Lord be refreshed when it is weary</HI>; yea, in due time, they shall flow forth to be unto us <HI>a place of broad rivers and streams, where∣in shall go no galley with oars, nor gallant ship shall pass thereby,</HI> even waters of plenty and security to the Lords people. <HI>Isa.</HI> 33.21.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000156_0007_0FA2B776478F93D0"/>But there are two other Observations from the words which I mainly intend; unto which let me speak severally in the Do∣ctrinal part of them, and so joyn them both together in the Application.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="I" UNIT="observation"/> There is a time and season wherein the Lord tries and proves a people with mercies, or with salvation, under his just and righteous Expectations of them, and the promises which he hath made unto himself concerning them.</P>
<P>This is a speaking of God after the manner of men, and in this way we utter matter of truth concerning him; we speak of him <HI>things that are right,</HI> though in a way of <HI>imperfection</HI> as to our <HI>manner.</HI> As God is said sometimes to <HI>will</HI> a thing, but not according to his <HI>Omnipotency,</HI> for then it should be most certainly effected: so he is said also to <HI>expect</HI> and look for some things, and to make a <HI>promise</HI> of them to himself, but not ac∣cording to his <HI>infinite unerring Prescience.</HI> Thus the Lord saith that he <HI>looked for grapes from his vineyard,</HI> Isa. 5.2, 4. and <HI>ver.</HI> 7. <HI>He looked for judgement, but behold oppression, for righteousness, but behold a cry.</HI> So <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.7. <HI>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction:</HI> and in that Parable, <HI>Matth.</HI> 21.37. <HI>They will reverence my son.</HI></P>
<P>In this Doctrine there are three things to be spoken to.</P>
<P>First, <HI>The grounds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Expectations of God,</HI> upon which, or accordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto which, he raiseth his <HI>hopes and confidences</HI> concerning any people, so as to say of them, <HI>Sure∣ly they will be thus, or do thus,</HI> as I would have them to be or do. Now here there are these five particulars, briefly as the grounds of the Lords Expectations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The special Relation of a people unto God</HI>; or that Cove∣nant-relation whereinto the Lord brings a people that they may be His; Surely they are <HI>My people,</HI> and then it follows, <HI>Chil∣dren that will not lie.</HI> The Lord founds his whole Law, in the giving of it to <HI>Israel,</HI> upon a Preface of <HI>Interest</HI> in them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.2. <HI>I am the Lord thy God.</HI> A Parent expects more from a <HI>Childe</HI> then from any other, because of the Relation. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.14. if <HI>Israel</HI> had been no more then <HI>a servant or a home-born slave,</HI> the Lord had not expected so great things from him; but now being a <HI>son,</HI> yea a <HI>first-born, Exod.</HI> 4.22. this makes the Judge∣ments of God executed upon him for rebellions▪ and back∣slidings
<PB N="9" REF="000156_0008_0FA2B777D87A8A60" MS="y"/>
to be, though more <HI>strange and astonishing</HI>▪ yet most <HI>just and righteous.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Extraction of a people,</HI> or their descent from such and such Parents and Progenitors; when they do not onely stand in relation to God, but are born and grow up into Covenant with him, as the seed and posterity of the Lords faithful ones. This is implied in that expression of <HI>Children</HI> in the Text; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notes not onely their Relation unto <HI>God</HI> as a Father, but unto <HI>pious and religious Parents,</HI> the Lords faithful Covenanting Servants. Religious Parentage and Descent is of great moment with the Lord; hence he calls and names his people so often in Scripture from their pious Ancestors. Thus the whole <HI>Race</HI> is called <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> the <HI>seed of Jacob and of Israel,</HI> Psal. 22.23. Isa. 45.19. the <HI>Posterity of Abraham,</HI> &amp;c. Covenanting holy Parents, they are a <HI>holy Root</HI> unto their Seed, and the Lord may well expect that the <HI>Branches</HI> should be answerable unto the Root.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11.16.</NOTE> Hence the Lord solemnly calls upon his people to <HI>look to the Rock whence they were hewen, and to the hole of the Pit whence they were digged</HI>; to <HI>look unto Abraham their father, and to Sarah that bare them,</HI> Isa. 51.1, 2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The solemn actual Restipulations of a people unto God,</HI> where∣by they do more explicitly binde themselves, and come under voluntary deliberate Engagements unto God. When God hath the Vows and Promises, the Hands and Seals, the solemn Cove∣nant-Deeds of a people, now he may well expect that from such a time they will never <HI>fail</HI> him more, but abide <HI>faithful and con∣stant.</HI> Thus it was with Israel, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Deut.</HI> 26.17. <HI>Josh.</HI> 24.21, 22.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Advantages and Priviledges of a people.</HI> A people in Covenant, are a people of many Advantages, and the Lord builds his Expectations upon these, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.1, 2. <HI>&amp;</HI> 9.4, 5. God looked for grapes from his vineyard, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. because he had <HI>fenced it, and gathered out the stones, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and made a wine-press therein,</HI> ver. 1, 2. When the rain cometh <HI>oft</HI> upon the ground, the Husbandman expecteth <HI>meet fruit</HI>; and good reason, because of this advantage: <HI>fruitful seasons</HI> afforded, make us to expect a <HI>plentiful Harvest.</HI> If God be not wanting in Ordinances, in sending Messengers one after ano∣ther, in setting up Lights in the Candlesticks, in holding forth
<PB N="10" REF="000156_0009_0FA2B77808480690"/>
the Rule unto a people, and discovering the Pattern of his house to them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he will certainly expect and require singular things from them: <HI>for unto whom much is given, from them shall much be required,</HI> Luk. 12.48. Psal. 147.19, 20. Mat. 11.20, 21, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The primitive Constitution of a people, and their first wayes of walking with God according unto such a Constitution.</HI> When God made man at first, he made him <HI>upright</HI>; when God doth in a more then ordinary way of Providence <HI>form a people,</HI> and <HI>settle</HI> them to be a people to himself, there is ever that which is eminent in the <HI>primitive frame of things amongst them,</HI> which God expects that they should keep to, and never make defection from. Thus God speaks of his Vineyard, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.2. it was planted with the <HI>choicest vine.</HI> So <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>Yet I planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed.</HI> Thus also God speaks of <HI>Judges as at the first, and Counsellors as at the beginning,</HI> Isa. 1.26. <HI>David</HI> had his <HI>first wayes,</HI> 2 Chron. 17.3. and so Churches have their first wayes, when they newly come out of the <HI>forming hand</HI> of God: Now the Lord expresseth not onely great <HI>disappointment,</HI> when these first wayes are neglected, or quite altered and cast off, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</HI> but great <HI>displeasure</HI> also, and <HI>threats</HI> of punish∣ment, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.4, 5. hence are those cutting Interrogatories, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>Secondly, A second thing in this Doctrine is, <HI>The nature and tenour</HI> of this dispensation of God, to <HI>try and prove</HI> a people with Mercies and Salvation under his just Expectations of them, and promises concerning them. This we may take in three par∣ticulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When the Lord enters into Covenant with any people, this Co∣venant of his is a Covenant with Conditions. Foedus est promiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sub certâ conditione.</HI> Hence there are the <HI>Laws,</HI> as well as the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Covenant. As the Lord <HI>obligeth</HI> himself <HI>to us,</HI> so he <HI>requires</HI> something <HI>from us,</HI> and thus the <HI>Commandments &amp; Statutes</HI> of God are frequently called his <HI>Covenant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 25.10. &amp; 103.18.</NOTE> <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.28. <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.13. The Lord doth not binde himself but upon <HI>terms</HI> to any people. In the purely spiritual Covenant, establish'd with <HI>Believers onely,</HI> as there are the <HI>Laws of it,</HI> 1 Cor 9.21. so there is a <HI>sufficiency of grace</HI> provided, and absolutely engaged, that there may be a <HI>performance</HI> and obedience unto the end, and
<PB N="11" REF="000156_0010_0FA2B778DBF355A0"/>
so that Covenant can never be made void or disannulled to any that are ever brought into the bond thereof, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. <HI>&amp;</HI> 32.20. But as to that external political Covenant, which takes in <HI>A Body of People,</HI> here there is no such engagement of grace sufficient, infallibly to be bestowed for the keeping of the same; and therefore it may be and is most frequently <HI>broken and made void.</HI> God threatens to <HI>remove the Candlestick,</HI> Rev. 2.5. and often hath he done it. <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> were in the issue cast off, for breaking the Lords Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God never is, nor can he be the first that fails in his Cove∣nant with a people.</HI> Their desertion or dereliction never <HI>begins</HI> with God, but themselves, <HI>Hos.</HI> 13.9. You know the common and stated Rule in this case. Acts of pure Dominion and Sove∣raignty they begin with God, &amp; proceed wholly from him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.11, 12, 13. but acts of Justice must have the demerit of the crea∣ture to be founded upon; such is Gods forsaking of a people, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.17. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence there is a Probation-time belonging to the Covenant-state of a people.</HI> The Lord will make a <HI>triall</HI> whether they will keep and be stedfast in his Covenant, yea or no. He will not fail on his part, but he will be that unto a people which he hath <HI>en∣gaged</HI> himself to be by <HI>Covenant</HI>; He will nourish and cherish, He will instruct and teach, He will save and shine upon a people, and keep the path of a gracious Covenant, without turning aside from the same, and in such a course and way as this he will make a <HI>full proof</HI> and trial of them. He will <HI>afflict in mercy</HI> whilest his hopes of them continue; He will bring many <HI>special hours of temptation</HI> upon them one way or another; He will <HI>nourish and keep up his hopes and expectations</HI> as long as may be, untill he hath a full proof of them; and now if they <HI>fail him,</HI> there is a critical season of altering and changing the course and way of his Providences towards them. From such <HI>an hour, or day, or year,</HI> is such a person or people forsaken of God; Pro∣bation-time ceaseth, and blinding, hardning, ruining time comes in the room of it: <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.42. <HI>O that thou hadst known! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</HI> Jer. 6.27, 28, 29, 30. <HI>Reprobate silver shall men call them, for the Lord hath rejected them.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The third thing is the Reason, which shall be onely this one. Because in such a way as this <HI>the Lord, doth wonderfully

glorifie the wisdome, and sweetness, and righteousness of his Admi∣nistration and Government</HI>▪ The Cords of such a dispensation are the <HI>cords of a man,</HI> Hos. 11.4. The Lord acts towards us in a sutable way, as we are intelligent creatures, made after the image of God, capable of judging and discerning the Reason and Equity of things, and of arguing one thing from another, and choosing and preferring one thing before another. <HI>As to his Elect,</HI> the Lord reacheth their Souls with effectual grace in this way: <HI>As to others,</HI> the Wisdome and Justice and Holiness of God, shine forth in their hardning and preparation before∣hand to destruction. This is a way wherein there can be no ex∣ception laid against the Lord by any, but he alone shall over∣come in judgement. When the Lord shall triumph most in the utter ruine of a gainsaying, backsliding, despising people, yet he shall also retain the name and glory of a gracious and merci∣full God, because <HI>He often would have gathered Jerusalem,</HI> Matth. 23.37. and <HI>there was nothing more to be done to his vineyard which he did not do,</HI> Isa. 5.4.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II" UNIT="observation"/> The Lords great Expectation of his people, and the promise which he makes to himself concerning them, is principally this, That they will be children that will not lie, and so he becomes their Saviour.</P>
<P>That which the Lord doth chiefly <HI>desire</HI> and <HI>require</HI> in and from his people, that he doth chiefly <HI>expect and promise</HI> to him∣self: That which he <HI>most abhors and abominates,</HI> he <HI>least of all</HI> expects from them that are his. Now Truth is that which the Lord <HI>desires,</HI> Psal. 51.6. but the Lie is that which he hates, <HI>Prov.</HI> 6.17. <HI>&amp;</HI> 12.22. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.8, 9.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 2.</NOTE><HI>What is it to be children that will not lie?</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>The general meaning of this expression hath been already given. Such as are lying children, they are also styled <HI>cor∣rupters,</HI> Isa. 1.4. <HI>unstedfast ones, flatterers, whose hearts are not right,</HI> who <HI>keep not the Lords Covenant,</HI> Psal. 78.10, 36, 37 <HI>Trea∣cherous dealers,</HI> Hos. 6.7. <HI>A deceitful bow, Turners back,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.57. <HI>Hos.</HI> 7.16. By the contrary unto these we may know what it is not to Lie. Thus we reade of <HI>faithful children,</HI> Tit. 1.6. the <HI>Generation of the just</HI> or <HI>Righteous,</HI> Psal. 14.5. such whose <HI>hearts are not turned back,</HI> and whose <HI>steps do not decline,</HI> Ps. 44.18.</P>
<P>More particularly there are these six things that the Lord re∣quires
<PB N="13" REF="000156_0012_0FA2B77A850819E8"/>
from a Covenanting people, that this Lie may not be charged upon them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Purity of Doctrine and Worship.</HI> Mixtures and corruptions in these are expresly called a <HI>Lie</HI> in Scripture-phrase, <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.12. <HI>Ephraim compasseth me about with Lies</HI>; i. e. with false Worship. Antichristianism is therefore called a <HI>Lie,</HI> 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.11. because it is a mix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure of <HI>false Doctrines,</HI> and <HI>false Worship.</HI> There are the lies of <HI>Errour and Heresie,</HI> and the lies of <HI>Superstition and Idolatry</HI>; the Lord in his <HI>Covenant</HI> engageth his people against <HI>both.</HI> There is no Errour in Doctrine, or in Worship and Ordi∣nances, but it tends some way or other to <HI>alter, pervert, and cor∣rupt the Lords Covenant</HI> with his people. By this we are to judge of the danger of Errours and erroneous practices, and answer∣ably to watch against the <HI>infection</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Inward heart sincerity,</HI> or <HI>Covenant truth within,</HI> Psa. 51.6. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.29. <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.1, 3. This the Lord hath <HI>promised, Deut.</HI> 30.6. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. and <HI>calls for,</HI> Deut. 10.16. Jer. 4.4. <HI>and bitterly com∣plains for the want of,</HI> Isa. 29.13.

Now this inward heart sincerity it consists in <HI>Right principles,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.5. Right <HI>aims and ends,</HI> Mat. 6.22. and a Right <HI>dependance or trust,</HI> Isa. 26.3, 4. as a mans trust, dependance and shelter is, so is his uprightness and sincerity. <HI>Such as have lying Refuges are lying children.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A conversation flowing from and suiting with truth and sin∣cerity within.</HI> That the power and life of <HI>practical godliness</HI> should be entertained into the whole of our course and way before the Lord. To fail in this is to <HI>lie loudly,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.4. &amp; 4.20.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A visible and open profession and holding forth of, and witness-bearing to the truths &amp; wayes of God before the world,</HI> Rom. 10.10. <HI>David</HI> did not onely <HI>hide the word in his heart</HI>; but, saith he, <HI>with my lips have I declared all the judgements of thy mouth,</HI> Psal. 119.11, 13. The Lord Jesus <HI>witnessed a good confession,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.13. and herein we must also follow him, that we may be true and faithful unto God. The <HI>danger</HI> in this matter will not excuse us from the <HI>duty.</HI> There were <HI>an hundred forty and four thousand,</HI> Rev. 14.1. that had <HI>the Fathers name written in their foreheads,</HI> they did not conceal nor hide themselves.

To deny the name of Christ, or to wave the publick owning of truths and wayes which the Lord Jesus owns and contends for, this is to be Lying children, and dreadful will be the issue, if the word of Christ be true, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.32, 33. <HI>Mar.</HI> 8.38. Many cases there are in this matter not here to be touched upon, but if we be the Lords, and he have any delight in us, we shall not fail in the <HI>main</HI> of this duty.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Special fidelity answerable unto special trust committed.</HI> As the Lord Jesus is the <HI>one great Steward,</HI> whom the Father hath set up and appointed over all; so there are many <HI>inferiour subservient Stewards</HI> under him. Some are Stewards in <HI>higher,</HI> some in <HI>inferiour</HI> Ranks and capacities. There are diversities of gifts which are dispensed, unto some <HI>eminency of parts and natu∣ral abilities,</HI> unto some the <HI>wealth of this world,</HI> unto some <HI>a large and swaying interest in the Many,</HI> unto some <HI>Authority and Office.</HI> Now all these gifts they are <HI>Talents</HI> as well as <HI>Gifts</HI>; Gifts as <HI>freely bestowed and received,</HI> Talents in respect of the <HI>end wherefore they are bestowed,</HI> viz. that they may be improved, and an account given of them. To betray a mans <HI>trust,</HI> or not to improve his <HI>Talent,</HI> is to lie and deal falsly, for <HI>of a Steward it is required that he be faithful,</HI> 1 Cor. 4.2. <HI>As every one hath re∣ceived the gift, so we are to minister the same as good stewards of the manifold grace of God,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.10. All the Lords people are to be faithful in whatsoever trust is committed unto them, and in special <HI>Magistrates and Rulers,</HI> and so also <HI>Ministers</HI> that are Stewards in the House of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1. <HI>Luke</HI> 12.42, 43, 44.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Stedfastness and constancy, perseverence and holding out, and that in a way of fellowship and Communion with the people of God,</HI> Heb. 10.23, 24, 25.

<P N="1">1. There is nothing of <HI>Merit</HI> implied in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. There is no barre put unto the Lords proceeding some∣time with his people upon terms of <HI>Soveraignty and Prerogative,</HI> in the dispensations of his grace and mercy, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.17, 18, 19.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is to be understood of the Lords <HI>ordinary way of dealing with his people.</HI> It would be horrible presumption in us to ex∣pect and promise to our selves Salvation in any contrary way; but in this way of fidelity and faithfulness, it would be a sin∣full despondency not to hope, and expect it upon terms of free-grace.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because <HI>our fidelity and uprightness doth now exactly answer the fidelity and uprightness of God in the Covenant.</HI> Our truth doth fitly answer Gods truth and Covenant-All-sufficien∣cy, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because <HI>when the Lords people prove thus, Children that will not lie, now they are his peculiar Glory.</HI> The Lord may and doth in this case make his boast of, and glory in his people, <HI>Job</HI> 1.8. If those who have Covenanted with God, deal falsly in his Covenant, and prove Liars unto him, now they stain the glory of God, reproach and pollute his Name; but if they maintain their integrity, continue faithful and upright, now they are a Name and a Praise to him; and <HI>for Israel his glory will the Lord place salvation in Zion,</HI> Isa. 46.13. <HI>Vpon all the glory there shall be a defence,</HI> Isa. 4.5. <HI>With the upright the Lord will shew himself upright,</HI> 2 Sam. 22.26.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because <HI>this is the Aim, and shall be the final Issue of all the providential dispensations of God towards his people, to make them to be such children as will not lie.</HI> The Lord will never cease working, <HI>afflicting, sifting, purging,</HI> till he bring his people to be of this <HI>frame,</HI> although there be but a <HI>Remnant</HI> that will endure and hold out thereunto, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.23. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.25, 26, 27. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P>The Application.</P>
<P>And here I shall consider that the words of the Text are spo∣ken concerning <HI>a People, even the Body of a Nation</HI>; and so my endeavour shall be to apply the Truths delivered, unto this present Assembly standing before the Lord this day as the <HI>Body
<PB N="16" REF="000156_0015_0FA2B77CB3451B58" MS="y"/>
of this People:</HI> Such in several respects is the Capacity of this solemn Congregation, and unto you <HI>as such,</HI> my desire is to speak in the Name of the Lord. For many a day and year, even from our first beginnings hath this word of the Lord been verified concerning us in this Wilderness; <HI>The Lord hath said of</HI> New-England, <HI>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lie, so hath he been our Saviour.</HI> Upon this Basis have all the <HI>Saviourly Vndertakings</HI> of the Lord been founded in the midst of us, and upon this bottom do we unto this day abide.</P>
<P>The solemn work of this day is <HI>Foundation-work</HI>; not to lay a new Foundation, but to continue and strengthen, and beautifie, and build upon that which hath been laid. Give me leave therefore, Honoured and Beloved, to awaken, and call upon you, in the Name of him who sends me, with reference unto those <HI>Foundations</HI> that are held forth to us in the Text, for if these should be <HI>out of course,</HI> what could the Righteous do? If we should so frustrate and deceive the Lords Expecta∣tions, that his Covenant-interest in us, and the Workings of his Salvation be made to cease, then All were lost indeed; Ruine upon Ruine, Destruction upon Destruction would come, until one stone were not left upon another.</P>
<P>Let the Uses be these four.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 1. <HI>Of Information</HI>; to let <HI>New-England</HI> know what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat gracious infinitely wise, holy and awful dispensation of divine Providence is, under which the Lord hath set us and con∣tinued us unto this day. We must look upon our selves as un∣der a <HI>solemn divine Probation</HI>; It hath been and it is a Proba∣tion-time, even to this whole People. Under great hopes, and singular eminent Expectations hath the Lord our God been trying of us, and is yet trying us in the wayes of his Salvation. There is this <HI>one</HI> voice of all his Providences to∣wards us; they call aloud unto us in this language of a Pro∣bation-time, <HI>To day if this my people will hear my voice</HI>; To day if they will come up to the Lords Expectations, and answer his promises; To day, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whilest it is a day of Salvation, whilest the Lord is yet so wonderfully preserving of us, dis∣playing his Banner over us, holding underneath the Everlast∣ing Arms, and making us to taste so much of his loving kind∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and tender mercies every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Divine Expectations
<PB N="17" REF="000156_0016_0FA2B77FCBA1C498" MS="y"/>
frustrated will issue dreadfully, when the Lord shall make us know his <HI>breach of promise,</HI> Numb. 14.34. This we must know, that the Lords promises, and expectations of great things, have singled out <HI>New-England,</HI> and all sorts and ranks of men amongst us, above any Nation or people in the world; and this hath been and is a time and season of eminent trial to us. If I should say that the very world, or common ordinary Pro∣fessors expect great things from us at this day, there is a great deal of weight in it; If I say that the faithful precious suffering Saints of God in all other places, that have heard of the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Providences towards us, do expect and promise great things from us, this is farre more; But to mention the Lords own Expectations, this is most of all, these are certainly most so∣lemn and awfull. Every Expectation of God is most just and righteous. <HI>Are not my wayes equal?</HI> saith God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.29. Yes, most equal, blessed God; Bountiful and Rich hast thou been in all thy free Bestowings; equal and just art thou in all thy greatest Expectations. If we do but run over the fore∣mentioned grounds of divine Expectation, it will be sufficient to commit the judgement of this case even to <HI>our selves,</HI> as <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.3.</P>
<P><HI>As for special Relation unto God</HI>; whom hath the Lord more signally exalted then his people in this Wilderness? The Name and Interest of God, and Covenant-relation to him, it hath been written upon us in Capital Letters from the begin∣ning. God had his <HI>Creatures</HI> in this Wilderness before we came, and his <HI>Rational Creatures</HI> too, a multitude of them; but as to <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> that are Covenant-born unto God, Are not we the <HI>first</HI> in such a Relation? in this respect we are surely the Lords <HI>first-born</HI> in this Wilderness. Of the poor Natives before we came we may say as <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.19. <HI>They were not called by the Lords Name, he bear not Rule over them</HI>: But we have been from the beginning, and we are the <HI>Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for Extraction and Descent,</HI> if we be considered as a <HI>Po∣sterity,</HI> O what Parents and Predecessors may we the most of us look back unto, through whose Loins the Lord hath stretched forth the line of his Covenant, measuring of us out, and taking us in to be a peculiar Portion to himself?</P>
<P><HI>As for Restipulations,</HI> and Engagements back again to God;
<PB N="18" REF="000156_0017_0FA2B780DA8B3E08"/>
what awfull publick Transactions of this kinde have there been amongst us? Hath not the eye of the Lord beheld us laying <HI>Covenant Engagements</HI> upon our selves? hath not his ear heard us solemnly <HI>Avouching</HI> him, and him alone, to be our God and Saviour? Hath not a great part of the world been a wit∣ness of these things, even of our explicite ownings of, and Covenantings with the Lord as our God, laying this as a foun∣dation-stone in our Building; and of this we may say, It hath been a special Exasperation unto Adversaries and Ill-willers, that despised <HI>New-England</HI> hath laid claim to, and publickly avouched and challenged a special Interest in God above o∣thers.</P>
<P><HI>As for our Advantages and Priviledges</HI> in a Covenant-state here time and strength would fail to reckon up what we have enjoyed of this kinde; if any people in the world have been lifted up to heaven as to Advantages and Priviledges, we are the people. Name what you will under this Head, and we have had it. We have had <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> to lead us; we have had Teach∣ings and Instructions, <HI>line upon line, and precept upon precep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; we have had Ordinances and Gospel-dispensations the choicest of them; we have had Peace and Plenty; we have had Af∣flictions and Chastisements in measure; we have had the Hearts, and Prayers, and Blessing of the Lords people every where; we have had the Eye and Hand of God, watching and working every way for our good; our Adversaries have had their Rebukes, we have had our Encouragements, and a wall of fire round about us. What could have been done more for us then hath been done?</P>
<P>And then in the last place, as to <HI>New-Englands first wayes</HI>; what glorious things might here be spoken, unto the praise of free-grace, and to justifie the Lords Expectations upon this ground? Surely God hath often spoke concerning His Chur∣ches here, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.2. <HI>I remember the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c.</HI> O what were the open Professions of the Lords p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople that first entred this Wilderness? How did our fathers enter∣tain the Gospel, and all the pure Institutions thereof▪ and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Liberties which they brought over? What was their Commu∣nion and Fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owship in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Kingdome of Jesus Christ?

of their Zeal for God and his Wayes, and against wayes de∣structive of Truth and Holiness? What was their Humility, their Mortification, their Exemplariness? How much of Holi∣ness to the Lord was written upon all their wayes and trans∣actions? God sifted a whole Nation that he might send choice Grain over into this Wilderness.</P>
<P>Thus it hath been with us as to grounds of Divine Expecta∣tion: And therefore let us in the fear of God learn this great truth to day, and receive the instruction thereof sealed up un∣to all our souls; <HI>That the great God hath taken up great Expe∣ctations of us, and made great Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to himself concerning us, and this hath been, and is</HI> New-Englands <HI>day and season of Pro∣bation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 2. <HI>Of Examination and Conviction</HI> as to the Returns that we have made to God our Saviour; and that proof which he hath had of us, under such and so long a trial. How have we kept our selves from being <HI>lying Children?</HI> Here is solemn matter of Examination.</P>
<P>How the Lord hath carried it towards us cannot but be ma∣nifest, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.31. <HI>O generation, see the word of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. How we have carried it towards God, as it cannot lye in the dark, so it ought to abide under the most serious and practical reflections of all Ranks and degrees amongst us, and of every soul of us in special. Let it not be thought unseasonable to call upon you as a <HI>Representative Assembly,</HI> to look heedfully in∣to the <HI>glass</HI> of the Truth delivered, that we may view the pre∣sent <HI>face</HI> of things amongst us, even the <HI>face</HI> of this our pre∣sent time and generation; not as <HI>natural men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 1.23, 24.</NOTE> to forget the same immediately, but as <HI>spiritual men</HI> to retain and judge of things, and as <HI>gracious ones</HI> to lament and intercede with the Lord: O what a sad <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> hath there of later years passed upon us in these Churches and Plantations? What a fruitful production of <HI>Lies</HI> hath there been in the midst of us? of Lies in Profession and Practice, in Doctrine and in Conver∣sation? Certainly the <HI>father of Lies</HI> hath been bringing in his lies apace; the lying spirit begins to have a large walk amongst us, venting and discovering it self even to the very face of the God of Truth, and engaging the Lord deeply in the <HI>quarrel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="000156_0019_0FA2B781C4883B88"/>Children there are many in this Wilderness; A numerous Offspring hath the Lord your God given unto you: But what are we the Generation Risen and Rising up? Are we <HI>Children that will not lie?</HI> would to God it were so: Are we not rather a multitude of us, such as <HI>keep not the Covenant of our God? that refuse to walk in his wayes? that flatter him with our mouthes, and lie unto him with our tongues? because our heart is not right with him, nor are we stedfast in his Covenant,</HI> Psal. 78.10, 36, 37.</P>
<P>When ever the Lord proves a people, He is most critical in observing the discoveries that are made of them; we can in no wise lye hid under Divine Probation. Hence saith the Lord <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>How art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine VNTO ME?</HI> that is, not unto me as an <HI>Omni∣scient</HI> God that know all things before they actually come to pass; but unto me <HI>upon Probation</HI> and trial made. It is a so∣lemn thought for us to think, and a solemn enquiry for us to make this day; what are we <HI>unto the Lord our God,</HI> under all his trials of us? And it is a solemn Conviction and Charge against us, to have it spoken, as it must be spoken in the Name of the Lord this day, <HI>O New-England,</HI> thy God did expect better things from thee and thy Children; not Worldliness, and an insatiable desire after perishing things; not Whore∣domes and Fornications; not Revellings and Drunkenness; not Oaths &amp; false Swearings; not Exactions and Oppressions; not Slanderings and Backbitings; not Rudeness and Incivility, a degeneracy from the good Manners of the Christian world; not Formality and Profaneness, to loath Manna, to despise holy things, to grow Sermon-proof and Ordinance proof; not Contentions and Disorders; not an Itching after new things and wayes; not a rigid Pharisaical Spirit; not a Contempt of Superiours; not Unthankfulness and disrespect to Instruments of choice Service; not a growing weary of Government, and a drawing loose in the Yoke of God: Not these things, but better things, O <HI>New England,</HI> hath thy God expected from thee. But what hath the Lord found? Do not you who are our <HI>Fathers in the Common-wealth</HI> know? or cannot those <HI>Watchmen</HI> of the Lord tell us, whom he hath set for a <HI>Tower <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>

Certainly all these false and evil things, and that not by <HI>secret search onely,</HI> but openly and in the view of the world, hath the Lord found. Alas! how is <HI>New-England</HI> in danger this day to be lost even in <HI>New-England?</HI> to be buried in its own Ruines? How sadly may we lament it that <HI>All are not Israel that are now of Israel?</HI> How is the good grain diminished, and the chaff in∣creased? The first generation have been ripened time after time, and the most of them gathered in as <HI>shocks of corn in their sea∣son</HI>; But we who rise up to tread out the footsteps of them that are gone before us, alas! what are we?

<P>There are many among us that have even <HI>suffered many things in vain</HI>; many that having <HI>begun in the spirit,</HI> do now walk as if they were to be <HI>made perfect by the flesh</HI>; many that are gone off from God in point of dependance, looking out to secure some other friends and hiding-places to themselves besides the Lord, against those changes of times that may come; many (as we may justly fear) that would but too soon and too easily in a day of trial entertain a <HI>Lie</HI> in the Worship of God, and return to the <HI>onyons and garlick of Egypt again.</HI> How hath that evil work of Strife and Division sprung up almost every where amongst us? in which it is solemnly to be noted, that there is ever a <HI>mixture of sin and punishment</HI> going tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther: In this thing cer∣tainly we have failed the Lords Expectation; for he hath said, Surely in a Wilderness, under the eye of Observers, under such Leaders, and the free liberty of all those wayes of Order which Christ hath appointed to build up the Peace and Communion of his people, they will certainly be of <HI>one heart and soul, keeping the unit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the spirit in the hand of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

Alas! what way of God with us is there, that hath not issued in the disco∣very of the <HI>Lie</HI> amongst us?

Whilest they lived their Piety and Zeal, their Light and Life, their Counsels and Authority, their Examples and Awe kept us right, and drew us on in the good wayes of God, to profess and practise the best things; but now that they are dead and gone, Ah how doth the unsoundness, the rottenness and hypocrisie of too many amongst us make it self known, as it was with <HI>Joash</HI> after the death of <HI>Jehojadah.</HI> In a word, we that stand before the Lord this day, we have gone less with God then we did at first engage and bid him for all his kindness, and then we began at first to yield him, for all the Mercies, Privi∣ledges and Liberties of this Place. You that have tender and gracious hearts, suffer these things to affect and afflict them day by day. Verily if the load of them be not taken up and born by a considerable number amongst us in such a way, there is great fear lest it crack and sink us without remedy.</P>

<P N="5">5. Take heed of and watch against all the <HI>various steps, de∣grees, methods</HI> whereby men come to <HI>forsake and turn off</HI> from the Lord and his wayes. 1. Men use the Ordinance of God <HI>slight∣ly and carelesly,</HI> 2 King. 10.31. they dwell in <HI>Zion,</HI> but are stran∣gers to the <HI>well-springs</HI> that are there.

Now men grow se∣cretly <HI>weary</HI> of all these things, as of a garment that warms not, and bread that strengthens not; they are not tyed by the <HI>heart-strings</HI> to pure Ordinances and Worship, and to a godly Go∣vernment. 3. Now men begin to <HI>question the ground and war∣rant of things.</HI> 4. Now they hearken after <HI>Objections,</HI> and what may be <HI>cavill'd against</HI> the Wayes and Institutions of God. 5.

The <HI>Order</HI> of God both in Civils and Ecclesiasticals, duely Acknowledged, Reverenced, submitted unto in the Lord, will bring so great a blessing with it of peace, gracious guidance, a happy issue in difficult cases, and settlement, as too too often we have too much felt and carnal wisdome and too little faith to believe.</P>

<P>These are the <HI>Directions</HI> that I would leave with you in the name and fear of the great God to be thought of and put in practice.

<P N="1">1. The present work of God in these Churches <HI>it must stand or fall in our hands</HI>; for it is now devolved upon us of the <HI>pre∣sent Generation.</HI> It is true indeed God can cut us off and graft in others; He can fill his House though we were shut all of us out of doors; He can uphold his own name and glory though we were swept to the dunghill: But that <HI>individual work</HI> which hath been begun and hitherto carried on in this place, it must stand and fall with us.

<P N="2">2. <HI>What will become of us,</HI> if we fail the Lord of his Expecta∣tions? O what <HI>good</HI> shall we lose? what <HI>evil</HI> shall we bring up∣on our selves? <HI>whither shall we cause our shame to go?</HI> will God care for a degenerate Race? when the <HI>overflowing scourge shall pass,</HI> will there be any <HI>Sanctuary</HI> for us with the God of Truth?

<P N="3">3. It is not <HI>long</HI> before the Lord will <HI>finish his great works</HI> in the world: <HI>Antichrist</HI> shall be destroyed, <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved; <HI>Zion shall be redeemed with judgement, and her converts with righ∣teousness</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>I cannot insist here upon all those particulars wherein the Expectations of God and of his people are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon you; your first wayes have engaged you deeply. <HI>Magistrates and Rulers</HI> they are not only <HI>Foundation-stones,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Supporters</HI> of the Common wealth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> but they must be also <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orner-stones</HI> in the Foundation, to <HI>Couple</HI> and <HI>Vnite</HI>; They must be <HI>Healers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> And the good Lord guide you, and prosper you as to this part of your work, that <HI>such</HI> a mercy, <HI>Vniting and Healing</HI> mercy, may be called after your name.

now here and now there, but <HI>Faith,</HI> the eye and design, the hope and the heart of Faith, fix wholly upon things that are <HI>unchangeable.</HI> Secure your hearts therefore in a single dependance upon, and sole trust in God; <HI>Com∣mit your way to the Lord</HI> at all times, and do not consume away in your own fears and cares and contrivances.</P>
<P N="7">7 When you have behaved your selves with the greatest <HI>sincerity and integrity</HI> in your places, and have been able to do most for God, still look for your <HI>Acceptance</HI> with God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 6.8.9.

<P>Finally, have you not often received encouragements from the promi∣ses? hath not the Lord been present with you in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficulties? have you not been oft refreshed with the testimony of a good Conscience, that <HI>in simpli∣city and godly sincerity</HI> you have managed what hath been in your hand?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 1.12.</NOTE> have you not been a Government enquiring after the mind and will of God, given to prayer, and to advise with the Word of God and the faithful dispensers of the same? Now then go on, even this year also, <HI>in this your might,</HI> Being and Doing All for God; <HI>And He that is indeed the great Shep∣herd and Stone of Israel,</HI> shall be in the midst of you, <HI>The mighty Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellor, The Prince of Peace, upon whose shoulder the Government is and shall be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 4. <HI>Of Encouragement and Assurance</HI> to all the Lords people here in this Wilderness. Let us but prove <HI>Children that will not lie,</HI> and we shall not want <HI>Salvation.</HI> If <HI>we</HI> lie not, the <HI>vision</HI> shall not lie. Nothing but our own Lie can shut us out from the Salvation of God. Our great work lyes in this to keep from being lying children; we may now confidently leave the work of saving us with God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 33.29.</NOTE> Yea our <HI>Enemies</HI> in this way <HI>shall be found Liars unto us; Achitophel</HI> shall die in Child-bed, not being able to give life and birth to his mischievous Conceptions. <HI>Balaam</HI> may <HI>set up his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tars,</HI> and <HI>offer his Sacrifices,</HI> and <HI>seek Inchantments</HI> once and again, but without success, when the <HI>Lord beholds not this iniquity in Jacob</HI>▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 23 21. Exod. 19 4 5, 6 Isa. 26.1, 2.</NOTE> nor <HI>sees this perv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse∣ness in Israel.</HI> If the Lord preserve unto us a faithful <HI>People,</HI> a faithful <HI>Mi∣nistry,</HI> a faithful <HI>Magistracy,</HI> He will then <HI>Appoint Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks</HI> to us. It is <HI>New-Englands Lie</HI> that must open the door unto <HI>New-Englands Ruine,</HI> which the Lord for ever preserve us from, and set a <HI>double Lock</HI> of faithfulness upon all our Souls, that we may be both faithful to God, and also faithful with his Saints. I will but briefly note unto you a few particulars out of <HI>Psal</HI> 125. and so shut up all.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We have a time and season of sore trial and exercise supposed, by reason of the budding and blossoming of the <HI>Rod of wicked</HI> men, and its <HI>lying upon the Lot of the Righteous</HI> for a time, <HI>ver.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have the different and contrary behaviour of persons un∣der such an hour of temptation. Some are <HI>Children that will not lie</HI>; they are <HI>good</HI> in such evil times, they are <HI>upright in their hearts,</HI> v. 4. and they <HI>trust in God,</HI> v. 1. Others they prove <HI>Liars,</HI> they <HI>turn aside into crooked wayes,</HI> they shrink and prevarica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with God, and warp off from the strait∣ness of the Rule, and the uprightness of the Cause of God, <HI>v</HI> 5.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We have the different issue which the Lord m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes with these diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent persons. 1.
