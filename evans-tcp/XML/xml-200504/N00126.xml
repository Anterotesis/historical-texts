<P><PB N="4" REF="000181_0009_0FA3159F84673A50"/>Quest. <HI>1. How may we understand their set∣ting up Kings and Princes and not by the Lord and his Knowledge?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They did it not by his direction and approbation, they did never enquire and prosecute the minde of God in that bu∣siness, nor did the Lord know and approve their way and procedure as he doth <HI>the way of the righteous,</HI> Psal. 1. ult.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>How did they set up Kings and Princes without Gods approbation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Not meerly (as I conceive) in setting up the Kingly Government, for that was revealed to be his will eventually, <HI>Deut. 17.14.</HI> but their sin in first taking to this Government was their lusting after it out of season and measure; this itching hu∣mour in the <HI>Israelites</HI> was partly from their distrusting their God, and partly for <HI>Genti∣lizing</HI> or conforming to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and it broke forth in <HI>Gideons</HI> time, <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.<HI>22, 23.</HI> they would have a Regal Hereditary Go∣vernment, but <HI>Gideon</HI> suppresseth the mo∣tion, and oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth the making a King in other time and manner then God appoin∣ted, to be a rejecting of Gods Govern∣ment; they say, <HI>rule thou over us, thou, and thy Son, and thy Sons Son,</HI> and <HI>Gideon</HI> said unto them, <HI>I will not rule over you, neither

shall my Son rule over you</HI>; but who then? <HI>the Lord shall rule over you</HI>: But this lust in that people did afterwards rise, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udg. 9.</HI> to∣ward his Bastard Son <HI>Abime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> who had not that honest spirit to check it as his Fa∣ther did; the same lust was stirring in the <HI>Israe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites</HI> demand of a King, <HI>1 Sam.</HI> 8.<HI>5.7.</HI> and this the Lord counts the rejecting of his Government, by which formerly a fit in∣strument was designed by the Lord in every extremity, and thus far the ten Tribes did act with the other, in setting up Kings without Gods approbation; afterward I finde this sinful proceeding to reign chiefly in the ten Tribes, for they knew the will of God, for the succession of <HI>David</HI> the Type of Christ, <HI>2 Sam.</HI> 5.<HI>2</HI> yet they first set up <HI>Ishbosheth,</HI> and afterward <HI>Absalom,</HI> and then inclined to <HI>Sheba,</HI> in all which they neither sought nor had the approbation of God, and by this lust were the ten Tribes acted in set∣ting up <HI>Ieroboam</HI>; for though it was by Gods providence ordering all events, yet neither did the people, nor <HI>Ieroboam</HI> enquire of God about it, but the people in discontent rebelled against the house of <HI>Dav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ierob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣am</HI> in his ambition did match at the offer of the seditious <HI>Israelites</HI>; thus did not <HI>David,</HI> for though he was anointed King, yet nei∣ther

in <HI>Sauls</HI> time would he put forth a hand to the Crown, nor after <HI>Sauls</HI> death had made the Throne vacant, would <HI>David</HI> step one foot towards possession of it, till he enquired after, and received Gods appro∣bation, <HI>2 Sam. 2.1. David</HI> enquired of the Lord, <HI>shall I go up to any of the Cities of Iu∣dah</HI>? but <HI>Ieroboam</HI> did neither take nor wear the Crown according to Gods counsel and tearms; And so it was with the Kings that succeeded him, and for the people that set up their Kings at their own pleasure; so did they destroy them, <HI>Hos. 7.7. Being hot as an oven</HI> in their own passions and factions, <HI>they devour their Iudges, their Kings are fal∣len, there is none that calls upon me,</HI> and pul∣led down their Kings without Gods counsel or help, so that in <HI>two hundred years</HI> they had <HI>twenty</HI> Kings of <HI>ten</HI> several families; in the same time there were but <HI>eleven</HI> in <HI>Iu∣dah,</HI> and all of <HI>Davids</HI> house: Now this their setting up Kings and Princes accord∣ing to their own lusts was the more crimi∣nal, because they in word owned God to be their God in Covenant, <HI>my God we know thee</HI>; and for them to order their Govern∣ment without taking notice of God, was a great disloyalty.

<P N="1">1. Able men, <HI>Chasil</HI> speaks, ability of e∣state: <HI>Isai. 3.7. In my house is neither bread nor clothing, make me not a Ruler over the People</HI>; he should of his own have necessa∣ry subsistance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ability of Wisdome, <HI>Psal. 2.10. Be wise O ye Kings, be instructed O ye Iudges of the Earth</HI>: they should themselves be wise, or at least guided by them that are so, the want of which is noted as a cause of all publick disorders, <HI>Psal. 8.2, 5.

<P N="3">3. Ability of spirit or courage, else they will not be a terrour to evil-works, but <HI>bear the sword in vain,</HI> Rom. <HI>13.4.</HI> and this Ability is especially to be minded, when Drunken∣ness, Gaming, Unrighteousness &amp; Unclean∣ness grow bold; the Ruler had need be furni∣shed

<P N="2">2. <HI>God-fearing men</HI>; those that want the fear of God will not regard men justly and conscientiously, <HI>Luk. 18.2. The Judge that feared not God, neither regarded he men.</HI> This is <HI>N. Englands Crown</HI> that you have or may have in the Magistracy, such as fear God and hold fast, and use <HI>what you have that no man take your Crown, Rev. 3.11.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men of Truth,</HI> sincere faithful men: (1) Encouraging the good. (2) Being just men. (3) And of publick spirits.</P>
<P N="1">1. Encouraging and succouring them that are favoured of God, and study con∣formity to him, this must be the aim of Ru∣lers, who <HI>Pet. 1.2, 14. are sent forth for the praise of them that do well,</HI> and this will be their advantage, <HI>Zach. 12.5.

<P N="2">2. Being just men is a second part of the Rulers truth, he should be one that will seek and hasten justice: seek ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice, <HI>Iob 29.16. The cause which I knew not I searched out,</HI> this requires a diligent and wakeful atten∣dance: It is absurd if at any time true, that they which judge in a cause should sleep at the hearing; he that in such a case is cast, may well (as he) appeal from sleeping to waking <HI>Phillip</HI>; more vigilance is required in a cause which may sometime be covered with many blinds, and the strong current of a party, in which case just men will not therefore bear down any in his cause, <HI>Iob 31.21.

<P>Your second liberty is, that all have justice without partiality or delay, and they go well together, for warping in a cause makes de∣lay, for a right line in the shortest; it is a great sin in the Magistrate and wrath on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he

<P>But when the current of Justice in the hand and heart of just men shall run too strong for all opposition, it is more pleasing to God then the best melody of instituted Worship, <HI>Amos 5.23, 24. Take thou a∣way from me the noise of thy Songs, for I will not hear the melody of thy Viols, but let Iudgement roll down as waters, and Righte∣ousness as a mighty stream</HI>; when you are upon the seat of Judgement Christ must be nearest a kin unto you, <HI>Prov. 7.4. Say unto Wisdome,</HI> that is unto Christ, <HI>thou art my Sister, and call understanding thy Kinswo∣man, that they may keep thee from the strange woman.</HI></P>
<P>The nearer the will and interest of Christ, the more strange will, all by-wayes of in∣justice and partiality be to us; Kindred will be no Kindred: <HI>Zelucus</HI> when engaged to put out his Sons eyes for Adultery, would rather make a breach upon himself in the loss of one eye, then on the just Law to fa∣vour him.</P>
<P N="3">3. Such as are of a publick spirit to

<P N="2">2.

Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good,</HI> because the good and maintenance of so many Churches doth depend upon some wise consideration of the gifts of men here, and the commodities of the Land; therefore it is not enough on∣ly to take up that good which is obvious, but search for that which is not, and well were it as seems to me, if we had a standing Committee to relieve and weigh such pro∣positions tending to the better subsisting of the people. I finde in the fifth liberty an allowance of a Monopoly on the producing a commodity now in the Land, and I per∣ceive Magistrates and Ministers, and most of the Husbandmen will finde the want of some stable commodity, which may com∣mand supplies from abroad.</P>

<P>Fathers and Brethren, ye are now to as∣semble, being clothed with the chief Ma∣gistratical power of this poor Country; let me beseech you in the Name of the Lord, to attend healing work, and to act as those that are united as one man for the common good, that the people may be so; meddle not with any thing that may divide you in so dubious a time, remember that <HI>Gen 13▪ 7.</HI> the strife between <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI> was very unreasonable, because the <HI>Cananite</HI> was then in the Land, and therefore <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> to allay and end the strife, doth de∣ny himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wave his right; ye know my Brethren, what new neighbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have their busie Locusts will know and improve al your strife &amp; other snares for you are boasted of, therefore now is your season for self-denial: If you have any of you a thirst and longing to make any change in Church or Common-wealth, and may be you see your help in the gate, and have it in your power,

<P>Pardon me I pray you, if from what ap∣pears above-board I cannot see how men here can finde any occasion of division, if they do not on some secret cause unseason∣ably seek it; what if some Brethren have departed from a particular Church, irregu∣larly say some, regularly say others? but why should this make any noise, heat and breach in the Land, since it is not held out as an ordinary case; the like may not be seen in an age, neither is this I hope, to be a Pre∣sident, nor is it upon any different Principles, though some differing application of Princi∣ples, for it is expresly owned on all hands that the major part of a Church must issue their matters, where the rule doth not con∣tradict, neither can I understand why the question about adult Children of the Church should make any estrangement, since all godly men have the same scope to fetch in to Christ the young Generation: Some by giving those priviledges which others deny to awaken them to look out for the true and

<P>The appearance of disagreement among the Elders, will hinder the order of Chur∣ches, which we would assert, and hinder the conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of Youth which we would pro∣mote, and promote prophaness, supersti∣tion and popery, which we would hinder, hinder did I say? nay, which we would with all our might hinder and watch against, for Satans great A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taque upon the Churches seems to ly that way, and may be Satan and his instruments will blow up either real di∣vision amongst us, or the repute or report of it, that there may be a pretence of a necessi∣ty to set up a Courtier for your Governour in the Common wealth, and a Prelate or something like it in the Churches; and when Taxes and Tythes, and all kinde of vexation are upon you in your labours, and heavy burdens upon your Consciences, then you will (may be cry and not be heard, beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of your wilful drawing such things upon your s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves, <HI>1 Sam. 8.18</HI> then will you wish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>that we had hearkened to God and his ser∣vants

and had agreed,</HI> but were it not (my honoured Fathers and dear Brethren) better to work in hope for that agreement now, which we would wish for in vain.</P>
<P>Now therefore, let all <HI>New Englands</HI> friends for their comfort, and Enemies for their disappointment know, that (ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing some Exentricks) we are all general<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a∣greed in the Principles of purity and power of the Churches, and the liberty and safety of this people against all that ly in wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a∣gainst us, whether nearer or further off.</P>
<P>Bear with me I beseech you, that I have been so large in a matter which lay upon my heart with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great weight; I shall now hasten to a conclusion when I have only tou∣ched upon:</P>
<P N="4">4. Qualification of them that should be set up in Magistratical power, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Cove∣teousness</HI>; this Coveteousness which doth incapacitate a man for Magistracy, is an earnest intentiveness upon wealth and in∣crease of estate: A coveteous Magistrate, Deputy or Commissioner, will be so busie upon particular advantage, that for want of that he will think much of time and pains for publick good, and will be indulging to vice if he can gain by it, the Greek Orator could say <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (love of wealth)
<PB N="46" REF="000181_0051_0FA315BF0676D8A0"/>
is the rust of the soul, and that it is Sacriledge to get wealth from the publick, and gives even a divine rule that Magistracy is not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> not a trading and merchandize but a Ministry, he that dispi∣seth the gain of oppression, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, <HI>Isai. 33.14.15</HI> shall hold up his head when all the world is on fire, and such a fire seems kindling now, and happy are they who will shake off such gain, as a spark of hell, or a viper lighting upon them, as <HI>Paul did Act. 28.5.</HI> But now it is time to conclude, least while I should help I should hinder the work of the day, and for conclusion I would adde two words.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you have had and shall have respect to God, in constituting and administring of Magistracy, then we must be thankful to the Lord for such Magistrates that we have li∣berty to chuse such, and that we have such to chuse: Else where their Magistrates and Officers, Governour and Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r General, their Secretary, yea, their Marshal is from abroad, and the Colony have no judgement of their fitness permitted to them; yea, we must be thankful, not only for, but to such Magistrates and Deputi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that accept and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their trust, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r indeed we are behol∣den
<PB N="47" REF="000181_0052_0FA315BFC7E6CBF0" MS="y"/>
to them for so mean a consideration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is allowed, that they will put their shoul∣ders under so great a burthen in tottering and troublesome times, let all the Inhabi∣tants incourage them in their work, for all your mirth and prosperity will cease when such Rulers do, <HI>Lam. 5.14. The Elders have ceased from the Gate, the Young men from their Musick.</HI></P>
<P>If your choice and administration be not to the mind of God; exercise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for your unworthiness; your weakness in Faith, Prayer, Watching and Working, for God would have you work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut all your salvations, <HI>Eccl. 10.18. By much slothfulness the building decayeth, and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through,</HI> Prov. 12.24. <HI>The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute,</HI> all the decayes of the fair building of Govern∣ment here, all thralldome, and all your de∣structions must needs be of your selves, and your own default especially the Freemen.</P>
<P N="2">2. Exercise Faith, if ye seek the Lord, he will not cast you off, he hath expressed him∣self so in promise, <HI>1 Sam. 12.22. The Lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake, because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people,</HI> therefore howsoever matters

A∣rise</HI> O <HI>Lord, judge the Earth, for thou shalt inherit all Nations</HI>: This may awaken our cries to the Lord Jesus, Come Lord Jesus▪ come quickly, even so, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
