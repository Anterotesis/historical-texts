<HEAD>Prov, <HI>4.23.</HI> Keep thy Heart with all diligence, for out of it are the Issues of Life.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the Life of a <HI>Christian</HI> is a continued <HI>War∣fare,</HI> is a Truth, proved not only by the <HI>Infalli∣ble Testimony of Scripture,</HI> but also by the <HI>un∣failing Observation</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> of the <HI>Peo∣ple of God</HI> in all Ages; whose Entrance into Christ by Con∣version, is a listing them Souldiers in his <HI>Camp.</HI> This <HI>Warfare,</HI> being attended with so much <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger,</HI> managed with so much <HI>difficulty,</HI> and the Issue being a matter of so great <HI>Consequence,</HI> as is but darkly shadowed out by all the <HI>Warr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Com∣bustions</HI> which are upon Earth; hence the <HI>Scripture</HI> affords its spiritual <HI>Tracticks,</HI> and <HI>Directions</HI> for the prosperous ma∣nag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of this holy <HI>Warr:</HI> Commending you therefore to the <HI>Field,</HI> for the Exercise of <HI>Skill,</HI> and improving of your selves in what may belong to your <HI>Military Function</HI> as men at Arms, give me feave to Rub up your memories lit∣tle, in some plain and practical duties of a Christian Soul∣dier·</P>
<P>The words of my Text are the great Charge given by Jesus Christ, the true <HI>Solomon (Captain General</HI> of the Hosts of his People) to all those that are under his <HI>Colours,</HI> enga∣ged in his Service. That the phrases or Terms used here are <HI>Metapho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical,</HI> or <HI>Allusive</HI> to matters <HI>Military,</HI> such as are Conversant in the <HI>Original Language</HI> do understand. In the words observe four things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Subject about which this Charge is Conversant,
<PB N="1" REF="000227_0003_0FA36B650DD507E8"/>
the Heart,</HI> and that under a Limitation, or especial Intima∣tion, <HI>thy Heart,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is here Compared to a <HI>Castle</HI> or <HI>Fort,</HI> under the Service and Command of God, exposed to the Assaults of <HI>Enemies,</HI> and in danger of <HI>damage</HI> by them; and every one hath a heart of his own to which he ows a par∣ticular <HI>Respect,</HI> and over which he hath an <HI>especial Charge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Charge it self,</HI> which is given: <HI>Keep thy Heart,</HI> the word signifies, to <HI>Fortifie, Protect,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI>; to keep a thing with <HI>Locks,</HI> and <HI>Barrs,</HI> and a <HI>strong Guard,</HI> as <HI>Am∣munition</HI> or <HI>Treasure</HI> is kept, when an <HI>Enemy</HI> is expected to make an <HI>Assault</HI> upon it, see <HI>Nah▪ 2.1.</HI> A <HI>Noun</HI> from this <HI>Verb</HI> is translated a <HI>Watcher</HI> or <HI>Watch-man,</HI> Jer. 4.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and another, a <HI>Tower</HI> or <HI>place to watch in,</HI> Hab. 2.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Emphasis</HI> which is put upon this <HI>Charge; with all Diligence,</HI> the English of the Phrase is, <HI>with all keeping</HI>: or, as the <HI>Hebrew affix</HI> doth bear, and is often used, <HI>above all keeping</HI>: the word is often in Scripture Translated, to <HI>preserve</HI>; and it properly signifies to be careful to <HI>keep off,</HI> or prevent any mischief, that is likely to be done, if not lookt to; it signifies to <HI>preserve in Safety,</HI> Gen: 28 10. It is a <HI>Me∣taphor</HI> from a <HI>Watchman</HI> in a <HI>Tower,</HI> or a <HI>Garrison</HI> in a <HI>For∣tification</HI>; hence a <HI>Noun</HI> from this <HI>Verb,</HI> is Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slated a <HI>Watch,</HI> or a place to <HI>discry danger</HI> from, <HI>Hab. 2.1.</HI> and ano∣ther is that signifies the <HI>Watch,</HI> or time allotted to a several Company in their Turns to stand out upon <HI>Observation:</HI> Exod. 14.24 Lam 2.19. and another that sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fies a <HI>Watch that is set,</HI> Neh. 13.30.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>force</HI> or <HI>weight</HI> of the Charge is added: <HI>for out of it are the Issues,</HI> or <HI>outgoings of Life; q. d.</HI> if here thou be negligent, thy Life goes for it: it is the <HI>Storehouse</HI> and <HI>Trea∣sury</HI> of Life? Of all <HI>Laws,</HI> those that are <HI>Military</HI> are the most <HI>strict</HI> and <HI>severe,</HI> to put men upon the more <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Vigilancy</HI>; hence to neglect the heart is here presented as a <HI>Capital Crime</HI>: It is as much as a mans Life is worth to be <HI>Se∣dulous,</HI> and <HI>Vigilant</HI> in his Charge. Hence,</P>
<P><HI>It is the most weighty and solemn Charge lying upon every one that marcheth under Christs Standard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine.</HI></NOTE> <HI>diligently to keep
<PB REF="000227_0004_0FA36B65C6D88488"/>
his own Heart</HI>: there is indeed a great deal else which he hath to look to, as follows in the Sequel of the Chapter: his <HI>mouth, Lips, Eyes, Hands, Feet,</HI> but all this is in order, and Sub∣ordination to the <HI>Heart.</HI></P>
<P>The word heart in Scripture use, comes under <HI>various Ac∣cepta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions</HI>: It is taken properly for that <HI>Organ</HI> in the Body of a living Creature, which is the <HI>Fountain of Life,</HI> Seat of the <HI>Vital Spirits,</HI> &amp; <HI>Spring of motion</HI> &amp; <HI>Operation: Metaphori∣cally,</HI> for the <HI>midst</HI> or Inside of any thing, so, the <HI>heart</HI> or midst of the <HI>Oak,</HI> 2 Sam: 18.14. the heart or middle of the Sea by a <HI>Metonimy</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> for the Soul in general, for the <HI>wil, unedrstanding, Conscience, Affections, memory,</HI> &amp; lastly, for all the <HI>Faculties</HI> and <HI>Operations</HI> of the Soul Collectively taken, whose prime Seat is in the <HI>Heart,</HI> so in the <HI>Text,</HI> the heart of man is a little <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> or <HI>Dynasty</HI> which ows <HI>Fealty</HI> to the <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Empire</HI> of <HI>Heaven, understanding, will, Affecti∣ons,</HI> and all their <HI>Operations</HI> are to be employed in Gods <HI>Ser∣vice.</HI> The keeping of the heart here required implies, and intends both danger and duty.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Danger,</HI> or else the work were <HI>Superfluous,</HI> and this danger is twofold.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Heart is exposed to <HI>Enemies</HI> which will seek the <HI>Life of it,</HI> who are alwaies <HI>watching</HI> to make a <HI>surprize</HI>: where no Enemy needs to be suspected, no <HI>garrison</HI> needs to be <HI>kept,</HI> to train up Souldiers in times of peace, were an <HI>Emp∣ty Flourish,</HI> were it not that <HI>Warr</HI> may arise; The Spirit of God would not have us to be secure: or think our selves to be beyond the reach of <HI>spite</HI> and <HI>malice,</HI> to do us harm, but to account that we dwell among <HI>Murderers,</HI> and in the midst of <HI>deadly Enemies,</HI> who seek, and would gladly rob us of the Life of our Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. That to lose the heart to those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wait for it, is a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>sore Loss</HI>; that it is not a piece of <HI>Lumber,</HI> which is little to be Cared for, but a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owel</HI> to be preserved with utmost Care. In times of danger, it is better to draw off from, and abandon such places as are of no Consequence, then to Expend fruitless and Excessive Charges for the main∣teining
<PB N="4" REF="000227_0005_0FA36B66B2C767A8"/>
of them; where the Charge out-bids the <HI>Rational Benefit,</HI> it is foolishly laid out, it's better left to the <HI>Enemy,</HI> but is not thus in regard of the heart, and therefore we are Commanded not to seek a <HI>safe Retreat</HI> from it, but <HI>stoutly</HI> to stand to it, and upon no Terms to forgoe it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Duty,</HI> summarily Conteined in three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the Heart is to be kept for God,</HI> whose <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Prerogative</HI> it is to have the Rule over, and obedience of it: he challengeth it as his own, <HI>Prov. 23.26. my Son give me thy heart</HI>; he requires it as our duty of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> as the performance and discharge of our <HI>Sacramentum mili∣tare,</HI> to look after it, neither are we to account any Service tedious, or hazards <HI>superstuous,</HI> that we undergo in this de∣signe.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence it is to be kept from all those that would rob him of the <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Command</HI> over it, all that would usurp his Title, and Challenge to themselves <HI>Dominion</HI> of the Soul: <HI>we cannot serve two Masters,</HI> if we are for God, we must be for no other, there are many that bid much for this <HI>Rule,</HI> and would fain hold the Scepter, and have the Command of the heart; But, <HI>socium habet neminem,</HI> he must have the sole and whole ordering of it, according to his own <HI>good pleasure</HI> without <HI>Controul.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we are bound to supply our selves with all ne∣cessaries requisite for the <HI>defence</HI> and <HI>preservation</HI> of our hearts from the force or fraud of the Enemies of our Souls: what is a Souldier without Arms? or Arms without Skill? or Skill without <HI>prudent Conduct</HI>? or all without <HI>Careful</HI> and <HI>watchful Improvement?</HI> so that in all these things we are to be Furnished, that nothing be wanting, least through our defect, and heedlessness we come under the deserved blame of <HI>Imprudent</HI> and <HI>Careless Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>I shall pass over the Reasons briefly.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reason</HI></NOTE>1. From the <HI>worth</HI> or <HI>Excellency</HI> of the Heart, or Soul, this is the <HI>Nobler part</HI> of man, the most <HI>Honourable,</HI> the man is cal∣led from it frequently in Scripture, it is the most <HI>useful,</HI> take-it away, and the Body is left a <HI>Lump</HI> of <HI>unserviceable mat∣ter,</HI>

a <HI>meer piece of Corruption</HI>: it is more worth then a world, <HI>Math. 16.26.</HI> it is the <HI>Palace</HI> of the <HI>great King,</HI> the <HI>Throne</HI> of the Spirit of God, the <HI>Treasury</HI> of <HI>Heavenly Riches,</HI> if we had a Thuosand of natural Lives to lose, the Loss of all were <HI>Inva∣luable,</HI> &amp; to be despised, if Compared with the Loss of this one·</P>
<P>From <HI>the great price which was paid for the Redemp∣tion of the Soul</HI>; it was once in the hands of <HI>Enemies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> under the Power of <HI>destroying Evils,</HI> in slavery to <HI>cruel ma∣sters</HI>; but there was a great <HI>Summe</HI> laid down to procure its <HI>Ransome</HI>: It is true, Christ <HI>redeemed</HI> the whole man, Soul and Body are joyntly his <HI>Purchase</HI>; but the <HI>Soul</HI> was the great thing, hence there is an <HI>Emphasis</HI> put on that, <HI>Psal. 16.23.3.30.3.33.22.35 3.</HI> Answerable therefore to the great <HI>Cost which was laid out</HI> in Redeeming should be the <HI>Care in keeping</HI>: he that hath been once in the <HI>Enemies</HI> hand felt his <HI>Rage,</HI> tasted deep of his <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and for a great price <HI>Ranso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med,</HI> will look to himself.</P>
<P>From <HI>the many Enemies which seek the Ruine of the Soul.</HI> Satan, whose great design is <HI>at that</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> In all his <HI>Indentures</HI> which he makes with any, his <HI>Bargain</HI> is for the <HI>Soul</HI>; the drift of all his <HI>Assaults,</HI> and <HI>forcible</HI> and <HI>Po∣litick Temptations,</HI> is to deceive the <HI>Soul</HI>: the Trade which he drives is to Attempt all Courses that he may <HI>devour it</HI>: he besiegeth the <HI>Heart,</HI> and if he can but get and keep his <HI>Throne</HI> there, he is Content: As the <HI>Pope</HI> Answered to the Question, whether the <HI>Recusant Papists</HI> should expose them∣selves to suffer <HI>Banishment,</HI> or rather go to the <HI>Publick As∣semblies</HI>; let me have their <HI>hearts</HI> (said he) and let the <HI>Queen</HI> have their <HI>Bodies: Satan</HI> is willing men should do, and take pains in doing outward Services, he suffers them to <HI>read, hear, pray, give Alms,</HI> &amp;c. they may go as farr as they will in bodily Service, only let him have the <HI>Homage</HI> of their <HI>hearts</HI>: this is the <HI>strong hold</HI> whereof being pos∣sessed, he endeavours to keep it with all his Force. The <HI>World</HI>; what is the <HI>designe</HI> of the men of the world, but, as <HI>Satans Souldiers,</HI> either by <HI>force</HI> or <HI>fraud</HI> to get the <HI>Con∣quest</HI> of this, either to draw the heart away from <HI>God</HI> by

Temptations, or fright it from <HI>Godliness</HI> by <HI>Persecution?</HI> and what use doth Satan make of the things of the <HI>world,</HI> but to make <HI>Traps</HI> and <HI>Snares,</HI> and <HI>baits</HI> to enveagle Souls, and allure them after him, that he may make a <HI>Seizure</HI> on them? the world it is the great <HI>Engine</HI> of <HI>Battery,</HI> which is used in the <HI>Siege</HI> which Satan layes to the <HI>Soul.</HI> And Lust within; what doth this lurke in the Soul for, but as a <HI>Spy</HI> watching its Season and Advantage to betray it? what else is its business, but to do all it can, to make the heart a <HI>Semina∣ry</HI> of sinful thoughts, to entertain all manner of wickedness? to keep Intelligence upon all the inward motions and stirr∣ings, and seek opportunity to Communicate it to <HI>Satan?</HI> lying in wait to kill every <HI>good thought</HI> in its Birth, nay, to <HI>stifle</HI> it in its <HI>Conception?</HI> to make a party strong within, that in a <HI>stress</HI> and <HI>shock</HI> of <HI>Temptation,</HI> may vote a <HI>Resig∣nation,</HI> and <HI>forcibly</HI> open the door thereunto? to be alwayes plotting and practising secret <HI>Treason</HI> against the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI>? thus are all our <HI>Enemies</HI> combined to drive this one designe to destroy our Souls.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reason</HI></NOTE>4 From <HI>the danger the Heart is Exposed unto,</HI> if it be not Carefully and Resolutely kept: it is alwayes in danger of being <HI>led out of the way,</HI> by these cunning <HI>Cheaters,</HI> drawn into <HI>sna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> with <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>Insinuating</HI> Speeches, trained into <HI>Ambushments,</HI> and so be <HI>surprized</HI> by its <HI>Enemies</HI>; It dwels among <HI>Murderers,</HI> such as are very <HI>sly</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> to do <HI>mis∣chief</HI>; it is <HI>Environed</HI> on all sides without, and within are <HI>Enemies,</HI> and if it Catch a wound, how dangerous must that wound needs be? wounds in the <HI>Heart are mortal,</HI> a prick with a pin brings Death there, which a deep gash in a <HI>Limbe</HI> will not do: nothing but the <HI>Balme of Christs Blood</HI> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the wounds of the Soul. Put these things together, and they will spell to us the Truth of this <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>Use I. Of <HI>Information.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the Life of a Christian here is a stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Militan∣cy</HI>; every man indeed is a <HI>Souldier,</HI> either under <HI>Christ</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI>; Engaged in a <HI>Warr,</HI> which will Issue either in his <HI>Happiness</HI> or <HI>Ruine</HI>: the Christian especially is called
<PB N="7" REF="000227_0008_0FA36B6A46CA5B88"/>
into a field of <HI>warr,</HI> where he must <HI>grapple</HI> with Enemies <HI>Fierce</HI> &amp; <HI>Cruel</HI>; fight for his life, or else lose it; sadly therefore are they mistaken, who hope to Arrive at a <HI>Crown of glory</HI> before they have first <HI>engaged</HI> themselves in a <HI>warfare, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c iter Elysium.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence <HI>the Life of a Christian is a Laborious Life.</HI> A Souldiers Employment, if duly followed, is no matter of Ease or Pleasure, but he must learn to make a <HI>Recreation</HI> of that which another would account a <HI>Death</HI>; to satisfie himself with <HI>hunger,</HI> and <HI>Thirst,</HI> and <HI>Cold,</HI> and <HI>Travailing,</HI> and <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Battails</HI>: how much more the Christian, who hath,</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Watchful Enemy,</HI> &amp; therefore he must not <HI>sleep</HI>: he hath an Enemy who is alwayes lying in wait to find him at a dis∣advantage, and having so found him, he will be sure to fall on, and at such a time we may be sure it is no little <HI>mischief</HI> that he then doth.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>busie Enemy,</HI> that loves not to ly still, and therefore he must not expect long to be out of <HI>Actual Service</HI>; let matters go either way, Satan still pursues his designe, <HI>Mar∣cellus</HI>-like, of whom <HI>Hannibal</HI> said, that he could never be quiet, <HI>nec Victor, nec Victus</HI>; beating, or beaten, all was one.</P>
<P N="3">3. An <HI>Vnwearied Enemy,</HI> and hence the Christians Ex∣ercises must be <HI>Constant,</HI> whom alwayes fresh Forces of new and Vigorous Temptations are sent up against.</P>
<P N="3">3. See here the <HI>Reason why so many Professors fall into Snares,</HI> are <HI>Caught</HI> in <HI>Ambusher,</HI> &amp; get so many <HI>wounds</HI>; It a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iseth through the great neglect that there is in the world of the practice of this duty: It is the Judgement of some, that it is nothing to be a good Souldier, needless to have, and if needful, easie to attain to Skill: many more there be, who think it nothing to learn the <HI>Rules</HI> of a <HI>Christian L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ &amp; indeed a thing needless to acquaint themselves with the wayes of God, and how to keep themselves out of the Enemies hand, neither do they regard how many <HI>wounds</HI> they receive, or what harm the Enemy doth them; having (as they pretend) that <HI>Panpharmacon,</HI> the <HI>Blood of Christ</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal</HI> all: Let this therefore reprove that great neglect which is found among the Army of Professors, of this so Important

a Duty: Oh! what little looking to, and careful keeping of our Hearts? the most of men think it enough to look to their outward Conversation: how few attend this Duty in its <HI>Extensiveness,</HI> to use all Endeavours about it? in its <HI>In∣tensiveness,</HI> to improve all diligence? in its Eminency, to keep their heart above all keepings? there is a great deal of Care now used, in these Times of danger and Warr, to keep our bodily Lives from the Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Enemy, to save our goods, we look after our <HI>Flocks,</HI> and our <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds,</HI> and we can give very good Reason for that; but are not hearts mean while neglected? where almost is the man that useth <HI>dili∣gence, Care</HI> and <HI>endeavour</HI> about this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how loose and Remiss, how Careless and Secure are we? how open do we lay our Hearts to Satans Assaults? how little fortifying is there a∣gainst the Enemy, and standing upon our Gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>? this is a matter to be lamented; hence it comes to pass that Religion lies a bleeding, and many strong men fall before the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fraud</HI> of their Enemies: this deserves a Reproof; Is not the Heart undervalued? men use to be most Careful of that which they most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize, especially in Times of danger; and shall that which is most <HI>worth,</HI> have least <HI>esteem</HI>? o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do we know our Enemies? is either the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <HI>Froud,</HI> or En∣mity of Satan discovered? neither do we set a due Esteem on the Glory of God, shall we <HI>sin that grace may abound, God Forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> Nay, it Argues, that men are not acquainted with their own Hearts, <HI>Jehu</HI> like, they presume their hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts are right, know not, and therefore fear not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Trai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors that are secretly lodged within; and certainly the things of the world have too high a price set upon them, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n have not a true <HI>Judgement</HI> nor <HI>Valuation</HI> of things: well, these things will bring sore <HI>Losses,</HI> and at the last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in sad <HI>Lamenta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on</HI> and <HI>Mourning.</HI></P>

keep it for him; there are many that seek to Rob him of his Right, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore the more diligence and Industry ought we to use; sad is their Condition who have <HI>Alienated</HI> Gods Right, and betrayed to <HI>Satan, World,</HI> and their <HI>own Lusts,</HI> the <HI>Hold,</HI> and <HI>Possession</HI> of their <HI>Hearts</HI>: let such mourn for their <HI>Apostacy,</HI> and <HI>lament</HI> for their <HI>Infidelity,</HI> and <HI>sigh</HI> to <HI>Heaven</HI> for <HI>Deliverance, imploring</HI> the help of God for their <HI>Recovery</HI>; get your Hearts into <HI>Subjection</HI> unto God, and then <HI>keep them</HI> for him: let him have the <HI>Lordship</HI> and <HI>Do∣minion</HI> over them; suffer no <HI>Vsurper</HI> to assume his <HI>Throne.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Motive.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Consider, the Equity of your Cause</HI>; no Change of Suc∣cess can groundedly put it into question, it is a <HI>defensive Warre,</HI> your Souls are <HI>Hostilely</HI> Invaded, the whole <HI>Country</HI> of your <HI>Heart</HI> is filled with <HI>Enemies</HI>; there may be many <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce Scruples</HI> against a <HI>Forreign Invation</HI>; and I do believe that the People of God oftentimes <HI>engage</HI> in needless <HI>Quar∣rels,</HI> and if they are beaten soundly they may thank them∣selves: thus <HI>Josiah</HI> goes <HI>uncalled</HI> against <HI>Necho,</HI> to meet a Death he might have avoided had he kept his place; but <HI>self Preservation</HI> is a Rule written in the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> practiced by all <HI>Ranks</HI> of <HI>Beings,</HI> and legible enough in the Hearts of <HI>fallen men</HI>: your Cause is <HI>just,</HI> it is in <HI>Gods Right,</HI> which is undeniable; it is for your own <HI>Preservation from Eternal Ruine,</HI> which is <HI>Indubitable</HI>; it is against usurping Enemies who cannot make good the least true Title against Cruel Enemies; whose <HI>tender mercies are cruelty,</HI> and it is better dying in a <HI>good Cause</HI> then Conquering in a bad one:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Consider, the weight and greatness of the Cause</HI> you are engaged in: Remember you carry your <HI>Life, Honour, Glo∣ry, Liberty</HI> in your right hand, which must either manfully be defended, or basely lost: they are poor and trifling things which the men of the world scufle and fight for, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compa∣red with the Exigencies of this <HI>Warfare</HI>: In particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, <HI>the worth of that you fight for,</HI> and what you must lose, if you lose the day: it is to keep your <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts,</HI> your Souls from the <HI>Destroyer</HI>; you may a little Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the
<PB N="10" REF="000227_0011_0FA36B6ED90DE120"/>
worth of them if you Consider, either the value which the whole <HI>Trinity</HI> sets upon them, <HI>God the Father</HI> in those <HI>choice Decrees</HI> of Election and Reprobation, when he intended the highest manifestation of the glory of his Name in such as should be Eternal monuments of it, he chose Souls to be the Subjects thereof: and <HI>God the Son</HI> in the great price of <HI>Redemption</HI> which he paid for Souls, to buy them out of the hands of <HI>Divine Revenging Justice,</HI> and purchase them for himself, that he might have Everlasting Society with them, to which End he counted not his precious Life too dear to Sacrifice to the displeasure of a <HI>justly provoked God</HI>: or <HI>God the Holy Ghost,</HI> in the Labour and Care which he layes out about them, in striving and Endeavouring with them in <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> and <HI>Providences</HI> with great patience for the pro∣moving of their Eternal good: or the <HI>holy Angels,</HI> in that Cheerful Ministration of theirs to, and for the good of Souls: or <HI>Devils</HI> in their <HI>Constant</HI> and <HI>Indefatigable pains</HI> which they take for to gain Souls to themselves, <HI>1 Pet. 5.8.</HI> Or, Consider the Soul in its Capacities, it was made after the <HI>Image</HI> of God, <HI>Aurae Divinae particula,</HI> endued with an <HI>Vnderstanding</HI> capable of the most <HI>Sovereign Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> fitted for a Closure with the chief good, <HI>Capacitated</HI> for the Everlasting Fruition of God in Glory: is there any Excellency in man above other Creatures, it is by this? Is there any worth in the body, it is made so by this? and when it leavs it, it is an <HI>useless Carkass.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Consider, <HI>what great difficulty is in keeping the Heart,</HI> think therefore how many Enemies it hath that are practi∣sing against it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Rebellious Flesh,</HI> which bears an Enmity against the Spiritual good of the Soul, <HI>Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.7.</HI> there is a world of this <HI>Rebellion</HI> in the best of us, which is both <HI>Irreconcile∣ably Opposite</HI> against God, not to be perswaded by <HI>Promi∣ses,</HI> nor Terrified by <HI>Threatnings, Rom 7 5.</HI> and exceeding <HI>subtle to deceive,</HI> full of <HI>Carnal Reasonings,</HI> and <HI>Politick Ar∣guings</HI>: and also <HI>Resolute</HI> and <HI>Violent</HI> in its way, heady in the Prosecution of its designes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>glect the Careful Inspecti∣on
<PB N="11" REF="000227_0012_0FA36B6FB2901780"/>
over it, but for a moment, and it breaks Prison, and it playes <HI>Rex.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Power and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icy of Satan,</HI> called <HI>Powers of Dark∣ness,</HI> from their great Force; Spirits from their Nature, and Spiritual Approaches which they make, <HI>wily Adversaries,</HI> because of their <HI>sly</HI> and <HI>subtle Stratagem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Foulers,</HI> having from the beginning employed their Devilish wit to lay <HI>Ambushes</HI> in secret places to Ensnare Souls; adde to this their <HI>Sollicitous Endeavours</HI> without discouragement, their <HI>Constant Sedulity</HI> without weariness in the pursuit of their designes; these things render <HI>Satan</HI> Formidable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What great matter of Temptation there is in the world</HI>; from the men of the world, partly by <HI>feigned Friendship</HI> to draw away the Heart from God, and partly by <HI>professed En∣mity,</HI> and practiced <HI>Cruelty</HI> to fright it from his Service: and from the things of the world, which are in their Nature so fitted and Accommodated to seduce and allure, to draw away the Heart after them, and hold it in <HI>Compliance,</HI> and so to lead the Creature into the Snares of the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, <HI>what depends upon this Duty attended or neg∣lected</HI>: keep thy <HI>Soul,</HI> and keep thy <HI>Life</HI>: though God saves none <HI>for doing,</HI> yet he doth it in <HI>a way of doing</HI>: If we keep not our selves, God will not keep us, but in this way are we led to Eternal Life: to neglect our <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Watch,</HI> and <HI>guard,</HI> hazard our Everlasting Ruine: God requires this of us as a Duty, to neglect it is to break the Laws of <HI>Gods Camp</HI>: if the Heart be not kept, it will be lost, and it will be an <HI>unspeakable Loss,</HI> so much as the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul is worth, such is the Loss: Consider what is lost when the Soul is lost, God <HI>is lost, Christ is lost, Heaven is lost,</HI> a <HI>Kingdome</HI> of glo∣ry is lost: and if all this be lost for want of looking after, thou wilt when it is too late Cry out of thy <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>mad∣ness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, <HI>what Encouragement thou hast to put for∣ward in this Service</HI>; For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God himself looks or,</HI> he observes all thy Labour and Fi∣delity, and he will own all that thou dost for him, thy sin∣cere,
<PB N="12" REF="000227_0013_0FA36B7050731328"/>
though weak Endeavours shall be accepted, yea, and Crowned too, and he so stands by thee, as one that ready is to lend thee an helping hand when thou art in a Strait, and be thy strength against Enemies that are more and mighty then thou art; be but true to him, and thou shalt never want As∣sistance from him, nor be discountenanced in what thou dost for him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Thou marchest under a brave Commander, Jesus Christ the Captain of our Salvation,</HI> valiant, prudent, successful; who never turned his back, when he was Confronted with the Powers of Earth and Hell, and set upon by the wrath of an angry God; upon whom his most watchful Foes could never take the least Advantage, who never marched into the Field, but came out again a <HI>through Conquerour</HI>; who hath <HI>led Captivity Captive,</HI> overcome the <HI>World,</HI> triumphed over <HI>Devils</HI>; he will both lead us up, and bring us off, what Coward would not be valiant under such a <HI>Leader.</HI></P>
<Q>Nil desperandum Christo Duce.</Q>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thou shalt have both Success and Wages,</HI> do but resist, by the grace and strength of God, and thy Enemies shall fly before thee; hold out with a holy Resolution in the Cause of God, and thou shalt receive <HI>a Crown of glory, Im∣mortality,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life</HI>: in this Engagement none ever were slain <HI>fighting</HI>; all the harm comes by <HI>flying</HI>: none ever that engaged in this Cause had any Reason to complain that they served an <HI>hard Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now would you manage this business to Advantage, and defend this Fortress, so as that it may be kept for God, and in his obedience, labour to be, and shew your selves good Souldiers of Christ.</P>
<P>I must needs acknowledge it farr better for me to occupy a lower place in this body, or part of the Army of the <HI>Church Militant,</HI> as being fitter to receive then to give Instruction; but, it being the Lot and Custome of these dayes to call forth, not alwayes the most Skilful, to Ezercise others, and therein

to quicken up themselves, &amp; to put forward in <HI>Military Skill.</HI> I submit to, and owne the Providence of God, and crave of him, who <HI>teacheth the Hands to warr and the Fingers to fight,</HI> to direct these following Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Get the Heart and Spirit of a Souldier</HI>: there are some Virtues belonging to this Vocation, without which kept in Exercise a man can never be Renowned: These are—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Prudence</HI> for the managing of affairs; without this, great strength attended with never so much of Resolution, is but like <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iphemus</HI> without an Eye: It was the Com∣mendation of <HI>Alexanders</HI> Army, though but small for so great an undertaking as the <HI>Asian Conquest</HI> was, yet he scarcely had a Common Souldier, but was fit to lead a <HI>Squa∣dron,</HI> nor a Captain of a <HI>Phalanx,</HI> but knew how to ma∣nage an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my: and to this prudence is r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quisite, Skill to Consider, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Compare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Cases, and suitably to apply them; and hence, both an <HI>Acquaintance</HI>▪ with the <HI>History</HI> of for∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes, and Ability to Judge between Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ional, and ei∣ther meerly Casual, or Supernatural Events. It is not enough to know what hath been done, but why, else we may follow <HI>Presidents</HI> to our harm; thus <HI>Vano,</HI> in that Fa∣tal Battel of <HI>Cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> takes Example from former Leaders, and draws up his Army, narrow in <HI>Front,</HI> deep in <HI>Fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke,</HI> forgetting that that had been done against the <HI>Elephants,</HI> whereas there were at that time none, and so exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed him∣self to be gau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by the horse, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which the Enemy had great plenty, which lost him the day. The Enemies of our Souls are wily, they come not up alwayes in one <HI>way or method,</HI> but have many <HI>Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agems,</HI> and subtle devices, and we must nei∣ther be ignorant of them, nor yet of the way how to Cir∣cumvent and avoid them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Prowes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Fortitude</HI>: Courage is the Life of a Soul∣dier; <HI>Cowardice</HI> is the most <HI>disgra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ful Epithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> that can be put up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him, hence that, <HI>Eph. 6.10· be strong or Couragiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: the proper work or Service belonging to Warr requires this Spirit of Valour; he that is called to look danger in the Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to expose himself to <HI>push of Pike, dint of Sword,</HI> to meet with
<PB N="14" REF="000227_0015_0FA36B72124C6AF0"/>
<HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Fury,</HI> to see men falling on the right and left hand, to pass through Fields scattered with dead bodies, and <HI>gar∣ments rolled in Blood,</HI> had not he need to have some Spirits in him? this is a Christians Constant Employment; his Enemies are potent and furious, his hazards eminent, his Battels frequent, and many of his Fellow Christians, some bleeding of deep and dangerous wounds which they have gotten, and others Cowardly running away from their Co∣lours, and betraying of their Cause: oftentimes is he left, with <HI>Paul,</HI> alone, and no man to stand by him, or second him when beset with Enemies; he had need then to streng∣then his Resolution.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hardiness</HI>: hence is that Counsel given to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.3. <HI>as a good Souldier of Christ endure hardness</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Souldier must expect to be acpuainted with hardships, and should therefore harden himself for them: <HI>tedious marches, hard lodging, Course Fare,</HI> to be pinched back and belly, ex∣posed to Storms and Tempests, stand out upon watchings, be ready to run up upon every Assault, and not be afraid of <HI>blows</HI>▪ nor faint under <HI>wounds,</HI> these are the Lessons of the <HI>School of Warr</HI>; hence men delicately brought up are no waies fit for <HI>Field Service</HI>: great and sore are the difficulties that attend a Christian in his Course and Pilgrimage here, every step of his way is Encountred with fresh Trials, he goes not to Heaven in a <HI>Feather Bed</HI> of Ease and delicacy, but it is through much <HI>Tribulation</HI> that he enters into <HI>glory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fear</HI>: the Scripture saith, <HI>blessed is the man that fear∣eth alwayes</HI>; there is a fear not unbecomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g a Souldier, nor a disgrace to his Courage, a fear of exposing himself to unnecessary dangers, undertaking needless Tasks, running up∣on unneedful hazards, pulling upon himself disadvantages, a <HI>Fear of Caution</HI> not to make Imprudent Attempts, nor such Charges as savour more of vain glory then wisdome, and bring a man Credit but by Accident: it is an easy mat∣ter to <HI>lead men up</HI> against an Enemy, and <HI>Engage</HI> them in a <HI>Fight,</HI> but to <HI>bring them off</HI> again with honour and Safety, <HI>his Labor, hoc opus est</HI>; It was a Counsel given by a Fool,
<PB N="15" REF="000227_0016_0FA36B7288E5AA08"/>
but well becoming a wiseman, when the <HI>King of Spain</HI> con∣sulted his <HI>Nobles</HI> how to get an Army over the <HI>Alpes</HI>; nay rather, said he, Consider how to get them back again? Satan hath as well his <HI>Ambushes</HI> to <HI>Catch the heady,</HI> as his <HI>Troops</HI> to pursue and overtake the <HI>Cowardly Christian: Fabious Maximus</HI> did more against <HI>Vafrous Hannibal cun∣ctando,</HI> by prudent and Considerate delayes, then <HI>Servilius Marcellus,</HI> and many other <HI>Hot-Spurs</HI> by furious Assaults, whom he never failed to draw into <HI>Sna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI>; and it is valour enough, in many Cases, not to be afraid to stand upon our <HI>Guard,</HI> and keep our ground, till further and better Oppor∣tunity.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Sobriety</HI>: he that <HI>striveth for the mastery</HI> is temperate in all things, <HI>1 Cor. 9.25.</HI> observable is that of the <HI>Poet</HI>:
<Q>Invadunt urbem summo vinoq sepultam:</Q>
the world is full of sad Examples upon this Account: when was <HI>Babilon</HI> taken, but when <HI>Belshazzar</HI> had been solemni∣zing his Birth day with his Court, (and doubtless his Soul∣diers rock pattern from him) in his <HI>drunken Festival</HI>: yea, the vanities of the world are the very weapons which Satan useth to wound the people of God withal, who, through <HI>Intemperance</HI> and <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in lawful things, betray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the Cause of God: <HI>in licitis perimus omnes</HI>: how many are there who having <HI>begun in the Spirit, have ended in the Flesh,</HI> being bribed and Corrupted by the <HI>pleasures, profits,</HI> and <HI>honours</HI> of a vain world: sober Christians are most like to be true and valiant: then was <HI>Rome</HI> in a rising posture, when the <HI>Scep∣ter</HI> and the <HI>Ploughshare</HI> could <HI>Interchangeably</HI> take their turns, as occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equired: he that can be content with a <HI>dinner of Herbs,</HI> will not be tempted with <HI>Pyrthu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s gold,</HI> said, <HI>Fabritius</HI> to the <HI>Embassadour,</HI> seeking to draw him away, to betray his Country to the Enemies of it: could we but seek and use the world and things of it with a Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rency, we were then fit for <HI>Christs Camp,</HI> as long as Satan can Catch us with these things, we shall make poor work of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Fidelity</HI>: this, though it be last named, is not the
<PB N="16" REF="000227_0017_0FA36B7347170488"/>
least Vertue of a Souldier: he that will not be true to his Trust, is not fit to be trusted: <HI>Treachery</HI> is a thing so ha∣ted among men, the worst of men, that they who, for the turne to their own Advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, love the <HI>Treason,</HI> yet never can endure the <HI>Traitour,</HI> and hence they speedily take him out of the way, and that is most frequently his Reward: God requires Truth in the inward part, that the <HI>Soul</HI> be <HI>for him,</HI> and <HI>stedfast in his Covenant,</HI> and hold on without war∣ping: <HI>Satan</HI> will present and proffer many <HI>Bribes,</HI> tender and promise <HI>great things</HI>; worldly Accomodations, Ease, plea∣sure, honour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the Christian hath <HI>sworn</HI> to God, and must <HI>perform,</HI> and if he be faithful unto the Death, if he hold out against all alluring Temptations, he shall have a Crowne; but if he look back, he shall be judged as a <HI>Trai∣tour,</HI> unworthy of Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Provide your selves with Armour of Proof,</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> to use it: The Scripture directs us to a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and gives us full and plain Rules for improvement. A good Souldier, if unarmed, is not fit for Service, some pieces may seem troublesome to carry, but they will be missed in the Fight if left behind: well may he expect to be shot through that wants his <HI>Shield</HI>; how shall the head be defended with∣out the <HI>Helmet</HI>? what hurt can he do his Enemy, that is without his <HI>Sword</HI>? and be sure it be the <HI>Armour of God,</HI> no other will save us, or harm our Enemy a Soul void of <HI>true grace</HI> is easily carried by every Assault that is made upon it▪ get a <HI>Shield of Faith,</HI> a <HI>Helmet of Salvation,</HI> a <HI>girdle of Truth,</HI> a <HI>Breastplate of Righteousness,</HI> the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. and learn how to use your Arms; handling of Arms indeed begins to be accounted but a meer Flourish, and unnecessa∣ry point of Discipline, and thereupon it begins to be laid aside as useless: but I assure you, the <HI>Christian</HI> hath to do with <HI>Enemies</HI> Skilful to do harm, and if he himself be a <HI>bun∣gler,</HI> he shall get many a <HI>scratch,</HI> yea, and <HI>deep wounds</HI> too, yea, and it may be harm himself with his own weapon: <HI>God is a man of Warr,</HI> he is the <HI>Teacher of Israel,</HI> go to him for Instruction: <HI>pray</HI> much, and <HI>practice</HI> much, so shall the

graces of the Spirit be in use, and you shall rhrough <HI>Divine Assistance</HI> be able to repel your Soul Enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Make it your Calling and Employment to guard your Hearts,</HI> defend your Souls, keep off your Enemies, and use all Courses to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t End appointed in the Word of God, and which have by the people of God been found to be Ad∣vantagious in this designe: here observe, the Warr is pro∣perly <HI>Defensive,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is to be kept, you are <HI>garrison Souldiers</HI>: therefore.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fortifie thy Heart with all Care</HI>: he that knows his own <HI>weaknes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and his Enemies both <HI>strength</HI> and <HI>Polic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> never thinks he hath done enough, <HI>Phil. 3.11, 12.</HI> present grace will not do; some are ready to say that Forts are only occasions to take off the Edge of true Valour, but our sad Experience hath taught us that the want, or weakness of them hath cost many a Life: he that hath done most this way to his heart, shall find work enough to defend it, and trial sufficient of his Courage, it may be we have some time found our selves in the <HI>Assaults of Temptation</HI> to come off with <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>sorrow,</HI> through neglect of seasonable streng∣thening our hearts against them: this should excite us to the work especially, Considering we know not how soon we may be called to <HI>run with Horsemen. I</HI> know the <HI>stur∣dy Spartans</HI> lived long without Walls, and prospered; but <HI>Christians,</HI> like the <HI>Conies,</HI> are a <HI>feeble Folk,</HI> and it is there∣fore their wisdome to take the Advantage of the <HI>Rock.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Prudently cut off all supplies from your Enemies,</HI> it is an <HI>Impolitick Course</HI> to leave an Enemy that makes an Invasion, any thing behind to live upon: <HI>make no Provision for the Flesh,</HI> is the <HI>Apostles Counsel; i. e.</HI> Cut off all Provision when it comes to Assault you let it find none, hence, <HI>morti∣fie Carnal desires,</HI> call in <HI>wandring Affections,</HI> get your <HI>Hearts</HI> off from the things of the world, is there any thing in thy heart, that cannot be useful and serviceable for Christ, set fire to it, least the Enemy reap Advantage by it.</P>

Temptations oftentimes make a way into the Soul: observe therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where they are made, and how: take this here as a Rule, if you would not be mistaken here, that a breach is not only then made, when thy heart is drawn in to give its <HI>Consent</HI> to the <HI>Commission of sin,</HI> but when the <HI>strength</HI> of thy <HI>Resolution</HI> against it is <HI>weakned</HI>; here the Enemy will soon clap his <HI>Ladders</HI>: if God help thee to oppose <HI>Temptation</HI> with a full <HI>Resolution</HI> of <HI>grace,</HI> the <HI>Bullets</HI> then are <HI>dampt</HI>; but if thou do but so much as <HI>deliberate</HI> the Wall is <HI>shaken</HI>: having therefore found it, stop it presently, call off <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>Impertinent Thoughts,</HI> and not only so, but, in a way of <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> renew thy <HI>Vows, Prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses</HI> and <HI>Resolutions,</HI> little Breaches will soon grow great ones, if not speed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y made up.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Look well to the Watch</HI>: our Saviour Christ gives strict Command again and again, upon this Account; to sleep on the watch in time of a Siege is a <HI>Capital Crime.</HI> It was a tart, but a just <HI>Sarcasme</HI> of that <HI>Captain,</HI> who in walking the Rounds found one that should have been watching, <HI>asleep,</HI> drew his Sword, and ran him through, saying, <HI>dead I found thee, dead I leave thee</HI>: how many Examples of sad Consequence hath the world Experienced upon this Ac∣count: look to all within: knowest thou not that thou hast a Soul <HI>Enemy</HI> lurking in thy bosome, that will readily upon Advantage open the gates to Satan and the World? keep a holy Jealousie upon thy <HI>Faculties,</HI> disarm thy <HI>Affections,</HI> and do severe Execution upon any <HI>Lusts</HI> that are found <HI>rang∣ing</HI>: keep an Eye upon Satan; walke the Rounds of thy Soul continually; look to the <HI>Cinque Ports,</HI> set a strong Guard upon every Sense, and know who stands at the <HI>Eye, Ear,</HI> &amp;c. beware what motion thou openest the door to; it is easy for an Enemy to put on the <HI>habit of a Friend</HI>; stop every <HI>Suggestion</HI> without, and well examine it: every thing that <HI>complains against sin</HI> is not <HI>grace</HI>: you know the Story of <HI>Zopirus,</HI> when his Master could not take <HI>Babilon</HI> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce, he mangles and cuts himself, and so falls off, com∣plaining of his <HI>Lords Cruelty,</HI> which won him so much Cre∣dit as lost the City.

<P N="5">5, <HI>Put forward in ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Assault,</HI> and <HI>fight Couragiously</HI>: when thou art Assaulted by Temptation, <HI>fly</HI> not before it, much less <HI>lay down Arms,</HI> and cry <HI>Quarter,</HI> here is no mer∣cy to be expected, our spiritual Enemies are <HI>Vnreconc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le∣able,</HI> think this, If I <HI>yield</HI> I <HI>dye,</HI> if I <HI>resist</HI> I can but <HI>dye,</HI> think of thy <HI>Oath</HI> given to God, remember none ever were over∣come but by yield<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng; and count it a quarrel worth the ven∣turing thy Life in.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Finding thy own strength to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il,</HI> which thou wilt do, <HI>call in help</HI>: much debate is in the world about using <HI>Aux∣iliary Aid.</HI> I sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l not now m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddle with the Question: though I know <HI>Abraham</HI> made use of help, and that of <HI>Hea∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> too; this I am sure of, the present Case is out of dis∣pute, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther admits of those Obiection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are made against humane Aid, <HI>Christ</HI> is both <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing,</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> too: keep therefore before thee a Constant Ap∣prehension of thy own <HI>Insufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> let that direct thee to him. <HI>When I am weak, I am strong,</HI> a Christian is never in more danger then when Carnally Confident: this wound∣ed <HI>Peter,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Saint</HI> besides; Consider thine Ene∣mies, remember what poor things have tempted thee▪ hence, when Temptation comes, first, with <HI>Jacob, wrestle</HI> with <HI>God,</HI> and then wrestle with the <HI>Temptation</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> 1 John 5.4. <HI>keep an Eye to Heaven,</HI> resolve by the grace of God, never to yield, do all thou hast to do <HI>through him strengthening thee.</HI></P>

on such Advantages: <HI>Satan</HI> sometimes Retreats, and seems to fly, like <HI>Hannibal,</HI> on purpose to draw us into <HI>an Am∣bush</HI>: but if God Assisting, he be <HI>worsted,</HI> yet will he <HI>Rally again,</HI> thou art in a Country that will never be Clear of Ene∣mies, yea, Enemies whose <HI>Scouts</HI> are alwayes out, and keep∣ing <HI>Espial</HI> upon thee; thank God for every <HI>Battel gained,</HI> but remember still, thou art in <HI>the Field</HI> upon thy <HI>high pla∣ces,</HI> and must therefore <HI>sing,</HI> not with thy <HI>Harpe,</HI> but <HI>Arms</HI> in thy <HI>hand,</HI> when was <HI>David</HI> surprized worst, but when he thought himself clear of danger.</P>
