<P N="1">1. As for the predictions of friends, you have had many, both ordinary and extraordinary.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Ordinary,</HI> upon the observations which the Messengers of God have made of year barrenness, wantonness, and unchristian divisions, under the fullest Gospel-light and liberty, that ever was enjoyed by an unthankful Nation, amongst which I cannot omit what a grave and worthy Divine upon the ground fore-mentioned, for divers years past, gave us warning of: And O that we had been so wise and happy to have improved such a seasonable admonition! his words are these▪</P>

The unseasonableness of the strife betwixt <HI>Abrahams</HI> hardsmen and <HI>Lots,</HI> is aggrevated by the near neighbourhood of the Heathens to them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13.7. <HI>And there was strife betwixt them, and the Cananites and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dwelt in their land.</HI> To fall out when these Idolaters look on, this would be Town talk presently, and put themselves and their Religion both to shame.

O Christians! shall <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pilate</HI> put you to shame? they clapt up a peice to strengthen their hands against Christ; and will not you unite against your common enemy? 'tis an ill time for Marriners to be fighting, when an enemy is boring a hole at the bottom of the Ship.</Q></P>
<P>How often have you been told both from the Pulpet and Press, what the sad fruit and issue of these things would be? and as God hath given you timely warnings of this enemy by your faithful Watchmen in an ordinary way, so that he vouchsafed us some ex∣traordinary ones too, amongst which I cannot here omit a strange and remarkable passage, which for divers years since, fell from the pen of an English Prophet; and because I live to see one part there∣of sadly verified, and the other disposing it self towards it's accom∣plishment (if providence step not out of it's ordinary path to pre∣vent it. I shall transcribe some of the most remarkable and bearing passages of it for you, my Author having reproved the wantonness and vanity of Professors, particularly those of <HI>London,</HI> breaks forth into this threatning and terrible prediction.</P>

to be new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> either run or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it. Your looking-glass will be snatcht away, your bright Diamond shiver'd in pieces; this goodly City of yours all in sheards; ye may seek for a threshold of your ancient dwellings, for a pillar of your pleasant habitations, and not finde them; nothing left but naked streets or naked fields of shelter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this is but the misery of Stone-work, of arches, dormans, and roofs; but what will you say when it comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> skin work, arms, necks and bowels? Ye which have walked the streets in state, may then run the streets in destractions, with one leg, or half an arm, they may beg the preservation of the rest of your members: What inventions will ye then be put to, to save your lives? Your tears will not rescue, nor your gold redeem you, but your veins must weep, as well as your eyes; and your sides be wa∣tered, as well as your cheeks; when they allow you no showres of rain, but showres of blood to wash your streets, when you shall see no men in your Corporation, but the mangled Citizen; and hear no noise in the street, but the cryes and shreeks, yells and pants, of gasping, dying men: when ye shall see your Kindred slain in one place, your Wives in another, your Children in a third, and your selves at last (it may be) cut in two, to encrease the number of the dead carcasses.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As popolus as ye are, ye shall then be numbred to the Sword; as puissant as ye are, the valiant shall be swept away, as fine fed as ye are, ye shall be fed with your own flesh, and made drunk with your own blood; your polititians can no longer help you, but have their subtile brains dasht in pieces with yours; nor your Le∣cturers can no longer save you, but you must meet together at the Congregation near the <HI>Shambles,</HI> when this great City shall be but a great Chopping board, to quarter out the limbs of sinners, or the great Altar wherein a whole City is to be Sacrificed Oh dole∣ful day! when your breasts shall try the points of Spears, your sides the keeness of the Swords, your hands the weight of Pole-axes, your bodies made footstools, and your dead Carcasses stepping-stones for truculent foes, to tread and trample on; when there will be no pity upon the aged, nor compassion upon the young: but heaps upon heaps: tumbling of garments in blood, and Sword made fat with slaughter. Oh! see what a Crimson City, Crim∣son sins will make!</Q></P>
<P><Q>If you do escape the dint of the Sword, and your lives be give you for a prey; Shall not your goods be made a prey? yes, some may be reserved out of the greatest Massacre; when men ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

weary with killing a retreat may be sounded, and called off from the slaughter? yet can ye then challenge your own houses, or bring your Keyes to your old Chests? No, your titles gone, your interest lost, ye have traded your selves out of your Estates, or sinned your selves out of your proprieties: The Enemy is now house-keeper, Land-holder; ye have forfeited all to the Sword; farewel Inheri∣tances, Purchases, Leases, Wares, Wardrobe, Furniture, Jewels. As you have gotten these goods unjustly, so they shall be taken away unjustly; and if they be not slain in the heap▪ yet they do but live to see their own misery, their sins have made them Bankrupts, they are undone; ruin'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And Oh! if the loss of Money were the greatest mischief, but there is a treasure of greater value in danger; there is not an abso∣lute conquest made, till the inner man be in fetters; thou must be a slave in principles: Oh! it is an hard thing at that time to be a <HI>Jew</HI> inwardly to keep the girdle of truth about thy loins; thou must then bare the fruit of the degenerate plant, or strange vine: pour out the drink-offerings of other Sacrifices, follow the sorcery of the Mistriss of Witchcrafts, or learn Magick with them that are brought up in the Doctrine of Devils; thou must limp with the halting age: fit thy mouth to answer the general shout. That great is <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephesians:</HI> thou must taunt thy own Father, spit in the face of thine own Mother, and hiss away all thy true Brethren: thou must be divorced from thy own Faith, though never so chaste, and deny <HI>Sarah</HI> to be thy Wife, though thy Espousals with her were never so solemn. There will be no safety inconta∣minate faith: thou wilt be either a <HI>Nicodemus</HI> to come to Christ by night: or if with <HI>Daniel</HI> thou open the windows towards <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> thou wilt be cast into the Den of Lions.</Q>
Thus far he.</P>
<P>An inundation of <HI>Popery</HI> was also predicted by the learned Bishop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> immediately before his death, as is well known to many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Vsher.</HI></NOTE> And where is the heart that hath any spiritual sense or tenderness in it, that trembles not in a fearful expectation of these things? <HI>Surely,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secrets to his Servants the Prophets.</HI> This is one ground of fear.</P>
<P N="2">2. And your fears cannot chuse but encrease, when you consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he preparation and progress these enemies have already made, Have they been sleeping, think you all this while? no, no, they have dig∣ged as deep as hell in their Counsels, their numbers among us are already formidable, their combinations strong, their confidences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and their Forraign assistants ready.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 4.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>As the keepers of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

Isai. 9.11.</NOTE> Two considerable ad∣vantages they have already obtained: <HI>(first)</HI> the removal of so many able and godly Ministers out of the way. This is done to their hands by a sad providence: It is an old and true observation. That whosoever will attempt the overthrow of Religion, must be∣gin with the Ministry first. <HI>These are set for the defence of the Gospel.</HI> It was the counsel that <HI>Adam Contzen</HI> (a deep pated <HI>Achitophel</HI> of theirs) long since gave in this case; Suppress (saith he) the Mi∣nisters; <HI>(Et error cui patrocinium deerit, sine pugna concidet)</HI> and then the error, that hath none to patronize it, will fall of it self: So he calls the precious truth of Jesus Christ; I dare not affirm that this was intentionally done to open a door of opportunity to them, but that eventually it's like to prove so, who that exercises reason sees not? when so many pious Ministers went off the Stage, it was apparent enough what an opportunity these men had to as∣cend it, and act their part.</P>
<P>Secondly, The destruction of our famous City, the strength and glory of the Nation, which they have laid in the dust; a design no doubt, contrived in the Popish Conclave: they well enough knew how able London was to give check to their designes.</P>
<P>My heart bleedeth for thee <HI>London</HI> to see thee made <HI>of a City, an Heap, of a defenced City, a Ruine; a Pallace of strangers to be no City.</HI> And if they can have their will, that which follows in the text should be added; <HI>It shall never be built,</HI> If Parliaments will hearken to them, they will perswade like <HI>Rehum</HI> and <HI>Shimsai,</HI> Ezra 4.14▪ that it may lie still in it's Ashes, and upon the same preten∣tions, <HI>let search be made</HI> (say they) <HI>in the Book of Records of thy Fa∣thers, so shalt thou finde in the Book of Records, and know that this City is a rebellious City, and hurtful unto Kings &amp; Provinces, they that have moved sedition wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin the same of old time; for which cause it was de∣stroyed.</HI> But I trust the Lord will make our Rulers wife, to discover their bloody intentions; how speciously so ever p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliated with pre∣tences of Loyalty and Fidelity.</P>

<P>Let no man think that I endeavour to obscure the righteous Hand of God, which is to be own'd and trembled at in such a judg∣ment. Though <HI>London</HI> must acknowledge his Justice in all that is come upon her; yet the wickedness of Instruments is not in the least to be excused thereby: God and man may concurre in the same action, and yet neither his Holiness have any fellowship with their wickedness; nor their Injustice, be excused by his righteous∣ness; <HI>Idem quod duo faciunt non est idem, his work is perfect, for all his wayes are judgement; a God of truth, and without Iniquity; just and right is He, they have corrupted themselves,</HI> Deut. 32.4.5.

<P>But to return from this sad (though necessary) digression; here∣by it is manifest the common enemy hath obtained a singular, and long expected advantage to their design; often have they in vain at∣tempted it; but now God hath delivered it into their hands: Well might they rejoyce as they did) to see it'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flames ascend, and drink healths to it's ashes.

If it be again objected▪ this is but the groundless construction of a peevish adversary. To conclude the controversie: here what a Prelate of our own faith in the case, they are the words of the learned Primate of <HI>Ireland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Vsher</HI> of the Ce∣rem. pag. 209.</NOTE>
<Q>The Kings and Queens of <HI>England</HI> (saith he) imposed their Ceremonies, that there∣by they might decline the charge of Schismaticks, wherewith the the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> laboured to brand them, seeing it did appear hereby, they only left them in such Doctrinal points, wherein they left the truth. Again, hereby they would testifie, how far they would stoop to win and gain them, by yielding as far as they might in their own way: But (saith he) the experience of many years hath shew'd that this condescention hath rather hardened them in their errors, then brought them to a liking of our Religion; this being their usual saying, if our Flesh be not good, why do you drink of our broth?</Q></P>
<P>And have we not grounds for our fears, think you now, if we are blamed for our jealousies, we must blame them that give cause for them. Would B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shops cast out those Popish Ceremonies, our fears of Popery would be so much abated; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that nurse up these Romish brats we cannot but suspect to have too much love for that Harlot that begot them.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>Ah! how little do our bold informers think whose work they are doing! little do Constables think they are breaking down of the Wall and Gates of the Nation; when breaking up the peaceable Meetings of Gods People. Poor men! did you but see how the Papists laugh among themselves, to see their work so industriously performed by your hands, it would surely cool your courage, and check your irregular zeal: Alas! they are not so much afraid of your Swords, as of these mens prayers. That Popish <HI>Queen of Scot∣land</HI> spake out and professed she dreaded more the Prayers of Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> (a godly <HI>Nonconformist</HI>) then an Army of ten Thousand men. And will you so officiously serve them, by disarming so ma∣ny ten Thousands of your friends of their best weapons? Oh un∣grateful <HI>England</HI>! dost thou thus requite the Saints for all the good they have been Instruments to procure unto thee? Wilt thou make them enter an appeal in Heaven against thee, in the words of the Prophet? <HI>Jerem.</HI> 18.20. <HI>Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for our Souls; remember O Lord, how we stood before thee to speak good for them; and to turn away thy wrath from them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Are not the professing part of the Nation at this day divided, both in their judgements and affections? and what a singular ad∣vantage the enemy hath; thereby is obvious to every considering person; we have been often told, that except the spirit of <HI>Love</HI> did speedily close up those unchristian breaches, the common adversary would enter in at them, It was a worthy speech of <HI>Brentius</HI> when the Divines of <HI>Germany</HI> were scuffling one with another, in the midst of the Popish party;
<Q><HI>Tollenda merito,</HI> &amp;c let all quarrelling and bit∣terness be laid aside, and let us subject our judgements to our Lord Jesus Christ: Our adversaries yet live and are daily more bold; night and day they labour to extinguish the light of the Gospel which is risen among us, and to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing back the ancient darkness; mean while we who in the beginning, by the grace of God; professed the Gospel unanimousl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turn our weapons one against another, and exhibit a grateful spectacle to our enemies; who place more trust and confidence in our contentions then in the vain foundation of their own Cause, and all their own art and power.</Q></P>
<P>I have a long time look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon our contentions, as upon a Bla∣z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Comet, portending utter desolation, if the Lord heal it not speed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly.

his judgements: How have we beaten our fellow-servants? unsainted those that jump'd not with us in our opinions? this Saint was too high, and that too low; but here is an enemy, that like <HI>Procrustes</HI> the tyrant, will cut you all of a length:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Procrustes▪</HI></NOTE> If you were ten thous∣and more then you are, you were no match for them, as long as you lie in this posture.

I make no question but the Pa∣pists have blown up these sparks of discention among us, to warm their own fingers by our flames; they have animated and fomented that spirit of bitterness and wrath among us, as one that sets two Cocks a fighting; that having killd each other, he may sup upon them both at night. This was the sad posture of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> when the Enemy entred in her Gates. O <HI>England!

which they enjoyed? how impatiently did the people of God in former times, thirst for liberty to worship God purely! and when they had obtained it, What was the use they made of it? <HI>horresco referense,</HI> I tremble in speaking it; did we not play with our Light, fight with our brethren by it, till God blowed out the Candle? and so (I wish I could say) ended the quarrel.</P>
<P>We may say of our liberty, as the Philosopher speaks of waters, <HI>Suis terminis difficile cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nentur,</HI> they are difficultly kept within their bounds; why, brethren did you think that God could suffer such precious mercies to run at the waste spout much longer? Did you think he was weary of his mercies, to continue them to such as little regarded them? or that it was not as grievous to the blessed God, that his children should smite one another, as to see the Enemy smiting them? no darkness is more formidable then that of an E∣clipse, which assaults the very vessels of light: no taste more unsa∣voury then that of sweet things when corrupted; and no sin more hideous, then that which darkens the brightness of Gods love, and corrupts the sweetness of his mercy.

<P>First, It is a False Religion, and that's reason enough to abhor it. You would be loath to be cheated with counterfeit Coin (specially if you were to receive your whole portion in it) how much more with a false Faith; when it amounts to as much as all your souls are worth in another World! the falsity of the Popish Religion (if it yet remain a question with any among us) may be thus evinced.</P>
<P>That Religion which is not built upon the Foundation of the <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="argument"/> Prophets and Apostles, but stands in the wisdom of man, is a False Religion:</P>
<P>But the Popish Religion is not built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, but stands in the wisdom of man; therefore the Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh Religion is a false Religion.</P>

<P>That Religion which ascribes the glory of mans salvation to him∣self, and not to Christ alone, is a false Religion. But the <HI>Popish Re∣ligion</HI><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="argument"/> ascribes the glory of mans Salvation to himself, and not to Christ alone; therefore 'tis a false Religion.</P>
<P>The Major is undeniable; the end of Religion is the glory of God; the Christian Religion utterly excludes the glorying of man in himself, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.27 <HI>Where is boasting then? it is excluded; by what Law? of work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? nay, but by the Law of Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> Tit. 3.5. <HI>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>The Minor may be as easily proved from their own Hystories and Writings, and many other credible Authors.
