<P>The Condition of Gods Wilderness-People (with other considerations also attending the same) bear full witness to it therein; when <HI>the Glory is depart∣ing</HI> (may we not say in some, <HI>Oh that it were not in great measure departed</HI>) and the <HI>Defence also with it;</HI> what more seasonable or fitly-suited then such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the design whereof is to awaken and advise to a Faithful Endeavour for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very and Continuance of both; How far or by what gradual Removes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is made already, with reference to the Lords People here in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Societies in particular, is not so easie nor all things Conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to determine; that there is indeed a diminution or abatement of the <HI>Glory in the midst of us</HI> (an awful presage of its yet further and at last final withdrawing, if not timely prevented by an intervening Repentance, Faith and effectual Reformation, thereby stirring up our selves to take hold of God.) that we are in danger also of being deprived of <HI>the Wall of fire about us</HI> (threatning Aspects of Providence of late appearing towa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds us therein) can∣not well be denied by them that have been studi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us to keep the eye upon things past and present.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the foregoing part of this Chapter we have the Prophet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vision specified, and the sense and meaning of it.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The Vision of a Man with a Measuring Line in his hand, to measure <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the breadth thereof, and in the length thereof, in the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second</HI> Verses.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the sense of this Vision Explained and Confirmed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Explained,</HI> That <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should be Re-inhabited and Repleni∣shed, in the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> Verses.</P>
<P N="2">2. This confirmed with a promise of the Lords presence with them, in this <HI>fifth</HI> Verse: In which we have; (1) A promise of the Lords pro∣tecting presence, and that likened to a <HI>Wall of fire round about; For</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord, <HI>will be to her a Wall of fire round about.</HI> (2.) a promise of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lords glorious presence in the midst of his people, for saith the Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>will be the Glory in the midst of her.</HI> (3.) Let us consider the Copulation, yea, the Connexion of these two, when the Lord was the Glory in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idst of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> then he would be <HI>a Wall of fire round about them,</HI> and his being a <HI>Wall of fire round about them,</HI> was in order to his being <HI>the Glory in the midst of them,</HI> for so it is expounded in <HI>Isai.</HI> 4.5. <HI>Vpon all the Glory shall be the defence</HI>: Hence the Doctrine is this;
<Q>Doct. When the Lord is the Glory in the midst of a People then he will be a Wall of Fire round about them.</Q></P>
<P>The Lords protecting presence as a <HI>Wall of fire round about his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and his Glorious Presence <HI>in the midst of them</HI> are concomitants, the one doth inseparably accompany the other. For the Proof and Explication let us consider:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="000187_0006_0FA3173E45B2FFE8"/>1. When Gods protecting presence is like <HI>a Wall of fire round about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People.</HI> 2. When the Lord is <HI>the glory in the midst of a People.</HI> 3. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Relation and Connexion of these.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Gods protecting presence, <HI>as a Wall of fire,</HI> is when the Lord doth in an evident manner, and terrible manner protect them.</P>
<P N="1">1. In an evident manner; making his Protection as manifest to his People as if they see a <HI>Wall of fire round about them,</HI> Isai. 26.1. <HI>In that day shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Song be sung in the Land of Judah, we have a strong City, the Lord will appoint his Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on for Walls and Bulwarks</HI>: Then is the Wall too high for the Enemy to Scale or climb over, then it is too deep to be un∣dermined, and then the Wall is too high to be broken down or battered; and the Lords Salvation as a Wall of Defence in an evident manner, is, when the Lord doth defend his People, either only by his own hand, or in an extraordinary manner, blessing small and weak means for their defence.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Sometimes the Lord doth defend meerly and only by his own hand; and that is either by taking away the desire of the Enemy, that the Enemy shall not desire to do his People any harm as the Lord Promi∣sed to his People of old, when they went up to appear before the Lord thrice in the year, <HI>at that time no man shall desire their Land,</HI> Exod <HI>34.24</HI> they should at that time be so safe from invasion; or if the Enemy shall desire and attempt to do his People harm: yet sometimes the Lord by his immediate hand stirreth up the spirit of some <HI>Cyrus</HI> to be their Pro∣tectour, as the People, of whom the Text doth speak, did finde it upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> experience, <HI>Ezra 1.1.</HI> or if the Lord shall permit the Serpent to cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his mouth Waters <HI>like a flood after the Woman fled into the wilderness</HI>: yet the Lord who ruleth in Heaven above, and on the Earth, will some∣times make use of the Earth to help the Woman, <HI>and the Earth shall open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mouth and swallow up the floods the Dragon had cast out of his mouth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 12 15, 16.</HI> and thus he doth defend his People only by his own hand.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Or by his blessing of weak and small means for their defence and that is, either when his People are in a fearful and affrighted posture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was with the King of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and his People when they heard of the Confederacie of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> against them, the heart of the King of <HI>Iudah</HI> and his People were moved as the Trees in the Wood are moved with the wind, <HI>Isai 7.2.</HI> and yet the Lord made it manifest, that they were but as the two tails of smoak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng fire brands, <HI>soon extinguished,</HI> ver. 4. or when his People are in a divided state, that they cannot so unite in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of means for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they might, as it was in
<PB N="3" REF="000187_0007_0FA3173F07917060"/>
<HI>Deborah</HI>'s time, for the divisions of <HI>Reuben</HI> were great thoughts of heart, and again for the divisions of <HI>Reuben</HI> were great thoughts of heart, <HI>Iudg.</HI> 5.15. and yet the Lord gave them a Song of Triumph, and the conclu∣sion was, O <HI>God let thine Enemies p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rish, and those who love thee be as the Sun when it goeth forth in its might, and so the Land had rest,</HI> Judg. 5. ult. and in what a feeble state was <HI>Ierusalem</HI> in <HI>Zerubbabel</HI>'s time, as to de∣fend themselves by any outward means; what a day of small things, and yet the Lord said, <HI>not by might nor by power but by the Spirit of the Lord, and what art thou great mountain b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore Zerubbabel,</HI> Zech 4.5, 6. and thus the Lord defends in an extraordinary manner, by blessing weak means.</P>
<P N="2">2. A defending in a terrible manner; we read in <HI>Exo. 14.24.</HI> that the Lord in the <HI>Morning watch,</HI> right early and timely looked forth upon the Host of <HI>Egyptians</HI> and troubled them: it was a dreadful dismaying and confounding look, <HI>and he looked through the Pillar of fire,</HI> called a Pillar, noting strength and stability; but it stood as a Wall of defence between the <HI>Israelites</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> their Enemies: and in our Text we read of a <HI>Wall of fire,</HI> it scopeth at the same, to shew us how effectually but in a terrible manner the Lord doth defend his People; and that is in such a manner as is terrible to the Enemy, and sometimes at the first appearance of it, is terrible to the Lords people themselves.</P>
<P N="1">1. In such a manner as is terrible to the Enemy, sometimes the Lord by his own immediate hand doth dart into their minds such affrighting Fantasies, and dismaying apparitions as shall fill their Ears, Heads and Hearts with such confounding noises and reports, which shall make them like the <HI>Syrians</HI> of old, whom the Lord caused to hear the noise of the Chariots and Horse-men, as the noise of a great Host, and they rose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and fled away, 2 <HI>King. 7.6.</HI> we read of <HI>Zions</HI> Enemies in <HI>Psal. 48.5, 6, 7, 8.</HI> they saw, they were troubled, and they hasted away, Fear took hold of then as <HI>of a woman in travel,</HI> there thou breakest the Ships of <HI>Tarshish,</HI> as we have heard so we have seen in the City of our God, he will Establish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Selah</HI>: This is to defend his People in such a manner as is terrible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. And sometimes in such a manner, as at the first aspect and app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rance seemeth terrible to his people: the Lord will sometimes make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a terrible means to be the carrier of the answer of the Prayers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People, <HI>Psal. 65.5. thou dost answer us by terrible things in thy righteous∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss O God of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Salv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,</HI> and the Lord chooseth to relieve by terrib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> things, <HI>Isai. 4.3. thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dst terrible things which we looked not for when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="000187_0008_0FA3173FC92F0360"/>
camest down, and the Mountains flowed down at thy presence, we did no more expect relief by such a means then to see Mountains to melt and become a plain</HI>; it is of our selves to destroy our selves, but it is the Lord alone can save us by destroying means, to make use of a Bear to preserve a Lamb is a strange and marvellous thing, but <HI>Persia</HI> was likened to a Bear, in <HI>Dan.</HI> 7 5. and <HI>Cyrus</HI> the King of <HI>Persia</HI> must become to be Protectour of the Lambs company, <HI>Ezra</HI> 1.1, 2. this is to defend his People by a <HI>Wall of Fire</HI> in a terrible manner.</P>
<P>Only let us distinguish of the degree of Protection:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Sometimes the Protection is total and full without any loss at all to Gods People, that whatever the Blasphemous threatnings of a <HI>Rab∣shekah</HI> hath been in the day of Reproach and time of <HI>Zions</HI> trouble, yet the Lord putteth a Hook into the Nose, and a Bridle into the Lips of the Enemy, and would not suffer them so much as to come into the City, nor shoot an Arrow, nor come before them with a Shield, <HI>Isai. 37.38.</HI> then the Protection is total and plenary.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sometimes the Lord only defends the Body of his People, the most considerable part of them, and then the loss they suffer shall be va∣lued at a very considerable price; when <HI>Joshua</HI> had lost about thirty six men, and had sought out and removed the accursed thing, it then must cost the Enemy no less then <HI>twelve thousand</HI> lives, <HI>Josh.</HI> 7.8—25. the Lord will make it manifest that <HI>precious in his sight is the death of his Saints, Psal. 116.15.</HI> if a Godly man did foresee at what price the Lord of Hosts doth value his life, and how many lives it must cost the Enemy, if he doth suffer the loss of his own life in the cause of God, &amp; for his People, it would make him surely content <HI>Sampson</HI> like, to lay down his life even among the <HI>Philistims</HI>: thus you have heard how the Lords protecting presence is as <HI>a Wall of fire round about the Lords People,</HI> the conclusion of this, <HI>who is like to thee O Israel? a People saved of the Lord, the shield of thine help, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of thine excellency, thine Enemies sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be found Lyars to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places,</HI> Deut. 32. ult. and of this protect∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g presence, as a <HI>wall of fire</HI> the Lords Peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e both in <HI>Old England</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>New England</HI> have enjoyed their time of experience in dayes of old and lately, and in particular this Colony hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it to be true: let your Enemies in this case be Judges; here are many of you in this great Congregation, now appearing this day before the Lord, who are his wit∣nesses, and are ready to say, as we have heard so we have seen in the City of our God, <HI>the Lord is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be a refuge,</HI> Psal. 48.2.

he was thus known in dayes of old to the confusion of your Enemies, and in that day known to you for your abundant joy.</P>
<P>But at present let us tarry no longer upon the proof of that which is so plain in the Word and Works of the Lord, in the several Generations of the Saints; and to our own experience in dayes of old, and to this very day: but let us proceed to enquire when will the Lord be a <HI>Wall of Fire round about a People?</HI> the answer to this is from the second part of the Doctrine, <HI>VVhen the Lord is the Glory in the midst of his People, then he will be a wall of fire round about them</HI>; and therefore let us enquire concerning this Glory, omitting the multiplicity of Interpretations of that Word, and coming as nextly and directly to the true Gospel sense of it (as I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I take it may be thus described: This <HI>Glory</HI> is the Splendor and Shine of Divine Excellency; as God is a God of Mercy and Holiness, appearing in the Glass of his Word and Ordinances, whereby he transformeth a Peo∣ple into his likeness, and disposeth them practically to his praise and Glory.</P>

And the Mercy Seat was a Type of the Throne of Grace, where Christ our merciful High Priest is enthroned, and from whence for his Mercy sake he hath promised to meet with, and graciously to commune with his People in the times and cases of difficulty whatsoever: <HI>O thou that dwellest between the Cherubims shine bright</HI>; the shine of his Mercy from the Throne of Graces, and then it followeth, <HI>stir up thy strength and come and save us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As he is the God of Holiness; the shine of his Mercy in a ve∣ry pure and holy manner called <HI>the Beauties of Holiness,</HI> Psal. <HI>110.3.</HI> and the <HI>Cherubims</HI> which are called <HI>Seraphims</HI> in <HI>Isai. 6.3.</HI> were crying in the Temple, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts</HI>: and when the Lord doth appear amongst a People to be Glorious in Holiness, then he will be fear∣ful in Praises, and do wonderful things for their safety, <HI>Exod. 15.11.</HI> Jer. <HI>2.2, 3.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Appearing in the Glass of the Word and Ordinances; there is a Glory appearing in the Glass of divine Providences, and is called <HI>a Glory,</HI> Exod. <HI>16.7, 10.</HI> but the Glory in the midst of a People seemeth to be rather a Glory appearing in the Glass of the Word and Ordinances; that which was typified by the Glory which came first into the Tabernacle of old when finished, <HI>Exod.</HI> 40.34. the Glory which likewise came into the first Temple, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.10. the Glory which came into the second Temple of which our Text speaketh, and is so expounded in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.4. and applied to that very time in <HI>ver.</HI> 7. <HI>For</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>the place of my Throne▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Soles of my feet, where I will dwell amongst the Children of Israel,</HI> and this Tabernacle Glory, and Temple Glory was a Type of the true Gospel Glory: for now as in a Glass (namely) in the Glass of Word and Ordinances we behold the Glory of the Lord, <HI>2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ult</HI> and a Type of the Glory of the <HI>new Jerusalem</HI> spoken of in <HI>Rev 21</HI> and upon this Glory thus shining in the Glass of the Word and Ordinan∣ces is the promised defence, <HI>Isai.</HI> 4.5.</P>

<P N="2">2.
