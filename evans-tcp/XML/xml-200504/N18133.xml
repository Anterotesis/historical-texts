<HEAD>THE BLESSINGS OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM xvi. 6.</BIBL>
<Q>THE LINES ARE FALLEN UNTO ME IN PLEASANT PLACES; YEA, I HAVE A GOODLY HERITAGE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these words the Psalmist celebrates the agreeable and advantageous situa∣tion in which he was placed by Divine Providence. It was such as administered to his earthly comfort, and tended to pro∣mote his eternal welfare.</P>
<P>THE like manner of expression may, with propriety, be used by every Ameri∣can; and it affords, on this auspicious day, a suitable and profitable subject for our meditation. By the choice of it, I shall, at least, avoid the beaten path of a minute re∣cital of events during our revolution; and
<PB N="8" REF="023504_0006_0FBFCD0ADFF601C0"/>
if the performance disappoint the hopes, or if some things be introduced which would, at any other time, be improper in the pulpit, a judicious and candid audience will readily excuse me.</P>
<P>WITHOUT incurring the charge of local prejudices, illiberal aspersions of others, or unreasonable partiality to ourselves, we may say, that our country is highly favor∣ed of God; that the <HI>lines,</HI> which measure our inheritance, <HI>are fallen in pleasant pla∣ces; yea,</HI> that we <HI>have a goodly heritage.</HI> This will appear when we consider the natural advantages which we enjoy; the constitution of our civil government; and our religious privileges. Let us take a cursory view of each of these; and then attend to some reflections which the sub∣ject, together with the occasion, may in∣spire.</P>
<P>FIRST, The natural advantages of our country are many and great. The terri∣tory is extensive, the soil luxuriant, the climates and productions various. We
<PB N="9" REF="023504_0007_0FBFCD0CD52C9010"/>
possess in abundance every thing necessary for our support, comfort and strength. The lofty mountains and the fruitful val∣lies, the waving forests and the spreading lawns, the magnificent rivers and the com∣modious harbours contribute to the delight and accommodation of the inhabitants. The means of exportation abroad, and of intercourse with one another, are conve∣nient and easy.</P>
<P>IN the diversity of the advantages which the States enjoy there is a resemblance to the division of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel. To Judah was given a country abounding with vines and pasture; to Asher, one plenteous in oil, iron and brass; to Zebulon and Issachar, such as was famous for sea-ports; and thus, were dis∣tributed among them their respective gifts, which, while they needed not to depend on other nations, taught them the necessity of union among themselves, as conspiring to promote their common welfare. Is not the general description, which is given of
<PB N="10" REF="023504_0008_0FBFCD0E5406A9C8"/>
their country, equally, if not more applica∣ble to our own? <HI>A land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil-olive, and honey; a land where∣in thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> viii. 7. 8, 9.</NOTE> He, whose <HI>the sea is,</HI> and whose <HI>hands formed the dry land,</HI> hath here lavished his bounty, and, as if on pur∣pose, reserved the best for the latest dis∣covery; he hath united, in this one, all the excellencies of the other parts of the earth.</P>
<P>THOUGH much still remains to be done, yet the improvement of these advantages has been, for the time, uncommonly rapid. Less than two centuries ago, what was this now pleasant country? A dismal wilder∣ness; the habitation of wild beasts, and of savage men. Where now the populous
<PB N="11" REF="023504_0009_0FBFCD1640B08768"/>
city lifts its spires, the solitary wigwam stood; where commerce spreads its sails, was seen the bark canoe; and where the found of industry is heard, and all the arts of civilized life flourish, indolence, rude∣ness, and ignorance, held a gloomy reign. If our country has, so suddenly, risen into eminence, what may be expected when time has given it maturity, rendered its population complete, and called forth all its exertions? Then will it be rich, power∣ful, and happy. Then will <HI>her wilderness</HI> become <HI>like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanks giving, and the voice of melody.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah</HI> V. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>As we are not left to depend upon other countries for our necessaries and comforts, so our being removed at so great a distance from them, is no small advantage. We have thus, less temptation to invade, and are less liable to be invaded: we are in less danger of being infected with foreign vices,
<PB N="12" REF="023504_0010_0FBFCD18284280D8"/>
and involved in intrigues and wars. Hap∣pily, indeed, that desire of conquest, and love of domination, which have so long actuated the kingdoms of the world, and made man a scourge to man do not actuate our nation. Separated, by Providence, from the continual jealousies, and bloody dissensions of the old world, our endeavour is, to cultivate every useful art, to enjoy in peace, the blessings which Heaven hath bestowed, and to extend them to all within our reach. This is a more noble ambition than Romans everknew; a more just glory than to enlarge our dominion, or seek to build our advancement on the degradation of others.</P>
<P>IT is cause of regret at this day, that the sword which had been sheathed, is now drawn against some of the Indian tribes. Who does not ardently wish, that peace may be speedily restored; that the natives of this land, instead of being extirpated, may exchange the hatchet for the book of divine knowledge; and that we may be
<PB N="13" REF="023504_0011_0FBFCD199E23C648"/>
brought to rejoice together as children of the same Almighty Parent, and partakers of the same common nature! Though it be ordered, in the course of events, that we possess their land, yet we owe them justice and charity; we owe them our at∣tempts to recover them from abasement, that so they may enjoy with us the desira∣ble inheritance.</P>
<P>IN short, when we consider the manner in which this new world has been opened to us, its first settlement, the growing num∣ber of its inhabitants, the great advanta∣ges afforded, the prospects still in view, with every circumstance, may we not ad∣dress the supreme Ruler of the universe in these beautiful words of the Psalmist? <HI>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goodly cedars.
<PB N="14" REF="023504_0012_0FBFCD1C7ADBBBD8"/>
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm,</HI> lxxx. 8—11.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT all these natural advantages would be in vain, were we deprived of liberty. We could then neither improve, nor enjoy them. Oppression breaks the spirits of men, and sinks them into gross and stupid ignorance. Time was, when Demosthenes shook all Greece with the tempest of his eloquence; and when Cicero, in his flow∣ing strains, gained on the Roman Senate. Greece and Rome were then free. Liber∣ty is now gone, and their glory is no more. Time was, when there were seven churches in Asia, and pure religion beamed, where now ignorance and superstition brood, and where the Turk, dreaming of a Mahome∣tan paradise, sleeps his life away. The inhabitants of these places seem, at present, to be a different race of men. Even the milk and honey of Canaan are long since converted into gall and wormwood. The finest country, when enslaved, is a region,
<PB N="15" REF="023504_0013_0FBFCD1F0E31DD88"/>
of darkness, poverty, and barbarity, in which human beings drag out a miserable existence.</P>
<L>"What is life?</L>
<L>"'Tis not to stalk about and draw fresh air</L>
<L>"From time to time, or gaze upon the sun:</L>
<L>"'Tis—to be free. When liberty is gone,</L>
<L>"Life grows insipid, and has lost its relish.</L>
<P>This leads me to remark,</P>
<P>IN the second place, That we inherit <HI>pleasant places,</HI> on account of the constitu∣tion of our civil government. This has not been imposed upon us by the will of a conqueror, nor received through necessity, but formally and deliberately chosen by ourselves. When obliged to separate from that empire to which we belonged, parti∣cular constitutions were framed by the se∣veral States, and articles of confederation for the government of the whole, on such principles as were then judged to be con∣formable to the equality in human na∣ture, and consistent with public peace and tranquility.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="023504_0014_0FBFCD27171E3A68"/>
IT becomes us here, to acknowledge with gratitude, the peaceable and unani∣mous manner in which a change, in our national government, has been effected. Experience having shown the defects of the first, another, after long consultation, has been proposed and adopted; yea, amendments again to this have been offer∣ed, and time, we trust, will bring it to as much perfection as human things will ad∣mit. We have beheld a people, distant, and various in their habits, united beyond the most sanguine expectation; a constitution formed in the bosom of peace; received by all the States, after full and able discus∣sion in each; enforced by no other wea∣pons than reason and argument; no other thunder heard than the thunder of debate. Has God, then, at any time, interposed more remarkably for us? Do we not, every thing considered, stand single among all the nations of the earth? Other revolutions may have been more diversified and splen∣did, but, surely, none is more honorable
<PB N="17" REF="023504_0015_0FBFCD27D4BEA758"/>
to human nature, and none so likely to produce such happy effects.</P>
<P>As far as this constitution has been tried, its influence is found to be safe and benefi∣cial. It is a representation of the people from whom all legitimate government is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. It is a government of laws, not o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men. It promises to unite mildness and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ergy; to secure and defend; to steer the happy medium between oppression and li∣centiousness. It is calculated to encourage genius, and bring merit to view from the obscure walks of life. Titles and birth give no claim to rank or precedence; but a capacity for business, with learning, elo∣quence, and virtue, are the surest ways to rise to honor and preferment.</P>
<P>IT is foreign, however, to my desig<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pronounce an eulogium on the constitution. There are those who can better paint its excellencies, and those who are more eagle-eyed to scan its defects, and watch its ten∣dency. It rather belongs to my place to
<PB N="18" REF="023504_0016_0FBFCD295EF1F770"/>
celebrate the goodness of God, in confer∣ring upon us the blessing of liberty. How eligible does our situation appear, when we look around us in the world! Only a small part enjoys even the shadow of liberty. The great bulk of mankind are under the most galling and ignominious servitude. A few are exalted to more than men, and the rest made less, to the debasement and reproach of human nature. Surely the distinction in favor of ourselves deserves an honorable mention, and the highest praise is to be ascribed to the <HI>Father of lights, from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh down.</HI></P>
<P>CIVIL liberty is a blessing the more pre∣cious, because with it are connected the rights of conscience. Where slavery pre∣vails these are always infringed. In this country, as they are well understood, so they are preserved inviolate. This is</P>
<P>THE last respect in which it appears that we have <HI>a goodly heritage.</HI> Here, no par∣ticular
<PB N="19" REF="023504_0017_0FBFCD2B92729C48"/>
modes of faith, or worship are established. No undue preference is given to one denomination of religion above an∣other. Every one stands upon equal foot∣ing, and can prove successful, only by the piety, virtue, learning, and liberality of its professors. Human establishments have always been made engines of state-policy; they have promoted hypocrisy and infi∣delity: they have perpetuated error, and restrained that free spirit of enquiry which conduces to improvement.</P>
<P>THE government which Jesus Christ hath instituted in his Church is distinct from the power which appertains to the kingdoms of this world, and it consists in inflicting spiritual pains; in admonitions, reproofs, censures, and exclusion from membership. The members of the Church, indeed, are also members of civil society, and subject to all its laws, so far as is consistent with a good conscience; but the great evil has been in the civil magistrate usurping the throne of Christ and exercising spiritual
<PB N="20" REF="023504_0018_0FBFCD32AD302168"/>
dominion. The Church and the State, no doubt, mutually assist and support one an∣other, but they have, too often, been un∣lawfully blended. The Church asks and needs no assistance except the protection of its rights; and it willingly yields to ci∣vil government the surest support, by dif∣fusing knowledge, and promoting righte∣ousness and peace among men.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS freedom banished from eve∣ry other corner of the earth has erected her standard in these States, and kindly invites the oppressed from all quarters to repair hi∣ther. Here are no fire and faggots, no pains and emoluments of any kind, to force these sentiments, or the other upon them. Reli∣gion pure and undefiled solicits their regard. The heaven-born maid is not dressed or daubed with human inventions. She trusts to her native charms and asks a willing love.—Here is an asylum for you, our brethren of the old world, whose lives are embittered by the cruel impositions of men; the fruit of whose labours go to support
<PB N="21" REF="023504_0019_0FBFCD36008865F8"/>
lazy priests and luxurious princes; who, though you rise early and late take rest, obtain only a scanty subsistence for your∣selves and families. Forsake your hard task-masters. Refuse to dig an ungrateful soil which will not yield you bread. Haste you to the fertile plains of America. Fill her new, and as yet, uninhabited territory. She opens wide her arms to embrace mil∣lions, and waits to crown all the industri∣ous and virtuous with plenty and happi∣ness. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> WESTERN TERRITORY <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></NOTE></P>
<P>NOT only do we enjoy the right of pri∣vate judgment in matters of conscience, but the gospel is preached and its ordinances administered throughout a great part of our land. Without this we would be less civil∣ized, and less free. This truly renders our land a <HI>pleasant place</HI> and a <HI>goodly heritage.</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="023504_0020_0FBFCD36D8256198"/>
What is this world but the beginning of an eternal scene? What is an extensive and beautiful country, what liberty with all its concomitant blessings, destitute of the wor∣ship of our Creator, and the hope of dwell∣ing in his presence when the fashion of this world shall have passed away? Though the rights of man be invaluable, yet we may successfully plead for these and be for∣ever unhappy hereafter. <HI>This is life eter∣nal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xvii. 3.</NOTE> The abundant means of this knowledge are within our power.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the situation of our coun∣try in this respect, we see these words of the prophet fulfilled; <HI>The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Car∣mel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of
<PB N="23" REF="023504_0021_0FBFCD39DF0E3200"/>
the Lord, and the excellency of our God—In the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isaiah,</HI> xxxv. 1. 2. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAVING now shown, that the words of the Psalmist equally express our own pri∣vileges, and are an acknowledgment highly proper from each of us, let us reflect more particularly,</P>
<P>FIRST, On the distinguishing goodness of God in giving us this fair inheritance, and in defending it against those who sought unjustly to deprive us. <HI>The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> xxiv. 1.</NOTE> Of whom is it, that we inhabit this land rather than another? Of whom, that we are surround∣ed with so many blessings? Of whom, that we enjoy civil and religious liberty? Surely it is of the Lord, and he is entitled to all the praise. He gave to the renowned Co∣lumbus that spirit of curiosity, that bold∣ness of enterprise, that contempt of danger,
<PB N="24" REF="023504_0022_0FBFCD405CDC4A58"/>
and that firmness of perseverance, which led him through unexplored seas and distress∣ing hardships, to the discovery of this vast continent; where he found the native "girt with feather'd cincture, naked else and wild among the trees on isles and woody shores." It was the Lord who conducted to this place the original settlers, supported them under all their difficulties, <HI>cast out the heathen before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made them to dwell in their tents." </HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> lxxviii. 55.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOT to carry our attention so far back, who, of later years, hath sustained us in a mighty contest for every thing which we held dear? Who united us in a common cause? Who inspired and enabled us, un∣acquainted with war, and unprepared, to withstand an experienced and formidable enemy? Who disconcerted their strata∣gems, gave us powerful allies, encouraged our suffering army, crowned them with signal victories, and who, in so short a
<PB N="25" REF="023504_0023_0FBFCD43A493F3E0"/>
time, gladdened our hearts with peace? Of whom is it, that to day we commemo∣rate our existence as a nation, and rejoice in the prospect of growing prosperity? Surely these are the doings of the Lord, whose interpositions in our favor were so numerous and remarkable, that they can never be forgotten. When this page of history is revolved, it will <HI>shew to the ge∣neration to come, the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> Ixxviii. 4—6.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHAT must have been our condition, had our enemies succeeded? What could we have expected from a nation which dared, in the face of Heaven, to assert a right to bind us "in all cases whatsoever," and which strove to enforce it with cruelty and blood? What could we have expected from them, when opposed and irritated,
<PB N="26" REF="023504_0024_0FBFCD4516B80658"/>
but every thing the disappointed hopes, the mortified pride, and the incensed wrath of tyrants could inflict? What but desola∣tion, slavery, and death? What, at the best, but a life less tolerable than the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar, which was heated <HI>seven times</HI> for those who disobeyed his unrigh∣teous decree? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Absolute power has made tyrants in every age, and the temper of all tyrants is unrelenting. To these who have a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of Liberty, death, in any form, is less <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than abject submission. Better to suffer death at exit, than to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on a rock. Indeed, when the rights of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are violated, it be∣comes a duty to prefer death to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compliance; and many thousand, in former days, have suffered worse than the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Nebuchadnezzar, rather than live in disobedience to their God.</HI></NOTE> The fruitful field would soon have returned to a wilderness, the nerves of industry and improvement been withered, and a languid spiritless temper pervaded the inhabitants. We would have been labourers in a vineyard not our own, and though we had borne the heat and burden of the day, a foreign and unjust lord, if he rewarded us with a penny, would
<PB N="27" REF="023504_0025_0FBFCD476931E9E8"/>
have given us with it, frowns and ill-usage.—There is no pleasure, even in hinting these things, farther than may be necessary to show the greatness of our deliverance. Spirit and ability are given us, not only to repair our wastes, but to add new improve∣ments and ornaments; and as the external traces of the war must soon be effaced, so ought every unchristian resentment to be forever effaced from our breasts.—Blessed be the ETERNAL SOVEREIGN who decreed us victorious; who re-animated expiring liberty, snatched her from the feet of kings, and exhibited her in her winning form, to enlighten, to guide, and to charm the world. <HI>O sing unto the Lord a new song. O clap your hands, all ye people, shout unto God with the voice of triumph. For the Lord most High is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing prais∣es unto our King, sing praises. Both young men and maidens, old men and children: Let them praise the name of the Lord; for

his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalms</HI> xlvii, cxlviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT has not been unusual, nor will it damp the joy of this day, to remember with ten∣der regard those, who fired in their coun∣try's cause, stepped foremost to the field, and bravely offered up their lives in its defence. They did not live to enjoy the privileges for which they contended, but their memory shall be dear to us, and pos∣terity shall do justice to their worthy char∣acter. We will teach our <HI>sons sons</HI> how early and how nobly WARREN fell. MONT∣GOMERY, that high-sounding name, with M'PHERSON, HENDRICKS, CHEESEMAN, shall swell the tale. To show the price of li∣berty, we will uncover MERCER'S bleeding wounds, and traverse all the fields of death. But why do I mention names? It seems almost injustice to others who equally me∣rit our praise. Let the historian faithfully tell them all, from WARREN down to LAU∣RENS, whose blood last streamed in the cause. They have nobly fallen. As often
<PB N="29" REF="023504_0027_0FBFCD53155ABC60"/>
as we celebrate this day, while we trim the laurels on their graves, let the recollection of their virtues animate us with the love of our country, that for it, when called, like them we may die.</P>
<P>WHAT tribute shall be here paid to those who cheerfully underwent every danger and toil? Who marched, and fought and bled? What tribute to the remains of a most meritorious army? What tribute to their patriotic Leader whom it hath pleas∣ed God to endow with so many rare ta∣lents, and to make no less distinguished in the arts of peace than of war? Behold the rich inheritance with which Providence hath rewarded your virtuous struggle! Your swords were drawn not only in de∣fence of all which we held dear, but in defence of the rights of mankind. Under God you have been successful. <HI>His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</HI> May you live long to enjoy the blessings which you have been instrumen∣tal in procuring, and may generations yet to come arise and call you blessed.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="023504_0028_0FBFCD56AF78FC10"/>
ANOTHER important reflection on this subject, and the last which shall be men∣tioned is, that the privileges conferred upon us call for our faithful and diligent improvement. Is our country pleasant and fertile? It is our duty to contribute to the advancement of agriculture, manufac∣tures and commerce. Are we a free peo∣ple? It is our duty to support and encour∣age government; to be obedient subjects; to diffuse knowledge among all classes of men, as being the most effectual safe-guard of liberty. Enlighten mankind and you cannot enslave them. Despotic govern∣ment makes them ignorant and barbarous, and when thus reduced, they are neither able nor willing to break the yoke.</P>
<P>To call to mind the natural equality of men, to keep alive the spirit of liberty, and to diffuse knowledge and happiness, have given rise to subordinate societies in free States; and these are held out as the great objects of that Society at whose desire I ad∣dress you to day. They are plainly and
<PB N="31" REF="023504_0029_0FBFCD57DDE42D08"/>
concisely expressed in these word; of their public constitution: "It shall connect in the indissoluble bonds of PATRIOTIC FRIENDSHIP, AMERICAN BRETHREN, of known attachment to the political rights of human nature, and the liberties of this country." Somewhat similar are the revo∣lution and constitutional Societies in Great∣Britain, and which are at this day the watch-towers of liberty. May we not hope that these Societies will emulate one another, in preventing all sacrilegious ap∣proaches to the altar of freedom, and that they will themselves be bright examples of order, decency, and virtue! It is to the honor of that Society, at whose motion we are convened, that under its direction and patronage a <HI>Museum</HI> has been established, to consist, not only of natural curiosities, but of all those writings, either at home, or abroad, which serve to furnish a com∣plete history of this country in its various stages. Many of those curious and valua∣ble tracts must have, otherwise, been lost. The laudable design of preserving them, is
<PB N="32" REF="023504_0030_0FBFCD5988FD1A08"/>
perfectly agreeable to the generous princi∣ples of the Society, and indeed, to that public spirit which is so conspicuous in this great and flourishing city.</P>
<P>ALLOW me only to add, that the name, which this Society has appropriated, affords to the mind a striking contrast of what this country once was, to what it now is; of its once barbarous, to its now civilized state; and if such an association of men have a tendency to introduce a national spirit and character, it will be so far use∣ful; for certainly it is the glory, and ought to be the ambition of every one, who makes his residence in this country, to be esteemed an AMERICAN. Making due allowance for our age and numbers, we have produced as many eminent men as fall to our share; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See this matter fairly and ingeniously stated by Mr. Jeffer∣son in his notes on Virginia. It is, perhaps, not strange that foreigners should inconsiderately adopt prejudices against us; but if there be any who reside in this country, enjoy all the blessings of it, and who, notwithstanding, undervalue what gives them bread and importance, one would hardly know, whether to pity their folly, or to contemn their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> and it is hoped, are
<PB N="33" REF="023504_0031_0FBFCD63671A9308"/>
free from that European pride which can see no excellencies in a neighbour. Let it be the sincere endeavour of us all, by every just and proper method, to advance the interest and reputation of our country; to make it virtuous, enlightened, and free.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Remember, O my friends, the laws, the rights,</L>
<L>" The generous plan of power deliver'd down</L>
<L>" (So dearly bought, the price of so much blood)</L>
<L>" O let it never perish in your hands!</L>
<L>" But piously transmit it to your children."</L>
</LG>
<P>MAY we not indulge the pleasing thought, that the time is not far distant, when ty∣ranny every where shall be destroyed; when mankind shall be the slaves of mon∣sters and idiots no more, but recover the true dignity of their nature! The cause of Liberty is continually gathering strength. The advocates of despotic rule must fail.

though he sublimely rave, he raves in vain. No force of genius, no brilliancy of fancy, and no ornament of language can support his wretched cause. He and his abettors only hasten its downfal. The revolution in France is great—is astonishing—is glo∣rious. It is, perhaps, not just to say, that the flame was kindled by us, but certainly we contributed to blow and increase it, as France will in other nations; until blaze joining blaze, shall illumine the darkest and remotest corners of the earth.</P>
<P>IN return for the great and inestimable privileges which we enjoy, let us devote ourselves to the service of God, and be found in the practice of all righteousness. Virtue is highly necessary for the support of order and good government; and the Christian religion powerfully inculcates,
<PB N="35" REF="023504_0033_0FBFCD66D8D8AFF0"/>
and leads to the exercise of this virtue. Let us comply with its precepts, and pray for its universal spread and influence. Nothing would so conduce to our national prosperity and happiness. It would make us better citizens, and more disinterested patriots; more happy in ourselves, and more useful to all around us. Before I conclude this discourse, allow me then, as a Minister of the Lord Jesus Christ, to offer you salvation in his name; to remind you, that you must soon leave all terresti∣al scenes, and enter upon an eternal and unchangeable state. Be entreated to ac∣cept <HI>the liberty wherewith Christ makes free;</HI> that so when the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them are no more; yea, when <HI>the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with servent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up,</HI> you may inherit a better country, and live immor∣tal beneath a brighter sun and more ample <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="023504_0034_0FBFCD689DA9EEE0"/>
AND now, while we act on this first stage of our existence, may the Lord <HI>or∣dain peace for us!</HI> May we never hear the drum, the trumpet, and the clang of arms any more in battle; but may peace, lead∣ing in her train religion, knowledge, and liberty, forever dwell with us!</P>
<LG>
<L>" Haste thee, fair peace, thy soft'ning power renew,</L>
<L>" Bless every clime, the old world and the new,</L>
<L>" In friendly league unite each distant shore,</L>
<L>" And bid mankind with anger burn no more.</L>
<L>" Then pure religion's precepts shall prevail;</L>
<L>" Impartial justice poise her balanc'd scale;</L>
<L>" Bright liberty shall wanton in the breeze;</L>
<L>" Innoxious pleasure, philosophic ease;</L>
<L>" Commerce shall then expand without control,</L>
<L>" Where coasts extend, or farthest occans roll.</L>
</LG>
<P>May wars <HI>cease unto the end of the earth;</HI> and <HI>God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,</HI> give to all nations, <HI>the light of the knowledge of his glory, in the face of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<L>NOW elevate your hymns of joy,</L>
<L>With sacred music let these arches ring,</L>

<L>For HE receives the grateful lay,</L>
<L>Whose matchless all-controling sway,</L>
<L>Kings, armies, empires, oceans, worlds obey:</L>
<L>Hence kingdoms fall, while here republics rise</L>
<L>Reason resumes her rights, dumb superstition dies.</L>
</LG>

<L>Since then from Heav'n fair Liberty descends</L>
<L>Her bright'ning advent hail;</L>
<L>'Tis GOD alone emits the high command—</L>
<L>(His great behests fulfil!)</L>
<L>See how the patriot-light'ning bends</L>
<L>Oppression's haughty will;</L>
<L>Wide rends her deep obscuring vail,</L>
<L>While waking glory dawns on ev'ry land.</L>

<L>The aid divine confess!</L>
<L>Sweet Independence crowns the joyous day,</L>
<L>Celestial Freedom owns the genial hour,</L>
<L>To shed her choicest bliss.</L>
<L>When usurpation rais'd her head,</L>
<L>Th'appeal, impartial JUDGE, was madeto THEE,</L>
<L>When darkness o'er th' affrighted land was spread,</L>
<L>THOU bad'st the gloom disperse,th' United States be free!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PARENT of Union, manifest thy power,</L>
<L>Let discord cease,</L>
<L>Fell tyrants kindle mad'ning rage no more;</L>
<L>Diffuse to earth's remotest bound,</L>
<L>The blaze of science, and the smile of peace,</L>
<L>'Till praise resound,</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry clime where human voice be sound:</L>
<L>Advancing on the wings of light,</L>
<L>Let Freedom still extend her golden chain,</L>
<L>And while the nations hail th' auspicious fight,</L>
<L>Commence the blest Immanuel's gentle reign.</L>

<L>Patriots your breath employ,</L>
<L>Your sweetest incense bring:</L>
<L>To GOD, Columbia's King, we homage pay,</L>
<L>His arm protective, tho' unseen adore,</L>
<L>His sacred boon confess:</L>
<L>Sweet independence crowns the signal day;</L>
<L>Freedom selects the gratulating hour</L>
<L>To shed her choicest bliss!</L>
