<P>It may appear by what God hath threatned. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God hath threatned, to such as the point speaks of, may be inflicted on them: but God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath threatned such judgements to such a peo∣ple.

<PB N="7" REF="000330_0011_0FA4AD65712AF9A0"/>
and I will forsake them, as near as they are to me, and as dear as they have been to to me▪ <HI>Deut</HI> 31.17. Many such threatnings are found in the Scri∣pture against <HI>Israel,</HI> who are stiled a people near unto him.</P>
<P>In h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t such as have been near to God, and he near to them, have complained of their being forsaken by God. Thou hast forsaken us, is one of the bitter m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, on record, that the Church of God did often make unto him</P>
<P>What God hath inflicted on such, may be in∣flicted on such again▪ what God hath done to some, he may do to oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs▪ in the same state, and relation: for he is unchangeable. Those that were once the only peculiar people of God, near to God, and had God near to them, yet what is is their condition at this day? A forsaken condi∣tion, is the condition, of the Off-spring of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> Gods Friend, a seed whom he had chosen, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th been so, for above sixteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndred years. God hath been angry with them, and forsaken them, as they were foretold long ago. How is it with the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> that were once famous golden Candlesticks? that had E∣pistles written to them.

<P>In that they may do that, which may deserve a forsaking, therefore they may do that which may actually procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it. They may do that
<PB N="8" REF="000330_0012_0FA4AD665D1CCA10"/>
which may deserve a forsaking, they may through the corruption and unbelief of their hearts for∣sake God, and God may injust judgement reta∣liate, and thereupon forsake them. This is spo∣ken to in the forequoted place, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.16, 17. <HI>They will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them: then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will for∣sake them, and hide my face from them.</HI> So again, 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>But if you forsake him he will for∣sake you</HI>; the first is supposed, <HI>if you forsake him,</HI> the latter is imposed, <HI>he will forsake you</HI>▪</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/> But why doth the Lord forsake such a People? The Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew that he hath no need of any, he hath forsaken many, and may forsake many more, to shew that he hath no need of any. God would have all the world to take notice, (that though all men have need of him, yet) he hath no need of any man.</P>
<P N="2">2. To testifie his Sanctity, and severity against sin. He will not spare them, that have been near him, if they will not spare their sin for him. He is a holy God, and if they will have their sins, and their lusts, and their wayes and their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, he will vindicate his holiness, by infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cting this judgement on them.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be a war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to all that enjoy his gra∣cious presence. That they see that they make much of it, and that they take heed that they
<PB N="9" REF="000330_0013_0FA4AD66FB1AFF28"/>
do not sin against him, and forsake him, and pro∣voke him to forsake them also.</P>
<P><HI>Cant.</HI> The point is to be understood of a peo∣ple that are visibly and externally near and dear to him, and these may be totally and finally for∣saken of God: and yet here it must be noted, that God may exercise a deal of patience, and forbearance toward such as he is about to forsake, he did so with the old world, he did so with the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, he did so with the seven Chur∣ches of <HI>Asia</HI>: he is not wont suddenly, and at once to forsake a people, that have been near and dear to him; but he is wont to give them warn∣ing, and in patience to bear a while with their frowardness, and wait to see if there be any re∣turning to him, before he doth inflict this heavy and sharp judgement.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> It serves to admonish us, not to bear our selves too high, upon the account of priviledges. It is a great priviledge to have the Lord near us, and to be near unto him: and some lean upon this though they abide in their sin, <HI>Micah</HI> 3.10, 11. <HI>They build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with ini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uity, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord amongst us?</HI> But if our de∣portment be not according to our priviledges, if we do not carry it thereafter, by becoming an humble, fruitful, and holy people; the Lord will bring forth this heavy burden against us, we shall be rejected, and forsaken of the Lord, what∣ever
<PB N="10" REF="000330_0014_0FA4AD67AA7B9858"/>
our external priviledges be.</P>
<P>But the second part of the Doctrine; or the second Doctrine may be now spoken to, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it is the heaviest burden, or the sorest of Judgements for the Lord to forsake a people.</HI></P>
<P>There may be two things spoken t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the ma∣nagement of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruth. 1. Arguments to e∣vidence it. 2. The Uses of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God hath threatned it as a very sore judgement, then sure it is so. Now when God hath been angry with a people, he hath manifest∣ed the same by menac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng them with his forsaking them: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he hath been designed to do them a deep displeasure, upon the account of some high provocation he is won to threaten them not by taking away this, or that outward comfort from them, but by taking away himself from them.</P>
<P>And that is a woe indeed, a woe with a witness, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.12. Yea, woe also to them, when I depart from them: this is the wofullest day that such a people are wont to meet with.</P>
<P N="2">2. Gods forsaking a People is a sore judge∣ment, in that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exposes them to all judgements. Sin is a great evil in that it exposes to all evil this is a great evil of punishment, in that it expose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to all pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishments. If God be gone, our guard is gone, and we are as a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ in the midst of E∣nemies, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en down. Our strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that's Gone, for God
<PB N="11" REF="000330_0015_0FA4AD68706DDB90"/>
is our strength, as a carcase without life, is a prey, to beasts or prey; so are a people forsa∣ken of their God, to all their devouring enemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and to infernal, and cursed spirits: they are ex∣posed to mischief, and the malice of all their ma∣lignant enemies. When the Lord had forsaken <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> quickly made a prey of it▪ when they were destitute of God, their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bita∣tion became desolate. There is no Protection to a People, whom the Lord forsake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but they are perplexed on every side.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because the evils that are on such, whom God hath forsaken▪ they are only evils. The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> sometime hath the expression, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 7.5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, an evil, an only evil behold is come.</HI> This is such an evil, an only evil to a people. An evil whilst God is present, may have much good in it, the Lord may sancti∣fie it for abundance of blessing: there is hopes of this whilst the Lord continues amongst them; but if he be gone, it is an only evil, and the evils that come upon them are such, they have no∣thing but evil in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because no creature can then afford any help; for what can creatures do when God is departed, he makes the creatures useful and help∣ful, but without him they can do us no good, stand us in no stead▪ they may say to thee as the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> said to the Woman, that cried <HI>Help O King,</HI> He answered, <HI>If the Lord dont
<PB N="12" REF="000330_0016_0FA4AD6927D3B978"/>
help, whence shall I help thee?</HI> all creatures may say if God be departed, <HI>we cannot help:</HI> Nay the very Devil cannot help if God be gone: when God departed from <HI>Saul,</HI> he sought help from the Devil, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 28.15. <HI>Wherefore</HI> (saith the Devil) <HI>askest thou of me? seeing the Lord is de∣parted from thee.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It appears to be a sore judgement, by the an∣guish and distress, that such have been in, that have been sensible that God hath forsaken them. Sin hath flown in the face of such, and terified them: Oh the blessed God is gone, and if he is gone, mercy is gone; and Oh for such and such sins, that lie upon me! what shall I do? what a moan have Saints themselves made in such a case? as <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 22.1.2. <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me? and from the words of my roaring? Oh my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent.</HI> Oh how <HI>Saul</HI> roared out his distress! and that on this account especially, that God was departed from him, not so much that the <HI>Philistines</HI> were upon him, had not God been gone, he could have dealt well enough with them; but here was the misery, and the sting of the misery, <HI>God was de∣parted from him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 It is a sore punishment, in that it is a great part of the punishment of Hell. The essential parts of that punishment, is pain of loss, and sense,
<PB N="13" REF="000330_0017_0FA4AD6A45C60318"/>

They forsake because they will forsake.</P>
<P N="3">3. Wonder not that Gods Saints have been so solicitous with him, not to forsake them Thus <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 119 8 <HI>Oh forsake me not utterly.</HI> He might well be soli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itous in this matter, for he un∣derstood what it was to be forsaken of the Lord.

<P N="4">4. If Gods for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking be so sore a judgement, it should make us more cautelous, and wary least we pull down this judgement on our heads Men

shewed himself loth to depart from those that have departed from him; but have warned them of his displeasure, that they might stay him. It goes near Gods heart to forsake a People that have been near to him. Methinks I hear him saying thus, <HI>How shall I give thee up, Oh New-England</HI>! thence speaking to warn us, of our forsakings of him, and to be instructed, why? least his Spirit depart from us, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.8. <HI>Be thou instructed Oh Ierusalem, least my Soul depart from thee, least I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</HI> You may easily stay him, the matter is not so far gone, but you might yet stay him were we but as loth he should forsake us, as he is to forsake us, he would never leave us. His g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adual mo∣tions from a people argue his lothness, and un∣willingness to leave them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider what the Lord is to us, or wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t relation he stands in to us, while he is with us. He is our friend, we have found him to be so, and a special friend too: men in the World are not willing to forego a Friend, a good Friend: he is as faithful, skilful, power<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul, and tender-heart∣ed a Friend as ever a people had, he stuck by us when also we had been in a woe case, <HI>Psal.</HI> 124.1. <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our side may Israel now say.</HI> And had not the Lord been on our side, may <HI>New-England</HI> now say.

If he leave us, we shall be as Orphans, for he is related as a Father, and how sad is the state of poor Orphans: and we shall be in a state of Widow-hood, a very soli∣tary, and sorrowful state. He is our guide▪ and our pilot; what will become of the blind if their guid leave them? and what will become of the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p if the Pilot desert it? thus the Lord is to his, and well may he say, as <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.3. <HI>Oh my Peo∣ple what have I done? or wherein have I wearied thee, or given thee any cause to be weary of me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Consider there are shrewd signs of Gods intent to leave us, unless somewhat be done. If you enquire what? I Answer:</P>
<P N="1">1. The sins for which God hath forsaken o∣thers are rise amongst us. The sins for which God fors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok the Jews are our sins.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Deep and high Ingratitude.</HI> Do you that requite the Lord? <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.6.

There is more ju∣stice to be found in hell, then amongst some men on earth: for there is no innocent person op∣pressed there.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Weariness of Gods Ordinances.</HI> Amos 8.5. <HI>When will the Sabbath be done?</HI> They that are weary of the service of God, and the Ordinan∣ces of God, they are weary of God. God in∣deed hath fed us to the full, as to Ordinances: and we are glutted, and surfeited, and have lost our esteem.</P>

If our mercies become our burdens, God will ease us of them.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. Idolatry, which is Spiritual Adultery, and is there nothing of this? chusing of new Gods.</P>
<P N="7">7. Incorrigibleness, or opposition of a spirit of reformation. When God calls to a People to return, by repentance, but they will go on still in their sin: God calls to them by his judg∣ments, and by his Rod; but they will not hear, as 'tis <HI>Ier.</HI> 5.3. <HI>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive Correction: they have made their faces harder than a Rock, they have re∣fused to return.</HI> When it is thus with a People, God will pluck up and be gone; so <HI>Ier.</HI> 7.13, 14 <HI>Because they would not hear, and would not answer the call of God, I will do to this house, as I did to Shiloh,</HI> why? what did the Lord do to Shiloh? ver. 12. <HI>Go to Shiloh, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my People Israel.</HI> Go, and view it, and you will see what he did, he left tokens of

<P N="2">2. Judge your selves worthy to be forsaken, because of your forsaking of him. If you judge
