<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Court, considering how the Lord hath been pleased of late Years, by many wayes and means, to humble, and bring low his poor people in this Wilderness, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Tokens of his great Anger not yet turned away from us, appearing, as in other respects, so also in a signal manner, in the contagious spreading Disease of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and other Distempers; whereby many have been taken away, some Families laid desolate in several places, and sundry of the Lords precious Servants, his dear Ministers, removed from us; the Lord thereby threatning to punish our great Wantonness under, and Weariness of, the pretious Liberties and Sanctuary-Priviledges, which we have for a long time enjoyed: And considering withal, how eminently our Dependence is upon the mul∣titude of the Lords tender Mercies, for the free pardon of whatever hath provoked his holy and jealous Eye; for the amending what is yet a miss among us in all Or∣ders; For the preventing of the Fears of those whose eyes are open to observe the many wayes whereby God is provoked, notwithstanding all the means he hath used to humble and heal us; As also, for his Blessing upon our Labours by Sea and Land, for defeating the Counsels, and rebuking the Malice of the Blood-thirsty Heathen about us; for the giving a good issue to those matters wherewith our Wor∣thy Agents are betrusted; for their safe and seasonable Return; And for the settle∣ment, and future Flourishing of the Colledge, wherein the whole Country is so much concerned: Considering also the sad and deplorable condition of the People and interest of Christ Jesus in forreign parts, and the great Rage of Satan and his instruments in all places:</P>
<P><HI>Do therefore Commend unto the Inhabitants of this Jurisdiction the serious consideration of the premises, and the seasonable work of deep Humiliation un∣der the mighty hand of the Lord: And in particular do appoint Thursday, the sixt Day of</HI> June <HI>next ensuing, to be solemnly kept as a Day of Humiliation and Prayer, throughout this Jurisdiction.</HI></P>
