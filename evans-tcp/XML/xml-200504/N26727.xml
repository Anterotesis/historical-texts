<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"And Moses said unto the people, remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE period of any remarkable and interesting event, which concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the essential welfare, or the political existence of a nation, is truly deserving of remembrance. The children of Israel once enjoyed great prosperity in Egypt; they dwelt in the best of the land, abounded in flocks and herds, as well as in every comfort which that fertile country afforded. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut through the ambition and avarice so prevalent in human nature, those who once favoured them soon became haughty oppressors; they deprived them of their property and rights, and kept them for many years under subjection to cruel task-masters. Their deliverance from this servitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the event, and the time when it was accomplished is the period referred to in the text, where it is said, "<HI>Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</HI>"</P>
<P>How parallel the words, and the circumstances, to the day, and the events, which we are now assembled to commemorate. On this day we ce∣lebrate the independence of our country; this is the day of her political existence among the nations of the earth, the day when she escaped from civil bondage, the aera of her liberty, prosperity and glory; a day pregnant with great events, and worthy to be remembered throughout all generations.</P>
<P>This is the twenty-third Anniversary of our country's freedom; on this day three and twenty years ago, our representatives in Con∣gress assembled, declared these United States of America free and inde∣pendent, broke the bonds that united us to the mother country, and cast off the servile yoke, which degraded us to a state of dependence unworthy of freemen. To defend our invaded rights and privileges, to resist the iron hand of oppression stretched out against us, to preserve our liberties inviolate to the latest posterity, we rose in its defence, and appealed to the sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the justice of our cause, relying upon his protection and support in this time of trial, this critical and arduous contest, big with our infant country's fate. Glorious and important strug∣gle! What spectacle more sublime and interesting, than a nation thus fighting in the cause of freedom, with this motto inscribed on her banners,
<PB REF="035561_0003_1005F31495C48A50"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thy conflict with oppression, when arrayed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> virtue, and animated with the sacred flame of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> forth to meet the rude invading foe; how doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of thy sufferings fill us with grief, and thy succeeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> inspire us with joy. This day reminds us of the happy issue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> contest, of the difficulties and dangers we encountered, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deliverance from national bondage, of our present invaluable privileges civil and religious, and of the obligations we are under to the God of hea∣ven and earth, who by strength of hand brought us out of our difficulties, and delivered us from the power of our enemies: For in the language of inspiration▪ "<HI>Had not the Lord been on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick.</HI>" This then according to the text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a day to be remembered, a day of deliverance, a day of thanksgiving, a day of joy, <HI>the birth day</HI> of our country▪ And we have the same reason to remember this day, as the Israelites had to remember that of their de∣parture from Egypt; for we have experienced a separation and deliverance similar to their's, and accomplished by the same Almighty hand.</P>
<P>This day, then, should be employed in considering the mercies and good∣ness of the Lord, the benefits and favours which he has bestowed upon our country, and in expressions of gratitude and praise to the Father of Light, the eternal and inexhaustible source of all our mercies, temporal as well as spiritual.</P>
<P>But how different is the day often kept, and how absurd is the conduct of many upon it: Instead of gratitude and praise, they exhibit a scene of dissipation and folly; instead of a rational and thankful remembrance of God's benefits, they drown reason by intemperance, and banish gratitude by an abuse of his mercies.</P>
<P>Our joy, therefore, should be regulated by the dictates of reason and religion, our mirth should be mixed with a fear of offending, and our re∣joicing should be in the Lord with trembling: For if we sin against that holy and all powerful God, who by strength of hand has delivered us out of our difficulties, and relieved us from our fears, he can easily make our blessings curses, or remove them far from us, and quickly involve us in all that misery which we dread.</P>
<P>Indeed the late aspect of public affairs has been threatening, the alarm∣ing prospect▪ of war has again been presented to our view, and peace for a while appeared about to take its flight from our borders. From this it seems as if the Lord still has a controversy with us for our sins; that the rod of his judgments is yet suspended over us; and dark louring clouds in our political horizon indicate an impending storm. This should teach us, while we rejoice for temporal blessings, to consider the source from whence they spring, our dependence upon God for their continuance, the obligations we are under to render him an acceptable service, and to guard against ingratitude and abuse of his favours.</P>
<P>We should, therefore, strive to keep the day in a suitable and becoming manner, and we should remember it by having a deep and grateful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="035561_0004_1005F30B11996EA0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God's good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out of weakness he made us strong, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mies of our enemies, and has bestowed upon us the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> liberty and independence. Our remembering the day in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prudent manner, will have a tendency not only to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and to cause our present mercies to be continued, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> down still greater blessings upon our country.</P>
<P>As the events of the day, which we commemorate, are chiefly of a poli∣tical nature, we hope none will object to the introduction of politics in this discourse, from a mistaken notion that they have no connection with religion, and that the God of Providence has no concern in these affairs of men. For nothing but ignorance and illiberality can be the foundation of such reflections. It being evident to every enlightened and unpreju∣diced mind, that as both reason and scripture require us to consider God as the author of our private mercies, and to give thanks for them, he is no less the source of our public political blessings; and we are under the strongest obligations publicly to acknowledge them, and render unto him the praise which is due unto his name.</P>
<P>In prosecuting the subject, we propose,</P>
<P N="1">I. To consider what is implied in remembering the day; which will lead us to mention some of those great and important events respecting our country, which on this occasion demand our remembrance.</P>
<P N="2">II. Point out some of the duties, which naturally result from a recol∣lection of these events.</P>
<P>And <HI>first.</HI> We are to consider what is implied in remembering the day, or to mention some of those great and important events respecting our country, which on this occasion demand our remembrance.</P>
<P>Remembering the day evidently implies a recollection of those things which are most remarkable with regard to it, and were the occasion of its institution, together with all those subsequent events which proceed from it, are connected with it, and respect the same important end, our country's welfare. If we consider the subject in this point of light, the various public blessings of which we are made the subjects, and the hap∣py circumstances in which we are placed, all rise at once and present themselves to our view. And nothing can be more suitable, more decent, and more profitable on this occasion, than a remembrance of the public blessings we enjoy, that we may see the abundant reasons we have for praising the Lord, and feel deeply impressed with a sense of our obligation to it: For thanksgiving is a continual duty, as we are daily receiving renewed mercies; and the inspired apostle directs that we should, "<HI>Give thanks always, for all things, unto God the father, in the name of the Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>And here the great event which first demands our attention on this oc∣casion, is, the Revolution which established our Independence. This glo∣rious event, which is the foundation of our liberties and gave us an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="035561_0005_1005F316D05DC9F0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> occasioned by the injustice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Not contented with the respectful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> colonies towards the mother country, and with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> received from them on all emergencies, in the face of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstitution, which claims no right to tax where there is no represen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on, they arbitrarily burdened us with repeated taxes, notwithstand∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng our frequent remonstrances; and finally, instead of redress of grievan∣ces, resolved that they had a right to bind us in all cases whatsoever, and determined to compel us to unconditional submission to their unjust and arbitrary requisitions.</P>
<P>But Great Britain was mistaken in the spirit that actuated Americans; they were not so easily to be deprived of their property and rights; they were not tamely to be reduced to a state so abject and servile; they were not without a manful and vigorous struggle for the support of liberty to be made, "<HI>hewers of wood and drawers of water,</HI>" to any nation under heaven; and the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance to ty∣ranny and oppression was too gross and palpable a folly to meet with many admirers on this side the Atlantic. Resistance was therefore the conse∣quence of their attempt to enforce their arbitrary exactions, and Ameri∣cans indignant fly to arms. Now war with all its horrors descends upon our once peaceful shores, the vast ocean itself forms no barrier against its dire approach; for its wide surface is burdened with numerous ships, which hither waft the messengers and implements of death. See bands of foreign ruffians landing on our coasts; see how they cover all the shore; see murderous instruments arrayed, the thundering cannon, the destruc∣tive musquet, the pointed bayonet, the glittering sword, the polished spear; see martial banners displayed and long embattled ranks waiting the signal of combat with the sons of freedom, assembled to defend their na∣tive land! The scene of slaughter commences, the roar of cannon and musquetry, the clashing of arms, the beating of drums, the cries of the wounded, the groans of the dying, ascend at once in mingled tumult and confuse the ear. Rank closes up with rank, the earth is tinged with pur∣ple gore and strewed with human carcases. The king of terrors erects his bloody standard in the midst, and waves it triumphant over▪ this scene of carnage; the grim tyrant with his destroying sword mows down whole ranks at once, regards neither youth nor age, spares neither virtue nor talents, cowards nor heroes, but with merciless look stalks through the field over heaps of slain, and scatters around him promiscuous destruction. Mark that band of heroes foremost in the fight, who lead the sons of free∣dom on to battle. Melancholy scene! The rude destroyer makes a near approach to them, strides across their way, and brandishes his fatal dart. Then Warren, Montgomery, Mercer and other brave heroes fell. Oh! what a fall was that for you my country! If virtue, talents, courage, be∣nevolence, humanity and love of country could have saved, you would not thus have fallen. Behold them, my countrymen! The glory of America has fallen in battle upon the high places; encircled in the arms of death they lie, and no kind friend at hand had they, to sooth their expiring mo∣ments: But children, wives and friends had they forsaken, to spill their blood in their beloved country's cause: Their mangled limbs, their bleed∣ing wounds, their breathless bodies, are the costly sacrifices, which they

A debt of gratitude is there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> due to their memory, and on this day should we faithfully discharge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> These are the martyrs of freedom, and dear indeed should they be to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for they perished to preserve our liberty. Great was their worth, great was their patriotism: Let their names be inscribed not only on pillars of marble and monuments of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss, but let them be more deeply engraved on our hearts; let us teach the lisping infant to stammer out their fame; let us venerate and strive to imitate their virtues; let us drop a tear of gra∣titude to their remembrance. Yes, illustrious heroes, who fell in the cause of American liberty; your names shall live immortal in the annals of your country; they shall never be buried but in its ashes; one generation shall hand them on to another, till the end of time; and at each return of this anniversary of our country's independence, they shall be precious to the so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of freedom, and shall be mentioned with all that glow of patriotic affection, which even gratitude itself can inspire.</P>
<P>And whilst on this day we celebrate our independence, let us thus re∣member the price we paid for it, even the best blood and treasure of our country. Imagine not my hearers that such descriptions are needless; for these scenes of woe, this bloody tragedy, were once serious realities, in which we were too nearly concerned to think them trifles, and we should not even now remain unaffected at their remembrance; for un∣less we are deeply and feelingly impressed, with a sense of the evils and horrors of war, we can never sufficiently value the inestimable blessing of peace. Apathy, with respect to deliverances experienced, borders too much on insensibility: It is our duty frequently to recall to mind past times of difficulty and danger, and the signal mercies we have received, that we may be thankful for them, and be duly sensible of the different and happy circumstances in which we are placed. Happy change indeed; the storm of war is turned into the calm of peace; the lightnings cease to flash, the deep thunders to roll, the dark clouds are dissipated, and a bright day ensues: Peace with her balmy wings descends and drops her olive branch upon our coasts. Years of happiness and plenty have rolled on since our deliverance from civil bondage, and we have been long bask∣ing in the full sunshine of wordly prosperity, "<HI>sitting under our own vine and figtree, where there was none to disturb or make us afraid.</HI>" Bles∣sed with a climate temperate and salubrious, with a soil luxuriantly fertile, producing abundantly the necessaries, conveniencies and comforts of life, with an immense and well watered territory, "<HI>a land of brooks and fountains of water, whose stones are iron, and, like Palestine of old, flowing with milk and honey.</HI>" Add to these natural advantages, the civil and religious privileges we enjoy, and where is the nation under Heaven so highly favoured, that is made the subject of such numerous and precious blessings, and that is under greater obligations of gratitude to God.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> plan of confederation, formed in the moment of danger, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> superficial and imperfect to remain when that was past. A new con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tution, therefore, became absolutely necessary to preserve and perpetuate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne blessings we had obtained by our independence; to regulate, balance and define the powers of government, in such a manner, as to secure the rights, liberty and happiness of the people; and to concentrate the whole force of the union for internal and external defence. These important ends are happily attained under our present form of government, which employed for a considerable time the ablest statesmen of our country; which in its structure affords a display of wisdom and talents, unequalled perhaps in any nation, and which is the admiration of the most enlight∣ened politicians in the world.</P>
<P>Perhaps a more difficult and weighty task cannot be undertaken, than to contrive a plan of republican government to suit the political genius and principles of a nation; to give the people their due share in its admi∣nistration; to establish its various branches, so that they shall be suffici∣ently extensive to include, direct and superintend all their essential politi∣cal interests, and to balance and limit the different departments▪ in such a manner, that they shall not clash, or one interfere with or assume the province of another. In ours, the powers are so defined, the departments are so circumscribed, and the checks so strong and properly disposed, as to answer these valuable purposes as far, perhaps, as human wisdom can ef∣fect; and to complete its merit, provides a remedy for its own defects.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, highly to value this excellent constitution, which is the safety, happiness and glory of our country; and we should stand by and defend this palladium of our liberty and independence, against all the attacks of internal or external foes. Indeed it must be gross ignorance and stupidity, or a deliberate and wicked intention, to oppose the prospe∣rity and happiness of America, which excites any to slander or defame our government or its administration; for they are both the choice of the people; they are both endeared to us by experience and trial; they are both sanctioned and ratified by the express, the avowed, the public and repeated declarations of a great majority of the most wise, enlightened and patriotic legislatures, as well as individuals, throughout the Union. It is enough, then, to excite indignation in the breast of every true friend to his country, to see men professing a great concern for its welfare, who at the same time endeavour to promote disaffection to the government and its administration; and under the sacred garb of patriotism, like political assassins, conceal a dagger to plunge into its very vitals. <HI>O Washington!</HI> thy country's hero, glory and defence▪ Could not thy long tried services, thy hard earned laurels, thy disinterested patriotism, thy noble talents, thy distinguished virtues, which compelled even envious Europe to confer on thee the palm, could they not secure even thee from those shafts of malice, when, like a skillful pilot, thou didst direct the helm of state, and brought us safely through the storm, in spite of threatening rocks and quicksands?

But as Washington thy predecessor, so n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither hast thou escaped the tongue of envy and detraction; and like him, resplen∣dent in thy virtues, thou mayest defy the malice of these puny enemies, and laugh at their scorn; for <HI>their censure</HI> is <HI>thy highest praise</HI>; while genius, talents, integrity and love of country continue to be objects of esteem, thy name shall be enrolled among the foremost of thy country's worthies. A constitution like this, administered by men of such splendid virtues and talents, can never fail to command the attachment, venera∣tion and support of every judicious and enlightened mind, of all the friends of liberty, order and good government. And how great must our happiness in this respect appear, if we contrast it with the present French administration, and the situation of civil government in France; where men of the most abandoned character, the most ignorant and un∣principled wretches, taken from the very dregs of the people, and noted for the most diabolical cruelty, wickedness, dissipation, treachery and in∣trigue, have often been entrusted with the offices of government, and have exercised a tyranny that beggars all description. If to this we add the ease with which this great event, a change of constitution, has been effected among us, without civil broil or bloodshed, notwithstanding the great variety of opposite opinions and clashing interests, which must be concerned in such an extensive territory: If we also consider that a simi∣lar change in France, has been the occasion of the most dreadful civil wars and scenes of more than savage cruelties and slaughter; has over∣turned the very foundations of civil and religious society, broke through all the bonds of moral obligation, and instead of a mild republican govern∣ment, as their professed object was, they have established a military des∣potism, ten thousand times worse than the arbitrary monarchy which they destroyed, and have exchanged <HI>one</HI> for <HI>many</HI> tyrants! If we consider these things, and compare them with our own situation, it must appear even to the most thoughtless observer, that we are indeed a happy people; that the hand of the Lord has been with us for good in a way of dis∣tinguished mercy, and that we are under indispensable obligations to gra∣titude and praise.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> On this day it is proper also to consider the designs that have been formed against our independence, and the attempts that have been made to overturn our civil and religious privileges.</P>
<P>Strange, indeed it must appear, that such designs should be formed by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="035561_0009_1005F31D15CA81A8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us in our struggle for liberty; who here became animated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> flame; who still profess to be engaged in the same glorious cause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are evidently endeavouring and determined to overturn liberty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rights of man, and to establish a new species of improved tyranny, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>roughout the world. But this proves, no doubt, the falsity of their professions, and pretended views; proves that the pinnacle of liberty is too elevated for them, and has turned their brain; indicates that their genius is too volatile and fluctuating for a republic; shews that their de∣sign is changed, that they have abandoned the cause in which they first set out; and instead of establishing their own and other nations' liberties, as they pretend their object is, this is only the cloak with which they cover their more favourite and selfish, though dark and horrid design of universal plunder and domination. As to religion, it is evident, that the most daring and artful designs have been formed to exterminate it, if pos∣sible, from the face of the earth. A number of disorganizing, dissipated and licentious characters, headed by the leading infidel and atheistical philo∣sophers of France and Germany, have for a long time been engaged in it, and with astonishing success. By means of secret societies, combined in the same common but inglorious cause; trained to impiety, insensibility and licentiousness, and bound to secrecy by the most awful oaths and dreadful penalties; an extensive combination of persons and means has been formed against God and his kingdom; against all religion natural and revealed; and against all existing governments. The revolution in France has afforded an opportunity for this wicked fraternity to carry on their base designs: For the men who have been at the head of the go∣vernment, and have had the principal direction of revolutionary transac∣tions, have generally, if not universally been members of it: And they have employed their power, influence and authority, in promoting the horrid plan of destroying religion, and revolutionizing the world. The French rulers have frequently made the most artful, flattering and specious professions, that their design was to promote the cause of liberty, to des∣troy tyranny and superstition, and to free the nations from oppression; but at the same time they have endeavoured to bring them to a state of the most abject slavery, oppressive tyranny and complicated misery. By destroying the bonds of moral obligation; by promoting a spirit of dis∣content, suspicion and disaffection to civil government; they introduce the most un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded licentiousness and wickedness, destroy all subordi∣nation, overturn the foundations of civil and religious society, and total∣ly subvert social order and human happiness.</P>
<P>The policy of France has been to divide people from their governments; thus to weaken the strength of nations by civil dissention and party spirit, and pave the way for an easy conquest to themselves. This has been their inva∣riable conduct; and it has proved but too successful with respect to many nations whom they have subjugated, and whose melancholy fate affords an awful warning to others, to shun this dangerous snare. That they have had the same ensnaring views and insidious designs with respect to us, is a truth too glaring now to be denied: For this purpose they have estab∣lished these secret societies in America, and have influenced a number of our fellow-citizens to espouse their cause, and form a party in their fa∣vour; who, in conjunction with our foreign enemies, have endeavoured to

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>arrass our government; to promote disaffection and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ecutive; to obstruct and defeat its measures; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> subtle and fatal political poison of jealousy, calumny, reproach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> content, in order to blast in the bud, the fair prospect of American <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and happiness. O love of country! which doth pervade the breast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Laplander, in Frozen, and of Hottentot, in Torrid Zone: Ah! whi∣ther art thou fled from <HI>us,</HI> in this mild region of the globe; that those who are nourished and supported in this land of plenty, and favoured with its choicest blessings, should turn against their country, and basely join a foreign foe, like cruel vultures, to prey upon its vitals! Though it is evident that such a party has been formed among us; though the de∣signs of the French rulers, were obviously hostile and threatening to our government, peace, liberty and independence as a nation; yet so wilful∣ly blind and infatuated were many, that they would not believe that their views were unfriendly, or that our liberties were in danger, except from the misconduct and ambition of our own rulers. Though, by their ambas∣sadors, they had frequently insulted our goverment, and endeavoured to prejudice and excite the people to opposition against it; though they claim∣ed, and strove to exercise powers derogatory to our sovereignty; though in violation of the faith of treaties, and the known law of nations, they plundered our defenceless commerce; though they refused to receive our minister, treated him with insult, and ordered him out of their territory; and though they would not acknowlege our envoys extraordinary, who were fully empowered to settle all existing differences; yet this torrent of evidence, for a long time, was insufficient to produce conviction in the minds of many: Numbers still remained attached to them and their cause; they harboured unreasonable suspicions against our government, and its executive; they exerted themselves with such resolution, vigour and union, and in such a variety of ways, as to obstruct, retard and fre∣quently to render void, all energetic and defensive operations, and to produce the most paralizing and fatal opposition, to the wise, prudent and necessary measures taken by government, to secure us from the impend∣ing danger.</P>
<P>The publication of the dispatches from our envoys, and the President's▪ wise and ample instructions to them, turned the scale of prejudice against France; opened the eyes of all who were not wilfully blind; produced a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re general attachment to our own government, and disarmed opposition of its principal weapons against it. These publications plainly discover∣ed the base, intriguing, avaricious and treacherous designs of the French rulers, and the pacific and candid disposition of our own; that they had done every thing to promote peace and harmony, that was in their power, consistent with the honour, dignity and independence of the United States.</P>
<P>Thus the way was prepared for greater union among the people, as well as in our public councils; a majority in Congress was obtained in favour of vigorous and defensive measures, and the preparations for war, which had long been retarded, were commenced. Provision is now made, for erecting fortifications; for raising and disciplining troops; for obtaining a supply of cannon, arms, ammunition and warlike stores; for building and equipping a navy; and for the defence of our merchantmen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>

The President is authorized to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the country insidious and dangerous aliens; the naturaliza∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of foreigners is more carefully attended to; and a law has passed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nish those who exert themselves in stirring up sedition. Have we not therefore reason to bless God that, in the course of his Providence, so great a change has been wrought in the public mind, and that in conse∣quence of it, these wise and energetic measures have been taken, so conducive to our welfare, safety and defence: We have reason to thank him, that many have thus been brought to see things in a proper light; and that union, attachment to, and confidence in our go∣vernment, with a determined resolution to support its measures, have been the happy effects.</P>
<P>Another special reason we have for thankfulness is, that a way has been prepared by the faithless, plundering and daring conduct of France, for the dissolution of the treaty of alliance, by which we were connected with her, and on account of which we were subject to a variety of dif∣ficulties, and exposed to many dangers. The present moral and political state of France, under the despotic sway of men of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> licentious principles, and abandoned morals, using the most artful means to sow among the nations, the seeds of sedition, revolt and revolution; and en∣deavouring to subvert the christian religion, that in its stead they may promote the general spread of atheism, infidelity and profanity; renders it highly dangerous to have any political connection with that nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on: And indeed it is a melancholy truth, that our late intercourse with the French, and the inconsiderate and enthusiastic attachment of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> among us, to them and their cause, have already had a great influence a caus∣ing that awful spread of irreligion, infidelity, licentiousness, and disor∣ganizing principles and practices, already so visible in our country: And we may well take the warning given in the book of Revelations, "<HI>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye re∣ceive not of her plagues.</HI>" Our religious and spiritual concerns, therefore, as well as our political interests and independence, are greatly benefited by the dissolution of our connection with France; and we have reason to rejoice in this important event. Further, when we consider the part which the President has acted on this trying occasion; his penetration in discovering the insidious designs of our enemies, and his precautions in guarding against them; his great and distinguished abilities, for his high and important office; his wisdom, integrity, prudence and firmness, dis∣played on various occasions; we have abundant reason to be thankful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Supreme Disposer of all events, for raising up, and qualifying so emi∣nent a character, to fill this exalted station; and for overruling events in such a way, that he should be called by the public voice, to take the helm of government at this interesting and critical period. If to these things we add the appointment and acceptance of the illustrious and beloved Wash∣ington, to the command of our armies, at this important crisis, the de∣tail of our country's prosperity seems complete; and we are made to re∣joice, equally, at our own happiness, and at the exalted height to which his condescension, in this respect, has raised his fame.</P>
<P><PB REF="035561_0012_1005F325ECCF2548"/>Can we then sincerely view the great events which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us; can we contemplate the inestimable worth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>religious liberty,</HI> advantages and privileges, and consider how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> preservation and enjoyment of <HI>these,</HI> depend on the preservation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> civil liberty and political independence; can we think of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> designs now carrying on for the overthrowing all religion, and reducing the nations under the sovereign controul of one despotic, arbitrary go∣vernment, headed by a set of wicked and abandoned infidels; can we then turn our minds to the great and interesting change, which has taken place, in the public mind and measures here, and those things which have led to it, <HI>by which</HI> we are enabled to guard against, and resist their base and treacherous designs; can we deliberately contemplate these and other things which have been brought to our remembrance, this day, without a deep and thorough conviction, that God hath indeed wrought wonderfully for us; without seeing and acknowledging his unsearchable wisdom and goodness, his great and distinguished mercy towards us, and feeling ourselves impelled to render him sincere and fervent praise.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed briefly, to point out some of the duties, which naturally result from a recollection of these events.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> Gratitude to God, the author of all our mercies, is a duty essen∣tially necessary, and highly incumbent upon us: "<HI>For by strength of hand,</HI> says the text, <HI>the Lord brought you out from this place.</HI>" And it is the Lord alone that brings us out of all our difficulties; that defends us from the snares of our enemies, and provides a way for us to escape out of their hands; he cuts the bars of brass asunder, opens the prison doors, and sets the weary captive free: And when we consider the many and great deliverances we have experienced; the number and power of our enemies; the many stratagems, and insidious designs that have been formed against us, our own weakness and helplessness, the apparent im∣possibility, at times, of being able to extricate ourselves from the laba∣rynth which enclosed us; we may truly say, "<HI>by strength of hand the Lord brought us out of our troubles, and delivered us from the power of our enemies, even by his Almighty and out stretched arm.</HI>" Where is the nation on the globe that is more prosperous and more happy, more fa∣voured in its political and civil institutions, more blessed with temporal as well as spiritual privileges. We should, therefore, frequently recol∣lect the numerous and distinguished mercies, which the Lord has confer∣red upon us, and endeavour to be truly thankful for them. We should also recollect the many and aggravated sins we have committed in the face of these mercies; for ingratitude and abuse of God's goodness, disobedience, profanity, idolatry, dissipation and infidelity too much abound. It is our duty then to be truly humble on their account; and the goodness of God which we have so remarkably experienced, should have a tendency to lead us to repentance, and a suitable improvement of his mercies: In this way our land would become Emanuels, where he would delight to dwell; God would be in the midst of us for good; would be our strong tower and rock of defence, a wall of fire round about us, to preserve us from all our enemies, and he would cause that no weapon formed against us should prosper.</P>
<P><PB REF="035561_0013_1005F32197A16870"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> duty at this period highly necessary, is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to promote union among ourselves, and attachment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Our blessed Saviour declares, and daily experience evince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the declaration, that "<HI>a house, or a kingdom divided against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot stand:</HI>" It is impossible in the very nature of things. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been verified in the fate of all the that France has lately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Venice, Genoa, Sardinia, Geneva, Holland, Switzerland—all have fallen and perished in the fatal snare; distrusting and suspecting the views of their own governments, and confiding in the fair and deceitful promises of the French, they became divided among themselves, and thus all possibility and hope of union for defence being taken away, they be∣came an easy prey to their enemies. This seems to be the main object and principal design of the French, to promote division and party spirit, among the people, and to wean their affections from their government: If they can succeed in this, their triumph is complete, the walls of defence are thrown down, and invasion immediately ensues. This they tried in America; and though defeated in the end, yet for a while were so success∣ful as greatly to retard defensive measures, and to clog the wheels of go∣vernment. Let us then f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmly believe this important and eternal truth, that if we are united we may stand, but divided we must fall; and let it produce its full conviction in our minds and upon our conduct. Govern∣ment is the great bond of union to a people: If we distrust it, and place no confidence in it, all is lost; there is no centre of union, information, or of action; no plan of safety, no measures of defence. Let us then cultivate affection and esteem for the government of our choice, and place the utmost confidence in it. If any thing be wrong, as no human system is perfect, and time frequently discovers errors, let us not despise and reject it, on that account; but use the means prescribed for a constitutional reform. As republicans we ought to have wisdom, virtue and good sense enough, to know and feel that the majority must govern; that the ru∣lers whom we have chosen, and they only, must direct our public affairs; and that if their views and measures are not conformable to our judg∣ments, we are more likely to be wrong than they, who are at the source of information, and have a combination of facts and circumstances, to influence their decisions, which to us are often out of sight. Let us strive to cultivate knowledge, that we may have enlarged views of our political concerns, and discern where our true interests lie. Let us beware of ig∣norance, the disgrace of human nature, the enemy of civil society, and the ruin of republics. It is because we are ignorant of our political du∣ties, of the nature and excellence of the civil institutions that we enjoy, that we undervalue, and disregard them, and do not give them our ut∣most support. It is because we have too little of that virtue, which is the principle and spring of our government, that many are so unreasonably difficult, absurdly censorious, suspicious and seditious; so very backward to exert themselves in their country's service. Let us then endeavour to conform our disposition, sentiments and conduct to the genius of that form of government which we have chosen; let us cultivate republican principles, manners and habits, and make our country's welfare, the chief object of our pursuit; and let us banish these mean, unfounded suspicions and jealousies, which are the effects, too frequently, of criminal and wilful ignorance, of prejudice, envy or a levelling disposition, and which constitute
<PB REF="035561_0014_1005F345CE9B5588"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our political happiness: Let us, in find, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urselves, attached to our government, vigorous and active <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> measures and laws; and we need fear neither the intriguing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he arms of the most powerful nation upon earth.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> Another duty to which we are called by the recollection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> events laid before us this day, is, a determined resolution to defend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liberty and independence.</P>
<P>These, we see, have been attacked at different times, and in various ways; the most artful plans have been laid to ensnare, and divide, in order to conquer and subjugate us; and even a number of our fellow-ci∣tizens have been led to turn against the country which gave them birth, and to join a base, insidious foe. This shews the necessity we have to be constantly on our guard, and resolutely determined to defend our country, when occasion requires, both with our fortunes and our lives. Have they not already threatened, that we shall share the fate of Venice and Genoa, if we do not comply with their insolent, arbitrary and unjust demands. And shall we tamely sit upon our lees, and see our country plundered by these daring enemies of God and man? Shall we begrudge a part of our property, to defend the whole, or repine at the expense? Or shall we save it to reward the French, for the mild blessings of their better government, to pay their soldiers for conquering our country, for burning our villages and towns, for butchering our patriots, for plundering our houses, for desolating our farms, for violating our females, for destroying every vestage of that holy religion, which is our only hope. What bet∣ter purpose then can our property answer, than to save us from these bar∣barous, horrid scenes; and why do any complain of taxes imposed for our defence against them? Shall we be backward even to venture our lives in such a cause? It will be desirable, it will be honourable, it will be glo∣rious, to fall in the defence of our country, of our liberty, of our religi∣on, of our property, families, wives and children. In this struggle we contend for all that is worth preserving, for all that is dear to man, and without which life itself must be a burden! We contend that our inde∣pendence, rights and privileges, civil and religious, may descend to our children, that they may have these precious blessings handed down, pure and entire from us, and may be preserved from that system of civil and religious disorganization, which is the disgrace and ruin of human nature.</P>
<P>Let us then animate ourselves, to a defence of our independence, on this day, sacred to its memory, by considering what it cost us. The years of anxiety and toil, the arduous and painful exertions; the scenes of plunder, desolation and burning; of misery and woe; of destruction and carnage; how much blood and treasure, how many precious and invalua∣ble lives; here an affectionate father, there a dutiful and promising son, here a fond brother, there a near relative or friend! Can you contemplate this scene of suffering, and not be affected with it; can you consider these costly sacrifices, made to secure your liberties, and feel unconcerned or indifferent about them, feel willing to resign them even without a struggle to such sacrilegious, daring and insulting enemies? Certainly no; you will not so disgrace your country: <HI>I see</HI> a brightg <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

I see the flame of liberty rising in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; a martial ardour animates your frame; you glow with courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> country's cause; you grasp with eagerness the standard of free∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, and with sword in hand declare you will never resign it but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath; you'll make a rampart of your bodies to defend your country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with her expiring liberty you'll perish! Glorious resolution, worthy of the sons of freedom. Prepare then to march with boldness, when your country calls; prepare to guard her injured and invaded rights; and if in her defence you take the field, may the God of armies shield you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of battle, give you the victory, and scatter your enemies before you.</P>
<P>To the protection of the Eternal, we commit our country and her cause. The same Almighty arm that once appeared for our relief, that con∣ducted our forefathers to this American wilderness, which he has made to blossom like the rose, is still able to defend our rights, our liberty and our religion, against the bold despisers of his name, his word and wor∣ship; and he will not suffer them long to triumph with impunity; "<HI>For the day of their calamity is at hand, if not already begun, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</HI>" Our trust then is not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and in horses, but in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlasting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
