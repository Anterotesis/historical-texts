<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Ensuing Word is the Lords, is Mine, is Yours, and is to be lookt at as a Message from the Lord, by me, to your selves, (to your selves I say, nextly and immediately, yet not so restrictively, but that all others in like capacity with your selves; yea all <HI>Christian Rea∣ders</HI> into whose hands it shall come, may look at themselves as concerned therein)</P>
<P>It is the Lords as part of his Counsel, Mind and Will: some of the great things of Gods Law lately Preached, now written to you.</P>
<P>It is mine, as an Instrument (however unworthy) in the composing, then dis∣pensing, now publishing of the same.</P>
<P>It is yours, as I was called by you to this work, a Servant to you therein, and as by this presentation it is now made more especially yours.</P>
<P>As the Lords▪ you are most solemnly Commanded; as mine, most humbly in∣treated; as your own, strongly obliged to peruse, understand, receive and pra∣ctise what is here sent you.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> could not think any thing of mine worthy of the publick view; but seeing your selves thought otherwise, and others, whom I honour and reverence were like minded with your selves; I thought meet to submit to persons of better judgements. And therefore have permitted it to pass the Press, being not able to be inexe∣rable to the Importunity of my Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor daring to be disobedient to the Com∣mands of my Superiours, and the desires of Superiours (in Case, and in this Case) I account Commands.</P>
<P>The Lord expected that all the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> should contribute something toward the <HI>building of the Tabernacle;</HI> and that none might plead Poverty as an Argument for their Exemption, ordered their bringing and pro∣mised his accepting of <HI>Goats Hair</HI> and <HI>Brass,</HI> as well as <HI>silk and silver, Chittim Wood</HI> as well as <HI>precious Stones, (see</HI> Exod. 25.1—8) <HI>I</HI> was thence encoura∣ged to bring my Oblation, when called for, of what was under my Hand. He that ha's received but one Talent must lay it out, not wrap it up. The Lord is no hard Master, he accepts according to what a man ha's, not what he hath not, <HI>(2 Cor. 8.12.)</HI> and men should do the like. If what is here done may (though but in the least degree) promote the work of the Lords house among you, or else∣where, I shall attain my End, and be abundantly rewarded for my Labour.</P>

<HEAD>1 COR. 9.26. So Fight I, not as one that beats the Air.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is commonly and not inconveniently said, that a Mans general and particular Calling are the two Legs on which he Travels through the Wilderness of this World, from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> he that fail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in either of them will prove a lame Christian, he may happily hop or creep, but will not be able to go uprightly, much less will he run the Race that is set before him so as to obtain. To use both these Legge, and yet to set the best Legg foremost, I mean his <HI>General Calling,</HI> and to make the other, <HI>viz,</HI> that of his <HI>Part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cular</HI> subservient to his <HI>General,</HI> is the <HI>Duty</HI> of every one that will be and appear to be a Christian indeed. But so to do, we may say of it, <HI>this is a labour, this is a work.</HI> Oh how hard is it for these not to Interfere one upon another, and Interfereing how dange∣rous, how pernicious! And the more, because the <HI>General Calling,</HI> and so the <HI>One thing necessary</HI> usually comes by the worst of it. <HI>The many things</HI> do so <HI>clamorously</HI> and <HI>cogently</HI> call for <HI>Attendance,</HI> and we are so ready to be at their Beck when they call, that it is many to one, if <HI>the one thing</HI> be not neglected and overlookt by means of <HI>the many.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent this, besides the <HI>Cautious, Counsels, Warnings, Commands, Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> that the Scripture is full of, to make us look to the <HI>main chance,</HI> to mind the great business that is before us: I say besides all these means, the Lord takes care to make us spiritual in all our Imployments, by spiritualizing all our Imployments. Yea, all our Relations and Condi∣tions as well as Imployments, are so improved to our Hands by the Spirit of God in his Word as that they may be useful both as <HI>Monitors</HI> and <HI>Help∣ers</HI> to mind us of, and further us in those matters that are of most solemn and momentous, because of Eternal Concernment. Thus our hungring, thirsting, eating, drinking▪ sleeping, wakeing, walking, sitting, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, resting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus the Relations of Husband, Wife, Parents, Children, Masters, Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are particularly mentioned as full of precious and practical Instructions.</P>
<P>Thus our Call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs, Functions, or Occupations, whether mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e liberal or <HI>Mecha∣nick</HI>▪ each of them bears twins, and there is none barren among them. The Les∣ons the God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> teaching us out of our proper Vocations are so many, so spiri∣tual, &amp; so pertinent, that they are enough to leave us without excuse, if we are

not spiritual in them, and learn not to be more spiritual whiles about them. To give a Tast in a few Instnaces.</P>
<P>The Physitian and Chirurgion when visiting or administring to the sick or lame, giving <HI>Purges, Cordials,</HI> &amp;c. setting bones, applying Plaisters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be minded of his own Condition by nature, convinced of his need of Christ, directed to apply himself to Him, as the <HI>great Physitian, Soul-Physiti∣an,</HI> who is <HI>anointed and appointed by the Father to bind up, heal, recover,</HI> yea to do that which is out of the reach of all Physick, <HI>viz. to quicken the dead,</HI> Joh. 5.25. see also <HI>Hos. 6.1, 22. Psal. 146.8.</HI> and <HI>147.3. Jer. 8.22 Mal. 4.2. Luk. 4.18. Psal.</HI> 51.8.</P>
<P>The Merchant is advised among all his dealing and trading in the world, to act the part of that wise Merchant, <HI>by selling all for the Pearl,</HI> which will be the best, and should be the first bargain he makes, <HI>Math. 13.45, 46.</HI> And he is assured by Christ <HI>the wisdome of the Father,</HI> that he can deal in no Commodities that will yield him like Profit, <HI>Prov. 8.11, 18, 21.</HI> but what ever else he may get, if he neglect this, will come to a bad market at last.</P>
<P>The Factour that is imployed by others, having an estate of theirs to ma∣nage to whom he must give an Account; His very calling minds him of his Relation to God the <HI>High Possessor of Heaven and Earth,</HI> from whom he ha's those daily Consignments of Life, Health, Food, Raiment, Gospel, and all the precious things thereof, of all which great Betrustments he must one day give an Account to his Principal, and woe to him, if through his Sloth, pro∣fuseness, or otherwise he disenables himself from rendring to his Owner his Own with Advantage. Indeed we are all <HI>Stewards</HI> of the <HI>manifold Grace of God,</HI> (1 Pet. 4.10.) And that Text, that awful Text should lye down and rise up with us, and keep upon our hearts all the day long, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.2. <HI>Give an Account of thy Stewardship, for thou maiest be no longer Steward.</HI></P>
<P>The Husbandman should own God in that wisdom he teaches him about his Calling, <HI>Isai. 28.24, 29.</HI> and know that himself is <HI>Gods Husbandry,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. and that therefore he ought to be so towards God as he expects his Land to be towards him after all the costly and expensive Husbandry that he hath been the Subject of, <HI>Isai. 5.1</HI>—4. The dealing of Husbandmen is much in Earth, and lest they should lose and bury up their Souls alive there∣in, and so miss Heaven, God hath put a great deal of Heaven into their Earth and there they may find it, their fencing, clearing, plowing, sowing, weeding, plucking up the thorns, waiting for the <HI>former and latter rain,</HI> reaping, gathering into the Barn, threshing, winnowing, are all made in Scripture similitudes, and so teachers of Heavenly things, see <HI>Math. 13.3—9.</HI> and <HI>ver.</HI> 18—23. with <HI>ver.</HI> 24, 25. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Math. 3.10, 12.</P>
<P>The Fisherman if he will read, <HI>Math.</HI> 13.47. may thence learn to catch <HI>the Kingdome of Heaven</HI> in his Net, and some spiritual Good with his

Hook and Line. And it is observable that in <HI>ver.</HI> 52. of that Chapter: he be-speaks his Disciples as persons well instructed unto the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> by means of those similitudes which out of their Secular Affairs and ordinary Imployments he had borrowed and suited to their Use.</P>
<P>It would be endless to particularize, for even from the King upon the Throne to the Hewer of wood and drawer of water, the Lord is in his word teaching us by such familiar and known <HI>Metaphore</HI> taken from those Cal∣lings that we are versed in, in so much that all sorts of men may say concern∣ing the voice of God in his word, as they in another Case. <HI>Act. 2 8, 11.</HI> How is it that we hear from thence in our own Tongue wherein we were born, and in the proper <HI>dialect</HI> of those Imployments to which we have been bred, the wonderful Counsels of God declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o us! the Lords manner of speaking as it helps us to the understanding of what he saith, so his love and Care therein should quicken us to the practise of what we understand. They that would see more of this may consult these and such like Scriptures, <HI>Joh. 15.1, 2, 5, 7. Math. 9 16, 17.</HI> and <HI>19.24. Luk. 12:19, 20, 21. Jer. 18.1—4,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>confer</HI> Rom. 9.21 Psal. 2 9. Math. 7.24. <HI>&amp;c</HI>:</P>
<P>But to avoid any further skirmishing at a distance, and to come to a more close Engagement with my Text, in which the Calling or Profession of the Souldier is made use of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Instructive to the Christian.</P>
<P>My work this day principally is to attend a Call from, and so to speak something to Souldiers, and I knov no better way to speak to their Under∣standings and Hearts then to speak in their own <HI>Dialect</HI>▪ to treat them not only as Christians but also as Souldiers, or as <HI>Christian Souldiers.</HI> And there∣fore my discourse shall be a <HI>Divinity-Lecture</HI> to such, <HI>i. e. Military-Divinity</HI> or <HI>Divine Souldiery,</HI> for the doing of which my Text advantageth me, as ha∣ving in it the great wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of a Christian in <HI>working out his Salvation,</HI> set forth under the <HI>Meta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor</HI> of <HI>fighting,</HI> and the manner of doing that, by the manner of doing this, [<HI>So fight I</HI>]</P>
<P>I might give you the <HI>Coherence</HI> of the <HI>Text</HI> with the former part of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> and of that with the latter part of the foregoing <HI>Chapter,</HI> which for brevity sake I omit.</P>
<P>It may suffice to say, that having exhorted them to <HI>run the Race that is set before them,</HI> and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged his Exhortation from the Example of other <HI>Run∣ners,</HI> and <HI>Strivers</HI> or <HI>Wrestlers,</HI> who were careful and intense in their way, though the Argument or Motive to urge them thereto were small and incon∣siderable compared with theirs. The one being a <HI>Corruptible,</HI> the other an <HI>In∣corruptible Crown.</HI> He doth now in <HI>ver.</HI> 26. reinforce his Exhortation to them by the proposal of his own Example before them, and that under a <HI>double Metaphor.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Of Running,</HI> concerning which he speaks▪</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="000193_0007_0FA316F706892050"/>1. Affirmatively, <HI>I so Run.</HI> 2. Negatively, <HI>not as uncertainly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Of fighting,</HI> which is before us in the words read, where the Apostle presents himself in the <HI>Equipage</HI> of a <HI>Souldier,</HI> whose Business is <HI>Fighting,</HI> amplified from the manner of his doing it, [<HI>So fight I</HI>] and <HI>how,</HI> he sets down in the Text, Negatively, [<HI>not as one that beats the Air</HI>] In the Con∣text Affirmatively, [<HI>I keep under my Body,</HI> &amp;c.] Together with the Reason o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whole [<HI>Lest while I preach to others, I my self should be a cast away.</HI>]</P>

<P><HI>Fight I</HI>] The Greek word here rendred [<HI>Fight I</HI>] is by the Latine <HI>pugi∣lem ago,</HI> which most properly notes to fight with the fist. <HI>Pugil</HI> from <HI>pug∣na</HI>; and that from <HI>pugnu</HI> the Fist, though we use <HI>pugna</HI> for any manner of Fighting, for a battel or Skirmish where Swords and other Weapons are used; and so <HI>Pugil</HI> is rendred a <HI>Champion</HI> or <HI>streng Fighter. [Fight I]</HI> then may be, I act the part of a <HI>Champion,</HI> Now a <HI>Champion</HI> is supposed to be not only a <HI>Souldier,</HI> but one <HI>singularly qualified</HI> and <HI>eminently accomplisht</HI> for what he undertakes, one that is both <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Skilful.</HI> Hence <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Go∣liah</HI> was called the <HI>Philistines Champion</HI>; 1 Sam. 17 23, 51. So that to <HI>Fight</HI> like a <HI>Champion</HI> means to <HI>Fight</HI> like an <HI>able, Skilful, Active man,</HI> a man of whose <HI>Fighting</HI> well, there is <HI>Great Expectation,</HI> and upon whose so doing there is no <HI>small dependance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not as one that beats the Air</HI>] A very <HI>significant Expression</HI> borrowed from those that make a Flourish with their Weapon, make a shew of doing much, whereas all they do is but a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er shew, an empty show; they draw the Sword and wave it too and fro, but hit nothing besides <HI>Air</HI> with it. This same Apostle hath a <HI>Parallel Expression</HI> that will give some light to this, <HI>1 Cor. 14.9.</HI> He that speaks <HI>unintell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gible</HI> words, he speaks in the <HI>Air,</HI> i. e. he speaks <HI>insignificantly</HI> and <HI>unprofitably</HI> to his Hearers, whose Ears may have the Sound, but themselves not having the Sense of what he speaks, his words <HI>fly into the Air,</HI> i. e. are to no purpose. He makes a <HI>Great Sound</HI> with his high and hard words, but they are <HI>Airy,</HI> there is nothing in them to the Hea∣rers. So here; some mens Actions are as empty as other mens words, no∣thing but a <HI>Flourish</HI> in the <HI>Air.</HI> This Phrase may be answered by the Latine <HI>Ventilare,</HI> which (besides other significations) meaneth only to <HI>Flourish.</HI> The Poet speaking of one that was but a <HI>Flash, a Bubble, a Vapour,</HI> saith of him, he spreads abroad his Arms indeed, makes a shew, pretends to some∣thing, but <HI>verberat istibus Anras,</HI> He strikes nothing but Air with his Blows. Many will so do, speak big, and look high, make a very fair <HI>Flouris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with their Swords, wave their Weapons too and fro, carry them over their Heads, and round about them very neatly and dexterously, so that they appear very <HI>Skilful, able</HI> and <HI>valiant men,</HI> that can dare and do much; but this is
<PB N="5" REF="000193_0008_0FA316F7C7A369F0"/>
only while there is nothing but Air before them, upon which they may strike while they will without any danger of being stricken again, such may pass for fair Flourishers, but are no Fighters. It is not so with me (saith <HI>Paul</HI>) I have something before me besides Air, and therefore have other work to do then to beat <HI>That.</HI> I have an Enemy before me which I must strike, and strike down too, and that at my utmost peril.</P>
<P>The Summe is, he commends to them by his own Example, Fighting for their work and Imployment, and by his Negation of <HI>beating the Air</HI> only, he implies and intends the Contrary Affirmative, <HI>viz</HI> that he was thorough, intense and in good earnest about his work, he did not make a show only, then he did do the thing, there was not an outside, an appearance only, then there was the substance, the reality, and as he did, they ought to do also. Hence take up this plain Doctrine.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>To be in the Equipage or Capacity, and to perform the work of a Soul∣dier, and that vigorous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, stoutly, strongly, strenuously, is the Duty incumbent upon every Christian.</HI> The Calling and Imployment of a Souldier is that also of a Christian, in which he is to acquit himself strenuously and like a man. He that will be a Christian indeed must be a Christian Souldier and that in deed, in reality, not in show or appearance, he must fight not flourish only, be a Souldier and that in actual Service too, [<HI>So Fight I</HI>] in the pre∣sent Tense, fighting is with every Christian alwayes in the Present Tense. A Christian must engage in a spiritual warfare, and therein he must not be like <HI>one that beats the Air.</HI> No, but he must act the part or do the work of a Souldier, and that in good earnest. He must not be the picture of a Soul∣dier, a Fencer, a Stage-player, one that comes on the Stage and for pleasure, sport or in jest only personates a Souldier, when he really is, and means no∣thing less, but he must buckle to the Business of Fighting like a man that aims to make work of it. In a word, we need not alter the Terms of the Text. It is the Duty of every Christian to look at and carry himself as a Souldier in the Fight, wherein he is to behave or demean himself not like <HI>one that beats the Air.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine hath two parts in it, The one, the calling or Imployment of a Christian, <HI>viz.</HI> he is to Fight, the other contains the manner of his doing it, not slightily, but Substantially, not in jest, but in good earnest.</P>
<P>I shall draw forth each part by it self, and speak to each singly by way of Explication and Confirmation, and then make some Application of both to∣gether.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The first Part of the Doctrine.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Christian must be a Souldier.</HI> That which I mean by it is that there is a great Harmony, Likeness, or Similitude between the work of a Souldier and

that of a Christian. The A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Souldiery doth fitly resemble the Art of Christianity, and may be profitably improved to set forth the Nature thereof.</P>
<P>That this is so, and wherein it is so, will appear if we Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Spirit of God often puts the Name of Souldiers upon Chri∣stians, and be-speaks them in Terms borrowed from that Profession: the Saints also have familiarly professed or confessed themselves to be such. See <HI>2 Tim. 2.3, 4▪</HI> and <HI>4 7. 1 Tim. 6.12.</HI> and <HI>1.18.</HI> So <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>Archip∣pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his fellow Souldier,</HI> Philem 2. and that not only as a preacher of the Gospel, but as a Christian. Hence we commonly and Scripturally call the Church on Earth, the <HI>Church-Militant,</HI> i. e the <HI>warring</HI> or <HI>warfaring-Church,</HI> the <HI>Army</HI> or <HI>fighting Company,</HI> So <HI>Cant. 3.7, 8.</HI> and <HI>6.4, 10, 11.</HI> There are two parts of the Church of Christ, (answerable to the two pla∣ces where they are, or States wherein they are, <HI>Earth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Heaven, Grace and Glory</HI>) viz. that which is <HI>Militant,</HI> and that which is <HI>Triumphant,</HI> that which is yet warring, and that which is now in <HI>Triumph</HI> after the end of the Warr, wherein they have been <HI>Victorious,</HI> and their being <HI>Trium∣phant</HI> hereafter, speaks them <HI>Militant</HI> now.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Qualifications or Indowments of Christians are such as are the <HI>Characteristical Notes</HI> or <HI>Badges</HI> of <HI>good Souldiers</HI>; the same Excellencies that speak a Souldier, spiritualized make a Christian too. Take those Ac∣complishments which are requisite in a Souldier, and he that ha's them (taken I mean in a spiritual Sense) is a Christian also. Counsel and strength are for the war, whether Literal or Spiritual, <HI>Isai. 36.</HI>5. Skill, will, Strength, Activity, Valour, Courage, compleat a man for either Imployment. Un∣derstanding to know his weapons, and skill to use them, prudence and wis∣dom in taking the right means and Season, Strength to undergo what is pro∣pounded, and Courage and Confidence to face and grapple with Difficul∣ties▪ not to be scared with words and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws, or frighted with false Fire, are necessary Qualifications for Souldiers and Christians, and for no Soul∣dier more then for a Christian Souldier, and in no <HI>warfare</HI> more then the <HI>Spiritual.</HI> Courage in special is Essentially needful to both. The Time∣ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cowardly or Fearful <HI>lead the Van</HI> of them that are sent to the <HI>Bottom∣less Pit,</HI> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.8.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we look into their <HI>Accoutrements</HI> as well as <HI>Accomplishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts,</HI> the Re∣semblanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s will further appear. A Believer fitted for Service and fixed for his Imployment, as such, is like a Sould<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er in the Field compleatly armed <HI>Cap a pe.</HI> You have the <HI>Christians Armory,</HI> Eph. 6 11—17. which suffici∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly proves his <HI>Souldiery.

If God provides, sends him and wills him to <HI>put on this Armor,</HI> you may readily conclude what Service he is to go upon. If the <HI>Lord of Hosts arrays him thus with Truth, Righteousness, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparation of the Gospel of Peace, puts hope on his Head, Faith in the one Hand, and the word in the other,</HI> and bids him thus stand, yea, and withal bids him to call these his <HI>Belt, Breast-plate, Head-piece, Sword and Shield,</HI> no wise man but will account such an one sufficiently mind∣ed of a <HI>warfare</HI> before him. God would never have called his <HI>Graces</HI> in the Believer and his word given to him, Arms and weapons, if his <HI>Calling</HI> had not been <HI>Military,</HI> and his work <HI>Fighting.</HI> If God bids men <HI>Arm,</HI> they may expect that the next word of <HI>Command</HI> will be <HI>Fall on,</HI> or else they will be by the Enemy <HI>fallen on,</HI> and so they must look to <HI>fall down.</HI> And this makes way for the next particular.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Christian must be a Souldier &amp; be in actual Service too, if we consider the multitude of Enemies that are about him to keep him doing. When God hath given a Christian his Armor, he will soon see those that will necessitate him to put it on and use it too. No sooner hath the Lord armed him, but the Enemy will alarm him, &amp; put <HI>his Armor to proof,</HI> whether it be <HI>Armor of Proof</HI> or no. He is no sooner converted but be set, Enemies surround him, assault him, so that he must either <HI>Fight</HI> or dye. The way to Heaven lies through the Enemies Country, and no getting through but by force of Arms. He must dispute every step at the <HI>Swords point.</HI> Heaven wust be won by the Sword e're i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be worn. Your <HI>Spiritual Enemies</HI> will do as they, <HI>Numb. 20.21, 22.</HI> not suffer you to pass through, but come out against you with a strong hand, and you must not turn away from them but <HI>Fight</HI> them as, <HI>Numb. 21.22, 24.</HI> The Lanes are filled, the Hedges lined with Enemies to impede your March <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aan ward,</HI> so that you must engage against them, or shamefully retreat and loose all. Then, He that ha's but what he wins by the Sword, gets no farther then he <HI>Fights,</HI> and holds, and keeps no more then what he keeps by the same means which he gets it by, sure this man is a <HI>Souldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> and such a life is a <HI>Souldiers life</HI>▪ But such is the Case of a Christian. <HI>Ergò.</HI></P>
<P>It would be endless to reckon up all his Enemies. Time would fail, should we only call over their Names and no more. But there be these four Heads which have thousands under them, <HI>viz. Sin, Self, Satan, World.</HI> I aim not at accurateness of distinction, (for I know that <HI>Self</HI> is Sin) but at tha familiar plainness which may be <HI>Intelligible</HI> unto all, and they are common¦ly so distinguished.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sin,</HI> which is in and about, and <HI>doth so easily be-set us,</HI> Heb. 12.1. and must be fought by those that will <HI>run the Race set before them,</HI> who must therefore <HI>Fight</HI> as well as <HI>Run.</HI> Sin I say, which on thy first coming to Christ thou must renounce▪ and wage warre with ever after. A warr and a
<PB N="8" REF="000193_0011_0FA316FA09666AF8"/>
bloudy warr too must be waged agaidst Sin, <HI>Heb, 12.4.</HI> You must be pro∣fessed Enemies to Sin, draw upon it where ever you meet it, keep it off at the <HI>Swords Point,</HI> stand upon your Guard, if it gets within you it kills you. Sin that <HI>deceitful thing that so often doth deceiv us</HI> under a Colour of being other then indeed it is. Sin that attends us in every Business, and lies in <HI>Ambush</HI> behind and in the midst of all our lawful Imployments, and while we are busy about them surprizes us at unawares. Sin that pretends in a friendly manner with <HI>Ioab to kiss thee,</HI> 2 Sam. 20.9, 20. but suddenly and unexpectedly <HI>wounds thee fatally.</HI> Now with Sin thou must not compound or make a Truce, but <HI>Fight</HI> it at all Times, do not spare Sin at any Time, for it will spare thee at no Time. It will mix it self with and mischief thee in eve∣ry Duty, Business, Imployment, when hearing, reading, praying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Do not trust it for it will deceive thee, and be against thee <HI>1 Sam. 29.4.</HI> To be ever at variance and in actual contest with Sin is our work, and therefore this of a Christian with Sin is rightly called, <HI>The Holy Warr.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Self,</HI> A close Enemy because within thee, and the more dangerous be∣cause so close. <HI>Of sinful self,</HI> that saying holds true, <HI>where shall one find a worse friend then one brings from home?</HI> An Enemy that lurks in thine own bosome, and thence is advantaged to do thee the more Harm. They are bad Enemies that are of <HI>a mans own House,</HI> worse that are of <HI>his own Heart.</HI> Against these thou must be ever watching, or else wilt be fooled and foiled by them. There is in thee an <HI>old Man, a Body of Sin, an Army of Lusts that are still warring against thy So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.11. Thou needest not <HI>beat the Air</HI> for want of an Enemy to strike. Thy Body thou must beat, yea, beat down, yea, <HI>keep down.</HI> There be <HI>strong Castles</HI> and <HI>high Towers</HI> within thee, <HI>2 Cor. 10.4, 5.</HI> that will never yield on Composition, but must be ta∣ken by Storm. Thou hast a <HI>Self</HI> that must be denied, subdued. A self that mixes itself with all thy Duties, concerns it self in all thy Businesses, yea, with all thy Graces. (As there is pride with Humility, yea, pride of Humility) Thy <HI>sinful self</HI> must be mortified, and yet still there remains a <HI>Righteous self,</HI> (as some Divines call it) that will do thee as much mischief as the other, <HI>Our own Righteousness</HI> is as great an Enemy to us as our <HI>Vn∣righteousness,</HI> our <HI>self Righteousness</HI> as dangerous as the other. <HI>Paul</HI> thought he had gained something by his exact walking in the <HI>Profession</HI> of a <HI>Phari∣see,</HI> having framed and stablished <HI>a Righteousness of his own,</HI> but he was fain to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all, deny that <HI>Self</HI> too, <HI>that he might w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Christ,</HI> Phil. 3.4, 9.</P>
<P>A Christian therefore must be a Souldier for he hath in him <HI>two contrary Principles,</HI> yea, <HI>two Armies</HI> engaged one against another, (<HI>Gal. 5.17,</HI>) lying one against another (as the Greek word imports) like <HI>two Armies</HI> lying intrenched one against the other, or like an Army <HI>beleaguering</HI> a City. There are <HI>fleshly lusts,</HI> actings, sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings on the one side; <HI>spiritual desires, mo∣tions</HI> tendencies on the other, each side contending for its contrary Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts
<PB N="9" REF="000193_0012_0FA316FAC6AD55D8"/>
and Ends. The Current of Natural Corruption runs downward, that of <HI>Supernatural grace</HI> moves upward. These two contrary streams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and hence there must needs be an actual Contest; one draws backward, the other forward, hence there must needs be a <HI>perpetual Warr.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Devil</HI> ha's a quarrel to thee, and <HI>Fight</HI> thee he will, and <HI>Fight</HI> him thou must. The first Cry of the <HI>New born Babe of Grace</HI> (saith a Divine) <HI>alarms all the Devils in Hell against him</HI>; what then shall he do if he can∣not <HI>Fight?</HI> He must not fly, (unto God indeed he may fly, but from the Devil he may not, must not fly,) nor must he yield, then he must <HI>Fight,</HI> stand his <HI>Ground, resist him stedfastly in the Faith,</HI> and so make him fly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pet. 5.9,</HI> with <HI>Jam. 4.7.</HI> Thou maiest and oughtest <HI>lift up thine eyes to the hills from whence comes thine help,</HI> dispatch Faith in Prayer for <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> from Heaven, but thou must <HI>Fight</HI> as well as <HI>pray, wrestle in prayer, pray and wrastle,</HI> and that not with God only (as <HI>Gen. 32 24.</HI>) but with Satan too, <HI>Eph. 6.12. give no place to the Devil,</HI> the while, <HI>Eph. 4.27.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate him not an Ace, <HI>veer</HI> him not an inch of ground, do not yield an hairs breadth, nor a minutes Time, we must ever watch and warr against him as our Adversary, <HI>1 Pet. 5.8.</HI> He follows thee from Bed to Board, from Company to thy Re∣tirements, from thy worldly occasions to thy Closet, into thy Garden, Field, Ship, Shop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From thy house to Gods house, and there he stands at thy right hand. He is ever with thee, seeking Occasions against thee. When he seems quiet, seems conquered, then perhaps most to be feared, some∣times he retreats, goes forth, withdraws, but it it is for Advantage, that he may get stronger possession with <HI>seven Spirits worse then himself.</HI> It may be said of him, as it was of <HI>Marcellus</HI> the <HI>Roman Commander,</HI> he was never quiet, <HI>nec Victor, nec Victus,</HI> neither beaten, nor beating, neither overcome nor overcoming. In Conversion we run away from Satans Colours and Service, whose Slaves we naturally are, and enter into Christs Pay, hence Satan pursues us (if possible) to regain us, and we have no other way to help our selves but by <HI>Fighting</HI> him. To be well acquainted with his me∣thods, Stratagems, devices, to watch him narrowly, and <HI>Fight</HI> him stoutly will be thy Interest.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>The World,</HI> one of the Devils Instruments, that he uses in the Warr, he is therefore (in part at least) called <HI>the God of this World,</HI> the world (I say) <HI>that choaks the word,</HI> and then undoes the Sinner. <HI>Beware of being intangled in the affairs of this life,</HI> if thou have taken upon thee <HI>Christs Warfare,</HI> 2 Tim. 4 4. Rather let thy <HI>Warfare</HI> especially be against the world and thy being so ensnared by it, He that while he lives in the world hath the world his <HI>Constant Enemy,</HI> he must necessarily be a Souldier▪ Unto the world we must be weaned, and God oft imbitters the Breasts of worldly comforts, dries them up, yea, <HI>crucifies the world to us,</HI> makes it as it were

dead to us, that we may the more <HI>facilely</HI> get Victory over it. The world <HI>Fight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> by presenting present sweet pleasant things to allure to sin and dete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from obedience. Pleasure, profit, Honour, are its baits to allure and draw to sin or disobedience, there be also many fears and discourage∣ments whereby it deters and drives back from the way of obedience, Hence the World fires on both sides; so must we also. Now look upon all these Enemies of our weal, these <HI>constant, perpetual, deadly Enemies,</HI> and say then if a <HI>Christian</HI> can be other then a Souldier, and see if all these will not keep him ever in work. The <HI>New man</HI> hath the Spirit and the word that set in with him, and the <HI>Old man</HI> hath the Devil and the world to help him, each <HI>Party</HI> hath its <HI>Auxiliaries, Heaven, Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> are engaged in this <HI>Warr,</HI> there is great siding and betting on either side, and there must be <HI>great Fighting</HI> by him that meaneth to win the Day.</P>
<P>And hence what is the Scripture, but the <HI>Divine Art of Military-Disci∣pline,</HI> or the Art of <HI>Divine-Military-Discipline</HI>? where God is presented as <HI>Soveraign,</HI> Christ as <HI>General,</HI> all that will be Saints <HI>are his Followers, alias Souldiers, having given up themselves to him,</HI> or listed their Names under him, they are required to march and follow him in the <HI>Spiritual Warfare</HI> against those forementioned Enemies, there are also directions how to <HI>Fight this good Fight,</HI> Encouragements to hearten them, threatenings to quicken them, Examples of those whose valour ha's been crowned, and Cowardize punished, the <HI>noteable Exploits</HI> that have been done by Believers <HI>by the strength and grace of their General,</HI> these and such like things are the summe of the Scriptures. As in the second and third Chapters of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> that which is driven at in the <HI>Epistles to the seven Churches of</HI> Asia, and is the scope of all the <HI>Directions, Counsels, Promises, Threatnings</HI> that are there set down, or discoveries of the Lords mind there made to them, is to make them good and so <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctorious Fighters,</HI> to put them on <HI>Fighting,</HI> and so as <HI>not to beat the Air,</HI> but to overcome their <HI>Spiritual Adversaries,</HI> as appears by the <HI>Common Close</HI> of each <HI>Epistle, [To him that overcometh]</HI> will I do so and so; why truly just so the very same is the scope of all the Scriptures to help us to <HI>Fight this good fight, and to finish our Course,</HI> that we may have the <HI>Crown</HI> at last.</P>
<P>This also is the Lords aim in every Sermon we hear, to instruct us in the <HI>Theory,</HI> and so fit us for the <HI>Practice</HI> of what may speak us such as the Text and Doctrine speak of. Every Sabbath day is a <HI>Training day,</HI> wherein we receive Instructions and Directions from the Lord concerning our Duty, our work as Souldiers, and all the week after we are to act over the Lessons which we then learn. <HI>Jesus Christ our King, our General,</HI> knowing the multitude of Enemies within and about us, gives the same order which <HI>Da∣vid</HI> did, 2 Sam. 1.18, <HI>viz.</HI> that we should be taught the use of the Bow, and
<PB N="11" REF="000193_0014_0FA316FCDB094F78"/>
instructed how to use our <HI>Spiritual Armor Regularly</HI> and <HI>successfully.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The promised presence and Assistance of God with his people in this world, in all their <HI>Businesses, Vndertakings, Exigents</HI> whatsoever, is de∣livered in such <HI>Metaphors</HI> as confirm the <HI>Assertion</HI> before us. <HI>He is with them,</HI> but how? <HI>as their Shield, Buckler, High-Tower, Fortress, strong-Hold,</HI> &amp;c. All which with many such like, intimate and inferr that they are in a <HI>Militant warfaring condition in this life,</HI> because otherwise there would be no need of those things. The Lord wanted not words to express his Affecti∣on to his people by, but he uses these as most <HI>significant,</HI> because most suit∣able to their Condition, and so most <HI>Intelligible</HI> by them, and <HI>acceptable</HI> to them.</P>
<P>Besides, that the <HI>Reward</HI> at last is for <HI>Overcomers,</HI> a <HI>Crown</HI> to be put upon the Head of <HI>Overcom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> when they come into that <HI>Glorious Triumphant state</HI> whither the Lord is leading them, Now the <HI>great Triumph</HI> is at the end of the Warr (though Saints have some beginnings of it now, <HI>2 Cor. 2.14.</HI>) the <HI>Crown</HI> is for the <HI>Overcomers,</HI> the <HI>Overcomers</HI> are the <HI>Fighters</HI> or <HI>Souldiers</HI>; and therefore all Believers who shall be <HI>crowned</HI> must also <HI>Fight.</HI> All that are saved are <HI>crowned,</HI> all that are <HI>crowned</HI> do <HI>overcome,</HI> all that <HI>overcome</HI> must <HI>Fight, Ergó</HI> all the Saints that shall be saved must <HI>Fight.</HI></P>

<P>Many will sometimes in a Fit talk of what they will do against sin, pro∣mise to leav it off, forsake it, kill it, give out that they will come out with such a force against Sin, as that they make no doubt to storm and take it; But Sin will give such <HI>Braggadochio's</HI> leave to talk and vapour, and will give like Answer to them as <HI>Ahab</HI> to <HI>Benhadad,</HI> when he said, <HI>that the dust of</HI> Samaria <HI>should not suffice for handfuls,</HI> &amp;c. Let not him that puts on his <HI>Harness,</HI> boast as he that puts it off, <HI>1 King. 20.10, 11.</HI> Many will <HI>declaim</HI> much against Sin, while in the mean time they <HI>nourish</HI> and <HI>cocker</HI> it; but Sin cares not for words, values only <HI>blows,</HI> and <HI>down-right blows</HI> too. The Lord hates <HI>Cowards</HI> and <HI>curses deceivers</HI> both in his worship, and other work and Service too, See, <HI>Mala. 1.14.</HI> with <HI>Jer. 48.10. Fighting</HI> weakly offends God, and advantages and encourages the Adversary. <HI>Beelzebub</HI> (saith one) <HI>like the Flies medles not with flesh that is boiling over the Fire, but when raw or cool will fly-blow and corrupt it.</HI> The Application of it is Easy, if thou art <HI>fervent</HI> in Prayer, <HI>warm</HI> in Duty, <HI>vigorous</HI> in thy opposition of <HI>Sa∣tan</HI> and <HI>Sin, Satan</HI> will avoid, <HI>Sin</HI> will yield, but if thou be <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>remiss, Satan</HI> will grow more bold, and <HI>Sin</HI> more strong. If thou art but a <HI>Fen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> a <HI>Stage-Player</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI> with a <HI>Button</HI> on the <HI>Point</HI> of thy <HI>Rapier, Satan</HI> will not be afraid to come near thee; but if he see that thy blood is warmed, and thy <HI>Spirits</HI> are up, and that thou offerest the naked point to him, art re∣solved to <HI>Fight</HI> at <HI>Sharps,</HI> and layest about thee like a man, he will stand further off.</P>
<P>When thou goest out against <HI>Sin thy great Enemy,</HI> perhaps thy <HI>deceitful Heart,</HI> that secretly too much <HI>loves Sin,</HI> will be ready enough to give such a <HI>Charge</HI> as <HI>David</HI> did to the <HI>Captains,</HI> (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.5.) <HI>deal gently,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But Christ stands in the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as thou a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t going forth,</HI> and saith, <HI>for my sake, and for thy Souls sake, and as ever thou wilt appear before me with joy</HI> at the End of the warr, <HI>deal severely, deal sharply and throughly with Sin and the Old-man.</HI> Thy <HI>Commission</HI> is to <HI>take, kill, burn, sink, destroy</HI> all sin and Corruption, &amp;c. which are professed Enemies to Christ Jesus, and not to pity or spare any of them.

Away with such Childrens play, this <HI>play-Fighting, Fighting</HI> in <HI>Jest</HI> will never attain the end to make thee a <HI>Conquerour</HI> in earnest; It may serve for a show, and so Sin may be mortified in show, and thou saved in show, but damned in <HI>Reality.</HI> If thou let go sin which God hath put into thy hand, without putting it to Death, (as he did him who was appointed to Death, <HI>1 King. 20.42.</HI>) and if thou only <HI>beat the Air,</HI> not it, (be sure it will go.)

<P>No acting but <HI>Strenuous a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing</HI> will do against the <HI>Old man,</HI> thou must fall on him <HI>couragiously, stoutly,</HI> the word in the <HI>Content</HI> signifies to <HI>box</HI> and <HI>thump manfully</HI> to be about the Ears of him and beat him all black and blew. <HI>Beza</HI> on <HI>Luk. 18.5.</HI> where the same word is used tells us that a <HI>Noun</HI> from this <HI>Verb</HI> signifies bruizes that are black and blew from the setling of the bloud there, and indeed it is as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>Prov. 20.30. the blewness of the wound cleanses evil,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Thus the Doctrine hath been in some measure explained and proved; we shall now improve it in some few particulars.</P>
<P>Is the Life of a <HI>Christian</HI> a <HI>Souldiers Life,</HI> and is he so to act as hath been said? Then this informs us something of the Nature of,</P>
<P N="1">1. The profession and practice of Religion, that it is no such <HI>easy, slighty, indifferent busin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> as many Professors make of it. Indeed to talk of Reli∣gion and make a <HI>Flourish</HI> is easy, to <HI>beat the Air</HI> is not difficult; to seem Re∣ligious is <HI>facile,</HI> but to be Religious is hard and will be found so. He utter∣ly mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes the matter that dreams of taking his ease, and nourishing <HI>Sloth</HI> in a <HI>Christian Life,</HI> that as soon as he hath given up himself to Christ, that now his work is over; I tell thee no, the <HI>Warr</HI> now begins, now there are <HI>two Principles</HI> in thee, and those in an hot dispute at the <HI>Swords point,</HI> and there must be <HI>bloud-shed</HI> and <HI>loss of Life</HI> on the one hand or the other, And sure this is no <HI>Childrens play.</HI> God knows the Sloth and slightiness of mans Heart naturally, and therefore meets with it by setting forth a <HI>Christians Imployment</HI> under such <HI>Metaphors</HI> as will allow of no <HI>Lazines, Exempli gratia</HI> Math. 11.12. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and they take it by fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce,</HI> Sin make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a violent opposition against thy going to Heaven, and therefore thou must also make a <HI>violent Resistance.</HI> If Sin and Satan can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

hinder it thou shalt never have possession of Heaven given thee, however not a <HI>peaceable</HI> and <HI>quiet Possession,</HI> and therefore thou must make a <HI>forcible Entry.</HI> Again, <HI>Luk. 13.24.</HI> you hear of <HI>Striving,</HI> being in an <HI>Agony,</HI> like men that are a <HI>wrestling,</HI> who tug and pull, and shake one another, ta∣king all Advantages to give each other the <HI>Foil</HI> or <HI>Fall. Paul</HI> us'd the same word of himself, <HI>2 Tim. 4.7. I have Fought,</HI> &amp;c. I have <HI>striven</HI> that good <HI>strift,</HI> have well acted the part of a <HI>Wrestler. Striving</HI> implies action, <HI>Intenssness</HI> of Action, and that against a great deal of opposition. So [<HI>Run∣ning</HI>] in the <HI>Context</HI> is used in the same Sense, now <HI>Running</HI> is opposed to standing still, and also to moving slowly, it is a <HI>vigorous, lively motion.</HI> So <HI>2 Pet. 1.5, 10. Giving all Diligence, Jude</HI> 3. <HI>Contending earnestly,</HI> Psal. 63.8 <HI>Following God, following him hard,</HI> and that with the <HI>Soul,</HI> Rom. 12.11. <HI>Fervency of Spirit, warm</HI> and <HI>vigorous acting.</HI></P>
<P>But I need not go from this <HI>Metaphor</HI> of the <HI>Tent, Fighting</HI> is work, not play, <HI>hard work,</HI> (2 Tim. 2.4.) mens work, <HI>dangerous work.</HI> And let us about this Warr, Consider that it is.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Near us, yea, within us, not at a distance, two Men in every Christian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Between us, our selves and our selves are the parties concerned.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Politickly and powerfully managed on either hand, by the Parties and their Auxiliaries.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mortal, not some small blows, light scarrs, but Death on the one or the other side is the end of it.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Soul-Warr, the soul is warred against,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.11. <HI>and the Eternal Weal or Woe of the soul is the result of it.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Irreconcileable without Atonement.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Constant without Interm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion,</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Perpetual without End, till death puts an End to the Combatants and combate both at once.</HI></P>
<P>I say, Consider these particulars, and then say when may a Christian be <HI>Lazy</HI> or <HI>slothful</HI>? what leisure-Time shall he find to gratify a sluggish Spirit? where is there any room for slighty and <HI>superficial Carriages</HI> in his work? At what time may he have a Licence to say to his Soul, <HI>Soul take thine Ease, eat, drink, and be merry,</HI> (at least in that sense as he did, <HI>Luk. 12.19.</HI> and many still do) when will it be lawful for him to lay down his Arms, put off his Sword, unbend his Bow? where will you find from God or from the na∣ture of the work any allowance or Countenance for that <HI>dulness sleepiness, se∣curity</HI> and <HI>Indifferency</HI> that finds so much Countenance among men? And do not wonder to see in your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourny Heaven-ward</HI> the way bestrewed with <HI>dead Carkasses,</HI> and to see such Troops of <HI>dastardly Cowards,</HI> and <HI>white livered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint hearted, milk sopps</HI> upon their <HI>Retreat,</HI> and when you come there do not wonder to see so few Professors there, but rather that any should so <HI>Fight</HI>

as to <HI>Overcome,</HI> that considering the opposition, any should obtain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Then it will be good prudence for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l that are looking Christ-ward to sit down first and count the Cost,</HI> Luk. 14.25-33, Christs deals plainly with us and tells us what we must trust too, let not us deceive our selves. <HI>Zebeaes sons</HI> were for a <HI>Kingdome,</HI> but Christ tells them of a <HI>Cross, a Cup, a Baptism and a bitter one too,</HI> Math. 20.22, 23. and so should we tell our selves of the <HI>Warr</HI> as well as the <HI>Reward,</HI> of the <HI>way,</HI> as well as the <HI>End,</HI> not only of the Crown to be worn, but of the Sword, that by which it must be won before worn.</P>
<P>Many when they hear of the Gospel and <HI>word of Grace,</HI> they like the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ground</HI> (Math. 13.) <HI>Immediately receive it with Joy,</HI> perhaps are told of the Warr, but do not consider of it, or if they do it is the <HI>Plunder</HI> and <HI>Tri∣umphs</HI> that their mind is mainly on, hence when they meet with bloud and and wounds, repent of their choice, <HI>when Persecution arises they are offended,</HI> and lay down their Profession as hastily as they took it up inconsiderately, <HI>ver. 5.20, 21.</HI> Its good therefore for a Christian <HI>to look before he leaps,</HI> lest af∣ter he hath advanced he draw back again, throw down his weapons, run away from his <HI>Colours,</HI> and make a <HI>shameful Retreat.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Jesus looks back on all that are following him, and saith, I have a <HI>Crown</HI> for you, but you must <HI>Fight</HI> for it; a <HI>Kingdome</HI> for you, but you must <HI>take it by Force.</HI> What ever Christ proposes to us we should Consi∣der of. Now his question to us is, (and should be ours to our selves) Can we <HI>Fight</HI>? can we venture where Arrows and Bullets flie? can we Face an Army? can we <HI>endure Hardship as good Souldiers of Jesus Christ</HI> must do? Can we bid defiance to Sin, send a Challenge to our <HI>bosome lusts</HI>? can we be content to live a life of opposition to every Sin? We are naturally for Ease and quiet, would fain live without Care and fear, meet with no cross or trouble, swim down the Stream without any stop or check, not to have a strong Tide to row against, or be forced to turn it up against a <HI>Trade-wind</HI> of <HI>perpetual Opposition.</HI> Most are like <HI>Issachar</HI> to whom rest is sweet, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.14. whereas we should be like <HI>Judah,</HI> and divers other of the <HI>Tribes</HI> who are described to be of <HI>warlike Spirits,</HI> some with open force, others with <HI>subtle Stratagems</HI> engaging against their Adversaries, Only that <HI>Tribe</HI> was <HI>dull</HI> and <HI>low-spirited.</HI> We are therefore to examine our own Hearts, God will try them and so should we. The Lord would not lead <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ael</HI> by that way lest they should see vvar and so recant, <HI>Exod. 13.17.</HI> but God will lead us that way where we shall see <HI>Warr,</HI> and that vvay we must go or none, for there is no other, and <HI>woe to us</HI> if we do recant.</P>
<P>Great will be the <HI>Advantage</HI> that will acrue to us by <HI>due Consideration</HI> of these things before hand, hereby we shall be put into a posture of <HI>Expecta∣tion</HI> of <HI>difficulties,</HI> and <HI>hard Hardship</HI> in this <HI>Warfare</HI> will be no new thing to us, and so we shall not be so likely to be <HI>Surprized</HI> or <HI>offended.</HI> Expectation

Again, it will prevent our <HI>Apostatizing</HI> and <HI>falling back</HI> from our <HI>Profession</HI> after we have engaged in it. <HI>Apostacy</HI> from a Profession made, arises from want of due pondering what we did when we fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st made it, and were like to suffer in the prosecuting of it. Therefore let us be advised and deliberate in taking up a Profession of the Name of Christ, lest that which was rashly <HI>enterprized</HI> be <HI>groundlesly deserted.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let no poor sincere hearted Follower of Christ be discouraged, as if all were not well with him because he meets with much Fighting and Opposition, no peace or quiet</HI>; Enemies come on him like the waves of the Sea, scarce can have one resting day or night, <HI>the Devil</HI> ever beating up his <HI>Quarters,</HI> his own <HI>Treacherous Heart</HI> often betraying him to <HI>Satans tempta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions</HI> and <HI>Al∣lurements,</HI> &amp;c. Why know this is no strange thing, see <HI>1 Pet</HI> 4.12. <HI>Paul</HI> could tell you as much as all this upon his own Experience, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 7.) He stood to his Arms when he first engaged for Christ, and never laid them down till he came to lay down himself in the Grave. It was no Argument that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and his Company were not about Gods work, because they were fain to hold the <HI>Sword</HI> in the one hand, and the <HI>Trowel</HI> in the other, <HI>Neh</HI> 4 17, <HI>Rebecca</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o just cause of fear by reason of the <HI>struglings and Fightings within her,</HI> Gen. 25.22, 23. <HI>She had conceived by the Son of the Pro∣mise,</HI> only there were <HI>Twins.</HI> Say not then, if so, why am I thus?

<P>To you that are discouraged because you feel the <HI>Body of Sin</HI> in you <HI>Fight∣ing</HI> and <HI>disturbing</HI> you, let me say, there is one though you should not feel it, and to feel it is a mercy, yea, to feel and <HI>Fight</HI> it is a Duty That it is there is most certain, that you feel it there speaks some Life, that you <HI>Fight</HI> it some Strength also, and consequently your Frame is in some measure right, as well as your state good.</P>
<P>It is the Condition of every man to be either <HI>taken Captive</HI> or in <HI>Warr</HI>: if <HI>Captived at Satans will</HI> he may have a kind of peace or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he present, but no wise man will think such an one safe; if in <HI>Warr</HI> it speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gotten out, or at least getting out of his Snare, and that is comfortable.</P>
<P>Then let not Satan <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and make thee wound thy self with thine

Alas <HI>they know not that they are poor and miserable,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>(Rev. 3.)</HI> they feel not the <HI>Iron yoke</HI> upon their <HI>Neck,</HI> nor the <HI>Chains of darkness</HI> at their <HI>heels,</HI> at least they do not feel Sin to be as a <HI>Yoke,</HI> as <HI>Chains, cords</HI> and <HI>Fetters,</HI> hence not <HI>startled,</HI> not <HI>affected</HI>; but (<HI>miserable self-destroying sinners</HI> that they be) stop their Ears at the <HI>Proclamation</HI> of the <HI>Year of Jubile, the acceptable Year of the Lord</HI> is not an <HI>accepted Year</HI> to them, they turn their <HI>backs</HI> upon the <HI>tenders</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> hugg their <HI>chains,</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se their Captivity, love their <HI>Bondage</HI> and refuse to go out free.

and <HI>bemoaning</HI> themselves but seldom, hence in stead of following Christ who would lead them out of this <HI>Slavery</HI> they rather prepare Warr against him, and use their utmost Endeavours to keep themselves in. Well, one of the next mercies to the giving of Jesus Christ to a poor sinner is the making him <HI>throughly sensible</HI> of his <HI>misery,</HI> and <HI>disquieting</HI> and <HI>distressing</HI> him there∣upon with on Christ. Oh pray for that work to be wrought, and pray that none may (as it is frequent for many to do) look up a little at the first hear∣ing or reading of such a Truth, but soon lay down their <HI>drowsy heads</HI> again, and make a Shift ere long to get <HI>asleep</HI> again, and dream that notwithstanding all that hath been said, <HI>they shall have peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It alarms them that though they make a show and pretend high, yet in re∣ality do play rather then work, talk rather then Fight, and so indeed do but beat the Air.</HI> Christ loves to see a man that girds up the <HI>loins</HI> of his <HI>mind,</HI> and <HI>buckles</HI> to his work, that puts his <HI>Bones</HI> as well as his <HI>Brains</HI> to it, and laies about him like a man.

it vvill be ill vvith us. We are in the same Case as those Souldiers vvhom when the <HI>Commander</HI> had landed on the <HI>Enemies Country</HI>▪ he burnt up their Ships that transported them, and then told them that they must either eat up these men (<HI>i. e.</HI> their Enemies before them) or drink up that Sea, inti∣mating that there was no way left but to it they must, and that upon the pe∣ril of their lives. God hath set us here in our <HI>Enemies Country</HI> where we must either <HI>Fight manfully,</HI> or <HI>die shamefully.</HI> Now to further us in this our work, take some <HI>Directions</HI> and <HI>Encouragements,</HI> and that,</P>
<P N="1">1. Unto all those who are or would be <HI>accounted Christians,</HI> and therefore must be <HI>Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To those in particular, who are <HI>Souldiers</HI> and also <HI>Christians,</HI> or to <HI>Christian Souldiers</HI> and <HI>Souldier Christians.</HI></P>
<P>To the former let me say these following words, and that,</P>
<P N="1">1. By way of Direction, 1. <HI>Make sure that your Names, and Hearts as well Names are given up to the Service of Christ.</HI> Remember that in your <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> you took <HI>Press-mony</HI> from the Lord, engaging you to serve him in the <HI>Warr,</HI> against <HI>the World, the Flesh, and the Devil,</HI> and as you grow up he ex∣pects that you should Answer for your selves, what side you are for. All men are Souldiers either in the <HI>Devils Regiment,</HI> or under Christs <HI>Banner.</HI> Be not then <HI>halting between two Opinions,</HI> be not <HI>Neuters,</HI> but <HI>deliberately</HI> make your choice. Jesus Christ is lifted up as an <HI>Ensign</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and wherever the Gospel is preached he sets up his <HI>Standard,</HI> and causes it to be proclaimed by sound of <HI>Trumpet,</HI> that whoever will fall off from Satan and come and put themselves under him, they shall be welcome to him, and pro∣tected by him. Oh then when he saith who wilt thou be for, say, let thy Soul say, Lord I will be for thee and for no other. He off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs thee Conditions of <HI>Peace,</HI> comply with them then, for thou canst not meet him in an <HI>Host<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le way</HI> with thy <HI>poor, miserable, naked Soul,</HI> who ha's his <HI>twenty Thousand</HI> As <HI>Luk 14.</HI> yea, <HI>Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand</HI> to wait on him. Do not then <HI>harden thy heart against him,</HI> for <HI>thou wilt not Prosper</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> submit to him, and be free in it. All Christs Souldiers are <HI>Volunteers,</HI> Psal. 110.3. They are the <HI>men of Desires that offer themselves willingly,</HI> Judg 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That being done, enquire who are Christs Friends and Foes, and let them be thine too</HI>; do not mistake and <HI>Fight</HI> Friends, while thou compliest with Foes, and if thou dost the former, thou wilt not shun the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter. Do not as they, <HI>Isai. 5.20.</HI> hugg a Lust when thou shouldest stab it, embrace a <HI>darling sin</HI> when thou shouldest cut the throat of it, <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he World</HI> when thou should hate it. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contrà</HI> do not be shy of <HI>Holi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess</HI> vvhen thou oughtest to <HI>seek, pursue and perfect it,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Be at peace with God,</HI> get and keep him on your side, and then none <HI>can be against you,</HI> at least shall not hurt you, <HI>Rom 8.</HI> Nothing vvill more <HI>further</HI> and <HI>succeed</HI> you. Warr vvith Sin then your <HI>peace with G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> When

<HI>Sauls</HI> Time of Punishment for his Treachery and Cowardize drew nigh, he bustled all he could to save his Stakes, but God was departed from him, and then there was no help for him. Heaven would not, Hell could not relieve him though he implored Aid from both, see <HI>1 Sam. 28,</HI> and <HI>Chap. 31.</HI> But if God be on your side, victory must needs be there too.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Be Couragious,</HI> Courage is an <HI>high Accomplishment</HI> of a <HI>Souldier,</HI> and most indispensibly requisite in a Christian. Faint Hearts will shew them∣selves false ones, when the pinch comes. How often did the Lord say unto <HI>Joshua,</HI> (Chap. 1.) <HI>Be strong and of a good Courage,</HI> and it was on the same account that we are, when he was going to Warr for <HI>Canaan.</HI> Hear the Lord saying to us as to them, <HI>Deut. 20.1-4.</HI> and say we to our selves, and one another as they did, <HI>1 Sam. 4.9.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Get well armed.</HI> Good Armour will help to good Courage, he that is unarmed or ill armed must needs be faint-hearted, and one <HI>Coward</HI> is enough to spoyle a <HI>whole Company.</HI> The Lord hath a <HI>good Armoury</HI> where you may be furnished. See <HI>Eph. 6.10, &amp;c.</HI> And when you have this Armour, prove it, try what your Faith can do, what your hope, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> can do. Suppose Cases of Diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulty, as <HI>David</HI> does, <HI>Psal. 27.1, 2, 3.</HI> and supposing your selves to be in such Cases, see what work you can make of it, suppose the loss of friends, near Relations, Estate, Health, yea, suppose Death looking in at your window, try if you dare face it, make proof of the strength of it, and see if you are able to grapple with it. Supposed Cases will furnish and fit you for real Cases. Be often handling your Arms, and use will make you prompt, the frequent handling them will help you to handle them handily, expertly, dex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erously, successfully.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Be at variance with every sin, get inward, setled, radicated heart-Hatred against sin as such, and then thou wilt oppose every sin.</HI> Correspondence with one sin will ruine thee. Do not spare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny because a little one (thy doing so will be a great one) neither dare to connive at any, because sometime a dear one, and still a secret one. God sees, and is a witness of all secret sins, (<HI>Jer. 29.23.</HI>) Be not bold, do not adventure to commit one sin in hopes of a pardon, lest <HI>the Lord of Hosts</HI> should answer thee as sometimes a <HI>Com∣mander</HI> did an offending Souldier who pleaded that it was the first Time, or he had done so but once, quoth he, Souldiers must offend but once. To sin once is once too much.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Begin with Sin betimes,</HI> ere it grows to an Head and the Conspiracy strengthen. <HI>Achitophels Counsel</HI> was fatal if it had been followed. I will pur∣sue him this night, while weak and weary, <HI>2 Sam. 17.1, 2.</HI> Let this Counsel be acceptable to thee, it is (as was said of his) as if thou shouldest ask Coun∣sel at the <HI>Oracle of God,</HI> nay it is the <HI>Oracle of God,</HI> follow Sin this night, re∣solve against it this moment, and pursue it speedily. Sin is like Fire in the

House-Top, either quench it presently, or else all will be in a Flame within a few moments, and in <HI>ashes</HI> within a few more. The <HI>Twig</HI> will come up easily, but the <HI>Tree</HI> when grown up will be <HI>Invincible.</HI> Sin is a <HI>great Breeder,</HI> a <HI>little Company</HI> will soon increase to a <HI>potent Army.</HI> And it will grow <HI>strong</HI> as fast as <HI>numerous.</HI> Then <HI>take the little Foxes,</HI> (Cant 2, 15.) the <HI>old ones</HI> may be too <HI>sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> and too <HI>nimble</HI> to be taken Begin with Sin as soon as it begins with thee, nip it in the <HI>bud,</HI> crush it in the <HI>Egg,</HI> the first <HI>risings</HI> &amp; <HI>motions</HI> of Sin do thou rise up in Arms and move against. The <HI>Emphasis</HI> of <HI>Achitophels Counsel</HI> lay in the <HI>Circumstance</HI> of <HI>Time [this Night]</HI> and hence <HI>Hushai's policy</HI> was only to strike at that, and by so doing <HI>enervated</HI> and weakened the whole, so that it was <HI>turned to folly.</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> of many a sinner is so far convinced of that <HI>plain Truth</HI> that sin must be <HI>fought,</HI> that the Devil seeth it <HI>bootless</HI> to beat him out of that, dares not say the Counsel is not Good, only it is not good at this Time, what needest make so much hast as to go this night, stay and sleep upon it, <HI>to Morrow is a new day,</HI> another Time may do as well, and thus while the sinner delays, <HI>Sin</HI> increases, delaying to oppose sin is a sin, and gives way to more sin, and the renewing of the <HI>Act</HI> strengthens the <HI>Habit. Custome</HI> in <HI>Sin</HI> will prove a <HI>second Nature,</HI> and be as <HI>incureable</HI> as the <HI>Ethiopians Colour</HI> or the <HI>Leopards Spots.</HI> Unto none is it of so great Concernment to take the very <HI>nick</HI> of <HI>Time</HI> as <HI>Souldiers,</HI> especially <HI>Christian Souldiers.</HI> The <HI>Bratts</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> may more easily be <HI>dasht against the Stones,</HI> if we take the <HI>Season</HI> for it, but if we let them grow up they will become more <HI>formidable,</HI> and <HI>hardly Conquerable.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>In stead of making any Provision for, endeavour to cut off all Provision from the Flesh, watch against the occasions of Sin, and resist them strongly.</HI> It's ac∣counted <HI>good Policy</HI> in <HI>Warr</HI> to leave as little Provision as may be in the <HI>Enemies way,</HI> men will burn and destroy even in their own Country to prevent the Enemies finding relief. How foolishly do they act then who pretend to <HI>Fight Sin,</HI> and yet secretly supply it with <HI>Provision</HI> &amp; <HI>Ammuniti∣on</HI> to carry on the <HI>Warr</HI>? The <HI>Flesh</HI> hath many Inventions to provide for it self, will <HI>shift noteably,</HI> and <HI>the Devil</HI> is a <HI>careful Cater</HI> and <HI>Purveyor</HI> for it, it needs none of our help. He that keeps not himself from the Occasion, can∣not expect that God will keep him from the Sin. Some Lusts like some <HI>strong-holds</HI> may be easier starved then taken by <HI>Storm,</HI> yea, no lust will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taken that is not <HI>starved,</HI> or dye if you give it meat.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Plant your main Battery against your nearest and dearest Sins, your own iniquities. Deal with that Sin that is as a right hand, and eye, and deal most surely there.</HI> Those that thou art most endangered by, thou shouldest make most <HI>Opposition</HI> against. If there be any thing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holds <HI>Correspondence</HI> with the Enemy, no wonder thou art betrayed. Satan could do Christ no harm because <HI>he found nothing in him,</HI> Joh. 14.30. The less thou hast in thee
<PB N="23" REF="000193_0026_0FA31705465FD600"/>
for Satan, the less can he do without thee against thy self. And indeed it is little that he doth against thee without thee, I mean, without thine own ha∣ving an Hand in it; the most he does is to <HI>strike Sparks</HI> upon our <HI>Tinder</HI> or <HI>Powder,</HI> to bring <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Bellows</HI> to our <HI>dry S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubble,</HI> do but damp that <HI>com∣bustible matter</HI> that is in thee, and he will lose much of his labour. <HI>Fight neither with small nor great but with the King,</HI> was a Charge he gave his <HI>Soul∣diers,</HI> (2 King. 18 30.) So let us <HI>Fight</HI> mainly against the <HI>King-lusts, com∣manding Inclinations</HI> and <HI>Desires.</HI> When the Enemies and Traytors with∣in are conquered, executed, at least the <HI>Leaders</HI> or <HI>Heads</HI> of them, thou wilt with less danger oppose the Rest. Let the <HI>Head-sins</HI> be taken off, and the other will fly like the <HI>Philistines</HI> when <HI>Goliath</HI> their <HI>Champion</HI> was dead.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>When Sin begins to fall follow it close, give it no breathing, no recruit∣ing Time, pursue thy victory, lee it not have leisure to rally, but follow the Chase till none be left remaining.</HI> The <HI>Sun shall stand still</HI> at Joshua's <HI>prayer</HI> to give him opportunity to be avenged on his Enemies, <HI>Chap. 10.12, 13.</HI> If thou hast a Spirit to pray and pursue Sin thou shalt want neither light nor help to give it an utter overthrow.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Be much for Order.</HI> Christians are Souldiers and that in <HI>actual Ex∣ercise,</HI> now <HI>Souldiers</HI> in <HI>Exercise,</HI> at least if they exercise well are great ob∣servers of <HI>Order.</HI> What is an Army in a <HI>Rout,</HI> or <HI>Christians</HI> out of their places? It was both <HI>sightly</HI> and <HI>safe</HI> for <HI>Israel</HI> that came <HI>harnessed</HI> out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to march in such exact Order through the wilderness. Hear his saying concerning them, <HI>Numb▪</HI> 24.5. <HI>Order is Beau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and safety.</HI> Then let each know and keep his own place, and not while inquisitive into other mens places and duties, neglect his own. Let <HI>Leaders</HI> lead, and let the rest follow; let <HI>Commanders</HI> command▪ and let the rest obey, else there will be <HI>Confusion.</HI> They are the best <HI>Souldiers</HI> that can keep from a <HI>Rout,</HI> and the next best that can <HI>rally</HI> soonest. The best will sometimes miss it, but miserable are they who when out cannot bear to be reduced or brought in. As much as possi∣ble keep in; if out, as soon as possible fall in again. Keep in your places and you keep out of danger. <HI>Strayers</HI> from their <HI>Colours</HI> or <HI>straglers</HI> from their places will soon be snapt up.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Be constant in Christs Service. His standard is ever in the Field, do not fly from your Colours.</HI> The work of Christian Souldiers is not a <HI>Battel</HI> but a <HI>Warr,</HI> when once listed never freed, no not after sixty years, as in <HI>Israels Camp.</HI> Beware of neglecting any Season of going to <HI>Warr,</HI> 2 Sam 11.1.</P>

It is usually observed that in Con∣troversies and Contentions, though one party might be mainly to blame at the beginning of them, yet if they continue long, it is much if either be wholly Innocent.</P>
<P>Our being Souldiers saith we must <HI>Fight,</HI> but our Rule as Christians tells us against whom we must <HI>Fight</HI> viz. sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for whom <HI>viz.</HI> for Christ and the <HI>Common Faith,</HI> not one against another, nor for our Lusts, and yet from them all our <HI>Warrs</HI> and <HI>Fightings come,</HI> Jam. 4.1, Small matters oft make <HI>Great Breaches,</HI> A little Earth sometimes, <HI>a Fancy, a humour, a Lust,</HI> &amp;c. why better lose much of our Earth, Fancy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all our ill humours and Lusts then any of our peace. The <HI>Fig-tree</HI> Jud. 9.11. feared losing its sweet∣ness if it should accept of promotion over the Trees: I am sure while we con∣tend for promotion over others, contend to promote our wills and humours above others (and the Text tells us <HI>Prov. 13.10.</HI> that <HI>only by pride comes con∣tention</HI>) we lose our peace, our quietness, our sweetness, and sowre our selves, into a frame unpleasing to God and unprofitable to our selves and others, and the Gain will never countervaile the Damage. One of the <HI>highest pieces</HI> of Souldiery is for a man to <HI>Overcome himself,</HI> and he that hath attained that skill will be a Conquerour where ever he comes, no evil shall overcome him, but he will overcome it by doing of good, <HI>(Rom. 12.21.)</HI> and that is the <HI>noblest conquest</HI> in the world. Mistake not Courage &amp; valour to think it consists in <HI>rendring evil for evil,</HI> (no, when thou dost so thou art overcome, and shewest thy self a Coward) or being able to give persons as good as they bring, to be even with them, stand out stifly against them and not yield, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No, he is truly Couragious &amp; stout hearted that can stoop rather then quarrel, yield rather then sin. <HI>Abraham</HI> shewed as much true <HI>Christian magnanimity</HI> when he yielded to <HI>Lot</HI> to prevent strife (<HI>Gen. 13.</HI>) As when he faced all those Kings and deli∣vered <HI>Lot,</HI> Gen. 14. <HI>True magnanimity</HI> shews it self in an <HI>utter Impotency</HI> and <HI>inability</HI> to do any thing against Truth and peace. Courage of the right stamp appears in daring to grapple and Collar with thine own Lusts and Corruptions, in <HI>enduring hardness,</HI> (2 Tim. 2, 4.) and hard dealing too, with∣out being put out of thy way thereby.</P>
<P>Then set all Christians <HI>move, act, harmonize</HI> as <HI>one Body, and members of the same Body.</HI> Refer our zeal and host for the Enemy, and then lay it out when it may <HI>praise God,</HI> and be sure the wrath of Professors of Religion one against another does not work his <HI>praise,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<HI>Fire of Contention.</HI> God is angry at our being angry with one another, our selves are wofully distempered and damnified, others <HI>Scandalized</HI> and <HI>har∣dened,</HI> Satan only smiles because he gains the while. In these <HI>pudled waters</HI> the Devil accounts (because by experience he finds) that it is <HI>good Fishing,</HI> and though he cannot Fish out (no more then he could <HI>winnow</HI> out, Luk. 22.31, 32,) any <HI>true Grace,</HI> yet he may deprive us of the <HI>present, profitable,</HI> and <HI>com∣fortable Exercise</HI> of it; and he may, and often doth at such Times fish out all the <HI>seeming grace</HI> of an <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> and make him manifest in his own <HI>Colours. Quarrelling Times</HI> are <HI>trying Times,</HI> and <HI>manifesting Times,</HI> those that have any <HI>Faith, love, patience,</HI> &amp;c. it will then appear; and those that had nothing but a <HI>show</HI> of these will then show what they had. Yea, the Saints themselves when troubled, shaken and disturbed by the <HI>Storm</HI> of <HI>Contention,</HI> do cause more <HI>filth</HI> and <HI>froth</HI> to rise then either themselves or others thought to have been there.</P>
<P>Offences have been and will be, <HI>Controversies</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> have been by Satan <HI>raised</HI> and <HI>fomented</HI> in all <HI>Ages,</HI> which have occasioned great <HI>digladiations</HI> among Christians. Hence <HI>Pulpits</HI> and <HI>Presses</HI> have been more then glutted with many <HI>Polemick</HI> and <HI>unedifying Discourses,</HI> besides <HI>sharp Debates</HI> in pri∣vate, by which much precious Time hath been wasted, that will be dearly missed one day. And for men either in publick or private Capacity to be much (much more to delight to be much, and being much will breed delight) in those matters, to travel farr in that <HI>Road,</HI> how well it suits with their feet who are to be <HI>stood with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,</HI> (one piece of our <HI>Spiritual Armor</HI>) I leave them to Judge who have for any considerable Time worn that Shooe. To study to disquiet Lust and sin in our selves first, and al∣so in others is given us in Charge, but in the mean Time to <HI>study to be quiet</HI> in our selves and with others, lies very fair and full in our <HI>Commission</HI> and <HI>In∣structions,</HI> 1 Thes 4 11. with <HI>2 Thes. 3.12.</HI> That the <HI>Sword</HI> should devour for ever while there is any Sin remaining to be the <HI>Antagonist,</HI> must be for ever owned; but if the <HI>Sword</HI> devour at all, much more for ever, while our Brethren are the Subjects of it, <HI>this will be bitterness in the latter end,</HI> 2 Sam. 2.26. Let <HI>Pulpits</HI> ring with the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> the bitterness and vile∣ness of Sin, the excellency of Christ, the <HI>freeness</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> the necessity of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> toward God, <HI>Superlative Love</HI> to Christ and to one ano∣ther as our selves; and let private discourses and <HI>Occasional Conferences</HI> be∣tween <HI>Fellow-Souldiers</HI> throughout the whole Army, be the <HI>Eccho</HI> of such Counsels, and our Carriage and Conversation toward God and one another, the Examples of those Rules, if (I say) men were thus busied they would have little list or leisure to quarrel, and many of our endless and <HI>fruitless Con∣troversies</HI> would die alone. There is a great deal of <HI>Profaneness, Sensuality, worldly mindedness, pride, want of Love,</HI> &amp;c. againgst these let the <HI>voice he lifted

<P N="14">14. <HI>Walk humbly both with God and among men.</HI> If Humility be not one of the pieces of our Spiritual Armor exprest, <HI>Eph. 6.</HI> yet it is the Grace of the whole. Humility in a Souldier sets him forth more then all his Bravery besides; so Humility in a Christian is the very Bravery of a Christian. Its called his raiment, <HI>1 Pet. 5.</HI>5. And indeed the rest of our Graces are so ragged that we had need have the <HI>upper Garment</HI> of <HI>Humility</HI> over all, lest <HI>the shame of our nakedness appear. Vain-Glory,</HI> which is the proud mans study, is an empty study, a vain study. Do not talk great words: nor make great shows or Flourishes, but do great things. Neither should the Souldier or Christian be a <HI>Vapour,</HI> a <HI>Flash,</HI> a <HI>Bubble, Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pretereà nihil,</HI> but be a through and sub∣stantial doer in all that he does do, and let thy deeds speak, and they will say enough, <HI>Prov. 31.</HI> ult. Do high and loud deeds: while you speak little and low words, say little, but do the more, do not speak <HI>swelling words,</HI> but do <HI>swelling works,</HI> and these works will speak words big enough to guard thee against obscurity or oblivion, will get thee a Name and Fame that shall never be forgotten.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Know your strength lies more in, and your success is more from the General then your selves.</HI> The Security of our Lives is more from the Grace in Christ for us, then from the Grace from Christ in us. Indeed we must keep our Graces bright and in Exercise, our weapons on and in use, let not our Swords rust in our Scabbards that they will not draw, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet still the Exercise of our Graces when we have them, and their success when we use them is from him <HI>without whom we can do nothing.</HI> He gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds us and prospers us. Eye him, imitate him, keep him near us, with us, within us, and then we shall be <HI>more then Conquerours through him that hath loved us.</HI> He only who died for Sin, can be the death of Sin in thee.</P>
<P N="16">16. Finally, <HI>Think much of your last Enemy Death,</HI> with whom also you must combate, and this part of your Warr will give you a full dischage from all the Rest. It becomes Christs Souldiers to be no strangers to death, who are called so often to Face it, and ever to carry their Lives in their Hands.</P>
<P>And you aged Christians, you old, beaten, experienced Souldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, do not carry all your Experiences with you into the Grave. You have been long acquainted with Satans method and manner of <HI>Fighting,</HI> and versed in the Stratagems of Warr, you may be of excellent use and great bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssings among a Company of young Beginners, spend what you m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Time that is left you in instructing, informing and encourageing those that have as yet learnt but a little Warr.

<PB N="28" REF="000193_0031_0FA317090632BB20"/>
to impart to you. And it will much conduce to your comfortable laying down your Heads in the Grave, that you shall leave others behind you who are engaged in the same <HI>Warr</HI> with your selves, and likely through Grace to manage it well.</P>
<P N="2">2. By way of Encouragement, let me add a few words.</P>
<P>And Suppose you heard our <HI>Great Captain</HI> speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng these words to us this day, to hearten us in our work; and if any need <HI>Heartening Courage</HI> and <HI>Encouragement,</HI> it is the <HI>Souldier,</HI> and if any <HI>Souldier</HI> it's the <HI>Christian,</HI> unto whom it had need often be said, as <HI>Isai. 35.3, 4.</HI> Then (<HI>Fellow Souldiers</HI>) let us know;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We have a good General,</HI> one that is <HI>Sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lful, able, Compassionate,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the Lord of Hosts,</HI> who when all the <HI>Armies</HI> of <HI>Sin, Lust,</HI> &amp;c. are gathered together against us, and the <HI>Devil</HI> the Leader of the <HI>Black Guard,</HI> he can <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Countermand</HI> them all.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We have a good Cause,</HI> The Warr with Sin and Satan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a iust and and lawful Warr, and also profitable, no plunder like the profit to be had in this Warr.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We have good Company, good Fellow Souldiers,</HI> all of them like the Chil∣dren of a King, nay indeed they are such.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all well Armed,</HI> each part Armed, and the Armor of each part <HI>Impenetrable.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Our Enemies are already conquered by Christ Jesus our General.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We Warr not at our own Charge:</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Nor in our own Strength,</HI> for in the hottest and sharpest dispute, we have our <HI>Leader</HI> with us, ordering matters himself, and affording us strength from himself. He is with us in the <HI>Fight,</HI> be it in <HI>Fire, water, Furnace,</HI> &amp;c. see <HI>Isai. 43.1, 2. Dan. 3.</HI> He is like that <HI>Commander</HI> who was never wont to bid his <HI>Souldiers [Goe]</HI> but [<HI>Come</HI>] himself being ever present with them, and going before them. see <HI>Rom. 8.31, 37. Psal. 118.7. Heb. 13.5. Psal. 18.1, 2. 1 Joh. 4.4.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>If we are indeed his Souldiers, he will preserve us and see us all forth com∣ing. Have we given up our Names to him, believed on him, then he will keep what we commit to him till that day,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.12. He can, and does warrant all our lives throughout the whole <HI>Warr,</HI> which no <HI>General</HI> on Earth can do. All that <HI>Fight</HI> for, and with Christ, shall live with him.

<P>Chear up <HI>Fellow-Souldiers,</HI> take heart in <HI>Grace</HI>: it's true we have many Enemies, many <HI>Swords, Pikes, Bullets</HI> about us, the <HI>Arrows</HI> fly thick, and these and those drop down on our <HI>right hand</HI> and <HI>left,</HI> but it is with us, as 1 <HI>Sam. 22.23.</HI> they that seek our Life seek Christs Life, but with him we shall be in Safety. They that seek to take away thine, must seek, and find, and take away His too, or else miss their Aim, <HI>for thy Life is bid with Christ in God,</HI> Col. 3.3. When Christ comes to give an account of his <HI>Souldiers</HI> un∣der his care to the <HI>Father,</HI> he will say (as <HI>Joh. 17.) Father I have not lost one of them,</HI> not one of my <HI>true-hearted Souldiers</HI> how weak soever, The <HI>Cowards,</HI> the <HI>Traytors</HI> indeed are gone, but not one of the rest. <HI>Paul</HI> could say, I <HI>have Fought,</HI> &amp;c. and so there is a <HI>Crown</HI> for me, <HI>2 Tim.</HI> 4 7. what he said at the end of his Course, thou maiest say at the beginning of thine, (for <HI>Christ</HI> that is the <HI>Author</HI> is also the <HI>Finisher,</HI> Heb. 12▪2.) and it is as true Divinity to say, he that is <HI>Fighting</HI> (in the present Tense) is sure to be <HI>crowned,</HI> as he that hath <HI>Fought</HI> in the preterperfect Tense: if <HI>Finishing</HI> thou art as safe as if thou hadst <HI>Finished.</HI> If you <HI>Fight the Lords Battels,</HI> your Souls are <HI>bound up in the Bundle of Life,</HI> 1 Sam. 25.28.

<P>I shall close with a few words to those that have been the Occasion of this present Assembly, and what I say to you, may be of use to all of like <HI>Profession</HI> with your selves.</P>
<P>You called me hither, (<HI>Worshipful, Honoured and Beloved</HI>) that <HI>I</HI> might (to give it in your own words) dispense to you some word in the Name of the Lord for your Incouragement in your work; I shall therefore according to your desire present you with a word of Incouragement, and a word of Ad∣vice also.</P>
<P>By way of Incouragement, my Text ha's matter enough.</P>
<P N="1">1. I need not insist largely on (though my Text will bear it,) the <HI>Law∣fulness</HI> and <HI>commendableness</HI> of your Imployment as Souldiers, which yet may be mentioned as a word of Encouragement to you; and that is hinted here and elsewhere in the Scripture where the Lord makes use of this as one of the most

fit, suitable and <HI>significant Emblems</HI> of a Christian Life, which he would not do, at least so much, if the Calling it self were not lawful. There is a <HI>Gene∣ration</HI> that call these Exercises <HI>carnal Exercises,</HI> and your <HI>Weapons carnal VVeapons,</HI> but God hath said enough in his Word to stop the mouths of such <HI>Gainsayers,</HI> and I am apt to think that one main Reason why they call these <HI>weap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, carnal weapons,</HI> is because they be not in their own Hands, though if there, I fear they would be <HI>carnal weapons</HI> indeed, and it may be carnally and cruelly used; Witness the Stories of others that have pretended to like Prin∣ciples, till opportunity hath given them Advantage to discover themselves.</P>
<P>Indeed the first Warr that we read of in Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI> Gen. 14. was begun by those that we have no ground to believe were any of the best of men, yet that gave occasion to <HI>Abraham</HI> that <HI>holy, rightsous, Pattern-Believer</HI> to draw the Sword in the same Chapter, having before hand prudently trained up his Servants unto <HI>Military Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses,</HI> that they might be fit to go forth to Warr when Providence should put them upon it. (<HI>ver. 14.</HI>) The word there ren∣dred [<HI>trained</HI>] doth not only signifie trained up in <HI>Religious Educa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,</HI> as it is used, <HI>Prov. 22.6.</HI> But also initiated or instructed in <HI>Military skill,</HI> as the Scope of the place, besides the Sense of the word seems plainly and fair∣ly to carry it. So that as <HI>Abraham</HI> was the <HI>Great Pattern Believer,</HI> so he was in this Chapter the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Pattern-Souldier, exemplary</HI> and <HI>imitable</HI> both in training up his men before hand to have them ready, and also in leading them forth to actual Service when there was occasion. Nor need any of the Children of <HI>Abraham</HI> (as all Believers are) doubt to imitate (rather they are to account themselves obliged to imitate) their <HI>Father</HI> in that which is so many wayes warranted, and wherein he was so <HI>prospered</HI> and <HI>succeeded,</HI> and upon his return from which so <HI>extraordinarily blessed,</HI> as you find in the same Chapter. Sure the Lords so blessing him upon such a <HI>warlike Exploit</HI> inti∣mates his acceptance of him therein, and helps to <HI>warrantize</HI> the like practise to us.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>David was a man after Gods own heart,</HI> and yet <HI>a man of warr,</HI> 2 Sam. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.8. Had his <HI>mighty men</HI> trained to Service, about him, made a Law in <HI>Iudah</HI> thereabout, 2 Sam. 1.18. that there should be <HI>Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng-daies</HI> (as we call them) Times set apart to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each the <HI>Art</HI> of Souldiery. The <HI>Bow</HI> being a <HI>principal Instrument</HI> then used in Warr, is <HI>Synechdochically</HI> put for every weapon of warr, and their learning the use of that, intends their Skill in the whole Art. <HI>Solomon</HI> in his best dayes, and before his Apostacy, though a <HI>King of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace,</HI> yet provided for Warr, and so did <HI>Asa,</HI> 2 Chron. 14 6, 7, 8. he took the Advantage of the peaceable dayes they had to fit themselves for warr. So they are commended for their ability to keep Rank, and use the Sword with both hands, <HI>1 Chron. 12.38.</HI></P>

to their <HI>Commendation,</HI> and sure they had not that Skill <HI>naturally,</HI> but by use and Exercise.</P>
<P>You find also that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> when about the wall of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had his <HI>Fighting Tool</HI> in one hand, and <HI>working Tool</HI> in the other, <HI>Chap. 4.17.</HI></P>
<P>Let me add a place or two out of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> Luk. 3 14 when the <HI>Souldiers</HI> came to <HI>John Baptist</HI> and asked what they should do, he bids them not lay down their Arms, but use them well, not <HI>violently, injuriously,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and to be content with their wages,</HI> though to take wages, i. e the <HI>wages</HI> or <HI>Stipend</HI> of <HI>Souldiers,</HI> though to do the work of Souldiers, else it had not been lawful or rational to take wages, though the Calling &amp; Imployment of <HI>Souldi∣ers</HI> is lawful. Some in our dayes would have said, man thou maiest not <HI>Fight,</HI> thou must not meddle with that <HI>Profession</HI> any more, it is not lawful for thee to be a <HI>Souldier,</HI> but the <HI>Baptist</HI> knew better.</P>
<P>The <HI>godly Centurion</HI> that had not his <HI>Fellow</HI> for a Believer in <HI>Israel,</HI> did not lay down his place, give up his <HI>Commission</HI> or <HI>disband</HI> his <HI>Souldiers</HI> (which doubtless he would have done if it had not been lawful to be a Souldier) no, but he keeps up good Discipline among them, maintains his <HI>Authority,</HI> and ha's them at his <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k,</HI> Math. 8.8, 10. You read also of <HI>Armies</HI> following <HI>Christ on white Horses,</HI> Rev. 19.14. <HI>I</HI> might further urge it from the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature. Self Preservation</HI> is one of the <HI>Prime Dictates</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI> It is ri∣vetted into our very <HI>Beings</HI> as <HI>Creatures</HI> to preserve our selves, we must <HI>un∣creature</HI> our selves if we renounce that. Sure God hath not given to all other Creatures an <HI>Instinct</HI> to preserve themselves, (some by <HI>hiding,</HI> some by <HI>flying,</HI> others by <HI>Fighting,</HI> &amp;c.) and in the mean Time left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a <HI>tame Fool</HI> to be a <HI>Prey</HI> to his <HI>Adversary.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> speaks the same thing, for it doth most strongly and <HI>indispensibly</HI> put upon the use of means. <HI>Abraham</HI> could (for ought I know) believe as much as any man alive, even <HI>in hope against hope,</HI> and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> could not <HI>believe</HI> Lot <HI>out of Captivity,</HI> (though he could <HI>believe</HI> Isaac <HI>out of the ashes</HI>) but rather chose to use men and means to <HI>Fight him out</HI>▪ This <HI>Great Believer</HI> was a <HI>great Souldier.</HI> It is true, the main Security of the Believers is their <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> but still in his own way, <HI>viz.</HI> in the use of means where God gives opportunity, without doing of which you cannot trust God. He knows not the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> that knows not the <HI>activity</HI> of it in the use of means. <HI>Faith</HI> is a most <HI>Active, obedient Grace.</HI> You spoil its acting while you are not found in a way of <HI>Obedience.</HI> In putting it out of that way you <HI>ham-string, enervate</HI> it, <HI>clipp</HI> its <HI>wings,</HI> and then how can you ex∣pect it should <HI>goe, act, fly?</HI></P>
<P>We might argue also from the <HI>unreasonable, envious, quarrelsome, injuri∣ous, cruel,</HI> yea, <HI>murtherous Spirit</HI> that is in <HI>sinful man,</HI> which will not be kept from doing wrong but by such means. Were all men <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>Religious,
<PB N="33" REF="000193_0036_0FA3170CC7B66D20" MS="y"/>
Conscientious</HI> and <HI>pious,</HI> then <HI>beat their Swords into plow-Shares,</HI> &amp;c. The com∣mand of God, and the <HI>Royal Law</HI> of <HI>doing as we would be done by,</HI> would secure all mens persons and Estates; but <HI>all men have not Faith,</HI> nor <HI>love,</HI> nor <HI>obedi∣ence,</HI> nor do they use <HI>Conscience</HI> neither. The <HI>enmity between the seed of the Serpent and the woman,</HI> which appeared betimes in the Example of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> and inclined the one to <HI>Hatred</HI> and <HI>Opposition,</HI> should prompt the other to <HI>self-preservation</HI> and the means of it.</P>
<P>What <HI>Warr</HI> is <HI>lawful</HI> and when, I shall not dispute, but that a <HI>Defensive Warr</HI> is <HI>lawful</HI> is beyond dispute, to <HI>Fight</HI> for the <HI>Citties</HI> of our God, as <HI>2 Sam. 10.12.</HI> or to recover ours out of the <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>violence,</HI> as <HI>Gen. 14.</HI> So <HI>Jephthah</HI> went to <HI>Warr</HI> against those that would have put him out of the <HI>Inheritance which God had given him,</HI> Jude 11. and he was one of those that acted in <HI>Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> Heb. 11.31, 33, 34. together with others there mentioned, while▪ <HI>subduing Kingdomes, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing valiant in F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, and turning to flight the Armies of the Aliens.</HI> Christs forbidding to <HI>resist evil,</HI> Math. 5.30. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> refers to private persons in a <HI>way</HI> of <HI>Revenge,</HI> vid. <HI>Perkins in loc.</HI> Nor had <HI>Peter</HI> a Call at that Time to <HI>resist Authority</HI> in that way, <HI>Math. 26.52.</HI> who was therefore bidden to put up his <HI>Sword,</HI> and they are threatned to <HI>perish with the Sword</HI> that do <HI>unseasonably</HI> and <HI>injuriously</HI> use it. Not but that the <HI>Civil Power</HI> may, and ought draw the <HI>Sword</HI> in Case. It's true, we read of a <HI>Curse</HI> against them that <HI>delight in Warr,</HI> Psal. 68.30. and no less are they <HI>cur∣sed</HI> that come not to the <HI>Help of the Lord against the mighty,</HI> Jud. 5. and do but only <HI>beat the Air,</HI> and not bath their Swords in Blood when they do come, <HI>Jer. 48.10.</HI> That then is the first word of Encouragement to you in your work, <HI>viz.</HI> that you have good warrant, <HI>Scripture warrant</HI> for your <HI>Training dayes</HI> and <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> and that the Lord doth <HI>Countenance</HI> and <HI>require</HI> these <HI>preparations,</HI> that you may be ready to serve the Lord and his people, when he calls you thereunto.</P>
<P N="2">2. A second word of Encouragement which I may add, and that from my Text, is that <HI>Great</HI> is the <HI>Honour</HI> which the Lord puts upon you as <HI>Military persons,</HI> especially in such a <HI>Capacity</HI> as those that do willingly give up them∣selves to the Service of God in such <HI>Exercises,</HI> and that not only in that he speaks of the Saints, (<HI>the excellent ones upon Earth</HI>) in your language, but also in that the Lord is often in Scripture calling himself <HI>the Lord of Hosts,</HI> so also <HI>a Man of Warr,</HI> Exod. 15.3. The Son of God also is <HI>Captain-General,</HI> (as <HI>Mediatour</HI>) under his <HI>Father,</HI> see <HI>Psal. 45.1—5.</HI> Besides the most <HI>eminent</HI> of the Saints all along have been Souldiers, (I mean properly so) <HI>Father Abraham</HI> was free of the <HI>Souldiers-Hall,</HI> and had an <HI>Artillery Garden</HI> at his house, <HI>three hundred</HI> and <HI>eighteen</HI> in his <HI>trained Band,</HI> Gen. 14.14. <HI>David</HI> in like manner, <HI>2 Sam. 17.8.</HI> Indeed, <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and all the Saints upon Earth are of your <HI>Company,</HI> which is much for your <HI>Honour.</HI> Again, much of
<PB N="34" REF="000193_0037_0FA3170D85AF0C30"/>
the Scripture is spent about Souldiers, and Souldiery. How many <HI>Chapters</HI> in Sacred Writ are no other but so many <HI>Lists</HI> of the <HI>Names</HI> of Souldiers that have been in <HI>former Ages,</HI> and how many more are spent in reciting the <HI>noble Exploits</HI> and <HI>valorous Attempts</HI> and <HI>Enterprizes</HI> of Souldiers? Twice over in two several <HI>Chapters,</HI> viz. <HI>2</HI> Sam. 23. and <HI>1 Chron. 11.</HI> are the Names of <HI>Davids</HI> choice, expert Souldiers, called his <HI>Worthies,</HI> set down. Besides a <HI>large Catalogue</HI> of the <HI>mighty men</HI> that helped <HI>David</HI> is exprest, <HI>1 Chron. 12.</HI> the <HI>expert Commanders</HI> and able Souldiers that came in to them, till they be∣came a <HI>great Host</HI> like the <HI>Host of God,</HI> ver 22. Now to have such <HI>frequent</HI> and Honourable mention made of Souldiers in the Word of God, and to have so <HI>considerable</HI> a part of it so spent, is a <HI>great Honour</HI> to Souldiers, and shews the great delight that <HI>the Lord of Hosts</HI> hath in his Souldiery, it tells us that they are persons <HI>whom the Lord delights to Honour,</HI> And Honour is a good En∣couragement and Spurr to a Souldier. Your Imployment is no <HI>base, low, In∣feriour Imployment,</HI> but one <HI>highly honoured by the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Souldiers, know that the Lord hath put a great deal of <HI>Honour</HI> upon you, for which you are exceedingly beholden to him; carry it <HI>humbly, thankfully,</HI> and <HI>serviceably</HI> toward God under the <HI>Honour</HI> He conferrs upon you. See that you <HI>Honour</HI> him, who thus <HI>honoureth</HI> you. If <HI>God will Honour those that Honour him,</HI> (1 Sam. 2.30.) Then surely those should <HI>honour him whom he honours.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A third word of Encouragement I shall take from the great use that God hath all along made of <HI>Military men</HI> in his Church. To be useful and ser∣viceable is an <HI>Honour,</HI> (for the <HI>more serviceable</HI> the <HI>more Honourable</HI>) espe∣cially to be so <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>immediately serviceable</HI> to <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Church,</HI> as Souldiers have been, yea, are, and shall be even to the very last. And this is a further Encouragement. Though properly the Lord needs no help <HI>against the mighty,</HI> yet he uses them, and one Reason is for the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Encou∣ragement</HI> of them that he uses. Christ may make use of you to be great bles∣sings in the places where you live. It is a <HI>Blessing</HI> to a people to have <HI>mighty men</HI> and <HI>men of Warr</HI> among them, as appears, because it is a great judgement to have such taken away from them, <HI>Isai. 3.</HI> Be encouraged then, for you are useful, and may be made <HI>great Blessings,</HI> and that is a <HI>blessed thing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Great is the Affection that God ha's for such, especially for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem that offer themselves willingly unto that service.</HI> (provided that their Hearts be right therein, for the Service and Glory of God,) Gods heart is toward such as <HI>Deborah's</HI> was, <HI>Iudg. 5.9.</HI> Now that Gods heart is toward you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> presence with you, while you are with, and for Him, is a very <HI>comfortable, heartening,</HI> and <HI>encouraging word</HI> to be spoken at the <HI>Head</HI> of an <HI>Army,</HI> see <HI>2 Chron. 15.2.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The main Scope of the whole that I have spoken may be improved by way of Encouragement, <HI>viz.</HI> that you are both much inlightned about the Na∣ture of, and furthered in the managing of your <HI>General Calling</HI> as Christians by
<PB N="35" REF="000193_0038_0FA3170E45C8D5C0" MS="y"/>
your being Souldiers. As your Christianity will help your Souldiery, so be sure your Souldiery (if the fault be not your own) will noteably help your Christianity. Every <HI>Training-day</HI> may be a <HI>learning day</HI> to you, while trai∣ning you may be working for God and Christ, and for your Souls too. If your Soul-work may go forward amain while you are <HI>exercising</HI> your <HI>Arms,</HI> it can∣not but be a <HI>great Encouragement</HI> to them that know they have Souls, and know the worth of them. You that are Souldiers (as I have already hinted) are eminently beholden to God in that he is <HI>full, large,</HI> and <HI>pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticular</HI> in Spi∣ritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lizing your Calling, in putting so much of Heaven thereinto, that if you will seriously attend, you cannot but find it. Truly our going with an Earthly mind about our Earthly work, with a <HI>common-Heart</HI> about our <HI>common Im∣ployment,</HI> is that which spoils us in it, and makes us lose the <HI>best Good,</HI> even the <HI>spiritual Good</HI> that might be gotten thereby.</P>
<P>Unto this word of Encouragement, I shall add a few words of Advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Propose right Ends to your selves in these Exercises.</HI> There are good and useful Ends of them, let those <HI>good Ends</HI> be your Ends. If your Ends are not right, you may be Souldiers but scarce Christians. Now the <HI>Great End</HI> of all our <HI>Vndertakings,</HI> and of this in special, is <HI>the Glory of God. Whatsoever you do, do it to the Glory of God,</HI> (1 Cor. 10.31.) Let the Service of God and his Church be the mark you aim at, the white which you desire and endeavour to hitt, which if you do you shall be sure to get the prize. Had we never read ought of <HI>Ioab</HI> save that one Speech, 2 Sam. 10.12. we should have in Charity accounted him not only a Souldier, (as we say) every Inch of him, but a pi∣ous man also; However he deserves to be <HI>Chronicled</HI> for it, and <HI>imitated</HI> in it. [<HI>For our people and for the Citties of our God</HI>] Come not into the Field to shew your Bravery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but come to do Service, to learn Skill, and so pre∣pare for further Service. Do not Exercise that you may know, or be known to know, but that you may do, and do for the people and Cause of God and Christ, for whom to shed your Blood, is the best way to preserve it, to lay down your Lives, the best way to save them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Then be serious in your work,</HI> as those that have so high an End, and mean to do your utmost to attain that End; If this be your End, then do not go about your work like men <HI>that beat the Air.</HI> I may use the Apostles Ex∣pressions, and propose his Example to you, (For your ultimate End in your <HI>particular Calling</HI> is the same with his in his <HI>General Calling</HI> and your Acti∣vity in every Business and in this especially, is to have the same Common End) <HI>so run that you may obtain the prize,</HI> and so labour not as <HI>uncertainly,</HI> and so meet, Exercise, train, (as you call it] <HI>not as those that beat the Air.</HI> God makes use of your Calling as Souldiers to set forth the Calling of Christi∣ans by, a Calling wherein the greatest accurateness, exactness, Care, Skill, Diligence is to be used: then so do your work, so mind your Business, that as
<PB N="36" REF="000193_0039_0FA3170F05B578B8" MS="y"/>
Religion <HI>honours</HI> your <HI>Calling,</HI> so your exactness and compleatness in your <HI>Calling</HI> may <HI>honour</HI> that Religion which you profess, and which <HI>honours</HI> your <HI>Profession.</HI></P>
<P>You called me hither to speak to you a word in the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> then, <HI>In the Name of the Lord</HI> I say to you in the words of my Text, again, be not like those <HI>that beat the Air,</HI> and in the words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Eccles. 9.10. <HI>what ever your Hand findeth to do, do it with your might.</HI></P>
<P>You <HI>much Interest</HI> or <HI>concern</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in your <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> you <HI>Invocate</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of God in the morning when you come together, you desire something to be spoken to you <HI>in the Name of God</HI> upon these Occasions, then, in his <HI>Name,</HI> I beseech you to hear what is now spoken in his <HI>Name, viz.</HI> Play the <HI>men,</HI> not the <HI>children,</HI> not the <HI>Fools.</HI> To pray for the presence of God when you go about a Business, and then to play when you are at it, not to be <HI>thorough</HI> and <HI>serious</HI> in it, is to pray God to come among you to see you play the <HI>children</HI> or <HI>Fools,</HI> as if the <HI>infinitely holy and wise God</HI> would be <HI>pleased with the Sacrifice of Fools,</HI> Eccles. 5.1. (which Text though it relates principally to worship, yet it holds by proportion in any thing that is called serving of God.) To supplicate Gods presence, and then to take no Care to do ought worthy of his presence, to desire God to look on, when you have nothing but a <HI>vain Heart,</HI> and a <HI>slighty, heedless Carriage</HI> to shew him, how near this comes to <HI>mocking of God</HI> you may <HI>sadly Consider.</HI> God is <HI>a man of Warr,</HI> and delights to be among such, to deign them his pre∣sence when they desire it, but <HI>I</HI> tell you he hath a <HI>Curious</HI> and <HI>skilful eye,</HI> and therefore it becomes you to behave your selves as becomes his presence. I have seen some <HI>Artillery men</HI> as really <HI>serious</HI> when they have been at training as when they have been at prayer, and so to be is very pleasing both to God and man.</P>
<P>I shall make bold to insist a little upon this Direction; Here is a <HI>Great As∣sembly</HI> and <HI>many Souldiers</HI> are present from all parts, it may not therefore be amiss and unseasonable to give something by way of <HI>General Direction</HI> unto what is <HI>regular,</HI> and of <HI>Reprehension</HI> to what is otherwise, in this matter now before us.</P>
<P>It is too <HI>palpable</HI> and <HI>obvious</HI> not to be taken notice of, that there is a great deal of <HI>slightiness</HI> and <HI>frothiness</HI> in <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> or in men, while <HI>Con∣versant</HI> in those <HI>Exercises</HI>; Your <HI>ordinary Training dayes</HI> are accounted <HI>Re∣creation-dayes, play-dayes, sporting-dayes,</HI> and they are oft, and by many, spent in <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>Licentiousness,</HI> as if <HI>vain merriment, Idleness, Voluptuous∣ness</HI> and <HI>Excess</HI> were the work of the day, as if there would be no <HI>reckoning</HI> for so many dayes in a year <HI>unprofitably spent,</HI> nay, as if there would be no <HI>reckoning</HI> for mens taking occasion to <HI>make Provision for the Flesh</HI> at such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when they should be Serving God, not with their <HI>Bodies</HI> only, but with
<PB N="37" REF="000193_0040_0FA3170FC74E0690" MS="y"/>
their <HI>Spirits</HI> also. But suppose there be not, (as I hope among your selves there is not, you pretend to higher things, and I hope better things of you though I thus speak) I say, suppose there be not any of these <HI>Extravagancies,</HI> yet now will you be able to Answer for <HI>bare non Proficiency,</HI> and for <HI>sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ness</HI> and <HI>heedlessness,</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> of it Know, that when you have <HI>given up your Names</HI> unto such a work▪ then to neglect <HI>Attendance</HI> either not to come at all, or to come late to study <HI>Excuses</HI> for your <HI>neglect,</HI> to be among your <HI>sheep, ships,</HI> &amp;c. as they, <HI>Iud. 5.16, 17.</HI> you may possibly save your <HI>Fine</HI> among men, but with God will not come off so easily. Or if you do come, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Season, so as not to be <HI>prickt</HI> for want of Answering to your <HI>Names,</HI> and spend the day in the Service, and yet not so <HI>seriously intensly, heedfully,</HI> as to make some <HI>Addition</HI> to your <HI>skin</HI> or <HI>Dexterity</HI> by every dayes expence, how will you be able when called to account for that day, (and every day is a <HI>Talent</HI> and must be reckoned for to say, Lord thus much gained.</P>
<P>Oh let not Souldiers be like <HI>school-Boyes,</HI> as not to care how little they have for their <HI>Mony,</HI> how little Time at their Books, or how little good they get in that Time. Be not <HI>ever Training</HI> and never <HI>gaining</HI> any <HI>skill</HI> by the <HI>Exer∣cise.</HI> Better stay at home and work, then come into the <HI>Field</HI> and play, to spend Time and get no <HI>skill,</HI> nor perhaps aim to get any, will not pass for well spending of Time. You <HI>Artillery men</HI> should be <HI>Artists</HI> indeed, each of you Able to <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll</HI> a <HI>Company,</HI> to lead an <HI>Army,</HI> able to keep <HI>Rank</HI>▪ your selves, and teach others to do so too, your being an <HI>Artillery Company</HI> speaks that you are, and aim to be somewhat more then <HI>Ordinary.</HI> And truly you will never do as you ought to do, till you make Conscience of doing as you ought. <HI>Conscience</HI> of <HI>duty</HI> will make you <HI>attend duty,</HI> and be <HI>intense</HI> in your <HI>Attendance,</HI> the way to be <HI>succ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssful</HI> also.</P>
<P>It's a <HI>Good Rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in any <HI>Business,</HI> (and surely in yours) to argue thus, ei∣ther this is <HI>Gods work</HI> that I am about, or not, if not, lay i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aside, give over, take your <HI>Names</HI> out of the <HI>List,</HI> wholly <HI>withd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw,</HI> appear no more; but if it be <HI>Gods work,</HI> then <HI>do it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h your might,</HI> remembring the <HI>workless grave</HI> to∣ward which you are <HI>marching,</HI> as also the danger you are in of that <HI>dreadful Sentence</HI> against the <HI>deceitful dealer</HI> in Gods Service, <HI>Ier. 48.10.</HI> You are there∣fore to be <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>serious</HI> in your <HI>deportment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gravity</HI> in a Souldier especial∣ly while in Service, is very commendable.

Then mind your Business, as those that know it is <HI>Gods business,</HI> mind your work as those that have a mind to work, and to be gaining by their work.</P>
<P>Mind and attend to the word of Command, which you cannot do with <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣zing, smokeing,</HI> and <HI>chatting away</HI> this Time; want of mens giving up them∣selves to the work when they are at it, because they do not <HI>Hoc agere,</HI> nor give heed to what is commanded, and so by them to be done, I say, this is the Cause why often Times they are so <HI>unbandy</HI> at their Business, and so <HI>unhand∣some</HI> in performing their <HI>postures,</HI> do not keep <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>File,</HI> are routed in their <HI>marches, Counter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>marches, doublings, wheelings,</HI> all in a <HI>baddle</HI> and <HI>ridi∣culously disordered. Heedlessness</HI> in work makes <HI>confused work.</HI></P>
<P>Excuse my plainness with you, I cannot charge any of your selves upon my own <HI>Knowledge</HI> with these disorders that have been reproved, if any are guil∣ty, those that deserve, may very well patiently bear Reproof; those that do not deserve it, may well be quiet, while others are reproved that do, and may also take it as a word of <HI>Caution</HI> to themselves, yea, and <HI>Commendation</HI> too; for a <HI>Reprehension</HI> to the Guilty is <HI>implicitely</HI> a <HI>Commendation</HI> to them that are otherwise. But thus be in good earnest.</P>
<P>Perhaps your Exercises may look like <HI>beating the Air,</HI> because you are not called forth to real Service, but know, that <HI>preparation</HI> for real Service is real Service, and if you do nothing but <HI>beat the Air</HI> now, you will be like to do lit∣tle toward beating your Enemy then. Act so in your preparation, that it may appear you have not been trained up for nothing. We read of the Enemies being <HI>skilful to destroy,</HI> Ezek 21.21. which speaks need of our being <HI>skilful to defend.</HI> Study to be <HI>mighty men,</HI> and <HI>men of Warr,</HI> (as <HI>Isai. 3.</HI>) the <HI>Bul∣warks</HI> of the place while you live, that you may be as they, <HI>2 Sam. 1.17. ho∣nourably Epitaphed,</HI> and <HI>bitterly lamented</HI> when you die. Be <HI>ambitious</HI> of being like to those who are for their <HI>skill</HI> and <HI>valour</HI> recorded in Scripture as <HI>wor∣thy</HI> of <HI>Imitation,</HI> see. <HI>1 Chron. 5.18.</HI> and <HI>12.8, 21,, 30, 32, 33, 38.</HI></P>
<P>You know not how soon the Lord and his people may have occasion for your Help <HI>against the Mighty.</HI> It is true God hath been very kind to <HI>New-England,</HI> no breaking in, nor leading forth, <HI>nor complaining in our Streets,</HI> this last year also, this <HI>dangerous year,</HI> this <HI>threatning year,</HI> so like to prove a <HI>bloody</HI> one to us, as well as to many other places, I say, this year is you see fairly gone off the <HI>Stage.</HI> We had the last week our <HI>Great Solemnity,</HI> our Beginning of a <HI>New Year,</HI> or <HI>New Years day,</HI> wherein we had opportunity of setting up our <HI>Eben Ezer</HI> and saying, <HI>hitherto God hath helped us.</HI> We may bless God and say with him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55.18. <HI>He hath delivered our souls in peace from the Battel
<PB N="39" REF="000193_0042_0FA31711473C62F0" MS="y"/>
that was against us, for there were many with us.</HI> It is true also, that this year be¦gins with the Tideings of Peace, we have had the <HI>Dove</HI> sent in among us with an <HI>Olive leaf</HI> to give us some intimation of the <HI>Abatement of the flood,</HI> &amp; Hopes that it may not reach us; And the <HI>God of peace</HI> grant that there may be <HI>Peace</HI> indeed, a well grounded and settled Peace: Peace with God first, as the Cause, and then with men as the Effect, peace with Truth, peace with holi∣ness, and that will be a <HI>firm, long-lasting, everlasting peace.</HI></P>
<P>But yet for all this, I could not see Cause to preach on that Text, <HI>Isai. 2.4. Beat your Swords into Plow-shares,</HI> &amp;c. I think rather that of <HI>Luk. 22.36.</HI> or <HI>2</HI> Sam. 1.18. or <HI>Ioel. 3 10.</HI> would be more suitable. I fear the Nations have not forgotten Warr as yet, nor will they unlearn Warr wholly, till they do unlearn Sin and Lust more, <HI>from whence their Warrs come,</HI> till pride lower and strike, the Warrs will never end. While there is Flesh as well as Spirit in the new man, there will be Warrs within; and while there are carnal men as well as Spiritual in the World there will be Warrs without. Therefore while we <HI>pray for the peace of</HI> Jerusalem, we are to provide for the Wars that will be made against <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> as knowing that the Church on Earth is the <HI>Church-Militant,</HI> Jerusalem <HI>sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be a quiet habitation,</HI> but we must not <HI>antedate</HI> Gods work. That Time shall come, but in the mean Time we must handle our Arms, as well as Ploughs.</P>
<P><HI>Anti-Christ must Fall,</HI> and the Enemies of the Church shall be overcome by a material Sword, as well as by a Spiritual one. The Prayers of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ints have long cried, their teares have cried, their blood hath cried, the bow∣ells of Christ have long yearned over them, and himself hath long waited to to see his Enemies made <HI>his Footstool,</HI> and therefore sure it cannot be long. And what an Honour will it be to be called to that work, and dexterous at it when called to it. When <HI>Abraham</HI> was called to follow God in a way of Reformation, &amp; God had in that way blessed him outwardly too, he could not but know that the Enemies about him would envy him not only as Religious, but as prospering outwardly in a Profession of Religion, which might give him just occasion to train up his Family to Military Discipline, as we read, <HI>Gen. 14, 14.</HI> that he might be in a posture ready to receive them if Occasion should be. We in this Wilderness, both on the account of our Profession and Prosperity under it, have long been, and still are an Eye-sore to the Ad∣versary, there are, that are consulting to undermine us, and we should be en∣deavouring to secure our selves, not only by p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying, that no foot of pride may come against us, nor hand of violence move us, but also, if any such should come by preparing before hand to give them such a Reception as may discover, that as we were <HI>fore-warned,</HI> so also <HI>fore-armed.</HI></P>
<P>Great are the things that a Religious people have to defend, <HI>viz.</HI> besides their Lives, Liberties, Relations, Estates, &amp;c. the Name, honour and worship
<PB N="40" REF="000193_0043_0FA317120591D3B8" MS="y"/>
of God, the <HI>pleasant things</HI> of his House, those <HI>Great Betrustments</HI> which the world cannot boast of, and are more worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the world, and hence they should labour to furnish themselves both with Skil and ability to defend and maintain what God ha's given them, or else they will act both <HI>irrationally</HI> for themselves, and <HI>unthankfully</HI> toward God that hath so <HI>priviledged</HI> them. The Faith and the <HI>pleasant things of Zion</HI> are worth contending for, and that not with the tongue and hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only, but with the hands and Sword also when God calls thereunto.</P>
<P>Great also is the Advantage that a people get by being expert for Warr, their being so, may be a means to prevent <HI>Warr.</HI> The report of a people's be∣ing a <HI>warlike people</HI> may be of singular use to them, the same of their skill may be a means to prevent their using it. Whereas the Security of a people invites an Enemy, and renders them lyable to be a <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> see <HI>Judg▪ 18 7, 8, 9.</HI></P>
<P>Times of peace are Times to prepare for Warr, and if we miss it in our pre∣paration, we shall be <HI>fearfully hurried</HI> and <HI>blundred</HI> when we come to action, we cannot promise our selves to be saved then, unless we be diligent in prepa∣ration now. If Warr comes, the comfort of having done our duty, and the profit of being in a readiness, will make amends for the trouble; if it comes not, our peace will bear the Charge of our preparation. Thus be <HI>intense</HI> about, and <HI>serious</HI> in these <HI>Exercises,</HI> make Conscience of gaining Skill, and of spen∣ding Time so as may best conduce to that End. So do in these as well as other matters, as you would be glad to have done when an Enemy comes, yea, when Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall come. Train as in the sight of an Enemy, with whom you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Fight.</HI> Train as doing Service to Christ, and in the sight of Christ, who will one day reward every dayes Service, and this dayes Service, if you diligently and obediently serve him therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Be Spiritual and He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venly in all your Military Exercises, that you may be good Christians as well as good Souldiers.</HI> It is good <HI>policy</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> for <HI>pious Rulers</HI> to command and Countenance the <HI>training</HI> up those that are under their <HI>Government</HI> unto <HI>Military Skill,</HI> so that if need be, they may be able to speak with the <HI>Enemy</HI> in the <HI>Gate,</HI> and under their <HI>approbation</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> you list and Exercise your selves in these Affairs.

<P><HI>Make good your Leaders Grownd</HI>] A <HI>seasonable word</HI> of Command for the <HI>rising Generation</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> Could we be with God as our <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> were, he would be with us as he was with our <HI>Fathers.</HI> Did not our <HI>Fathers do Justice and Judgement,</HI> and it was well with them? <HI>Jer. 22.15, 16.</HI> To imitate them will be our <HI>prudence,</HI> and <HI>weal.

<P>The <HI>Beat</HI> of the <HI>Drum,</HI> the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpet</HI> is of <HI>great Vse</HI> to <HI>Souldi∣ers,</HI> and to <HI>Christians</HI> as much, Know, that God also calls you to hearken to the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpet,</HI> Jer 6.17. <HI>viz.</HI> his voice in his word, and that espe∣cially in the publick dispensing of it by his <HI>Watch-men,</HI> whose work it is to <HI>lift up their voice as a Trumpet.</HI> Then when the <HI>Trumpet</HI> is <HI>blown,</HI> do you <HI>attend,</HI> Amos 3 6. yea, and bless God that it is not your portion to dwell there, where the <HI>Trumpet</HI> gives an <HI>uncertain Sound,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.8. <HI>File-Leaders</HI> (as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l as <HI>chief Leaders</HI>) see how you lead, have a Care to go right, lest you mislead others, &amp; their <HI>miscarriages</HI> be charged to your <HI>account.</HI> The Examples of <HI>Lea∣ding men</HI> are <HI>leading Examples,</HI> and if bad Exampl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s then <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sleading</HI> ones too. <HI>Peters Example</HI> before others, was in a Sense <HI>Coercive</HI> or <HI>compelling</HI> to them. <HI>Gal▪ 2.13,</HI> 14.</P>
<P>As <HI>Souldiers</HI> you set your <HI>Watch,</HI> and place your <HI>Sentinels,</HI> and I am sure, as <HI>Christians</HI> you have as much need, while you are in the <HI>Enemies Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he

<P>When you are commanded to <HI>Charge, present, give fire,</HI> it is a shame and trouble to you to <HI>miss Fire,</HI> or make only <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse Fire,</HI> or when a mark is before you not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: it think then how it offends Christ, <HI>disadvantages</HI> you now, and will grieve you another day, if the result of all your <HI>Profession</HI> and <HI>preten∣ded preparation</HI> hath only been a <HI>little false Fire,</HI> a <HI>form of Godliness</HI> an <HI>empty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ame,</HI> Then be sure to be well f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xed, and take <HI>good Aim,</HI> be not like a de∣ceitfull Bow, do not shoot at Rovers, lest you miss the Mark and lose the great Prize, which as Professors of the Name of Christ, you pretend to be labouring after</P>
<P>In Summe it will be your Honour as Souldiers to be accurate and punctual in all your postures and Exercises; and it will your great Advantage as Christi∣an, if you can (and you see if you will you may) turn all your Exercises into Spiritual and special use.</P>
<P>Whether any of you may ever be called as <HI>Souldiers,</HI> to make matter to fill up the <HI>Pages</HI> of future <HI>Histories</HI> with your <HI>warlike Exploits</HI> &amp; <HI>valorous deeds</HI> in taking of <HI>Cities, overrunning Countries,</HI> &amp;c. we know not; but if you be good <HI>Souldiers</HI> of Christ in the <HI>Spiritual warfare,</HI> that is the way to <HI>lasting honour.</HI> He that <HI>rules</HI> his own <HI>Spirit,</HI> is better, and shall be more <HI>honoured</HI> and <HI>rewar∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> then he that <HI>win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> a <HI>City,</HI> Prov. 16.32.</P>
<P>Only this you must all know that both as <HI>Souldiers</HI> &amp; <HI>Christians</HI> your strength &amp; Success lies in <HI>the Lord of Hosts,</HI> not in your selves.

<P>But perhaps some may think that I have <HI>Charged</HI> too farr and that it is Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>draw off,</HI> I shall therefore immediately <HI>discharge</HI> you of your <HI>present Atten∣dance</HI>; Only that I may not leave you within fight of <HI>Death</HI> without a <HI>Prayer</HI> for you, give me leave in so many words, to close with my Desires on your be∣half▪ (<HI>&amp; sam nil nisi vota supersunt</HI>)</P>

and increase both your <HI>Number</HI> and Skill, that he will <HI>teach your hands to Warr, and your fingers to Fight,</HI> Psal. 144.1. grant that your <HI>thoughts, words,</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> in this Affair especially, <HI>may be acceptable to him</HI>; and may you have all Incouragement and Countenance from men too.</P>
<P>That the Lord will make you all <HI>Christians,</HI> as well as <HI>Souldiers,</HI> yea, <HI>excel∣lent Christians,</HI> and <HI>accurate Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P>That if it be best for his <HI>Glory,</HI> the <HI>Common good,</HI> and your <HI>particular weal</HI>) you may not be used in any other <HI>Military way</HI> then in this that you are in, of <HI>Pre∣paration.</HI> You honour God in the use of this means of his Appointment to pre∣pare for <HI>Warr,</HI> and he can honour you by preventing any further use of this <HI>preparation.</HI></P>
<P>That if the Lord hath further occasion for you, he will make you <HI>offer your selves willingly,</HI> yea, though it be to the <HI>jeoparding of your Lives to the Death in the High places of the Field,</HI> Judg. 5.2, 9, 18.</P>
<P>And then that <HI>the Lord of Hosts</HI> himself will encourage your Hearts, <HI>strengthen your hands and cover your Heads in the day of Battel,</HI> Psal. 140.7.

<P>Finally, for your selves, and all of us here present, (your <HI>Fellow-Souldiers</HI> in the <HI>Christian warfare</HI>) let us beg that when we come to lay down our Arms at the <HI>Graves side,</HI> and there to take our <HI>final discharge</HI> from all kind of Warr, we may be able each for himself to say with some of our <HI>latest Breath,</HI> in the lan∣guage of that <HI>Good old Souldier of Christ,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.7. <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith.
