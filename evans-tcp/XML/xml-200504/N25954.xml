<HEAD>AN ORATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS and FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have convened to celebrate the epoch of our country's freedom. On this au∣spicious day, our fathers rose in concert, and declared us free and independent. To support the generous resolve, they pledged their "lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honour." Pla∣ced in a dignified, though responsible situation, they proclaimed to the universe a decree, sanc∣tioned by the smile of Heaven: the attentive universe approved, and well might it approve; for thou, O Liberty! didst then begin, wide as creation, to "breathe thy spirit; to exalt, illume, inspire the human race: and may thy vital rays o'er distant regions diffuse celestial light, sublime, and animate the world."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034520_0004_0FFE10D59DBDD0B8"/>WHEN on the FOURTH OF JULY, seven∣teen hundred and seventy-six, the first legisla∣tors of America, dissolved the bonds of political connexion with Great Britain; when on that solemn, that eventful occasion, the dread alter∣native was victory or death; a band of heroes came forth to vindicate their country's injured rights. Highly appreciating the blessings of li∣berty, they viewed the carnage of war as the thorn that ever accompanies the rose. With one voice they declared, that the virtuous free∣dom of a day, an hour, was of more worth, than the long ages of eternity in bondage. Im∣pressed with a glowing sense of their equal rights as men, their high unconquerable souls disdained submission. Fired with the love of liberty and virtue, disinterestedly animated with the pros∣pect of futurity, they rushed to battle, to vic∣tory or death. The hallowed shrine of free∣dom was stained with the blood of thousands, who fought for their country, and became its martyrs.—To recount the exploits of America in arms, during the revolutionary contest, would at this time be unnecessary; they are too deeply engraven on the memory of her sons ever to be forgotten. Aided by Heaven her
<PB N="5" REF="034520_0005_0FFE10D722AEC8C0"/>
exertions were crowned with success; and that very power who had violated her rights, was eventually compelled to acknowledge her in∣dependence. Hail Independence! may the day which gave thee birth, be held in grateful re∣membrance, till you bright luminary of the hea∣vens "grow dim with age, till nature sink in years."</P>
<P>WHEN the tempest of war subsided, our citi∣zens mutually congratulated each other on the pleasing return of peace. The veteran, whose nervous arm had dealt death and destruction in the well fought field, exchanged the insignia of war for the implements of domestic and social industry; and the Olive-Branch of peace was en∣twined round the laurels of victory. Peace is announced, and lo! the officers and soldiers of our revolutionary army, instantly sheath their swords and return to civil life; to the bosom of that country, whose rights they had so nobly contended to establish. Glorious example! unequalled perhaps in the annals of mankind. May we my young friends imitate their illustri∣ous patriotism at the present crisis, and be like them, soldiers in war; in peace, citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034520_0006_0FFE10DC8F123720"/>THE adoption of that constitution, under which we have the peculiar happiness to live, confirm∣ed, and gave energy to the American govern∣ment. By it the obedient subjects of the laws are protected in the full enjoyment of their pro∣perty and liberties, and the magistrate wears the sword of justice, "a terror to evil doers and a praise to them who do well" Nothing now is wanting, but the laudable exertions of our citi∣zens, to perpetuate this excellent and much ad∣mired constitution; to preserve our country free and happy, and to transmit to posterity the brightest inheritance which we enjoy.</P>
<P>TO preserve in its purity and ardor the spirit which produced our national freedom, is the ob∣ject of this day's meeting. We are called on in an especial manner this day, to place before our eyes the noble example of our fathers, that we also, when the foe shall be at hand, may be pre∣pared to sacrifice life, property and ease, in sup∣port of the well gotten glory and independence of the American name. We are called upon this day to caution ourselves against every ene∣my to the independence of our common country.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034520_0007_0FFE10DE14853838"/>LET us then remember, and let this truth be constantly present with our minds, that ty∣ranny is produced, rather from the licentiousness of the people, than from the energy of any govern∣ment: for when the liberty of the nation has degenerated into licentiousness, the bands of society are torn asunder, the ties of morality and religion are at once dissolved, and the pet∣ty and tyrannical jurisdictions of the dema∣gogues of the day precede for a short time ab∣solute ruin, or the strong hand of arbitrary pow∣er must be called in, to support the debilitated, broken and tottering state.</P>
<P>HISTORY sanctions this truth by its high autho∣rity. The Athenian legislator declared, that the stranger who intermeddled with the affairs of the republic, should be put to instant death—and if licentiousness and sedition dare to appear, exemplary would have been the punishment, Athens, the principal of confederated Greece, defied the unnumbered myriads of Persia; but the intrigues of Phillip destroyed these two sa∣lutary laws: and on that day, the glory and li∣berties of Greece perished forever. Rome furnishes many instances to the same point.
<PB N="8" REF="034520_0008_0FFE10DF9B13B3A0"/>
Whence arose the triumvirates? Whence the successive and alternate despotism of Marius and Sylla? Whence the perpetual Dictator's power? In more modern times, the same cause produced the usurpation and tyranny which marked the — Cromwell of Eng∣land. Such also is and has been the case in France, thro' a great part of the revolution, in which barbarity and cruelty have been multipli∣ed and refined to such a degree, as almost to exceed belief; to cause the astonished specta∣tor to start back with horror from the awful scene. France has been the unhappy subject, and Europe the affrighted spectator of a drama that mocks comparison.</P>
<P>OF all governments, the republican is most exposed to abuses of this kind. Experience verifies this truth in the most clear and en∣ergetic language. In our country have we seen, and still may we see, a faction avow∣edly devoted to a foreign nation, exciting strife, contention and division, in order to throw us into the arms of France: they calumniate the rulers of our choice; they propagate the most gross misrepresentations and scandalous abuse
<PB N="9" REF="034520_0009_0FFE10E26A233370"/>
against that bright SUN of Columbia, whose glory shall not fade, whose name shall triumph over time. They have sought with unremitted diligence to divide the people from their go∣vernment; but the wisdom and conspicuous pa∣triotism of those illustrious characters to whom America has delegated the authority, have hi∣therto baffled all their attempts, and the bold iniquity of their proceedings is exposed to full and public view: their insidious wiles have brought down on their heads the just resent∣ment of those honest citizens, whom they had for a while deluded.</P>
<P>IF then our government be from its nature exposed to so dangerous an evil; if our liber∣ty and independence, made dear by a memo∣rable purchase, may through our disgraceful su∣pineness be wrested from our hands; ought not all the energies of our souls to be called into action? should we not tread the monster beneath our feet? should we not unitedly oppose the hydra demon of destruction, whose malicious aim is to degrade us below the condition of men, who have learned to estimate the blessings of freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034520_0010_0FFE10E7D58D9BD0"/>BUT another subject connected with this, and of vast importance, claims our immediate atten∣tion. Fellow citizens, the enemy is at the door! the enemies of our happy country are un∣sheathing the sword against us: dark and la∣tent have been their machinations to effect our ruin. Rouse fathers! brothers! friends! rouse and defend your country's rights: gird on your swords of trust, and forbid that our nation be enslaved: proclaim aloud to the universe, that the sons of New-Jersey are prepared once more, to resume their wonted post, foremost in the field of battle. Ten thousand ruffians, the en∣gines and slaves of arbitrary France, shall bite the dust: vengeance shall be glutted with her un∣numbered victims, before NEW-JERSEY shall become the vassal of a foreign power. Blasted be the tongue that shall dare to lisp our disgrace —not a soldier of his country shall survive to blush at the recital.</P>
<P>THE French republic, regardless of the laws and usages of nations, the faith of trea∣ties, and the sacred obligations which bind na∣tions to each other, have waged the most wan∣ton and unjustifiable war on our commerce, and
<PB N="11" REF="034520_0011_0FFE10E95BDDA2F0"/>
taken captive and abused our mariners. They have sown, and endeavored to nourish the seeds of discord and sedition among us—they have insulted our government to its face—our mes∣sengers of peace and conciliation they have treated with the most studied and unheard of contempt and indignity—an enormous tribute has been demanded as the price merely of ne∣gociation—the demand has been repeated with a threat of invasion and total destruction: "Re∣member the fate of Venice; dread our diplo∣matic skill."</P>
<P>THE language and conduct of France to the United States must excite in the breast of every American, the liveliest indigna∣tion and most fixed determination to avenge his country's wrongs. He will prepare himself with alacrity for the impending contest.—The idea of submission and tame servility to the exorbi∣tant demands of France, which will increase by being granted, is too base to be entertained by free men.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034520_0012_0FFE10EAE181A300"/>AWFUL warnings are set to us by the treat∣ment which the republics of Europe have received from that haughty nation. The in∣triguing artifice of France has brought Hol∣land from the zenith of her glory to her present state of degradation and infamy. Amsterdam, once the banking house of the world, the empo∣rium of wealth and trade, has been despoiled of her treasures, robbed of her commerce exten∣sive as the ocean, and broken of her naval pow∣er once so mighty, that under the patriotc DE∣WITT, the empire of the sea was disputed with England. Belgium, the seat of elegance and the arts, must forget her former affluence. The de∣lightful plains of Italy have been drenched with blood; and Rome, mighty Rome; once mistress of the world, lies prostrate at the foot of France. Venice, the boasted Republic of Venice, that for thirteen hundred years had not acknowledged a master, has been conquered, bartered away, and her name is not now to be found among the nations of the earth. Genoa has shared the same fate of abasement and slavery. Switzerland, the historian's admiration and the poet's theme— even Switzerland has been subjugated; more in∣deed
<PB N="13" REF="034520_0013_0FFE10EDE3C1BF60"/>
by the arts and intrigues, than the arms of France. A nation divided, becomes an easy conquest; in this way France has gone on con∣quering and to conquer. And shall the United States share the ignominous fate of Holland, of Venice, of Switzerland? shall their catastrophe be ours? Forbid it Guardian Genius of America, forbid it virtue, forbid it O my country. This is the only republic remaining on earth. France has destroyed the rest: and what is France? A mi∣litary despotism, the most flagitious, the most tur∣bulent, the most portentous the world ever knew.</P>
<P>THE day is come in which we must determine whether we will continue freemen, or become slaves. And who is here that hesitates in his choice? who is here so base as to become a tri∣butary or a bondman? If any, speak, for him do we account a traitor to his country; for him do we account a wretch, unworthy a habitation in this land of freemen. To arms then gallant youth of America! your country calls you to arms. Let the example of your fathers animate you to duty. I know you scorn to disgrace the names you bear.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034520_0014_0FFE10F3645C6150"/>THE patriots who gave up their lives a sacrifice in the establishment of our indepen∣dence, like guardian angels watch over our land, and commend the conduct of those youthful warriors who are now dedicating themselves to their country; listen to, and pursue their salu∣tary admonition. Sons of Columbia! rise and defend your injured rights, preserve inviolate your freedom and independence; let not the insolent foe wrest from your hands that first blessing of heaven for which our blood was shed. Let it not be said that your counsellors have planned the safety of your country with∣out effect, that the martyrs of freedom have bled in vain; prepare like men to obey the sacred injunctions. A celebrated general once going to battle addressed his troops; "Fellow sol∣diers, behold the roof under which you drew your first breath; lo! the fields that give you nurture, the cradle in which is hushed to sleep your infant offspring, the tombs of your ances∣tors, and the bed of your wives, whom you now go forth to defend; think on these and prepare for battle." Let us also remember these pledges of our affection and attachment, and pre∣pare for the conflict.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034520_0015_0FFE10F4EBE01DE0"/>I SEE the fire of patriotism kindle in every eye—on each manly countenance is depicted indignation against the lawless agressors, who have outraged the perfidy and atrocity of Goth∣ic darkness, and Vandal barbarity: A ferocious horde whose aim is universal domination, whose means are bribery, corruption and intrigue.— No! illustrious heroes, who have fought and bled and died in defence of American free∣dom; we will not dastardly relinquish that in∣dependence, which you have purchased for us at so dear a rate: we swear to you by the swords which we inherit from our venerable sires; and in the presence of the God of na∣tions, do we this day declare, that we will not, disgracefully supine, neglect the call of our country; at that sacred call we will rally round the standard of our liberty, that led on by our illustrious peerless CHIEFTAIN; we may crush to the dust the wretches who dare dispute the independence of America.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="034520_0016_0FFE10F674B6F308" MS="y"/>WITH such sentiments, and such a determi∣nation, let the UNITED WORLD appear against us, we are safe, for the SONS of AME∣RICA ARE RESOLVED TO BE FREE.</P>
<P>MAY the Supreme Arbiter of the universe, protect and defend our extensive land. May morals, civilization, and the arts encrease; may our country be free, virtuous and happy.</P>
