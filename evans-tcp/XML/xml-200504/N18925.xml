<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ASSOCIATIONS having been found, by the Experience of all Ages, of great Advantage in the Attainment of the most important Objects—and the Degree of Eminency to which the Manufactures of Eu∣rope have arrived during the present century, being principally owing to the Encourage∣ment which the Artisans in the different Branches have received from Societies form∣ed for that express Purpose, and to the Me∣chanics themselves being associated together under the Sanction of the Laws.—The Me∣chanics and Manufacturers of the Town of Newport, in New-England, viewing such Associations of the first Importance, and sen∣sible of the real Utility, in the Infancy of our Country as an independent Nation, of esta∣blishing its Credit, by the Goodness of its Manufactures (as well those used at Home, as those made for Exportation)—being also anxious to prevent, as far as in their Power, the Drain of Specie consequent on the Im∣portation of the Manufactures of foreign Countries, did on the 10th Day of Novem∣ber, A. D. 1791, agree and associate them∣selves together, "for the Promotion of Home

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE AS the greatest Felicity of human Life results from Society—and as the present divided State of the Mechanics and Manufacturers of the Town of Newport is attended with many disagreeable Circum∣stances, peculiarly disadvantageous to Inge∣nuity and Industry.—And whereas our Bre∣thren, the Mechanics and Manufacturers of the Cities of Philadelphia and New-York, and of the Towns of Boston and Providence, anxious to place their Craft upon a more respectable Footing, have formed themselves into Associations:—The Subscribers, con∣vinced by the Experience of our own Coun∣try, as well as by that of foreign Nations, of the Utility and Advantages arising from such Associations, and wishing to encrease the me∣chanic Interest in this Town, and the United States, as well as to raise a Fund for the Re∣lief of distressed Brethren and their Families—have formed ourselves into a Society, by the Name of the NEWPORT ASSOCIATION of MECHANICS and MANUFACTUR∣ERS;—and, reposing a friendly Confidence
<PB N="10" REF="024618_0014_0FC7DC375C849538"/>
in each other, do hereby agree to be governed by the following Rules, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That the Association shall elect, by a Majority of Votes, to be taken by Ballot, a President, a Vice President, a Treasurer, a Secretary, and a Committee of Correspond∣ence, to continue in Office until the first Monday in April.</P>
<P N="2">2. The President shall have Authority to maintain Order and Decorum, at the Meet∣ings of the Association, and to call a special Meeting at any Time, with the Advice of a Majority of the Committee of Correspond∣ence.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Vice-President, in Case the Presi∣dent shall die, be displaced, or be absent, shall have the same Authority as the President.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Treasurer shall receive and pay away all Monies belonging to the Association, and keep regular Accounts of the same; ob∣serving always to pay no Monies, without an Order signed by the President and Four of the Committee of Correspondence, who are prohibited from drawing more than Three Pounds, between the stated Meetings of the Association, unless specially empowered at a Previous Meeting, and the Treasurer shall
<PB N="11" REF="024618_0015_0FC7DC39C376FE50"/>
give Bonds for the faithful Discharge of his Trust.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Secretary shall keep a Record of the Proceedings of the Association, in a Book to be provided for the Purpose; and shall cause to be published such Parts of the Proceedings or Resolutions as the Association may order, or the President and a Majority of the Commit∣tee of Correspondence may direct.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Committee of Correspondence shall at present consist of Eleven (but may be en∣larged or diminished, at the Discretion of the Association) and it shall be their Duty to attend to, and see executed, the Resolutions of the Association, and such other Matters as they may think proper for the Good of the Institu∣tion, between the stated Meetings, and report their Proceedings at the next Meeting; and a Majority of the said Committee shall be a Quorum to do Business.</P>
<P N="7">7. If any of the Officers aforesaid shall re∣sign, or be displaced, the Association shall fill up the Vacancy in the Mode prescribed in the First Article; and if the President and Vice-President, or Treasurer, or Secretary, be absent at any of the Meetings, the Association may elect one to officiate <HI>pro tempore.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="12" REF="024618_0016_0FC7DC3C98F13D18"/>
8. The Association shall meet on the first Monday in April, in every Year, for the Pur∣pose of choosing their Officers, and transact∣ing the necessary Business; and at such other Times as the Association may direct.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thirteen Members (of which the Presi∣dent, or Vice-President, or Treasurer, or Se∣cretary, must always be one) constitutionally assembled, shall be a Quorum of the Associa∣tion to transact Business; and if that Number should not attend at any Meeting, those assem∣bled shall have Power to adjourn the same.</P>
<P N="10">10. Two-thirds of the Members present at any Meeting, constitutionally empowered to do Business, shall be sufficient to expel a Mem∣ber they may deem unworthy; he having had due Notice of the Complaint, and Time to make his Defence.</P>
<P N="11">11. Any Mechanic or Manufacturer, who has been resident in this Town Three Months previous to his applying to become a Mem∣ber of this Association, and having been pro∣posed by the President, or Vice-President, or any Member of the Committee of Corres∣pondence, may be elected at any Meeting of the Association; and the Election shall be by Ballot.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="13" REF="024618_0017_0FC7DC3DE262DF28"/>
12. Every Person having been duly elect∣ed, and subscribed these Rules, on paying into the Hands of the Treasurer Four Shil∣lings and Sixpence, shall be declared a Mem∣ber; and the Sum of Two Shillings shall be paid annually by each Member; but the Association may, at any annual Meeting, aug∣ment the said Sum, but not to exceed Fifteen Shillings.—And all Donations to the Associ∣ation shall be made through the President, who shall pay them to the Treasurer, and re∣port the same at the next Meeting.—And any Person desirous of being dismissed from this Association, on Application to the Pre∣sident or Vice-President, and paying up his Arrearages, if any, shall by him be dismissed accordingly.</P>
<P N="13">13. If it should so happen, at any Time hereafter, that there should not be Thirteen Members belonging to this Association, then and in that Case all the remaining Funds shall be divided among the Widows and Orphans of those who at the Time of their Decease were Members of the Association, at the Dis∣cretion and under the Direction of the Town∣Council of the Town of Newport for the Time being; and the said Association shall cease.</P>

<P>Whereas it is of the greatest Importance, for the Peace and good Order of this Asso∣ciation, that the Election of Officers should be free, regular, and uninfluenced: It is therefore Voted and Resolved, That in future the following Rules shall be observed:</P>
