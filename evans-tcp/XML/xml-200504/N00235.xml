<P>COnsidering how excedingly pretious the remem∣brance of this heavenly man of God is (whose Poems these are) unto all that knew him, yea, and the thoughts of that sacred ashes locked up within his Tomb, the thoughts of whom is enough to cause Fountains to run over, and to trickle down mine Eyes, and the Eyes of all tender hearts that loved him, this emboldneth me to present unto you this heavenly Song. Endited by him, or rather the holy Spirit of God unto him many years agoe, hoping they will find acceptanec with you, os he had a fluent strain in Poetry, so how ex∣cellent was the matter contained in the same, being full of Direction, Correction, and Consolation, suiting much unto spiritual Edification. What Volums hath he penned for the help of others in their several changes of condition, which if they were all compiled together, would questionless make a large Folio. How was his heart full of good matter? He was another sweet sing∣er of Israel, whoss heavenly Verses passed like to the handkerchief carryed from Paul to help and uphold dis∣consolate ones, and to heal their wracked Souls, by the effectual prisence of Gods holy Spirit. Seeing those are not so visible unto the World, he pleased to peruse these, redivived by this present Impression, wherein we may obs<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve what were Gods former mercyes towards his People in <HI>great Brittain,</HI> his wonderful mercy to <HI>King, Peers,</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> and unto our <HI>Fathers;</HI> when the <HI>Spanish Popish Plot</HI> was dashed in pieces, and the <HI>half Moon</HI> of their Navy, (whose horns stood seven

The discovery also, and defeating the <HI>hellish Powder Plot.</HI> The woful downfall at <HI>Black Friers,</HI> where <HI>Drury</HI> with many of his Attendants breathed their last breath. What sayth <HI>Asaph,</HI> Psal. <HI>78.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Considering (as h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retofore) the Devil with his Instruments have contrived to swallow up that famous Kingdome, and the Church of Christ in it, so now, are not all the Devils of Hell, with such whom they employ, busying themselves to batter down the walls of <HI>Zion,</HI> and to make breaches at the gates thereof, that so they might exe∣cute the utmost Butcheries that can be invented, thereby to over∣throw the Kingdome of Christ here on Earth in every place? but that God who hath been the refuge of his People hitherto, that over∣threw the Egyptians at the red Sea, that destroyed <HI>Sisera</HI> with his Army, he can save his People now in all places. Only let us thankefully remember Gods former mercyes shewed to his people in both Eng∣lands, really and unfeignedly repent of whatsoever we have provo∣ked him with; Call and cry earnestly to him, and trust in the only Rock of Jesus Christ, who is our hope and Salvation for ever.

<HEAD>The Introduction from out of the XXXI. of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> where God chargeth <HI>Moses</HI> to make his Song</HEAD>
<L>BEhold thou shalt with thy fore-Fathers sleep,</L>
<L>As for this People, [whom thou art to leave</L>
<L>"They will not long my Testimonies keep,</L>
<L>"Though now they seem to them so fast to cleave]</L>
<L>"But they will rise up [after thou art gone,</L>
<L>"To scorn my word, and trample it upon]</L>
<L>"After the Gods a whoring will they run,</L>
<L>"Of the strange People which are in the Land,</L>
<L>"Whither they are to take possession,</L>
<L>["And them amongst to fix their wandring band.]</L>
<L>"Me will they cast away, (and are so weak)</L>
<L>"My [holy Cov'nant, made with them to break.</L>
<L>"Then shall my wrath against them kindled be,</L>
<L>"Even in that day [my fury shall be hot,]</L>
<L>"Them I'l forsake, that have forsaken me,</L>
<L>"And hide my face from them that me forgot.</L>
<L>"And they shall of their foes be eaten up,</L>
<L>"Tasting of heavy woe and bitter cup.</L>
<L>"So that themselves shall be inforc't to say,</L>
<L>"In midst of sorrow [came not all these woes,</L>
<L>"On us, because our God is gone away,</L>
<L>"Mong us no longer to have his repose?]</L>
<L>"I will from them in hiding hide my face,</L>
<L>"That evils-all, and other Gods embrace.</L>
<L>"Now therefore write you, for your selves, this Song,</L>
<L>"Which thou mayst teach the Isralytish fry,</L>
<L>"Putting the same into their mouth, [and tongue]</L>
<L>"That it for me 'gainst them may testifie;</L>
<L>"For I will them into the Country lead,</L>
<L>"By Oath unto their Fathers promised,</L>
<L><PB REF="000297_0005_0FA45A5E84829E08"/>"[The Country,] which with milk and hony flows,</L>
<L>"Where, having eat their fill and waxen fat,</L>
<L>"Vnto strange Gods they will their heart dispose,</L>
<L>"And worship them [upon their faces flat,]</L>
<L>"But me they will contemptuously provoke,</L>
<L>"Breaking my Cov'nant, [casting off my yoke.]</L>
<L>"And it shall be, when many evils-sore</L>
<L>"Shall them befall, and make them much complain,</L>
<L>"This Song shall witness, [if there were no more,]</L>
<L>"(In mouth of all their Seed still to remain)</L>
<L>"That I foreknew, what's in their heart or hand</L>
<L>"Before I bring them to the promis'd Land.</L>
<L>Who so would see this song of heav'nly choice,</L>
<L>Penn'd by that holy Shepherd, Isrells guide,</L>
<L>And sweetly uttered with a swan-like voyce,</L>
<L>When here his Soul no longer might abide;</L>
<L>Let him unto that holy Fountain goe,</L>
<L>From whence such streams do plentifully flow.</L>
<L>Nor shall he need to think his time mispent:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE></L>
<L>For what is there to Israel committed,</L>
<L>Hath a more large and general extent,</L>
<L>And to our present times may well be fitted.</L>
<L>Now is that wall of separation own,</L>
<L>Now that is ours, which then was their Renown.</L>
<L>And oh that in their holy Name alone,</L>
<L>And other graces, we did them succeed</L>
<L>Oh that their falshood and rebellion</L>
<L>Had not in us like bitter root and breed!</L>
<L>Oh that by their Example we might see,</L>
<L>Such thoughts, such deeds, such sorrows how to flee.</L>
<L>For us another Canan is provided</L>
<L>Far better: better milk, and better honey.</L>
<L>We look our Spirits should ere long be guided,</L>
<L>To Heav'n it self, where without price or money,</L>
<L>We shall enjoy what here we may but tast,</L>
<L>A joyful-blessed life for aye to last.</L>
<L>Oh then! what manner ones should we be here?</L>
<L>And how refin'd should be both life and heart?</L>
<L>Not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this world, but like our Country d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar,</L>
<L>Where none but holy ones have any part.</L>
<L><PB REF="000297_0006_0FA45A5F42786E58"/>We need not fear these Cananites to follow▪</L>
<L>Who be all perfect, none unsound or hollow.</L>
<L>Yee that in Sion are secure, awake;</L>
<L>Yee that do waver in a Sea of doubt,</L>
<L>How long wil't be, ere the right way ye take,</L>
<L>Halting no more, or compassing about?</L>
<L>Or God, or Baal, Christ, or Masse adore;</L>
<L>Choose which you will: serve one, but halt no more.</L>
<L>Remember who it is that witness bare,</L>
<L>"Even that <HI>Amen</HI> the witness true and sure,</L>
<L>"Who made all Creatures to be what they are,</L>
<L>"I know thy works [they cannot proof endure]</L>
<L>"Thou art not cold, nor art thou hot enough,</L>
<L>"I would thou wert key cold, or hot in love.</L>
<L>"Sith then that Luke-warm is the frame and mold</L>
<L>["Which all this while after all my cost,]</L>
<L>"Thou hast attained; neicher not nor cold</L>
<L>["So that my labour seems to be but lost,]</L>
<L>"I am resolv'd, [Consider what I say]</L>
<L>"Out of my mouth to spew thee quite away.</L>
<L>Oh heavy doom, how can we chuse but tremble!</L>
<L>"We say we're rich, and full, and nothing need:</L>
<L>"But God knows all; [he knows how we dissemble]</L>
<L>"Poor, wretched-Caytises, without sight or weede;</L>
<L>"Buy then of him, gold, Robes, and Ointment bright,</L>
<L>"Rich, cloth'd, to make us; and of clearer sight.</L>
<L>Then shall we see the end of all his Threts,</L>
<L>[That he an holy awe might keep us in;]</L>
<L>And why his naked glittering Sword he whets,</L>
<L>[That we might well repent us of our sin;]</L>
<L>And why he doth such strange deliv'rance send,</L>
<L>[That we might praise him, and our lives amend.]</L>
<L>This very end it was that moved me,</L>
<L>(Though not so fit, to undertake the Taske,)</L>
<L>To frame this Song, or Story (as you see)</L>
<L>(Be sure the liquor's good, what ere the caske.)</L>
<L>For here, as in a glass you may behold,</L>
<L>The works that God hath wrought, some new, some old.</L>
<L><PB REF="000297_0007_0FA45A604787B048"/>Yet none so old, but young men may remember</L>
<L>The farthest works that here I shall recite,</L>
<L>Have they been hid as under heaps of ember?</L>
<L>Now will I take them up into the light.</L>
<L>Indeed they are not hid, but men are blind,</L>
<L>And loth to call the works of God to mind.</L>
<L>For diverse worthy ones with faithful pen,</L>
<L>Have writ the most that I am writing here,</L>
<L>Calling to th' praise of God, unthankful men</L>
<L>(Which might their Souls unto his grace endeer)</L>
<L>But oh! how few do prize such godly pains,</L>
<L>Or reap unto themselves such profer'd gains?</L>
<L>Yet will I venture; all are not alike;</L>
<L>God will have prayses (for they be his due,)</L>
<L>A silly rod the stony Rock may strike,</L>
<L>A silly Song forgotten works renew.</L>
<L>If men be mute, then babes; if babes, an Asse</L>
<L>Or else the stones, shall bring Gods will to pass.</L>
<L>And if you'l have me tell you all my heart,</L>
<L>'Tis not my hope (yet would I not presage)</L>
<L>That <HI>men</HI> will take my plainness in good part.</L>
<L>But come, ye children, ye of tender Age,</L>
<L>This unto you I write, and thus in Verse,</L>
<L>That ye might best conceive, learn, and reherse.</L>
<L>Come Children, hearken and consider well,</L>
<L>Gods Word will teach you best, but works withal</L>
<L>(Such works as I shall very plainly tell)</L>
<L>Will teach you how with fear on God to call.</L>
<L>Thou Lord, which dost the little ones affect,</L>
<L>Let this poor Song thy little ones recall.</L>

<HEAD>A Song of Thanksgiving for the lasting Remem∣brance of Gods wonder∣ful worsk, never to be forgotten.</HEAD>
<L>FIrst. I'le begin with Eighty eight,</L>
<L>That most admyred year,</L>
<L>When't was in king of Spains conceipt</L>
<L>Ore's all to domineer.</L>
<L>The Seas were spred with stately saile,</L>
<L>their Men and their Munition</L>
<L>Were all prepared without faile</L>
<L>to bring us to perdition.</L>
<L>How many scores of Shipping-tall,</L>
<L>and of their Gallyes long!</L>
<L>How many Regiments withal</L>
<L>of Souldiers stout and strong!</L>
<L>How many hundred Horse to praunce,</L>
<L>and Mules for carriage meet!</L>
<L>How many thousand Ordinance</L>
<L>were carryed in the Fleet!</L>
<L>How many hundred thousand pound</L>
<L>of Powder and of Bullet!</L>
<L>How many millions were found</L>
<L>of victuals for the Gullet!</L>
<L>Who so would make a just account</L>
<L>must reckon for the least,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="000297_0009_0FA45A6442506458"/>For to such number all amount</L>
<L>as cannot be exprest.</L>
<L>Besides, great store and company</L>
<L>of tearing torturing Whips,</L>
<L>And instruments of cruelty,</L>
<L>provided in their Ships;</L>
<L>As meaning not to be so kind,</L>
<L>our blood at once to spill,</L>
<L>But by our lingring pain, their mind</L>
<L>and bloody lusts to fill.</L>
<L>From seven years old, (or if not so,</L>

<L>All had been kill'd, both high and low,</L>
<L>their Sword could light upon.</L>
<L>Virgins had dyde, when they had first</L>

<L>Women unript, on Spears accurst,</L>
<L>had seen their Infants tost.</L>
<L>The children, whom they meant to save,</L>
<L>with brand of Iron hot,</L>
<L>Were in their face (like Indian slave,)</L>
<L>to bear a seared spot.</L>
<L>Their Soul (alas) had been a spoyle</L>
<L>to Soul-destroying Pope;</L>
<L>Their bodyes spent in restless toyle,</L>
<L>without all ease or hope.</L>
<L>There were but few that should obtain</L>
<L>this mercy, which was such</L>
<L>As if you reckon up the gaine,</L>
<L>You'l say it was not much.</L>
<L>Yea, they that serv'd the Romish gods</L>
