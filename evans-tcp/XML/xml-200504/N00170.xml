<P>Quest. <HI>But how may we so seek God as to find him, and a supply of righteousnes from him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Seek him heartily and sincerely, <HI>Isai. 26 9. With my soul have</HI> I <HI>desired thee in the night season, with my spirit with∣in me will</HI> I <HI>seek thee,</HI> Jer. 29.3. <HI>And ye shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me withal your heart.</HI> God will not be mocked in any case, much less in this which is of such high im∣portance. It was <HI>Israels</HI> folly of old, <HI>Psal. 78.36.37.</HI> when he slew them then they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought him, they enquired early after God, nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth: they lyed unto him with their tongues: take we heed least we fail here. It is time to make righteousness our design, to Preach for this, Pray for this, Hear for this sincerely, heartily; least while in shew we seek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, but with our hearts go after other things, we lose this and other things too, <HI>Mat. 6.33. Blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness</HI>: for such will be beyond complement, and seek in truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seek seasonably, early, speedily, <HI>2 Cor: 6:2: Behold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of salvation; to day if you will hear his voice hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n not your hearts.</HI> Lose not you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day, while God calleth, while his spirit moveth, while life lasteth, while you have liberty, means, helps and advantages about you, before the decree come forth, seek righteousness least the Clouds return after rain; least your Sabbaths be again turned into dayes of labour, and weariness, hazard and hardship: lest instead of the voice of the Turtle, you have the noise of War, least you come too late to be accepted, <HI>Numb: 14</HI>:6, 7: The Spirit of God strove earnestly by <HI>Ioshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> to perswade <HI>Israel</HI> to go for∣ward, but in vain, for in their frowardness and fit, they let up their spirits, and would not hearken.</P>
<P>Wherefore in the 28: and 29: verses, God giveth forth his de∣cree, <HI>As truly as</HI> I <HI>live,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will</HI> I <HI>do to you, your carkases shall fall in the wilderness</HI>: after this they changed their mind, <HI>ver</HI>: 39, 40: <HI>The People mourned greatly, and they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain,</HI> saying, <HI>Lo we be here,, and we will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI>; but their motion
<PB N="22" REF="000230_0025_0FA36D2B88A516C8"/>
take not. Though they rose early, though they mourned, and went up to the mountain.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But hath not God said that those that seek him early shall find him,</HI> Prov. 8.17.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> True: but mans early is many times Gods late, <HI>Prov. 1.28 Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and and no man regarded, but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof</HI>: I <HI>also will laugh at your calamity, they shall seek me early but they shall not find me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Seek him earnestly: Seek first the kingdome of God and his righteousness, with that intention and height of desires, which becometh the worth, excellency and necessity of the thing sought. Righteousness is the principal thing life is in it: win it and you win all, miss it and all is lost; O therefore seek importunately, not only with your hearts sincerely, but with al your hearts strong∣ly. Warm your spirits with the consideration forementioned, reallize them, mix them with faith, meditate much on them, that you may be suitably raised in your desires and endeavours after righteousness.</P>
<P N="4">4. Seek him humbly, with a heart broken down and abased in the sence of sin and misery, weakness and unworthiness. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, <HI>a broken and a cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e heart he will not despise,</HI> Psal. 51.17. <HI>He forgetteth not the cry of the humble,</HI> Psal. 9▪12. but until our fallow ground be broken up, it will not be Gods time, to come and rain righteousness upon us. It behoveth us therefore, to remember the Wormwood and the Gall, and to have our souls humbled within us: to sit alone and put our mouths in the dust, if there may be hope for us, accept∣ing the punishment of our iniquity: for our des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uction is of our selves, our own sword hath devoured our children: we have procured these things unto our selves: but our help is not in our own hand. Be it that eternal salvation, the welfare of our whole man, the preservation of the land, our lives, our little ones, our peace, our liberty, all good depend upon our unfained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urning to God in Christ, and being righteous; yet this is wholly beyond our power, we have no might for it, <HI>Turn thou me,</HI> Jer. 31.18. herein appeareth the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etchedness of a natural man. Should God pass by all former provocations, and say to him, do but this one thing and all shall be well, love the fountain of good∣ness,
<PB N="23" REF="000230_0026_0FA36D2C48270170"/>
who is also thy life: although nothing can be more rational then this, yet he is unto nothing more impotent and averse, <HI>Rom. 8.7. The carnal mind is enmity unto God, is not subject nor can it be.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover we cannot deserve that God should turn us, we are ungodly and enemies as well as without strength, <HI>Rom. 5.6, 10.</HI> If therefore after many other judgements which have come upon us for our sins, God should now give us up to a blind mind, and a hard hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, fill us with our own devices, leave us to a reprobate sence, make the heavens over us to be brass, command the clouds that they rain not on us, withhold his free spirit, send a dry wind not to fan, nor to purge, but to blast all means, making his word and ordinances, changes of mercy and affliction to be a savour of death unto death. He would be righteous, tis true, without righteousness we perish. It is as true that nothing but infinite grace, working without, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against deserts of ours can make us righteous. When therefore we pray for righteousness, we may well take <HI>Davids</HI> words, <HI>Psal. 9 1. Have mercy upon us O God of our righteousness, and hear our prayer.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Seek him believingly, with a holy dependance upon the mercy, power, truth and faithfulness of God in Jesus Christ. Re∣member <HI>James</HI> His BUT, <HI>Jam. 1.6. But let him ask in Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) Our sins are indeed many, and our iniquities very great but there is merit enough in the blood of Jesus to redeem them from all, <HI>1 Joh. 1.7.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Though all means are of themselves, weak, and utter∣ly insufficient to subdue our corrupt and rebellious wills, yet with the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength; if he will he can convince, enlighten, humble, perswade, sanctifie, quicken and enlarge uncontroleably, when he will work none can let. It is nothing with him to save, <HI>2 Chron. 14.11.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3) You have the countenance of Gods command to encou∣rage in going to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m for righteousness: so the Text before us: thus <HI>Zeph. 2.2. Seek righteousness, Mat. 6.33.</HI> now let us improve this word, not only to awe conscience, but to strengthen and an∣nimate faith, <HI>Mark 10.49. Be of good comfort, arise, he calleth thee.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) You have the shadow of the promise to sit in and wait <HI>Luk 11 13.</HI> how much more wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l he give his Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it to them that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k him.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="24" REF="000230_0027_0FA36D2D57FB86C0"/>(5.) Consider the example of poor needy sinners that have gone before you: what happy welcome found <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer 31 19 surely I have heard <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoaning himself thus, <HI>Thou hast chast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed me and I was chast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed, turn thou me and I shall be turned,</HI> Is <HI>Ephraim</HI> my dear childe? It is unto God a most accep∣table request, to ask of him the rain of righteousness: He had rather we should seek him for the meat which endureth to eter∣nal life than for that which perisheth.</P>
<P><HI>Let it be to him for a name and a praise for ever.</HI> Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdome and love of God, who knowing our frame, and how eager we are, in our pursuit of inferiour things, maketh a bait of them, wherewith to draw us to him for such as are infinitely better, <HI>even his Kingdome and Righteousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Mat. 6.33.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Seek him unanimously: The stress lieth here, therefore life together. We in <HI>New-England</HI> are a poor and an affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted people: It is not for us to rejoice with other Nations in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> num∣ber o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our strength; but that mattereth not, if God be with us we shall do well enough, notwithstanding our poverty, our little∣ness, and mean outward esta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

If the mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of Rocks be our defence we are safe: Can we desire greater serenity peace, and safety, then we have injoyed in years past. <HI>Jehovahs</HI> arm is not shortened, there is no shadow of turning with him. If we be righteous he will love us, and we shall dwell safely by his side. If any thing undoe us it will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighteousness our want of the fear of God, our want of love to Jesus Christ, our forsaking the fountain of living waters, our undutiful and provoking carriage to the Angel that leadeth us by the way: but if righteousness be rained on us all will be well. It is enough, O therefore let every one put in for that with all the strength he can make.</P>
