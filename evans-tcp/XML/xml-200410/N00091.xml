<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>HOw</HI> happy would be the condition of Gods people in this world? <HI>How</HI> sweet and amiable would their conversing to∣gether be? <HI>How</HI> honourable to God and Christ, and to the Gospel of Truth and Peace in the sight of all? if their love to every Di∣vine truth, and mutually among themselves, in the truth, and for the truths sake, did so shine forth, that it might be said of them, as it was observed and said in former times by Heathen Persecutors; <HI>See how these Christians love one another?</HI> This is the real cha∣racter of Christs Disciples, and a proper effect of that purity of heart, which proceeds from effectual faith in Jesus Christ; therefore the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> saith in, 1 Pet. 1.22. <HI>Seeing ye have purifyed your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren: See that ye love one another with a pure

heart fervently.</HI> But here is one <HI>maim and misery,</HI> that, as our knowledge of the truth is <HI>imperfect,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our love to it, and one to another is <HI>imperfect</HI>; though the way of love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>a more excellent way,</HI> as the Apostle argueth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. From the defect <HI>hereof,</HI> or <HI>herein,</HI> it is, that differences in apprehensi∣ons cause such distances and animosities among those who agree in fundamentals, through the remainders of flesh, even in the regenerate; though we are taught <HI>whereto we have already attained, to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k by the same rule, and to mind the same thing,</HI> expecting, that <HI>if in anything we be otherwise minded, God will reveal this unto us,</HI> Phil. 3.15, 16. As for <HI>needless contradicti∣ons,</HI> and <HI>causless oppositions,</HI> what do they else but weaken the <HI>hearts and hands</HI> of Saints in the work of the Lord, and strengthen adversaries in their mali∣cious and subtil designs and enterprises against the truth? Both which might be prevented, if Gods people would <HI>stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving for the faith of the Gospel.</HI> Wisdom expecteth to be justifyed of her Children, and therefore teach∣eth them to <HI>cry after knowledge, and to lift up their voice for understanding, to seek her as silver, and to search for her as for hid treasures.</HI> Which is to be done by searching the Scriptures diligently, with servent prayer, for the illumination of the spirit of truth, that we may find those <HI>spiritual treasures</HI> which yet he hid in these <HI>rich Mines.</HI> Though <HI>all the words of wis∣dom's mouth are plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge</HI>; yet mens too much in∣dulging their own conceits even in <HI>Doctrins of faith,</HI> and of Gods worship in <HI>Church-order,</HI> hath caused many Disputes and Controversies among Learned men, by their <HI>mis-understanding</HI> or <HI>mis-applying</HI> sun∣dry
<PB REF="000143_0003_0FA263369C99CED0"/>
Texts of Scripture to the <HI>corrupting of their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ.</HI> Therefore if self-confidence and <HI>leaning to our own understanding,</HI> must be carefully avoided in such weighty matters, which are more clearly and plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y expressed; much more in darker portions of Scripture, such as Prophesies of future times and things are: and among them, those that concern the effectual Voca∣tion and <HI>Salvation of Israel</HI> (which is the Subject of the <HI>ensuing Treatise</HI>) concerning which the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> commanded <HI>Daniel</HI> to <HI>shut up the words, and seal the Book, even to the time of the end, Dan.</HI> 12.4. Which shews, that this Prophesie, though it be ob∣scure before, yet when the time for the accomplish∣ing of it approacheth, many shall be stirred up to in∣quire with all diligence into the meaning of it, which is meant by their <HI>running to and fro,</HI> and the promise for their encouragement so to do, is, that <HI>knowledge shall be increased,</HI> that is, by the assistance and blessing of <HI>the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah, <HI>the root of</HI> David, <HI>who alone is worthy to open the sealed Book,</HI> Rev. 5.5, 9.</P>
<P>The Reverend <HI>Author</HI> hath worthily ingaged in this <HI>running to and fro,</HI> and hath given an account of what discoveries he hath made of <HI>the present truth,</HI> by the travel of his soul in searching the Scriptures, to find out what was formerly hid from many. When I heard that his spirit was excited to handle this Subject, in his publick Sermons, I was glad, believing that the holy spirit inclined him thereun∣to, and would assist him therein. As I believed, so I found, when I read his <HI>Manuscript</HI>; which though straits of time, and multiplicity of diversions, did not permit me to peruse so exactly, as to examine
<PB REF="000143_0004_0FA2633C44584630"/>
every passage accurately and critically, yet the sub∣stance and principal Contents of it (<HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>First, that the elect <HI>Israelites</HI> of the ten, as well as of the two Tribes called <HI>Iudah,</HI> shall be converted. Second∣ly, That this will not be before <HI>Romes</HI> ruine. Thirdly, That the great and settled glory of the Church on earth will not be before the coming of Christ to judgment) seemed to me to be clearly drawn from the Scripture of truth, and to be by him held forth, <HI>seasonably, piously, elaborately, judiciously, and modestly.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Seasonably</HI>; These Sermons being preached in a time when constant reports from sundry places and hands gave out to the world, that the <HI>Israelites</HI> were upon their journey towards <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> from sundry Forreign parts in great multitudes, and that they were carryed on with great signs and wonders by a high and mighty hand of extraordinary provi∣dence, to the admiration and astonishment of all that heard it, and that they had written to others of their Nation, in <HI>Europe and America,</HI> to encourage and invite them to hasten to them. This seemed to many godly and judicious to be a beginning of the accomplishment <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg">The Authors opinion (as is to be seen in the following Tractate) was and is, that the late and present rumours about the <HI>Iews,</HI> will prove an emi∣nent, if not an ultimate im∣pletion of that Prophesie, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24 24.</NOTE> of that Prophesie concern∣ing <HI>the noise and shaking, and coming together of those dry bones</HI> spoken of in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.7. which was to be a <HI>preparitory</HI> to that which followeth in <HI>verse</HI> 8, 9, 10, 11. This being to be accomplished in its season, the Lord was plea∣sed to fix the mind and meditations of the godly
<PB REF="000143_0004_0FA2633C44584630"/>
<HI>Author</HI> upon that great truth, <HI>the Salvation of all Is∣rael,</HI> as <HI>a word upon its wheels,</HI> uttered with due respect to circumstances, which <HI>Solomon</HI> likens to <HI>Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver,</HI> Prov. 25.11.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Piously</HI>; His aim and intention being to pro∣mote the glory of God, and the Edification of his people in godliness; whereunto the subject of his <HI>Discourse</HI> hath a direct tendency, as the Apostle <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> proves, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.10. to 15. and accordingly the Reader will find it to be improved in the <HI>follow∣ing Treatise.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Elaborately</HI>; As appears in the more than or∣dinary pains taken by him in searching the Scri∣ptures, and variety of Learned Writers, both Anci∣ent and Modern.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Iudiciously</HI>; This is evident in his solid expo∣sition of sundry Texts alledged by him, and in his Arguments for Confirmation of the truth, and in his satisfying Answers unto Objections propo∣sed.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>destly</HI>; For he neither doth peremptorily determine matters disputable, nor doth he arrogate unto hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self any light above others in this Mystery; but expresseth his desire and hope that some others will be excited to take pains about this Subject, <HI>&amp; in eodem circo currere ad Palmam.</HI></P>
<P>It remains for my finishing this <HI>Epistle,</HI> that I humbly caution the wise hearted <HI>Reader,</HI> against two great Impediments of his impartial and right judg∣ing, of what is presented to his view in the <HI>ensuing Discourse, viz.</HI> Pride of understanding and Evil pre∣judice.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Pride of understanding,</HI> which renders men <HI>self pleasing</HI> with pertinacy, Cuckow-like, <HI>qui s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am can∣tilenam
<PB REF="000143_0005_0FA2633E4C6994F0"/>
approbat,</HI> with contempt to others, whose <HI>ap∣prehensions</HI> differ from their <HI>conceptions</HI>: This is a Leaven that <HI>swels and sowers</HI> mens Spirits; This makes men self-willed, which is forbidden in a Bi∣shop, <HI>Titus</HI> 1.7. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: And it is noted as a brand of the false Prophets, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.10. Such read good Books with a mind rather to contradict, than to receive the truths published by others, be∣cause <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Homine imperito nunquam quidquam injustius, qui nisi quod ipse facit nihil rectum putat.</HI></NOTE> themselves were not the publishers of them. A publick spi∣rit is a good Antidote against this poison, which will cause a man to rejoyce in the proceeding and prospering of any work, for the publick good in the hands of others, though themselves had no hand in it; as <HI>Luther</HI> said to <HI>Melancthon; si nos non erimus digni, fiat per alios.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Evil prejudice</HI>; There is a <HI>good prejudice,</HI> when a man from good principles hath a right judgment setled in his mind, whereby he is prepared to dis∣cern good from evil, and truth from errour, in what he readeth. In way of contra-distinction to this, I call its opposite <HI>evil prejudice,</HI> which ariseth from evil causes; I shall instance in two.</P>
<P N="1">"1. Tradition, not warranted by Scripture. There was a common <HI>opinion</HI> among the <HI>Iews</HI> recei∣ved by such a <HI>Tradition,</HI> that the <HI>Messias</HI> at his first coming, would set up a glorious worldly Kingdom amongst them, like that of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> and that he would free them from their sujection to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and make them Rulers of the earth. This errour wrought ill effects, not only in the unbelie∣ving
<PB REF="000143_0005_0FA2633E4C6994F0"/>
<HI>Iews,</HI> whom it hindred from receiving Christ, when he was come in the flesh by their being offend∣ed at him, for his outward, mean, and afflicted con∣dition, and death on the Cross; but also in his own Disciples, whom it hindred from understanding and believing whatsoever Christ spake of his suffer∣ings and death. Yea, this errour was so deeply root∣ed in them, that after Christs Resurrection they asked him, <HI>Lord, wilt thou at this time again restore the Kingdom to Israel, Acts</HI> 1.6. Christs answer in <HI>ver.</HI> 7. shews, that they erred about the time, intima∣ting that this was not the season, but another time was appointed for that, <HI>viz. at Christs second coming for the salvation of all Israel.</HI> Yet concerning this his <HI>second coming,</HI> to set up his Kingdom on earth, some acknowledge no kingdom of Christ on earth, but spiritual and invisible in the hearts of the elect. The kingdom of Christ hath indeed been set up by his effectual operation of the spirit in the Ministry of the Gospel, from the first publishing of the Go∣spel, according to <HI>Psal.</HI> 24.7, 9. &amp; 110.2, 3. But there is another, a <HI>Political Kingdom of Christ</HI> to be set up <HI>in the last times,</HI> foretold by <HI>Dan.</HI> in Chap. 2.44, 45. &amp; 7.14, 18, 22. to 28. and by the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> unto the Virgin <HI>Mary, Luke</HI> 1.32, 33. and by the Apostle <HI>Iohn,</HI> in <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. and 20. chap. <HI>Yea, and all the Prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days</HI>: As <HI>Peter</HI> saith, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.24. But about this also they, who of late were called <HI>fifth Monar∣chy-men,</HI> did err on the other hand, especially two ways. First, By anticipating the time, which will not be till the pouring out of the sixth and seventh Vials. Secondly, By putting themselves upon a
<PB REF="000143_0006_0FA2633EEB1EF4A8"/>
work which shall not be done by men, but by Christ himself, <HI>sitting upon his white horse, who will in righ∣teousness judge, and make war, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and a Name written that no man knew but himself, and will be cloathed with a Vesture dipt in bloud</HI> (accor∣ding to that Prophesie in <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.2.) <HI>and his Name is called the word of God. And the armies which were in heaven follow him upon white horses, cloathed in fine Lin∣nen white and clean,</HI> Rev. 19.11. to 15. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. The second evil cause, from whence this e∣vil prejudice ariseth, is from the abuse of these spiritual truths by carnally-minded persons.</Q>
Such were those <HI>carnal Chiliasts</HI> or <HI>Millenaries,</HI> who dreamed of a worldly happiness consisting in carnal and sensual contentments to be injoyed in the 1000 years, Prophesied of in <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. The loathsome∣ness of their absurd errour, wrought such a loathing of their opinion in sundry godly Learned Writers, that they declined the literal exposition of <HI>the first Resurrection, Rev.</HI> 20 12. Which will be <HI>of the just</HI> (as it is called in <HI>Luke</HI> 14.14.) in the beginning of the <HI>thousand years,</HI> when Christ will judge Anti∣christ and other living enemies of his Church, and after the end thereof will be the general Resurrecti∣on to the general judgment, as is noted and proved by that Learned man Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> (who was no <HI>phana∣tick,</HI> as the <HI>Prelates</HI> themselves will grant) out of <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. and other places of Scripture. This king∣dom of Christ must be placed (as he saith) between Christs appearing in his kingdom, and the last Re∣surrection of all the world unto the general judg∣ment. (I suppose he meaneth according to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24, 25. and so includes the finishing of the gene∣ral judgment in the end of the world within the
<PB REF="000143_0006_0FA2633EEB1EF4A8"/>
time of Christs kingdom.) And that this is that kingdom of Christ whereof <HI>Daniel</HI> prophesied in <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.13, 14. &amp; 18, 22, 26, 27. and the Apostle <HI>Iohn, Rev.</HI> 20. he proveth by two Arguments, and concludes, that they go about to take away the Pil∣lar of Evangelical faith, concerning the glorious coming of Christ, who neglecting the Ancient Tra∣dition of the Church, endeavour to transfer the prophesie in <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. elsewhither. Yet some expound <HI>the first Resurrection</HI> in a spiritual sense (declining the Literal) and understand it of the elects effectual re∣ceiving the truth; but this hath been done in all Ages, since the first publishing of the Gospel gra∣dually, as <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.18. and therefore is not the mea∣ning of that prophesie. And Dr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin</HI> proveth the <HI>bodily Resurrection</HI> of the Martyrs from <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.5, 6, 7. by clear and good Textual Argu∣ments, in his Sermons on <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.21, 22. p. 32. and on <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9, 10. p. 18. to the end. They also note that the thousand years wherein Satan was bound, begins in the year 300. after Christ, when the Per∣secutions of Christians by the Heathen Emperours ceased: But this agreeth not with the binding of Satan in the bottomless pit during that thousand years; for it is manifest, that since that time Satan hath by his instruments seduced and persecuted the Saints as much, at least, as at any time before: How then can it be said, that he was then bound for 1000 years? <HI>Alstediu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a very Learned and indefatigably industrious Writer, wrote a Book, wherein he pro∣veth, that the 1000 years foretold in <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. are yet to come; and to avoid all appearance of sym∣bolizing with the <HI>carnal Chiliasts,</HI> he Intituleth his book, <HI>Diatribe de mille annis Apocalypticis, non illis
<PB REF="000143_0007_0FA2633F9E95BA28"/>
Chiliasturum &amp; phantastarum, sed B. B. Danielis &amp; Iohannis.</HI> And he placeth the happiness of that time 1. In the Resurrection of the Martyrs and their reigning on earth. 2. The increase of the Church, and the Conversion of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the ful∣ness of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> 3. The freedom of the Church from the persecutions of enemies. 4. Their long lasting peace. 5. The Reformation of Doctrins. 6. The Majesty and glory of the Church. 7. Their sincere joy; whereunto may be added,
<Q>such a perfection of light, and holiness, and love, as is attainable on this side of heaven.</Q>
To conclude, when true principles are held forth in the Letter of any Text, and some draw false inferences from thence, let the mis-collections of vain men be re∣futed, and the truth be declared, and the declarati∣on thereof <HI>be accepted of all the Saints:</HI> How often doth the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> complain of mens abusing his holy Doctrins? Did he therefore avoid the holding forth of such truths? No, he confirmed those truths, and refuted the contrary errours with detestation. See <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.3. to 9. &amp; 5.20, 21. with 6.1, 2, &amp; 9.19, 20. And even that Doctrine which borders up∣on the Subject of <HI>the following Treatise</HI> delivered by him for the comfort of the Saints in, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.14. to 18. was abused by some whom he refuted in 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.1. to 13. And <HI>the Apostle Peter professeth his consent</HI> with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> and he addeth a de∣scription of the <HI>new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness,</HI> and this saith he, <HI>we look for ac∣cording to his promise</HI> (that promise is in <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.17. &amp; 66.22.) which shall be here before the general judgment, and the end of the world, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7. to 16. This time <HI>Paul</HI> calls, <HI>the time of the manifestation
<PB REF="000143_0007_0FA2633F9E95BA28"/>
of the Sons of God, for which</HI> he saith, <HI>the earnest ex∣pectation of the creature waiteth, in hope that then it shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glo∣rious liberty of the Children of God, Rom.</HI> 8.19. to 23. This state of things on earth, is called <HI>the world to come</HI> in <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.5. Dr. <HI>Tho. Goodwin</HI> in his Sermons upon <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.21, 22, hath <HI>acutely and judici∣ously</HI> proved, that the <HI>world to come</HI> meant in <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.5. is a state between the state of the world as now it is, and the state of things after the day of judg∣ment, when <HI>God shall be all in all.</HI> It is of purpose, and in a more special manner appointed for Jesus Christ to be King in. This he proveth clearly and at large, both from the Context in <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. and from <HI>Psal.</HI> 8. and from other Texts of Scriptures, of which I have not now time to speak, but refer the Reader to those Sermons of the Drs. mentioned, which are Entituled, <HI>The World to come, or the kingdom of Christ asserted.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> vindicated the Apo∣stle <HI>Paul</HI> in this point against the <HI>unlearned and un∣stable,</HI> which <HI>wrested his words, as also they did other Scriptures</HI> (to extort a sense from them which they never intended) <HI>to their own destruction.</HI> Now the good Lord give us understanding in all things! and bless the Labours of this faithful Servant of Jesus Christ, for the good of many.

with the others, not <HI>Israel</HI> the Elect, for that is no Mystery, but <HI>Israel</HI> the Iewish Nation, which was cut off, shall be call'd and saved, and that's a <HI>Mystery,</HI> Rom. <HI>11.25.</HI> Some do grant the whole body of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> shall be call'd, but not come into their own Land, for the Lord Christ hath prophesied, that their house shall be left <HI>desolate,</HI> but not for ever; it was prophesied of their for∣mer house, that it should be <HI>desolate,</HI> Isa. <HI>6.11.</HI> yet af∣ter it was <HI>restored</HI> and <HI>inhabited,</HI> and Christ intimates as much of <HI>this,</HI> Luke <HI>13.35.</HI> it should lie desolate till he came again: Then it shall be restored and inhabited by the <HI>Jewish Nation.</HI> At that time the thousand years men∣tioned, <HI>Rev. 20.4.</HI> will begin, and a glorious state of the Church be in the world, exceeding any condition it hath ever yet been in. This glorious estate some will not own, because they would not have people look for a greater glory than their present Church hath: Some call it Here∣sie, so the Doctrine of Christ was call'd in <HI>Pauls</HI> time, some say it is Novelty, and thereupon dislike it, but its anci∣enter than <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stin Martyr,</HI> its an Apostolical truth, <HI>Rev. 20.4.</HI> Those who had suffered for the witness of Iesus <HI>li∣ved</HI> and reigned with Christ a <HI>1000</HI> years:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trap in loc.</HI></NOTE> but its not said, they lived again.

They lived and reigned. It may be worthy inquiry, whether these souls be not the <HI>New Jeru∣salem</HI> coming down from God out of heaven, and so be the Tabernacle of God with men, and fulfil that <HI>Rev. 5.10.</HI> We shall reign on the Earth, what need a new heaven, and a new earth, if the reigning with Christ he spiritual and

Of these three things, <HI>viz.</HI> the call of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their possession of their own Land, and their glo∣rious estate, the Author of this Work hath spoken both Learnedly and judiciously: and though he touch upon the time when these things shall be, yet he doth it with great wisdom, moderation, and caution. He doth not fix the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of time, which many having done, have exposed themselves to censure. He conceives the time to be near, and gives good grounds for such a conception, and two signs thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the sleepiness of wise and foolish Virgins, which imports the Bridegroom is near and coming, and the present shakings of Nations, which are fore-runners of deliverance. God shakes foundations and pillars of States when he is about doing great things for his people, <HI>Joel 3.16. Jer. 50.46.</HI> Unto these may be added, First, The strong workings of mens spirits at this day; for not only Protestants, but Papists, Iews, Turks, Mahome∣tans, and other Idolaters do expect some great Revolution of Affairs, as Travellers that have been amongst them do relate. Secondly, The wickedness of Potentates indulging their lusts, abusing their power, ruling by their own will, persecuting those are good, and interposing unduly in the things of God, and oppressing the poor. Thirdly, The great distractions and confusions which are at this time in the Governments, Counsels, and Transactions of worldly Rulers, States, and Kingdoms, their Foundations are out of course, and they know not what to do. These and many others do raise the Faith and expectation of observing men, that the Lord will shortly appear, and do some wonderful things for his people. Reader, this Work needs not letters Com∣mendatory, it speaks for it self, being Learned, Elaborate,

well-composed, containing many Mysterious truths and matters of great weight, with Rules to understand the same.

<P N="1"><PB REF="000143_0011_0FA263429CB8F760"/>1.

<P N="2">2. Under the sixth Trumpet, <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 10.5, 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>The An∣gel</HI> (which is Jesus Christ) <HI>who sets his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth, lifteth up his hand to heaven, and sweareth by him that liveth for ever and e∣ver, that there should be time no longer; but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath de∣clared to his servants the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Now the question is, what this mystery may be which must be finished after the sounding of the se∣venth Trumpet, which is the concluding Trumpet,
<PB REF="000143_0012_0FA263436AB39078"/>
after which none shall sound, till the <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.16.</NOTE> Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-angel, and with the Trumpet of God, which is called <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.52.</NOTE> <HI>last trum∣pet.</HI> This mystery then is such a one as is to be finished in the close, or last part of the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a mystery to be finished at the Re∣surrection of the dead saith the Apostle, <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.51.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, I shew you a myste∣ry, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</HI> But this is not the mystery here meant, for we do not find this declared to God's servants the Prophets.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a myste∣ry of iniquity, <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.7. <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.5.</NOTE> such is Antichristianism, which must be finished and <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 11.15.—to the end.</NOTE> utterly destroyed under the seventh Trumpet. But neither is this the myste∣ry here spoken of, which is called <HI>The mystery of God,</HI> whereas Antichristianism is <HI>the mystery of ini∣quity,</HI> and so the Devil's mystery.</P>
<P N="3">3. This mystery then must be that of the calling and in-coming of the <HI>Iews,</HI> with the fulness of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> for I find no other mystery. And this is called <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 11.25.</NOTE> <HI>a mystery</HI> by the Apostle, and such a one also as hath been a∣bundantly declared to God's servants the Prophets, as you will see in the ensuing Treatise. And this interpretation of <HI>the mystery of God to be finished under
<PB REF="000143_0012_0FA263436AB39078"/>
the seventh Trumpet,</HI> answereth the scope of the An∣gel who spake of it to <HI>Iohn.</HI> For the appearing of the Angel in that form, and the little book in his hand, and his taking that solemn Oath, are all conso∣latory to the Church greatly suffering under Anti∣christ during the sounding of the sixth Trumpet; and what can be more comfortable, than to hear that these sufferings of the Church are not long to continue, but the calling of the <HI>Iews,</HI> and coming in of the fulness of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the spreading of the everlasting Gospel, and enlarging the kingdom of Christ (so much narrowed by the power of Turk and Pope under the sixth Trumpet) and the final confusion both of Turk, and <HI>man of sin,</HI> are drawing on, and to be accomplished under the seventh Trum∣pet? So that this place in the Revelations of <HI>Iohn,</HI> seemeth clearly to lead us to the calling of the <HI>Iews.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 16.12.</NOTE> We find the sixth Angel pouring out his vial upon the great River <HI>Euphrates</HI> whereby the water, thereof is dryed up, that the way of the Kings of the East may be prepared. Now I humbly conceive, that the <HI>Iews</HI> lie fairest for the claim o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Title of <HI>the Kings of East.</HI> For they are called <HI>Kings,</HI> both when their re∣jection and calling again are <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 24.21, 22, 23.</NOTE> prophesied of. And they are <HI>Kings of the East,</HI> as inhabiting especially the Eastern parts of the world, and rising also at their calling like the Sun, with great light and glory; as it is written, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 60.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and
<PB REF="000143_0013_0FA263948FF04E98"/>
the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee; for behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, and the</HI> Gentiles <HI>shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising.</HI> As therefore they shall come from the East, so their call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and conversion shall greatly inlighten the world, like the rising Sun which runs his race from East to West; And <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 24.27.</NOTE> <HI>as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth e∣ven to the West, so shall the coming of the Son of man be,</HI> who shall come <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 16.15.</NOTE> as a thief in the night under the sixth vial, when he shall <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4 1.</NOTE> appear at the setting up of his Kingdom with more power and glory in the world.</P>
<P>And as upon these accounts these Kings may be said to be <HI>of the East,</HI> so will their possessions and in∣heritances fall to them, especially <HI>in the Eastern</HI> parts of the world, when the Turk (who now poss∣eseth them, and who shall fall together with the Pope) shall be destroyed. But what is the prepa∣ring of the way of these Kings of the East? It is that which is prophesied of by <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 62.10, 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>Isai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h; Go thorow, go thorow the gates, prepare ye the way of the people, cast up, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st up the high way, gather out the stones, lift up a standard for the people; Behold, thy salvation cometh, behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. And they shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be call∣ed, sought out, a City not forsaken.</HI> But how is their
<PB REF="000143_0013_0FA263948FF04E98"/>
way prepared? By removing all impediments out of the way of their conversion. And what these im∣pediments are, we shall the better understand, by considering, 1. Whither the <HI>Iews</HI> shall then go. 2. What to do. Whither shall they go? <HI>viz.</HI> West∣ward, to joyn with the Churches of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in the beginning of the sixth vial, as hearing of the de∣struction of <HI>Rome,</HI> under the fifth. For then will their eyes begin to be opened to see Christ to be the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> when they shall see the most eminent judgment of God in the ruine of the seat of the Beast. After which the beast will survive for a time till the close of the sixth vial; during which inter∣val, the <HI>Iews</HI> will be stirred up to joyn with the Christian <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to effect the final ruine of spiri∣tual <HI>Babylon.</HI> To this end, their way must be pre∣pared; How? By the drying up of the waters of the great River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> i. e. By diminishing and weakning the power of the Turk, who lyeth as the great impediment in this their way. For the wa∣ters of this great River, signifie the great power of the Turk, and the vast multitudes of people under his Dominion; for thus, the numerous host of the King of <HI>Assyria</HI> is called, <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 8.7.</NOTE> <HI>the waters of the river,</HI> (viz. <HI>Euphrates) strong and many.</HI> And like as when the sixth Trumpet sounded, the four angels which were bound in the great River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> were loosed, and the num∣ber of the Army of the horsemen was <HI>two hundred thousand thousand,</HI> i. e. the power of the Turk was exceeding great: Even so, when the sixth vial (which answereth to the sixth Trumpet) is poured out, we have the contrary effect wrought, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<PB REF="000143_0014_0FA2639542FD03C0"/>
drying up of the waters of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> i. e. the great abatement of the Turkish power. God now remo∣veth this hindrance out of the way of the <HI>Kings of the East,</HI> who at present have two great impediments obstruct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng their conversion. 1. The Idolatry of <HI>Rome.</HI> 2. The power and prosperity of the Turk, the potent and professed enemy of Christianity. And though the first of these shall be removed in the ruine of <HI>Rome</HI> by the pouring out of the fifth vial upon the seat of the Beast, yet the second impedi∣ment lyeth still in the way, till by the sixth vial the waters of the great River are made foordable; and dreined so low, that the <HI>Iews</HI> may be able to wade thorow them to joyn with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to the utter overthrow both of Turk and Pope. How the power of the Turk shall be thus lessened, whether by inte∣stine commotions, or by wars from abroad, or by the prevailing of the Gospel in his Dominions upon the fall of <HI>Rome,</HI> I know not; but it is certain, that the waters of <HI>Euphrates</HI> shall be dryed up, and the way of the <HI>Kengs of the East prepared</HI>; besides which, they must be dryed up also to make way for the <HI>Iews</HI> to repossess their own Land. <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Amos</HI> 9.14, 15.</NOTE> For <HI>God will bring again the cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣vity of his people</HI> Israel, <HI>and they shall build the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Ci∣ties, and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also plant gardens, and eat the fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of them; And I will plant them</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>upon their Land, and they shall no more be pulled up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of their land which I have g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven them.</HI> And this preparing the way of these Kings, is prophesied of under the expression of <HI>drying up great waters,</HI> as when
<PB REF="000143_0014_0FA2639542FD03C0"/>
the Lord saith, <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 11.15, 16. with <HI>Isa.</HI> 51.10, 11. <HI>&amp;</HI> 54.11, 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>He will utterly destroy the tonuge of the Egyptian sea, and with his mighty wind will he shake his hand over the River, and smite it in the seven streams, and make men to go over dry-shod; and there shall be an high way for the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</HI> When the Lord delivered <HI>Israel</HI> out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he dryed the Red sea to prepare their way thorow the Wilderness into <HI>Canaan</HI>; And when he deli∣vered them out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> observe what is said a∣gain; <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 44.27, 28.</NOTE> <HI>He saith to the deep, be dry, and I will dry up the Rivers; that saith of</HI> Cyrus, <HI>He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>Thou shalt be built, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</HI> Now to these places the Holy Ghost alludeth, when it is said, <HI>The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great River</HI> Euphrates, <HI>that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4ly, There is something yet further in the Book of the Revelations pointing to the conversion of the <HI>Iews.</HI> For it is remarkable, that the <HI>Apocalips</HI> speak∣eth <HI>Hebrew</HI> three several times, though only in three words, but still in passages very applicable to the <HI>Iews.</HI> 1. It is said of the King of the Locusts (which is Antichrist) <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 9.11.</NOTE> that his name in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue, is <HI>Abaddon,</HI> but in the Greek tongue, his name is <HI>Apollyon.</HI> It is said by some of the Book of the Revelations, <HI>That
<PB REF="000143_0015_0FA26395E3069168"/>
every word is a mystery</HI>; certainly some words there∣in are so more eminently, and among others these two, <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon</HI>; both signifying, <HI>one that is a destroyer,</HI> viz. of men, such as is Antichrist; And his name is here expressed both in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek.</HI> 1. In opposition to Jesus Christ, <HI>Iesus</HI> being an <HI>Hebrew</HI> name, signifying <HI>a Saviour,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> a Greek name, signifying <HI>anointed.</HI> 2. To denote, that, as Christ is the <HI>Saviour,</HI> so Antichrist is the <HI>destroyer,</HI> both of <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI>; for so he is by his Idolatry, at which the <HI>Iews</HI> are offended, and with which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are infected. 3. To shew, that as he hath destroyed both, so he shall be de∣stroyed by both. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.3, 8.</NOTE> He is the son of perdition, and shall go into perdi∣tion. <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 17.11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, It is considerable, that the vials do answer to the Trumpets, so that what was done under the Trumpets as to the rai∣sing of Antichrist, <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="marg">To this purpose, compare <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.7. —to the end, with <HI>Rev.</HI> 16.</NOTE> is undone by the vials in order to his overthrow. The vials unravel all that sad work which was wrought by the Beast under the Trumpets. And therefore, whereas Antichrist was visibly and conspicuously placed upon his throne or seat under the fifth Trumpet, the same throne or seat of his (which is <HI>Rome</HI>) is cast down under the fifth vial; by the ruine whereof the <HI>Iews</HI> will begin to have their eyes opened, and to understand the meaning of <HI>Abaddon,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> name given him under the fifth Trumpet; And then they will be∣gin to stir, and never desist, till (at last, under the
<PB REF="000143_0015_0FA26395E3069168"/>
sixth vial) they joyn with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to destroy <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> the destroyer both of <HI>Iew</HI> and <HI>Gentile.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We have another <HI>Hebrew</HI> word, and we find it under the sixth vial, under which we have one of the clearest Revelation-proof of the <HI>Iews</HI> conversion.

<P>THat there shall be a General conversion of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> is a truth which in some mea∣sure hath been known, and believed in all ages of the Church of God, since the Apostles days.

<P>Now I must confess there are many things that <HI>stick and sway</HI> with me, so as to cause me to be very slow in condemning simple <HI>Chiliasm</HI> as erroneous. One thing is,
<PB REF="000143_0018_0FA2639C01164A30"/>
that I find it passed for current and unquestionable truth in the very next age to the Apostles. However now there are that dare affirm, that the notion of the <HI>Chiliad</HI> is Hereti∣cal, yet in the Primitive times, we read of <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg">Quidam ex his qui putan∣tur recte credidisse supergre∣diuntur <HI>ordinem</HI> Promotionis Iusto um, sed habent <HI>haereticos</HI> conceptus. <HI>Qui universam</HI> re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obant <HI>Resurrectionem,</HI> quod mirum est si <HI>nec ordinem</HI> Re∣sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctionis sciunt. <HI>Iren.</HI> Ad∣vers.

Now (as Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> observeth) this is such a Testimony of Antiquity as is absolute, the like can∣not be given again unto any extra-fundamental point of Religion.

many, yea, most of our <HI>Reforming Worthies</HI> have been against the <HI>Chiliad;</HI> yet some that have been inferi∣our to none amongst our <HI>modern Classical Authors,</HI> have esteemed <HI>Chiliasm</HI> to be no errour (much less heresie) but a Scripture truth. <HI>Alstedius</HI> is one, whose great learning and piety is known and acknowledged amongst all impartial Iudges, yet he <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg">In Diatrib. de Mille Annis Apocal.</NOTE> hath e∣laborately asserted the <HI>Chi∣liad.

It was a candid and ingenuous expression of <HI>Hieroms</HI> (however he were otherwise a bitter enemy to the <HI>Millenary</HI> opinion) that <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="marg">Licet non sequamur, ta∣men damnare non possumus; quia multi virorum Ecclesiasti∣corum &amp; Martyrum ista dixe∣runt.

<PB REF="000143_0020_0FA2639E23D80A68"/>
why learned and judicious men have looked upon the notion of the <HI>Chiliad,</HI> as Heretical, is, because some that were for that opinion, maintained that the Saints after their resurrection should again live a sensual life, in the enjoy∣ment of carnal pleasures. And truly such Doctrine as that let it be branded with the name of Heresie, and re∣jected with all abhorrency. Nevertheless to maintain that there will be heavenly and spiritual joys amongst the Saints upon earth during the great day, even <HI>Austin</HI> will ac∣knowledge to be a <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">De Civit.

<P>Again it swayeth something with me when I consider that the <HI>Chiliad</HI> was not <HI>denyed</HI> until Antichrist began to reign, and other opinions far worse than that came in the room of it. And it sticketh more with me, that the first op∣posers of <HI>Chiliasm</HI> were faign to deny the divine Apostoli∣cal Authority <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Sic Dionysius Alex. apud Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. <HI>7.</HI> c. <HI>20.</HI> Edit.

And it is not nothing with me, that those learned Worthies who wholly deny the <HI>Mil∣lenary notion,</HI> charge them with a tincture of <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Non satis longe (inquit C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>But above all, that which presseth me so, as that I can∣not gainsay (taking it in a sober and spiritual sence) the Chiliastical opinion, is, That I take these four thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Principles,</HI> and no way doubt but that they are <HI>Demon∣strable.</HI></P>

<P>There is not time here to expatiate upon these <HI>Axioms▪</HI> otherwise I could urge a multitude of things to prove them. And if they be, (or if the two first of them be) granted, <HI>Chiliasm</HI> followeth clearly and undeniably.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a <HI>summary account</HI> of what hath perswaded me to own that which is in the worlds account an incredible <HI>Paradox. Eusebius</HI> calleth it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but I trust, though the notion of the <HI>Chiliad</HI> (in the sence I accept it) be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> yet that it is not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>The truth is, I was exceeding backward to entertain
<PB REF="000143_0021_0FA263A02F366148"/>
such a notion, and did long oppose it, as conceiving it might be at best an innocent errour of some that wished well to the kingdom of Christ: But blessed be the Lord God who gave me an heart at that very time to search (according to my poor measure) the Scriptures and other Books which might be helpful in this case, both such as argued for, and such as argued against the <HI>Chiliad;</HI> and to look up to him that is in heaven and heareth on earth, that I might see and embrace the truth, and only the truth. And methinks, I would desire no more, if I could but perswade all <HI>serious and gracious</HI> men to go that way to work in this matter. But (alas) it is the great infirmity of many good men, that if any thing (though of never so circumstantial a nature, for as for fundamentals, let no one dare to question there) be voiced for an errour they fall upon it in great zeal without ever looking up to heaven, that if what they oppose be truth, they might be convinced of it, as well as if it be otherwise that they might be strengthned in bearing witness against errour, and hence the Lord never lets them see their mistakes. But as a learned and worthy Divine, <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Owen <HI>in Review of Schism against</HI> Cawdry p. <HI>36.</HI></NOTE> saith concerning <HI>Inde∣pendency</HI> (so called) for a man to search the Scrip∣tures, and other writings impartially, and to look up to him that is the fountain of light and truth for his spirit to guide into all truth, &amp;c. is a course that he would wish all men to beware of that would not be made <HI>Independents.</HI> So say I concerning that, and add withal, That it is a course I would have all men beware of that would not become sober <HI>Chiliasts.</HI></P>
<P>All this notwithstanding, I am not of their judgment who usually pass under the notion of <HI>Millenaries.</HI> For I do not think that there are any more than two personal comings or Residencies of Christ upon the earth, spoken of in
<PB REF="000143_0022_0FA263A073380B98"/>
the Scripture. Nor do I believe that Christ will reign per∣sonally upon the earth a thousand years before the day of judgment. Only I conceive, that <HI>the great and last day</HI> so much celebrated by the Prophets and Apostles, will be∣gin at the final destruction of Antichrist, even then when <HI>the thousand Apocalyptical years</HI> shall begin.</P>
<P>Neither let any one be offended with the seeming <HI>No∣velism</HI> which is in these notions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat hath been an old Artifice, whereby the enemy of truth hath kept the world from embracing of it.

Certainly new discoveries of old truths ought not to be branded with the odious name of <HI>Novel opinions.</HI> But enough was said before to wipe off the dirt of such a calum∣ny, when we shewed, that the <HI>Primitive</HI> and <HI>purest</HI> age of the Church believed the <HI>Chiliad,</HI> however now, a∣mongst some, it is deemed a new and strange Doctrine.</P>

<PB REF="000143_0023_0FA263A1223EDC68"/>
surely a good and profitable use is to be made of those wri∣tings, and <HI>solid Criticisms</HI> may be gathered from them.

<P>But I would not detain the Reader too long in the porch.

But (as far as the nature of the suctject will permit) Truths plainly delivered, are to be expected; and that (in some poor measure) I trust the Reader will find.</P>
<P>However, it is a satisfying thought unto me, when I consider, that, as it is true, if what is here asserted be found stubble when the day of fire cometh, I shall have no reward for all my pains, studies, and poor indeavours in seeking to understand, and to evince these things unto others; so on the other hand, if what I have affirmed or propounded, (for in some things which are more disputable, <HI>nihil affir∣mo, sed propono) be built upon the golden founda∣tion,</HI>
<PB REF="000143_0023_0FA263A1223EDC68"/>
then in <HI>that day</HI> (which the Lord hasten) when every man shall receive according to his works, it will not repent me of what I have publickly taught or written, nor will they that have dis-believed and opposed these Truths, then at all rejoyce in what they have in that respect done.</P>
<P>Now the Lord fit us for what ever the birth may be which his divine and holy providence is travelling with at this day. Surely there is some great thing upon the wheel, and it seemeth as if it might be said, <HI>the captive exile hastneth;</HI> Do not the signs of the times begin to shew their faces very apparently?

Do not the flouds lift up their voice? <HI>The Lord hath been opening his armoury, and bringing forth the weapons of his Indignation; a sound of Battel is in the Land, and of great de∣struction.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>NE of those great and glorious things which the world, especially, the people of God in the world, are in expectation of at this day, is, <HI>The general conversion of the</HI> Israelitish <HI>Nation.</HI> Now having a desire, whilst the hand of Christ shall continue me amongst you, to fulfil the Ministry which I have received in the Lord; I have therefore purposed with my self (by the help of the Spirit of Grace and Truth) to treat upon this subject: And so much the rather, by how much I perceive by the Word and Works of God, that the day is approaching wherein this great <HI>My∣stery
<PB N="2" REF="000143_0026_0FA263A37980CF58"/>
of God</HI> shall receive its accomplishment. And in order unto the <HI>discoursing</HI> upon this matter, the words which have been read unto you are pitched upon. For I know not any Scripture containing a more pregnant and illustrious testimony and de∣monstration of the <HI>Israelites</HI> future voca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, than this which we have before us; it being a main scope of the Apostle in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hapter▪ to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mystery unto the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And this the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>postle doth elaborately prove, by many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, both before, and in, and after this verse.

which shall <NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Videsis quae habet</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eur∣nius <HI>in Legat.

We have the proof of this prediction, and the Argument from which the Apostle proveth his prediction of <HI>Israel's</HI> salvation, is from divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stimony, (as saith he) <HI>it is written; q. d.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the word of God, that a deliverer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> away un∣godliness from <HI>Iacob,</HI> then it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> needs be true, that <HI>all Israel shall be saved</HI>; but it is so written, therefore this prediction is a most undoubted ve∣rity.</P>
<P>The words of the Text fall under the first of these particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>prediction it self.</HI> And for the opening and clearing of the words, three things may be enquired into; 1. Who are meant by <HI>Israel.</HI> 2. What by all <HI>Israel.</HI> 3. What by being saved. Q▪ 1. <HI>Who are here meant by Israel:</HI> Ans. 1. <HI>Israel</HI>
<Q>many times in the Scripture is put for those ten Tribes which revolted from the house of <HI>David</HI> unto <HI>Ieroboam</HI> in the dayes of <HI>Rehoboam.</HI></Q>
The ten Tribes are often called <HI>Samaria,</HI> the deno∣mination being from the <HI>Metropolis, Isa.</HI> 7.9. And <HI>Ephraim,</HI> because the first King over the ten Tribes was an <HI>Ephraimite,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.26. But mostly they are called by the name of <HI>Israel,</HI> the denomi∣nation being from the major part: For the ten Tribes were the greater part of <HI>Israels</HI> posterity, and therefore after the ten Tribes became a distinct kingdom, he that was King of them is stiled, <HI>The King of Israel,</HI> as the King over the two remaining Tribes is stiled <HI>King of Iudah.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. <HI>Israel</HI> is sometimes put for those that did
<PB N="4" REF="000143_0027_0FA263A42509B080"/>
remain of <HI>Iacob's</HI> posterity, after that the ten Tribes were by the <HI>Assyrians</HI> carryed into perpe∣tual captivity.</Q>
The very same persons which are sometimes called <HI>Iews,</HI> are at other times called <HI>Israelites, Mat.</HI> 10.5, 6.
<Q>Go not into the way of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor into any City of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> but unto the lost Sheep of the house of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q>
Now, <HI>the house of Israel</HI> there, doth note those that were the posterity, not so much of the <HI>Assyrian,</HI> as of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> captivity. And, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. They which are called <HI>men of Iudea,</HI> verse 14. are called <HI>men of Israel,</HI> verse 22. So <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. they who are called <HI>Iews,</HI> verse 24. are called <HI>Israel,</HI> verse 31. Hence <HI>Paul,</HI> that was a <HI>Iew</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> is al∣so said to be an <HI>Israelite, Rom.</HI> 11.1. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.22. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.5. Consider also, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.16. And the rea∣son why the <HI>Iews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re called <HI>Israelites</HI> is: 1. Be∣cause that is the more ancient and honourable name. <HI>Israel</HI> is a name of power and principality; 2. Be∣cause there were many particular persons belong∣ing to the ten Tribes who lived in the Land of <HI>Iudea.</HI> See 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 10, 17. &amp; 11.3. When <HI>Ieroboam</HI> ad∣vanced h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s superstitious worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, there were many out of all the ten Tribes who joyned themselves with those that were looked upon as <HI>Iews,</HI> in contra∣distinction to <HI>Israelites,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 11.13, 14, 16. And afterwards, in <HI>Asa</HI> his time, there was an abun∣dance of <HI>Israelites</HI> that fell from <HI>Ieroboam</HI> to the house of <HI>David,</HI> Chap. 15. verse 9. And after that, in <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> time, there were more <HI>Israelites</HI> that joyned themselves unto the house of <HI>Iudah,</HI> upon a godly letter wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch <HI>Hezekiah</HI> wrote to them to that purpose, Chap. 30. verse 6, 10, 11. And after all this, even when the seventy years of the <HI>Babylonian</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000143_0027_0FA263A42509B080"/>
captivity were expired, many of the ten Tribes (and more might have done it had they not wanted gracious hearts) returned with the <HI>Iews</HI> unto the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Consider 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36.23. with <HI>Ezra</HI> 2.70. Now the posterity of those <HI>Israelites</HI> who returned out of <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Iudea,</HI> are (as some learned conclude) <HI>the</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>twelve Tribes</HI> spoken of in the New Testament, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.7. <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.1. For they did consist not only of the Tribes of <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but there were ma∣ny Families of other Tribes amongst them, whence they might come to bear the name of twelve Tribes. See <HI>Luke</HI> 2.36. Wherefore. 3. <HI>Israel</HI> is often used
<Q>in Scripture as significant of both these, both the ten Tribes, and the two Tribes conjoyned, <HI>Psal.</HI> 114.1.</Q>
<HI>Hos.</HI> 11.1. And thus we may under∣stand <HI>Israel</HI> here in my Text. Though the two Tribes be principally intended, yet I would not interpret the words exclusively, as to the other ten Tribes, partly because it is a good rule in interpreting the Scripture, to <HI>give it the largest sence the words will bear,</HI> and partly because the ten Tribes shall be saved at last as well as the two Tribes.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>What is meant by all Israel? Answ.</HI> There are divers interpretations which have been given <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lege</HI> Voet. <HI>disp. de gene∣rali conversione Iudaeorum,</HI> p. 126, 127.</NOTE> thereof. For, 1. Some
<Q>think, that by all <HI>Israel</HI> is meant some Few of <HI>all Israel.</HI></Q>
But that cannot be the meaning of the words, for the note of universality, <HI>All Israel,</HI> will not bear such a <HI>parti∣cular</HI> restrained interpretation. That sheweth the Proposition to be an <HI>universal,</HI> and not a particular <HI>Axiom.</HI> Surely, the Scripture is not wont to use
<PB N="6" REF="000143_0028_0FA263A4F07E71A8"/>
such <HI>Akurologies,</HI> harsh improprieties of speech, as to say <HI>all,</HI> when not all but a <HI>few</HI> only are intended. Be∣sides, <HI>the Apostle opposeth</HI> that <HI>salvation of all Israel,</HI> which he predicts as future in the words of my Text, unto <HI>the salvation of a remnant,</HI> which at that present time when he wrote this Epistle to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> was accomplished, <HI>v.</HI> 5.

As if the Apostle's meaning were, that every particu∣lar person amongst the children of <HI>Israel</HI> should partake of this salvation; but in that there is a mi∣stake also.

<P>Q. 3. <HI>What is meant by being saved? Answ.</HI> In this salvation there is, 1. The term from which; 2. The term to which it shall be. 1. The term from which, <HI>viz.</HI> from a state of bondage and misery. And this is double, either, 1. <HI>Temporal</HI>; oftentimes in the Scripture, salvation is put for deliverance from temporal bondages and miseries, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.27. And this is part of the Apostles meaning here; for all <HI>Israel</HI> hath been in temporal outward bondage and misery this long time. It is now near 1600 years since the house of <HI>Israel</HI> was left unto them desolate; since which time the generality of the <HI>Iews</HI> have been in woful servitude, and hated and hissed at of all Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, in almost all places of the world, as the Lord, many hundreds of years before it came to pass, threatned them, that for their disobedience it should be, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.37. <HI>Thou shalt become an aston∣ishment, a Proverb, and a by-word amongst all Nations, whither the Lord shall lead thee.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 43. <HI>The stranger shall get above thee very high, and thou shalt come down very low.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 48. <HI>Thou shalt serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee, and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 68. <HI>You shall be sold to your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, and no man shall buy you.</HI> I remember <HI>Iosephus</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg">Of Wars of <HI>Iews, lib.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 15.</NOTE> relateth, that infi∣nite numbers of <HI>Iews</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000143_0030_0FA263A67117A080"/>
were exposed to sale at the <HI>Roman</HI> destruction of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> till at last no one would buy them; and then surely was that word of the Lord fulfilled.</P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>This salvatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> implyeth deliverance from spiritual <HI>bondage and misery.</HI></Q>
Hence in the Text it is expressed by turning away ungodliness. And salvation is very often used in the Scripture in that sence, <HI>viz.</HI> for deliverance from spiritual bondages, <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.24. <HI>Luke</HI> 1.71, 74, 77. And therefore when the Apostle saith, That <HI>all Israel shall be saved,</HI> this also is part of his meaning; That the whole nation of the <HI>Iews</HI> shall be <HI>saved</HI> from the blind∣ness of their minds, <HI>saved</HI> from the hardness of their hearts, <HI>saved</HI> from the unbelief of their souls, <HI>saved</HI> from that curse and wrath of God which lyeth upon them, and which hath remained upon many of them, for more than 2000 and divers hundreds of years.</P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>There is the term unto which this salvation shall be, <HI>viz.</HI> unto a glorious state of happiness.</Q>
And this is, 1. <HI>Temporal.</HI> The <HI>Iews</HI> who have been trampled upon by all Nations, shall shortly become the most glorious Nation in the whole world, and all other Nations shall have them in great esteem and honour, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.1, 3. <HI>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the bright∣ness of thy rising.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>This salvation implyeth spiritual and eter∣nal happiness.</Q>
Usually, salvation in the Scripture is taken in that sence, for the communication of spiritual and eternal good unto the soul, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.8, 9. Salvation implyeth grace for the soul, and glory for the soul. And this is the main thing here intended. All <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved,
<PB N="12" REF="000143_0031_0FA263A740282D28"/>
<HI>i. e.</HI> they shall be converted unto God, they shall be made partakers of much grace here, and of eter∣nal glory hereafter. The salvation of the world to come is comprehended under this saying, <HI>All Israel shall be saved.</HI> For the words may well have reference unto a speech that the <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Alludit ad dictum Hebrae∣orum,</HI> omnem Israelitam ha∣biturum partem in futuro sae∣culo. <HI>Grotius, Hoc dictum vide in Tract. Synod. c.</HI> 10. <HI>Lege Capelli obser. in N.T. p.</HI> 120.</NOTE> <HI>Hebrews</HI> made frequent use of; <HI>sc. That every</HI> Israelite <HI>shall have a part in the world to come.</HI> Therefore everlasting life, which shall be vouchsafed in the world to come, <HI>Mark.</HI> 10.30. is here intended.</P>
<P>Having thus (by the help of Christ) cleared the ground-work and foundation, the Doctrine to be raised thereupon is plainly this.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That the time will surely come, when the body of the twelve Tribes of</HI> Israel <HI>shall be brought out of their present condition of bondage and misery, into a glorious and wonderful state of salvation, not only spiritual but temporal.</HI></P>
<P>Now in the Doctrinal handling of this Truth, four things may be attended; 1. To shew that the twelve Tribes shall be saved. 2. When this salva∣tion is to be expected. 3. Why all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved. 4. What kind of salvation it is, which all <HI>Israel</HI> shall in the appointed time partake of.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are to shew, that the twelve Tribes shall be saved. And this is evident, if we consider, 1. That the two Tribes or <HI>Iews,</HI> 2. That the ten Tribes or <HI>Israelites</HI> (so distinguished in the dayes of old) shall be saved.</P>
<P N="1">1. The two Tribes or <HI>Iews</HI> shall be saved. We
<PB N="13" REF="000143_0031_0FA263A740282D28"/>
shall not here insist upon such arguments as some have stood upon. <HI>Austin</HI> layeth weight upon a typi∣cal argument, <HI>sc.</HI> That as the <HI>Gileadites</HI> rejected <HI>Iephtha,</HI> but afterwards they returned to him again; so the <HI>Iews</HI> should reject Christ, but afterwards they should embrace him. And others <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic Willet, Beza, Fagus,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> there are who lay much weight up∣on an argument drawn from the secret wonder∣ful providence of God in preserving the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation entire from mix∣tures with other Nations where they are dispersed. The providence of God hath suffered <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Lazium de Migratio∣nibus gentiam.</HI></NOTE> other Nations to have their bloud mixed very much: As you know it is with our own Nation, there is a mixture of <HI>British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman</HI> bloud; but as for the body of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation, it is far otherwise. Let an <HI>English</HI> family live in <HI>Spain</HI> five or six hundred years successively, and they will become <HI>Spaniards</HI>; but though a <HI>Iewish</HI> family live in <HI>Spain</HI> a thousand years, they do not degenerate into <HI>Spaniards,</HI> (for the most part.) It is true, that a Genealogical distinction amongst the <HI>Iews</HI> is now perished, because the <HI>Messias</HI> being come, there is not now (though before that there was) any need of such distinction, yet a National distinction there still remaineth; whence some conclude, that there will be in due time a National conversion of that people. But albeit, this argument is not to be slighted; yet I chuse rather to build upon plain Scripture-proof. Consider then, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.6, 10, 11. And <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. two last <HI>verses.</HI> Where it is clearly
<PB N="14" REF="000143_0032_0FA263A7DBF9E168"/>
intimated, that a day shall come when the desolated <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation shall account him blessed that cometh in the name of the Lord. And <HI>Luke</HI> 2.32. Christ must become <HI>the glory of his people Israel,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation. Now, they did never yet own Christ to be their glory, he was <HI>rejected of that Nation</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Chap. 17.25. there∣fore a time must come, when he shall be owned and gloried in, by that <HI>People and Nation.</HI> Consider also, Chap. 21.24. where our Saviour intimateth, that when the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> have fulfilled their times of apostacy and ini∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> shall be no longer trodden under foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by them.

And they might see this from the Prophets; for within 490 years after <HI>Cyrus</HI> his proclamation for rebuild∣ing the Temple, <HI>Messias</HI> must come, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.25. whereas it is above two thousand years since that proclamation; and Christ was to come before the utter destruction of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and in the time of the second temple, <HI>Mich.</HI> 5.2. <HI>Hag.</HI> 2.9. whereas there is no <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> nor any Temple, for many a day; why then do not the <HI>Iews</HI> acknowledge Christ?

Therefore the words are to be understood of those which at the time of the <HI>Iews</HI> future and hastning conversion, shall be their opposers and oppressors.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. The Pope, (Anti-Christ) shall be destroy∣ed before all <HI>Israel</HI> be saved.</Q>
Divines are wont to observe, that an heavy stumbling block in the way of the <HI>Iews</HI> conversion, is their judging of <HI>all Christi∣an Religion by Baptism.</HI> Now, they hate <HI>Iconolatry,</HI> i. e. the Idolatry of image worship; God hath so plagued them for that sin, that even ever since the <HI>Babylonian</HI> captivity, they have dreaded it. And there∣fore seeing such hideous Idolatry amongst the Pa∣pists, until the Lord hath born witness against Pope∣ry, and for the Reformed Religion by the destru∣ction of <HI>Rome</HI>; it is not to be expected, that the <HI>Iews</HI> will embrace the true Christian Religion. But the truth of this is further evident, if we consider, 1. That the four Monarchys must be destroyed, be∣fore the fifth or Jewish K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngdom be established, <HI>Dan.</HI> 2.44, 45. &amp; 7.21, 22, 26, 27.

That the Mystery of God shall be finished.</HI> 2.
<Q>This is further evident, because, there is no entring into the Temple before all the vials be poured forth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 15. last.</Q>
As the Priests could not enter into <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple, (1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.10, 11. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 7.8.) until the seven days dedication was over, so the <HI>Priestly Nation of</HI> Israel cannot enter into the Temple till the seven vials be poured forth. And if no man shall enter into that pure (Temple) Church-estate, which will one day be in the world, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 11.19.) until all the vials be poured forth; surely, a whole Nation cannot enter into that estate before that time.</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. The truth of this is likewise manifest, be∣cause the fifth vial shaketh <HI>Rome</HI> in pieces; where∣as the <HI>Iews</HI> are not converted till the sixth vial; yea, in the sixth vial their salvation is but begun, by clearing all obstacles out of the way, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16.10.</Q>

What is the meaning of this? It may note unto us, that after <HI>Rome</HI> is de∣stroyed, the <HI>Iews</HI> shall be brought into Christ; for <HI>Allelujah</HI> being <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> on the Vials.</NOTE> an Hebrew word, may in∣timate, that the persons therein especially con∣cerned, are <HI>Hebrews,</HI> or <HI>Israelites</HI>; as when in Chap. 9. verse 11. there is both an Hebrew, and a Greek word used; it sheweth that both <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> were therein concerned, that both of them should be poysoned with <HI>Mahumetism,</HI> and stung with <HI>Sara∣cenical</HI> locusts: So here, the Hebrew word used, may signifie that the Hebrew Nation is concerned. But when shall they say, <HI>Allelujah</HI>? the Text saith, <HI>after these things,</HI> i. e. after the pouring forth of the vi∣als full of the wrath of God upon the Antichristian world, after the destruction of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which was decribed in the fore-going Chapter. And a great <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Medes</HI> Works in <HI>Folio.</HI> p. 726.</NOTE> Interpreter hath well observed, that this manner of transition, to say, <HI>after these things</HI> is never used in the <HI>Apocalyps,</HI> but when that which fol∣loweth is in time after that which went before. Now then, if all these things be laid together, and weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, it is very evident that <HI>Rome</HI> must be destroyed before the <HI>Iews</HI> can be converted.

Now <HI>by Kings of the East,</HI> the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation may be signi∣fied; for <HI>Israelites</HI> are so called in Scripture even Kings, or a <HI>Kingdom of Priests,</HI> Exod. 19.2.

Therefore in that place be∣fore mentioned in <HI>Daniel,</HI> it is said, that tidings out of <HI>the East</HI> should trouble the (Turk) King of the North: And such a thing as this I do believe is in∣timated, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.2. where it is said, <HI>Behold the glory of the God of</HI> Israel <HI>came from</HI> the way of the East, <HI>and his voice was like the noise of many waters, and the earth shined with his glory:</HI> Consider the place, with <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.6.

considering that oftentimes in the New Testament it is said, that this and the other thing came to pass, that so there might be a literal fulfilling of such Scriptures, which yet had a mystical interpretation, as in <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.5. the <HI>Earth-quake</HI> there spoken of, is to be in∣terpreted mystically of a great shaking brought up∣on the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> in answer unto the prayers of the <HI>persecuted and martyred</HI> Saints; yet there was also at the same time a <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg"><HI>De quo Terrae-motu scri∣bit Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> l. 26. cap. 14.</NOTE> literal fulfilling of that prophesie in a most <HI>horrendous Earth-quake,</HI> which Historians make mention of.

If there should be any thing of truth in these reports, which many judicious Authors have credited, it maketh much for a literal interpretation of the place we have before us.</P>
<P>But 2. <HI>By</HI> Euphrates <HI>may be meant the Turkish Em∣pire</HI>: There are <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="marg">Confer <HI>Brightmam &amp; Medum in loc.</HI></NOTE> e∣specially two reasons which do constrain me to close with that inter∣pretation (not excluding the former.) One is be∣cause I find that in another place in the <HI>Book</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> the <HI>Turkish power</HI> is signified by <HI>Euphrates,</HI> Rev. 9.13, 14. <HI>I heard a voice saying, loose the four Angels which are bound in the great River</HI> Euphrates. The meaning of the place may be, That the Turks which lay on both sides the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and were divided into four <HI>Sultanies</HI> or Kingdoms should be let loose, partly by composing their civil dissentions, and partly by being united under one <HI>Ottomanical head,</HI> to make a dreadful irruption upon the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> Again, <HI>Euphrates</HI> is used in the Old Testament, as being significative of the <HI>Assyrian Empire,</HI> Isa. 8.7. <HI>The Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the River,</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Targum.</HI></NOTE> i. e. <HI>Euphrates,</HI> which, by way of eminency, is called <HI>the River.</HI> See 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 4.21. <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.8. &amp; 80.11. <HI>even the King of Assyria</HI>: So that you see the King of <HI>Assyria</HI> is expressed by <HI>Euphrates.</HI> Therefore the Turk being the <HI>Assyrian</HI> of the world at this day,
<PB N="34" REF="000143_0042_0FA263B82E3A7CE8"/>
may well be expressed by the same term.
<Q>So then the sum of all is, that when it is said that <HI>Euphra∣tes</HI> must be dryed up, that the way of the Kings of the East may be prepare: It noteth, that divine providence will by some means or other, bring a fatal destruction upon the Turkish Empire, in order to making the way clear for <HI>Israels</HI> salvati∣on.</Q>

Indeed to determine justly how nigh the con∣version of the <HI>Iews</HI> is; for my own part, I look up∣on it, as presumptuous and unwarrantable, for the reasons before mentioned.

unto his total ruine.

It would be too long to insist upon all the character<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the last time, which the Apostle there doth men∣tion. Only let us take notice of three or four o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, and then judge if we are not fallen into those times 1. <HI>Men shall be covetous,</HI> that's one character of the last times; if we see men laying up a world of money, and unjust gain, procured by usury, by bri∣bery, by selling Offices, and the like unrighteous practices, it giveth us sad occasion to think of this word. 2. <HI>Unthankful</HI>; when the best friends in the world are forgotten, and those that have been in∣struments of great deliverances, are requited evil for all their love; such ingratitude is a character of the last times. 3. <HI>Truce-breakers,</HI> when there are those that will promise any thing to serve their own ends, but never do as they have promised. And when the most <HI>Solemn Covenants,</HI> not only with men, but with God are made nothing of; this is what the word hath fore-told shall come to pass in the last times, 4. <HI>Traytors i. e.</HI> such as shall betray the Saints of God; for that is the Scripture notion of a Traytor, one that is false and perfidious to an in∣terest of Jesus Christ. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lege</HI> Cyprian <HI>ad Mag∣num.</HI></NOTE> Such an one as <HI>Iuda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was, is a Traytor, <HI>Luke</HI> 6.16. and such as the <HI>Pharisees</HI> were, are Traytors in the language of Scrip∣ture.

<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="000143_0044_0FA263B9332EB4F8"/>
<Q>2. That large measure of the spirit of grace which God hath given to some of his people, is a comfortable ground of hope that <HI>Israels</HI> salvati∣on is not far off:</Q>
As when salvation is near to come, men ought to be very holy, <HI>Isa.</HI> 56.1. So the Saints of God are wont to be so. When the Lord intends to bestow eminent mercy upon his people, he useth to prepare them for it, by pouring abundantly of his Spirit upon them, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.17. Now the conversion of the <HI>Iews</HI> will be an eminent mercy unto <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.15. There∣fore before that day, the Lord will refine his peo∣ple. And hath he not done so? why have the Churches of Christ been put into the furnace of late? Surely it is that they might come forth, as gold cometh out of the fire. Great tribulation is upon the Saints in other places of the world, that so they might come forth with their garments washed in the bloud of the Lamb. And doubtless, as the Lord God is hardning the wicked for the day of destruction; so he is sanctifying his people, and fitting them for a day of great salvation, by the present judgments, persecutions, and general calamities which are come, and coming upon the world.</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. The wickedness of the wicked, is grown to a monstrous height, and that is a sign it will not be long before the deliverer come unto <HI>Sion.</HI></Q>

And truly, there is rea∣son to think that the iniquity of the Antichristian world is almost full.

<Q>when the breadth, and length, and height, and depth of sin is fulfilled.</Q>
And is it not coming to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pace at this day? sin hath filled up its breadth, when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is become univer∣sal. And how doth the iniquity of the Antichristi∣an Generation abound in this respect? Have not some Lands received (if not the mark) the number of the beasts name, which once had almost wholly cast him off? Doth not Popery spread it self a∣broad, and prevail exceedingly? However to be sure, there was a time when all the world wondred after the beast. And sin hath filled up that dimensi∣on of its length when it hath been of long continu∣ance. And hath not the iniquity of Antichrist been so? It might be proved, that the Blasphemy (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Idolatry) <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.7.) of Antichrist hath conti∣nued above 1200 years. Again, sin hath filled up that dimension of its height when it is grown inso∣lent against heaven, when there is sinning with an high hand, when hideous blasphemies are spoken a∣gainst the God of heaven. Thus must it be imme∣diately before the calling of the <HI>Iews, Rev.</HI> 16.11, 12. And is it not so at this day? How do the wick∣ed blaspheme God? Do they not blaspheme prayer, and blaspheme the word? Do they not blaspheme the Son of God? Again, sin hath filled up that di∣mension of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> depth, when men are hellishly bent to do wickedly, when the sins of men are as deep as

If we see that the Antichristian party is full of malice a∣gainst God, against the Ministers of God, against the Saints of God, then know that sin is coming to its depth apace: So when the haters of the Lord are not bettered by judgments, but when the migh∣ty hand of God is lifted up they trespass yet more against the Lord.

Hence the Wo∣man of <HI>Samaria</HI> said unto our Saviour, <HI>Iohn</HI> 4.25. <HI>Messias cometh</HI> in the present Tense, <HI>doth come</HI>; and not in the future Tense, <HI>shall come; q. d.</HI> We are now all expecting such a thing as this, the time spo∣ken of by the Prophet for <HI>Messias</HI> coming is fulfilled, and therefore we conclude that now he is coming; even so when the Lord is appearing to build up <HI>Si∣on</HI> (albeit a death may come upon those expecta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ons for a while) he will raise up great hopes and
<PB N="42" REF="000143_0046_0FA263BAA2FFEA48"/>
expectations in the hearts of his people touching this matter: And that you see is strangely come to pass already, though I believe, many that have much confidence now, will ere long despair of ever seeing that which now they suppose (but very un∣reasonably as to the time) they shall see it may be the next year. Nevertheless it is not for nothing that the Lord hath raised such expectations in the world. And it is good for us from hence to draw a wise and sober encouragement unto faith and pray∣er, that the Lord would be pleased to accomplish this work so much looked for, and hasten it in its season.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. We may argue from the works of God, that the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is near to be revealed.</Q>
The present disposition of divine providence maketh it evident, that God is about some great work. And why may it not be this work, or in order to prepa∣ring things for this great day of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation? Consider well the workings of providence before this great and notable day which I am speaking of.
<Q>There must be wonders in the heavens, and in the earth bloud, and fire, and pillars of smoke, the Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the Moon into bloud, <HI>Ioel</HI> 2.30, 31.</Q>
Now when there have been terrible Comets, and many other ama∣zing prodigies visible to the world; and when Towns and Cities have been desolated with fire, and the smoke of their burning hath darkened the Sun, and made the Moon to look as red as bloud; hath not this Scripture been fulfilled? Surely these things do declare, that some notable day of the Lord is at hand. Christ's first coming was signifyed

And what if the providen∣tial coming of Christ to destroy <HI>Rome,</HI> and to convert the <HI>Iews,</HI> should be signifyed by Comets and other prodigies? The ruine of the Jewish state by the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> had <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Ioseph. de Bello. Iud.</HI> 2.7. <HI>cap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> <HI>fearful sights</HI> to fore-run it, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.11. And why may not their restauration, and the great changes which then shall come upon the world, be signifyed by the same kind of providences? Add to this, the present shakings and dashings of the Nations one against another, with that distress which is upon the earth; mens hearts failing them with expectation of what is coming, and the waves of many Nations begin to roar and lift up their voice, so must it be when the Redemption of <HI>Israel</HI> draweth nigh, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.25, 26, 27, 28.

<P N="6"><Q>6. The light of those truths which do concern the calling of the <HI>Iews,</HI> is wonderfully broken forth <HI>of late time.</HI></Q>
Not long since it seemed very paradoxical to affirm, that ever there should be a general conversion of the Jewish Nation: But that truth of late hath gained ground much throughout

the world. And albeit there have ever been some amongst the Orthodox that have in the general <HI>The∣sis</HI> concurred, that such a thing shall be in the ap∣pointed season; yet as to the glory of this day and the happy time which then shall come and conti∣nue unto the Church, there hath been little known in many ages during the reign of Antichrist: Only in these late days, these things have obtained cre∣dit, much more universally than heretofore; And that's a sign that the time of the end draweth on a∣pace, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.4, 9. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.10.</P>

<P>From the time of <HI>Israels</HI> coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> un∣to the time of their quiet possessing the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> there was the space of 46 years. Also the second Temple was 46 years in building, (<HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 20. <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ego simpliciter accipio de tempore quo extrui ab Herode Caeptum erat templum, &amp; ab ipsis fundamentis instauratum.

the 1290, and the 1335 days or years are past and gone, and that therefore no such conclusion can be grounded upon that place. Nor would I go about to determine how long this work of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation shall be in finishing after once it is begun. I love not to utter things that have not (to my own un∣derstanding at least) a solid foundation upon the Scripture: Only I say in the general, it will be the work of some years. It may be some of you may think that if this work should now begin, that then it would be all over within a few Moneths, or with∣in a year or two: but you will surely find your selves mistaken, for there are yet divers vials to be poured forth before this work be over. Now the pouring forth of a vial, doth take up a considerable space of time: Some assign <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic Author Clavis Re∣cusae.</HI></NOTE> the space of six times six (<HI>i. e.</HI> 36) years to every vial, <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Phialae aliquot saecula sibi poscunt nec pauciora quam decem.</HI> Cotterius, <HI>in Apoc.</HI> cap. 20.</NOTE> others a far larger space of time; but though those principles will not hold, yet every vial must have some considerable time for its pouring forth. For a vial is <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Sca∣pula.</HI></NOTE> a ves∣sel of large quantity with a narrow mouth; so that if a vial be full, it must have some time to be poured forth. A vial is not emptied at once in an instant, but gradually. Therefore inasmuch as there are divers vials <HI>full</HI> of the wrath of God to be poured forth between the in∣choation and consummation of <HI>Israels</HI> deliverance; it is evident, that there must a considerable space
<PB N="46" REF="000143_0048_0FA263BC217D7C80"/>
of time intervene between the beginning, and the finishing of this work.</P>
<P>Let us then consider, that there is 1. <HI>A prepara∣tory salvation</HI> of <HI>Israel.</HI> Hence we read of the way of <HI>the Kings of the East being prepared, Rev.</HI> 16.12.
<Q>See also <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.7. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together bone to <HI>his bone.</HI></Q>
When this salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> shall begin, it will make <HI>a noise,</HI> and a sound all the world over, even such a noise as shall make the Nations stand amzed. The dead bones when they begin to stir will make a ratling all the world over, <HI>and a shaking</HI>: As when the <HI>Iews</HI> were returned out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> there was a noise and a shaking, for the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Empire was shaken in pieces, and all the earth was moved at the fall thereof. Even so when the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved, <HI>Babylon</HI> shall be shaken, the Turkish Empire shall be sha∣ken, <HI>the house of Austria</HI> shall be shaken, and other Kingdoms shall be shaken; and this shaking is pre∣parative: Read the verses following. 2. There is <HI>a plenary salvation</HI> of <HI>Israel.</HI> This doth not take place till after the destruction of <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog, i. e.</HI> the Turk, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39.22. And (which will be at the same time) the utter abolition of the man of sin.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Prop.</HI> 7. When once God shall begin this work of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation, it shall be carryed on with speed and irresistible might.</Q></P>
<P N="1">"1. The work will be carryed on with speed. And this may well stand with what before was said. For that which is long in respect of us, considering our hasty expectations, is in it self speedy, <HI>Hab.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Luke</HI> 18.8. All motions when they come near their
<PB N="47" REF="000143_0048_0FA263BC217D7C80"/>
center are most swift; As an arrow that is shot out of a bow, when it cometh near unto the earth is most speedy in its motion, so it is here. Hence it is said, that the <HI>Israelites at their return shall even fly,</HI> Isay 11.14. Besides the Lord Jesus is eager in his pursuit, when once he is near unto the possession of his glorious kingdom upon earth: As Satan when he knoweth that his time is but short, he rageth ex∣ceedingly, and doth more mischief than ordinary, so may we say that the Lord Jesus will do more good in destroying the great enemies of his king∣dom, than in the ordinary course of his providence hath been known: So that Christ will do more work, and destroy more adversaries in a few years in the last times, than in many years in former days. The heart of Christ doth even long to be possessed of his kingdom, when he seeth the time is at hand. Therefore the Lord will hasten this work of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation in its season, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.22. when once the wheel is set a going, when once the Lord is upon the wing, he will come leaping over the hills like a Roe upon the mountains.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. The work shall then be carryed on irresi∣stibly.</Q></P>
<P>Heretofore there have been attempts (as here∣after may be said more abundantly) towards the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> which have all ended in miserable disappointments: But when the appointed time is come (though stops &amp; seeming-retrograde motions there may be somtimes, that is a usual method of divine providence) it shall be carryed on success∣fully at last. The Lord will pluck up the mountains by the roots when they stand in his way, <HI>Zech.</HI> 4.7. No enemies shall be able to stand before the saved

Tribes of <HI>Israel, Numb.</HI> 24.8. <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.13. For the Lord from heaven will fight for them: As when the Jewish state was destroyed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Lord did fight against them. And therefore <HI>Titus</HI> refused to be crowned for that victory <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Philostr.</HI> lib 6. cap. 14. <HI>Io∣seph. de Bello Iud.</HI> l. 7. c. 16.</NOTE> for (said he)
<Q><HI>If their God had not fought against them, I could never have overcome them</HI>:</Q>
So when the Lord shall in mercy return them to the Land of their fathers again, he will fight for them, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16.14. <HI>Hos.</HI> 1.7. <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.14.</P>
<P>And thus much may suffice for the <HI>second</HI> thing propounded to be spoken unto in the Doctrinal <HI>dis∣cussion</HI> of that great truth which we have before us. In the <HI>third</HI> place we proceed to inquire into the <HI>Reasons</HI> of this point. Why the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved? Briefly, there are such reasons as these to be assigned, why this salvation shall come to pass.</P>
<P N="1">"1. Because of the free rich grace &amp; mercy of God: This was the very reason why God took the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> to be his people at first in the days of old, when they, and they only were the Militant Church, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7.7, 8. And the same reason remaineth still to be given why the Lord will take them to be his people again. Why did not God cast off the <HI>Israelites</HI> soo∣ner? certainly they deserved it long before, but because of his own infinite grace and goodness, the Lord did not of a long time reject them. So he will not cast them off <HI>for ever,</HI> for the same reason: As the justice of God is a ground of the <HI>Israelites rejection, Rom.</HI> 11.22. So his mercy is a ground of their <HI>reception</HI> into divine favour again. Hence it
<PB N="49" REF="000143_0049_0FA263BCDFFEDF48"/>
is said, that the Lord doth this <HI>for his own sake,</HI> and not for the sake of any thing in the <HI>Israelites</HI> them∣selves, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.44. &amp; 36.32.</P>
<P>"<HI>R.</HI> 2. From the stability of Gods election, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.1. It is not possible that so much as one elect soul should miss of salvation, though all the <HI>deceivers on earth,</HI> and all the <HI>devils of hell</HI> should do their utmost to destroy such a soul, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.24. <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.12. Sure then it cannot be that an <HI>elect Nation</HI> should miss of salvation. Whence was it that some few of <HI>Israel</HI> were saved in the Apostles days, and not others as well as they? This was the reason, because some belonged to <HI>e∣lection,</HI> which others did not, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7. And this is one reason which the Apostle giveth in this Chapter, verse 28. to prove that a time will come when all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved, <HI>viz.</HI> because of <HI>electi∣on.</HI> Consider <HI>Iohn</HI> 10.16.</P>
<P>"<HI>R.</HI> 3. <HI>Taken from the power of God:</HI> This also is another reason given by the Apostle in this Chap∣ter, to prove that the <HI>Israelites</HI> shall again be taken into Covenant with God, notwithstanding their pre∣sent rejection, because verse 23. <HI>God is able to graff them in again.</HI> And that God is able to do this diffi∣cult (and to nature and reason impossible) work, is proved in verse 24. from the calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> if (saith the Apostle) God hath called the <HI>Gentiles, and so contrary to nature graffed that which was wild into the good Olive tree</HI>: Sure then he is able to graff the <HI>Israelites, which are the natural branches into their own Olive tree:</HI> But God hath called the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> there∣fore he is able to call the <HI>Iews</HI> again to become his people, therefore this shall be done.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="000143_0050_0FA263BDD93EAD50"/>Yea verily, such is the infinite power of <HI>Ieho∣vah,</HI> that he is able to bring this mighty work to pass by a beck of his finger. Hence it is said, <HI>Zech.</HI> 10.8. <HI>I will hiss for them and gather them</HI>: The Lord can as easily gather the dispersed <HI>Israelites</HI> out of all corners of the earth, as a man can hiss, or whistle, or call a creature that will come to him with the beck of his hand. Such is the power of the great God. Alas, there are many in the world that these things seem incredible unto; but as the Apostle said to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.8. <HI>Why should it be thought a thing in∣cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible with you that God should raise the dead?</HI> So I say in this case, why should it be thought a thing in∣credible, that God should raise the dead <HI>Iews</HI> out of the grave of sin and utter darkness, and that he should breathe the breath of life into those dry and dead bones? Indeed if the work were to be done by men or Angels, or any creature alone, well might it be thought a thing incredible: But inasmuch as the great God, to who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing is or can be too hard, (inasmuch as he who hath made heaven and earth) hath engaged his omnipotency to bring this work to pass, most certainly it shall be accomplished in the appointed time.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Reas.</HI> 4. That so the divine Prophesies of the Scripture <HI>may be fulfilled.</HI></Q>
It must needs be that what ever God hath spoken by his holy Prophets should be accomplished, <HI>Isa.</HI> 44.6. Hence divers times in the Scripture it is said, that this and the o∣ther thing came to pass, that so that might be fulfil∣led which was befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> spoken by the Prophets. See <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.23. &amp; 13.14, 34, 35. &amp; 26.54, 56. Now the Prophets have spoken concerning this salvation of the Tribes of <HI>Israel: This mystery of God hath been
<PB N="51" REF="000143_0050_0FA263BDD93EAD50"/>
declared by the Prophets,</HI> Rev. 10.7. Yea the truth is, that all the Prophets which have written since the world began have spoken more or less concerning this matter; for this you may see an express place of Scripture, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.21, 24. And let any man unto whom God hath given understanding, impartially search the writings of the Prophets, and he shall find that this was their great design, to fore-tell the glo∣ry of <HI>Messias</HI> his kingdom, which will appear after all <HI>Israel shall be saved.</HI> The truth is, that there is not any one prophetical book (the book of <HI>Ionah</HI> is rather an History than a Prophesie) in all the Scri∣pture, be it in Old Testament or in New, which doth not speak something concerning the salvation of <HI>Israel.</HI> Therefore this must needs be brought to pass.</P>
<P>"<HI>R.</HI> 5. Because of the Covenant of God. This also is another reason used by the Apostle in this Chapter, to prove that all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved, ver. 27.28. And the strength of that argument lyeth in this, that the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God is <HI>everlasting.</HI> Hence it is said, verse 25. <HI>Blindness is hapned unto Israel but in part,</HI> i. e. their blindness is <HI>neither universal</HI> (for a remnant were saved in the Apostles days, verse 5.) <HI>nor perpetual</HI>; for because of Gods everlasting Co∣venant, this blindness shall not be everlasting blindness. And if we observe the Scripture, we shall find, that the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is still ground∣ed upon Gods Covenant. See <HI>Levit.</HI> 26.42. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.60. <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.11.</P>

<P><PB N="54" REF="000143_0052_0FA263441BBCDC50"/>Now in this respect <HI>Israels</HI> salvation may well be esteemed glorious, for the Land of <HI>Iudah</HI> is in Scripture language <HI>a glorious Land,</HI> as being indeed a Type of heaven, the place of everlasting glory.

<P N="3"><Q>3. The salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> will be glorious, in respect of the continuance of their happiness, when once this great work is brought unto per∣fection.</Q></P>
<P>Justly how long this glorious day shall continue, is not for us to say, for therein the Scripture is si∣lent; Only it is evident, that it will be for Genera∣tions one after another. If you look into that place in the Prophet, from whence the Apostle taketh the words of my Text (<HI>viz. Isa.</HI> 59.20, 21.) you will see that <HI>the saved state of Israel</HI> must continue at least for three Generations. See also <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.25. yea this glory will continue for many Generations, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.15. Hence <HI>the new heavens and the new earth,</HI> which God will create when the salvation of all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be consummate, is said (not to be for a while, and so to pass away, but) <HI>to remain</HI> before him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.22. Yea this glorious state and condition of <HI>Israel</HI> is said <HI>to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st for ever,</HI> partly because they shall never more be brought into the hands of any oppressors, and partly because this their glory will be of very long continuance, <HI>Ioel</HI> 3.20.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="58" REF="000143_0054_0FA2634DF56887F8"/>
<Q>4. This salvation of the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> will be glorious unto them, inasmuch as the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation shall then be acknowledged and respect∣ed in the world above any other Nation or peo∣ple.</Q>
Consider <HI>Zech.</HI> 8.22, 23. &amp; 9.16. <HI>Ier.</HI> 22.8. <HI>Isa.</HI> 61.5, 9. &amp; 14.1, 2. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3. last. <HI>Mic.</HI> 4.8. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.61.</P>
<P>And there is good reason why it should be thus, 1. Because they are as it were the Eldest Brother, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.25. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.22. <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.27. The <HI>Iews</HI> were the people of God before the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> There was a time when they were the only Church upon earth, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.2. <HI>Iohn</HI> 4.22. So that the <HI>Gentile</HI>-Church which now is, is <HI>surrogate Israel,</HI> Rom. 11.17. and is therefore often called <HI>Israel</HI> in the book of <HI>Revelation.</HI> It is also observable, that the first Christian Church which ever was in the world did consist wholly of <HI>Iews, Rom.</HI> 1.16. <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.5, 6. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.46. &amp; 1.15.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. Because the <HI>Messias,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world according to his humane nature, was <HI>an Israelite,</HI> Gen. 12.3. <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.16.</Q>
And of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> Heb. 7.14. <HI>It is evident</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>that our Lord sprang out of Iudah</HI>: Al∣though now the <HI>Iews</HI> have raised great controver∣sies about the Genealogy of Christ, yet in those days it was so manifest that Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> was sprung from <HI>Iudah,</HI> that no <HI>Iews</HI> (although such as denyed that Jesus was the Christ) could ever deny that he came of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah</HI>;
<Q>Therefore the Apostle saith, that it is <HI>evident,</HI> our Lord came of <HI>Iudah, q. d.</HI> no man doubteth of that.</Q>
For <HI>Messias</HI> came from the house of <HI>David, Acts</HI> 2.30. therefore he was of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah</HI>: And this is manifest, if
<PB N="59" REF="000143_0054_0FA2634DF56887F8"/>
we compare <HI>Matthews</HI> and <HI>Lukes</HI> Genealogy of Christ. <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of Christ was of the house of <HI>David. Eli</HI> was <HI>Marys</HI> natural father, for he was <HI>Iosephs</HI> legal Father (or Father-in-law) <HI>Luke</HI> 2.23. which is evident, because <HI>Iacob</HI> was <HI>Iosephs</HI> natural Father, <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.16. Therefore <HI>Mary</HI> being <HI>Elie</HI>'s Daughter, was naturally descended from the line and loins of <HI>David</HI>; Therefore Christ sprang of <HI>Iudah.</HI> It is true indeed, that Christ descended from <HI>Ruth,</HI> who was a <HI>Moabitess,</HI> to signifie that <HI>Gentiles</HI> should by him be saved as well as <HI>Iews,</HI> but the rest of his Predecessors were <HI>Israelites.</HI> Now this is the greatest thing which the <HI>Iews</HI> have to glory in, and that which maketh the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation to be above others desirable, <HI>Hag.</HI> 2.7. Therefore the Apostle speaking of the priviledges and glories which the <HI>Israelites</HI> had above other people, mentio∣neth this in the last place, as being more than all o∣ther things that may be said or thought of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.5. As it is true, that the humane nature is exalted a∣bove the Angelical nature in respect of Christ, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.20, 21. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.15. because it may be said that Christ is a man, but not that Christ is (in respect of nature) an Angel; So, in respect of Christ, the Jewish Nation is exalted above every Nation, be∣cause it may be said that Christ was an <HI>Israelite,</HI> but not that he was of any other Nation.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. This salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> will be glorious in∣asmuch as the Lord Jesus Christ shall then possess his Davidical <HI>kingdom.</HI></Q>
If we search the Scrip∣tures, we shall find that there is a threefold king∣dom of Christ. 1. <HI>Providential,</HI> whereby he gover∣neth the world, in respect whereof he is called <HI>the King of Nations,</HI> Jer. 10.7. See <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.18.

Sure then the meaning of the place is not, that ever <HI>Sodom</HI> shall be restored again; Is it then that the <HI>Iews</HI> shall never be converted? No, for that is con∣trary to more than a thousand Scriptures: But by <HI>So∣dom,</HI> the <HI>Gentiles</HI> may be signified, and by <HI>Samaria</HI> the ten Tribes; so that the meaning may be, that when the Lord will have mercy on the <HI>Iews,</HI> he will also have mercy on the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and on the ten Tribes. Therefore <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> do very well agree; for <HI>Paul</HI> saith, that when all <HI>Israel</HI> is saved, a fulness of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall come in; And <HI>Ezekiel</HI> saith, that when <HI>Sodom</HI> shall be brought out of the captivity of Satan and powers of darkness, then shall the <HI>Iews</HI> have an happy and glorious day. <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations will be so affected with the power of God appear∣ing in the conversion and restitution of the <HI>Iews,</HI> as that they will thereupon become the Lords people, <HI>Ier.</HI> 16.19.

I say then, it is an holy truth, that after the <HI>salvation</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> is <HI>consummate,</HI> the state and face of things will be quite altered through the world. Hence it is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.1. <HI>That when New Ierusalem cometh down from heaven, there shall be no more Sea</HI>: i. e. ei∣ther
<PB N="65" REF="000143_0057_0FA263502938E6F8"/>
there shall be no more corruptions in Religi∣on, or (which interpetation suiteth with the Prophe∣tical notion of Sea) the meaning is, that there will be no more such troubles and combustions, moti∣ons and commotions, dreadful shakings and confu∣sions, as shall be in the world a little before the <HI>Iews</HI> conversion; but all things shall be quiet, and and calm, and peaceable, and days of glorious tran∣quility throughout the earth. Hence it is said in the same verse, <HI>that there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth</HI>: i. e. a new state and face of the world. As this present state of the world is called <HI>a new world</HI> in respect of that which was before the floud, which is termed <HI>the old world,</HI> so the state of things after the consummation of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation, may in respect of this present state of the world be termed, <HI>a new world</HI>; for the world will then as far excel (and more) what the world now is, as the world at pre∣sent doth come short of what it was before the floud. Hence the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> saith, 2 <HI>Ep. chap.</HI> 3. <HI>ver.</HI> 13.
<Q>we, according to his promise, expect a new hea∣ven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth <HI>righteous∣ness.</HI></Q>
This cannot be meant meerly of the new Gospel-dispensation, because that was already come, whereas the Apostle speaketh of this as fu∣ture, as a thing under expectation, and not under present fruition: Nor can it be meant of the state of glory in heaven, because the Apostle saith, <HI>accor∣ding to his promise,</HI> which promise is in <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.17. and that speaketh expresly concerning a state here upon earth. Consider verse 21. Therefore the crea∣tion of the new heaven and earth, noteth a glorious renewal of this inferiour world; and therefore it is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.5. <HI>Behold I make all things new:</HI> Now
<PB N="66" REF="000143_0058_0FA2635102BFEB20"/>
many times things are altered for the worse, and not for the better; seldom hath there been any great reformation in the Church, but a sad after-clap hath come, that so that reformation might be seal∣ed with suffering: After that Paganry was over∣thrown by <HI>Constantine,</HI> then came a <HI>Iulian,</HI> who set it up again: And, you know that in our own Nati∣on after that Popery was pulled down by our <HI>En∣glish Iosiah</HI> (as he is usually and deservedly called) there came dark and bloudy <HI>Marian</HI> days, wherein Popery had another turn like the blaze of a snuff a little before utter extinction, but when <HI>Israels</HI> sal∣vation is consummate, the alteration will be no more for the worse, but for the better only. Now the truth of this will be evident, if you consider that those two principal things which put all the world out of order, shall then cease.
<Q>For 1. <HI>One thing</HI> which puts all the world out of order is conten∣tion and division, <HI>Iam.</HI> 3.16.</Q>
But when once the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is accomplished, the contentions and bitter strifes of men will be at an end. For the <HI>Israelites</HI> shall have unity and unanimity amongst themselves, <HI>Isa.</HI> 11.13. <HI>Ier.</HI> 32.39. Nor shall there be such schisms and divisions amongst <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches as hitherto hath been, to the infinite scan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of Christian Religion. Before Popery got up, Christians were miserably divided amongst them∣selves, that Pagans were wont to deride them upon their publick Theaters for their divisions and con∣tentions one with another. And, since the Refor∣mation, what woful and most sinful heart-burnings have there been amongst the professors of a more pure Religion. Though <HI>the Reformation</HI> in respect of purity of Doctrine hath been a <HI>Sea of glass,</HI> yet in re∣spect
<PB N="67" REF="000143_0058_0FA2635102BFEB20"/>
of contentions (as well as persecutions from adversaries) amongst themselves, it hath been <HI>mingled with fire,</HI> Rev. 15.2. But after <HI>Israels</HI> sal∣vation there will be no more of this; <HI>For there shall be one Lord, and his name one,</HI> and that <HI>over all the earth,</HI> Zech. 14.9. one shall not say, I am a <HI>Calvi∣nist,</HI> and another I am a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> another I am th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and another I am that; Such carnal schisms shall then be at an end.
<Q>2. Another thing which bring∣eth confusion upon the face of the world, is that desolating sin of <HI>persecution.</HI></Q>
Observe the Scrip∣ture, and you shall find, that when God hath brought desolating and astonishing plagues upon the earth, it hath been chiefly for the sin of persecution. Hence come <HI>overturnings, overturnings, overturnings,</HI> hence come Wars, Plagues, Famines, Fires, and eternal desolations. What was that sin which ruined the four Monarchies? It was the sin of persecution. See <HI>Ier.</HI> 50.17, 18. <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.9, 12, 13, 14. And what was that sin which brought like a whirlwind of the Lord, destruction upon the Jewish state and Nation, and that long, and lasting, and most doleful ruine which continues to this day? It was because they perse∣cuted his Saints, and stopped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mouths of his mes∣sengers, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, 16. But after <HI>Israels</HI> sal∣vation is consummate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more persecution shall be heard of in the world, no not for a thousand years together. Nay, the Saints shall never more be de∣livered into the hands of persecutors after this glo∣rious day, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 28.24. &amp; 45.8. The <HI>Iews</HI> of old were not to have any fire upon the Sabbath day, which might singnifie unto us, that, in that glorious <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> that rest for the people of God, which shall one day be upon this earth, there will be free∣dom
<PB N="68" REF="000143_0059_0FA26351A2964F20"/>
from fires of contention and persecution▪ And this is manifest
<Q>1. Because persecution is from the Devil.</Q>
It is he that stirreth up wicked instru∣ments to molest the Servants of God for Righte∣ousness sake, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.18. Now Satan must be bound for a thousand years, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.1, 2, 3. "2. Because persecution is from Antichrist. The Devil and the Pope are the two great Authors of persecution. Look into the world, and you shall find, that where Saints are persecuted <HI>(i. e.)</HI> suffer for Righteousness) it is caused by Antichrist, or some Limb or Horn of Antichrist: But Antichrist shall be utterly destroyed (as hath been shewed) when the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be consummate. There∣fore when the beast shall be slain, and his body gi∣ven unto the burning flame, there will be no more destruction in all the Lords holy mountain.</P>
<P>Thus have you heard the first particular, as to the kind and manner of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation, <HI>viz.</HI> that it will be <HI>glorious.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Secondly, the salvation of all the Tribes of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> will be <HI>wonderful</HI> as well as glorious.</Q>
And although it be true that what hath been said concern∣ing the glory of this day, doth sufficiently evince that it will be <HI>a wonderful day,</HI> nevertheless because I would not multiply too many particulars under one general head, therefore for methods sake, I chuse to mention this, as a distinct head from the for∣mer. And the truth of this is further evident;
<Q>1. Because the Scripture doth plainly express as much as this cometh to. <HI>scil.</HI> that the day of <HI>Is∣raels</HI> salvation will be a wonderful day, <HI>Ioel</HI> 2.26.</Q>
<HI>You shall praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you,</HI> and verse 30. <HI>I will shew
<PB N="69" REF="000143_0059_0FA26351A2964F20"/>
wonders</HI> saith God, speaking concerning this very time of <HI>Israels</HI> conversion and salvation. Hence that day is called <HI>a great day,</HI> because God will then do great and wonderful things, such as the like shall not be again, <HI>Hos.</HI> 1. last, <HI>great shall be the day of Iezreel</HI>: By the day of <HI>Iezreel,</HI> is meant especially the day when the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved. Now this is said to be a great day, because then God will take unto himself his great power, and shew the <HI>greatness</HI> of his being, and holy Attri∣butes, in working <HI>great</HI> deliverances, and in de∣stroying <HI>great</HI> enemies, and so as to cause <HI>great ad∣miration</HI> in the world. And hence also this salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is called a <HI>Mystery,</HI> as in the verse before my Text, <HI>I shew you</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>a Mystery, that blindness is in part hapned to</HI> Israel, <HI>till the fulness of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>be come in, and so all</HI> Israel <HI>shall be saved.</HI> So that the mystery which the Apostle speaketh of is not only (as some have restrained the words) that blindness is hapned to <HI>Israel</HI>; Albeit that is in∣deed a very mysterious thing, that they, which were once the people, and the only people of God, should be rejected by him for so long a time, well might the Apostle, even in that respect break forth into such an holy extasie and admiration, saying, <HI>O the depth both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how are</HI> his judgments unsearchable, <HI>and his ways past finding out</HI>? but that's not all the mystery; It is likewise <HI>a wonderful mystery,</HI> that this blindness, which is hap∣ned to <HI>Israel,</HI> should only be a partial, and not an eternal blindness, that this blindness should last no longer than till the <HI>Gentiles</HI> have fulfilled their time; And that then <HI>all</HI> Israel <HI>should be saved</HI>: This is the wonder of wonders. As the conversion of
<PB N="70" REF="000143_0060_0FA263528BF700E8"/>
the <HI>Gentiles</HI> was a mystery made known unto the <HI>Iews, Eph.</HI> 3.9. So the conversion of the <HI>Iews</HI> is a mystery made known unto the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; yea, it is a most excellent admirable mystery; therefore it is called <HI>the mystery of God,</HI> Rev. 10.7. <HI>When the se∣venth Angel shall sound the Trumpet,</HI> the mystery of <HI>God shall be fulfilled:</HI> The mystery of God in that place may note the reversion of the Children of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> unto the Land of their Fathers, and their con∣version, together with the restauration of all things to their first glory. Now, why is it called, <HI>the my∣stery of God</HI>? Is not this one reason of it, to signifie unto us the <HI>divineness,</HI> and admirable excellency of the mystery? It's an usual <HI>Hebraism</HI> in the Scrip∣ture to express a thing that is superlatively excellent and admirable by the name of <HI>God.</HI> Thus we read of <HI>harps of God, and mountains of God,</HI> and <HI>Cedars of God</HI>: i. e. very excellent ones, so <HI>the mystery of God,</HI> i. e. a most excellent mystery. And therefore this salvation will be wonderful. For <HI>a mystery is</HI> as much as to say, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mysterium est sacrum se∣cretum occultam hauens intelli∣gentiam.

Now thus may we say of the conversion of the twelve Tribes, that men had never once imagi∣ned, that such a thing should come to pass, had not the word and spirit of God revealed it.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. It is a wonderful thing, that ever the <HI>Israe∣litish</HI> Nation should be preserved in the world, through so many and stupendious changes as have attended that afflicted Nation.</Q>
The truth is, that never any Nation upon earth was under so dreadful an hand of God, so sore, and of so long continu∣ance, as the Jewish Nation hath been, and is: This and more is affirmed by our Saviour, <HI>Matt.</HI> 24.21. <HI>For there shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor ever shall be</HI>: So that this last and most grievous tribulation of
<PB N="72" REF="000143_0061_0FA263532544CD50"/>
the Jewish Nation. It is not only the greatest ca∣lamity that ever did befal any Nation since the world began, but the greatest that ever shall befal any people to the worlds end, that indeed one might wonder that ever the Nation should be up∣held in being in the midst of such wasting and woful judgments; Therefore it is added, verse 22. <HI>Except those days should be shortned, no flesh should be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be shortned:</HI> The mean∣ing is, that such direful vengeance and wrath will befal the Jewish Nation, that were it not that there is an elect seed to proceed out of their Loins in due time to be called, that whole carnal Nation would be utterly destroyed. Consider <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.8. Besides, there never was any Nation guilty of such prodigi∣ous wickedness as the Jewish Nation hath been guilty of, whereby they have infinitely provoked the most high to cast and cut them off for ever.</P>
<P>I remember a writer of their own <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosephus</HI> of Wars of <HI>Iews.</HI> lib.</NOTE> saith,
<Q>That at the time when the <HI>Romans</HI> came and destroyed <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the people were so wicked, that he doth believe (he saith) that if the <HI>Romans</HI> had not come to lay them desolate, God would have sent fire down from heaven to have consu∣med them, as he did <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI></Q>
But why speak I of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI>? for the wick∣edness of <HI>Sodom</HI> was not comparable, to the wicked∣ness of the <HI>Iews.</HI> Nay it is not possible for any crea∣ture, no not for the Devils themselves to be guilty of a greater wickedness, than the whole Nation of the <HI>Iews</HI> was guilty of, when they rejected and cru∣cifyed the Lord of life and glory. And yet for all
<PB N="73" REF="000143_0061_0FA263532544CD50"/>
this (which is a <HI>wonderful</HI> thing) the providence of God hath so ordered, that this people doth not cease to be a Nation, no, nor ever shall do. We may therefore say, that concerning the Jewish Nation, which we cannot positively and infalliby affirm of any other particular Nation under heaven. <HI>scil.</HI> that it shall continue in being to the end of the world, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31.36. <HI>Thus saith the Lord that giveth the Ordi∣nances of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, if these Ordinances depart from before me saith the Lord, then the seed of</HI> Is∣rael <HI>shall cease from being a Nation before me for ever</HI>: The meaning is, that they shall never cease to be a Nation as long as the Sun and Moon endureth, as long as heaven and earth remain undisolved, as long as the frame of nature is kept from ruine: And this I take to be the genuine Interpretation of those words, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.34. <HI>Verily I say unto you, that this Nation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled:</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>pro gente usurpa∣tur</HI> Matth. 24.34. <HI>Leigh Crit.

No saith Christ, all that misery which you have heard of shall come upon the <HI>Iews,</HI> and after this, the son of man shall appear unto their conversion: And after this all the elect of God shall be called, and gathered together unto Christ, that are in the four quarters of the earth, Verily I say unto you, all this shall be before the Jewish Nation shall cease to be a Nation. Now this is won∣derful!</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. It is evident, that this salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> will be wonderful, because men are so unapt to believe it.</Q>
The truth is, that there is a natural a∣versness in the hearts of sinful men from giving due respect and credence to prophetical Scripture; such is the lamentable corruption of mens nature, that they are more apt to be taken with fond, foolish, false prophesies that have nothing of a divine inspi∣ration in them, than with the blessed and holy pro∣phesies contained in the Scriptures of truth, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.25. <HI>He said unto them, O fools, &amp; slow of heart to be∣lieve all</HI> that the Prophets <HI>have spoken</HI>! So that even the Disciples of Christ may be slow of heart to be∣lieve the <HI>things spoken by the Prophets.</HI> Yea, I am per∣swaded that it is one of the greatest sins of many that truly fear God, that they are so slow and neg∣ligent in searching into <HI>the things spoken by the Pro∣phets.</HI> Now this salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is a principal
<PB N="75" REF="000143_0062_0FA26353DB0999B0"/>
<HI>thing spoken of by the Prophets</HI>: Yea, all the Prophets have said something concerning this very thing; therefore men are slow to believe here. We may say concerning the salvation of the Jewish Nation, as was said of their destruction by the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> Hab. 1.5. <HI>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard and won∣der marvellously, for I will work a work in your days, which you will not believe though it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e told you.</HI> Even so when the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> is come out of <HI>Sion,</HI> the Lord will work such a work as that the <HI>Gentile</HI> Na∣tions shall wonder marvellously; yea, it will be such, that men will not believe it though they be told of it before-hand, and told of it too from the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Iews</HI> were very slow in believing the con∣version of the <HI>Gentiles, Acts</HI> 10.45. They of the <HI>circumcision were astonished because that on the</HI> Gentiles <HI>also was poured the gift of the holy Ghost</HI>: what? that the spirit of grace should be given to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> it was <HI>wonderful,</HI> even to astonishment. See also chap. 11. ver. 18. <HI>When they heard these things, they glorifyed God, saying, Then also hath God granted to the</HI> Gentiles <HI>repentance unto life, q. d.</HI> here's a strange thing in∣deed come to pass, here's such a thing as we little imagined, but men ever thought the contrary; what? that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> should have repentance to life given them. So the truth is, that <HI>Gentiles</HI> are too slow to believe the conversion of the <HI>Iews.</HI> Some there are that will not so much as believe the thing, that ever such a thing shall come to pass whilst the world standeth. Others there are that do believe the thing, but as to the manner of it, and that glory which shall follow, there they are at a stand, and know not how to believe; others again believe
<PB N="76" REF="000143_0063_0FA26354A4E2AC38"/>
both that the thing will be, and also that it will be a very glorious day, but as to the time when this shall be, they are exceedingly in the dark, they can∣not think that it will be so soon, as most certainly it will be: The time surely draweth on apace (as hath been shewed) and yet there are that do not be∣lieve that it will be these many score; nay, some hundreds of years. Thus are men, one way and another way, dis-believing concerning this great truth. Hence it is that so much is spoken of this matter in the holy Scriptures. I have many times thought on it with admiration that there is not any one thing in all the word of God more abundantly witnessed unto than this truth, <HI>that all</HI> Israel <HI>shall be saved</HI>: What should be the reason of that? doubt∣less there are divers reasons for it; one is, because the Lord would not, by any means have his people ignorant of this great truth:
<Q>Therefore the Apostle saith, Brethren I would not have you ig∣norant that blindness is hapned to <HI>Israel,</HI> only till the <HI>Gentiles</HI> have fulfilled their times, and that then all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved; men are apt to think with themselves it is no great matter, though they be ignorant in such truths as these are, as being truths of a lesser concernment, and the men of the world are ready to think with themselves, what should they trouble themselves so about the conver∣sion of the <HI>Iews</HI>?</Q>
But now God would not have such a spirit as that to be in his people; therefore the Lord layeth wait upon this point, and cometh over and over with it many an hundred time by his spirit in the mouths of his Prophets. Again, ano∣ther reason why there is so much said in the Scrip∣ture concerning this salvation of <HI>Israel,</HI> may be, be∣cause
<PB N="77" REF="000143_0063_0FA26354A4E2AC38"/>
it is that which men are most unapt to believe, I cannot think the spirit of God would so often in∣culcate this truth, if there were not such a reason as that for it: And why, think you, are men so unapt to believe this truth? but because of the strangeness and wonder that is in it; It is a thing beyond humane sence and reason.</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. It is evident, that the salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> will be wonderful, if we compare it with those former deliverances which in the days of old have been vouchsafed unto the Tribes of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q>
It is indeed true, that God hath in former times bestow∣ed more eminent and wonderful salvations upon the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation that upon any Nation in the world, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.20. <HI>He hath not dealt so with any Nation.</HI> It is true, in respect of deliverances and salvations which were vouchsafed unto them, as well as in respect of the Covenant, and Word, and Or∣dinances of God which were bestowed on them, that God dealt not so with any Nation as with the <HI>He∣brew</HI> Nation; nevertheless, this salvation which we are now speaking of as <HI>yet to come,</HI> will be more wonderful than any of those former which hereto∣fore have been. That deliverance of the <HI>Iews</HI> by <HI>Cy∣rus</HI> out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> was very wonderful, yet nothing so wonderful as this will be, as is evident, because that was but a Type of this, and therefore it is, that in many places in the Scripture, the very same ex∣pressions are used to signifie both that deliverance out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and this which is to come; so the Vision of the dry bones in <HI>Ezekiel</HI> doth firstly refer to the <HI>Iews</HI> captivated in <HI>Babylon,</HI> but principally to the forlorn estate of the <HI>Iews</HI> at this day, and the like may be said concerning many passages in other
<PB N="78" REF="000143_0064_0FA2635575361200"/>
of the Prophets, that they do firstly concern the <HI>Babylonian</HI> condition of the <HI>Iews,</HI> but lastly their pre∣sent condition; but because that deliverance was a Type of this, therefore this will be the more emi∣nent and wonderful, for the Type must needs come short of the Anti-type.</P>
<P>Again, when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were brought up out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> it was a very wonderful delive∣rance; for God did then cause many great signs, and wonders, and miraculous demonstrations of his power and providence to be seen: Read <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.11, 12. <HI>He shewed them wonders, mavellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and in the field of</HI> Zoan; what wonders, what marvel∣lous things? verse 12, 14, 19. <HI>He divided the Sea, and caused them to pass through, and he made the waters to stand as an heap, in the day time he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light fire, he clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths</HI>: And so the Psalmist goeth on to shew what won∣ders the Lord did for the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> when he brought them out of <HI>Egypt.</HI> And I am perswad∣ed that God, whose ways are everlasting, when the time cometh that all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved, will do as great and glorious (yea greater) wonders <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hinc i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lud Iudaeorum,</HI> om∣nia priora miracula ad Messiae miracula, nihil erunt. <HI>Ac illud, quae</HI> diebus postremis fient mi∣racula, ad miracula Aegypti, ut substantia ad accidens, sese ha∣bebunt. <HI>Vide Midrash Cohe∣lesh. c.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp; Talmud. in Tract.

<Q>1. Because the <HI>Israelites</HI> are more scattered now than when they were in <HI>Egypt,</HI> even <HI>into all Coun∣trys are they driven,</HI> as it is there said:</Q>

people under the Cope of heaven again, as are the <HI>Iews,</HI> I say the salvation of such a dispersed Na∣tion, is more wonderful, than the salvation of a Nation that are together; therefore this delive∣rance will be more wonderful than that out of <HI>E∣gypt</HI> was.
<Q>2. The present affliction which doth abide the Jewish Nation, hath been of far longer continuance than their <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage was.</Q>
For they were in <HI>Egypt</HI> but <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ioseph. Antiq.</HI> lib. 3. chap. 6.</NOTE> about 215 years, whereas their present misery hath lasted 215 years seven times told and more, therefore this salvation will be more wonderful than that out of <HI>Egypt</HI> was.
<Q>3. Notwithstanding that deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> they were subject unto captivities and calamities one upon the back of another, but, after this deliverance, they shall never be brought into bondage again any more at all, <HI>Ioel</HI> 3.17.</Q>

Whether there will not be a particular re∣surrection soon after the <HI>Iews</HI> conversion, is a con∣troversie that I intend not here to meddle with, on∣ly it is certain, that the ultimate, universal resur∣rection from the dead will not be till long after that. Nevertheless it is true, that <HI>the salvation of Is∣rael</HI> is described by expressions taken from the re∣surrection of the last day, to signifie unto us that it will be such another wonderful work of God as that is. What more wonderful than that the bodies of men which have been dead and rotting in their graves for ages, after-ages, should be raised, and brought to life again? This is a mighty wonder: even so that the Jewish Nation, which have been perishing in a cruel grave, and there lain dead for many hundreds of years, to be made alive again, to say the least of it, it is a wonder. See the Scripture here a little, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.12, 13. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God behold, O my people,</HI> I will open your graves, <HI>and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d cause you to come up out</HI> of your graves, <HI>and bring you into the Land of</HI> Israel, <HI>and ye shall know that I am the Lord,</HI> when I have opened your graves, <HI>O my people, and brought you</HI> up out of your graves.
<Q>Mark how the Lord insists upon this, <HI>out of your graves, out of your graves, out of your graves, out of your graves</HI>; not less than four times in two verses is it spoken.</Q>
See also <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.19. <HI>Thy dead shall live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y dead body, they shall arise:</HI> For so I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use to read the words, our version of them seemeth to me to darken the sence. There are variety of interpretations of the place, which I shall not trou∣ble you with. Some Jew∣ish <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

modern Divines, understand the words literally, and those that are not content with a literal inter∣pretation, yet do not doubt but in them there is an allusion to the resurrection of the last day, and so an argument fetched from the power of God to con∣firm the <HI>Iews</HI> in the belief of their salvation, inti∣mating, that if God be able to do such an incredible thing to flesh and bloud, as to raise the dead out of their graves, then he is able to accomplish such an incredible thing as <HI>Israel</HI>'s salvation. If we take the words to be spoken by the dead <HI>Iews,</HI> then the meaning of them may be this,
<Q>though I am (saith <HI>Israel</HI>) as dead men are, yet I shall live, yea though I am as a carkass or dead body, yet I shall rise.</Q>
Now the <HI>Iews</HI> are said to be in a state of death, and of the grave in two respects especially,
<Q>1. In respect of affliction and woful misery.</Q>
The deeps of afflicti∣on are like unto a grave, and misery is a kind of <HI>living death</HI>; For comfort is the life of a mans life, and therefore affliction destroying a mans comfort, is justly called by the name of death, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.16. <HI>Thou hast broken us in the place of Dragons, thou hast co∣vered us with the shadow of death,</HI> h. e. Thou <HI>hast brought sore</HI> and heavy calamity upon us, <HI>Isa.</HI> 56.10. <HI>we are as dead men in desolate places,</HI> i. e. we are in a very afflicted, miserable, forlorn estate. And also <HI>Psal.</HI> 88.4, 5, 6. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.6. And truly so may we say concerning the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation, it is an afflicted people, that indeed the very name of that Nation is called afflicted, <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.11. <HI>O thou afflicted, and
<PB N="84" REF="000143_0067_0FA2635D454931F8"/>
tossed with tempest, and not comforted:</HI> And it would pity a mans heart to read in some books, <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Harrisons Messiah</HI> al∣ready come in his Epistle to the <HI>Iews. Vide Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beck con∣tra Iud. Prolog.</HI> p. 20.</NOTE> what cruel and worse than <HI>Egyptian</HI> slavery the poor <HI>Iews</HI> are in at this day, in some parts of the world.
<Q>2. The <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation is said to be in a state of death, and of the grave in respect of sin.</Q>
For sin is the most deadly death, it is such a death as killeth an immortal soul, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.22. <HI>let the dead bury their dead,</HI> i. e. le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those that are spiritually dead, bury those that are corporally dead, let such as are dead in sin, go bury their dead relations, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.25. <HI>The hour now is that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,</HI> which (although it is true, that some which were corpo∣rally dead were not long after [that hour] Christ spake those words, quickned by the Son of God, yet it is true that the place) may be understood of a spi∣ritual sinful death, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1, 5. <HI>You hath he quickned who were dead</HI>: How dead? <HI>In respect of Trespasse: and sins,</HI> so <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13. Now thus may we say concern∣ing the <HI>Iews</HI> at this day, they remain in a state of sin, and therefore in a state of death: And how should it be otherwise, as long as they re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect him that <HI>is the way, the truth, and the life</HI>? To live, and yet to re∣ject him that is eternal life, is not possible. Well did the Lord Jesus say to them, <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.24. <HI>Except you believe that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</HI> Now the wretched <HI>Iews</HI> will not believe that Jesus Christ is he, that Jesus Christ is the true <HI>Messias,</HI> the Sa∣viour of the world, therefore they live, they die in sin: so then their salvation will be wonderful. For any one soul to be brought out of the grave of
<PB N="85" REF="000143_0067_0FA2635D454931F8"/>
sin, is wonderful, no less a wonder, than for a bo∣dy that hath been rotting in the belly of the earth to be brought out alive from thence: But what a mi∣racle then will it be when a whole Nation shall be brought out of a grave of sin? who can chuse but wonder at the thought of it?</P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. This salvation of <HI>Israel</HI> will be the more wonderful, inasmuch as the <HI>Iews</HI> have heretofore many a time &amp; often made fruitless and miserable attempts to deliver themselves out of their pre∣sent <HI>tribulation.</HI></Q>
Such hath been the dreadful, dire∣ful wrath of God against that stubborn and stiff neck∣ed people, that he hath left them often to be delud∣ed with vain hopes and attempts of salvation. And there are two ways especially, whereby the <HI>Iews</HI> have vainly sought to deliver themselves. 1.
<Q>By hearkning unto false Christs that have risen up a∣mongst them.</Q>
Thus the true <HI>Messias</HI> told the <HI>Iews</HI> that it would be, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.43. <HI>I am come in my fa∣thers name, and ye receive me not, if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive</HI>: As <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Profecto puto ob nullam aliam causam ecclesias in Gala∣tia, Corintho,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Per Pseu∣do-Apostolos sic turbatas esse, quam quod suos veros doctores neglexerint.</HI> Luther <HI>in Gal.</HI> 6.6.</NOTE> when God sendeth an able and faithful Ministry a∣mongst a people, but they are not duly en∣couraged, he will plague such a people by suffering false Teachers and Mi∣nisters of Satan to rise up amongst them. When a Ministry that hath light in it is not duly received, what will God then do? He will even remove the Lights into corners, and snuffs shall be set up in their rooms, so because the <HI>Iews</HI> received not the true <HI>Messias,</HI> therefore the vengeance of God gave
<PB N="86" REF="000143_0068_0FA2635F6B79F970"/>
them enough of false Christs: we read of two or three false <HI>Messias</HI> in the Scripture. In <HI>Acts</HI> 5.36. <HI>Before those days rose up</HI> Theudas <HI>boasting himself to be some-body, to whom a number of men, about</HI> 400, <HI>joyned themselves, who was slain, and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought:</HI> And there was <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioseph.

The conversion of souls, is the only stand∣ing miracle which remaineth in the Church of God; For it is beyond the power of nature to produce such a thing as soul-conversion: But what a mira∣cle then will the conversion of the <HI>Iews</HI> be? for a whole Nation to be converted, and that at once, a <HI>Nation born at once,</HI> and such a Nation as the <HI>Iews,</HI> who have ever been so opposite to God, and to Je∣sus Christ, and to the Gospel, and to the spirit of grace? how miraculous will this be? But besides this, I conceive and believe that the conversion of the <HI>Iews</HI> will not be brought to pass only by the or∣dinary means of preaching the Gospel, but by Vi∣sion, as <HI>Paul</HI>'s was, by a glorious manifestation of the person of the Son of God from heaven unto all the Tribes on the earth, causing them to mourn. There are many Scriptures and reasons which make me inclinable to such an apprehension, but intend∣ing to handle that subject by it self, I here desist; for I would not anticipate my self.</P>

<P><Q>We come now in the third place, to shew that <HI>this salvation of</HI> Israel <HI>will be</HI> a spiritual <HI>salvation.</HI></Q>
And the truth of that is evident,
<Q>1. Because the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be delivered out of the hands of spiritual evils and adversaries:</Q>
As now their blindess of mind and hardness of heart, is a spiritual evil; for the mind is a spirit. Hence the Apostle saith, <HI>be renewed in the spirit of your mind, Eph.</HI> 4.23. <HI>i. e.</HI> in the mind which is a spirit: now the <HI>Iews</HI> remaining in unbelief, are under the power of a blind and hardned mind, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7. <HI>The rest were blinded,</HI> and verse 25. <HI>blindness is hapned to Israel</HI>; or as the word may better be rendred, <HI>hardness is hap∣ned to Israel.</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>male vertitur,</HI> caecitas cordis, <HI>non quod ad sensum attinet, sed quoniam haec vox, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, non caecitatem proprie, sed ex consequente tantum significat, nam proprie duritiem significat.</HI> Cameron. <HI>in</HI> Matth. 19.3. <HI>Pro∣prie significat</HI> callosam concre∣tionem, <HI>instar tophi, ut in ar∣ticulo Podagricorum, quae in membro callo obducto non facile admittit tactum, &amp; sensum, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d duritie sua quasi repellit, &amp;c.</HI> Chemnit. <HI>Harm.</HI></NOTE> The Greek word noteth a brawny hardness, a de∣sperate obduration, such as maketh stupid and sensless: And they that have had to do with un∣believing <HI>Israelites,</HI> have seen the truth of this.

not, but as it is said, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.27. <HI>Because they know not the voices of the Prophets, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</HI> And why know they not the voices of the Prophets? that spake so clearly and abun∣dantly of Christs coming, both first and second, and time, and place, and manner, and of his two na∣tures and all, why do not the <HI>Iews</HI> understand this? surely it is because they are under the power of a blind mind and hard heart. See therefore 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.14, 15. <HI>their minds were blinded, for untill this day re∣maineth the same veil untaken away, in the reading of the old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ, but e∣ven unto this day, when</HI> Moses <HI>is read, the veil is upon their heart.</HI> Now what is this veil which the Apostle here speaketh of?

<Q>2. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere is <HI>an internal veil</HI> upon the minds and hearts of the <HI>Iews,</HI> that is to say, blindness and hardness which is upon them; they are under a strange and stupid error of conscience, whence they think, they do well to adhere unto the Mosaical dispensations, and to op∣pose Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and his Gospel;</Q>
And they are under
<PB N="93" REF="000143_0071_0FA26361642061F0"/>
perversness and obstinacy of will, whence they shut their eyes against the light, and grow blind against the Sun, that they neither do nor will believe, when conviction is held out before them, they will not come to Christ, that they might have light and life, he hath stretched forth his hands all the day long un∣to a gainsaying &amp; a rebellious people, he would have gathered them under his wings many a time and often, but they would not be gathered by him; This is a dark and dreadful veil upon the heart of that Nation, but <HI>they shall be saved</HI> from it, therefore verse 16. <HI>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</HI> In a word, all sin is a spiritual enemy, such an enemy as would destroy a mans spi∣rit, as would (that I may so speak) suck the bloud of a mans soul; therefore the Apostle exhorts to beware of sin, because <HI>it wars against the soul.</HI> Now the <HI>Iews</HI> remaining in unbelief, are under the power of this enemy, <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.34. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that commits sin, is a servant of sin</HI>: Certainly the <HI>Iews</HI> commit sin when they reject the counsel of God against themselves, when they go on contra∣dicting and blaspheming the Son of God, when they put away the word of life from them, therefore they are in woful servitude unto sin. But the day will come when they shall be freed from this bon∣dage, for they shall at last own and embrace the Lord Jesus Christ. In the latter days ('tis said) <HI>they shall seek the Lord, and</HI> David <HI>their King</HI>: And by that means they will be freed from sin, verse 36. <HI>If the Son make you free, then you shall be free indeed</HI>: Therefore when they shall once believe on the Son of God, they shall indeed be made free from sin, so 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the

spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</HI>; the Lord, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ who is the Lord even <HI>Ieho∣vah,</HI> (for the Lord in the New Testament doth of∣ten answer to <HI>Iehovah</HI> in the Old Testament) and who is a spirit, where he is embraced and believed on with all the heart, there is liberty from bondage of the Law, and liberty from the thraldom of sin. And the truth of this is also held forth in this very verse wherein my Text is. <HI>All Israel shall be saved</HI> (saith the Text)
<Q><HI>for a</HI> deliverer shall come out of <HI>Sion,</HI> and turn away ungodliness from <HI>Iacob.</HI></Q>
So that the house of <HI>Iacob,</HI> even all <HI>Israel,</HI> must be saved from ungodliness: And of this same thing there is a promise, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.29. <HI>I will save you from all your uncleannesses.</HI> And admirable to this purpose is that place, <HI>Ier.</HI> 50.19, 20.
<Q>I will bring again <HI>Israel</HI> to his habitation in those days; and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the sins of <HI>Iudah,</HI> but they shall not be found.</Q></P>
<P>Again <HI>Satan is a spiritual adversary,</HI> he is called by the name of <HI>an evil spirit,</HI> and the Devils are said to be spiritual wickednesses in high places, he thirst∣eth after the bloud of souls, he goeth up and down like a roaring Lyon, seeking to make a prey of the immortal spirits of men.

Besides it is evident that they are so, because they have long, and long ago, ceased from being the Church and people of God. Therefore <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.11. we read of <HI>their fall,</HI> that is to say, their falling from that relation which once they stood in to∣wards God, and of their <HI>casting away,</HI> verse 15. and

of their being <HI>broken off,</HI> verse 17. <HI>h. e.</HI> they are broken off from that Covenant and Church relation which once they stood in. This is true concerning the <HI>Israelites</HI> or ten Tribes, according to that, <HI>Hos.</HI> 1.9.
<Q>call his name <HI>Loammi,</HI> for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.</Q>

<Q>I took my staff Beauty and cut it asunder, that I might break my Covenant, which I had made with all the people, and it was broken in that day.</Q>
Now inasmuch as they cease to be a∣ny ways of the visible Church, therefore they are externally in the same capacity with the Pagan world, and therefore under Satans Regiment, be∣cause he is the <HI>Prince of the world, Iohn</HI> 16.11. why are excommunicate persons said to be <HI>delivered unto Satan,</HI> but because they are Authoritatively decla∣red to be no longer of the visible Church, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelaspy Aarons Rod.</HI> p. 297.</NOTE> but of the world, and therefore in the hands of Satan, who is the worlds God and Prince? Thus may we say concerning the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> God hath given her a Bill of divorce, God hath excom∣municated her for the present: But there is a day coming, when God will receive them into favour again, and then they shall be under the powers of darkness no longer, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.71.
<Q>they shall be sa∣ved from the hands of their enemies, and from the hand of all that hate them, which words al∣though they are comprehensive of temporal, yet they are not exclusive of spiritual enemies.</Q>
Besides, we read <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. That not long after the <HI>Iews</HI> con∣version an Angel cometh down from heaven (<HI>i. e.</HI>)
<PB N="97" REF="000143_0073_0FA26362F354D2C8"/>

<P N="2"><Q>2. The Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall not only be thus delivered from the hands of their sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritual ene∣mies, but they shall have spiritual life bestowed upon <HI>them.</HI></Q>
Indeed it is true, that first a civil life must enter into them, but after that a spiritual life. These two we have plainly distinguished <HI>one</HI> from the other, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.7, 8. <HI>the bones came together, bone to its bone, but there was no breath in them:</HI> Here is a civil life, for bone cometh to his bone, but no spi∣ritual life, for as yet there is no breath in them; even so, when the day of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation cometh, we must first expect to hear that the <HI>Iews</HI> are gathe∣ring together out of one Countrey, and out of ano∣ther Country, and making head toward their own Land, before we hear of their conversion, but after∣wards, it followeth therefore, verse 14. It is said, <HI>I will put my spirit in you, and you shall live.</HI> This spiri∣tual life is in regenerating grace, when the day of Gods power passeth over the soul to make it willing and obedient. Converting grace may well be called life, because it maketh them that were dead to be∣come alive, therefore it is said concerning the con∣verted prodigal, <HI>He was dead, but he is alive</HI>: Also because grace is the inchoation, the seed, the bud of eternal life and glory. <HI>Grace reigns to eternal life, Romans</HI> 5. last, <HI>holiness ends in everlasting life.</HI> chap. 6.22. Likewise grace is rightly called <HI>spiri∣tual life,</HI> because the Author of it is the blessed spirit of God, therefore all saving graces are said to be the <HI>fruits of the spirit.</HI> Gal. 5.22. And <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.5. It is said, <HI>except a man be born of water, and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, i. e.</HI> except he
<PB N="98" REF="000143_0074_0FA26363F7B162A0"/>
be regenerated by the spirit of God, whose opera∣tions are like unto water, to cleanse, and purge, and purifie the soul. Now, thus it true, that the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall have converting grace bestow∣ed upon them. The Lord hath promised <HI>to put his fear into their hearts,</HI> Jer. 32.40. And this is one thing intended in the Text, when it is said, <HI>that all</HI> Israel <HI>shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aved, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il.</HI> that there shall be a gene∣ral conversion of the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation. And it is true concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng all the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> therefore it is said, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.30. <HI>All the Tribes of the earth shall mourn</HI>; which, that it is (in part at least) meant of a penitential mourning, I doubt not. As when the children of <HI>Israel</HI> were brought out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> not on∣ly a civil, but a spiritual life was conferred upon them, according to that Scripture, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.6.
<Q><HI>When I</HI> passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy own blouds, I said unto thee in thy blouds, live; yea I said unto thee in <HI>thy blouds, live, h. e.</HI> when I saw thee under bloudy bondage by reason of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Task-masters, when there was a bloudy proclamation gone forth out of <HI>Pharoahs</HI> Court, that all thy Male children should be destroyed, then I looked upon thee, and caused a political life to en∣ter into thee, and when thou wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a filthy bloudy condition by reason of sin, corrupt nature and Ido∣latry which thou layest in whilst in <HI>Egypt,</HI> I bestow∣ed the grace of my Covenant upon thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
So it is in the like sort true, that when all <HI>Israel shall be sa∣ved,</HI> not only a life of liberty, but a life of grace shall enter into them.</P>
<P><Q>Yea 3ly. There shall be plentiful effusions of the spirit of God upon the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> when the day cometh that all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="000143_0074_0FA26363F7B162A0"/>And this will be in two respects; 1. In respect of gifts. 2. In respect of the saving grace of the spirit.</P>

There<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore he is said to be a spirit of judgment and of burning. Many there are both ancient and modern Divines, who think that after the <HI>Iews</HI> conversion, the Saints upon earth shall be brought into a sinless estate, that there shall be such a glorious renovation of all things here be∣low, that this world shall be as it was before sin entred into the word, and death by sin. What I conceive to be the truth of God concerning that matter, and needful for you to know, I shall (by the help of his grace) plainly declare unto you in these following Conclusions.</P>

The meaning of the place may be this, that although the childen of <HI>Israel</HI> for the present are in such a state of sin and enmity against God, that if their godly Ancestors should come and see them, they would be ashamed to own them for their chil∣dren; yet before the coming of the great day of judgment they shall be turned to serve the God whom their fathers served. It is true, that there was a partial and typical fulfilment of this Scripture in the Ministry of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> who was a blessed in∣strument of converting many of the children of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> before that great and notable day wherein the Jewish heaven and earth was utterly dissolved (which day may be looked upon as a Type of the last and great day) nevertheless, that there is yet a <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg">Read Mr. <HI>Medes</HI> Discourse on <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1.14, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>&amp; Alsted. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atrib. de Mille Annis.</HI> p. 213.214.</NOTE> greater accomplishment of this prophesie to be expected, we may plain∣ly discern from the words of our Saviour Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 17.11, 12. <HI>Iesus said, Elias</HI> shall <HI>first come and</HI> restore all things, <HI>but I say unto you,</HI> that Elias <HI>is come already</HI>: As if the Lord had said, although it be a truth that one in the spirit of <HI>Elias</HI> must come be∣fore the great day of judgment, yet it is true, that such an one is come already, and so that prophesie in part fulfilled in the Ministry of <HI>Iohn Baptist.</HI> But observe further, the Lord saith, that <HI>Elias</HI> shall come in the future Tense, which how can it be meant of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> who was beheaded when our

Moreover, the Lord saith, that <HI>Elias</HI> at his coming shall <HI>restore all things.</HI> Did <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> restore all things? was the first coming of Christ the <HI>time of the restitution of all things</HI>? the Scripture saith, that it is to be at the second coming of Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.21. wherefore it remains that there is yet another to come in the spi∣rit of <HI>Elias,</HI> who shall be a no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le instrument in the hand of Christ to prepare the <HI>Iews</HI> for the day of judgment. Again, see what the Scripture saith, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. <HI>Repent ye therefore and be converted to the blotting out of your sins, that so the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord</HI>: We have it tran∣slated, <HI>when the times of refreshing</HI> shall come.

This I believe is the true scope of the Apostle in those words. Moreover, it is conceived by some, that the reason why the Saints, whom Christ shall find alive at his coming, must be <HI>caught up to meet the Lord in the air,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.17. is, that so they might escape that conflagration whereby the wicked upon the earth shall be destroyed: As in the days of <HI>Noah</HI> when the world was destroyed by water, they that were not in the Ark perished: So when the day cometh that the world shall be destroyed by fire, (which fire <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg"><P>See King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. his Ca∣techism.</P>

Nevertheless, I do not think hat it is any Heresie to believe (though I am not of that perswasion) that <HI>the rapture of the Saints into the air</HI> to meet Christ will not be at his next coming to de∣stroy Antichrist, and to set up his glorious kingdom upon earth (which coming of Christ some great Divines look upon rather as a personal appearance, than a personal residence upon earth) but that this <HI>rapture</HI> will be at Christs coming to destroy <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> at the ultimate judgment, when the Lord will be for a long time resident in this lower world. By all this then it is apparent that before Jesus Christ cometh to judge the world, the <HI>Iews</HI> shall be converted.</P>

Albeit 'tis true that there shall be an eminency of gifts and grace among them, yet it is a vain thing to dream of a state of perfection upon earth before the last day. Hence we read of <HI>steps</HI> or stairs in <HI>Ezekiels Temple, Ezek.</HI> 40.22, 26, 31, 34, 37. What is the meaning of that? but, that after <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Temple shall be begun, there will be a gradual going on towards perfection, they shall go from step to step, appearing before God in <HI>Sion,</HI> they shall go on from one degree of grace to another. Therefore there will not be an absolute freedom from sin. Besides the thing is marvellous clear if we duly consider what is said, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31.29, 30. <HI>In those days, (i. e.</HI> in those days when all the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved) <HI>they shall say no more, the fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the childrens teeth are set an edge, but every one shall die for his own iniquity, every man that eateth a sour grape, his teeth shall be set an edge.</HI> The meaning of the place may be this. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Zanch. de peccat.

It is in∣deed true, that before the Resurrection of Christ divers were raised from a state of death unto life, who yet were afterwards subject unto sin. Thus may we say concerning that Widows Son which was raised from death in the days of <HI>Elijah</HI>; the <HI>Iews</HI> have a tradition, that that Widows Son was
<PB N="108" REF="000143_0079_0FA26367654AE3E8"/>
the Prophet <HI>Ionah,</HI> if so, to be sure he had more than a little of sin and corrupt nature in him after his Resurrection. Thus also may we conceive of <HI>Lazarus</HI> and others mentioned in the Scripture, as rising from the dead before our Saviours Resur∣rection. And that they were subject unto sin, is e∣vident, because they dyed again; And that is pro∣ved, because Jesus Christ was <HI>the first born from the dead,</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Ieanes</HI> on <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18.</NOTE> <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.23. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.5. Now, why is Christ said to be the first born from the dead? Is it not, because he is the first that had a Resurrection, even a Resurrection to a state of im∣mortality? Though there were others that rose from the dead before Christ, yet their Resurrection was not perfect, for they dyed again, stand in need of another Resurrection unto immortality, there∣fore <HI>Christ is the first born from the dead.</HI> But at the last day, all the Saints shall be raised unto a sinless immortal state. And this is manifest, because <HI>the last enemy which shall be destroyed is death,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.26. But if the Saints after their Resurrection should be subject unto sin, there would be another enemy far worse than death, <HI>scil.</HI> sin to be destroyed after the abolition of death, which is expresly contrary to what the holy Apostle faith.</P>
<P>And hence we read concerning <HI>the new Ierusalem, which cometh down from God out of heaven</HI> (which new <HI>Ierusalem</HI> I take to be the very same with the first Resurrection spoken of, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.) that there is in it <HI>nothing that defileth,</HI> nor any besides such <HI>whose names are written in the Lambs book of life,</HI> Revel. 21.27.</P>

I say I doubt not to affirm to you, that there will be such a day, when the Saints upon earth shall do the will of God with as much perfection as it is now done by the Angels of heaven. But stay a while, look not for that day till <HI>the Resurrection of the just,</HI> and then you shall see it. So that it is a great &amp; a precious truth, that there will be a day when the Saints of God shall even up∣on earth be for a long time in a sinless glorious e∣state. For the day of judgment will be upon earth; For where should men be judged, but in the place where they have lived, either to the honour or to the dishonour of the great God and Judge of all the earth? Therefore <HI>Iob</HI> speaks, as you find chap. 19. verse 25.26. <HI>I know</HI> (saith he) <HI>that my Redeemer li∣veth, and that he shall stand at the latter day, (i. e.</HI> the day of Judgment) upon the earth, <HI>and that in my flesh I shall see God,</HI> so <HI>Zech.</HI> 14.4. It is said, <HI>his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.</HI> And as it is true, that <HI>the judgment</HI> will be upon the earth, so likewise it shall be <HI>a day of long continuance.</HI> Can a world of men, even all that have been alive from <HI>Adam,</HI> to the last man that ever shall be born

into the world; I say, can all those millions of milli∣ons of men and women that have been, are, or ever shall be upon the earth, be called to a particular ac∣count for all the words, thoughts, and actions of their lives? can the secrets of all hearts be disclosed in the hearing of heaven and earth in a little space of time? No verily, but the preparation for <HI>eternal judgment</HI> will take up more time than a few weeks, or moneths, or ages. I do believe, that <HI>a thousand years</HI> will be but a part, <HI>a morning</HI> as it were, <HI>of that great and last day,</HI> after which all things must be swallowed up in the amazing gulf of an endless eter∣nity.</P>
<P>Moreover, we may argue thus. <HI>The world to come</HI> will be of long continuance. Consider <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.22. Hence this world to come is called, an everlasting kingdom. Jesus Christ is the Prince and Father of the world to come, and he is an <HI>everlasting father,</HI> Isa 9.6.

<P N="3">"3. There will be spiritual ordinances.

<P><Q>First the thing is evident, inasmuch as the day will come when the children of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be no more oppressed by the great ones of the earth;</Q>
<PB N="118" REF="000143_0084_0FA2636B6320DBE0"/>
There will be a time when <HI>the man of the earth shall no more oppress, Psal.</HI> 10.18. Hence <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear, and from terrour, for it shall not come near thee.</HI> Hence <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> said unto the <HI>Iews,</HI> that after their repentance, <HI>times of refreshing shall come, Acts</HI> 3.19.

<Q>So <HI>Isa.</HI> 14.2, 3. They shall take them captives, whose cap∣tives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give them rest from their sorrows, and from their fears, and from the hard bondage wherein they were made to serve.</Q>
See also Chap. 60. verse 14. with <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39.10.</P>
<P>Nor shall any amongst themselves oppress their poor brethren. Indeed it hath been so formerly, which caused the Apostle to use that interrogation, <HI>do not rich men oppress you? Iam.</HI> 2.6. But after this day of salvation which we are speaking of, it shall be so no more; <HI>Ezek.</HI> 46.18.
<Q>The Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression.</Q>
<HI>Isa.</HI> 60.17. <HI>I will make thy officers peace, and thy ex∣actors righteousness.</HI> For it is observable, that the children of <HI>Israel</HI> were not subject unto oppression from their own Rulers, until such time as they cast off that <HI>Theocraty,</HI> or Government by Judges which was of divine appointment. See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.3.

<P><Q>Yea 2ly. There w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a time come when the <HI>Is∣rael</HI> of God shall be saved from all outward af∣flictions:</Q>

shall come,</HI> but of what shall be upon earth sometime before Jesus Christ hath delivered up his Mediato∣ry kingdom. Now I say there will a time come when upon earth <HI>the Israel of God</HI> shall be wholly freed from affliction, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.15. <HI>Thou shalt not see e∣vil any more, Isa.</HI> 61.
<Q><HI>Beg.</HI> liberty shall be pro∣claimed to the captives, the opening of the pri∣son to them that are bound, and to them that mourn in <HI>Sion</HI> shall be given beauty for ashes, joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spi∣rit of heaviness.</Q>
So that after the time cometh that the <HI>Iews</HI> shall mourn, that they shall look up∣on him whom they have pierced and mourn bitter∣ly, they shall no more lie in the ashes of affliction and outward calamity. See Chap. 51.11. <HI>sorrow and mourning shall flee away</HI>: Affliction shall vanish. And hence it is said of the new <HI>Ierusalem, Rev.</HI> 21.4.
<Q>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain, for the former things are passed away.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3ly, The truth is further evident, in that there will a day come, when the <HI>Israel</HI> of God shall en∣joy length of dayes as to natural or corporal life.</Q></P>
<P>As if <HI>Adam</HI> had never sinned, he had enjoyed a natural life upon earth for a long time. And in∣deed it was especially a natural life, which the Co∣venant of works promised. When it was said to <HI>Adam, Do and live,</HI> the meaning was, Thou shalt then live a long and happy life upon earth: even so when God shall make all things new, the Saints shall be wonderfully delivered from natural, as well as spiritual death.

when new <HI>Ierusalem</HI> cometh down from heaven, <HI>there shall be no more death.</HI> And of this we have a promise made to <HI>Israel, Hos.</HI> 13.14.

<P>It is also true, that these truths have been very much obscured, they have been little searched into, little known, little believed in the world. It may be some of you think that they are new and strange notions: But if you think them new, I can assure
<PB N="126" REF="000143_0088_0FA26385614954F0"/>
you upon diligent search, that these things passed for currant Doctrine in the Church of God for di∣vers hundred of years in the Primitive and purest days of the Christian Church. Yea they were never called into question until the third or fourth Cen∣tury, when Antichrist began to rise. And then in∣deed it was high time that those truths, which do so much concern the glory of <HI>the kingdom of the Messias,</HI> should be opposed and obscured, when the great enemy of Christ began to get head in the world. And ever since, albeit some of the Lords Worthies have born witness unto these very truths, yet they have been exceedingly darkned; partly by those that have gone beyond what is written in the word, and partly by those that have set themselves to oppose what the word saith. Nevertheless, if these be (as I am perswaded verily they are) <HI>the faithful and true sayings of God</HI>; it will be our great sin, if we should neglect to search into them: But how sinful a thing then must it needs be to oppose and contemn these Mysteries of God?</P>

<P><Q><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. Doth not Christ say that the kingdom of God cometh not with observation, <HI>Luke</HI> 17.20. How then is it true, that Christ shall have such a glorious kingdom upon earth as we have heard?</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The meaning of our Saviour in that place may be, that his first coming should not be according to the <HI>Pha∣risees</HI> expectation:</Q>
<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fieri potest ut aliud sit <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> quam vulgo existimatur.

of God, and the king∣dom of heaven, because it is that kingdom which <HI>Daniel</HI> prophesied <HI>the God of heaven should set up,</HI> was not to begin as the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and other <HI>Iews</HI> thought it would. You (saith Christ to the <HI>Phari∣sees</HI>) make account that as soon as <HI>Messias</HI> cometh, he will deliver you out of the hands of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and become a great earthly Monarch; but you are much mistaken, therefore it is added, <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>The kingdom of God is amongst you,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Messias</HI> is now amongst you; for I do not take the meaning of those words to be, that Christ's kingdom is <HI>regnum ani∣marum</HI> in the souls and consciences of men, though that be a great truth, <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Bezam, Heinsium, Iunium, Tremelium, &amp; Pisca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>em in loc.</HI></NOTE> yet though there be <HI>veri∣tas rei</HI> in that exposition, there is not <HI>veritas loci,</HI> but Christ would give them to understand, that <HI>Messias</HI> was already come and conversing amongst them.</P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>We must distinguish between the first and se∣cond coming of Christ.</Q>
The <HI>Pharisees</HI> were wil∣lingly ignorant of this necessary distinction; nor do the <HI>Iews,</HI> even to this day, believe, that there is any such distinction to be made of <HI>Messias</HI>'s coming▪ Nay their <HI>Rabbies</HI> do expresly teach the contrary, <HI>sc.</HI> that there shall be <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg">Menassch. Ben Israel <HI>de Resurrect.</HI> l. 3. c. 3.</NOTE> but one coming of the <HI>Messias.</HI> And because the Scriptures of the old Testament are clear for two comings of Christ, therefore the <HI>Iews</HI> have embraced an heretical ficti∣on
<PB N="130" REF="000143_0090_0FA26386DE4121E8"/>
that there shall be <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem in spe</HI> Israelis p. 78. <HI>&amp; Rabbini in Talmud passim.

<P>Now then by applying this distinction, the an∣swer to the objection is clear &amp; easie, <HI>viz.</HI> that the first coming of Christ should not at all be according to the <HI>Iews</HI> expectati∣on in respect of visible glory, but at the first he was to come in the form of a Servant, as an abject a∣mongst men, and to be abhorred of his own Nation according to the savings of the Prophets; but the second coming of Christ shall be <HI>in as great visible</HI> (and yet spiritual) <HI>glory</HI> as ever the <HI>Iews</HI> expected that the coming of <HI>Messias</HI> would be, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.30.
<Q><HI>They shal</HI> see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and Chap. 25.31. The Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; then shall he sit upon the Throne of his glory.</Q>
And hence it is ob∣servable, that Christ did never absolutely deny his having such <HI>a visible glorious kingdom upon earth,</HI> as that which his Disciples then looked for, only he cor∣rected their errour as to the time of this kingdoms appearing. The Disciples said,
<Q><HI>Lord</HI> wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to <HI>Israel?</HI></Q>
<HI>Acts</HI> 1.6. Christ did not say to them, that there should never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any such restauration of the kingdom to <HI>Israel,</HI> as their thoughts were running upon, only telleth them that the times and seasons were not for them to know, thereby acknowledging that such a
<PB N="131" REF="000143_0090_0FA26386DE4121E8"/>
kingdom should indeed be as they (for the substance of it) did from the holy Prophets expect; Thus, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.11.
<Q>There were some that thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.</Q>
Now therein was their errour; not in expecting a glorious appearance <HI>of the kingdom of God,</HI> but in that they made account this would be <HI>immediately.</HI> Whereupon our Saviour, to correct that errour as to the time of his <HI>kingdoms coming,</HI> speaketh a Parable of a certain noble man that went into a far Country to receive for himself a kingdom, and so to return. What is this far Country, but heaven? when Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, then he began his glo∣rious kingdom: Hence our Saviour said, <HI>Mark</HI> 9.1.
<Q>there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste death till they have seen the king∣dom of God come with power.</Q>
What is the meaning of that? The <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic Theophylact, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thymi∣us, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Ancients are wont to expound it of the trans∣figuration of Christ which followed a few days after those words were spoken; and indeed in that transfiguration the words of Christ were typically fulfilled: But I take the spe∣cial design of Christ to be, an intimation to his Disciples of his <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Beza in</HI> Matth. 16. ult.</NOTE> as∣cension. Some of you saith Christ shall see me ascend into the heaven of heavens, there to sit reigning till my enemies be made my foot-stool.

<PB N="132" REF="000143_0091_0FA263879B02D350"/>
a most glorious kingdom, at his ascensio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into hea∣ven, therefore <HI>at his return from heaven the glory of the kingdom of God will appear.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>Obj.</HI> 3. Doth not Christ say, my kingdom is not of this world, <HI>Iohn</HI> 18.36. how then is it true that Christ shall have such a glorious king∣dom upon earth as that which hath been spoken of?</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. That may be in this world which is not of the world, so <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.14. they are not of the world, even as I am not <HI>of the world.</HI></Q>
And yet both Christ and they were then in the world.
<Q>2. The kingdom of Christ may be said not to be of this world, because it is not of a carnal earthly, but of an high and heavenly nature. It is an <HI>heaven∣ly kingdom,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.18.</Q>
The very kind and na∣ture of it is so. This bringeth to mind a <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. Hist. Eccles.</HI> l. 3. c. 15. <HI>Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Lat.</HI></NOTE> remarkable story which <HI>Eusebius</HI> relateth to have fallen out in the days of the <HI>Emperour Domitian,</HI> it is this.
<Q>There were (saith he) some malicious <HI>Iews,</HI> who out of envy at the truth informed the Empe∣rour, that such and such persons were, as concern∣ing the flesh, near akin unto Christ; whereupon the Emperour sent for those persons, intending to have killed them; but when he heard them say, that the kingdom of Christ was not of a terrene, but only of a celestial nature, he dismissed them without doing them any hurt.</Q>
And hence it is, that the kingdom of Christ is not carryed on by earthly and carnal, but by spiritual weapons, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4. <HI>our weapons are not carnal.</HI> The kingdoms of this world how are they got? and how are they
<PB N="133" REF="000143_0091_0FA263879B02D350"/>
kept? Is it not by fire, and bloud, and sword? but so it is not with the kingdom of Christ, he subdu∣eth the world, by the power of his word and spirit, that's the bow whereby he conquereth the Nations before him, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.2. And this interpretation suiteth exactly with the scope of our Saviour in the place alledged, therefore he saith, <HI>his servants do not fight</HI>; It is therefore a woful mistake in those men, who say, <HI>that the Saints, as such,</HI> must take up arms and destroy the ungodly of the world before them, and when they have done so, they will invite Christ to come from heaven and reign over them. Nay verily, but the weapons of Saints as such are not swords and spears, but <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Preces &amp; lacrymae sunt arma Ecclesiae.</HI> Ambrose.</NOTE> <HI>prayers and tears.</HI> 3.
<Q>I answer, <HI>That though</HI> the kingdom of Christ be not of <HI>this world,</HI> yet it is of the world to come.</Q>
Christ doth not say my kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not of any world, only it's not of <HI>this world.</HI> And indeed that glorious kingdom promised unto Christ and his Saints upon the earth, is not to be ex∣pected in this world, but in the <HI>world to come,</HI> i. e. at <HI>the day of judgment.</HI> Sometimes indeed the world to come is taken more comprehensively, for <HI>Dies Messiae,</HI> the whole time of the <HI>Messias</HI>; therefore the Apostle saith, that upon <HI>them the ends of the world were come,</HI> and that Apostates <HI>may taste of the powers of the wold to come,</HI> yet more than once in the Scrip∣ture is the world to come taken more strictly for <HI>Dies judicii, vel secundi adventus Messiae,</HI> the day of judgment as we shewed you the last opportunity. Consider <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.20, 21. <HI>Luke</HI> 20.34, 35, 36. Then, and not till then, will be the time when the Saints
<PB N="134" REF="000143_0092_0FA2638BADC3F528"/>
shall judge the world, and have dominion over all the earth. There are many mistakes about this mat∣ter. Some deny that ever the Saints shall have a glorious kingdom upon the earth; others say, that it shall be, but long before Jesus Christ cometh to judge the world. But the truth is, that great glory promised to the Saints, the new heaven and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, will be neither before, nor after, but during the time of the day of judgment. Then shall every knee bow, and every tongue confess unto God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.10, 11. Thus <HI>Psal.</HI> 66.4. it is said,

So that when the time cometh that the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
<PB N="137" REF="000143_0093_0FA2638E04B4AE70"/>
heaven shall be given to the Saints, the judgment shall sit. Now, that by the judgment fitting is meant, <HI>the great day of judgment,</HI> is to me past a doubt. For whence is that term of <HI>the day of judg∣ment</HI>? we do not find it in the old Testament, but often in the new. And the reason why Christ and his Apostles used that term, was, because it was much used in the Church of the <HI>Iews,</HI> and had a Scripture foundation. Hence we read of the day of judgment more frequently in the <HI>Iews</HI> writings then in the new Testament it self. Now the <HI>Iews</HI> took up that term, <HI>of the day of judgment,</HI> from the 7th. Chap. of <HI>Dan.</HI> Therefore no doubt but that by the <HI>judgment sitting,</HI> is meant the <HI>great day of judgment</HI>; therefore till <HI>that day</HI> the kingdom un∣der the whole heaven cometh not into the hands of the Saints. Again, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. The times of re∣freshing
<Q>are said to be from the presence of the Lord.</Q>
Therefore Jesus Christ will be personally present (and that he will not be till the judgment) when the times of refreshing shall come. And in the Scripture <HI>the day of judgment</HI> is described by <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hinc in Epist.

And in <HI>vers.</HI> 21. It is plainly expressed, that in the glorious time of the restitution of all things, Jesus will come again from heaven. And is not 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.7. a clear place to prove, that the glorious <HI>Sabbatism</HI> which remains for the Saints upon earth will begin at Christs coming from heaven to judge the world? Hence also Christs kingdom is said to be at the time of his appearing to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.1. And <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.15.
<Q>the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever <HI>and ever.</HI></Q>
So that when the time cometh that all the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, the seventh Angel sounds the Trumpet. Now by the seventh Trumpet (as <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic Andraas, Aretas, Beda, Primasius, Foxus, Bullingerus, Tossanus, Marloratus, Alphon∣sus, Pareus, Medus, Piscator, &amp; alii.</HI></NOTE> Interpreters do very unanimously carry it) we are to understand the last Trump, which shall usher in the resur∣rection of the dead, and the day of judgment, wherefore <HI>vers.</HI> 18. 'tis said, <HI>thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants,</HI>
<Q>the Pro∣phets, and to thy Saints, and them that fear thy name small and great, and shouldst destroy them
<PB N="139" REF="000143_0094_0FA2638E63071A20"/>
which destroy the earth.</Q>
By all these Scriptures then it is abundantly evident, That the glorious kingdom which Christ with his Saints shall have upon earth, will not be till the great day of judg∣ment. Only remember that the Scripture speaks of a first and a second resurrection, and so of a first and an ultimate judgment. For as in a day there is an evening and a morning, so in this great day, even the day of judgment, there is an evening and a morning: The one containeth that blessed thousand years <HI>Iohn</HI> speaketh of, the other containeth that space which shall be between the resurrection of the unjust, and the time when Christ shall give up his Mediatory kingdom, when God shall be all in all.</P>
<P><Q>Youl say, but this is cold comfort for us, we expected a glorious time for the Saints upon earth to be at hand, but you tell us that that great glory promised to the Saints upon earth, when new <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI> cometh down from heaven, is not to be expected before the day of judgment.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Truly I do tell you so, yet I trust not I, but the Lord; Nevertheless as for such of you as do indeed love and long for the appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ: I shall say two things to you which are full of admirable consolati∣on. 1.
<Q>That the day of judgment is not so far off as the world imagines it is.</Q></P>

judgment</HI> is signifyed by that expression of <HI>the Lords coming.</HI> Furthermore, in the 9th.

<Q>It is said the Lord hath prepared his Throne for judgment, and he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judg∣ment to the people in <HI>uprightness.</HI></Q>
So that when <HI>Muth-labben,</HI> when the death of the son of perdition shall come, the Lord will sit upon his Throne judg∣ing the world. But the final ruine of Antichrist cannot be far off. It is certain that the time, times, and half a time allowed for Antichrists reign is very far spent; therefore the day of judgment draws on apace. Now what a most comfortable meditation is this? <HI>Amen, even so, come Lord Iesus, come quick∣ly!</HI></P>

For the <HI>Iews</HI> (as hath been shewed) shall be con∣verted before the day of judgment. And <HI>Rome</HI> (though not the whole Antichristian state) will be destroyed before the coming of Christ; and the resurrection of the two witnesses will take place before the sounding of the 7th. even towards the conclusion of the 6th. Trumpet. Consider <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.11, 12. So that there must be <HI>an heaven</HI> established in the world which shall put great respect upon the slain and silenced witnesses of Jesus Christ, <HI>h. e.</HI> God will shake the <HI>European</HI> Nations (this once more he will shake not the earth only, but the hea∣ven)
<PB N="144" REF="000143_0097_0FA26390A75876C8"/>
until he hath brought forth such higher powers as shall promote the interest of Jesus Christ and his Saints. That I take to be meant by <HI>heaven,</HI> even <HI>an higher power.</HI> For so the Prophetical strain runs. Hence the ruine of the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> is described by saying, <HI>how art thou fallen from</HI> heaven <HI>O Lucifer</HI>▪ and the destruction of the state of <HI>Idumea</HI> is set forth by saying, <HI>the Lord will hath his sword in heaven,</HI> the overthrow of the <HI>Roman</HI> Pagan higher powers is called <HI>a departure of the heavens as a scroll:</HI> And hence it is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.8. The Dragon <HI>found no more place in heaven, i. e.</HI> Pagans were no more suffered to be in any place of Authority, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus when it is said, that the witnesses must hear a great voice <HI>from heaven,</HI> it argueth that an higher power shall be established in the world, which will highly advance and honour the faithful witnesses of Jesus Christ. Now by comparing the word and works of God to∣gether. I cannot but be perswaded, that the Lord is even now about to bring this great work to pass, though <HI>in such a way as shall astonish all the earth.</HI> It may be in such a way, and by such means as that you read of <HI>Iudg.</HI> 7.22. And 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.23. How∣ever sure it is, that when the witnesses are raised, 'tis by <HI>a spirit of life from God, h. e.</HI> the thing will be effected by the mighty wonder-working hand of Divine Providence. Likewise this work must be brought to pass suddenly and unexpectedly, which may possibly be intended when it is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.12. The witnesses <HI>ascended in a cloud, h. e.</HI> not only with the acclamations of a multitude, as thick as clouds, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.8. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. but suddenly and unexpect∣edly. For the clouds fly swiftly, and when the hea∣ven is clear many times, speedily and unexpectedly
<PB N="145" REF="000143_0097_0FA26390A75876C8"/>
it is over-spread with clouds. Therefore in the Prophetical strain, a sudden and strange event is signifyed by the notion of <HI>a cloud.</HI> Consider <HI>Ier.</HI> 4.13. &amp; <HI>Isa.</HI> 19.1.</P>
<P>Thus have we done with the <HI>Doctrinal part</HI> of this great Truth, concerning <HI>Israels salvation.</HI> We pro∣ceed now (as the Lord shall help) to <HI>infer</HI> some <HI>Uses</HI> from the Doctrine delivered.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Use</HI> 1. Is it so that <HI>the time will surely come</HI> when all <HI>Israel</HI> shall partake of such a salvation as that which hath been spoken of? Hence then it fol∣loweth, that we should labour to be acquainted with these Truths which do concern the Mystery of God in <HI>Israels</HI> salvation.</Q>
Indeed if these things were cunningly devised fables, or if they were but the uncertain conjectures of men, we might be held excused, though we should not be∣stow precious time in looking into them; but in∣asmuch as they are things <HI>that shall surely come to pass,</HI> the evil will be great if we should not look into these holy Mysteries. We may say of these things, as the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> spake concerning that dream which God sent upon <HI>Nebuchadnezar,</HI> Dan. 2.45.
<Q><HI>the dream</HI> is certain, and the interpretation there∣of is sure.</Q>
Now part of that dream was concern∣ing the kingdom of Jesus Christ, first, as a little stone, by the power of his word and spirit, sub∣duing the world; and after that as a great mountain filling the whole earth. So that there will a time come when the kingdom of Christ shall be esta∣blished all the earth over, <HI>the thing is certain and sure.</HI> And therefore <HI>Iohn</HI> (or Christ by <HI>Iohn</HI>) speak∣ing concerning that new heaven, and new earth
<PB N="146" REF="000143_0098_0FA263922FEB6CF0"/>
which shall be when part of heaven shall come down upon the earth, <HI>sc.</HI> when new <HI>Ierusalem</HI> shall come down from God out of heaven, saith, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6. <HI>These sayings are faithful and true,</HI> h. e. they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such things as God will faithfully and truly perform, that nothing shall be unfulfilled of all those sayings which the mouth of the Lord hath spoken. There∣fore these are sayings not to be neglected.</P>
<P>Now in the prosecution of this <HI>Use,</HI> two things may be attended. 1. To lay down some Motives to stir us up to search into these mysterious things. 2. Some Rules of direction to be observed, in or∣der to attaining the knowledge thereof.</P>
<P><Q>For Motives consider 1. The divine excel∣lency which is in these mysterious truths.</Q>
Indeed all truth is of a divine original. God is the Author of all truth, because he is the Author of all being, and truth and being are the same: As all goodness is originally from the goodness of God, so all truth is originally from the truth of God: Hence God is called, <HI>the God of truth,</HI> and his spirit, <HI>the spirit of truth</HI>; because <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Veritas a quocun{que} est, a spiritu sancto est.</HI> Ambros. <HI>Prophetae Daemonum si vera lo∣quantur, ista veritas est a spiri∣tu sancto. Vide</HI> Raimund. Bre∣gan. <HI>de Theol. Gent.</HI> c. 12.</NOTE> all truth is from God, and from his spirit. But e∣specially this is true concerning those truths that cannot be known by the book of the <HI>creature,</HI> but only by the book of <HI>Scripture:</HI> and most of all is this true concerning <HI>Prophetical Scripture.</HI> All Scri∣pture is given by inspiration of God; but this is eminently to be affirmed of the prophesies con∣tained in the Scriptures of truth, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20, 21. Hence the prophetical book of the new Testament
<PB N="147" REF="000143_0098_0FA263922FEB6CF0"/>
is called by the name of <HI>Revelation,</HI> Rev. 1.1. <HI>The revelation of Iesus Christ</HI>; why Revelation? but be∣cause the things contained in that book, had never been known amongst the sons of men, had it not been for the extraordinary Revelation of the spirit of Christ. As <HI>the Gospel</HI> is said to be <HI>by revelation, Gal.</HI> 1.12. because the mysteries of the Gospel are not learned out of the book of Nature. So the pro∣phesies of God's word are called <HI>Revelation,</HI> because the things therein contained had never been known unto the world, but by and from the <HI>Revelation</HI> of the spirit.</P>
<P>Besides, it is evident, that there is some peculiar excellency in these mysteries which concerns the glory of Christs kingdom upon earth, because it hath been the great design of Satan to obscure, and darken, and hide these truths from the world. From the great subtilty of Satan it hath come to pass that some men of very corrupt minds have asserted that <HI>Messias</HI> shall have a glorious kingdom upon the earth, Some <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">So say <HI>Eusebius</HI> and <HI>Au∣stin.</HI> But it may be questioned whether <HI>Cerinthus</HI> did indeed hold any such opinion, for neither <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> nor <HI>Tertulli∣an,</HI> nor yet <HI>Epiphanius</HI> do mention any such thing to be amongst the Errours of <HI>Ce∣rinthus.</HI></NOTE> say that <HI>Cerinthus</HI> (adding to this opinion carnal and he∣retical delusions) did so maintain; to be sure he was a very desperate Heretick, and may be one of those Antichrists which the Apostle speak∣eth of when he saith, that many Antichrists were then come, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2.18. Likewise the <HI>Iews</HI> in their <HI>Talmud</HI> have many gross and carnal conceits about the temporal glory of <HI>Messias</HI> his kingdom. So

have many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat are of the fifth-Monarchy perswasion.

Now by this means Sa∣tan hath greatly prevail∣ed to keep the world in ignorance of the true glory of these mysteries; for many good men are apt to think with themselves, what? shall we be∣lieve that the Saints shall have a glorious reign up∣on earth? that's an opinion which Hereticks have held, which savours of <HI>Iudaism,</HI> which such and such disorderly persons have been taken with, and so Sa∣tan hath his design in keeping many godly souls from enjoying the comfort of these truths. This then sheweth, that there is some divine excellency in these mysteries, otherwise the wicked one would not so envy Gods children the knowledge of these things. Again, it is evident, that there is an ex∣cellency in these truths, because of the difficulty which is in coming to the clear understanding of them.</P>
<P>It is an usual observa∣tion, that <NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Arist.</HI></NOTE> <HI>precious things are attained with

much difficulty</HI>; so may we say concerning truths▪ as well as things, precious truths are found out with much difficulty. The sweetest kernel is many times hid under the hardest shell: even so before a man come to the kernel of these truths, there's an hard shell to be broken which will cost some pains and difficulty. I say there is difficulty and obscurity in these truths. Hence, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16. <HI>In which</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>are some things hard to be understood.</HI> The <HI>Antecedent</HI> to that <HI>relative</HI> [which] is not Epistles, but things (for <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lectionem amplector quam pieri{que} codices sequuntur ut <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> non <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> legatur.</HI> Heinsius.

Our belo∣ved Brother <HI>Paul,</HI> saith <HI>Peter,</HI> hath spoken not only in his Epistle unto <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Viz. Hebr.</HI> 1.6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2.5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 12.14, 28, 29.</NOTE> you <HI>Hebrews,</HI> but in all the rest of his Epistles concerning the coming of Christ to judge the world, and to set up his glo∣gious kingdom upon the earth, <HI>in which things there are some matters hard to be understood.</HI> Moreover, this is wont to be noted as one difference between truths fundamental and extra-fundamental. In that, as for fundamental truths, the knowledge of them is easily attained▪ As he <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hilary.</HI></NOTE> said of old, <HI>In per∣spicuo &amp; facili stat aeterni∣tas.</HI> Truths absolutely necessary to salvation are clear and easie to be discerned: whereas extra-fun∣damental
<PB N="150" REF="000143_0100_0FA263939CE483D0"/>
truths are many times involved in great diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culties and obscurities. And of this sort are the truths which concern that glorious visible kingdom which Jesus Christ shall one day possess upon the earth. Let no one say, then we will not labour after the knowledge of these truths, if they are of a cir∣cumstantial nature only: By the same reason you may say that you will not labour to be acquainted with the order which God hath appointed for the Government of his Church which is his house, be∣cause the knowledge of those things is extra-funda∣mental; yet surely we should labour to be ac∣quainted not only with matters of faith, but of order; not only with matters of Doctrine, but with matters of Worship and Discipline: But inasmuch as these truths concerning Christs kingdom are ex∣tra-fundamental, therefore the knowledge of them is difficult▪ And inasmuch as the knowledge of them is difficult, therefore the truths are excel∣lent.</P>
<P>Furthermore it is evident, that there is a pecu∣liar excellency in these truths, because the right knowledge of them maketh one blessed. See <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Blessed is he that readeth, i. e.</HI> he that rightly in∣terpeteth: we call the interpretation of a Riddle the reading of it, so the interpretation of prophe∣sies (which are Riddles before their accomplish∣ment) is the reading of them, <HI>and they that hear the words of this prophesie, h. e.</HI> they that hear one rightly interpreting the words of that prophesie. Now where can you find amongst all the books of God, the like solemn encouragement to the reading and study thereof? what other boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is there in all the Bible that begins so, <HI>Blessed is he that understandeth
<PB N="151" REF="000143_0100_0FA263939CE483D0"/>
this book?</HI> Therefore undoubtedly there is a divine and glorious excellency more than ordinary in the truths contained in that Book which is a more full declaration of the Mystery of God revealed unto the holy Prophets.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Consid.</HI> 2. It is no small evil to be willingly ig∣norant of these divine and holy mysteries.</Q>
Indeed when men are ignorant through weakness or inabi∣lity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odiscern the truth, God will many times pass by such weakness as that is: But if ignorance be either through prejudice conceived against the truth, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through a spirit of sloth and negligence whence a man will not take pains to come unto the know∣ledge of the truth, it is a very provoking sin.
<Q>What saith the Apostle? 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. we have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure word of prophesie, whereunto you do well that you take heed:</Q>
But what then shall we think of those who as to the word of prophesie they give no heed unto it? certainly they do not do well, but they do very ill. Some there are that as to the word of exhortation or practise, that they take heed unto, and that is so far well, but as to the word of know∣ledge or prophesie, they never heed that, in which neglect they do not well; but ill. Certainly if it be a duty incumbent upon those to whom the Lord hath committed the word, to preach of these truths concerning <HI>the restauration of Israel,</HI> then it must needs be a duty incumbent upon people to seek af∣ter the knowledge of these truths. But the former of these is true, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31.10.
<Q><HI>Hear</HI> the word of the Lord, O ye Nations, and declare it in the Isles afar off, and say, he that scattered <HI>Israel</HI> will ga∣ther him.</Q>

Indeed men do ill as to themselves, they wrong themselves exceedingly when they neglect to search into these very truths: For it is said, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. <HI>That all Scripture is pro∣fitable,</HI> therefore they that neglect prophetical Scri∣pture, sin against their own spiritual profit and ad∣vantage. And <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.4. The Apostle saith not that some things only,
<Q>but that <HI>whatsoever things</HI> were written afore-time, were written for our <HI>learning.</HI></Q>
He doth not say that matters of pra∣ctice were written for our learning, but as for mat∣ters of prophesie they were written for no bodies learning; the Apostle never spake such a word as that, but he affirms the quite contrary: But especi∣ally the evil of this neglect appears, in that it is great ingratitude unto the most high God for the riches of his grace in condescending to make known his counsels unto the Sons of men. Shall <HI>Iehovah,</HI> who humbleth himself to look upon the things that are done in heaven, condescend so infinitely as to make known his eternal counsels unto men upon the earth. And shall he speak unto us concerning this Mystery of <HI>the restitution of all things,</HI> not only by one, or two, or three, but by the mouth of all his Prophets? And yet shall we mortals be so ungrate∣ful, and so wretched, as to take no notice of what the Lord hath spoken? shall they be as words spo∣ken in the air? shall we let these truths lie by us as if they were of no use? God forbid that it should

be so. One would think that every one should ra∣ther be taken with admiration at the infinite grace of God, as <HI>David</HI> was, <HI>Lord!</HI> (saith he) <HI>that thou shouldst speak to me of things to come:</HI> So it should af∣fect our hearts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God should speak unto us of things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> come▪ therefore not to mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be an evil very hainous and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oking.</P>

That a gracious soul may have much spiritual delight and comfort in diving into these mysterious truths. <HI>Iohn</HI> had experience of this, <HI>Rev.</HI> 10.10. <HI>when I ate the</HI> book, it was in my mouth sweet as honey.</Q>
It is true, that when the book was in his belly, it was bitter, the meaning of which may be, that bitter afflictions should befal the Church during the reign of Antichrist, and in re∣spect of those calamitous events, the book is said to be bitter in his belly. But in his mouth it was sweet as honey, to signifie to us that the understanding of prophesies is a most sweet and comfortable thing. And thus also the Prophet <HI>Ieremy, Chap.</HI> 31.26.
<Q>upon this I awaked, and beheld, and my sleep was sweet unto me, <HI>h. e.</HI> he had newly had a Vision concerning the salvation of all the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>upon this,</HI> his sleep was <HI>sweet</HI> unto him.</Q>
As sleep is a marvellous comfor∣table and <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tale tuum carmen nobis divine Poeta-Quale s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>por fes∣sis, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> refreshing thing unto a man that is weary, so was the con∣templation of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation a marvellous refresh∣ing to the blessed soul of the holy Prophet. The truth is, that whilst a man is dwelling upon these meditations, he is as it were in heaven upon earth, he hath fellowship with the Angels in heaven;
<PB N="154" REF="000143_0102_0FA2637352BF7040"/>
whence the Angel said unto <HI>Iohn, I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets.</HI> When men of God in former times have had their minds taken up with divine Visions, Angels of God have been with them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so it is with the servants of God at this day, though the Ministery of the holy Angels be more secret, spiritual and invisible, than some∣times formerly. When the servants of the Lord are reading, or writing, or meditating, or praying concerning these Mysteries to the great God of Heaven and Earth, the blessed Angels are standing by them all the time; and no doubt but that the se∣ven spirits which stand before the Throne of God, are instruments of much grace and peace towards his servants, especially when they are ingaged in such a work as this is: But there is that which is bet∣ter than fellowship with Angels, even communion with the blessed holy God is to be enjoyed in these Meditations. Yea, much of God is to be seen and felt in these studies. It is said that the Lord hath <HI>made darkness pavillions round about him,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.12.
<Q>And doth not <HI>Solomon</HI> say, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.1. The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick <HI>dark∣ness,</HI> even so it is most true, that God dwelleth in the dark prophesies of his word.</Q>
<HI>There</HI> he is to be seen, <HI>there</HI> are the breathings of his spirit, <HI>there</HI> is a presence of God that is unutterable.</P>
<P>And this I may affirm to you, that if there be any man which hath not had communion with God in looking into these Mysteries (which Angels love to pry into) either it is because he hath no grace in his soul, and these Mysteries indeed are such things as an unregenerate heart can find no sap, nor favour in them. They are the deep things of the spirit of
<PB N="155" REF="000143_0102_0FA2637352BF7040"/>
God, which being spiritually discerned, the natural man cannot see any beauty in them; nay, his heart secretly riseth against them; or else it is because of ignorance and unacquaintedness with the truth of these Mysteries, that a man seeth not much of God in them. And so it is too sadly true, that some of the Lords own children may have very low and un∣worthy thoughts concerning these Mysteries, <HI>scil</HI>▪ through their weakness and ignorance in the Truth. Thus we read concerning the <HI>Disciples</HI> themselves, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.11. that when they were told of Christs Resurrection, they looked upon those <HI>words as idle tales, and believed them not</HI>: So there are that look upon the things that concern <HI>the first Resurrection</HI> as dreams not to be believed. As if these things were only the airy, empty speculations of some men with notions above the clouds: But as for those whose understandings God hath opened to <HI>conceive</HI> and <HI>re∣ceive</HI> these truths they see a glory in them above the world, that eye hath not seen, nor tongue can ex∣press.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Consider</HI> 4. That the time wherein the Myste∣ry of God shall be finished draweth on apace. The salvation of all <HI>Israel,</HI> it is now near to be re∣vealed.</Q>
And this is a marvellous incouragement, to look into this Mystery of <HI>Israels</HI> salvation. For inasmuch as the time of fulfilling prophesies it at hand, we may hope that they shall be unsealed unto those whose hearts are set upon them, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.10. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. <HI>ver.</HI> 11. It was said to <HI>Iohn, Thou must prophesie again</HI>; what is the meaning of that? Is it (as <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sic</HI> Andreas <HI>&amp; qui <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um sequuntur.</HI></NOTE> some have thought) that <HI>Iohn</HI> should
<PB N="156" REF="000143_0103_0FA263735E9A1B40"/>

I'le mention (by the help of Christ) two things unto you, that are signs of this great and no∣table day of the Lord being near. 1.

So then, when the wise
<PB N="157" REF="000143_0103_0FA263735E9A1B40"/>
Virgins are asleep, amongst the rest, this is a sign that Jesus Christ is coming (not to the ultimate judgment, but) as a Bridegroom. This is a sign that the great <HI>and blessed Nuptials</HI> draw on apace, concerning which Christ spake at the Institution of the Lords Supper, saying,
<Q>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine until that day that I drink it new <HI>i. e.</HI> not corporally, but after a spiritual and new kind of manner, <HI>in the kingdom of God, Mark</HI> 14.25.</Q>
Consider also <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.6, 7.
<Q>There was the voice of a great multitude, saying, <HI>Allelu∣jah,</HI> the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her self <HI>ready</HI>:</Q>
When once the <HI>Iews</HI> are converted, then will this voice be heard; then will the Lambs Wife be made ready for the Marriage. Now I say, the fore-going sign of this, is sleeping amongst the Virgins. And alas is it not so now? Are not all the Virgins asleep? what else meaneth that strange spirit of worldliness that possesseth and prevaileth upon great Professors? <HI>Lamentable!</HI> Professors are ready to comply with any thing, though it be to the straining of their consciences; what say they? <HI>we must be wise, we must be wise:</HI> and though the wisdom of the Serpent, devoures the in∣nocency of the Dove, they care not. <HI>Any thing to save an estate</HI>; what though the men we have to do withal be the enemies of God, and of his Saints, yet say they, <HI>Let us comply as far as ever we can.</HI> I do declare unto you, that, the Lord Jesus is coming to shake men out of these slumbers.

Truly, that calm, which was on the earth six or seven years ago, was a prog∣nostick of the Earthquake wherein the witnesses shall be raised, and a tenth part of the City shall fall. Consider the Scriptures, see <HI>Psal.</HI> 46. (which some are wont to call <HI>Luthers</HI> Psalm, because <HI>Luther</HI> was much delighted in the reading and singing thereof.)

<Q>He maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear insunder, he burneth <HI>the chae∣riot in fire</HI>:</Q>
There shall such a day as this come upon the earth, even a day wherein the Nations shall learn War no more; but before this day there must be terrible doings and desolations made upon the earth, as a sign of that glorious tranquillity, which the most high (whose method of divine pro∣vidence, is to bring light out of darkness, good out of evil, order out of confusion, peace out of war) will establish on the earth. I may tell you therefore, that <HI>dreadful wars,</HI> confused noise, and garments rolled in bloud, are a sign of Christ's appearing to establish his kingdom on the Earth. I remember <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="marg">Lactantius <HI>de Divino Praemio</HI> l. 7. c. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Lactantius</HI> (who li∣ved in the third Centu∣ry) hath a saying, that before the Lord Jesus come from Heaven to set up his glorious kingdom here below, <HI>there shall a sword fall from heaven to the earth,</HI> whereby the Saints then living (saith he) shall gather courage, as knowing that ere long, their Lord will come to redeem them out of the hands of all that hate them. Now this is come to pass at this day, there is a sword fallen from Heaven to the Earth, the God of Heaven and Earth hath put all the world into a bloudy frame of revenge and war one against another.

<P><Q><HI>Consider</HI> 5. That some of us are under special advantage to understand these mysterious truths <HI>of God</HI>;</Q>
That is to say, such of us as are in an exi∣led condition in this wilderness. Indeed some came hither upon worldly accounts, but others there are that came into this wilderness purely up∣on spiritual accounts; (yea, and that continue here upon no other account) that so they might bear witness not only against the Name of the Beast, and against his character, but also against his Number (which some good men may be polluted with, though as to the character of the Beast, no good man can receive that) which is the number not of an Angel, but of a man, <HI>h. e.</HI> that so they might bear wit∣ness against all humane inventions in the worship of God, who is exceeding jealous as to the manner and means, as well as in respect to the matter of his worship.

saw Visions of God. And I have often thought up∣on that which is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.3. Namely, <HI>that</HI> John <HI>was led into the wilderness to see the destruction of Rome</HI>: What should be the meaning of that? A Learned <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Viz.</HI> That famous Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert Parker</HI> in his Exposition of the 4. Vial.</NOTE> man and faithful servant of Jesus Christ long since conjectured:
<Q>That therefore some Land should be brought into a very desolate wilderness-condition; and he believed it would be a Protestant Country; yea, and that this de∣solation would be by fire, out of which desolated Land, the ruine of <HI>Rome</HI> shall arise suddenly and <HI>unexpectedly.</HI></Q>
This I mention because of the pre∣sent workings of providence, and God doth some∣times give strange hints to his eminent servants, of what he will do long be∣fore hand. But <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="marg">Brightman <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> ano∣ther thinketh that <HI>Iohn</HI>'s being led into the wilderness to see <HI>Romes</HI> destru∣ction, may signifie, that some faithful ones of God in a wilderness, shall have a wonderful discovery of those things made unto them.

<Q>1. He that would understand these mysteries, must be convinced that they are things intelligi∣ble.</Q>
For this is that which discourageth and keeps off many from looking into these Truths, that they think with themselves there's nothing of certainty in these things, all Interpretations of prophetical mysteries are but conjectural, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as the Apo∣stle speaks of unbelieving prayer, <HI>let not him</HI> that asketh doubting,
<Q>think that he shall receive any thing from <HI>the Lord</HI>:</Q>
So I say in this case; If a man be indeed of that perswasion, that there is no∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng demonstrative in these mysteries, let not such a man think that he shall be able to understand any thing to purpose in these mysteries. I beseech you consider, if it were true which some men of carnal and slothful spirits would make the world believe, that <HI>the book of Revelation</HI> is a book not possible to be understood, would the spirit of God pronounce them blessed, who read (<HI>i. e.</HI> rightly interpret) it? can any man be blessed for reading himself he knows not what, things that no one can under∣stand?

with difficulty.

Sin∣cerity, truth of grace will do much to help one in this case. Hence it is observable, that Christ when he blamed the <HI>Pharisies</HI> for their ignorance in the signs of the times, he doth not call them <HI>fools and blind,</HI> as oft he did, and as they deserved; but he calls them <HI>Hyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crites.

fulfilling what he hath spoken of by his Prophets. Though the works of God, and the word of God, speak plainly enough unto those that have their hearts set upon the truth, to know it; yet as for profane and hypocrites, their minds shall be blind∣ed, and their hearts hardned, that they shall not see nor believe, but <HI>the wise, i. e.</HI> the righteous (for he, and only he, is a wise man in the account of God and Scripture, who is a sincere righteous man) shall understand.

Not only for sincerity, but for a large measure of the spirit of grace. All the Prophets of God were very holy men, <HI>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit,</HI> even so they that would understand the Mystery of God, which he hath declared by his servants the Prophets, had need be very holy: For unto whom will God discover his counsels, but unto those whom he lo∣veth most? As it is amongst men, a wise man will not communicate his secret counsels to every one, but unto such as he hath a peculiar affection for, and delight in; even so we may be sure, the blessed God will not discove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> secret counsels (which have been hidd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the foundation of the world) to every one: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto such as he hath a peculiar respect for.

was <HI>the beloved Disciple</HI>; And <HI>Daniel</HI> was <HI>a man great∣ly beloved</HI>: And that is very observable, which the Lord himself speaketh concerning <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 18.17. <HI>The Lord said, shall I hide from</HI> Abraham <HI>the thing which I do?</HI> I am, saith God, about to bring great changes, strange and dreadful overturnings in the world, for which my name and dread shall be spoken of to all Generations, and shall I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let <HI>Abraham</HI> know of it? a man so dear unto me as <HI>A∣braham</HI> is, shall I not tell him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the thing which I purpose to do?</P>
<P>So that they whom the Lord loveth most, are like to have the clearest Visions and discoveries of his counsels. Now God loveth those most, who have most of the grace of his spirit in their souls. It is true, that as for God's <HI>love of benevolence,</HI> it is without any respect unto grace in the creature, whilst the elect of God are in their bloud, the Lord beareth unto them a love of good will: But as for his <HI>love of complacency</HI> or delight, that is more or less according as men have more or less grace in their souls, whereby they love and fear God.

of the works of God, Mysteries of divine pro∣vidence, as well as mysteries of grace, which he ac∣quaints them with that fear him, that they shall know what God is doing, and about to do in the world, though others know nothing of these mat∣ters.

In that kingdom which the God of hea∣ven shall set up at the day of <HI>Messias</HI> his second co∣ming, his will shall be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Oh! how should we strive in prayer that the coming of this dear and blessed day may be hastned? Besides, the examples of God's ser∣vants, who have prayed for <HI>Israels</HI> salvation, do bind us to do the like. How earnest was the Apostle in his desires after this thing? <HI>Paul</HI> could have been con∣tent
<PB N="179" REF="000143_0114_0FA2637D30A5DB80"/>
that any curse or censure, short of <HI>Maranatha</HI> should have come upon him, even to have been <HI>Anathema</HI> from the Lord, upon condition that the <HI>Israelites</HI> might have been converted and saved; <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.3, 4. &amp; 10.1. <HI>Brethren</HI> (saith he)
<Q><HI>my hearts desire</HI> and prayer to God for <HI>Israel</HI> is that they might be saved.</Q>
He speaketh concerning <HI>the Tribes of Israel,</HI> even of <HI>Israel according to the flesh.</HI> And truly so should it be with us all, our desire, yea our hearts desire and our prayer to God for this <HI>Is∣rael</HI> ought to be, that they may be saved.</P>
<P><Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Consider that we have many promises to encourage us in making this prayer before the Lord.</Q>
We have not only promises, that the thing shall come to pass in due time, which is encourage∣ment enough; but it is promised, that we our selves shall be no loosers by praying for this thing.
<Q>If <HI>David</HI> could say that when he fought unto God for his enemies, that his prayer returned into his own bosom:</Q>
Surely we shall find, that when in since∣rity we seek unto God for <HI>Israel,</HI> that prayer will re∣turn into our own bosom. Remember what the Lord saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.6.
<Q>pray for the peace of <HI>Ie∣rusalem,</HI> they shall prosper that love <HI>thee:</HI></Q>
And though the words are to be extended unto <HI>Mystical,</HI> there is no reason why <HI>Literal Ierusalem</HI> should be excluded out of that Text. See also <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.6. <HI>I will give</HI> (saith he, who is <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega) to him that is athirst, of the fountain of the water of life freely.</HI> To him that is a thirst, for what? even to him that is a∣thirst for the salvation of <HI>Israel,</HI> for the conversion of the <HI>Iews,</HI> for the creating of the new heaven and the new earth which is promised, to him that is thus athirst will the Lord give of the fountain of the wa∣ter of life freely.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="000143_0115_0FA2637DE745E8C8"/>
<Q><HI>Consider</HI> 3. There was a time when the <HI>Israelite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> did pray for us, therefore in equity we should pray for them.</Q>
Time was when the <HI>Iews</HI> were the people of God, and <HI>Gentiles</HI> were not so: And then did they pray for the conversion of <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that <HI>Gentiles</HI> might have the saving health of God ex∣tended towards them, and the breasts of divine Or∣dinances to suck grace and consolation from. There∣fore inasmuch as the case is now quite altered, that the <HI>Iews</HI> are not the people of God, but many a∣mongst the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are so: we should in like man∣ner pray for them, that they may see the salvation of the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 67. <HI>per totum, Cant.</HI> 8.8.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Consider</HI> 4. Prayer may be a means to hasten the coming of this glorious day of <HI>Israels</HI> salva∣tion.</Q>
Would we not have <HI>Sion</HI> to be delivered, and that speedily? pour forth earnest and conti∣nual prayer, and it will hasten the birth of <HI>Sion,</HI> that even a Nation shall be born in one day. It is prayer that sets the wheels of divine providence a going; It is prayer that turns the world upside down. Therefore you may observe, that seldom doth any great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>teration of the state and face of things come to pass in the world, but the Lord first sends down a spirit of prayer into the hearts of his Saints,
<Q>and that shaketh heaven and earth in pieces in a short time.</Q>
Observe then (my friends, and brethren, beloved in the Lord) and be awakened this day, I say, observe, that when the prayers of Saints ascend before the Throne of God, with the incense of the merits and intercession of the Lord Jesus, there fol∣loweth upon it <HI>thundrings, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake, Rev.</HI> 8.4, 5. would you then see that <HI>earth∣quake</HI> wherein <HI>the mountains of prey, that devour Israel,</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="000143_0115_0FA2637DE745E8C8"/>
shall be brought low, and wherein <HI>the Lords house,</HI> which is now trampled upon, <HI>shall be exalted</HI> on the tops of the mountains? Oh then pray as for your lives <HI>all manner of prayer,</HI> even publick prayer, fami∣ly prayer secret prayer; and in all stir up your selves to call upon the Lord, and say,
<Q>awake, a∣wake, O arm of the Lord as in the days of old; awake, as in the years of ancient generations, that <HI>Sion</HI> may return with singing, and everlasting joy upon her head.</Q></P>
<P>And shall I tell you (yea from the Lord I will tell you) that the prayers of poor despicable ones, that know, and fear, and serve God, can do great things with him that doth even whatsoever he please∣eth in heaven, and on earth, and in all deep places. Oh consider of it! I remember <HI>Melancthon</HI> (that great and Learned Divine) saith,
<Q>he was much en∣couraged to hope that God would carry on the work of Reformation in <HI>Germany</HI> (and the Lord did carry it on with great success in those days) because he understood that there were many poor godly women, that were wont to meet together to pray that the work of Reformation might go <HI>forward:</HI></Q>
Even so if the Lord stir up the hearts of his poor servants to favour the dust of <HI>Sion,</HI> and to shew it by earnest prayer before him at all times, surely the day will not be long before the Lord ap∣pear in glory to build up <HI>Sion,</HI> for he will have re∣gard to the prayer of the destitute, and he will not despise their prayer. Know ye this, yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> servants of the Lord, to your everlasting encouragement. <HI>But thou O Lord how long! how long! how long!</HI></P>
