<HEAD>TO THE SOUTH CHURCH IN BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE many times wonder'd in my Travels a∣abroad at the mysterious <HI>Reasons</HI> of <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> in carrying Me forth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">April <HI>1. 1709.</HI></NOTE> &amp; detaining Me so long from Returning <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">July <HI>20. 1717.</HI></NOTE> to My <HI>Native Land.</HI> Tho' <HI>GOD</HI> has endow'd Us with the Power of Reason to direct Us in all Our De∣signs &amp; Actions, &amp; in the Course of my Tra∣vels I was then ready to think I was Gene∣rally Guided thereby; Yet I must needs ac∣knowledge, that whenever I have made Reflections on that Part of My Life, I have not been able to see with Satisfaction the Reasonableness or Consistency of it. I have been often sur∣prized to consider, how I have been unaccountably governed by various Views &amp; Motives, &amp; successively led on from One to Another till they all intirely vanished but the Prospect &amp; Love of My <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>UPON My <HI>Arrival,</HI> It seems as if I am awakened out of a long &amp; continued Train of Dreams &amp; Amusements, &amp; have been insensibly wandering in Visionary Regions of Delusion &amp; Er∣rour. But now Methinks I clearly see that a Wise &amp; Designing Hand has over-rul'd &amp; led Me, &amp; some of the Ends of His Mysterious Dealings appear with Amazement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the others remain con∣cealed for the Exercise of my awful Reverence &amp; profound Adoration.</P>
<P><PB REF="001996_0003_0FBA4D8B346EC678"/>MY Reception into My <HI>Native Country</HI> with so great Re∣spect &amp; Affection I must account to be One of the happiest <HI>Scenes</HI> in all My Life. I was so young &amp; unknown when I left it, that I had hardly contracted any other Acquaintance than among my contemporary <HI>Students</HI> at <HI>Colledge:</HI> And I had spent such a Series of Years abroad, as I thought They had almost lost their Affection &amp; Remembrance of Me. It must therefore needs be a surprizing &amp; inexpressible Joy to find Myself at my Arrival embrac'd &amp; surrounded with Numbers of Friends, &amp; many that seem'd to know Me at Once, tho' They never saw Me before. I cou'd not forbear imagining Myself as Happy as the <HI>Roman Orator,</HI> if the Reader will forgive the bold Com∣parison, when He returned to <HI>the City</HI> in Triumph; Tho' I dare not speak as He, That <HI>the Pleasures of that single Day were almost preferable to Immortality.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as there is an unavoidable &amp; perpetual Succession of Delight &amp; Trouble in Humane Life; I quickly found that I must exchange my Scenes of Diversion &amp; Pleasure into the contrary Scenes of Care &amp; Business. And these have surprized Me as much as the other.</P>
<P>THE sudden Invitation of so desirable &amp; considerable a Church &amp; Town as <HI>Hingham</HI> within <HI>Eight &amp; Forty Hours</HI> of my Landing &amp; their Call in a little Time after, together with <HI>Yours</HI> at the same Conjuncture and the Motion of <HI>Another,</HI> for which I bare a peculiar Esteem and Affection, as well as to Their most Reverend, Pious &amp; Learned <HI>Pastors,</HI> must needs involve Me in the greatest Perplexities, &amp; astonish my Mind.</P>
<P>I COU'D hardly imagine Myself duely Qualifyed for the Ministerial Office, &amp; shou'd scarcely have ingaged in it, were it not for the Perswasion of Others, &amp; the repeated Call of Pro∣vidence by so many Churches. I had denyed the Sollicitations of <HI>Two</HI> in <HI>England</HI> before; Of <HI>Battisford</HI> &amp; <HI>Combs</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jan. <HI>29. 1713, 14</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and afterwards of a larger Society that al∣ternately meets at <HI>Winden</HI> and <HI>Clavering</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Octob. <HI>31. 1714.</HI></NOTE> on the Borders of <HI>Cambridgshire</HI> and <HI>Essex.</HI> I was now therefore seized with Fear, lest <HI>GOD</HI> who knew My Unfitness &amp; Sin, shou'd over-rule these extraordinary Things for my utter Confu∣sion. The Anxiety &amp; Distress of my Soul has been beyond Expression: And with a Concurrence at the same Conjuncture of various other Extraordinary Temptations &amp; Troubles wou'd have overwhelm'd &amp; sunk Me without a Divine Support: As
<PB REF="001996_0004_0FBA4D8E039684A0"/>
indeed they have made such unusual Impressions on Me, that I have not yet intirely recovered that Sedateness of Temper which I thank <HI>GOD</HI> is so Natural to Me, &amp; had been a firm &amp; per∣petual Proof against all the Difficulties of my Preceeding Life.</P>
<P>I HAVE spoken of some of these Things already in my Re∣ply to Your Call &amp; the succeeding Discourse, Together with the Principal Motives that determined me to Enter into the Sa∣cred Office, &amp; to Accept of Your Flock for My Peculiar Charge. I shall not therefore here repeat them, nor wou'd it be conveni∣ent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prudent to offer the Reasons of My not yielding to the Call of <HI>Bristol.</HI> But You will give Me leave on this Occasion, Because 'tis Justice &amp; Gratitude, To express My Grateful Resentments &amp; the Singular Love &amp; Honour I owe to that Kind &amp; Worthy People, as well as the Others beforementioned, who have all unanimously Called Me, &amp; all but One have sur∣prized Me with the most undeserved Respect of Choosing Me as soon as ever they knew Me. May They all be the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter supply∣ed by My not settling with Them, as it is with great Satisfaction I behold the Church at <HI>Hingham</HI> to be.</P>
<P>BUT if You can bear Me with Patience, I wou'd now pro∣ceed to offer a few Things more before I conclude.</P>
<P>IN the First Place I wou'd Here observe, That I not only look upon those in <HI>full Comunion</HI> to belong to Our Ministeri∣al Care; But all Those also at least that have been admitted Members of Your Ecclesiastical Body at their receiving the <HI>Bap∣tismal Seal</HI> of the Covenant. I take it for Granted You will readily own it: But I mention it Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to make You sensible of the cast &amp; dreadful Aggravation which it gives of the Weight of Our Charge. You will easily conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve what I say, When it appears from the Records that the Church was founded on the <HI>12.</HI> of <HI>May 1669;</HI> And since that Time to this which is not yet <HI>Fifty</HI> Years, to <HI>Seven Hundred Communicants</HI> &amp; near as ma∣ny more that have Own'd the <HI>Covenant,</HI> there have been about <HI>Five Thousand Baptized</HI> Persons. The Tho't of This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough to shock the greatest Capacity, &amp; to make us cry out with <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Num. 11.14.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>We are not able to bear all this People alone, Because it is too Heavy for Us</HI>!</P>
<P>THERE is another Consideration which affects Me with the utmost Concern &amp; Abasement; And that is My succeeding such Great &amp; Illustrious Persons as have so conspicuously distin∣guish'd
<PB REF="001996_0005_0FBA4D9124B9B7D8"/>
&amp; adorn'd Your Society, &amp; made it the more Renowned &amp; Venerable throughout all this Country. Men on whose Hands if alive I were unworthy to pour our Water, as <HI>Elisha</HI> the Son of <HI>Shaphat</HI> on the Hands of His Master <HI>Elijah</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>2 Kings 3.11.</HI></NOTE>. Oh that as I take up their Mantle, the Character &amp; Badge of their Office, I might receive &amp; enjoy their Ministerial Spirit!</P>
<P>THE First of Your Pastors which was the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thatcher,</HI> is beyond the Personal Knowledge &amp; Remembrance of most among You. But by the Memorial of his Iafe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dr. <HI>Ma∣ther's</HI> Church-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>story, He appears to have been a Man of Singular Abilities &amp; Learning, &amp; a great Variety of uncommon Accom∣plishments. To this Account, I have learned from Those that were acquainted with Him, That He was a Person of great Humani∣ty, Meekness &amp; Sweetness of Temper. He was settled among You on <HI>February 16. 1669, 70.</HI> &amp; Died on <HI>October 15. 1678,</HI> at <HI>58</HI> Years of Age.</P>
<P>HIS Successor was the Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> the Learned <HI>Vice-President</HI> of <HI>Harvard Colledge.</HI> We were all acquainted with Him, &amp; shall ever revere his Memory. Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> has given Us His exquisite Picture with a Masterly Hand in his Funeral Sermon: And He has been universally owned to have been One of the Wisest &amp; most Generous Men, &amp; One of the Greatest Divines which these Parts of the World have produ∣ced. I shall never forget His admired Expositions Twice a Week in the <HI>Hall,</HI> His Gracious Deportment, nor the copious, exact, &amp; pathetical Prayers He as frequently poured out a∣mong Us. I must ever Remember Him with peculiar Esteem &amp; Gratitude for the Heavenly Gravity, Condescention &amp; melting Affection wherewith he treated me in my tender Years, when he took me aside at <HI>Colledge</HI> to incourage &amp; direct me in the Affairs of my Soul. He was settled among You on <HI>April 10. 1678.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sewall</HI> &amp; <HI>I</HI> were Two of the last who received their <HI>Degrees</HI> from Him, which was on <HI>July 2. 1707,</HI> &amp; He dyed the <HI>12</HI>th of <HI>September</HI> after, at <HI>68</HI> Years of Age.</P>
<P>IT has been my great Unhappiness &amp; Sorrow, that I was never in Company with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> that ex∣traordinary Person who follow'd Him, Before I went out of the Country I have often heard him with the greatest Admiration &amp; Pleasure; methought he spake like a Flaming <HI>Seraph.</HI> Upon my Return I find he has left as Great a Character for Superior Abilities &amp; Universal Learning as any that have gone before
<PB REF="001996_0006_0FBA4D9289C893E0"/>
Him. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> &amp; my Reverend <HI>Colleague</HI> have drawn it in its lively Colours in their Funeral Sermons. It is a very Grateful &amp; Singular Honour to have the follow∣ing &amp; excellent Remains of His inclos'd in the same Cover with Mine. He was Ordained among You on <HI>August 28. 1700,</HI> &amp; Deceased <HI>February 13. 1716,</HI> at <HI>45</HI> Years of Age.</P>
<P>WHEN I consider of My standing up in the Room of such extraordinary Persons as These, &amp; in One of the most Nume∣rous▪ Honourable, Learned and Judicious Auditories I know in the World; It must needs Surprize Me with Shame and Anxi∣ety, and throw My Mind into a great Degree of Consternation &amp; Terror.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in the midst of all My Distress, I must own that thro' the over-ruling Wisdom &amp; Goodness of <HI>GOD</HI> I am now settled in the Happiest Country &amp; in One of the Delightfullest Towns upon Earth. It is an invaluable Priviledge that I now <HI>Here</HI> enjoy, In living among such Numbers of Persons of every Order that so illustriously shine in Piety, Justice, Tempe∣rance &amp; Social Virtues. It is a singular Advantage which I could hardly find any where-else, to be fix'd in a Constellation of such Eminent Ministers, united in the same Design &amp; Affection: Three of whom have done Me the Honour to accompany Me in the following Pages, and for their various Excellencies I find are justly Renowned &amp; Esteemed abroad.</P>
<P>I MUST likewise admire the same over-ruling Wisdom &amp; Goodness, in settling among you about <HI>Five</HI> Years before, Mr. <HI>Sewall</HI> Your Reverend Pastor, My Classmate, the Compani∣on of My Youth, and one of My Dearest &amp; most Intimate Friends at <HI>Colledge.</HI> As this has been a very powerful Incentive and Incouragement to Me to submit &amp; associate with Him in the same <HI>Ministerial Service;</HI> So it seems to be a most hopeful Foundation, if <HI>GOD</HI> is pleased to continue Our Lives, of the greatest Advantage &amp; Pleasure. Our Nearness of Age, Our Conformity of Inclinations &amp; Principles, Our long &amp; early Acquaintance &amp; Friendship, the peculiar Communion &amp; Inti∣macy, wherewith We have often unbosom'd Our Souls; and especially the Raising Our Respect and Affection on the substan∣tial <HI>Basis</HI> of Religion &amp; Virtue, does already support &amp; ani∣mate Me to proceed in My Work, and afford Me the lively Pros∣pect of so much Happiness as I am sometimes afraid is too great to be looked for, or not long enjoyed in this evil &amp; changeable World.</P>

May We attract Your Cordial and Religious Esteem and Love, and Return them into Your Bosoms, by more chearful and lively Indeavours for Your present Comfort and Welfare and Everlasting Happiness. May We be more and more ingaged and devoted to You, and be more heartily willing to Do and Suffer any thing for You, To Bare any thing from you, And to resolve with the Apostle, <HI>2 Cor. 12.15. That we will very gladly spend and be spent for your Souls</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, <HI>Tho' the more abundantly We Love You the Less We be Loved.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> Let us all endeavour to be mutual Incourage∣ments &amp; Consolations in this World, that we may be mutual Joys and Delights in the Other, Let us Remember and I∣mitate the many <HI>Ornaments</HI> of Our Church and diligently move on in the fair Tracks of Light they have left behind them till We ascend and meet them in the Heavenly World. And in the mean while Let Us also aspire to excell in Our Sever∣al Stations and Employments, and strive which shall appear to be the more Laborious and Watchful <HI>Pastors,</HI> or the more Peaceable and Fruitful <HI>People.</HI></P>

appears from several remarkable Passages, &amp; from the Scope and Subject of the whole, as well as ancient History; that it was directed to the <HI>He∣brews</HI> who had imbrac'd the Christian Religion in the Province of <HI>Judea,</HI> &amp; especially those who li∣ved at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>THE Churches in those Places were then very numerous as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> tells us, &amp; had suffer'd a World of Trouble in the Confusions that fell out upon the Death of <HI>Festus</HI> &amp; the Succession of <HI>Al∣binus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Governours <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, Owen.</HI></NOTE>. The Miseries &amp; Outrage of those Days are describ'd in a lively manner by <HI>Josephus</HI>: And the Professors of CHRIST had a peculiar Share in them, as they were hated by every Party, &amp; our Apostle intimates in the <HI>Tenth Chapter,</HI> at the 31<HI>st,</HI>—34<HI>th Verses.</HI></P>
<P>BUT about this time they were harrass'd in a particular manner by one <HI>Ananus</HI> a malignant <HI>Sadducee,</HI> who had been exalted to the High-Priest∣hood by King <HI>Agrippa</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Owen,</HI></NOTE>. For as a Learned Man <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fell.</HI></NOTE> oberves, 'Tho' the <HI>Hebrew Christians</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> were more inclin'd than others to the Jewish Worship, ad∣joining it to Christianity as necessary to Salvation; yet they were more grieviously persecuted <HI>There</HI> than in other Places: The <HI>Jews</HI> having a peculiar Hatred &amp; Contempt of CHRIST, &amp; a greater Pow∣er There by the Laws or Permission of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. By Reproaches, Censures, Fines, Stripes, Imprisonments &amp; other Sufferings, some <HI>Hebrew Christians</HI> had deserted their Assemblies <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.25.</NOTE>, &amp; others their Profession <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 6.4, &amp;c. &amp; <HI>chap.</HI> 10.26.</NOTE>: Hoping They might still obtain Salvation, as They might have done before They imbrac'd the Gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001996_0010_0FBA4D9A99B6AFF8"/>THEY were more easily reduc'd to the intire Ob∣servance of their <HI>old Religion</HI>; Because they had never yet abandon'd it, but were very zealous for it. They had received CHRIST as the true <HI>Messias</HI>; But they would not leave Their ancient Covenant nor any of the Laws of GOD by <HI>Moses.</HI> The Coun∣cil at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had indeed decided that They shou'd not be impos'd on the <HI>Gentile Converts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 15.23.</NOTE>: But <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine</HI> Years after <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Owen.</HI></NOTE>, when our Apostle returned thither; His Brother <HI>James</HI> informs Him that many thousands of the Believing <HI>Jews</HI> were very zealous for the Law, &amp; accounted Their <HI>own Nation</HI> were still oblig'd to keep it <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts 21.17,—21.</NOTE>. They there∣fore held Their Assemblys distinct from the Christi∣an Gentiles throwout the World, as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> ob∣serves from <HI>Jerom</HI> &amp; some ancient Writers.

<P><PB N="5" REF="001996_0012_0FBA4D9E588348A8"/>HERE is 1. a <HI>Duty</HI>: And 2. the Motives or <HI>Rea∣sons</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. HERE is an important <HI>Duty</HI> prescribed to the Christian Hebrews. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over You, &amp; submit Yourselves.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>Those that had the Rule over Them</HI> the Apostle cou'd not mean Their Civil Rulers. The <HI>Rulers</HI> here intended are represented in the following Part of the <HI>Verse</HI> to be such, whose Office 'twas to watch for their Souls, as Those that must give Account; which is not the Civil Rulers Office. And if it cou'd be, the <HI>Hebrew Christians</HI> then had none in the Magistratick Order to take such No∣tice of Them. He cou'd therefore mean no other than the <HI>Spiritual Rulers</HI> of Their <HI>Churches.</HI> They must be those who had the peculiar Care of Souls committed to Them: &amp; the same He mention'd in the <HI>Seventh Verse</HI>; where the Word in the <HI>Original</HI> is the same as here, &amp; apply'd to Those who had Preach'd the Word of God unto them: As <HI>Calvin</HI> &amp; <HI>Pareus</HI> observe.</P>
<P>WE are to <HI>obey</HI> these spiritual Rulers &amp; <HI>submit</HI> Ourselves unto Them. <HI>i. e.</HI> We are to obey Them &amp; submit Ourselves unto Them in <HI>Spiritual Things,</HI> &amp; according to those <HI>Instructions</HI> They receive from CHRIST &amp; the <HI>Laws</HI> &amp; <HI>Constitutions</HI> of His <HI>Hea∣venly Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>IN such Respects as these We are to obey Them &amp; submit Ourselves unto Them. <HI>i. e.</HI> as a Learned Man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leigh,</HI> &amp; <HI>Fell.</HI></NOTE> expounds it; We are to obey Them in the <HI>Truths</HI> they Preach, &amp; submit Ourselves unto Them in the due Administration of Their <HI>Discipline</HI> &amp; Authority. The Words are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; Which
<PB N="6" REF="001996_0013_0FBA4DA06D1365F0"/>
seem to represent the <HI>Two-fold</HI> Duty of People to Their Spiritual Rulers — <HI>Obedience</HI> &amp; <HI>Submission:</HI> There being <HI>Two</HI> Sorts of Things which We are subject to, <HI>viz.</HI> Their <HI>Teaching</HI> &amp; Their <HI>Disci∣pline</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leigh.</HI></NOTE>. We are to obey Them in the wholsome Truths &amp; Precepts They deliver, for Our Belief &amp; Practice: And We are quietly to submit to the regular Exercise of Their Authority, that the Peace &amp; Unity, Strength &amp; Beauty of the Church may be preserved.</P>
<P>THIS in General is the <HI>Duty</HI> of People to Their Spiritual Rulers.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE have then the <HI>Reasons</HI> or Motives urging to the ready Performance of it. <HI>For They watch for Your Souls, as Those that must give Account: That They may do it with Joy, &amp; not with Grief,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Apostle founds the <HI>Reasonableness</HI> of the <HI>Peoples Duty,</HI> upon Their <HI>Spiritual Rulers</HI> awful &amp; important <HI>Office</HI> &amp; Concern for Those committed to Them: And <HI>every Word</HI> He uses is exceeding cogent &amp; emphatical.</P>
<P><HI>THEY</HI> have the Charge of <HI>Your</HI> most precious &amp; immortal <HI>Souls</HI>: They <HI>watch for</HI> the Security &amp; Salvation of them in the midst of a thousand dreadful Dangers: They <HI>must give an Account</HI> of what They do for You, &amp; of what Treatment They meet with from You. They must give up Their Account either with <HI>Joy</HI> or <HI>Grief.</HI> It will be ex∣ceeding happy both for You &amp; Them, if They give up Their Account with perfect Joy: But dread∣ful &amp; pernicious, if They must give it up with Sorrow.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001996_0014_0FBA4DA187470598"/><HI>IT is as if He shou'd say—</HI></P>
<P><HI>THEY</HI> are set over You for <HI>Your own Advantage</HI>: Their painful &amp; laborious <HI>Business</HI> is to <HI>watch</HI> for <HI>Your Souls</HI> &amp; the Salvation of them, &amp; They have a most awful <HI>Account</HI> to give to GOD. It is there∣fore highly <HI>reasonable, equal &amp; becoming,</HI> that <HI>You</HI> shou'd yield a peaceable &amp; ready Obedience &amp; Submission to <HI>Them</HI>: That <HI>You</HI> shou'd thereby show <HI>Your</HI> just &amp; grateful Sence of the Pains &amp; La∣bours <HI>They</HI> undergo, the Benefits <HI>You</HI> receive <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Piscator.</HI></NOTE> &amp; the dreadful Hazard <HI>They</HI> expose Themselves unto for <HI>Your</HI> Salvation. If <HI>They</HI> duly watch, &amp; <HI>You</HI> obey Their wholsome Word &amp; submit to Their Spiritual Rule &amp; Conduct; <HI>They</HI> will both be chearful in Their watching for Your Souls, They will happily promote the Welfare &amp; Salvation of them, &amp; They will give up Their Account with Joy. But if either <HI>They</HI> neglect Their Business, or <HI>You</HI> be refractory to Their Authority or disobedient to their Doctrine; They will have a sorrowful Account to give. Or tho' <HI>They</HI> be faithful &amp; so save Themselves; yet They will bitterly mourn &amp; complain to GOD of <HI>Your</HI> Ungratefulness &amp; Sin: And their Groans &amp; Sorrows will be of no Advan∣tage to Your Souls, but exceeding hurtful &amp; pernicious to the Salvation of them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Piscator, Brandmiller,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS is the Main Intention of the <HI>Text,</HI> &amp; this the <HI>Occasion</HI> of it's being introduced. It is alledg'd as a most powerful &amp; obliging Argument for the <HI>People,</HI> to live in due Obedience &amp; Submission to Their <HI>Spiritual Rulers.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I stand not here this Day so much to in∣form You of <HI>Your Obligations to Them</HI>; as to give
<PB N="8" REF="001996_0015_0FBA4DA2F6C4BC98"/>
You some Apprehensions of <HI>My Duty unto You,</HI> &amp; that awful &amp; tremendous Office I am going to undertake at the Hands of CHRIST, &amp; that most heavy Charge &amp; Burthen that is to be imposed on Me.</P>
<P>I SHALL not therefore consider the <HI>Words</HI> with respect to the primary Design of the Apostle in them, or their Connection with what preceeds &amp; brings them in. I shall only now insist on their plain &amp; <HI>single Meaning</HI> in the following</P>
<P><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Your Spiritual Rulers are to watch for Your Souls, as Those that must give Account: That They may do it with Joy, &amp; not with Grief.</P>

<P>THERE are so many Things to be explain'd in our <HI>Text</HI> &amp; <HI>Doctrine,</HI> &amp; such a Number &amp; Variety

<P>THIS is plainly implied in the Text before Us▪ [<HI>For They—] i. e.</HI> Those who rule over You, in the preceeding Part of the <HI>Verse,</HI> &amp; We have al∣ready proved to be <HI>Spiritual Rulers.</HI> And They [<HI>watch for Your Souls</HI>—] which implies that Your Souls are committed to Them, &amp; are Their peculiar Charge. Their Spiritual Care &amp; Rule appear to be inseparable &amp; of equal Dimension: For Those who <HI>rule</HI> over You, says the Apostle, <HI>watch</HI> for Your Souls. Your Souls are commit∣ted to Their Care &amp; Watch, as well as to Their Government &amp; Authority. They can be none of Your Rulers, if They do not watch for Your Souls: &amp; if this be not Their Care &amp; Business, You by this Precept owe Them neither Obedience nor Submission <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calvin, Pareus, Owen.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001996_0017_0FBA4DA5F9622B98"/>BUT They cannot watch for nor give Account of all the Souls throwout the World; &amp; there∣fore They cannot be <HI>Universal Rulers.</HI> Their Charge must be confin'd to such a Number, &amp; not exceed it, as They can duely watch for, as well as lead &amp; govern.

<P N="1">I. <HI>WHO are the</HI> Spiritual Rulers <HI>here intended, &amp; what in General is Their Ruling Power &amp; Office.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is more comprehensive than the <HI>English</HI>-RULERS, or any other Word now in use; &amp; therefore variously render'd by Learned Men.

<P>IN Short, It is a <HI>General Term</HI> including all of whatever Denomination, that have any Autho∣ritative Office in any particular Society of Pro∣fessing Christians. They are any Officers in any Church of CHRIST whatever that have a Power either of Ruling or Instructing: Call Them <HI>Bishops, Pastors, Teachers, Presbyters, Elders, Ministers,</HI> or any other Name the Scriptures give Them. They are all included in this Ge∣neral Term.</P>
<P>THE Word indeed is of so extensive a Sig∣nification as to comprehend the Charge &amp; Office both of <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> of <HI>Military Leaders,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Tutors or Trainers up of Youth.</HI> But applied to the Heads of Christian Churches, it includes these <HI>Three</HI> Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT They are to <HI>Govern</HI> &amp; overule the Society committed to Them in Wisdom, Justice &amp; Authority, &amp; keep it in Peace &amp; Order.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT They are to order, <HI>Defend</HI> &amp; guide it in the midst of all it's Spiritual Enemies; with attentive &amp; unwearied Sagacity, Vigilance &amp; Resolution.</P>

Doctrine: And train Them up with Integrity &amp; Care to the Knowledge &amp; Performance of Their various Duties.</P>
<P>BUT Their <HI>Rule</HI> is entirely restrain'd to <HI>Spi∣ritual Things</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh 18.36. &amp; 2 Cor. 10.3,—5.</NOTE>, &amp; to be exercis'd &amp; directed by the <HI>Laws</HI> of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THEY must keep &amp; move &amp; shine in the proper &amp; peculiar <HI>Sphaere</HI> assign'd Them, &amp; not vary from it, or extend Their Reigning Power, tho' They may Their Generous Influence of Light &amp; Warmth without it. They may be concern'd with <HI>Temporal Affairs</HI> in Moderation, Advice &amp; Council, as becomes every <HI>Private Member</HI> of the Civil Body.

<P>IN Fine, They must keep to the Limits of Their <HI>Divine Commission,</HI> &amp; teach &amp; govern by it: And
<PB N="13" REF="001996_0020_0FBA4DB055899490"/>
when They do so, They may speak &amp; act with great Assurance, Resolution &amp; Authority. The Authority wherewith They teach &amp; rule is not meerly Theirs: But as They do what CHRIST directs Them; it is the awful Authority of CHRIST Himself Our Glorious <HI>Sovereign</HI> exerted by Them, &amp; which He will not suffer to be tram∣pled on or disregarded, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.15—18. <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.19—23.</P>
<P>THESE are the <HI>Spiritual Rulers</HI> here intend∣ed, &amp; this in General is Their Ruling Authori∣ty, Power &amp; Office. Let us now consider</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WHAT is this</HI> Committing Your Souls <HI>to Their peculiar Care, &amp;</HI> By Whom <HI>is it done.</HI></P>
<P>IT does <HI>Not</HI> imply as if the Care of Your Souls were so devolved on Your <HI>Ministers,</HI> as to relieve or excuse <HI>You</HI> from the Care of them. <HI>Your</HI> Care of them is never a whit diminished by Your <HI>Ministers</HI> taking the Charge of them. <HI>You</HI> are rather obliged to take the greater Care of Your∣selves; or the Care of Your <HI>Ministers</HI> may be vain &amp; fruitless to You, &amp; only serve to enhance Your present Sin, &amp; Your future Doom &amp; Mi∣sery.</P>
<P>BUT it implies that Your Spiritual Welfare is of great Importance, &amp; Your Souls have the greatest need to be cared for &amp; looked after. They have not only need of <HI>Your own</HI> utmost Care; But also of a <HI>peculiar Order</HI> of Men ap∣pointed to this only Business, to mind them, &amp; do their utmost to secure the Welfare &amp; Sal∣vation of them. This is the peculiar Work of
<PB N="14" REF="001996_0021_0FBA4DB1DCF792B8"/>
Your <HI>Spiritual Guides</HI> &amp; <HI>Rulers,</HI> &amp; the great &amp; continual Concern of Their Lives. They have the Care of Your Souls Salvation &amp; Spiritual &amp; Eternal Welfare committed to Them. But <HI>By Whom</HI> is it done?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> ascribe the Creation of the Ministerial Office to GOD, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. &amp; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5, 6. By GOD we are to understand the DEITY, comprehending the FATHER, SON, &amp; HOLY GHOST; Who are all concern'd in this Sacred &amp; Important Action. It is therefore al∣so distinctly ascrib'd to <HI>Every</HI> Person of the Bles∣sed TRINITY. To the FATHER, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.31. To CHRIST the SON, in <HI>Acts</HI> 20.24. &amp; <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.8—13. And to the HOLY GHOST, in <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28.</P>
<P>THEY do not only all concur in this great Affair by Their <HI>Will, Appointment</HI> &amp; <HI>Approbati∣on</HI>; But They have every One a <HI>peculiar Work</HI> &amp; <HI>Influence</HI> in providing Ministers &amp; committing the Care of Your Souls unto Them. The FATHER has <HI>willed</HI> &amp; <HI>given</HI> Them to the SON <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Joh. 3.35. &amp; 13.3. &amp; 17.1—12.</NOTE> to purchase &amp; bestow on the needy Souls of Sin∣ners. The SON has <HI>purchas'd</HI> Them &amp; the <HI>Power of bestowing</HI> Them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.18—20.</NOTE> on the Souls of Men. The HOLY GHOST does <HI>accomplish</HI> &amp; <HI>introduce</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 20.28.</NOTE> Them into Their Sacred Office.</P>
<P>BUT We are directed in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> to have a peculiar View to GOD the SON in or∣dering Ministers to take the Care of You. He is represented upon His Ascent on High, as the Sovereign <HI>Lord</HI> &amp; <HI>Ruler</HI> of the whole Creation, &amp; as giving Them this Divine Commission<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.8—13. &amp; 1 Tim. 1.1, 12.</NOTE>. The Care
<PB N="15" REF="001996_0022_0FBA4DB497A154E8"/>
of Your Souls is committed to Your Ministers in such a peculiar manner by CHRIST Himself the <HI>Saviour</HI> of them, &amp; <HI>Lord</HI> of all Things. But</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>BY what</HI> Ways <HI>&amp;</HI> Means <HI>is it perform'd &amp; effected.</HI></P>
<P>HE may constitute such Rulers over You ei∣ther by His Appearance in <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> as He did Our Apostles &amp; the <HI>First</HI> Disciples; Or by the <HI>miraculous Descent</HI> of His HOLY SPIRIT, as He often did in the early Ages of <HI>Christianity.</HI> But such <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Ways as Those are long since ceas'd, &amp; now He does it by such <HI>Ordinary</HI> &amp; common Ways &amp; Means as <HI>These.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. BY <HI>Your</HI> lawful <HI>Choice</HI> or Consent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. BY <HI>Their Acceptance.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. BY <HI>Their</HI> Solemn <HI>Ordination.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. BY the <HI>Scriptures, His</HI> revealed <HI>Word.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. BY the <HI>Operation</HI> of His HOLY SPIRIT.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Your Ministers have the Care of Your Souls committed to Them by Means of</HI> Your <HI>lawful</HI> Choice <HI>or Consent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YOUR Choice</HI> or Consent is <HI>Lawful</HI> when it is freely &amp; fairly made by the Greater Part of the Society, &amp; the Other have no Objection to Their Unsuitableness or Insufficiency to take Care of Your Souls. And that every Community has a Right to such a Choice, is most plainly founded on the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> which are the Laws of CHRIST <NOTE PLACE="foot">Joh. 1.1—10.</NOTE>. The Apostles discerned it, &amp; acted
<PB N="16" REF="001996_0023_0FBA4DB5EB8D98E0"/>
according to it in an inferior Office, in <HI>Acts</HI> 6.3—6. They directed the People to choose Their <HI>Deacons,</HI> in Their Presence; &amp; then the Apostles ordain'd Them. If We have a Right to choose Our Officers to take Care of Our <HI>Earthly Trea∣sures</HI> and Bodily Wants; We have infinitely a greater Right to the Choice of Those who are to take Care of Our <HI>Immortal Souls,</HI> which are in∣finitely more precious &amp; dear unto Us, &amp; the Salvation of them of infinitely greater Moment! <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.26 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark 8.36, 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS is therefore a plain Institution of CHRIST, Both by the Laws of Nature, &amp; Apostolical Ex∣ample &amp; Precept. And thus by means of <HI>Your lawful Choice,</HI> He commits the Care of Your Souls to Your Spiritual Guides &amp; Rulers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HE does it also by</HI> Their Acceptance <HI>of Your lawful Choice.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR Election does not give Them a Power to rule or take Care of Your Souls: For They must <HI>Accept</HI> the Choice, or They have neither the Power over You nor the Care of You. Your choosing &amp; determining on Them to be Your Spi∣ritual Rulers does no more than give Them a <HI>Right</HI> of determining on You for Their peculiar Charge. It does not impose a Necessity on Them to be Your Ministers. They have the Liberty left Them to judge, Whether it may be more servicea∣ble to the Interest of CHRIST to accept or deny. When They accept; They are then Your Spiri∣tual Guides &amp; Rulers by <HI>Right,</HI> &amp; by <HI>Right</HI> &amp;
<PB N="17" REF="001996_0024_0FBA4DB7F2D6DCB0"/>
Title You are Their Charge. They have not yet the <HI>Power</HI> of Rule &amp; Care, till They are set apart, ordained &amp; devoted to this Sacred Office. By Your lawful Choice &amp; Their Acceptance They are <HI>intituled</HI> to the Investiture of the Care &amp; Government of You: But They have not the <HI>Pow∣er</HI> till They are ordained, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.1—3. <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.10, 22.</P>
<P>BY <HI>Accepting</HI> Your lawful Choice, They con∣sent to receive &amp; take the Charge of Your Souls, &amp; so CHRIST commits it to Them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THIS is therefore confer'd on Them by Their Solemn</HI> Ordination.</P>
<P>YOUR choosing Them &amp; Their accepting is such a Call of CHRIST, &amp; intitles Them in such a manner to Their Ordination; that if They be duely qualify'd, None may refuse it. By ordaining Them, the Power of taking Care of Your Souls is <HI>actually</HI> committed to Them: And They do <HI>actually</HI> receive it, &amp; lay Themselves under the most Solemn Vows &amp; Obligations to take Care of Them.

<P>BUT Their Power &amp; Office are derived from CHRIST: And it is He that really commits the Charge of Your Souls to Your ordained Ministers.

<P>THE <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> are the Fruits of His Pur∣chase &amp; Prophetical &amp; Kingly Office.

<P>IF We therefore look in the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> we shall see that He therein commits the Care of Your Souls to Your Ministers in a particular &amp; awful Man∣ner.

<P N="1">I. <HI>LET Us consider what does this</HI> Watching <HI>for Your Souls</HI> imply.</P>
<P N="1">§ 1. THE <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is translated by <HI>Ju∣nius</HI> &amp; <HI>Tremellius</HI> into a Word <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vigilant.</NOTE> that signifies to <HI>keep awake,</HI> to <HI>sit up</HI> in the <HI>Night,</HI> &amp; to be very <HI>vigilant</HI> &amp; <HI>careful.</HI> A Word of the same Deri∣vation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> is us'd by Our Apostle in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.5. Where He tells us of <HI>Himself</HI> &amp; <HI>Timothy,</HI> That They ap∣prov'd Themselves in all Things as the Ministers of GOD,—In Labours, in <HI>Watchings,</HI> &amp;c. And in <HI>Chap.</HI> 11.27. Are They Ministers? — I am more, —In Weariness, in Painfulness, in <HI>Watchings</HI> oft∣en,
<PB N="21" REF="001996_0028_0FBA4DC0AA4D9318"/>
&amp;c. As Instances of this, <HI>Estius</HI> cites to <HI>Acts</HI> 16.25. &amp; <HI>Chap.</HI> 20.7. Where We read of the Apostles Praying &amp; Preaching till <HI>Midnight</HI> for the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>IN a <HI>Literal</HI> Sense, Your Ministers are many times to keep awake &amp; watch &amp; study for your Souls Salvation, &amp; deny Themselves the Rest &amp; Ease that You enjoy. They must keep awake &amp; watch, says <HI>Pareus,</HI> while others are sleeping in Quiet. They are often watching &amp; praying for Your Souls in the Night, while You are neg∣lecting them, &amp; even allowing Yourselves in Sin.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Word is here of a <HI>Metapho∣rical</HI> Sense: And may be taken from <HI>Physitians</HI> &amp; <HI>Nurses,</HI> who sit up &amp; watch for the Sick, &amp; deny Themselves Sleep &amp; Rest for Their Relief &amp; Com∣fort. They stir up Themselves &amp; shake off Their natural Drowsiness, &amp; watch for every good or evil Symptom that appears in their Patients: They carefully observe every Circumstance &amp; Motion; They are attentive to all Their Complaints &amp; Wants, &amp; are ready to administer Medicines &amp; Cor∣dials to Them.</P>
<P>THE Ministers of CHRIST are not then to in∣dulge Themselves in Negligence or Ease: But attend on Their Charge with a wakeful &amp; lively Spirit. They have the Care of many Souls that are dying &amp; perishing, or drooping &amp; helpless, &amp; need Their Assistance. They must watch for all the dangerous or hopeful Signs that appear in Them. They must hearken to Their Com∣plaints, &amp; observe Their Wants, &amp; be continual∣ly ready to relieve &amp; comfort Them.</P>
<P>THUS Our <HI>Saviour</HI> calls Himself a <HI>Physitian,</HI>

Mat. 9.12<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 2 17. Luke 5.31.</NOTE>. And Our <HI>Apostle</HI> with <HI>Sylvanus</HI> &amp; <HI>Timothy,</HI> liken Themselves to tender &amp; careful <HI>Nurses,</HI> 1 Thes. 2.7.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. BUT <HI>Beza</HI> renders the Word in Our Text by Another <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Excubant.</NOTE> that signifies to <HI>lie out,</HI> to <HI>stand Sentry,</HI> to keep <HI>Watch &amp; Ward,</HI> or stand upon the <HI>Guard</HI> in a Time of Danger. In this Sense it alludes to <HI>Soldiers,</HI> who are appointed to watch both for the Preservation of Themselves &amp; the rest of the City or Army. Those especially that are <HI>Leaders</HI> or <HI>Captains,</HI> are to be continually apprehensive of Evils &amp; Enemies from every Quarter, &amp; to be looking out sharply for every first Appearance of Them. They must watch over Their Soldiers to see that They observe exact Order &amp; Discipline. And They must also be very attentive to Their State &amp; Wants, &amp; observe every Beginning of Mutiny, Complaint or Disturbance.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this the Word is used in <HI>Three</HI> other Places in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> &amp; in them all is join'd to the Exercise of <HI>Prayer</HI> in a Time of Danger. Thus Our Apostle prescribes it as a most important Duty to the <HI>Christian War∣riour,</HI> in <HI>Eph</HI> 6.18. And thus Our BLESSED SAVIOUR exhorts His Disciples to <HI>Take heed,</HI> Watch <HI>&amp; Pray; For They know not the Time when the Son of Man will come, Whether at Even, Mid∣night, or at the Cock-crowing, or early in the Morn∣ing,</HI> Mark. 13.33—e Luk. 21.36.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Church</HI> is called a <HI>City</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.22.</NOTE>, the <HI>Mem∣bers</HI> Fellow-<HI>Citizens</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>, &amp; the <HI>Ministers Watchmen</HI> in several Places of <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 52.8· &amp;c,</NOTE>. It seems to
<PB N="23" REF="001996_0030_0FBA4DED66F7B158"/>
be likened also to an <HI>Army</HI> with Banners, <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.4, 10. The <HI>Ministers</HI> of CHRIST are styled <HI>Sol∣diers</HI> by Our Apostle in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.25<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">And 2 Tim. 2.3, 4.</NOTE>. And in the preceeding Part of our Text, &amp; the <HI>Seventh</HI> &amp; <HI>Twenty-fourth Verses,</HI> He calls Them, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>i. e. Governours, Captains</HI> or <HI>Leaders,</HI> as We have ob∣serv'd the Word may be render'd.</P>
<P>THE Ministers of CHRIST are therefore dili∣gently to watch for the Societies &amp; Companies that are committed to their Care &amp; Government. They are to look &amp; see that You keep exactly to Order &amp; Discipline. They must observe Your Wants &amp; Temptations, &amp; every Beginning of Dissention &amp; Discord. They must expect &amp; nar∣rowly watch for Enemies on all sides, &amp; careful∣ly warn You of Them &amp; provide against Them; that They may not successfully assault or under∣mine You.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. BUT after all, I am apt to think, that the Word rather alludes to <HI>Shepherds,</HI> &amp; that Our Apostle had a particular Regard to <HI>Them</HI> in this excellent Allusion. Especially considering the following Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> more commonly signifies <HI>over</HI> than <HI>for,</HI> &amp; the Clause may rather therefore be render'd,—They watch <HI>over</HI> Your Souls, which is a <HI>Pastoral</HI> Phrase, or a Phrase that seems to be peculiar to <HI>Shepherds</HI>; as denoting that Simplicity, Care &amp; Tenderness which They usually manifest in watching over Their exposed &amp; innocent <HI>Flocks.</HI> They continually &amp; carefully survey them; to defend them from Destroyers, to keep them from wandering into Mischief, &amp; that not One of them may be missing or lost for want of looking after.</P>

We find Our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> accordingly committing the Care of some of His <HI>Sheep</HI> &amp; <HI>Lambs</HI> to this very Apostle, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 21, 15, 16, 17. And afterwards We have the same Apostle exhorting the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ders</HI> of the Church of the <HI>Lesser Asia</HI> to <HI>Feed the Flock of</HI> GOD <HI>among Them:</HI> [<HI>Taking the Oversight thereof</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>:] <HI>Not by Constraint, but willingly: Not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.1. &amp; 5.1, 2.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Watching for your Souls</HI> does therefore in∣timate <HI>That</HI> singular Care &amp; Sollicitude which is requir'd of the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Flocks of CHRIST <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT <HI>implies</HI> that <HI>Your Souls</HI> are exceeding Preci∣ous, &amp; in dreadful Hazard: That They are in Danger of devouring Enemies &amp; of going astray, &amp; have need to be carefully looked after: That Your <HI>Faithful Ministers</HI> are aware of this, &amp; ex∣treamly mov'd with the Sight &amp; Prospect: That They are full of Tender Compassion, Con∣cern &amp; Sollicitude about Your Eternal Welfare &amp; Salvation: That They intirely devote Themselves to take Care of Your Souls, &amp; mind nothing in the World if They can but save them: That They watch for You, as for Those They highly value, &amp;

<P>THIS &amp; a great deal more is <HI>imply'd</HI> in Our <HI>Watching for Your Souls.</HI> But We must now pro∣ceed to consider,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WHEREIN is this</HI> Watching <HI>for Them to be</HI> exercis'd <HI>or</HI> expressed.</P>
<P>A LEARNED Man <NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> observes, That the Word imports a Watchfulness, not only with the great∣est Design &amp; Care; but also with the greatest Diligence and Endeavour against Troubles, Dan∣gers &amp; Oppositions, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Design &amp; Work of Your Ministers is intirely to take Care of Your precious Souls, &amp; <HI>by all Means</HI> to preserve &amp; save Them.

<P>THE Great &amp; High &amp; Honourable, &amp; Those in Publick Stations are not above Our Watch: They are equally subject to the Dominion &amp; Laws of CHRIST, &amp; They need it as well as Any.

<P N="1">1. <HI>WE must carefully Observe the Spiritual</HI> State <HI>Your Souls are in.</HI></P>
<P>WE must Observe Your Knowledge, Ignorance &amp; Mistakes of the Things of GOD. The Ap∣pearances of the Life, Declensions &amp; Increase of Grace: And the Power &amp; Prevalence of Sin &amp; Lust. The Signs of Covetousness, Voluptuous∣ness &amp; Ambition: The Rise &amp; Growth of Vani∣ties, Follies, Errors, Enmities &amp; Contentions.
<PB N="29" REF="001996_0036_0FBA4E07FA77F0F8"/>

We are to observe Your Danger of losing Your lively Sense &amp; Concern of the Things of GOD: And that Presumption &amp; Despondency that are so threat∣ning &amp; destructive to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>WE must watch for Your Souls, says <HI>Pareus,</HI> That they may not be infused or seduc'd &amp; perish by Mistakes &amp; Erroneous Doctrines; But by a true &amp; upright Faith &amp; Life may obtain Eternal Happiness.

We must <HI>be with You at all Seasons, &amp; go from House to House,</HI> as Our Apostle did among the <HI>Ephesian</HI> Christians, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.18, 20. We must frequently Visit You<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 23.1, 2.</NOTE>, &amp; in Wis∣dom ask &amp; inform Ourselves of Your Affairs. We must endeavour to convince You by Our Looks, Behaviour, Words &amp; Conduct, That We are sincere &amp; hearty Lovers &amp; compassionate &amp; faithful Friends of Your Precious Souls, That You may be free &amp; open in revealing Your Ca∣ses to Us. We must upon all Occasions observe Your Carriages, Actions &amp; Discourses.

<P N="1">I. <HI>LET Us briefly consider,</HI> To Whom <HI>are Your Ministers to give an Account.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to GOD, as a Learned Man <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Estius.</HI></NOTE> expounds it: <HI>i. e.</HI> To GOD <HI>in the Person</HI> of Our LORD JESUS CHRIST; Answerable to what Our Apostle asserts
<PB N="37" REF="001996_0044_0FBA4E20A5774730"/>
in Rom. 14.10—12. <HI>We shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of</HI> CHRIST: <HI>For it is written, As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve, saith the</HI> LORD; <HI>Every Knee shall bow to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ &amp; every Tongue shall confess to</HI> GOD; <HI>So then Every One of Us shall give an Account of Himself to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this, Our Apostle speaks of Himself <HI>as a Minister of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>&amp; a Steward of the Mysteries of</HI> GOD; <HI>That it is the</HI> LORD <HI>who was to judge Him,</HI> 1 Cor. 4.1 —5. By the LORD is here plainly intended the LORD JESUS CHRIST, as Our Apostle gives Him this distin∣guishing Character in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.9—11. <HI>Wherefore</HI> GOD <HI>also hath highly exalted Him, &amp; given Him a Name which is above every Name: That at the Name of</HI> JESUS <HI>every Knee should bow, of Things in Heaven, &amp; Things in Earth, &amp; Things under the Earth; And that every Tongue should confess, that</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is</HI> LORD, <HI>to the Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>the</HI> FATHER.</P>
<P>HE is placed at the Head of all Rule &amp; Em∣pire, &amp; all Things both in Heaven &amp; Earth are put under His Feet, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.20—23. He tell Us <HI>Himself,</HI> That <HI>The</HI> FATHER <HI>judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the</HI> SON, Joh. 5.22—27. <HI>And He commanded Us to preach unto the People, &amp; to testifie that it is He which was ordain∣ed of</HI> GOD <HI>to be the Judge of Quick &amp; Dead,</HI> Acts 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.42. <HI>Wherefore, We labour, that whether present or absent We may be accepted of Him.

He bids Us ob∣serve &amp; remember That <HI>He is always with Us to the End of the World,</HI> Mat. 28.20. If He is always with Us; He always sees Us, &amp; is able to judge uprightly. While We are watching Others, He is also watching us all with infinitely greater In∣tenseness &amp; Care. <HI>His Eyes</HI> are therefore repre∣sented as <HI>A Flame of Fire</HI>: Dreadfully piercing &amp; jealous, to behold Our Hypocrisy, Negligence &amp; Infidelity, &amp; Your Unfruitfulness, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.14 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.18. &amp; 19.12.</NOTE>.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY must also</HI> Give up Their Account <HI>either with Joy or Grief.</HI></P>
<P>THERE will be a great deal of Difference in this Respect between the Giving up Their Ac∣count to CHRIST in the <HI>Present</HI> &amp; in the <HI>Future</HI> World.</P>
<P>IN this <HI>Present World</HI> They will ever have sufficient Cause both to rejoyce &amp; mourn either for Themselves or Others. Their Joys &amp; Sor∣rows will be interchangeable &amp; temporary, &amp; there will be a various &amp; continual Success<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of them. For the greater Part by far of their Pilgrimage here on Earth, They will have Occasion both to rejoyce &amp; grieve together. Their Joys &amp; Sor∣rows will be intermix'd &amp; mingled: And while They give up a good Account of <HI>Themselves</HI> with Comfort, They must many Times give a Sorrow∣ful Account of <HI>Those committed to Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> Of <HI>Some</HI> They will speak to CHRIST with an Holy Transport of Joy &amp; Gratitude, when for <HI>Ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers</HI> They must lament &amp; mourn.

<P>BUT this <HI>Intermixture</HI> &amp; various <HI>Succession</HI> of Joys &amp; Sorrows shall terminate with the present Life: And at the <HI>Hour of Death,</HI> there shall be an Eternal Separation made between them. The Ministers of CHRIST must then as well as Others enter into a State of pure &amp; endless Joy, or of unmingled &amp; endless Sorrow. They must awake &amp; arise from the Dust as the rest of Men, with perfect &amp; everlasting Rejoycing &amp; Ho∣nour; or with compleat &amp; endless Contempt &amp; Mourning. <HI>They that are Wise, shall shine as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Brightness of the Firmament: And They that have turned many to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever &amp; ever,</HI> Dan. 12.2.3.</P>
<P>IF We save Ourselves, Our Joy will be compleat &amp; full: And if You be saved with Us, &amp; by Our Indeavour; Your Salvation will be a vast Increase of Our Joy &amp; Honour <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE>.

<PB N="57" REF="001996_0064_0FBA4E76EB7CD000"/>
must watch in such a manner as it behoveth <HI>Those</HI> who must give Account to GOD, That They may do it with Joy, &amp; not with Grief. It is This which renders their Charge so exceeding dange∣rous &amp; fearful: And they had need to take the utmost Care how They attend unto it &amp; perform it. The Consideration &amp; Rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrance of it is of the last Importance to Them: And shou'd ever influence &amp; make Them extreamly careful in their Watching for You.</P>
<P>BUT the Time is so far pass'd away; That I mayn't inlarge on this important <HI>Proposition,</HI> nor insist on those <HI>Particulars</HI> that are needful to ex∣plain it. I may therefore only mention the <HI>Ge∣neral Heads,</HI> &amp; hasten on to a Close.</P>
<P><HI>This Watching</HI> — as Those <HI>that must give Account</HI>: That We may <HI>do it with Joy, &amp; not with Grief,</HI> Im∣plies <HI>These following Things.</HI></P>
<P>THAT We do continually remember, The Care of Your precious &amp; immortal Souls is committed to Us, &amp; shall be required of Us. That We ever keep in Mind a lively Apprehension of that im∣partial &amp; exact Account We are to give of Them &amp; of Our Indeavours for Them, &amp; the Tryal &amp; Eternal Decision that will follow on it. That We therefore watch for Every Soul committed to Us, without Exception, Omission, or Partial∣lity <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 5.21.</NOTE>. That We watch over Them with the ut∣most Caution, Circumspection, Concern &amp; Care; That not One may perish thro' Our Neglect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pareus.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT We do Every Thing We are able &amp; can devise for their Eternal Welfare &amp; Salvation.
<PB N="58" REF="001996_0065_0FBA4E77CCE74C88"/>
That We make the utmost Improvement of Our Powers &amp; Opportunities for the Security &amp; Ad∣vancement of them. That herein We continually labour with Zeal &amp; Resolution, &amp; without Discou∣ragement, Interruption or Remissness. That We persevere &amp; <HI>Be faithful unto Death,</HI> Rev. 2.10. And <HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p this Commandment without Spot, Unrebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, until the Appearing of Our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST; <HI>Which in His Times He shall shew, Who is the Blessed &amp; Only Potentate, the King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.14, 15.</P>
<P>FINALLY, That We watch as Those that are always ready to give up Our intire &amp; impartial Account to CHRIST: And as He has expresly warn'd Us in Luk. 12.35. That <HI>Our Loyns be gird∣ed about &amp; Our Lights burning, &amp; We Ourselves like to Men who wait for their Lord when He will return from the Wedding; That when He comes &amp; knocketh, We may open immediately: Blessed are those Servants whom the</HI> LORD <HI>when He comes shall find Watching.</HI></P>
<P>THUS have I indeavoured as comprehensive &amp; concise an <HI>Explication</HI> as I cou'd well contrive of Our <HI>Text &amp; Doctrine.</HI> I have said no more than I thought was needful to give You a full &amp; clear Interpretation of this most important Scripture. I have had no Time to insist on a great many Heads to <HI>Illustrate or Confirm</HI> them. The greater Part of my Discourse has therefore rather been an Enumeration of various Particulars which are included in the Ministerial Office. It wou'd take up a copious Volumn to clear a <HI>Twentieth</HI> Part of the Things deliver'd. I must indeavour to fill up my Life in the more evident Proof &amp; Explanati∣on of them.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P>OF it <HI>To Those</HI> whose Souls I am now ven∣turing to undertake the Watch &amp; Care of, &amp; in a great Measure to be Accountable for to CHRIST. And in this Address I shall not speak in <HI>My Own</HI> Name alone, but sometimes in the Name of <HI>Your Reverend Pastor</HI> &amp; <HI>My Dear Companion</HI> in the Mi∣nisterial Work.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>YOU see</HI> My Brethren, <HI>How exceeding</HI> Weigh∣ty, Difficult &amp; Hazardous <HI>is the Work We under∣take &amp; undergo for Your Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH, says <HI>Calvin,</HI> is the Ministerial Office; That it contains both the greatest Troubles, &amp; the greatest Dangers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Loc.</NOTE>. An Employment, says Another Learned Man <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pareus</HI> in Loc.</NOTE>, So full of <HI>Labour, Bur∣then</HI> &amp; awful <HI>Hazard</HI>; That it is a Wonder any shou'd seek it, who duely weigh the Peril of gi∣ving up Their Account to GOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HOW exceeding</HI> Weighty!</P>
<P>IT is Your Precious &amp; Immortal <HI>Souls</HI> that are committed to Our Care &amp; Charge! Oh how in∣supportably heavy is this Load &amp; Burthen! If it were not the Burthen &amp; Yoak of CHRIST; We cou'd never be brought to submit unto it, We cou'd never bear it. We find it to be Work enough, &amp; indeed more than We can perform aright, to take Care of <HI>Our Own</HI> Immortal Souls:
<PB N="60" REF="001996_0067_0FBA4E7B8F4E22F8"/>
And how then shall We take Care of <HI>Yours</HI>! We are in danger of del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding <HI>Ourselves</HI> in the Great Affairs of Our Salvation: And how then shall We undertake to lead <HI>You</HI> secure &amp; safe in the narrow Path of Eternal Life &amp; Happiness! But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HOW exceeding Hard &amp;</HI> Difficult <HI>is the Work</HI>!</P>
<P>HOW prone are We to be negligent &amp; careless of <HI>Our Own</HI> Souls: And how then shall We watch for <HI>Yours</HI>! What Difficulties must We be incum∣bred with from the Corruptions, Passions, Selfish∣ness, Wilfulness &amp; Pride of Men; &amp; the prevail∣ing Vanities &amp; evil Customs of this Declining Generation. How hard is it to Act against Our native Bashfulness &amp; Unwillingness of offending, &amp; to be Faithful to You! How exceeding Diffi∣cult, if not impossible, to watch over so many Souls, when We can hardly know Them: And if We do not know Them, They must needs be mise∣rably looked after!</P>
<P>WHAT need have We of great Degrees of Knowledge, Understanding, Wisdom &amp; Integrity! What great Degrees of Purity, Devotion &amp; Love &amp; Zeal for CHRIST: And of Courage, &amp; conti∣nual Tenderness of Conscience in His Work &amp; Service! What need of Humility, Meekness, Patience, Charity, &amp; Benignity of Temper! What need of perpetual Caution, Fear &amp; Circumspecti∣on &amp; painful Labour! In Fine, What need of every Grace, &amp; the lively, strong &amp; constant Ex∣ercise of them: And especially of Faith &amp; Hope in Things invisible, &amp; of most dear Compassion &amp; Love to You; As a perpetual Source &amp; Spring of Vigour, Resolution, Activity, Fidelity, &amp; unwea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Diligence!</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="61" REF="001996_0068_0FBA4E7D575E5878"/>3. <HI>HOW exceeding</HI> Hazardous <HI>&amp; Dreadful also is Our Imployment</HI>!</P>
<P>YOUR Souls are committed to Us by CHRIST Himself, &amp; They will also be required of Us. If One be lost thro' Our Neglect, We must answer for it. Oh, How can We think of this, &amp; not fear &amp; tremble! Our Sovereign <HI>Lord &amp; Judge</HI> will be exact &amp; strict at Our future Tryal, &amp; We must give up Our Account impartially &amp; intirely to Him. He is ever present with Us, &amp; watchful of Us: <HI>His Eyes behold, &amp; His Ey-lids try Us</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 11.4.</NOTE>: And He sees Our Sloth &amp; Negligence, &amp; will bring Them into Judgment.</P>
<P>IT is most awful to Consider, That in such a Number there is no Doubt but many will for ever Perish: And the dreadful Loss will be charged to Our Account, if We knowingly omit any Thing that is needful to be done for Your Salvation.</P>
<P>HOW Perillous &amp; Dreadful then is it, to be obliged to give an Account of <HI>You</HI>; When if We had not this Charge upon Us, We shou'd never be able to give an Account of <HI>Ourselves</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Estiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>YOU therefore see, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> How exceed∣ing <HI>Weighty, Difficult</HI> &amp; <HI>Hazardous</HI> is the Work We undertake &amp; undergo for Your Eternal Safety.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>YOU likewise see from Hence the Awfulness &amp;</HI> Solemnity <HI>of Our</HI> Ordinations.</P>
<P>THEY are the Actual Committing the Care of Your Souls unto Us by CHRIST Himself: The
<PB N="62" REF="001996_0069_0FBA4E86F5496F08"/>
Investing Us with the Power &amp; Office of Ruling &amp; Watching over You in His Room &amp; Stead, &amp; according to His Institutions: And the Bringing Us under the most Solemn Obligations to Attend &amp; Fulfil this Ministry. All the Ministerial Char∣ges of His Revealed Word are now laid &amp; bound upon Us: And Wo unto Us if We dont observe them!</P>
<P>CHRIST Himself in His Divine &amp; Invisible Na∣ture is really Present with Us: He is now in the Midst of Our Assembly: He sees the secret Senti∣ments of all Our Hearts, &amp; He either approves or is offended. He has provided &amp; appointed His Ministers to Represent Him in this Authoritative &amp; Sacred Work: He beholds &amp; authorizes His Institution: He confirms it &amp; efficaciously gives the Blessing.</P>
<P>BUT the HOLY GHOST is His active &amp; effectu∣al Agent in this great Affair. It is He that Works on all Our Souls, &amp; inlivens &amp; seals the Institu∣tion with His Powerful Influence. It is He that helps Us all in Our ardent Prayers &amp; Supplica∣tions, &amp; excites the lively Exercises of Our Spi∣ritual Desires &amp; Faith, for the Graces &amp; Gifts of CHRIST for Your Ministers in the Act of Ordi∣nation &amp; Afterwards. It is He that has influen∣ced &amp; over-rul'd, &amp; brought Us to this awful Juncture: And that now really &amp; effectually com∣municates &amp; derives Authority, &amp; commits the Care of Your Souls unto Us, By the Imposition of Hands &amp; Charges &amp; Prayers &amp; Blessings of the <HI>Elders</HI> of His Churches.</P>
<P>IT Must be This HOLY SPIRIT that must rest upon Us &amp; possess Us, &amp; reside &amp; work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; or We are fit for Nothing. It is <HI>He</HI> that
<PB N="63" REF="001996_0070_0FBA4E8B4B259788"/>
must assist &amp; inable Us, or We con do Nothing: It is <HI>He</HI> that must inliven &amp; succeed Our Work, or We work in Vain.</P>
<P>BUT I must leave <HI>My Partner</HI> Here, And</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>REFLECT a little on what</HI> I Myself <HI>am going in the Presence of</HI> CHRIST <HI>to do.</HI></P>
<P>AND suffer Me Here to confess my Sins, &amp; make My Vows to GOD, &amp; Glory in My Infirmi∣ties; that the Power &amp; Grace of CHRIST, if He pleases, may be manifest in Me.</P>
<P>IT is amazing, That so worthless &amp; vile a Life as Mine shou'd be preserved through so many Pe∣rils, &amp; restored to this most happy Land. I think never any One, for whom GOD has done so much in Soul &amp; Body, has abus'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Grace &amp; Patience as I have done. He has followed Me with a con∣tinual &amp; most peculiar Train of Kindness from my first Creation: And tho' Others are not sensible of My Wickedness; Yet never sure has any been so ungrateful &amp; contemptuous, that has known so much &amp; receiv'd so much, &amp; has had so many Gracious Influences &amp; Admonitions of His HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P>IT is most astonishing to Me, &amp;. I believe to the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> also; That after all My Provoking Sins, that CHRIST Himself Who has seen them with Resentment &amp; Detestation, &amp; now beholds My great Unfitness, thro' My wicked Sloth &amp; Neg∣ligence, for this Divine Imployment, shou'd bring Me under a Necessity of ingaging in it. My Know∣ledge is so small in the Holy Scriptures: My Heart so sinful, sordid &amp; impure, &amp; so little devoted to Him: My Views of CHRIST so faint &amp; mingled
<PB N="64" REF="001996_0071_0FBA4E8C1AE73500"/>
with so low a respect unto His Divine Person, &amp; so small a Regard to His Interest, Will &amp; Ho∣nour: And the Life of Grace, if I have any at all, so languid &amp; declined in Me; That I have a Thousand Times greater Reason than ever the <HI>Prophet</HI> had, to cry out with Dread &amp; Horror <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 6.5.</NOTE>, — <HI>Wo is M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for I am undone</HI>! —</P>
<P>I KNOW not what He designs to do: But <HI>This</HI> I know; That unless He pleases to purify My Heart, &amp; give Me a powerful &amp; active Faith, I shall never be able to bear the Burthens of My Charge, &amp; much less perform My Work with any Liveliness or Pleasure.</P>
<P>I DESIRE to abhor Myself before Him: To bewail &amp; mourn, &amp; repent from My Soul of all my Sins &amp; Follies: And to lye with shame &amp; low Abasement at the Feet of His infinite Grace &amp; Mercy. It is with <HI>Awe &amp; Trembling,</HI> that I en∣ter into this Sacred Work: Lest I shou'd prove Unfaithful, &amp; at length a <HI>Cast-away</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 9.27.</NOTE>, &amp; have been unhappily now preparing a most dreadful Wit∣ness against Myself. My Chief Encouragement is the Consideration of what He has promised, &amp; can easily do for Me; Together with His Own external Call of Providence, &amp; the present seem∣ing Necessity, &amp; the future Need of so Pious &amp; Numerous a People, that I believe are Dear unto Him.</P>
<P>IN an humble Sense of my great Unworthiness, &amp; Dependance on His HOLY SPIRIT to sanctify &amp; rest upon Me, &amp; His Gracious Presence with Me; I again Renew My Covenant, &amp; Devote My∣self intirely &amp; for ever to Him: I Particularly
<PB N="65" REF="001996_0072_0FBA4E8D9AD12C60"/>
give up Myself to Him in the <HI>Ministerial Work</HI>: And with a Mixture of Hope &amp; Trembling, I take the <HI>Oversight of this Flock</HI> of His, &amp; receive the Care of Your Souls at His Hands.</P>
<P>LET me now return with <HI>My Brother</HI> again, And,</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>OBSERVE from Hence, What need You have to take especial Care, that You do not</HI> Discourage <HI>or</HI> Grieve Us <HI>in Our Work.</HI></P>
<P>THE desperate Hazards We expose Ourselves unto are enough to make Us uneasy &amp; perplex Us: The Difficulties of Watching, to dishearten, &amp; the Weighty Care of so many Souls, to sink Us. We have no need to meet with other Discouragements &amp; Burthens from You of Our Charge. How hard will it be that <HI>You</HI> shou'd grieve &amp; trouble Us; While <HI>We</HI> are undergoing so burthensome &amp; dan∣gerous &amp; hard a Task for You <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dikson</HI></NOTE>! How unkind will it be for <HI>You</HI> to vex Us; While <HI>We</HI> are Studying &amp; Praying &amp; Watching for Your Eter∣nal Safety, &amp; Accountable for Your Miscarriage!</P>
<P>ALASS! You will also dearly find it what Our Apostle assures Us in the End of the Verse — <HI>Un∣profitable for You▪ i. e.</HI> says an excellent <HI>Divine</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otland</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dickson</HI> ex <HI>Pareo</HI>▪</NOTE>, If perchance any among You shou'd not care for the Troubles, Sorrows &amp; Griefs of Your <HI>Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI>; It will turn to Your Hurt. If the <HI>Ministers</HI> of CHRIST, <HI>says He,</HI> are forc'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o mourn for Your Fault; CHRIST will hear their Groan∣ings while They are employ'd in His Work; &amp;

<P N="5">V. <HI>YOU see what Reason there is of</HI> Doing all You can <HI>for Our</HI> Comfort, Incouragement <HI>&amp;</HI> Relief.</P>
<P>YOU shou'd be Teachable &amp; ready to Obey, says <HI>Calvin</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In Loc.</NOTE>; That what Your <HI>Ministers</HI> ought to do for You, They may do it freely, &amp; with a cheerful Mind.

<P><HI>BUT I must draw to a</HI> Close <HI>with humbly Desi∣ring</HI> These Things <HI>of You, which I may just but mention.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT You wou'd indulge &amp; nourish in You a <HI>dear Affection</HI> for Us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. 5.12, 13·</NOTE>; Which You will find of unspeakable Advantage to You in the Fruit of Our Ministrations.

<P N="5">5. THAT You wou'd continually <HI>Remember &amp; Pity</HI> Us under all Our heavy Burthens, &amp; not willingly add to the sinking Load; By raising Disturbances in the Church, or Reflecting on Us, or slighting Our Ministerial Power &amp; Care, or any way discouraging or hindering Us in the due Exercise &amp; Improvement of them.</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT You wou'd always give Us a free &amp; open <HI>Access to Your Hearts</HI> &amp; Consciences: And readily &amp; kindly receive the faithful Counsels &amp; Admonitions We have to give You.</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P>THAT It wou'd then rest upon Me, a &amp; make Me Purify'd &amp; Beautiful Temple, &amp; shew forth Its Glo∣ry &amp; the Glory of CHRIST, &amp; ravish every Power in Me with the Love &amp; Admiration of Him &amp; De∣votion towards Him.</P>

<P>Unto this <HI>Capital City</HI> of the Province, there belong <HI>Ten Assemblies</HI> of Christians, which carry on so Lovingly, and so Peaceably, and so Decently, and all the Offices of <HI>Good Neigh∣bourhood,</HI> are so admirably cultivated among them, as to give unto the Bigots of <HI>Uniformity</HI> a forcible rebuke of their Bi∣gotry, and a notable proof, how consistent a variety of Rites in <HI>Religion</HI> may be with the Tranquility of <HI>Humane Society</HI>: and unto the whole World, a Demonstration, that <HI>Persecuti∣on</HI> for <HI>Consciencious Dissents in Religion,</HI> is an <HI>Abomination of Desolation</HI>; a thing whereof all Wise and Just Men will say, <HI>Cursed be its Anger for it is fierce, and its wrath for it is cruel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Reader</HI> is desir'd to observe, That the following <HI>Discourse</HI> is published from the first and rough Draught of the Reverend <HI>Author,</HI> and wants his finishing Hand to have been put to it; Which Ad∣vantage if it might have had, it would doubtless have appeared more Correct in <HI>Style</HI> &amp; <HI>Diction,</HI> &amp; with <HI>Enlargements</HI> in some parts of it, which I suppose it had in the <HI>Delivery</HI> of it. But especially I am prone to think, <HI>He</HI> would not have let it go out of his hands without directing the Reader to the particular <HI>Pages</HI> of the <HI>Authors</HI> whom he names &amp; refers us to. Yet as it is, whoever attentively reads it, &amp; knew Mr. <HI>PEMBERTON,</HI> can't but discern evidently here his strong and masterly way of <HI>Speak∣ing</HI> or <HI>Writing,</HI> his close and nervous manner of <HI>Reasoning</HI> and <HI>Arguing,</HI> and that the <HI>Discourse</HI> is worthy of his known <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> and excellent <HI>Judgment.</HI> So that I hope I have done an Honour to my deceased <HI>Friend,</HI> as well as a Ser∣vice and Honour to my <HI>Country,</HI> in transcribing it for the Press, and shall please &amp; oblige many.</P>
<P>My <HI>Wish</HI> is, that we could recover, and that the <HI>Publick</HI> might enjoy more of the <HI>Valuable Discourses</HI> of this <HI>Great Man:</HI> But alas, he carry'd the mighty <HI>Stores and Treasures</HI> of his laborious Studies in his own vast Mind, and for the most part wrote only

Hints to himself, to be Enlarg'd on in the <HI>Pul∣pit,</HI> which he wonderfully perform'd. So that as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaks of the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Earth, we may say here, <HI>In the day that his breath went forth, and he return'd to his Earth, in that very day his Thoughts perish'd:</HI> Saving those few which he has left in Print, and more I trust graven on the Hearts of many by the finger of <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>May the <HI>DIVINE SPIRIT</HI> bless what is here publish'd for the <HI>Enlightning</HI> and <HI>Establishing</HI> many in the <HI>present Truth:</HI> And may the Spirit of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Meekness</HI> that breaths every where thro' the follow∣ing <HI>Argument</HI> and adorns it, rest upon all Christians in their <HI>Researches</HI> after Truth and <HI>Defences</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I desire also to add my thankful Acknowledge∣ment of the Divine Goodness, which has return'd Mr. <HI>PRINCE</HI> to us to stand up in and fill the place of the <HI>Deceased;</HI> at whose earnest desire and instant Motion it is that <HI>this Discourse</HI> now sees the light, and accompanies his own <HI>Ordination Sermon</HI> to the Press: And while he thankfully takes up this Skirt of the <HI>Mantle</HI> of his Ascended <HI>Predecessor,</HI> may he with a double Portion of his Spirit enter into his La∣bours; always bearing in mind those Words of our <HI>LORD JESUS, I must work the Works of Him that sent Me while it is day, the night cometh wherein no man can Work.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, To Prove that ORDINATION By the Hands of the <HI>Presbitery,</HI> Is Valid and Regular According to <HI>Divine Institution.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS <HI>Audience</HI> cannot but be Sen∣sible that the design of this <HI>So∣lemn Assembly</HI> is to Seperate <HI>One</HI> to the Service of GOD in the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Gospel of his dear SON, by Solemn Prayer, and the <HI>Imposition of the Hands of the Presbytery.</HI> And I cannot but apprehend it proper and Seasonable to preface this <HI>Solemnity</HI> with some brief Account of the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> of the present Sacred Action, and of the <HI>Grounds</HI> on which we apprehend that we regular∣ly according to Gospel Rule are attending on it.
<PB N="2" REF="001996_0088_0FBA4EC09F7CB310"/>
And this I shall endeavour to do with all due de∣ference to the <HI>Godly and Learned,</HI> who may see things in another light; and without offence to any, unless such as are for stretching or cutting all men to their own Measure. This Ac∣count I at present apprehend necessary, as we are <HI>Accountable</HI> peculiarly for such publick Actions to GOD and Man.</P>
<P>I shall proceed herein gradually, in these steps,</P>
<P N="1">I. It is not to be disputed but that <HI>Christ</HI> has ap∣pointed <HI>a standing Gospel Ministry</HI> in his Church, to continue to the Consummation of all things. It was not a Temporary Constitution, but a Standing Or∣dinance, that there should be in all Ages of the Church an order of men to represent his Person, publish his Laws, exhibit the Promises, and ad∣minister Seals and Censures. This seems evident to a Demonstration, from the Promise of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Presence</HI> to be with his Ministers to the End of the World, <HI>Math.</HI> 28.20. In that the <HI>Reason</HI> of such an Institution of Men to this Service will continue. Their <HI>work</HI> will: The <HI>Lords Supper</HI> is to be administer'd till Christ shall come: Christ's Church needs such Ministrations: for the <HI>Secu∣lum Spiritus Sancti,</HI> such a Dispensation of the <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> as shall supercede the Use of Ministry and Or∣dinances, is not to be expected till Christ shall come in the Clouds, when the <HI>Lamb</HI> himself shall be the Light and Glory. Agreeably we have the End and Duration of the Gospel Ministry stated, Eph. 4.12, 13. <HI>For the perfecting of the Saints, till we all come to the Unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, un∣to the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="001996_0089_0FBA4EC2763C6640"/>II. It is most evident that those who are to serve God in the Ministry of his Gospel, <HI>must be duely Authorized to discharge the Office of a Gospel Mini∣ster.</HI> This Honour no man must take to himself but they that are called. The <HI>Apostles</HI> Interroga∣tion implies a vehement Assertion; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. <HI>How can one preach unless he be sent?</HI> God has not left this Work of the Ministry in common, but within a Sacred Inclosure, which can't be broke over without the Efforts of a <HI>Corah</HI>-like Spirit.</P>
<P>Now We are to observe <HI>two</HI> things necessary in Ordinary cases to intitle any to the power of the Ministerial Office; <HI>viz. The Power it self,</HI> and the <HI>Investiture</HI> whereby they are regularly authori∣zed to the Exercise of that Ministerial power.</P>
<P><HI>These</HI> must be distinguish'd; for want of which confusion follows. The <HI>Power</HI> comes alone from the <HI>Head of the Church,</HI> by his Commission given in the Gospel to all Ministers. The <HI>Investiture</HI> is only requisite unto the regular Exercise of that power which is given by Christ's Commission. And the Distinction may be Illustrated by para∣lel Cases among men. Thus particularly the <HI>Mayor</HI> of a City, his Power is one thing, and his regular Introduction into the Exercise of it, ano∣ther. The people or <HI>Burgesses</HI> ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; the <HI>Recorder</HI> or Steward gives him his Oath; but none of these confer the power, but only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the particu∣lar Person who receives his power from the <HI>Prince</HI> alone, by the <HI>Charter</HI> of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce.</P>
<P>So in the Case before us, — The whole pow∣er of a Gospel Minister is from <HI>Christ</HI>: for that Charter in the Gospel in which he institutes such an Order of men states their Work, and qualifica∣tions, and appoints what power shall belong to
<PB N="4" REF="001996_0090_0FBA4EC4D63F8A98"/>
their Office. And it is not in the power of any men to institute a new Office. They can't alter their Work, nor require other Qualifications than what Christ has stated: for that wou'd be to encroach upon the Authority and Governing Wisdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> the great Lawgiver of the Church.</P>
<P>And hence it follows, that it is not the <HI>Intenti∣on of the Ordainers</HI> that can determine what pow∣er a Gospel Minister is invested with. When he is introduced into the Office, he has all the pow∣ers that by the Gospel belongs to that Office. For the Minister is not <HI>of</HI> Men; tho' <HI>by</HI> Men; as those that invest regularly with that Authority.</P>
<P>Now the Investiture is by Persons authoriz'd by Christ hereto; whose Business only is <HI>designa∣re personam,</HI> to signify that the Person offering himself to the Ministry has Gospel qualifications for it, and being willing to Dedicate himself to it, and having Opportunity for the exercise of it, is Commissioned by Christ, approved as such, charged and commended to the Grace of God. They declare according to the Grace of the Gos∣spel, it is the Will of Christ the great Lawgiver of the Church, that the Person Ordained should officiate in the Sacred Function, and be under the solemn Bonds and Obligations, &amp; endowed with all the Priviledges and Power that belong to the Office. The Person thus qualified has a Right <HI>be∣fore</HI>: A right to be admitted, — and the Investi∣ture can't be deny'd him. It is not at the plea∣sure of men to deny it.</P>
<P>This Investiture is received in <HI>Ordination,</HI> per∣formed according to Scripture precept and prece∣dent. And no man, how qualified soever for the Work, can regularly exercise this right &amp; power
<PB N="5" REF="001996_0091_0FBA4EC5E298CBD8"/>
in ordinary Cases (I meddle not with Cases of Necessity) till he is regularly Introduced into the Ministry and Invested. Now according to Gospel Order a Minister receives his Investiture by being <HI>separated</HI> to this Work by the Imposition of Hands and solemn Prayer, by which he is com∣mended to the Grace of God: Which <HI>Separation</HI> by the approved Ceremony is to be performed regularly only by such as Christ has given a right and power thus to separate and ordain to the Mi∣nisterial Office.</P>
<P>Here therefore these <HI>three</HI> things are necessary,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Solemn Prayer,</HI> by which the Presence of God with them, and his Acceptance of the Or∣dained, is implored. So we find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar∣nabas</HI> were recommended to the Grace of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.2.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> which is a <HI>Sacred Cere∣mony</HI> used in the setting a Person apart for the Discharge of a Sacred Office. This Ceremony we find used in Scripture on various Occasions. 1. <HI>As a Rite of Benediction.</HI> So <HI>Jacob</HI> used it when he blessed <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh.</HI> And so our <HI>Saviour</HI> on the Children when he blessed them. Sometimes in <HI>Conferring Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Sometimes for working, <HI>Miraculous Cures.</HI> But chiefly as a <HI>Rite of Consecration,</HI> whereby a person was dedicated to the Exercise of a Function, which immediately related to the Service of God. So <HI>Moses</HI> laid his hands on <HI>Joshua</HI> before the whole Congregation, and gave him a Charge, <HI>Numb.</HI> 27.23. So the <HI>Apostles</HI> used it in Ordaining Deacons, <HI>Acts</HI> 6.6. So <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> had hands laid on them, when separated

to the Work, to which God had called them. And so <HI>Timothy</HI> was separated, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> was not borrowed from the Ceremonies of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> or <HI>Temple</HI>; for the <HI>Priests</HI> were not consecrated by that Ceremony; but from the <HI>Synag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e,</HI> where their <HI>Doctors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> were set apart to their Work by Imposition of Hands. And there is an admirable Conformity between the <HI>Synagogue,</HI> and the Constitution of <HI>Christian Churches</HI>; as may be seen in <HI>Blondel, Vitringa,</HI> Dr. <HI>Lightfoot, Stillingfleet,</HI> and <HI>Basnage.</HI> However this Ceremony is now Introduced into the Christi∣an Church, and it is requisite in the Ordinary Se∣paration of a Person to the Work of the Ministry, and may not be despised or neglected without Sin. And hence we have <HI>Gospel Examples</HI> of its Use, and the <HI>whole</HI> of Ordination is sometimes expressed by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. So 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.22. <HI>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third</HI> thing requisite in an Orderly Se∣paration to the Ministry is, <HI>That this Investiture be made by those that have Authority from Christ to Ordain.</HI> Which Power of Ordination must come from Christ. And such as have not a Right in∣herent in their Office to Ordain, may not presume to do it. For as it is Christ's Will manifested that tells Us who shall be Ordained, so who shall have power to Ordain. This is therefore necessary to a regular Investiture in the Ministerial Office, that it be performed by such as have been delegated by <HI>Christ</HI> to this Work.</P>
<P>Now here the <HI>Great Question</HI> is, Who these are? And this will be consider'd under the next <HI>Assertion,</HI> to which we pass,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="001996_0093_0FBA4ECAAD96BEF0"/>III. That we cannot but Apprehend that ac∣cording to the Will of Christ, <HI>Gospel Presbyters or Elders, the Ordinary standing Ministry of the Gospel, who have Power to preach and dispence the Sacra∣ments, have power to Ordain, and admit Persons sui∣tably qualified and called into the Ministerial Office.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Grounds</HI> on which we build this <HI>As∣sertion</HI> are, — That we are satisfied that we have <HI>Scripture light</HI> to direct Ordinary Ministers in Or∣daining — That we have nothing in Primitive or later <HI>Antiquity</HI> but what may be reconciled here∣to, and much to confirm this Practice, — That there are no <HI>Pleas</HI> we can find against it which ap∣pear of sufficient force to invalidate it — And that there will certainly great <HI>Inconveniences</HI> and <HI>Mischiefs</HI> to the Church of God follow from a denyal of this power to Ordinary Presbyters.</P>
<P>Something I shall offer to each of <HI>these,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We are satisfied that by Scripture light the Or∣dinary Ministers or Presbyters have power to invest others with Ministerial Authority.</HI> And from <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> we have such <HI>Reasons</HI> as these to confirm our Assertion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Presbyters</HI> or the <HI>Ordinary Ministers</HI> of the Gospel appear to have this Power, <HI>in that the Com∣mission of Christ, by which any that are supposed of a Superior Order Degree or Character do ordain, doth certainly belong to them.</HI></P>
<P>They that have power to ordain must have it from <HI>Christ,</HI> by his Commission. Where now shall we find this <HI>Commission?</HI> We must look to the <HI>Time after Christs Resurrection</HI>; for before there was no <HI>Officers</HI> appointed, nor any Christian <HI>Chur∣ches</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001996_0094_0FBA4ECEC2204FC0"/>
gathered. Now there are <HI>two Places</HI> which are pleaded to contain this power of Ordination, not expresly but implicitly. John 20.21, 23. <HI>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I You: Whose soever Sins ye remit, they are remitted to them.</HI> The other is, Math. 28.19, 20. <HI>Go t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach all Nati∣ons, baptising them,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o I am with you always, even unto the End of the World,</HI> Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Now <HI>these</HI> belong equally to Presbyters or Gospel Mi∣nisters. It is by this they <HI>Baptise, Preach,</HI> &amp;c. and by these the <HI>Opponents</HI> to our Assertion do assert <HI>the power of Presbyters to remit and retain Sins.</HI> Now if the <HI>Commission</HI> belongs to 'em it must be∣long to 'em in its full power, unless Christ has li∣mited them. And this Limitation we demand. If Christ hath not limited, none else have power to limit their Comission. Either therefore they have by this Commission no power to <HI>Baptise</HI> and administer the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> or they have power to <HI>Ordain.</HI> For the power of an Office must be taken from the Commission which impowers to the Discharge of it.</P>
<P>And this is owned by Several of a great Cha∣racter and name in the <HI>Establish'd Church</HI> of our Nation. So Dr. <HI>Forbes</HI> in his Discourse of <HI>Epis∣copa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> says, that Presbyters have the same power to Ordain by Divine Right, as to preach and bap∣tise. And Dr. <HI>Charlton</HI> in his Treatise of Juris∣diction says, The power of Order is given alike by Christ to all Bishops and Priests in their Con∣secration. So Dr. <HI>Field</HI> of the Church. And it was a Celebrated Saying of Dr. <HI>Usher,</HI> that <HI>Ordi∣nis est Ordinare.</HI> Presbyters therefore having the power of Order, have the power of Ordination.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001996_0095_0FBA4ED38F1D52E0"/>2. A second Reason is, <HI>Because we cannot find in Scripture the Institution of any standing Officer in the Church of a Superior Degree or Order to that of Elders, or Ministers of a particular Flock.</HI></P>
<P>We read indeed of <HI>Apostles, Evangelists, Pro∣phets</HI>; but these were Extraordinary Offices, en∣dowed with extraordinary powers, and had an extraordinary Call. But these ceased with the extraordinary Circumstances of the Church of God, which then called for them.</P>
<P><HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> do in Scripture evident∣ly appear the same. Were <HI>Bishops</HI> of a Superior degree or Office we must surely discover it by distinct <HI>Names</HI> or by distinct <HI>Qualifications</HI> re∣quir'd of them, or by different <HI>Work</HI> assign'd them; by a different <HI>Commission</HI> given them, or by differ∣ent Ordination and Consecration. But we find nothing of this upon <HI>Scripture</HI> Record. The same Office and Officers are promiscuously styled <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Elders,</HI> So <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. The Elders of <HI>Ephesus</HI> are termed <HI>Bishops: Take heed to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers: i e.</HI> Bishops, in the <HI>Original.</HI> So the Elders of <HI>Philippi</HI> are called <HI>Bishops,</HI> Philip. 1.1. Now <HI>these</HI> must be <HI>Elders</HI> and not <HI>Bishops,</HI> because there could not be more than <HI>One</HI> Bishop in a Church according to the Scheme of our <HI>Opponents.</HI> Moreover, The same qualifications are required: See <HI>Titus</HI> 1.5—9. the same Work is assign'd to them: the <HI>Elders</HI> are to take the Oversight of the Flock and to do the Work of a Bishop: 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.1, 2. <HI>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, — feed ye the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Oversight thereof, — not as Lords over God's He∣ritage, but being Ensamples to the Flock.</HI> The
<PB N="10" REF="001996_0096_0FBA4ED4CFF90510"/>
word is <HI>Episcopountes.</HI> Again, We find no diffe∣rence in their Commission, Consecration or Ordina∣tion. We have a Directory for the Ordination of <HI>Elders in every Church, Tit.</HI> 1.5. But none for the Consecration of <HI>Bishops</HI> to a Superior Office. Nay we want a <HI>Scripture Canon</HI> for any ordinary standing Officer to rule <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And we have no shadow of a Command to <HI>them</HI> to subject themselves to any standing Superior Degree or Order of Officers.</P>
<P>So that we can't but conclude <HI>Scripture Bishops and Elders</HI> to be of the <HI>same</HI> Order and Degree in the Church; and that either there is no <HI>Elder</HI> as a Minister of a particular Flock, or no <HI>Bishop</HI> as Superior to an Elder. And this made Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> say, "There were no <HI>Presbyters</HI> of an Inferior Order instituted by the <HI>Apostles</HI>: and Dr. <HI>Stilling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet</HI> on the Contrary, "That there were no <HI>Bishops</HI> during the <HI>Apostles</HI> life. And a Supe∣rior Officer without an Inferior under him, or an Inferior without a Superior over him, comes to one and the same. And if there be no Officer Superior to Ministers, then Ministers have <HI>the Authority to Ordain,</HI> if there be <HI>any.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another Reason is, <HI>Because they that have Authority to exercise the power of the Keys, and are consequently Rulers in God's Houshold, have the pow∣er of Ordaining Ministers.</HI> But the Ordinary Mi∣nisters of the Gospel have the <HI>Keys</HI> committed to them. It is universally acknowledged, they have the Key of <HI>Doctrine</HI>; but how, or by what Rule, can <HI>that</HI> be separated from the Key of <HI>Juris∣diction.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>full</HI> power of the <HI>Keys</HI> was committed to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and must be transmitted to all <HI>Gospel
<PB N="11" REF="001996_0097_0FBA4ED71A7DD088"/>
Elders.</HI> Unless some <HI>Divine Canon</HI> may be pro∣duced to divide them.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Rulers</HI> in the Church of Christ: <HI>A power to bind and loose: Qualifications for Govern∣ment</HI> are required: the <HI>feeding the flock</HI> compre∣hends Government in it: <HI>Submission</HI> is required to them that <HI>rule,</HI> Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for Your Souls, as they that must give Ac∣count.</HI> And we can find no <HI>Elders</HI> but what have the power of <HI>Rule.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We can't but apprehend their power of Ordina∣tion from Scripture Precedents.</HI> I shall name <HI>two</HI> famous Instances. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were set a∣part by the hands of <HI>Ordinary Elders: Acts</HI> 13.1, 2, 3. So was <HI>Timothy</HI> ordained by the Imposition of the <HI>Hands of the Presbytery</HI>: 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. And what was then <HI>valid</HI> is now. So that if we err, it is safest erring with such <HI>Guides.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, If <HI>Scripture</HI> be the <HI>Rule</HI> then we can't but safely conclude for the <HI>Right</HI> of Pres∣byters, or Ordinary Gospel Ministers, to Ordain Others into that holy Function without Intrusion, or Encroachment upon the Prerogative of any other Degree or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der</HI> of men; or any breach up∣on <HI>any Canon truly Divine or Apostolical.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We find much in Antiquity, Primitive and la∣ter, that favours this power of Presbyters; and no∣thing but what may be reconciled to it.</HI> Tho' our Cause is not to stand at this <HI>Tribunal</HI>: We have a more <HI>sure Rule</HI> to judge by. Yet <HI>here</HI> we meet with what confirms our Assertion. <HI>Clemens Ro∣manus and Polycarp</HI> mention only <HI>two</HI> Orders of Officers as of Divine Institution; <HI>viz.</HI> Bishops or
<PB N="12" REF="001996_0098_0FBA4ED989154D58"/>
Elders, and Deacons. <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Hil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> are on our side by the consent of all. And where he speaks of Ordination as the peculiar of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> he speaks what was according to Constitution Ecclesiastical. And we have Evidence that in <HI>Alexandria</HI> for two hundred Years only <HI>Presbyters</HI> appointed any unto the Sacred Office.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that <HI>Early</HI> there was a <HI>distinction</HI> between Bishops and Presbyters. But this at first was not greater than between a <HI>Moderator</HI> of a <HI>Council</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Presbyte∣ry</HI> of which it is Constituted.</P>
<P><HI>Ignatius</HI> his Authority doth not move us, be∣cause <HI>his Bishop</HI> was certainly but a <HI>Pastor of a single Congregation</HI>; and <HI>his Presbyters</HI> not the Ministers that had the care of different Flocks, but <HI>Assistants</HI> to the Bishop in one and the same Flock▪ In that also he asserts "That his Presby∣ters did <HI>succeed into the Bench of the Apostles,</HI> and as such are to be regarded and submitted to. Not to say, how much reason we have to question whether <HI>his Epistles</HI> are genuine.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Superior power of Bishops was fixed by <HI>Councils,</HI> and by common Agreement. We find sufficient in <HI>Canonists, Councils and School∣men</HI> to give us to understand, that <HI>this Limitation</HI> of the Power of Presbyters was not owing to <HI>Di∣vine Institution,</HI> but to <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitutions:</HI> with what warrant I leave.</P>
<P>If we come to the time of the <HI>Reformation</HI> we find it as clear as the Light <HI>that the Reformers were for an inherent power in Elders to Ordain.</HI> The Judgment of the <HI>forreign Churches</HI> of the Re∣formed is evident from the <HI>Harmony of their Con∣fessions,</HI> which assert an <HI>Equality</HI> in all Gospel Mi∣nisters.
<PB N="13" REF="001996_0099_0FBA4EEEC3D39570"/>
The sense of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Churches of the <HI>German Empire</HI> may be well known from those <HI>Articles</HI> called the <HI>Smalcaldic</HI>; in which the Equality of Ordaining power by Divine right is asserted to belong to Presbyters; which was sub∣scribed by <HI>three Electors, Forty five Noblemen,</HI> the <HI>Consuls</HI> and <HI>Senators</HI> of <HI>Thirty five Cities,</HI> and a vast Number of <HI>Divines.</HI> At Home <HI>in our Nation,</HI> the Reformers asserted the same Equa∣lity of power by Divine right. We have Dr. <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Judgment for it given by Dr. <HI>Stilling∣fleet</HI>: and in the Book called <HI>the Erudition of the Christian Man,</HI> which was drawn up by the <HI>Body of the Clergy,</HI> approved by <HI>both Houses of Parlia∣ment,</HI> and publish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <HI>Kings</HI> Command, it is asserted That <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> by God's Law are one and the same; and that the power of <HI>Or∣dination</HI> belongs Equally to both. I shall only add, that when the three <HI>Scottish Bishops</HI> came to be <HI>Consecrated</HI> in the days of <HI>Arch-Bishop Ban∣croft,</HI> the Motion for their being <HI>first Ordained Priests,</HI> because they had never received <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordination, was over-rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for this Reason, <HI>because Priests had the power of Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>We stand therefore with the <HI>Reformed,</HI> in assert∣ing our own <HI>Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining Power.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>We cannot see sufficient Strength in any Pleas alledged against Ordination by Presbyters, without a Superior Officer.</HI></P>
<P>It is pleaded that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were subbor∣dinated to the <HI>Apostles</HI>; and that <HI>Bishops</HI> succeed to the Apostles, and <HI>Presbyters</HI> to the Seventy. But this appears to us only asserted, not proved; nor as we think can be; for the <HI>Apostles</HI> were Ex∣traordinary
<PB N="14" REF="001996_0100_0FBA4EF58C09B210"/>
Officers, unfixed, and <HI>had no Successors,</HI> as is made good by Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> in his Discourse of the <HI>Popes Supremacy.</HI> Nor can we find the <HI>Seventy</HI> subjected to them; but rather that they had the same Commission: Their <HI>Mission</HI> also seems but for a season, and we hear no more of them after <HI>Christs</HI> Resurrection and Ascention and therefore they have no <HI>Successors.</HI></P>
<P>It is pleaded that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> had as <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> a Superiority over <HI>Presbyters.</HI> But we find them no where styled so in the Word of God; and the Superiority they had was as they were Ex∣traordinary Officers, and not as fixed Bishops. For we are assured that they did not <HI>fix</HI> their A∣bode in the <HI>Places</HI> where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said to be Bi∣shops. We find them <HI>both</HI> in other <HI>Cities,</HI> and carrying on the some Work. And we find several Bishops of <HI>Ephesus</HI> together, while <HI>Timothy</HI> was alive, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. And tho' <HI>Timothy in Ephe∣sus</HI> and <HI>Titus in Crete</HI> had the Power of <HI>Ordinati∣on,</HI> yet there appears nothing to restrain the Stated Elders of those Places from the Exercise of the like power.</P>
<P>It is pleaded, <HI>that the Bishops that ordained Eld∣ers did not commit to them ordaining Power.</HI> But we see no weight in this: If they were Ordained <HI>to the Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> of Gospel Ministers, and the power of that Office <HI>is not to be determined by the Inten∣tion of the Ordainers,</HI> but by the Powers granted by <HI>Christ</HI> unto such an Office.</P>
<P>It is pleaded, That <HI>the want of a lineal Succession in a direct line from the Apostles,</HI> doth wholly sub∣vert the power of Subordinate Presbyters to Or∣dain. But we cannot be moved by this; <HI>partly</HI> because we believe there is <HI>no necessity</HI> of such a
<PB N="15" REF="001996_0101_0FBA4EFA83B06D70"/>
Succession; <HI>partly</HI> because we are satisfied that the Ordination of <HI>no one Minister</HI> on Earth can be thus made evident; <HI>and</HI> because the same way that <HI>others</HI> make good that <HI>they themselves</HI> are in the Line of Succession, Presbyters may prove that they are equally in it. But we dare not put the <HI>Regularity</HI> and much less the <HI>Validity</HI> of our <HI>Mini∣stry</HI> upon such an uncertain foundation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We cannot but apprehend <HI>manifest Incon∣veniences,</HI> nay <HI>Mischiefs</HI> to the Church of God, by denying this power of Ordination to all true Mi∣nisters of the Gospel. I shall mention <HI>two.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. If we deny that power, <HI>we must conclude that the main part of the Churches of the Reformation have no regular or Lawful Ministers, nor regular Ordinances,</HI> And we cannot pass a Judgement so rash and severe.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then also we must conclude, <HI>that when Chur∣ches are overun with the greatest Heresies and Idola∣try there can be no Reformation unless the Ministers of an Episcopal Character lead therein.</HI> For if they reform without them, they will lose all regular power to propogate the Ministerial Order. And this is a Thought so big with <HI>shocking Conclusions</HI> that we can on no terms be reconciled to it.</P>
<P>Upon all these Accounts we are satisfied, <HI>that Ordination by the Hands of the Presbytery is valid and regular according to Divine Institution</HI>: And we trust that we have found the <HI>Presence of God with us</HI> herein, and with <HI>our Ministers</HI> thus Separated to the service of the Gospel: And therefore we hope at this time to enjoy his Presence and Bles∣sing in the <HI>present Solemnity,</HI> in which we shall now engage in his Name and Fear.</P>
