<HEAD>TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some who would be estemed <HI>the Wits</HI> of the world, that <HI>Ridicule</HI> those as <HI>Superstitious</HI> and Weak persons, which look upon Dreadful Tempests as <HI>Predromous</HI> of o∣ther Judgments. Nevertheless, The most Learned and Judicious Writers, not only of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but amongst <HI>Christians</HI> have Embraced such a Per∣swasion; their Sentiments therein be∣ing Confirmed by the Experience of many Ages. It may be, it will not be alto∣gether Unedifying, for me on this occa∣sion to mention some few Instances of unusual Storms, which have been the forerunners of greater Calamities im∣mediately following them. That such tremendous Dispensations of Providence

have sometimes been <HI>Prognosticks</HI> of a <HI>Storm of Persecution</HI> coming on the Church of God, there wants not Examples to induce us to believe. <HI>A. D.</HI> 375 There was a prodigious Tempest at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> which pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d fatal to more than a few persons. The next Year the <HI>Arian</HI> Persecution under the Emperour <HI>Valen∣tinian</HI> was a terrible Judgment. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1620. There was a fearful Tempest throughout <HI>Switzerland,</HI> immediately up∣on which horrendous Popish Cruelties ensued. But it has more often been ob∣served, that such Tempests have been the forerunners of most bloody Wars, and popular Commotions. I know not whether any History does mention a more dismal Storm than that which hapned in the Low Countries, in the Year 1421 causing a Flood which overwhelmed Seventy Six Villages, and destroyed a∣bove an Hundred Thousand Persons; which J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicious and Learned men have judged to be <HI>Portentous</HI> of the dreadful Desolations which soon after that, were made in <HI>Europe</HI> by the Sword and Wars raging in many Nations. A prodigi∣ous Tempest in <HI>Millain A. D.</HI> 1510. pre∣ceded the coming of the <HI>French</HI> into

<HI>Italy,</HI> with Fire and Sword. An unusual Tempest throughout <HI>Germany</HI> was follow∣ed with the <HI>Rustic Sedition,</HI> attended with horrible Slaughters; many Thou∣sands having in a few Dayes time their Throats cut, as if they had not been Men, but Beasts.</P>
<P>These Examples with many more, too long with the Circumstances of them to be here recited, should awaken the world out of its <HI>Lethargy</HI>: which would be the way to avert the <HI>Omen</HI> of such Por∣tentous Providences. For we know that when the most high God sees cause to menace Nations, whether by His Word, or by His awful Works, these Threatnings are Conditional. <HI>When He speaks con∣cerning a Nation to destroy it, if that Na∣tion against whom He has Pronounced turn from their Evils, He will Repent of the E∣vil that He thought to do unto them.</HI> However it shall be, Certain it is, that <HI>the Voice of God</HI> who sometimes spoke to <HI>Job</HI> out of <HI>the Whirlwind</HI> is speaking to the Nations in that <HI>Stormy Wind</HI> which has <HI>Fulfilled His Word,</HI> in a manner most terrible.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more Dangerous than for <HI>Mortals</HI> to Contemn dreadful Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dences,

and in particular, <HI>Dreadful Tem∣pests.</HI> A worthy <HI>Helvetian</HI> Divine, (<HI>Bart. Anhorn.</HI>) giveth us an account of an aw∣ful Judgment, which lately befel a very impious man in <HI>Suevia,</HI> where they are often visited with terrible Thunders. When some were gathering in their Corn, a Thunder Storm coming upon them, most of the Company hastened into their Houses: only one Atheistical man remained in his Cart. A Clap of Thun∣der breaking close by him without doing him any hurt, the Prodigious Heaven daring Atheist uttered such words as these, <HI>Charge again for thou hast not hit me</HI>! Immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y a second Thunder struck him Dead in a moment. The same Author speaks of another, who was wont profanely to Swear by the Thun∣der and Lightning. This man in the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1682. said, he had some∣thing else to do than to Dy as yet: he was resolved to dispatch some business in the Countrey first. The next day after he had thus irreligiously Expressed himself, the Lightning by which he was wont to Swear, Killed him before he could be at leasure to Dy, or could finish his <HI>Rural Affairs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001183_0006_0FB0FF58CD120608"/>Some have said, that the <HI>Demon</HI> spoke True, when he affirmed that the best Verse in <HI>Virgil</HI> was; <Q>Discite justitiam monitiet non temnere Divos.</Q></P>
<P>We are sure, that the Royal Psalmist was Divinely inspired when he said, <HI>Be∣cause they regard not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of His Hands, He shall de∣stroy them, and not build them up.</HI></P>
<P>The dismal Tempest which has occa∣sioned the <HI>subsequent Discourses,</HI> did not reach us in <HI>America.</HI> Nevertheless, the next day, (viz. <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m.</HI> 28<HI>th.</HI> 1703.) there was with us a more than ordinary <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y Storm,</HI> so as that several Towns in the Countrey could not attend the Pub∣lick Worship of God on that <HI>Lords Day.</HI> And some among us in <HI>New-England,</HI> felt the sad Effects of that in <HI>England</HI>: For one of our Ships then at Anchor in the Downs, with several of our Neighbours, Perished in that doleful Night. On which account, there is a <HI>Voice of God</HI> therein speaking to us also. We must be Deaf indeed, if such loud Calls, if such astonishing Providences do not at

Especially, Considering that the last Month, and the last Day of it, (viz. <HI>Feb.</HI> 29<HI>th.</HI>) of the Year past, ended with a Tragical Storm of another Nature, when <HI>Barbarous Indians,</HI> animated by Bloody <HI>French-men,</HI> fell upon the Town of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> Killing or carrying into a miserable Captivity, one-half of the Inhabitants; amongst whom was the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church there, whose Wife and one of his Children were cruelly Murdered; Himself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (a Faithful Minister of God) with Four of his Chil∣dren then made <HI>Captives</HI> by the Enemy.

<P>Stormy Wind fulfilling His Word.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Penman of this Psalm is not mentioned; but we know it was an Inspired man of God that wrote it, who therein calls upon all Creatures to give Glory unto God. Man was the last Creature that was made, and therefore he is in the last place spoken unto. The Psal∣mist begin, with the Inhabitants of the Third and Highest Heavens; Namely, the Holy Angels, <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2, and incites them to Praise the Lord. Not that they need any Excitation thereunto; but when he calls upon them, it implies, that to
<PB N="10" REF="001183_0009_0FB0FF5DCA98D460"/>
Praise God is as their Practice, so their Duty. <HI>Praise ye the Lord from the Hea∣vens: Praise Him in the Heights. Praise ye Him all His Angels; Praise ye Him all His Hosts.</HI> Then the Psalmist descends unto the Starry Heavens, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. <HI>Praise ye Him, Sun and Moon; Praise Him all ye Stars of Light.</HI> Which words are a <HI>Po∣etical Rapture.</HI> Those Creatures are not able to Praise God after such a manner as Men may do. But in speaking to them, the Psalmist reflects upon the Idolatry of the Nations in the world, who were won't to Worship the Hosts of Heaven. Whereas if the Stars had Rational Souls, and were able to speak, they were bound to Praise God that made them. Then the Psalmist descends, (in <HI>ver.</HI> 4.) to the Lowest Heavens, <HI>viz.</HI> the Air. He speaks to the <HI>Waters above the Heavens,</HI> viz. <HI>the Clouds</HI> which are above the Air, that they should Praise the Lord. Lastly, He de∣scends to the Earth and Sea, and calls upon all Creatures therein that they should Praise the Lord. In the former part of this Verse, he speaks to the <HI>Fire and the Hail, the Snow and Vapour.</HI> That is to say, both hot and cold Vapours that they should Praise the Lord. And still
<PB N="11" REF="001183_0010_0FB0FF5F2C9E87F8"/>
by the same Poetical Rapture, in the words before us he speaks to the Wind. There be some Winds Gentle and Re∣freshing, and there are other Winds that are Stormy and Terrible, and that bring dreadful Desolations on the Earth. Con∣cerning which the Psalmist sayes, They <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fil the Word of God</HI>; Namely, the Word of His Decree, and the Word of His Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>DOCT. That there is a Providence of the God of Heaven, in whatsoever Storms fall upon Men on the Earth.</P>
<P>The Doctrine before us may be O∣pened in Three PROPOSITIONS.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That among other Calamities which men in the world are subject unto, that of Storms and Tempestuous Seasons is one.</HI> Sin has made this world to be a Tempestuous Stormy World. Soon after man had Sinned, God said to him, Gen. 3.17. <HI>The Earth is Cursed for thy sake:</HI> And Storms are some part of the Curse, which the Sin of man has brought upon the world. If <HI>Adam</HI> had not Sinned, there had been no hurtful Storms known
<PB N="12" REF="001183_0011_0FB0FF60AA2A72E8"/>
on the Earth. But now, men are often∣times Exposed to extream dangers there∣by. Sometimes by Storms at Sea; 'so it was with <HI>Jonah,</HI> and those that were with him Sailing to <HI>Tarshish.</HI> Jon. 1.4. <HI>A great Wind made a mighty Tempest in the Sea</HI>; so as that the Vessel had like to have been broken. Thus the Disciples being on the Sea, Mar, 4.37. there a∣rose a great <HI>Storm of Wind,</HI> and the Waves beat into the Ship, which caused them to Cry to the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Carest thou not that we Perish?</HI> The A∣postle <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was at Sea, and an Hundred and Seventy Six persons with him, there was a <HI>Tempest</HI> so great, as that <HI>all Hopes that they should be saved was taken away. Act.</HI> 27.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Stormy Winds have not only proved Hurtful, but Destructive; and that not only at Sea, but on Shore too. Sometimes when men have been in their Houses Eating, and Drinking, or Sleeping, a Stormy Wind has broken down the House, and Killed every Soul of them. That has sometimes been the Fate of Godly Men, as well as of others. So it was with <HI>Jobs</HI> Children. Never∣theless, there is reason to think they were Godly Persons. When his Sons &amp;
<PB N="13" REF="001183_0012_0FB0FF636D898C08"/>
his Daughters were Eating and Drinking in their Eldest Brothers House, there came <HI>a great Wind from the Wilderness, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te the Four Corners of the House,</HI> and caused it to fall, and they were all Killed by the fall of it. <HI>Job</HI> 1.18, 19. Yea, sometimes whole Towns have been destroyed with Dreadful Storms that God hath sent upon them. So it was with <HI>Sodom,</HI> and Three Cities more: A <HI>Thunder Storm</HI> attended with an Earth¦quake, overthrew them all in one mo∣ment. There was a time when the whole World was destroyed by a miraculous Storm of Rain: When the Sins of the world were ripe for Judgment, God o∣pened the windows of Heaven, and pour∣ed down the Cataracts of His wrath on a Sinful Sinning World, and they all perish∣ed, excepting one Family. Some have thought, that there were more men in the world at that Time, than has been in any one Age since. Doubtless, the world wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then exceeding Populous, considering; the longevity of man before the Flood. Many living Eight Hundred, yea Nine Hundred Years and mere. But a pro∣digious Storm of Rain, caused such an In∣undation of Waters as overwhelmed all
<PB N="14" REF="001183_0013_0FB0FF646C4C5CD0"/>
the Earth; and every living <HI>Creature,</HI> excepting what was in the Ark Perished.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That Storms and Tempestu∣ous Seasons do not hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in the World, without the Providence of God.</HI> The Stor∣my Winds do not come of themselves, but it is the Word of the Lord that does raise them. Psal. 107.25. <HI>He com∣mandeth and raiseth the Stormy Wind</HI>: and He layes the Stormy Wind again; <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>He maketh the Storm a Calm.</HI> When <HI>Jonah,</HI> and the Marriners with him were in great Danger by a Storm, it is said, <HI>The Lord sent a great Wind, and there was a mighty Tempest in the Sea.</HI> Whether we speak of Storms in a Literal, or a Metaphorical sense, there is the Hand of Heaven in them. Nahum 1.3. <HI>The Lord has His way in the Storm, and in the Whirlwind.</HI> Men can't cause Storms &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay them again at their pleasure: But the Great GOD of Heaven can do it, and does do it. Psal. 135.6. <HI>Whatever the Lord pleased, that did He in Heaven and in Earth, and in the Sea, and in all deep places.</HI> This will appear from several Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that whatever comes to pass is
<PB N="15" REF="001183_0014_0FB0FF660506C228"/>
Decreed in Heaven.</HI> And therefore there is a Providence of God therein: For His Providence is a fulfilling of His Decree. Act. 15.18. <HI>Known unto the Lord are His works from the beginning of the world.</HI> There is a Fore-knowledge, and so a Pre∣determination of God concerning all works that shall be done in the world. Eph. 1.11. <HI>He works all things according to the Counsel of His will.</HI> The great Phi∣losophers among the Gentiles, would acknowledge that there was an hand of Heaven in mighty Events and Revolu∣tions in the world: but they thought it was beneath the Divine Majesty to have an Hand in little matters. But the Scrip∣tures teach us to believe, that there is not the least thing that comes to pass in the world without Gods Decree and Providence therein. Christ therefore said to the Disciples, Mat. 10.29, 30. <HI>Not so much as one Sparrow does fall to the ground without your Father: The hairs of your Head are all numbred.</HI> Which implies that there is not the least thing that happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to men in the Earth, but there is the hand of Providence ordering of it. And if not so much as a little Sparrow does fall to the Ground without the Providence
<PB N="16" REF="001183_0015_0FB0FF6889FB9E48"/>
of God, then surely so great a thing as a wonderful Storm, that shall tear Trees up by the Roots, and overturn Houses, and cause many Vessels to be Shipwreck'd, and thousands of Lives to be lost, does not come to pass without the Providence of God. <HI>Job</HI> does acknowledge the Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which broke down the House and killed his Children, was a fulfilling of the De∣cree of God. Job 23.14 <HI>He performeth the thing that is app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed for me.</HI> As God faith to the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed. <HI>Job</HI> 38.11. So does the Lord say to the Stormy Wind, Thus far shalt thou go, and no further: Such a place shalt thou fall on, and not another. It is the Lord that Determines where and when it shall be, and how many hours it shall continue; what persons shall be hurt by it, and who shall escape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s fury.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Second Causes are Overruled by Him who is the First Cause of all things.</HI> God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n by His Word make Stormy winds, without making use of Natural Causes, were that His pleasure; As by His Word He Created the world out of nothing. But He makes Natural Causes to serve
<PB N="17" REF="001183_0016_0FB0FF69B21DECF0"/>
His Providence in raising the Stormy wind. As Rain proceeds from Natural Causes: the Vapour which ariseth out of the Earth by the influence the Sun hath upon it, produces Rain. Job 36.27. <HI>He maketh the Drops of water according to the Vapour thereof.</HI> The Rain is more or less according to the quantity of the Vapour. These Vapours rise out of the Earth, and especially out of the Sea. Amos 9.6. <HI>The waters of the Sea He pours them on the Earth.</HI> The Rain is generated out of the waters of the Sea, and so pour∣ed on the Earth. And therefore when the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> had it revealed unto him that there should be a mighty Rain, he sent his Servant to look towards the Sea. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 18.43. There appeared ri∣sing out of the Sea, a little Cloud like to a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns hand, and presently the Heavens were black with Wind and Clouds, and a mighty Rain followed. The Prophet knew that in the course of Nature, Rain did arise out of the Vapours that were from the Sea, and so from the moist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Earth. Now it is God that makes these Vapours to ascend. Thus the Prophet <HI>Ieremy,</HI> Jer. 51.16. <HI>He causeth the Va∣pours to ascend from the ends of the Earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001183_0017_0FB0FF6B2E1608E0"/>
that is, from the Sea; for the Earth ends at the Sea. Again, The Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars have a Natural influence in causing Storms on the Earth. Amos 5.8. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k Him that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion.</HI> That is in other words, seek Him that does make both Benign and Tempestuous seasons. The <HI>Seven Stars</HI> are attended with sweet influences. The Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure speaks of <HI>the sweet influences of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades,</HI> which are the same with the Seven Stars. When the Sun enters into that Constella∣tion (which it doth on this Month, yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on this very day of the Month) where the Seven Stars are, there are those kind influences which cause the Grass to spring, and the Trees to bud and blossome. But then, <HI>Orion</HI> is a Tempestuous Constella∣tion: it has been called <HI>Nimbosus Orion,</HI> Stormy Orion; it is a Constellation that appears in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> and as many times attended with great <HI>Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms.</HI> That the Stars of Heaven have a Natural influence on stormy tempestuous s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, we learn from that Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judg. 5.20. where tis said, That <HI>the Stars did fight in their Courses against Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>era</HI>: How did the Stars fight against <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>era,</HI> but by a terrible <HI>Storm</HI>; the Providence &amp; Pow∣er

of God s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arpening their influences? The Jewish Historian informs us, that in the memorable Battle fought with <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>era,</HI> there was a terrible <HI>Storm</HI> of Wind and Rain, mixed with Hail, and that the Providence of God did so order it, as that the Wind was on the back of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and in the face of their Enemies, which made them unable to use their Bowes and Arrowes, and Darts and Slings. Thus did the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars</HI> fight against <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>era.</HI> Now the <HI>Stars</HI> and all their Influences are accord∣ing to the Word of the Lord: they are all under the Conduct and Government of Divine Providence.

It is said, That <HI>the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gel of the Lord went forth and smote the Camp of the Assyrians, and in the morning there were so many of them dead Corpses.</HI> How∣ever, it is certain that when Fire and Brimstone, and an horrible Tempest was Rained down on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> that the Holy Angels of God were the instruments of His Providence therein: For the Angels said to <HI>Lot,</HI> Gen. 19.13. <HI>We will destroy this place, God hath sent us to destroy it.</HI> The holy Angels of Heaven had an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in that most dread∣ful

Tempest. Now the Angels are all ordered by the Word of God: Not only by the Word of His Decree and Pro∣vidence, but also by the Word of His Precept; they <HI>Fulfil</HI> that. Psal. 103.20. <HI>Ye His Angels that Excel in strength, that do His Commandment, hearkening to the Voice of His Word: Ye Ministers of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that do His Pleasure.</HI> Yea, and some∣times by Divine Permission, Evil Angels have a hand in such <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempests,</HI> as are very hurtful to men on the Earth. This we see in the History of <HI>Iob.</HI> Satan had no sooner obtained leave from God, to fall on what belonged to <HI>Iob,</HI> but presently there was a storm of Lightning that killed his <HI>Sheep</HI> and his <HI>Servants</HI>; and a stormy Wind that broke down the House and killed all his <HI>Children</HI> in one Day. But Satan is limited by the Power and Providence of God. Tho' he has an Exceeding great natural Power, he can do nothing without Gods per∣mission: he can't so much as bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w a Feather, much less cause a wind that shall blow down a House, Except God give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve. He would fain have, taken away <HI>Iob</HI> Life as well as his Children but God would not let him do it. The Devil

could not possess so much as one of the <HI>Gadarens</HI> swine, till Christ gave him leave to do it. So then as to <HI>Second Causes,</HI> we see they are overruled by Him that is the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Great Cause</HI> of all things.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Truth before us is Evident, <HI>In that the God of Heaven is the Lord of Hosts.</HI> All the Creatures in the world are his Hosts. He is often set forth by that style in the Scripture. He is called, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> no less than an hun∣dred and thirty times by two Prophets, <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> For that all the Creatures in the world are at His beck, and disposal. Dan. 4.35. <HI>He rules in the Armies of Heaven, and does according to His Will among the Inhabitants of the Earth: None can stay His hand; or, say to Him, what dost thou</HI>? There is a <HI>Glorious world,</HI> which is to us <HI>Invisible,</HI> and in that world there is a mighty Host: There are Ten Thousand times Ten Thousand holy An∣gels; many Millions of them that are at Gods Command, whom they all acknow∣ledge as their only Lord and Soveraign. Neh. 9.6. <HI>The Host of Heaven do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wor∣ship Him.</HI> And all Creatures in the <HI>Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Heavens,</HI> are also part of his Host, and

at the Disposal of the most high God. If He sayes to the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Firmament, <HI>Stand st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll thou Sun!</HI> It shall not stir one Inch. As in the days of <HI>Joshua,</HI> he be∣ing inspired by the Spirit of God, Josh. 10.13. spake to the <HI>Sun,</HI> and said, <HI>Thou Sun stand still over Gibeon, and thou Moon over Aj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lon</HI>: and the Sun stood still, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day together. Or, if He sayes to the <HI>Sun</HI> that it shall go backward, it will do so the <HI>Sun</HI> will fufil His Word. As in the dayes of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Isa. 38.8. <HI>the Sun went back Ten Degrees.</HI> And as to all the <HI>Stars</HI> of God that are in the Firmament, they are all at His beck. <HI>He tells the Number of them</HI>: which is more than any mortal man can do. Late <HI>Astronomers</HI> have by the help of the <HI>Telescope,</HI> dis∣covered great Numbers of <HI>Stars</HI> which in former Ages men had no sight or know∣ledge of.

Thus we see that men cannot tell the Number of the Stars. Whenas the God that made them does not only Number them, but <HI>Calls them all by their Name.</HI> Psal. 147.4. He has a Name for every particular <HI>Star</HI> in the Firmament: Which implies His absolute Dominion over them. No Souldiers in an Army are at the Command of their General, as all the <HI>Stars</HI> are at His Word, who is <HI>the Lord of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts.</HI> So concerning inferiour Creatures in the Air, Earth and Sea, all of them are at the disposal of His Will. The Clouds are so, Isa. 5.6. <HI>He Commands the Clouds.</HI> If <HI>Storms</HI> brake out of Clouds, God Com∣mands the Clouds when it is so. And when there is a <HI>Snowy Storm,</HI> that fulfils His Word, Job 37.6. <HI>He sayes to the Snow, be then upon the Earth.</HI> So concerning <HI>the Hail,</HI> Job 38.22. <HI>Hath then</HI> (says God to <HI>Job</HI>) <HI>seen the Treasures of the Hail, which i have reserved against the time of Trouble, and against the day of Battle and War</HI>?

38. 35. <HI>Canst thou send Lightnings, that they may go and say unto thes, behold, here are we</HI>? The Lightning says to God, Here we are ready for any service thou hast for us to do. These <HI>Coals of Fire,</HI> are <HI>the Arrowes</HI> of the Lord of Hosts. <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.6. No man shall ever receive any hurt by Lightning, Except the Word of the Lord say it shall be so. And no man can Escape that Arrow, if the Lord of Hosts say it shall strike him: <HI>Theo∣doricus</HI> (an impious K. of the <HI>Franks</HI>) as he was robbing a Church, was killed with that Fire of God. And I have some∣where read of a King, that was killed by Lightning in the midst of his Army. All his Army could not save him from that <HI>Arrow</HI> of <HI>the Lord of Hosts.</HI> The like also is to be said concerning <HI>the Winds</HI>▪ they are at the dispose of Him who is <HI>the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Psal. 18.10. <HI>He rides on the wings of the Wind.</HI> The Lord is said to ride on them, as denoting to us that He orders and disposes of them. He is said to hold the Winds on His fist. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.4. He lets them go to do Ex∣ecution when and where he pleases; and restrains them again when He pleases.

For that He has as much power to dispose of the Wind, as any man has of that which is his Treasure, that he may dispose of as he wi'd. Thus we see that God is <HI>the Lord of Hosts,</HI> and therefore all Creatures are ordered by Him. Well then might the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> speak, as in. Isa. 29.6. <HI>Thou shalt be visited by the Lord of Hosts, with Thunder, with Storm and Tempest, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</HI> God who is the Lord of Hosts, orders such visitation for the Children of men here in the world.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>The God of Heaven has Holy Ends in it, when He does visit the Earth with dreadful Storms and Tempests.</HI> He has Infinite Reason for what He does: He does nothing in vain. In the Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judg∣ment of God, all the world will see that at is so.</P>
<P>But more particularly;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes God sends dreadful Storms in Mercy.</HI> In mercy to those that are His. Some of the Elect of God, have by such Providences been brought to the acknowledgment of the Great God, so
<PB N="27" REF="001183_0026_0FB0FF7BE9B78CD8"/>
as to seek and serve Him. Psal. 83.15. <HI>Persecute them with thy Tempest, and make them afraid with thy Storm, that they may seek thy Name.</HI> God sometimes causes Storms and Tempests to make men seek his Name, humbly to fall down before Him, and beg for his Favour. Some Care∣less, Graceless Souls have thereby been Awakened to Pray. <HI>Psal.</HI> 107.23. They that go down to the Sea in Ships, see the wonders of God in the Deep; He raiseth <HI>the Stormy Wind,</HI> they mount up to the Heaven, and go down to the Deep; they reel to &amp; fro, &amp; are at their wits ends: And, ver. 28. <HI>Then they Cry to the Lord,</HI> and He saves them out of their Distresses. Some that have lived without God in the world, yet when they have been in terrible storms at Sea, they have Cryed and Prayed to God. And altho' it be sadly true, that most com∣monly men that have done so, after the Storm is over, and they delivered from their Fears &amp; Dangers, forget the God of their salvation. Nevertheless, it is not so with all. It is not wont to be so with the Elect of God, whom He hath purposes of mercy unto. They will never forget the Storms which they met with at Sea,
<PB N="28" REF="001183_0027_0FB0FF7D31849ED8"/>
and their Sea-Deliverances, and the Vows they have made to God to be His Ser∣vants. Thus the Marriners that were with <HI>Jonah,</HI> Jon. 1.15. After God had sent a terrible Storm on them, and had wonderfully Delivered them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is said, <HI>the men feared the Lord Exceedingly,</HI> and therefore Sacrificed and made Vows. Did they not make Vows that they would be the servants of true God as long as they lived? And indeed that Storm proved a Mercy to the greatest City in the world. It did occasion the Prophet <HI>Jonah,</HI> to go and Preach the Word of God to them, which else he had not done, whereby many of them were brought to Repentance. Many times, that Storm which is a Judgment to some, proves a Mercy to others. The Storm that hapned on our Coast Yesterday and the Day before,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was Preached the</HI> 9<HI>th. of April,</HI> 1704.</NOTE> has proved a Mer∣cy unto us, in that the <HI>French Privateer</HI> designing to do us hurt, has suffered Shipwreck; a Stormy Wind has done more for us in one Day, than we have for a long time done for our selves. But it is the Lord that hath done it. The
<PB N="29" REF="001183_0028_0FB0FF7EAC984668"/>
same storm that sends some to Hell, car∣ries others to Heaven. The Prophet <HI>Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven.</HI> 2 King. 2.11. Many that belong to God have been translated to Heaven by a stormy Whirlwind, which has then been a Mercy to them. Yea, sometimes a dreadful Storm, has proved a Mercy to a whole Nation. So did that Hail-storm, which fell on the Army of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> who were the Enemies of the Lords People, in the dayes of <HI>Joshua,</HI> when God did cast down Hail-stones from heaven which discomsited and de∣stroyed them. A dreadful <HI>Storm</HI> that hapned when the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation was under the Government of a Woman as the Chief Ruler, it was a National Mer∣cy to the People of God. It is said con∣cerning their Eenemies, That <HI>the River of Kishan swept them away.</HI> Judg. 5.21 Writers tell us, that the <HI>River Kishon</HI> was fordable; ordinarily men might safely wade over it, but a sudden Storm raised the River so as that when the <HI>Canaanites</HI> in their Flight attempted to pass over it, they were drowned in it. And besides what is mentioned in the Scriptures, I may put you in mind of
<PB N="30" REF="001183_0029_0FB0FF8029F63000"/>
other instances, in which Storms have proved a great Mercy to the Church of God. So it was in the Dayes of the Emperor <HI>Theodosius,</HI> when he was sorely distressed, and his Christian Army in extream danger of being routed &amp; ruined, the Lord by a Tempest caused the wea∣pons of the Enemy to turn upon them∣selves, so that the Good Emperour and the Christians with him obtained a Glo∣rious Victory. In the Year 719. a stor∣my Wind scattered a great Navy of the <HI>Saracens</HI> who were then infecting the Christian world, so that scarce Ten Ships of many Scores escaped that Destructi∣on. <HI>Holland</HI> has often suffered much by Storms and Inundations. Never∣theless that which hapned 1574. was a Mercy to that Nation: For it delivered them from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were then Encamped before <HI>Leyden.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Nation ought never to forget the me∣morable 1588. when the Spanish <HI>Armada</HI> thought to carry all before them, but they were in part destroyed by Storms; so that the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> blasphemously said upon it, That the Four Elements were become <HI>Lutherans</HI>; and that God Almighty was a <HI>Lutheran</HI> on that Day.
<PB N="31" REF="001183_0030_0FB0FF82CD78CAA0"/>
So then dreadful Storms have sometimes been a Mercy to the Lords People, and therefore God sent them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For the most part, such Storms are sent by the Providence of God as a sign of His Displeasure for the Sins of men.</HI> As <HI>Elihu</HI> said, <HI>Job</HI> 37.13. They come <HI>for Correction.</HI> They come as a Judgment. There is a real Truth couched in that Fiction of the Poet, That <HI>Pallas</HI> De∣stroyed a whole Fleet for the wickedness which one <HI>Ajax</HI> had been Guilty of. We know that Thousands fared the worse for the sin of one <HI>Achan.</HI> And certain it is, that the sin of one man in a Vessel, may cause the most High to send a storm that shall endanger all the Ships Com∣pany. Therefore <HI>Jonah</HI> made a most in∣genuous Confession, Jon. 1.12. <HI>I know</HI> (said he) <HI>that this great Tempest is up∣on you for my sake.</HI> When there was an unusual <HI>Thunder Storm</HI> in the Land of Israel, <HI>Samuel</HI> told them that it was a sign of Gods displeasure, and that they had been guilty of great Iniquity in re∣jecting that <HI>Theocracy</HI> which they had been blest under, and desiring a Confor∣mity in their Government to the heathen Nations. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.16, 17. When God
<PB N="32" REF="001183_0031_0FB0FF83EFF661A0"/>
rained down an horrible Tempest on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> it was because there were <HI>Crying Sins</HI> in that place. And as to that dreadful Storm in the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> which has occasioned me to Preach on this subject, we may believe that it is come as an intimation of the Displeasure of the most high God, and that He has a <HI>Controversy with the Na∣tions.</HI> The Anger of God is often in Scripture set forth by that <HI>Metaphor</HI> and <HI>Comparison</HI> of <HI>Stormy Winds.</HI> Jer. 23.19. <HI>A whirlwind of the Lord shall go forth in sury.</HI> God said concerning the Wall that the False Prophets had been building, Ezek. 13.13. <HI>I will rend it with a Stormy Wind in my Fury.</HI> Stormy Winds are oftentimes a sign of Gods Fury. And so may we fear with respect to the late Storm in the <HI>European</HI> Nations. The Queen of <HI>England</HI> has Published a Pious Proclamation, <Q>In which Shee declares, that the like astonishing Calamity has not befallen that Kingdome in the memory of any person living therein. And that Shee must needs acknowlege it is a <HI>Token of Divine Displeasure,</HI> and that it was the Infinite Mercy of GOD, that the QUEEN and all Her
<PB N="33" REF="001183_0032_0FB0FF87328EFA58"/>
People were not Destroyed; and has therefore Commanded a FAST, to be observed throughout all the Realm; Charging Her Subjects to Pray to GOD, for the Pardon of the Crying Sins of the Nation, which have drawn down this heavy Judgment.</Q> Blessed be God for that Royal Pro∣clamation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Providence of God does some∣times send such Storms as Prognostick's and terrible Warnings of Great Iudgments not far off.</HI> Terrible Judgments are used to follow Stormy Winds. When Enemies break in suddenly upon a Peo∣ple, a Storm falls upon them. <HI>David</HI> sayes, Psal. 55.8. Oh! that I had wings like a Dove, that I might hasten my Escape from the <HI>Windy Storm and Tempest.</HI> What is that <HI>Windy Storm</HI>? Was it not <HI>Absoloms</HI> Rebellion? Which put the Land into horrible Confusion. It is said, <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.2. The Lord has <HI>a Tempest and a Destroying Storm.</HI> What was that, but the Army of the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> who made dreadful Desolation in the Land? The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> saw <HI>a Whirlwind coming out of the North.</HI> Ezek. 1.4. What was that, but the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="001183_0033_0FB0FF8952FA8D10"/>
and his dreadful Army? So as to these latter Ages, the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> has fore∣told, That <HI>the King of the North shall come like a Whirlwind on the King of the South.</HI> Dan. 11.40. When the <HI>Turks</HI> broke in upon the <HI>Southern</HI> Nations, then was that Whirlwind. Now as Desolating Judg∣ments are compared to <HI>Stormy Wind,</HI> so dreadful Tempest are signs of such Judg∣ments; and that the Dayes are approach∣ing when we must expect <HI>Great Revolu∣tions.</HI> That the Day is at hand, when God will <HI>Overturn, Overturn, Overturn</HI>: Dire∣ful Storms come to be <HI>Prognostick</HI>; and Intimations of it. Yea, the Coming of <HI>JESUS CHRIST the Son of God,</HI> to Judge the world, will have Storms to be the forerunners of it One sign mentioned as Prodromous of it, is, <HI>That there shall be Earthquakes in diverse places.</HI> Luk. 21.11. Many times terrible Storms are at∣tended with <HI>Earthquakes</HI>: As we hear that Storm in <HI>November</HI> last, was at∣tended with an Earthquake in diverse places. And Earthquakes are usually at∣tended with dreadful Storms. So in that Earthquake in <HI>Sicily,</HI> a few Years ago, when an hundred and forty Thousand fouls went down alive into the Pit in
<PB N="35" REF="001183_0034_0FB0FF8AACD9D3A8"/>
a moment of Time, there were Dread∣ful Stormy Winds, Thunder, Lightning, Rain; such things must be as forerun∣ners of the Great Day, when Christ will come to take possession of this lower world. Another sign mentioned of the Lords coming, is, That <HI>the Sea and the Waves shall Roar.</HI> ver. 25. You know it was so in the late dreadful Storm. How did the <HI>Sea and the Waves Roar</HI>? The words may admit of a Mystical Interpre∣tation, that there will be Storms of War among the Nations, which will put them into strange Confusions; the like not known in the world. We may also interpret the words Literally, That fear∣ful Storms and Tempests shall be sent as Prognosticks that the Coming of the Lord draws nigh.</P>
<P>The late Tempest seems to be the more <HI>Ominous,</HI> in that it comes in Con∣junction with other awful Providences. At a Time when the Kingdoms are moved, when Nations are shaking. When there is Distress of Nations, with great Perplexity: Mens Hearts failing them with Fear and Expectation of the things that are coming on the Earth. The Almighty God ha's cast the Nations
<PB N="36" REF="001183_0035_0FB0FF8C29DB02F8"/>
into Travailing Pains. And is not what we see ARCHE ODINON. Mat. 24.8. <HI>The beginning of Sorrows,</HI> Will not these throws issue in some great Birth? Since the Lord is at this Day shaking the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, &amp; the Dry Land, may we not hope that e're long, <HI>The Desire of all Nations will come</HI>?</P>

<P>We may from hence <HI>Infer</HI> several <HI>In∣structions,</HI> for our Information and Di∣rection.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If, Afflictive Storms do not come to pass but by the Providence of God, then the like is to be said concerning all other Af∣flictions, That there is a Divine Providence Ordering of them.</HI> Affliction comes not
<PB N="37" REF="001183_0036_0FB0FF8EE7CBAAF8"/>
forth of the Dust, nor does Trouble spring out of the Ground. No, It has an higher Original. The hand of Heaven is in it. Indeed as to the Evil of Sin, God is not, nor can He be the Author of it. He can't look upon that Evil. He is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity. But as for Evils of Punishment, they are all from Him. Sin is Evil and has no Good in it, but the Punishment of Sin is Good. Thence there is no Punishment, no Affliction whatsoever but it is from Him. Amos 3.6. <HI>Is there any Evil in the City, and the Lord has not done it?</HI> There is no Evil of Affliction but the Lord has done it. If we speak of <HI>Particular Per∣sonal Afflictions,</HI> the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in them. If a man is afflicted in his Body, with painful Diseases; if he is chastened with Pain on his Bed, and the multitude of his Bones with strong Pains, it is the Lord that orders that affliction for him. If he is afflicted by Losses as to his outward Estate, altho' men may be Instruments therein; Pirates, or Priva∣teers may take his Estate from him, yet it is the Lord that has done it. Isa. 42.24. <HI>Who gave Jacob to the Spoil, and Israel to the Robbers, did not the Lord, He against
<PB N="38" REF="001183_0037_0FB0FF90004C04F0"/>
whom we have Sinned?</HI> And if a man is afflicted in his Name, if he is made the subject of much Reproach and Sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in that Affliction also. Therefore when <HI>David</HI> was Reviled by a wicked <HI>Shimei,</HI> he was wonderfully patient, considering as in 2 Sam. 16.10. <HI>The Lord hath said to Shi∣mei, Curse David.</HI> If a man is afflicted by the loss of his Liberty, if he is made a Captive, or a Prisoner, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in that Affliction. When <HI>Joseph</HI> was sold for a Slave into <HI>Egypt, the Word of the Lord tried him,</HI> and <HI>Joseph</HI> said afterward to his Brethren; Gen. 45.8. <HI>It was God that sent me hither, not you.</HI> There was a mighty Provi∣dence ordering that Affliction for <HI>Ioseph,</HI> in order to the Salvation of many Lives and Souls. Or, is any afflicted (as many are in these sad Times) with the loss of Friends, of near and dear Relations? It is the Word of the Lord that has or∣dered that Affliction for them. And therefore that Godly Widow <HI>Naomi,</HI> who was in great Bitterness for the death of both her Sons, said, Ruth 1.21. <HI>The Lord has Testified against me, the Almighty has Afflicted me, and dealt very Bitterly
<PB N="39" REF="001183_0038_0FB0FF9169CCCA58"/>
with me.</HI> So <HI>Iob</HI> when he lost not only his Estate, but his Children too, in one dismal Day, sayes, Job 1.21. <HI>The Lord has taken away, Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> It was a <HI>Stormy Wind</HI> that <HI>took a∣way</HI> his Children from him, which he was not unacquainted with; but for all that he said, <HI>It is the Lord</HI> that has done it. And if Personal Afflictions are from the Providence of God, then much more may it be said, and ought to be believed concerning Publick Judgments, that <HI>the Word of the Lord</HI> is in them. If a People is Afflicted with scarcity of Provision, it is God that orders such an Affliction for them. Amos 4.6. <HI>I</HI> (sayes the Lord) <HI>have given you cleanness of Teeth, and want of Bread.</HI> If there is want of Rain, it is the Lord that has called for a Drought on the Land: ver. 7. <HI>I witheld the Rain from you, I caused it to Rain on one City, and caused it not to Rain on another City.</HI> Or, if there are Blastings on the Fruits of the Earth, it is the Lord that brings that Affliction. ver. 9. <HI>I have smitten you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Blastings &amp; Mildew.</HI> Or, if noxious Creatures are multiplied to the De∣struction of the Fruits of the Earth, it is God that has sent them. <HI>The Caterpiller,
<PB N="40" REF="001183_0039_0FB0FF957189C340"/>
and the Palmer-worm,</HI> (sayes God) <HI>they were my great Army which I sent among you.</HI> So when Contagious, Epidemical and Mortal, Diseases break in upon a People, it is the Lord that has sent that Besome of Destruction among them. When the Pestilence was in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and there was not one House throughout the Land but the Plague was in it, it was God that sent it. Psal 78.50. <HI>He delivered their Lives unto the Petilence.</HI> The like is to be said concerning that Calamity of <HI>War,</HI> it is the Lord that sends it. He makes Peace, and He <HI>Creates Evil.</HI> That Judg∣ment of <HI>the Sword</HI> is by way of Eminen∣cy called, <HI>Evil.</HI> Isa. 45.7. When the <HI>Reubenites</HI> made War upon the <HI>Hagarites,</HI> and overcame an hundred Thousand of them, tis said, 1 Chron. 5.22. <HI>The War was of God.</HI> Afterwards, the <HI>Reubenites</HI> were overcome by the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> who Killed many, and Captivated many, now tis said, ver. 26. That <HI>the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of the King of Assyria,</HI> who carried them away. Altho' <HI>Ne∣buchadnezzar</HI> in making War upon the <HI>Jews</HI> had his Ambition and Revenge, he fulfilled the Word of the Lord in what he did. It is therefore said, 1 Chron.

6. 15. <HI>The Lord carried away Judah and Jerusalem, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.</HI> Twas God that did it, tho' <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar</HI> was the instrument. That <HI>Whirl∣wind out of the North,</HI> could never have overset the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> if the Word of the Lord had not been in it. Lam. 3 37. <HI>Who is he that sayes and it comes to pass, if the Lord Command it not?</HI> The Emperor of <HI>Babylon</HI> might deter∣mine to lay <HI>Jerusalem</HI> wast, but it would never have come to pass, if the Lord had not Commanded it. But especially when there is (as at this Day there is) a Flame of War broke out among many Nations, the Word of the Lord has done it. When there is a War in which many Nations are concerned, it causes a mighty Storm in the Earth. Thus when the two Greatest Kings in the world fell out, and were engaged in a bloody War. (Namely, the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI>) it put a great part of the Earth into a Combustion. There was in it a notable fulfilment of the De∣cree and Providence of God, and of what the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> had foretold, who had Prophesied of <HI>a Tumultuous noise of Nations, and Kingdoms, the Lord of

Hosts mustring them for the Battle.</HI> Isa. 13.4. So then, such things on the Earth are ordered by the Hand of Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence for men not to Acknowledge God in such Dispensations is a great Evil.</HI> When Stormy Winds happen, men are apt to impute it to Second Causes only, to the Disposition of the Air, the Season of the Year, or the Influence of the Con∣stellations in Heaven, but we should look higher than the Stars when such things come to pass. Our thoughts should be on Him who Rules in the Armies of Heaven. When Devastations are made by a <HI>Stormy Wind,</HI> People are apt to say, the Storm has shattered so many Houses, sunk so many Vessels, taken away the Lives of so many Men: But still we must remem∣ber, that it was the Word of the Lord that did it. Whatever <HI>Storms</HI> of one∣kind or another, whatever <HI>Afflictions</HI> do∣befal men, they ought to take notice of God therein; As <HI>David</HI> did, Psal. 39.9. <HI>I was silent because thou didst it.</HI> The <HI>Philisti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> when they were smitten with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deadly Destruction, were willing to make a Question of it, whether it were the Hand of God or no?

For men not to see the hand of God in awful Judg∣ments that comes on the world, and especially on themselves, argues great Atheism and hardness of Heart. Yet such Stupidity were the Lords Professing People guilty of. Isa. 42.25. When God <HI>poured on them the Fury of His Anger, &amp; the Strength of Battle, they knew it not, they laid it not to Heart.</HI> Truly, not to acknowledge God in any Judgment, is to be more Irreligious than the Magicians of <HI>Egypt</HI> were. When a prodigious Judg∣ment came on them, they could confess, Exod. 8.19. <HI>This is the Finger of God.</HI> Wherefore for men not at all to observe the Finger of God in His Judgments, is to be more Irreligious than those wicked men were. And it provokes the Holy. God to send greater Judgments, when Men don't own His Hand therein. Isa. 26.11. <HI>When thy Hand is lifted up, they will not see: But they shall see, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and be a∣shamed.</HI> Yea, to deny. Providence in

such Dispensations of this nature, is such <HI>Epicurism</HI> and Atheism, as brings De∣struction on those that shall be found Guilty of it. Psal. 28.5. <HI>Because they regarded not the Work of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hand, He shall destroy them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We see that the Lord is a Great GOD, and Greatly to be Feared.</HI> The Power of His Word declares it unto all the world, in that his Word can do such mighty things, and shall be fulfilled. God sayes, Isa. 46.10. <HI>My Counsel shall stand, and I will do all my Pleasure.</HI> There is no Resisting the Word and Will of God All the Creatures in the world can't pre∣vent. His Word from being fulfilled. Rom. 9.19. <HI>Who hath Resisted His Will?</HI> God by His Word made the world, and therefore all the men in the world ought to fear Him, and to stand in awe of Him. As the Psalmist sayes, <HI>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Host of them; Let the Earth Fear the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he world stand in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Him: He command∣ed and it was done.</HI> Psal. 33.6, 8, 9. And it is the powerful Word of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, does preserve all the Creatures in the

world. Heb. 1.3. <HI>He upholds all things by the Word of His Power.</HI> All the Creatures in the world would be Annihilated in one moment, if God should speak the Word, and say it shall be so. His Power on the account whereof He ought to be feared, appears in the Ordinary works of His Providence. It does so in His bringing Rain, especially great <HI>Storms of Rain.</HI> Job 37.7. <HI>The great Rain of His Strength.</HI> God shews his Strength, His Power in great Rains sometimes. So in His overruling the Wind, Isa. 27.8. <HI>He stayes the East-wind, in the day of His Rough-wind.</HI> God has done marvellous things sometimes by <HI>Stormy-winds.</HI> He has rent Mountains thereby. As when the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> was in <HI>Horeb,</HI> 1 King. 19.11. There was a <HI>great wind that rent the Mountains, and broke the Rocks to pieces, before the Lord.</HI> God by a mighty Wind caused the Red Sea to be divided when the waves thereof did Roar, and made it to be a dry Land, for His People to pass over, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.21. And after that He caused his Wind to blow, and the waters returned, so as that King <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his Army were drowned; they <HI>sank a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lead into the mighty waters.</HI> And
<PB N="46" REF="001183_0045_0FB0FF9EEE72CAF8"/>
when all the Earth was overflown, that the highest Mountains were fifteen Cu∣bits under water. God by making a wind pass over the Earth, turned back the waters again, and caused the dry Land to appear. Gen. 8.1. So then He is a Great God and greatly to be Feared. It is said of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> that when God sent an unsual Thunder Storm among them, They <HI>feared the Lord greatly.</HI> 1 Sam. 12.18. And in <HI>Ezra's</HI> time, when there was such a Storm of Rain as did threaten a Famine, Ezr. 10.9. <HI>All the People trembled because of the Great Rain.</HI> You heard the last Lords Day, that when God sent a <HI>mighty Tempest,</HI> the Sea-men who were Sailing to <HI>Tarshish, feared the Lord Exceedingly.</HI> God has made men to stand in awe of Him (and they ought to do so) by such Dispen∣sations of his Providence. They should fear to offend so Great a God. Psal. 65.8. <HI>They that dwell in the utmost parts of the Earth are afraid at thy tokens.</HI> That is to say, at the tokens of thy Displeasure. And what are those tokens of the Anger of God? Thunder, Lightning, Earth∣quakes, Stormy Winds, Dreadful Tem∣pests, and the like. These are the tokens
<PB N="47" REF="001183_0046_0FB0FFA069ABB980"/>
of Gods Anger, and the effects of His Power, that should make men afraid. Shall not poor mortal Creatures be afraid to offend that God, who can by a <HI>Stormy Wind</HI> blow them into Everlasting De∣struction when he pleases. Fear Him, yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We may hence Conclude that Wicked men who are the Enemies of God must needs Perish.</HI> He can by His Word bring a Destroying Storm upon them, which they can neither resist nor escape. It is said of a sinner, Job 27.21. <HI>An East wind takes him away, and a Storm hurles him out of his place.</HI> God can soon raise such a Whirlwind as none of his Enemies shall be able to stand before it. As He threatned <HI>Rabbath,</HI> the chief City among the Amonites. Amos 1.14. That it should be destroyed with a <HI>Tempest</HI> in <HI>the Day of the whirlwind.</HI> Such a Whirlwind is coming on the wicked of the Earth Jer. 23.19. <HI>A whirlwind of the Lord shall go forth, and it shall fall grievously on the Head of the wicked.</HI> There is then no standing before that God, who can by His Word do such things. The <HI>Sixth Seal</HI> in the <HI>Revelations</HI> is a Prediction
<PB N="48" REF="001183_0047_0FB0FFA3A2E7A758"/>
of wonderful Revolutions (long since accomplished) to be in the world, that all the Pagan Powers in the Roman Empire should fall, and that Christianity among the Nations should prevail. The Devil and all his instruments did what∣ever they could to hinder such a thing from coming to pass, but the Word of the Lord was fulfilled in it. The great∣est of men could not then stand before a provoked God. Therefore the Greatest Men on Earth, Kings, and Mighty Gene∣rals, are introduced as calling upon the Rocks, to hide them from the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Him that sitteth upon the Throne, saying, <HI>The Great Day of His wrath is come, &amp; who shall be able to stand</HI>? It will not be long before the Son of God will come down from Heaven, when there will be the most terrible Storm of Thunder &amp; Lightning, that ever was known since the world began; whereby the Proud, and all they that do Wickedly shall be Consumed. Then will that Scripture be fulfilled, Psal. 50.3. <HI>Our God shall come, a Fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very Tempestuous round about Him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Let us hence be Exhorted to make a due Improvement of that dreadful Storm that the Lord has sent among the</HI> European <HI>Nations</HI>: The astonishing tidings where∣of, arrived to us in <HI>America,</HI> a few day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s since. We may not think that because we were <HI>afar off</HI> from the Fury of that Storm, that therefore we need not to have any concerned thoughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out it. It was said to those that we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e afar off from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Jer. 51.50. <HI>You that have escaped the Sword, remember the Lord a∣far off, and let</HI> Jerusalem <HI>come into your minds.</HI> Even so, We that have escaped the Destruction of that Stormy Wind, yet ought to remember what the Lord has done afar off: and let it come into our minds. For truly, the Providence of God was very Extraordinary in it. Whether we speak of the Extent of it, which has been beyond what has been ordinarily known. For it raged not only in <HI>England,</HI> but in <HI>Holland,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> and <HI>France, Ham∣burg,</HI> and in many places in <HI>Germany, Denmark,</HI> and all along the Coast of the
<PB N="50" REF="001183_0049_0FB0FFA6776409D8"/>
<HI>Baltick</HI> Sea. Or, if we speak of the dismal Devastations made by it: <HI>Come and behold the Works of the Lord, the Desolations which He has made in the Earth.</HI> We hear that in <HI>France,</HI> their Capital City received much Damage, and all the Neighbouring Countrey, besides several other places. In that Kingdome, it is said that <HI>Callis,</HI> and the City of <HI>Roan</HI> have suffered very much; &amp; that Eight French Ships of War were Destroyed by that Stormy Wind. And no Question but that whole Kingdome has received more Damage by it, then we are as yet informed of. In the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> no less than Six Cities were shattered by it as if they had been Bombarded. In <HI>Ostend,</HI> a third part of the Town de∣stroyed, and an Hundred Ships lost. In <HI>Holland,</HI> several Villages at the Texel laid under water. In <HI>Friseland,</HI> the Sea broke in upon them, and overwhelmed a Fourth part of the Countrey. And in <HI>England</HI> we know that it was Dreadful. Several Ships of War, and Hundreds of other Vessels lost. And it is supposed that not less than Seven Thousand Sea∣men perished: Many Houses utterly de∣molished, and many more greatly defa∣ced.
<PB N="51" REF="001183_0050_0FB0FFA8028727E0"/>
So that there is in this Provi∣dence a speaking Voice of Heaven to the whole World that shall hear of it. God has been terrible in His Doings. Therefore are we concerned to make a due Improvement of it! And what Im∣provement?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It should awaken us to Repent and Turn to God test He send Storms on us also.</HI> As when the Children of Israel saw some of their Brethren perishing by an Earthquake, Num. 16.34. They fled <HI>at the Cry of them</HI>; saying, lest the Earth swallow us up also. Doubtless, there was a <HI>Great Cry</HI> in the Vessels Cast away, when the Seamen saw themselves perish∣ing, there was a Great Cry among them▪ and a <HI>Great Cry</HI> among their Relation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when they understood what God had done. We that hear of that Cry, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld turn to God lest the like befal us also. Our Saviour Christ has instructed us, to make this Improvement of awful Dispensations Luk. 13.5. When there was some taken away by a sudden stroke, those (sayes Christ) were not greater Sinners than others, but <HI>Except you Re∣pent, you shall likewise Perish.</HI> That is the Use we should make of this tremen∣dous
<PB N="52" REF="001183_0051_0FB0FFA978E32410"/>
Hand of Heaven, to Repent, that we might not likewise Perish. GOD that sent such a Storm on <HI>England,</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> send such on one, and a greater on <HI>New-England.</HI> God can soon do to <HI>Boston,</HI> as He has done to <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and to many other Towns in <HI>England.</HI> Then, are we not concerned to Turn unto Him, that we may escape the terror of his Hand? When the E∣nemies of the Lords. People were cut off by dreadful Judgments, God expected that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should fear Him. Surely when not our Enemies only, but our Brethren, and those of the same Christian. Protestant Religion with us, are bleeding under doleful Judgments, we should re∣ceive Instruction thereby. Zeph. 3.6. <HI>I cut off the Nations</HI> (sayes the Lord) <HI>and made their Towers desolate: I said, surely they will fear me.</HI> Not long before that Prophecy, <HI>Nebuchadnezzars</HI> Father sacked <HI>Nineveh,</HI> the greatest City in the world; on whose Walls there were Fifteen hun∣dred Towers. Now God expected that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should Repent of those Sins. that provoked him to deal so with the Nations who were some of them afar off. Let us by Repentance prevent a Storm.
<PB N="53" REF="001183_0052_0FB0FFAB187B3258"/>
Zeph. 2.3. <HI>Gather your selves,</HI> that is in a way of Repentance and solemn Humi∣liation, <HI>before the Decre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bring forth, be∣fore the Anger of the Lord come on you.</HI> And if we do so, <HI>It may be we shall be hid in the Day of the Lords Anger.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This awful Providence should put us upon <HI>Earnest Prayer to God, that the Wrath of Heaven may not fall upon our Nation.</HI> For truly this Storm seems to be Ominous of a Storm of another Nature hastening<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Nati∣on. The tearing up so many Trees by the Roots, makes me think of the threat∣ning the Lord denounced against His People <HI>Israel,</HI> 2 Chron 7.20. <HI>I will pluck them up by the Roots, out of the Land I have given them.</HI> If when there was but Eighteen men destroyed by the fall of a Tower on them, it was an <HI>Omen</HI> to the Jewish Nation and to the City of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> that their Towers should fall, that the Temple should fall, that the National Religion Established among them should fall: May we not fear, when not Eighteen only, but more than Eighteen Hundred have at once been taken out of the world, by a sudden un∣expected
<PB N="54" REF="001183_0053_0FB0FFAC6BDF7DB8"/>
expected blow, that it may intimate terri∣ble things coming on a Sinful Nation. But the most dreadful <HI>Omen</HI> of all is, he Sins ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are &amp; have been in the Land. In one of the latter Reigns, the whole Land was overwhelmed with horrible Debau∣chery. And we may fear that there is yet a terrible Wrath from Heaven coming for those Sins. Moreover, The <HI>Caroline Persecution</HI> was a dreadful one. How many Thousands did then perish by cruel Imprisonments? Nay, how many Thousand Families were ruined, because they dared not sin against their Consci∣ences? And altho' in the Last, and in the Present Reign, (which the Lord make prosperous) indulgence is granted in matters relating to Conscience (that may be a lengthning of Tranquility;) Nevertheless, in the Day that God vi∣sits the <HI>English</HI> Nation, He will visit on the account of Former Iniquities, as well as for Latter ones. What a Glorious Reformation was there in <HI>Josiahs</HI> Reign? Yet 2 King. 23.26. God did not turn from the fierciness of His Anger, because of the Sins that <HI>Manasseh</HI> provoked him with. <HI>Manasseh</HI> the King of <HI>Judah</HI> had been Dead some scores of Years before
<PB N="55" REF="001183_0054_0FB0FFAF163BAA68"/>
the Nation was destroyed for his sins. But there are still grievous Sins in the Nation. I mentioned it before, that the QUEEN in Her <HI>Proclamation</HI> for a Fast to be observed all the Kingdome over, because of the Displeasure of God mani∣nested in that dreadful Storm, sayes there are <HI>Crying Sins in the Nation, which have drawn down that heavy Judgment.</HI> Alas that there are Heaven-daring provoca∣tions. I was the last week amazed to read a Printed Letter, written by a <HI>Con∣formist,</HI> who sayes, They have cause to be afraid left <HI>England</HI> have <HI>Sodoms</HI> Punish∣ment, and be destroyed with <HI>Fire and Brimstone</HI> from Heaven. For some were so wicked as to bid open Defiance to the Judgments of God. That very Day the Storm was, in a Play-house they acted Thunder and Lightning, and the falling down of Chimnies, the Audience clap∣ping their Hands, and making themselves Sport thereat. Be Astonished at this, O ye Heavens! Will not the Lord be aven∣ged on such a Nation as this! O the In∣finite Patience of the long suffering God, that the Earth does not open its Mouth, for such sinners to go down alive into the Pit! History tells us, that when <HI>A∣ladius</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="001183_0055_0FB0FFB043BAB258"/>
(one of the old Latin Kings) would be so impious as to imitate <HI>Joves</HI> Thunder and Lightning, the Earth in that moment, opened its mouth, and he and all his House were swallowed by it. But that ever any in a Christian Nation should bid such Defiance to Heaven, is prodigious. This may make us fear, &amp; should awaken us to implore the Mercy of Heaven, that utter Destruction may not come on the dear Land of our Fa∣thers Sepulchres. Who knows, but Prayer may be a means if not wholly to <HI>Avert</HI> desolating Judgments, yet to <HI>Divert</HI> them for a time. As it was with <HI>Nine∣veh</HI> when they Cried to God, that Judg∣ment which otherwise had overtaken them in Forty Dayes, did not come un∣til Forty Years werexpired. They said, <HI>Who can tell, if God will turn from His fierce An∣ger that we perish not</HI>? So, who can tell what Prayer may do? And we have the more reason to Pray, for that our own welfare is wrap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up with theirs. If Desolations come upon <HI>England,</HI> it can't be well with <HI>New-England.</HI> However, if direful. Plagues must make the Earth Empty, let them find us Praying, and Mourning for the Sins of the Times, and
<PB N="57" REF="001183_0056_0FB0FFB319CC0CB8"/>
whatever comes it shall go well with us. When Angels with Slaughter wea∣pons i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their hands, are to destroy ut∣terly, there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ack set on them that Sigh and Cry for all the Abominations that are done in the midst of the City. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9.4. It may be they shall be favoured with signal Temporal Preservation: But if not, they shall have Spiritual and Eter∣nal Presentations, which are a Thousand times more desirable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Improvement that we should make of this awful Providence is to beware of those. Evils that use to be attended with Storms.</HI> Whether we speak of Storms in a Literal-sense, or of Storms of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Judgments. As now, <HI>Security</HI> is one of those Evils. When men are secure; God sends a Storm to awaken them with a Vengeance. 1 Thes. 5.3. When they say <HI>Peace and Safety, then sudden Destructi∣on comes on them.</HI> It was so with the Town of <HI>Laish</HI>▪ (it were well if it were not so with <HI>Boston,</HI>) they were <HI>Secure,</HI> Judg. 18.10. and when they least thougt of it, Six Hundred Men fell on them with the Sword and Destroyed them. It has been often observed, that when a People are most Secure, then terrible Judgments have
<PB N="58" REF="001183_0057_0FB0FFB4AE651728"/>
been near to them. It was so with old <HI>Babylon. Bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> made a very impi∣ous Feast, for a thousand of his Lords; yet at that time, their Enemies were in∣vesting the City; but they feared not: they had a River to defend them; a treble Wall, Provision for twenty Years, and Scorned what the <HI>Mides,</HI> &amp; <HI>Persians,</HI> with their Army could do unto them. But while they were in the midst of their mirth, the Scripture assures us that that Night the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> was slain: and History informs us, that all his Nobles were slain with him in that Night of their profound security. And <HI>Mystical Babylon,</HI> (<HI>Rome</HI> that is) when she shall say, I have no sorrow, then her Plagues, Death and Mourning come upon her in one Day. Therefore beware of Securi∣ty, which brings unexpected Storms. And let us beware of <HI>Sinful Storms.</HI> Where there are great Divisions &amp; Contentions, there use to be Sinful Storms: And such Evils are oftentimes attended with <HI>Storms of Persecution.</HI> It was so as to diverse of those Persecutions which befel Christians in the Primitive times: Especially before that of the Emperor <HI>Aurelian</HI>; Professors of Religion were scandalously
<PB N="59" REF="001183_0058_0FB0FFB649918238"/>
abusing one another. When <HI>Sheep</HI> are scattering from one another, God lets loose <HI>Wolves</HI> to drive them together And Oh! Beware of <HI>Crying Sins.</HI> It was the <HI>Crying Sins of Sodom</HI> that brought the <HI>horrible Tempest</HI> on them. But what were they? Oh! that there were not a∣ny of them in <HI>Boston.</HI> But the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> tells us that the Sins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> were, <HI>Pride, Fulness of Bread, and abun∣dance of Idleness.</HI> Are not those Sins in <HI>Boston?</HI> Is there not a great deal of Pride, as to Vanity in Apparel? And are not Prosessors of Religion in such a dole∣ful time as this is, indulging their Chil∣dren in haughtiness, in learning to <HI>walk mincing as they go,</HI> without regarding either God or Man, that Testifieth against them? And does not the <HI>Third of Isaiah</HI> say, that for this, <HI>Thy Men shall fall by the Sword?</HI> And is there not Fulness of Bread, aye, and Fulness of Drink too? How doleful is it to be spoken, that Ex∣cess in Drink is become a <HI>Crying Sin</HI> of <HI>New-England.</HI> And <HI>Abundance of I∣dleness.</HI> Are there not Persons in <HI>Boston,</HI> that spend their Time in Publick Houses, there Gaming and Drinking to Excess, and in the mean time their poor Fami∣lies

in want and distress? Oh beware of such things, lest you pull down Storme of Wrath from Heaven, on the place where you live.</P>

Of the Church of God it is said, <HI>O thou Afflicted and tossed with Tempest</HI>! Isa. 54.11. Afflictions come like waves of the Sea, one rolling on the back of another. One Affliction no sooner gone, but another comes. The Waves &amp; the Billows pass over them. <HI>Deep calls to Deep:</HI> Afflicti∣ons so near, that they are within Call one of another. But then there is a World in which there is no Storms. If <HI>Adam</HI> had not Sinned, there would have been no Afflictive Storms on men here in this world; and truly, in <HI>the Second A∣dams World,</HI> that is, in <HI>the Resurrection World,</HI> there will be no Storms. Tis said of that World, Rev. 21.1. <HI>There shall be no more Sea.</HI> Even so, when the Servants of God are got safe into the Heavenly World, there shall be no more
<PB N="61" REF="001183_0060_0FB0FFB92986BCC0"/>
Sea. They shall be no more tossed with tempests and troubles: They shall not there meet with such a Sea of Trouble, as here in this wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld oftentimes they are disquieted with. Therefore our hearts should be set on that blessed world. Why should we set our hearts on things below? Why should our hearts be set on Earthly Riches, when a Storm may come, and take them all from us in one Day, in one Hour? Yea, why should we set our hearts inordinately on Friends, Relations, Children? A Storm may Drown them, or throw down an House over them and kill them, as it was with <HI>Jobs</HI> Children. Therefore our hearts should be set on things above. Remem∣ber the Apostles Exhortation, Col. 3.2. <HI>Set your Affections on things Above, not on things on the Earth.</HI> And Christ sayes, <HI>Lay up treasure for your selves in Heaven, where Thieves cannot break throw and Steal.</HI> So where Storms can't break in and de∣prive of that Treasure. And if our hearts be on <HI>the Heavenly world,</HI> it will be a sign that our Treasure is there: And if we have our Treasure there, we have great Riches that shall never be taken from us. A Famous Minister of Christ, when his house was burning, &amp; all his estate <HI>taken from</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="001183_0061_0FB0FFBC31C48E08"/>
him, lifted up his <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> to Heaven &amp; said, <HI>there is my All.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re he had an estate, which no <HI>fire,</HI> nor <HI>water,</HI> nor <HI>storm</HI> could <HI>deprive</HI> him of.</P>
<P N="5">5. We should from the Consideration of such Providences learn, <HI>To be alwayes preparing for sudden Changes and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath.</HI> What sudden Changes did the late Storm, which has occasioned our present Dis∣course, cause in many Families, as well as on particular Persons? And sudden Deaths too. We don't know but sudden Death may take us out of the world. It may come on us in a Night. <HI>Iob</HI> 27.20. <HI>A Tempest stealeth him away in the Night.</HI> It was so with many in the late Tempest which came at Mid-night; and destroyed Thousands in a Night, and some too Persons of a considerable Fi∣gure. One of them an Eminent Bishop, whom I was well acquainted with. He was a Person of great Learning, and of great Moderation to those that Dissented from him, in things that are not the Es∣sentials of Religion. Yet the Storm broke down his House, and killed him &amp; his. We see that no Ranks or Order of men are Exempted from Casualities, and Calamities of this Nature. There∣fore should all make it their Care to be ready for Death at all times, let it come neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so suddenly. Nor is this the on∣ly
<PB N="63" REF="001183_0062_0FB0FFBDCA2D1A40"/>
Storm that has destroyed Houses and the dwellers in them in a moment. In the Year 1500. in <HI>Rome</HI> part of the Popes Conclave was blown down by a violent Tempest, Three of his Minister's killed by it, himself the next day taken out of the rubbish sorely wounded. Our <HI>English</HI> Chronologies speak of a Thun∣der Storm, that made an House to fall wherein a Knight and Eight of his Fa∣mily were killed. And some parts of our <HI>American world</HI> have been subject to <HI>Stormy winds,</HI> that have taken away great Numbers out of the world. Do you not remember since the Governour of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and many with him were car∣ried away by an <HI>Hurricane</HI> and never heard of more? And among us there have been more than a few, that Storms of Thunder &amp; Lightning have taken them out of the world. It was so with the Captain of the Castle, a Good Man: not to mention others, of whom many Years since I gave a Publick Account. And sometimes a <HI>Stormy Wind</HI> without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hunder, has proved fatal to such as have stood in the way of it. There was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cambridge,</HI> here in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the Year 1682, a <HI>Windy Tempest</HI> very Remarkable. It broke out of a dark Cloud; it laid all flat to the ground where
<PB N="64" REF="001183_0063_0FB0FFBF40777220"/>
it came. Many Trees were torn up by the roots, others were broke off in the bodies of them, as if they had been shot off, not hurting the stocks. Old Trees which lay on the Earth, &amp; Stones of a great magnitude were carried away by it, some of which could not be found again. The Cloud it self was filled with Stones, Brush, Boughs, &amp; other things which it had taken up from the Earth, so that the sides of the Cloud seemed like a green wood. A <HI>Young Man</HI> be∣ing in the field was suddenly slain by this Tempestuous wind, &amp; his body much brui∣sed &amp; many of his bones broken. Wherefore let <HI>Young men</HI> as well as others, prepare for sudden Death. But <HI>Sea-faring-men,</HI> especi∣ally are concerned to be always ready for death. It is a sad thing that so few of them are so. Are not the generality of them pro∣fane Swearers, &amp; guilty of other Impieties, altho' there is but a step between them &amp; death continually? The dreadful Tempest has been fatal to that Tribe of men above any other. On which account there is a <HI>Voice of God in this Stormy Wind,</HI> calling to Sea-men to turn from sin, &amp; to make ready for sudden death, that so if their Bodies should in a moment sink into the deep wa∣ters, their precious &amp; immortal Souls may not sink down into the <HI>bottomless pit forever.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, The dreadful Storm which we
<PB N="65" REF="001183_0064_0FB0FFC0E1924CA0"/>
have lately been advised of, <HI>Should cause us to make sure of an Interest in Christ, that so our Souls may be safe forever, from the Storms of Divine &amp; Eternal Vengeance.</HI> Tis said, Isa. 32 2. <HI>A Man shall be an hiding place from the wind, &amp; a covert from the Storm.</HI> What Man is that, but <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> the Eternal Son of God, that Man who is God as well as Man. What Storm is it that he preserves from; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Terrible Storm of the wrath &amp; Vengeance of God? Who can stand before that Storm? No meer man nor creature can do i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Who can stand before him when his Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is poured out like Fire, &amp; the Rocks are thrown down by him? Now the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ</HI> has made that Storm a Calm, &amp; the waves to be still. <HI>Ionah</HI> was an E∣minent <HI>Type</HI> of Christ in this respect, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> willing to be thrown into the Sea, that so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the storm might cease. Joh. 1.12. <HI>Take me &amp; cast me into the Sea, so shall the Sea be Calm unto you.</HI> Thus the Lord Jesus Christ has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en willing to be cast into the Sea of Divine wrath that would else certainly have de∣stroyed all mankind. <HI>So that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> And therefore our greatest concernment is to make sure that <HI>Christ</HI> is ours, &amp; then we ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not fear any destroying storms, no nor any destroying Angel. When the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> had the Blood of the
<PB N="66" REF="001183_0065_0FB0FFC232C3D1B0"/>
Lamb sprinkled over the doors of their houses, the destroying Angel might not touch them. Therefore the Apostle <HI>Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> speaks of them that are <HI>preserved in Jesus Christ.</HI> How preserved in Christ? Even as the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were preserved from the destroying Angel, when every house in <HI>Egypt</HI> felt his power, &amp; the anger of God in it. If we are in Christ, why should we fear? We need not fear let the Times be never so dismal: let never such Storms arise in the world we need nor fear. As the Church said, <HI>We will not fear, tho' the Moun∣tains be removed into the midst of the Sea, &amp; the Waters roar.</HI> So, if we have an interest in Christ, altho' as terrible a Storm should come on the whole Earth, as there was in <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, we need not fear. Such as were in the Ark were safe when that storm came. If our Souls are <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ we are safe enough. God said to <HI>Noah,</HI> that he should enter into the Ark, &amp; shut the door that so he might be hid &amp; safe till the Calamity that was to destroy the whole world should be past &amp; gone. So the Lord bids us do. He invites us &amp; encourages us to come to Christ for our eternal safety. I con∣clude therefore with that comfortable word, Isa. 26.20. <HI>Come my peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, enter into thy Chambers, shut the doors &amp; hide thy self, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntil the Indignation be overpast.</HI></P>

<HEAD>GOD is to be Praised, For Giving Snow like VVool.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Psal. CXLVII.16.</BIBL>
<P>He giveth Snow like Wool.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are Five Psalms which begin and end with the word <HI>Hallelujah</HI>; that some have styled the <HI>Hallelujatical</HI> Psalms. This is one of them. As for the Penman of it, there is nothing certain to be fixed on. Some have thought it was written by <HI>Nehemiah</HI>; on occasion of the Re-build∣ing the City of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The Seventy Greek Interpreters, suppose that the Pro∣phet <HI>Haggai,</HI> or <HI>Zechariah</HI> were the Pen∣men of it, whose Names are in their Translation prefixed to it. But they are not in the Hebrew Original, therefore nei∣ther may we affirm them to be the Au∣thors
<PB N="70" REF="001183_0069_0FB0FFC8362EE150"/>
of it. As for the matter of it, it is <HI>Hortatory.</HI> The Psalmist does call first upon all in General, and then upon <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> in Special, to Praise the Lord. Several Arguments are mentioned as In∣ducements thereunto.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those Temporal Blessings that God had Graciously favoured them with. In that their City Gates were set up &amp; made strong, and that their Children, that is to say, the Inhabitants of the City were blessed and increased, and that Peace &amp; Plenty was restored to them after much Trouble.</P>
<P N="2">2. He does Excite them to Praise God on the account of His Providence in the Works of Nature, causing them to be for the benefit of His People. In that He makes the Winter and the Summer, in the several Vicissitudes thereof. The Winter is Described in this, and in the 17. <HI>ver.</HI> The Spring and the Summer are mentioned in the 18. <HI>ver.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And then he concludes with those pe∣culiar Spiritual Blessings which <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had above others, <HI>viz.</HI> The Word of God and His Ordinances.</P>
<P>The words before us to insist on, fall under the Second of these Particulars,
<PB N="71" REF="001183_0070_0FB0FFC9AC81C0C8"/>
in which we hear the inspired man of God calling on the Lords People to Praise Him on the account of what He does in the Winter. We are at this Day in the midst of Winter, and therefore I have singled out the words which have been read, as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting with the present works of Divide Providence.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That Men ought to Praise the Great GOD because He gives Snow like-Wool.</HI></P>
<P>Three PROPOSITIONS will come under our Consideration, all contained in the Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That the Snow is fitly resem∣bled to Wool.</HI> Snow like Wool sayes the Psalmist. And not only the Sacred wri∣ters, but others make use of this Com∣parison. The Grecians of old were won't to call the Snow, ERIODES HUDOR, <HI>Wooly Water,</HI> or wet Wool. The Latin word <HI>Floccus,</HI> signifies both a Lock of Wool and a Flake of Snow, in that they resemble one another. The aptness of the similitude appears in three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In respect of the Whiteness thereof.</HI> Isa. 1.18. The Lord sayes to His People, tho'
<PB N="72" REF="001183_0071_0FB0FFCB34DFB0B8"/>
your sins have been as Scarlet, they shall be <HI>white as Snow,</HI> tho' red like Crimson, they shall be <HI>as Wool.</HI> Scarlet and Crim∣son are of a red Colour, and Snow and Wool of a white. Altho' there is Black Wool, and in some parts of the world there is Snow that will turn Red after it has lain long on the Earth, neverthe∣less, usually Whiteness is the Colour of it. It is a Scripture Expression, <HI>white as snow.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In respect of Softness.</HI> Hence is the Proverbial Expression, <HI>As soft as wool.</HI> So as soft as snow. When it first falls on the Ground, if a man should fall on it, he'l receive no more hurt thereby than if he should fall on Wool. It is near akin to water in respect of the softness of it. This our senses confirm I am not ignorant, that some late Enquirers into the works of Nature, suppose a Snowy Cloud to be an infinite Number of Icicles, and that Snow is Ice, &amp; there∣fore hard. We must then call it woolly Ice.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Third and Chief reason of the Comparison, is, <HI>In respect of that warming Vertue that does attend the Snow.</HI> Wool is warm. We say, <HI>As warm as Wool.</HI> Woolen-cloth has a greater warmth than
<PB N="73" REF="001183_0072_0FB0FFCE9ED5F778"/>
other Cloathing has. The wool on Sheep keeps them warm in the Winter season. So when the back of the Ground is co∣vered with Snow, it keeps it warm. Some mention it as one of the wonders of the Snow, that tho' it is it self cold, yet it makes the Earth warm▪ But Na∣turalists observe, that there is a saline spirit in it, which is hot, by means whereof Plants under the Snow are kept from freezing. Ice under the snow is sooner melted and broken than other Ice. In some Northern Climates, the wild barbarous People use to cover them∣selves over with it to keep them warm. When the sharp Air has begun to freeze a mans Limbs, Snow will bring heat into them again. If persons Eat much Snow, or drink immoderately of Snow-water, it will burn their Bowels and make them black. So that it has a warming vertue in it, and is therefore fitly compared to Wool.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>The Snow is a work of God.</HI> It is He <HI>who gives</HI> Snow like Wool. The Great God owns and challengeth the Snow to be His Creature. Job 38.22, 23. <HI>The treasures of the Snow which I have re∣served.</HI> We see God challenges the
<PB N="74" REF="001183_0073_0FB0FFCFA9C29128"/>
Snow as His property. He and He only has power to dispose of it. As other the like <HI>Meteors</HI> (as they use to be called) are His work. It is said in the Con∣text before us, that He <HI>Scattereth the hoar frost like Ashes.</HI> And the Ice is ascribed to God as His Creature. <HI>He casteth forth His Ice like Morsels.</HI> Job 38.29. <HI>Out of whose womb came the Ice, and the Hoary Frost of Heaven, who has gendred it</HI>? It is the mighty God that makes the soft wa∣ter hard thereby. So Job. 37.10. <HI>By the Breath of God Frost is given, and the breadth of the Waters is strained.</HI> The Frost drinks up the Waters, and straitens them. The old description of Ice, that it is <HI>Copia Aquae in Augusto,</HI> a great deal of water in a little room; late Philosophers approve not of. But we are certain that the <HI>Breath of God,</HI> that is the <HI>cold freezing Wind,</HI> is the cause of it; which <HI>Wind</HI> proceeding from the Providence of God, is therefore called His <HI>Breath.</HI> So again, the Rain is another <HI>Meteor</HI> that God is said to give. Job 38.28. <HI>Has the Rain a Father? Who has begotten the drops of the Dew</HI>? The meaning is, that it is Gods Creature. The Rain has no Father but that God who is the Creator and Father
<PB N="75" REF="001183_0074_0FB0FFD406E6A1D0"/>
of all things. Jer. 14. ult. <HI>Can any of the Vanities of the Gentiles,</HI> that is their Idols, <HI>cause Rain? Can the Heavens give Showers</HI>? They cannot of themselves give Showers. It is true that there are Natural causes of the one and the other. For Snow &amp; Rain are no miraculous things, but that which according to the constitued order of Nature useth to happen. Neverthe∣less, the concurrence of Second Causes does not hinder, but imply the Effici∣ency of the First Cause. God is often∣times in the Scripture, said to do that which He does not do by His own im∣mediate Hand, but which He makes use of Instruments or Secondary Causes in the Effecting of. The Snow is said to be the Gift and Dispensation of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that the matter out of which it is generated is of Gods making.</HI> The Snow is made out of the Elements: But those Elements God the Almighty made by His own Infinite Power. There is <HI>Fire</HI> and Light in the very Snow. But who made the Fire? It was as all other Crea∣tures are, originally from God. Some late <HI>Astronomers</HI> have observed, that there is a mighty <HI>Ocean of Fire</HI> in the body of the Sun. It is the Great God that has
<PB N="76" REF="001183_0075_0FB0FFD4EAF40090"/>
made that Fire. He hath placed it in the Heavens: <HI>Nothing can be hid from the heat thereof.</HI> Psal. 19.6. There is <HI>Air</HI> in the Snow, as appears by the Levity of it. God made the Air. There is <HI>Water</HI> in the Snow, you see it melts into Water. God made the Water. There is <HI>Earth</HI> in the Snow, when it is distilled Earthly particles are observed in it. God made the Earth. So then the Snow is Gods work. The Snow is generated as the Rain is, <HI>viz.</HI> by the influence of the Sun and Stars, Exhaling Vapours from the Earth and Sea, which are turned into Clouds of rain, and into Clouds of snow by the Providence of God: And there is a Glorious Providence of God in cau∣sing it to be so. The holy Prophets of old were affected with the Contemplati∣on of it. We see the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah</HI> was so. Jer. 10.13. And hence when there was a sad Drought on the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> speaks, as in A∣mos 5.8. <HI>Seek to Him that makes the Seven Stars and Orion.</HI> That is to say, that makes Summer and Winter. The <HI>Seven Stars</HI> are the Summer Constellation, they bring on the spring and summer; and <HI>Orion</HI> is a Winter Constellation, which
<PB N="77" REF="001183_0076_0FB0FFD68FBB9680"/>
is attended with snow and cold, as at this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Snow is wholly at Gods Disposal, and therefore His Creature.</HI> There is not a Flake of snow that falls on the Ground without the hand of God. Mat. 10.29, 30. Not a sparrow falls to the Ground without the Will of your Heavenly Fa∣ther, <HI>all the Hairs of your head are numbred.</HI> So the Great God has numbred all the Flakes of Snow that covers the Earth. Altho' no man can number them, that God that tells the number of the Stars has numbred them all. Who is it that or∣ders where the Snow shall fall? Amos 4.7. (sayes the Lord) <HI>cause it to Rain on one City and not on another.</HI> So the Lord causes it to Snow on one part of the Earth, and not on another. As we often see, in such a place there is but little snow, go but a few miles further there is a mighty snow. It is God that orders as <HI>Where,</HI> so <HI>When</HI> the snow shall fall, and how long it shall continue on the Ground, and what Effects it shall have; all these things are ordered by Him. Job 37.12. <HI>He turns about the Clouds according to His Counsel, they do whatsoever He Commands them in all the Earth.</HI> Psal.
<PB N="78" REF="001183_0077_0FB0FFD812EF7150"/>
148. 8. <HI>Firs and Hail, Snow and Vapour, and Stormy Wind fulfilling His Word.</HI> If there is a storm of Lightning, or a storm of Hail, or a storm of Snow, or a storm of Wind, all these fulfil His Word. So then this is His work; and indeed His only. Men can't by all their. skill pro∣duce that which is the First matter of the snow: altho' a man when he has the Materials before him may by his Art produce it. He may turn Water into Ice in the hottest day in the summer. By his Philosophy and knowledge in the Nature of things, he may when materi∣als are before him, produce Hoar-frost and Snow. But as for the first matter, not all the Men on Earth, nor all the An∣gels in Heaven are able to Create it. Nor can men <HI>give Snow like Wool.</HI> They can't give it in that abundance as to cover the face of the Earth. They can't adorn the Earth with that white Robe. No, it is the Great GOD that has made that Winter-cloathing to keep the Earth warm. Therefore the snow is said to be one of His Treasures. Job 38.22. <HI>Hast thou entred into the Treasures of the Snow</HI>? A Treasure notes a great Quan∣tity. The Great God has such Quanti∣ties
<PB N="79" REF="001183_0078_0FB0FFD96AD52A08"/>
of Snow in His Treasures, as that he is able not only to cover the Earth, but to destroy the Earth therewith, if that were his Pleasure.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That God ought to be Praised on the account of this Work of His.</HI> Praise the Lord O <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Praise thy God O <HI>Zion.</HI> Why? For <HI>He giveth Snow like Wool.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God makes the Snow to be a Benefit to Mankind.</HI> It does sometimes come from Heaven as the Gift of God; so when seasonably, <HI>viz.</HI> in Winter, and not in Summer. For in summer it is prodigious and undesirable. <HI>Solomon</HI> designing to shew how unsuitable and pernicious a thing it is to promote Ungodly men to Honour, compares it to <HI>Snow in Summer.</HI> Prov. 26.1. But when it comes neither too soon, nor too late, nor continues longer than is proper for the Earth, it is a Gift of God, and a Benefit to Man∣kind. For the Snow has a fructifying Ver∣tue in it. Isa. 55.10. <HI>The Rain comes down, and the Snow from Heaven, and wa∣ters the Earth, and makes it to bring forth Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater.</HI>

If the Scripture did not tell us so, yet common Experience proves it. The Husband-man finds it true, That a win∣ter with seasonable Snows, is common∣ly followed with a Fruitful summer. Snow-water is many wayes beneficial. Sometimes Floods caused thereby great∣ly Enriches the Earth. And it has a singular Cleansing Vertue in it. Job 9.30. <HI>If I wash my self with Snow-water, &amp; make my hands never so clean.</HI> Of old, in hot Countreys they made use of snow to cool their Wines in the summer time, which is the meaning of that Scripture, Prov. 25.13. <HI>As the cold of Snow in the time of Harvest, so is a faithful Messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the Soul of his Master.</HI> He does not mean snow that falls in time of harvest, for that (as I said before) would be pro∣digious. It did not rain, much less snow in <HI>Palestine</HI> in time of harvest, there∣fore when on <HI>Samuels</HI> Prayer it rain'd, at that time, the People trembled. It was a miracle for it to rain in that Countrey at that time of the Year. So then by snow in harvest is meant that which was re∣served till summer. At this Day in some hot Countreys, they have their

Snow, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llurs, where it is kept in summer, and if moderatedly used, is known to be both refreshing and healthful. There are also Medicinal Vertues in the snow. A late Learned Physician, has found that a <HI>Salt</HI> Extracted out of snow, is a sove∣reign Remedy against both putrid and pestilential Feavors. Therefore Men should Praise God who giveth Snow like Wool.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Glory of God is discovered in this work of His.</HI> Indeed all the works of God do manifest his Glory. Psal. 145.10. <HI>All thy works Praise thee.</HI> That is to say, they give just occasion to men to Praise God. All His works, and in particular this of the Snow, discovers the Glorious Attri∣butes of God before all Mankind.</P>
<P>As now;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We may see the Wisdom of God therein.</HI> Psal. 104.24. <HI>How manifold are thy works? In wisdom hast thou made them all.</HI> So as to this work of his, the Wisdom of God is seen therein. As for the Clouds that contain the snow, the Wisdom of God does appear in them beyond all Humane Comprehension. The astonish∣ing Wisdom of God is seen in framing and forming the Clouds. If we con∣sider
<PB N="82" REF="001183_0081_0FB0FFE1180BA3C0"/>
the Number thereof, Job 38.27. <HI>Who can number the Clouds in wisdom? Iob</HI> was a knowing man, and yet by that Argument, God convinces him of his great Ignorance. And if we con∣sider the Weight of the Clouds, we see the Wisdom of GOD in upholding of them. Job 37.16. <HI>Dost thou know the Ballancing of the Clouds, the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in Knowledge</HI>? God shews the Perfection of his Know∣ledge, His infinite Wisdom in this work of his. He weighs the Cloud as it were in a Ballance; He knows its weight. What man can do this? The Clouds, those weighty Bodies hang in the Air, which shows both the Power and the Wisdom of God. And in that the Clouds of Rain distil by Drops on the Earth; and the Clouds of Snow does fall not all at once: Should one Cloud fall down all at once, it would destroy a whole Countrey. Moreover, Late <HI>Philosophers</HI> by the help of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>croscope</HI> have observed the wonderful Wisdom of God in the Figure of the Snow: Each stake is usually of a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellate</HI> Form, and of six Angles of ex∣act equal length from the Center. It is <HI>like a little Star.</HI> A great man speaks
<PB N="83" REF="001183_0082_0FB0FFE335878590"/>
of it with admiration, that in a Body so familiar as the Snow is, no Philoso∣pher should for many Ages take notice of a thing so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bvious as the Figure of it. The Learned <HI>Kepler,</HI> who lived in this last Age, is acknowledged to be the first that acquainted the world with the <HI>Sexangular</HI> Figure of the snow. Ought not Infinite Wisdom to be Praised? God is Infinite Wisdom: witness every Flake of snow that falls on the Ground, which Proclaims to all Man-kind, that there is a God whose Wisdome is Infinite.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Power of God that also is seen in the Snow.</HI> As in the Rain, so in the Snow, <HI>Iob</HI> 37.6. the small Rain, and <HI>the Great Rain of His Strength.</HI> Tis called so, because God doth shew his strength, what He can do when great Rain comes. So the great Snow declares His strength: as other the like works of His Providence declare the Power of God. In the next verse it is said, <HI>Who can stand before His Cold</HI>? So, who can stand before His Snow? His Power is such that He can make the Cold so Extreme as that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o mortal can stand before it. Job 37.22. <HI>Fair weather comes out of the North, with God is terrible Majesty.</HI> In as much as
<PB N="84" REF="001183_0083_0FB0FFE4B482F670"/>
Fair weather comes out of the North; as when God causes the North wind to blow, there is a marvelous alteration in the weather, this shews that with God there is Terrible Majesty. And the Ice declares the Glorious Power of God. Sometimes there are great floating Islands of Ice terrible to behold. And some of those Islands of Ice have been several scores, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay some hundreds of Miles in length. The Almighty God whose Power can thus congeal the Water, what is not He able to do? In some <HI>Northern</HI> Coun∣tries, the Sea has been so frozen as that Armies with Horses and Wagons, have passed for scores of Miles over it. Chro∣nologers inform us, That in the Year 775. the Sea was frozen for Fifty Leagues, and the Ice was compacted as into a Rock Thirty Cubits deep; also such a quantity of snow falling, as that it was raised to the heighth of Thirty Cubits above the Ice. When God divided the Sea, for the Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofo <HI>Israel</HI> to pass over, He shewed His Power. So when He makes Bridges of Ice, that men may pass over great Rivers and great Seas, there is in it an Evidence of the Power of the mighty God. So are we to say
<PB N="85" REF="001183_0084_0FB0FFE6815AC958"/>
concerning the snow: Especially con∣sidering God does cause it to come by a Word. Job 27.6. <HI>He sayes unto the Snow, be thou on the Earth.</HI> God speaks the Word and it is done presently. As in the Context before us, <HI>His word runs very swiftly.</HI> We often see it, when the Ground is bare, if God speaks the word, the Earth is covered with snow in a few Minutes time. Here is the Power of the Great GOD. If all the Princes and Great Ones of the Earth, should send their Commands to the Clouds, not a Flake of snow would come from thence.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Goodness and Mercy of God that also is discoverd by His giving Snow as Wool.</HI> Deut. 28.12. <HI>He shall open his Good Treasure.</HI> As the rain, so the snow is part of that good Treasure, which God opens for the Children of men. In some parts of the world, not only the Earth is made Fruitful, but Rivers and Springs are maintain∣ed by the snow, which the Moun∣tains of God are never free from. Jer. 18.14. <HI>Will a man leave the Snow of Lebanon which comes from the Rock
<PB N="86" REF="001183_0085_0FB0FFE7AD4D6598"/>
of the Field? Or shall the cold flowing Waters that come from another place be forsaken</HI>? In the Field were Rocks, and out of these came springs fed by the snow of <HI>Lebanon.</HI> In some <HI>Nor∣thern</HI> Countries, the Inhabitants would not be able to subsist, no not in the Winter, if it were not for the snow that covers the Earth like wool. So in <HI>Lapland,</HI> where there is little or no light of the Sun in the depth of Win∣ter, there are great snows continually on the ground, and by the Light of that they are able to Travel from one place to another. <HI>O that men would Praise the Lord for His wonder∣ful works, and for His Goodness to the Children of Men</HI>: Yea, for this good∣ness, which appears in this giving Snow like Wool.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Sometimes God makes known His Iustice and His Wrath by the Snow.</HI> He has dreadfully Punished men there∣with. He brings forth not only Hail, but Snow out of His Treasures in the Day of Battle and War. Sometimes it is a Mercy, and sometimes God makes it to be a Judgment. Tho'
<PB N="87" REF="001183_0086_0FB0FFE92DD8CD18"/>
the snow fructifies the Earth if seaso∣nable, yet if it lies too long it con∣sumes the Land. In <HI>England</HI> in the Dayes of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, a great snow continued very long, &amp; destroyed the Fruits of the Earth, that the next summer there was a terrible Famine. So does God sometimes Punish Men. Job 36.31. <HI>By them He judgeth the People.</HI> By the Clouds, Rain, and Snow, and such like things, He Judgeth the People, He thereby Executeth His Judgments on them. Histo∣rians have Recorded, that in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> an unseasonable Snow destroy∣ed all the Vines in some Countries, to the exceeding damage of the People there. God can make the Snow as well as the Rain a cause of sickness. Not only the Disease called <HI>Bulimia,</HI> but others more fatal have come out of the Snow. <HI>Geographers</HI> give us to under∣stand, that in some Countries Vapours from the Snow have killed multitudes in less than a Quarter of an Hour. Some∣times both Men and Beasts have been destroyed thereby. Writers speak of no less than Forty Thousand men killed by a great Snow in one Day. So then
<PB N="88" REF="001183_0087_0FB0FFEBC53D3790"/>
we see the Justice of God sometimes appears in this Work of His. He is therefore to be Praised. Exod. 15.11. <HI>He is Fearful in Praises</HI>: He▪ is to be Praised for His fearful awful Providen∣ces. Thus we see the Truth Cleared. For APPLICATION.</P>

<P><HI>If we should Praise God for His giving Snow, surely then we ought to Praise Him for Spiritual Blessings much more.</HI> The Psalmist Praiseth God for Temporal Blessings, but concludes with Praises on the account of Spiritual Ones: They as being the Chief are mentioned in the last place. If we are to Praise God when He causeth the Clouds to drop Rain, or the Snow to fall on the Earth, then if He makes His Doctrine to drop on us as the Rain; if we have showers of His Word falling on us every Week in the Year, Praise the Lord O <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Praise thy God O <HI>Zion.</HI> We should Praise God for the Snow, because it is by His Blessing instrumental to produce that whereby the Lives of our Bodies are sustained, but the Word of God, the

Are our Souls Enriched with the River of God to make us Fruitful, and shall we not be Thankful to Him? And for Eternal Blessings, these are unspeakable Gifts of God.

that speaks of the snow, and improve it spiritually. It may well make us think of Scriptures that put us in mind of our own sinfulness. There were <HI>Lepers white as Snow.
