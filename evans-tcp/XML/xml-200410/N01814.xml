<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the Earnest desire of some who heard these <HI>SERMONS</HI> Preached, and thought they were Edifyed by them, that caused me to consent to their being sent to the Press. One who has the Pen of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ready Writer, has Transcribed them, <HI>viz.</HI> the same who Transcribed my Sermons on the <HI>Beatitudes,</HI> and those of <HI>Sal∣vation by Grace,</HI> both lately Published.</P>
<P>If God will graciously fulfill His blessed Promise, Psal. <HI>92.14. They shall still bring forth fruit in Old Age,</HI> Let His Name alone have all the Glory. I have reason to expect that every Sermon I Preach will be my L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st▪

And therefore to ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st on such Subjects</P>
<P>I hope may by the blessing of Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st effectual for the good of Souls, and to promote the interest of His Kingdom. I have often said to my Friends, that I don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desire to live one Day longer in this sinful World. But I humbly beg of God (with submission to His Will,) that while I am here, I may be Serviceable, and at work for Christ. Let Him find me so doing.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the beginning of this Chapter we have a Pa∣rable or Similitude, uttered by the sacred Mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, in which we have first, the thing compare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ namely, The Kingdom of Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="2" REF="002147_0003_0FBC21CE238137D8"/>
by which we are to understand the Visible Church, especially as unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Heavenly dispensation of the Gospel; the Church of God is a Heavenly Kingdom. In a Kingdom there is a King, and Laws, by which it is governed. So in the Church. Therefore <HI>Isaiah</HI> said, <HI>The Lord is our King,</HI> The Lord <HI>is our Lawgiver,</HI> He shall save us. 2dly, Here is the thing to which it is compared, name∣ly, to a King making a Marriage for his Son, and inviting Guests unto the Wedding; of those that were in∣vited there were some refusers, and some comers; by the refusers the Jews are meant, who refused Christ, refused to submit unto Him as King, by the comers the calling of the Gentiles is intended, and of these there are two sorts, some that came worthily, others that were unwor∣thy guests, intimating that in the Church of God there are some that are sincere and godly. Others that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not so, only externally and pro∣fessedly
<PB N="3" REF="002147_0003_0FBC21CE238137D8"/>
Christians, no better than Hypocrites. The words before us have respect not only to those im∣mediately preceeding but to the whole Parable, and they afford to us Three Doctrines, all which are solemn and awful Truths of God.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>That Men may enjoy the outward Calls of the Gospel and be in some measure wrought on thereby, yet not be effectually and savingly Called.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>That Men may belong to the Visible Church of God, yet not be of His Chosen.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. III. <HI>That the Lords Chosen are but Few.</HI> The number of them is comparatively but a very small number.</P>
<P>At this time, only to the First of these Doctrines, Namely,</P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>That Men may enjoy the outward Calls of the Gospel, and be in some measure wrought on thereby, yet not be effectually and savingly Called.</HI></P>
<P>Two Propositions are before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for clearing the Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002147_0004_0FBC21D058F75B80"/>PROP. I. <HI>That Men may be outward∣ly Called, yet not inwardly &amp; savingly.</HI> This is evident, in that the call of the Gospel is Universal, where-ever it is Preached, Mar. 16.15. <HI>Go</HI> says Christ, <HI>into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature,</HI> that is to say, to every reasonable Creature, to every Man and Woman, without excepting any, be they high or low, rich or poor, old or young, let them have the Grace of the Gospel offer∣ed to them, Christ offered to them. Rev. 22.17. <HI>Come whosoever will, and let him take the water of life freely.</HI> Christ who is the water of life, is compared to a Fountain <HI>set open,</HI> Zech. 13.1. Christ is that Fountain set open, that whosoever will may come, the vilest Sinners may come to it, and if they will come and ac∣cept of Christ they shall be cleansed and saved. Where-ever the Gospel comes, God commands every Man that hears it to repent. Act. 17.30. <HI>Now God commandeth all men every
<PB N="5" REF="002147_0004_0FBC21D058F75B80"/>
where to repent.</HI> All Men are Sinners, and God in the Gospel calls upon them to repent, and If they do so, the Gospel Promises their Sins shall be forgiven them. Also the Gospel commands Men to believe as well as to repent, 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Iesus Christ.</HI> Thus it is an universal offer, yet all Men that have it set before them do not accept the offer. So it is said here, when they were invited to come to Christ, <HI>they made light of it.</HI> Some that have the Word of God dispenced to them, they despise it, and the despensers of it. So did the Jews of old, 2 Chron. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.16. <HI>They mocked the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssengers of God,</HI> and despised His words, and mis-used His Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His People, till there was no remedy. So did they deal with the Holy Apostles, nay with Christ Himself; when Christ Himself Preached to them there
<PB N="6" REF="002147_0005_0FBC21D12D4D36B8"/>
were those that derided Him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.14. Christ preach'd an admira∣ble Sermon, but it is said the Pha∣rasees who were covetous derided Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are some that the Call of the Gospel has made some im∣pression on them, yet they have not been effectually and savingly wrought upon thereby.</HI> In the Parable con∣cerning the Sower, there are four sorts of Ground spoken of, but only one of them did bring forth fruit, all the other had some effects wro't upon them, only one brought forth fruit. So of those that hear the Gos∣pel there are but few that bring forth the fruits of Faith, of Repen∣tance and Holiness.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Word of God does sometimes cause knowledge &amp; illumination in the minds of Men, yet no thorow con∣version. Balaam</HI> had the knowledge of the most High, and saw visions of God. Some have had great il∣luminations on their minds through
<PB N="7" REF="002147_0005_0FBC21D12D4D36B8"/>
the power the Word has had on them, yet no saving illuminations, but after that they have proved to∣tal, final Apostates, and have be∣come guilty of the unpardonable Sin. Heb. 6.4. <HI>It is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift,</HI> what is that tasting of the Heavenly gift, it follows, <HI>were made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Men may partake of the Holy in respect of illumina∣tions, common gifts of the Spirit, yet have no saving illuminations. Writers tell us, <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostate had great knowledge in the things of God, yet this Man afterward be∣came an utter enemy to the Christi∣an Religion, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, always mocking and deri∣ding of Him; at last dyed blasphe∣ming the name of our Holy Lord Jesus Christ, notwithstanding he had been greatly illuminated in the knowledge of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Word of God may make great
<PB N="8" REF="002147_0006_0FBC21D2A42CE128"/>
impressions on the affections of Men, yet they not be savingly called.</HI> They may have good wishes sometimes, had not <HI>Balaam</HI> so when he wish'd <HI>Oh that I may die the death of the righteous,</HI> He knew that righteous Men would be happy when they dyed, therefore he desired to die their Death, but cared not to live the life of the righteous. Men may have good desires inkindled in them, yet all come to nothing. Christ preach'd an admirable Sermon con∣cerning the Bread of Life, said the Jews, <HI>Lord give us evermore of this Bread,</HI> Joh. 6.31. Yet those very Men before Christ ended His Ser∣mon took up a prejudice against Him, and tho' they had been His Disciples they went away from Him and walked no more with Him. Men may desire Grace for carnal Ends, an Hypocrite does not desire Holi∣ness as such, but he may desire Grace to save him from Hell. Did not the foolish Virgins so, Matth. 25.8. They
<PB N="9" REF="002147_0006_0FBC21D2A42CE128"/>
unto the wise, <HI>Give us of your oyl for our lamps are going out.</HI> What is that oyl? thereby Grace is meant. Sin∣ners when their Lamps are going out, when their Souls are going out of their Bodies, then their cry is, Oh that we had Oyl in our Lamps, Grace in our Hearts. There are those that have a spirit of bondage that do not attain to a spirit of adoption. Was it not so with <HI>Cain</HI> when he cried out, <HI>My punishment is greater than I can bear,</HI> from the face of God I shall be hid. Was it not so with <HI>Felix,</HI> Act. 24.25. when he heard <HI>Paul</HI> Preaching concerning righteousness, temperance &amp; judg∣ment to come, it is said, <HI>Felix trem∣bled.</HI> Men may have good motions and purposes in their hearts, yet not be savingly wrought upon. Hos. 6.4. <HI>Thy goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it passeth</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ When they heard the Prophet Preach an Awakening Serm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, O how good would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>? But this
<PB N="10" REF="002147_0007_0FBC21D4470593B0"/>
did not continue long, but was like the morning cloud &amp; the early dew. We have a notable instance of this, Deut. 5.27. <HI>They said all that the Lord shall speak we will do it:</HI> Was not that a good resolution? a good purpose? God said of them, <HI>they have well spoken. Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep all my command∣ments always, that it might be well with them forever.</HI> Men may submit themselves to that Ordinance of Baptism, that implies a promise, and intention, and resolution to repent, and serve God, it is called <HI>Baptism to repentance,</HI> because Baptized Per∣sons are bound to repent, they ob∣lige themselves to repent of their Sins, and to serve God, this many have submitted unto yet have not been effectually called. <HI>Simon Ma∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> he was wonderfully affected with <HI>Philips</HI> Preaching, it is said of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 8.13. <HI>He believed and was baptized</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word made an
<PB N="11" REF="002147_0007_0FBC21D4470593B0"/>
impression, but not a saving im∣pression upon him, he was still in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity, his Faith was no more than a temporary Faith. Men may confess their Sins and promise a reformation; so <HI>Pharoah</HI> confess'd his sins, he desired Moses and Aaron that they would Pray for him, says he, Pray for me that my sin may be forgiven: thus <HI>Saul</HI> confess'd his sin to David, the wrong he had done to him, and promises he would do so no more, yet he was <HI>Saul</HI> still. Thus we read of a House swept and garnished, the Evil spi∣rit gone out of it, yet afterwards the Evil spirit returns again, and seven Devils for one before. In the Primitive times, Men who by <HI>the knowledge of Christ,</HI> that is by the Gospel, which alone makes known Christ; by this <HI>knowledge of Christ they escaped the pollutions of the world,</HI> afterward returned again, and their latter end was worse than their be∣ginning,
<PB N="12" REF="002147_0008_0FBC21D59D2739F0"/>
2 Pet. 2.20, 21. Have we not seen it in Young Men, who have been very hopeful praying Young Men, yet those Young Men after∣ward have returned to their for∣mer Sins and vain Companions, and been as wicked as ever before.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How comes it to pass that they who are not the Lords Chosen, yet have the Gospel Preach'd to them.</HI></P>
<P>For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reprobate Sinners have the Gos∣pel Preached to them for the sake of them that are Chosen.</HI> They that are Chosen shall certainly be called. Whom he predestinated, them he also called, called them effectual∣ly. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.38. <HI>As many as were or∣dained to eternal life believed.</HI> If there be an ordination to Eternal life, there shall be an effectual calling. For their sakes the Gospel shall be Preached; and it is Preach∣ed to others as well as to them.
<PB N="13" REF="002147_0008_0FBC21D59D2739F0"/>
Sometimes in a great City there are but a very few belongs to God, and for the sake of those few, the whole City shall have the Gospel Preached to them. It was so in <HI>Corinth,</HI> Act. 18.10. Moreover, some have great Gifts which are em∣ployed for the good of God's Elect, some have been able to Preach no∣tably, thereby some of the Elect have been converted, and thereby many Edifyed, and yet they them∣selves Reprobates and cast away forever; as in building the Ark a great many that had a hand in building it were not saved in it, but perished in the Flood. So many have a hand in building the Church of God, that shall perish Eternally: Many shall say, <HI>Have we not prophecied in thy name,</HI> But Christ will say to them, <HI>De∣part from me I know you not you workers of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is that so obstinate Sin∣ners may be left without excuse,
<PB N="14" REF="002147_0009_0FBC21D8555EF280"/>
therefore such as do not belong to His Election shall have the Gospel Preacht to them.</HI> It is true that the Works of God leave Men without excuse if they dont glorify Him as God, His works of Creation and Provi∣dence; but much more his Word, when they have not only His Works to direct them to fear and serve God, but His Word; Therefore Christ says, <HI>If I had not spoken to them they had not had sin, but now they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve no cloke for their sin.</HI> God speaks to Men by His Gospel, by His written Word which He puts into their hands, therefore their Sin will be the more inexcusable if they conti∣nue in it. If a Man is going on in a dangerous way, and he is told, he will meet with that which will de∣stroy him, if he continue in it, and he will go on therein, he is in∣excusable, he will be guilty of his own Death: Thus it is with Sin∣ners, who are told, if they go on in the way wherein they are, there are
<PB N="15" REF="002147_0009_0FBC21D8555EF280"/>
devourers that will destroy their Souls, &amp; yet they will go on there∣in, they are inexcusable. God sends His <HI>Messengers</HI> which are His <HI>Watch∣men,</HI> to give warning to Men, and if they will not take warning, <HI>their Blood will be upon their own heads.</HI> Paul said unto the Jews, it was ne∣cessary you should have the Gospel Preach'd unto you; it has been offered unto you, and you have dis∣pised it, I will depart from you, but <HI>your blood shall be upon your own heads,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>Act.</HI> 18.6. Thus Men have the Gospel that they may be left inexcusable before the Lord. God and His Servants who have faithfully warned Sinners, will be guiltless forever, but they not regarding the warning, are guilty of their own Death.</P>
<P>Thus we see the Truth clear'd in the Particulars that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>USE. I. <HI>They that have not attain'd so much as this, that have not the
<PB N="16" REF="002147_0010_0FBC21D961BF09C0"/>
things mentioned wrought in them by the Gospel, are certainly very misera∣ble.</HI> There are many have no Gos∣pel at all, and what a condition are they in? Thus it was with the World generally for four Thousand Years together. There was but one Nation that had the means of Grace, and that a small Nation too, name∣ly Israel. Amos 3.2. <HI>You only have I known,</HI> says God. Psal. 147.19, 23. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Iacob, his sta∣tutes and his judgments unto Israel, he hath not dealt so with any nation.</HI> What a woful World was this we live in for a long time? What a dark, dismal Place, before the Sun of Righteousness did arise and shine upon it. After Christ came into the World the light of the Gospel did wonderfully prevail, in the space of Forty Years, namely, from the Ascention of our Saviour before the destruction of Jerusalem, all Nati∣ons had the Gospel brought to them, they had Christ and Salvation offer∣ed
<PB N="17" REF="002147_0010_0FBC21D961BF09C0"/>
to them, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.14. At this Day there are whole Nations, King∣doms, mighty Kingdoms, that have no light of the Gospel, what a case are they in? How then shall they believe in Christ that they may be saved? How shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without a Preacher? Are they not then in a perishing condition? Prov. 29.18. <HI>Where there is no vision the people perish.</HI> Alas for this World! this is the condition of the greatest part of the Children of Men; they have no vision, no light of the Gospel vouchsafed to them, therefore in a perishing condition. The Apostle says, <HI>If the Gospel be hid, it is hid from them that are lost.</HI> There are others have this Light, but what are they the better for it? The Word is Preach'd to them, but it is as tho' it were never Preach'd to them. How many are there like the stony ground, and like those by the way
<PB N="18" REF="002147_0011_0FBC21DADD1FBBF8"/>
side, of whom it is said, <HI>Mar.</HI> 4.4. When the Seed of the word is sown, <HI>immediately the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</HI> Who are those Fowls of the air, but the Devils, He is the Prince of the power of the air. Some the word they hear blinds their minds, &amp; hardens their hearts. 2 Cor. 2.16. It is a <HI>savour of death unto death, unto some.</HI> Some that sit under the powerful Preaching of the Gospel it is a savour of Death unto Death to them; their Death will be the more dreadful, because they have lived unto the Gospel, because they have had such lively, powerful Sermons Preached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, therefore their Death will be aggravated another Day; the dam∣nation of such will be more intol∣lerable, than of those that never heard one Sermon Preached to them in all their lives. Christ says of those that have had the Gospel Preached to them and have not believed, Mat. 10.15. <HI>It shall be
<PB N="19" REF="002147_0011_0FBC21DADD1FBBF8"/>
more tollerable for Sodom and Gomor∣rah in the day of Iudgment, than for such Sinners.</HI> Oh that all that hear me this day, that have lived under the Gospel all their days, would consider. Sodom and Gomorrah will have an easier damnation at that day, than those that have lived un∣der the Gospel, and continued in their unbelief.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>This should put us upon serious Examination whether we are Effectually Called, yea or no.</HI> The knowledge of this is more worth than all this World, yet it may be known. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.</HI> God would not require Men to give all diligence about it, if their cal∣ling could not be made sure of; but if a Man knows he is effectually called he may know he is one of the Lord's Chosen, he may know his Election, he may know he shall as certainly go to Heaven when he dies as if he were there already.
<PB N="20" REF="002147_0012_0FBC21DC94D4D708"/>
2 Tim. 1.9. <HI>He hath saved us an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called us,</HI> that is, hath brought u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into a state of Salvation by effectu∣ally calling of us. If a Man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effectually called, his Salvation is sure, and he may himself be sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it. How shall we know whe∣ther we are effectually called?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We should consider what we are called from, call out of.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.9▪ <HI>He hath called us out of darkness.</HI> What is that darkness? why, a state of Sin is the most horrible darkness that possible can be thought of. If a Man is effectually called, he is brought out of his Sins; there is no way of Sin that he walks in. Isai. 55.7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way.</HI> A Sinner has a way of Sin, but one effectually called has not so, he may fall into Sin, but has not a way of Sin: as Sheep may fall into the mire but wont continue there: So it is with those that are effectually called, there is no way of Sin that they allow themselves
<PB N="21" REF="002147_0012_0FBC21DC94D4D708"/>
in; that Man has utterly forsaken the way of Sin so as never to re∣turn into it any more. <HI>Ephraim</HI> shall say, <HI>What have I any more to do with Idols.</HI> Those Sins that were most dear to him, are become most abominable to him; he turns not from some Sins only but from all, Ezek. 18.30. <HI>Repent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turn your selves from all your transgressions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> iniquity shall not be your ruin.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin loved and lived in will prove the ruin of a Mans Soul. One leak in a Ship may prove the destruction of it as well as many. That one Sin of Uncleanness, a Sinner will as soon part with his right Hand as part with it, but he must part with it or he cannot be saved▪ so that one Sin of Drunkenness, a Sinner must part with it or he cannot be saved, either he must cut off that right hand, or be cast into Hell-Fire.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If a man be effectually called, then he is become a new creature.</HI>

Effectual calling makes a wonder∣ful change in a Man, he is quite another Man to what he was be∣fore: he is turned from a Sinner into a Saint.

to our own Souls: It is true you cannot; yet Sinners <HI>will not</HI> come to Christ. If a Man will come to Christ he must deny himself, he must deny his own righteousness; that the Sinner will not do.

farewell of the Sinner, then they will seek and cry, but God will not hear. I have sometimes put you in mind of a Man that had many Motions, many strivings of the Spi∣rit of God and resisted all, at last fell into Despair, then all his cry was, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o late, too late</HI>; when any one said to him you must repent of your Sins, his cry was, <HI>too late, too late</HI>; when any exhorted him, you must go to Christ, He can save you, his cry was, <HI>too late, too late.</HI></P>

Oh! then take heed of setting your selves to Sleep when God from Heaven is calling upon you.

Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God.</HI> Faith is Wisdom, It is Wisdom to obey the call of the Gospel, then ask of God that you may obey the Gospel, that He would give you Faith; though it is true, Sinners cannot Convert themselves, yet I am perswaded, that there never was one Sinner in this World that continued earnestly crying to God, to give him Grace, but God was pleas'd to give it to him.

<P>WE now proceed to the Second Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>That Men may belong to the Visible Church of God, yet not be of the Lord's Chosen.</HI></P>
<P>If Men are of the Invisible Church▪ they will be of the Visible Church, they will make profession of the Name of God, therefore it is said, Rom. 10.10. <HI>With the heart man believeth, and with the mouth con∣fession is made unto Salvation.</HI> If there is true Faith in a Man's Heart he will ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a confession openly before the World of his Faith, he will let all the World know, he believes there is a God, that there is no God but He who made Heaven and Earth, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he trusts in Him only for Eternal Sal∣vation:
<PB N="31" REF="002147_0017_0FBC21E55DCBA7B0"/>
But a Man may be of the Visible Church yet not be of the invisible Church. By the Invisible Church we understand the Elect of God who are effectually called, or true Believers on the Lord Jesus Christ; all who are of the Visible Church are not such, which will appear from several Things, which are Demonstrations of the Truth before us.</P>
<P>Demon. 1. <HI>Men may be externally in Covenant with God, yet not be of his Chosen.</HI> They that are in Cove∣nant with God belong to His Visible Church, tho' it may be only exter∣nally so; as for those that are of the true Church of God, they are not only Covenanters, but Cove∣nant-keepers, keepers of their Co∣venant with God. Psal. 103.17, 18. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from ever∣lasting to everlasting, upon them that fear him, to such as keep his cove∣nant, to those that remember his com∣mandments</HI>: yet there are many
<PB N="32" REF="002147_0018_0FBC21E7F8B03500"/>
that have enter'd into Covenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with God, that are <HI>Covenant-breaker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Isai. 24.5. <HI>They have broken th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> everlasting covenant.</HI> Men may sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord is their God, yet be de∣ceived when they say so; they may think so, and only think so, as the Jews did; they were not God's Children when they thought they were. Joh. 8.41. <HI>We have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne father even God,</HI> said they, Christ replied to them, if God were your Father you would love me, whereas you do not so, ye are the Children of the Devil, he is your Father, and the lusts of your Father ye will do, My Father honoureth me of whom <HI>you say</HI> that He is your God, they said so, thought so, but were de∣ceived. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.9. It is said of some, <HI>They say they are Iews, but are not so, they are of the Synagogue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Satan.</HI> So are there those that call them∣selves Christians, but are not so▪ Sin, Satan, and the World has still power and dominion over them▪
<PB N="33" REF="002147_0018_0FBC21E7F8B03500"/>
thus are they deceived, not all that profess the name of Christ will ap∣pear to be his at the last day. Mat. 7.21. <HI>Not every one that saith unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven,</HI> says Christ; Not every one that says I am their Lord, and call themselves Christians, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, no, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven; thus we see men may be visibly, exter∣nally in Covenant with God, yet not be of His Chosen.</P>
<P>Demon. 2. <HI>Men may have the Seals of the Covenant applied unto them, yet not be of the Lord's Chosen.</HI> Circum∣cision was once a Seal of the Cove∣nant. Rom. 4.11. <HI>A seal of the righ∣teousness of faith</HI>; it sealed this, that those that truly believed on Jesus Christ that was to come into the World should be justified, and saved; but how many had this Seal apply'd to them that were not of the Lord's Chosen, a whole Nation
<PB N="34" REF="002147_0019_0FBC21E922B095B0"/>
of them; those that never wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made partakers of the Seal of the Covenant were as much accepted with God as they. Jer. 9.25, 26. <HI>I will punish the circumcised with the uncir∣cumcised, Edom, Amon, and Moab, are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</HI> Baptism that succeeds Circum∣cision, the Jews had indeed a <HI>Typical Baptism</HI> when they pass'd out of the Land of Egypt, 1 Cor. 10.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>They were all baptized unto Moses in the Cloud,</HI> that is, they were obliged to observe the Religion that Moses taught them. In the days of the New Testament there was <HI>Iohns Baptism</HI> which was essentially the same with Christ's Baptism. Many had that apply'd to them which were not of the Lord's Chosen. Mat. 3.5, 6. <HI>Then went out to him Ierusa∣lem and all Iudea, and all the region round about Iordan, &amp; were baptized of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI>; They were not all the Lord's Chosen, nay but few of them were
<PB N="35" REF="002147_0019_0FBC21E922B095B0"/>
so; and it is said that Christ Bap∣tized more Disciples than John, in the Fourth Chapter of Johns Gos∣pel, yet there were great multi∣tudes of those that did partake of that Seal of the Covenant which were those God did not approve of. The other Seal of the Covenant is that of the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI>; Men may have that given to them yet not be of the Lord's Chosen, as in the Con∣text, there was one came to the Marriage Feast, and had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Wedding Garment on, the Lord said to him, <HI>How can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou in hither.</HI> Many that partake of that Holy Ordinance, what do they do, they prophane the Name of Christ, they eat and drink Judgment to them∣selves, they make themselves guilty of the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>Demon. 3. <HI>There are Hypocrites as well as Sincere Professors of Religion which belong to the Visible Church of God.</HI> They that are of the Visible Church are Worshippers of God,
<PB N="36" REF="002147_0020_0FBC21EAADB50108"/>
now there are two sorts of Worship∣pers, some that are sincere, spiritual Worshippers, others that are only external Worshippers, and are not sincere in the sight of God. Joh. 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. <HI>The true worshipper, worships God in spirit and in truth.</HI> Some worship God but not in Spirit, they worship God with their Bodies but not with their Souls, these are not the true worshippers, the true worshippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worships God with his Spirit, as well as with his Body. Now there a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e many of the Visible Church of which this cannot be said, therefore they are a state of Hypocrisy. This is a weighty Truth, therefore I shall enlarge upon it, And enquire first, how does it appear there are Hypocrites in the Visible Church of God. 2. Whence doth it come to pass?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How does it appear, there are Hypocrites in the Visible Church?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>The Scriptures plainly intimate this Truth unto us.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.20. <HI>In a great house there are vessels
<PB N="37" REF="002147_0020_0FBC21EAADB50108"/>
not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, Vessels to honour, and vessels to dishonour</HI>; what is that great house, It is the Visible Church of God, therein, are not only Vessels of Gold, sincere Pro∣fessors of Religion are those Vessels of Gold, Vessels of Honour, such as honour God and will be honoured by Him, but there are also Vessels of dishonour, that will be Subjects of Everlasting contempt in another World, yet some such have be∣longed to the Church of God. John Baptist said, Mat. 3.11, 12. <HI>I indeed baptize you with water,</HI> intimating, that was all he could do, and that many he Baptized had no more than the external Baptism, <HI>but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, he shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost, whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat unto the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with un∣quenchable fire.</HI> In the Lord's Floor
<PB N="38" REF="002147_0021_0FBC21EDCE1EF998"/>
there is not only Wheat, but also Chaff; as for the Wheat they are sincere Professors of Religion, the Lord will in His time gather them into His Garner. What is that Garner? It is Heaven. As for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that are <HI>Hypocrites</HI> they are <HI>Chaff,</HI> and that chaff must be burn'd with unquenchable Fire. Several of the Parables uttered by our Lord Jesus Christ the design of them is to in∣timate this holy Truth to us, as this wherein is my Text. The Marriage Supper intimates when the Gentiles should be called there should be Hypocrites as well as Godly Persons. And in the Parable of the Drag &amp; Net, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.47. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Net cast into the Sea, and Fishes are taken in it <HI>both good and bad,</HI> that is to so say, in the Visible Church there would be not only such as were sincere, but such as were no better than Hypocrites. The Para∣ble of the Ten Virgins intimates
<PB N="39" REF="002147_0021_0FBC21EDCE1EF998"/>
this to us, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto Ten Virgins whereof Five were Wise, and Five were Foolish; as for the Wise, they had Oyl in their Lamps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for the other, they had Lamps lighted but no Oyl in them, they made a great Profession of Religion but had not a work of Grace wro't in their Souls, this is spoke of Church Members, of what kind of Churches do you think? <HI>Virgin Churches,</HI> not Idolatrous Churches, but such as made a great Profession of Holiness, in these there are such Fools as content themselves with Lamps lighted but no Oyl in their Lamps.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Truth before us has been confirmed in all Ages of the World.</HI> Ever since their was a Church on Earth there has been Hypocrites as well as Sincere Professors therein, as now, when the Church was in Families a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first it was, in the first Family that was in the World there
<PB N="40" REF="002147_0022_0FBC21EF23923B50"/>
were godly &amp; ungodly ones therein, <HI>Abel</HI> was a godly Man, was said to be a true Believer in Christ, his Mother <HI>Eve</HI> was a godly Woman, there is reason also to believe that his Fa∣ther <HI>Adam</HI> repented of his Sin and found Mercy with God, but the Eldest Son in that Family was a Reprobate, he was not the Lord's chosen, namely <HI>Cain,</HI> therefore the Scripture says of him, <HI>Cain was of the wicked one</HI>; he hated his Brother for his Religion and murdered him, yet this <HI>Cain</HI> would worship God, he brought his offering to God, he was a Tiller of the Ground, he brought of the fruit of the Ground, an offering unto the Lord, he pre∣tended to Religion, and had no true Religion in him. In <HI>Abraham's</HI> Fa∣mily there was a godly <HI>Isaac</HI>; and a mocking <HI>Ishmael,</HI> that would mock at his Brother for his Piety; the Apostle says concerning him, Gal. 4.9. <HI>He that was born after the flesh, persecuted him that was born after
<PB N="41" REF="002147_0022_0FBC21EF23923B50"/>
the spirit.</HI> How did he persecute him but by scoffing and mocking at him. In <HI>Isaac's</HI> Family there was not only a <HI>Iacob,</HI> but an <HI>Esau.</HI> And when the <HI>Church</HI> became <HI>National,</HI> the Church of the Jews became National, the greatest part of that National Church were Hypocrites. <HI>Isai.</HI> 10.6. It is said God would send the Assy∣rian to punish them, that He would send him against <HI>an Hypocritical Nati∣on.</HI> 'Tis said in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22.18. Concern∣ing the house of Israel, <HI>they are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross of silver, they are brass and tin, iron and lead,</HI> not gold; It was so generally in that Nation, but few comparatively that were the Lord's chosen. Since in the days of the Gospel the <HI>Church</HI> is become <HI>Con∣gregational,</HI> particular Congregati∣ons are become Churches of God in all parts of the World. Among those there have been Sincere Professors, so also those that have been Hypo∣critical in their Profession. In the Primitive Christian Church in Je∣rusalem,
<PB N="42" REF="002147_0023_0FBC21F09DB3D220"/>
there were two notorious Hypocrites <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI>▪ Act. 5. they dyed telling a lie, it was hardly out of their mouths before God struck them dead for their wickedness; when a Church was gathered in <HI>Samaria,</HI> when <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> gathered a Church there, there were Hypocrites in that Church, and one notorious Hypocrite <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> who believed with a tempo∣rary Faith, and was thereupon Bap∣tized, yet was in the gall of bitter∣ness and in the bond of iniquity; and we find, (it is a sad truth I am going to speak to you,) we find some particular Churches in the Primitive times, that the greatest part of them were no better than Hypocrites; To the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> it is said, Rev. 3.1. <HI>Thou hast a name to live, and art dead; thou hast a few names</HI> which have not defiled their garments. So those in the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> what were they! they were a Generation of
<PB N="43" REF="002147_0023_0FBC21F09DB3D220"/>
Formalists, luke warm Christians, who provoked Christ to spue them out of his mouth, they thought sure they were good Christians, they if any Men in the World should be saved, they should: they thought they were rich, and had need of nothing; Christ said to that <HI>Church, Thou art poor, wretched, miserable, blind and naked, I counsel thee to buy of me eye salve that thou mayst see.</HI> So that in particular Churches mentioned in Scripture there have been those and many too, that have not been Sincere.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men may be of the Visible Church, yet after that they may prove total final Apostates.</HI> We see there may be such, and there has been such, 1 Joh. 2.19. <HI>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us without doubt they would have continued with us.</HI> They were only of the Church by an outward Profession, therefore went out never to return again. Such

there were in the Church of the He∣brews, Heb. 10.25. <HI>Not forsaking th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assembling of your selves together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the manner of some is</HI>; the manner of some was to joyn themselves to the Church, while they had a min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>to it, did hold</HI> communion with the Church, afterward apostatized; thus it has been with some Christi∣anized Jews, they have prov'd A∣postates; as to their Principles, so as to deny the Truth, and Funda∣mental Truths also. 2 Pet. 2.1. <HI>There shall be Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sies among you</HI>; what is an Heresy? it is a Fundamental error in Religion, when a Man de∣nies any Article of Religion necessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry to be believed in order to Salva∣tion; Thus there were some that denied the only Lord God that bought them; there were those in the Apostles days that denied Fun∣damental Truths in Religion, such there were in particular Churches, as in the Church of <HI>Pergamus,</HI> there were those that held the Doctrine
<PB N="45" REF="002147_0024_0FBC21F263E6CBC0"/>
of the <HI>Nicolaitanes,</HI> that was very Heretical, the <HI>Nicolaitanes</HI> held, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat God did not make this lower World, that it was made by An∣gels, that Men might commit Ido∣latry, &amp; not do amiss in their doing so, beside other abominable Opini∣ons they have maintained, which are not fit to be mentioned, yet there were Church-Members that did so Apostatize from the Truths of God. Some taught the <HI>Doctrine of Balaam,</HI> did teach Men as Balaam taught the Children of Israel, to eat things offered to Idols, and that Fornication was no Sin. Thus in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimitive Times, when the Apostles were yet living. Nevertheless, such did arise in particular Churches. Moreover there have been Apostates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n practice; some have returned to their old Sins again.

they return'd to those Sins they fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a time had forsaken.

what are they? poor weak crea∣tures, they cannot make an infalli∣ble judgment of others, whether they are sincere or no; they judge by outward appearance. <HI>Samuel,</HI> what a charitable judgment made he of <HI>Eliab,</HI> he thought <HI>Eliab</HI> was the Lord's Chosen, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.7. but the Lord said unto him, Look not on his countenance▪ for the Lord seeth not as Man seeth, <HI>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</HI> God knows whether there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any real work of Grace in the heart, if there be but so much as a spark of true Grace in a sea of Corruption God sees it and knows it. He knows whether the hearts of Men are set for God, for Christ, for Heaven, for the things of Eternity, or for Sin and the World; God and He only knows what is in the Heart. 1 Kin. 8.39. <HI>Thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men.</HI> Only God can pass an infallible judgment on
<PB N="48" REF="002147_0026_0FBC21F5F181EB70"/>
Men, what they are, whether they are sincere or no: Men must judge charitably, it is better to judge as Hypocrite to be a Child of God, than to condemn a Child of God for an Hypocrite, therefore they ought to judge charitably, because they are weak creatures that cannot see into the Hearts of Men, there∣fore they may easily admit those that are not fit to be among them. And Officers in Churches may be to blame. There is a Scripture in Eze∣kiel that refers to Gospel times, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ek.</HI> 44.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. it is spoken in way of reproof to those that were Officers, <HI>Ye have brought into my sanctuary those that are uncircumcised in heart.</HI> The Church of God is a Sanctuary, Officers in a Church may bring into God's Sanctuary those that are not circumcised in heart, that are not regenerate, that have not experien∣ced a work of Grace changing of them, making them new Creatures, and giving them new Hearts, Officers

should be careful of bringing such as are not so into the Lord's Sanctu∣ary, but many times they are not so careful as they should be; then Churches will be full of Hypocrites, as is said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> concerning the Tares, <HI>when Men slept,</HI> then the Tares sprang up; when the Watch∣men are not so watchful as they should be, then Tares <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring up in Churches.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are some Hypocrites that in all outward appearance are the Children of God.</HI> They do just like the Children of God; they resemble them very much, so as that others are deceived by them; they come <HI>privily</HI> into Churches and <HI>unawares,</HI> before Churches are aware of them they get in among them, it may be a great number of them too. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.4. it is said <HI>False Brethren</HI> crept in among them; and who were those False Brethren do you think?

The Hypo∣crite is no better than a Wolf, why will the Church receive such among them? why the reason is this, they are in Sheeps cloathing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.15.

Christ said to the Pharisees who were Hypo∣crites, Mat. 23.27. <HI>Ye are like unto whited sepulchres which appear beau∣tiful outwardly, but within are full of dead mens bones,</HI> so ye appear righ∣teous to Men, but within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Thus Hypocrites have a name to live, a form of Godliness, therefore they are thought to be Godly, they make the same Profession as the truly

Tares are very like the Wheat▪ Natura∣lists observe, <HI>Lolia est spuria tricici species,</HI> Tares are a bastard kind of Wheat.

For Answer, There are some refined Hypocrites that is a hard matter to know them, it is impossible for Men to know them, they are lookt upon as the precious Servants of God, the dear Servants of God, those acquainted with them, take them to be so; without doubt <HI>Iudas</HI> was such an one, the Apostles were not jealous of him; when Christ told them to their amazement that one of them should betray him, they cryed out, one and another, <HI>Lord is it I?</HI> Peter said, <HI>Lord is it I?</HI> John said, <HI>Lord is it I?</HI> not one of them said, Lord is it Judas? they lookt upon Judas as an eminent Servant of God.

Thus <HI>Absal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> discovered himself to be an Hypo∣crite, he pretended to Religion, when it was not so really, he comes to his Father, says he, when I was in <HI>He∣bron</HI> I made a Vow to God, that if he would bring me again to Jerusa∣lem, I would serve Him, therefore let me go that I may perform my Vow, his good Father bids him go in peace, whereas Absalom's design was not to perform his Vow, but to rebel and make himself King.

which his life would be taken away, then his Estate forfeited to the King; this must be covered with a mock Fast, to Pray, that Sin might not be imputed to the Land.

that indulge themselves in any Sin are no better than Hypocrites, yet there have been such in Churches, Ah and in Churches in <HI>New-England too,</HI> Men that have been thought to be very pious Men, yet afterward appeared to have lived in Adultery or in Fornication.

<P>WE proceed to the Third Doctrine that has been mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>That the Lord's Chosen are but Few.</HI></P>
<P>For clearing the Truth Two Things are to be attended. First, To show how this is to be under∣stood, that the Lord's Chosen are but few. Secondly, To mention some Things which are Demonstra∣tions of the Truth before us. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How is this to be understood, that the Lord's Chosen are but few.</HI> For Answer, It is to be understood not in an absolute but in a compa∣rative sense, for it is a Truth that the Lord has chosen many, many Hundreds, many Thousands, many Ten Thousands, to be the Objects of His Love, and of His Salvation. Our Saviour Christ when He did

institute that Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, He declared that His Blood was <HI>shed for many,</HI> Mat. 26.28. therefore the Lord's Chosen are many. It is said of Abraham, that his Children should be as the Stars of Heaven that could not be num∣bred, which is to be understood es∣pecially concerning his spiritual Children, namely Believers, who are said to be his Children, He is said to be the Father of the Faith∣ful. The like promise is made con∣cerning David, <HI>Ier.</HI> 33.22. that God would multiply his Seed, that they should be even as the Stars of Hea∣ven. <HI>Christ</HI> is the <HI>David</HI> there in∣tended, so that Believers shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as the Stars of Heaven, yea as the Sand on the Sea shore, a great num∣ber in themselves considered. <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.9. it is said, <HI>There was a great multitude which no man could number</HI> of all Nations, and People, and Tongues, that had white Robes given to them: So then it is in a
<PB N="70" REF="002147_0037_0FBC2208EBAF0390"/>
<HI>comparative sense,</HI> that the Lord's Chosen are but few, namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. Compared with the rest of the World, so they are but Few. Rom. 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. <HI>The Election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded.</HI> The whole World is divided into <HI>the Election,</HI> and <HI>the rest.</HI> Now the Election are but few compared with the rest of the World, therefore they are said to be but a <HI>Remnant,</HI> ver. 5. <HI>A rem∣nant according to Election.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They are but Few compared with those that have the Gospel offered unto them, that have the Call of the Gospel, the Word of God vouchsafed to them, few com∣pared with them that enjoy the Means of Grace; thus has it been all along in all Ages of the World, it was thus in the Old World, there were many had the Word of God dispensed to them, who yet were not of the Lord's Chosen; thus for the Sinners of the Old World, it is said of them, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.19. that Christ

of Israel, to the whole Nation of Israel, yet they were not many of them Chosen, Jer. 6.30. <HI>Reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejcted them.</HI> Thus it was in the days of the Apostles, they Preached the Gospel to the Jewish N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, yet they made light of it, did not accept it. Thus it was when our Saviour Himself appeared in the World, He Preached the Gospel to many who were not the Lord's Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sen, but did reject and refuse the Grace which was offered to them by Christ. Joh. 8.47. <HI>You hear not my words</HI> says Christ, <HI>because ye are not of God,</HI> he that is of God heareth God's words. Christ said to them, ye believe not because <HI>ye are not of my Sheep.</HI> Christ Preach'd the Word to them, they had the best Means ever People in this World had, for all that they were not Sheep, they were not the Lord's Chosen. So we see the Lord's Chosen are but few comparatively, compared
<PB N="73" REF="002147_0038_0FBC220A1DFFCB58"/>
with the rest of the World, and compared with those that have the outward Means of Grace vouch∣safed to them; <HI>Who has believed our report,</HI> says the Prophet. There are but few true Believers, so but few Chosen among those that have the report of the Gospel brought unto them. But how does this appear?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We shall mention some Demonstrations of it.</P>
<P>Demon. 1. <HI>It is evident in that those that enjoy the Means of Grace are but few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompared with the rest of the World.</HI> For many Generations only one Nation on the face of the Earth had the Word of God vouch∣safed to them; so the Israelitish Nation, Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He shewed his word unto Iacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel, he hath not dealt so with any nation.</HI> He did not send Prophets, Ministers to Prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Word of God to them, so as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that People. Amos. 3.2. <HI>You only have I known of all the families of the
<PB N="74" REF="002147_0039_0FBC220CEF6E1700"/>
Earth.</HI> No other Nation had the Gospel sent to them, and to them God did write the great things of His Law, they only had the Scrip∣tures the written Word of God a∣mong them. Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>What ad∣vantage hath the Iew above the Gen∣tile, much every way,</HI> says the A∣postle, <HI>chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</HI> Therefore Christ said to the Woman of Samari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Joh. 4.22. <HI>Salvation is of the Iews,</HI> that is, only they that had the true worship of God among them; all other Nations had not the Means of Salvation. Men must have been either Jews by birth, or proselyted to that Religion, or they could not be saved. Salvation is of the Jews; so then if there be but few comparatively have the Means of Salvation, and among these very great multitudes that are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord's Chosen, we must hence con∣clude there are but few that are the Lord's Chosen.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="75" REF="002147_0039_0FBC220CEF6E1700"/>2. <HI>The Scripture does plainly in∣timate this Truth.</HI> In the Scripture there are two ways spoken of, and every Man that hears me this day, nay every Man in the whole World at this day, is in one of those two ways, either in the broad way, or the narrow way, there is a broad way, there are great multitudes going in that way, that way leads to destruction; as for the narrow way there are but few in that, <HI>Few there be that find it.</HI> Therefore also does the Scripture say, Luk. 12.32. that the Lord's Chosen are <HI>a little Flock, Fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom</HI>; that is to say, you are Chosen of God, Ah but you are a Little Flock. The Original Word is <HI>Micron Poimnion, A Little, Little Flock indeed</HI>; so are the Lord's Chosen. The Israelitish Nation was a Type of the Elect of God, there∣fore are they called by the name of Israel, Gal. 6.16. <HI>Peace be upon the
<PB N="76" REF="002147_0040_0FBC220DE2B8F250"/>
Israel of God.</HI> The Lord's Chosen are the Israel of God; now they were but a small Nation comparatively. <HI>Deut.</HI> 7.7. The Lord did not choose you because ye were more in num∣ber than any people, <HI>for ye were the fewest of all people</HI>; so they were a Type of the Lord's Chosen in that respect.</P>
<P>Demon. 3. <HI>Such Things are to be affirmed of the Lord's Chosen as can∣not be said of many.</HI> First, it is said of those that are the Lord's Chosen that they are or shall be Believers on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>Unto you that believe he is precious.</HI> ver. 9. <HI>Ye are a chosen generation.</HI> They that are the Chosen Generation are or shall be Believers on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Scripture speaks of <HI>the faith of God's Elect,</HI> Tit. 1.1. So that the Elect of God either have or shall have Faith. Many of them have Faith already; there are many also of the Elect that have not Faith
<PB N="77" REF="002147_0040_0FBC220DE2B8F250"/>
now but they shall have Faith in God's time, Joh. 10.16. <HI>I have other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heep which are not of this fold, and they shall hear my voice</HI>; they that are Sheep, that are the Lord's Cho∣sen they shall hear the voice of Christ, they shall be made Belie∣vers on His Name, Act. 13.48. <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed,</HI> if there is an ordination to Eternal Life, if there is a choosing▪ there shall be a believing; the A∣postle says, <HI>whom he predestinated, them he also called,</HI> if there is a predestination there will follow an effectual calling, which is the same with believing in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ▪ now there are but few in the World that do, or that ever wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but perish in their unbelie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ even those Christ Himself did Preach to and wrought Miracles amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them, <HI>tho' he wrought such Miracles they did not believe,</HI> Isai. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath believed our re∣port,
<PB N="78" REF="002147_0041_0FBC220F84667AE8"/>
and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed</HI>: and it is said, Luk. 18.8. <HI>When the son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth.</HI> If Christ should come to judge the World this very Week He would find but little Faith on the Earth, He would find comparatively but few Believers on the face of the Earth, so it is like to be as long as this World shall last. Secondly, The Lord's Chosen shall have Re∣pentance given to them, they shall be humbled for their Sins, the House of Israel shall have a new Heart given to them. Ephraim was a Type of the Lord's Chosen, and the Lord says, Jer. 31.18. <HI>I have heard Ephraim bem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aning himself,</HI> turn thou me and I shall be turned; he was become a Penitent, mourned for his Sins, not only so but did for∣sake his Sins with an utter detesta∣tion. Hos. 14.8. <HI>Ephraim shall say, what have I to do any more with Idols,</HI> no more, never any thing more to
<PB N="79" REF="002147_0041_0FBC220F84667AE8"/>
do with Idols; so they that are the Lord's Chosen shall be true Peni∣tents, this is true but of a few com∣paratively; look over the World there are but few such to be found, it is, as was in <HI>Ieremiahs</HI> time, I hearkened and heard, <HI>no man re∣pented saying, what have I done</HI>; no man, that is very few comparative∣ly. Thirdly, <HI>As for the Lord's Cho∣sen they shall be holy.</HI> Eph. 1.4. He hath chosen us that we should be holy. If the Lord has chosen, there will certainly holiness follow. Heb. 3.1. <HI>Holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling</HI>; they that are par∣takers of the Heavenly Calling, are Holy Brethren; there are but few comparatively▪ that are holy ones. Psal. 12.1. <HI>The godly man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ceaseth from among the children of men.</HI> Prov. 20.6. <HI>A faithful man who can find.</HI> A Man that is faithful to God, and to His Interest who can find, there are but few such to be found in the whole World comparatively; then
<PB N="80" REF="002147_0042_0FBC221111C20D10"/>
we must conclude the Lord's Cho∣sen are but few. The World ge∣nerally is an ungodly World, as the Old World is styled <HI>the World of the ungodly</HI>: and truly the same Epithet belongs to it still as to the gene∣rallity of it. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.</HI> Who is the God of this World? The Devil the destroyer of Souls is the God of this World. Then we must con∣clude there are but few that are the Lord's Chosen. Lastly, The Lord's Chosen shall have Eternal Life given to them. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27. There Names are written in the Lambs Book of Life; they then shall have Life given to them: Those God has chosen he has a Book of Life and every one of their Names are written there, therefore they shall have Eternal Life given to them. 2 Thes. 2.13. <HI>God hath from the beginning chosen you to Sal∣vation, through sanctification of the

Secondly, Observe they shall certainly have Salvation▪ Eternal Salvation, <HI>He has chosen them to Salvation.</HI> Thirdly, That they shall be <HI>Sanctified,</HI> fitted to en∣joy that Eternal Salvation, there∣fore they shall be Believers, for it is by Faith they come to be sancti∣fyed: But now this is true but of Few comparatively, but they shall have these things conferred on them. There was a Man that pro∣posed that Question to our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Are there few that shall be saved,</HI> Luk. 13.23. Observe now what Christ's answer was, ver. 24. <HI>Strait is the gate that leads to life, and many will seek to enter, and shall not be able.</HI> Then, how few are like to be saved; if the Gate be strait, and many seekers shall not enter in▪
<PB N="82" REF="002147_0043_0FBC2212DF78EA50"/>
Certainly there are but a few▪ that will enter into the Gate of Life, of Salvation. We see from these Par∣ticulars the Doctrine clear'd. For the Improvement of it.</P>
<P>USE. I. We may here see the Erroneousness of several Opinions that some have taken up: As now that opposition of <HI>Universal Re∣demption,</HI> that Christ has died to save all Men whatsoever, if that were true, my Doctrine would not be true, that few are Chosen, for Christ's Redemption, and the E∣lection of God run Parallel, Christ died to redeem only those, and all those God has given to Him, and they are the Objects of His special Love. Christ says, Joh. 15.13. <HI>Grea∣ter love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.</HI> Those Christ has laid down his life for, are the objects of His special peculiar love. Can any one think that <HI>Christ</HI> loved <HI>Iudas</HI> as much as
<PB N="83" REF="002147_0043_0FBC2212DF78EA50"/>
He loved <HI>Peter?</HI> Yet it must be so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f he died for Judas's Salvation as much as He did for Peter's. If this be so, then Christ's Death has been in vain as to a great part of those whom he died for, which may not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e imagined. Gal. 2.21. says the Apostle, <HI>If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain,</HI> which may not be imagined. Thus if Christ dyed for all Men, for those whom the Lord has not cho∣sen, then He died in vain for a very great part of the World, but we must not imagine this. We find in Scripture Christ would not so much as Pray for the Reprobate World. Joh. 17.9. <HI>I pray for them which thou hast given me,</HI> says Christ, <HI>I pray not for the world</HI>: But has Christ died for that World, which He would not so much as once Pray and plead with God for the Salva∣tion of? Not but that there is a sufficiency of Merit in the Death, in the Blood of Christ, to save all
<PB N="84" REF="002147_0044_0FBC2213DCE70858"/>
the World, nay Merit enough to save ten thousand Worlds, the Blood of Christ has infinite Merit in it, it must needs be so, because it is the <HI>Blood of God,</HI> the Scripture so calls it, <HI>Acts.</HI> 20.28. <HI>God has purchased his Church with his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood;</HI> the Blood of God must needs have infinite Vertue and Va∣lue in it. The Life of God was given for the Redemption of those that were given to Christ. 1 Joh. 3.16. <HI>God has laid down hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> life for us.</HI> Hence there is an infinite Va∣lue in the Blood of Christ, but all Men whatsoever are not the Ob∣jects of His Redemption, He did not design His Blood should be shed for to make Atonement for the Sins of every one, but only for the Elect of God, His Chosen that He has given to Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ror falls under confutation here, <HI>That Men may be saved in any Religion, if they be but true to the Principles of their

own Religion.</HI> But this cannot be, for the greatest part of the World what is their Religion? Their Re∣ligion is Idolatry, that is a Reli∣gion that will nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> save any Man that shall embrace it. Psal. 97.7. <HI>Confounded be all they that serve grave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> images, that boast themselves of idols.</HI> Not Salvation but Confu∣sion is pronounced to such as are worshippers of Idols, and the great∣est part of the World have been, and inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d are so at this day▪ What shall be said of <HI>Mahometans</HI> and of their Religion; the best Interpre∣ters conceive that Scripture is meant of them, Rev. 9.11. <HI>They had a King over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek Apollyon.</HI> Abaddon signi∣fies destruction, so does Apollyon. Those miserable wretches that fill a very great part of the World at this day, the King over them is the Angel of the bottomless Pit, are
<PB N="86" REF="002147_0045_0FBC2217056800B0"/>
they like to be saved then? What shall we say of those that embrace the Jewish Religion, a Man cannot be saved if he is of that Religion, Christ Himself declares it, Joh. 8.24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ye shall die in your sins:</HI> If ye believe not that I am the true Messiah that God promised to send into the World, you shall die in your Sins, that is to say you shall certainly be Damned, yet the miserable Jews do not believe this, so far are they from believing it, that they blas∣pheme Christ in their Synagogues, they curse the blessed Name of <HI>Ie∣sus,</HI> they wish that Name may be rooted out of the World. What shall we say of a great number of those that call themselves Christi∣ans. Papists, are they in the way to Salvation? they are Idolaters: in∣deed they don't worship <HI>Iupiter,</HI> and <HI>Diana,</HI> but they worship <HI>Peter,</HI> and the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> which is as great Idolatry as if they worshipp'd

<HI>Iupiter,</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> That Judicious Divine Famous Mr. <HI>Perkins,</HI> wrote a Treatise ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Years since in which he proves, That a <HI>Papist liv∣ing up to the Principles of his Reli∣gion cannot possibly go beyond a Re∣probate.</HI> Doubtless the Apostle Paul Prophecied of them, 2 Thes. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.10, 11. <HI>That there would come Men into the world, who would prove apostates,</HI> and would provoke God by not believing the Truth, that He would give them up to strong delusions, that they should believe a lie, that they might be damned, who be∣lieved not the truth.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>It is not safe always to follow the Multitude,</HI> to do as many do, or as the most do. It is said, Rev. 13.3. <HI>All the world wondered after the beast.</HI> So then we must not do as the greatest part of the World do. Men are exceeding apt to do so. If there be many do this or that, if there is a proud
<PB N="88" REF="002147_0046_0FBC22186531B698"/>
foolish fashion, if many take it up, others take it up, and think they do well, Why? every Body does it; But what says the Scripture, Exod. 23.2. <HI>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</HI> What though a multitude practise it, if the thing is evil it may not be followed, the Scripture says, <HI>Conform not your selves to this world,</HI> but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Christians must be singular Persons, it be∣comes them to have an holy singularity, they may not do as others do. 1 Thes. 5.6. <HI>Let us not sleep as do others,</HI> but let us watch and be sober; They were to be singular, to go beyond others. Christ therefore said to His Dis∣ciples, <HI>What do ye more than others?</HI> It is said to the Church of Sardis, Rev. 3.4. <HI>Thou hast a few names which have not defiled their garments.</HI> Well then, Christians should be and do even as a few, and not
<PB N="89" REF="002147_0046_0FBC22186531B698"/>
follow a multitude. We find the Eminent Servants of God have been singular. <HI>Noah</HI> in his time, <HI>Gen.</HI> 7.1. God says to him, <HI>I have seen thee righteous before me in this Generation.</HI> He differed from the whole Generation he lived in, he served God faithfully, did as but few did, so God did for him as He did but for few. The Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> was a singu∣lar Man, 1 Kin. 19.10. says he, <HI>The children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine Altars, they have worshipped Baal, and I only am left.</HI> Indeed there were seven thousand which he did not know of, Godly ones, that had not bowed their knee to Baal; but that was but a very small number comparatively among that People, who could loose Five Hundred Thousands in one Battel. <HI>Lot,</HI> he also was a singular Man, he was vexed with the ungodly conversation of the wicked. It was
<PB N="90" REF="002147_0047_0FBC2219F16D2708"/>
a fore grief and trouble to him, there was not such a Man as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be found, in Five whole Cities there were not Ten such Men to be found; if there had, those Ci∣ties would not have been destroy∣ed. <HI>Ioshua</HI> the Priest was a singu∣lar Man. Zech. 3.8. The Lord said unto him, <HI>Thou and thy Fel∣lows are Men wondred at.</HI> What were they wondred at for? For their Piety, for their Courage and Zeal, that they would venture to build the Temple of God, when all the World was set a∣gainst them. Then it becomes Christians not to follow the Mul∣titude, but to be and do as but very few in the World do.</P>
<P>USE. III. <HI>If there be but few that are the Lord's Chosen, they that are of those few what cause have they to be thankful, to be blessing and prai∣sing of God.</HI> If we see marks and signs of Election in others, we
<PB N="91" REF="002147_0047_0FBC2219F16D2708"/>
ought to bless God for them, as the Apostle did for his Thessaloni∣ans, 1 Thes. 1.2, 4. <HI>We give thanks to God for you, knowing Brethren your Election of God.</HI> They knew it only by a judgment of charity, they saw that in them that was a sign of their being God's Chosen. Much more they that have a judg∣ment of infallability concerning their own being the Chosen of God, ought to be exceedingly thankful, in that this Choice proceeds purely from the Grace of God. Deut. 7.8. <HI>God has loved you, because he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved you</HI>: so he chooses them, because he chooses them, without any work of theirs, without regard to any desert of theirs, He chooses them from His Sovereign Grace, therefore they ought to be the more thankful. As for the Elect of God themselves, they are by Nature no better than the vilest Reprobates that lives on the face of the Earth, they are
<PB N="92" REF="002147_0048_0FBC221B5CE09018"/>
<HI>Children of Wrath</HI> even as others, they are guilty of Adam's Sin, guilty of Original Sin, they bring Original Sin into the World with them, and they are guilty of Actual Sins, <HI>We were sometimes disobedient,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>even as others.</HI> It may be more guil∣ty, guilty of many more Actual Sins than others. Some of them have been so; as now, <HI>Paul</HI> what a Sinner had he been, he con∣fesses that he had been the chief of Sinners, he persecuted the Saints of God, he consented to the Blood of the Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> and when God bid <HI>Ananias</HI> go to him and comfort him when in the pangs of the New Birth, says <HI>Ananias, Lord, I have heard of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Ierusalem,</HI> but the Lord said to him, go thy way for he is <HI>a chosen Vessel</HI> unto me. It is then from Grace that God is pleased to choose any of the
<PB N="93" REF="002147_0048_0FBC221B5CE09018"/>
Children of Men: Then they that are Chosen ought to bless God. There is no cause of it but the free Sovereign Grace of God. In∣deed Christ is the cause of Sal∣vation, the meritorious cause, but we cannot say Christ Himself is the cause of Election, for Christ Himself is an Elect Vessel, the Head of the Elect World. So then there is no cause of E∣lection but only the free love of God, who <HI>will be gracious because he will be gracious, and will shew mercy to whom he will shew mercy.</HI> Therefore the Elect of God ought to be exceeding thankful unto Him. If there is Election most certainly Salvation will follow, no Elect Soul shall ever miscar∣ry, it is said of some they shall deceive <HI>if it were possible, the very Elect,</HI> but that is impossible that an Elect Vessel should be deceiv∣ed so as to become an Apostate from God, though others may
<PB N="94" REF="002147_0049_0FBC221EC010C4F8"/>
that have made a great Profession, and the People they lived among did think surely they were Good Men, they may fall away, be∣come Apostates, but those that belong to Election it is impossible any such should miscarry as to their Eternal Salvation, this you ought to be thankful for; Yes, you will say, <HI>If we knew we were of that Number.</HI> The Scripture tells you how you may know it, it is known by one thing, and but by one thing, <HI>viz.</HI> your Effectual Calling. 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</HI> Would you be sure of your Election, then make sure you are Effectually Called, and my Life for thine, thou shalt go to Heaven when thou diest; make sure of true Faith in Christ. Says Christ, <HI>My Sheep,</HI> that is to say, the Lord's Chosen, <HI>they hear my voice and follow me,</HI> Joh. 10.17. Shepherds among us they drive
<PB N="95" REF="002147_0049_0FBC221EC010C4F8"/>
their Sheep before them, but it was not so in the Eastern Na∣tions, their Sheep followed them, they knew the Voice of their Shepherds and followed them. Do you hear the Voice of Christ and follow Him? Do you fol∣low the Lamb whithersoever He goes? Then you may be sure of it, you are Christ's Sheep, that Christ has died for you, that you are of the Chosen of God. Then there is another Use, I am loth to mention it, it is a dread∣ful one, but I must do it, God has commanded me to do it, and that I should this Day do it, in this Congregation.</P>
<P>USE. IV. <HI>Hence then it is certain that the greatest part of the Chil∣dren of Men will perish Eternally.</HI> And how dismal is that to think of, yet so it is. I remember I have heard of a Man that was possest of a Devil, and he uttered
<PB N="96" REF="002147_0050_0FBCBDCA53C6BA98"/>
such words as these, I know said the Devil in that Man, I know that in the Day of Judgment I shall have more to be with me than Christ will have to be with Him. How awfully does the Scripture speak, Joel. 3.14. <HI>Mul∣titudes,</HI> where are they, Lord, where are they? O they are <HI>in the valley of decision,</HI> in the valley of slaughter, there they are. Psal. 9.17. <HI>The wicked, and all the nati∣ons that forget God, shall be turned into Hell</HI>; is not that a terri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Scripture, all the Nations that forget God, whole Nations are at once going down into Hell. There are whole Nations that have no means of Grace, they sit in darkness and see no light.
