<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Containing the Occurrences of the first Year.</HEAD>
<P>ON the second Day of <HI>August, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of the taking the Family of <HI>Thomas Gyles,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></NOTE> Anno Christi</HI> 1689, in the Morning, my honoured Father <HI>Thomas Gyles,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> went with some Labourers, my two Elder Brothers and my self, to one of his Farms, which lay on the River about three Miles above <HI>Fort-Charles</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fort-Charles</HI> stood on the Spot where <HI>Frederick's Fort</HI> was, not long since, founded the Hon Col.DUNBAR: The Township adjoining thereto was called <HI>James Town,</HI> in honour to the Duke of <HI>York:</HI> In this Town with∣in a quarter of a Mile of the Fort was the Dwelling House of <HI>Thomas Gyles,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> from which he went out that unhappy Morning.</NOTE>, adjoining to <HI>Pemmaquid Falls;</HI> there to ga∣ther in his English Harvest, and laboured securely till Noon. But after we had Dined, our People went to their Labour, some in one Field to their English Hay, the others to another

Field of English Corn, except my Father, the youngest of my two Brothers and my self, who tarried near to the Farm-House in which we had Dined, till about One of the Clock, when we heard the Report of several Great Guns from the Fort. Upon the hearing of them my Father said, that he hop'd it was a Signal of good News, and that the Great Council had sent back the Soldiers, to cover the Inhabi∣tants: for on Report of the Revolution they had deserted: But to our great Surprize about Thirty or Forty Indians dis∣charged a Volley of Shot at us, from behind a rising Ground near our Barn. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indians have a Custom of uttering a most horrid Howl, when they discharge Guns, designing thereby to terrify those whom they fight against.</NOTE> The Yelling of the Indians, the Whistling of their Shot, and the Voice of my Father, whom I heard cry out, What now! What now! so terrified me; tho' he seem'd to be handling a Gun, that I endeavoured to make my Escape. My Brother ran one way and I ano∣ther; and looking over my Shoulder, I saw a stout Fellow, painted, pursuing me with a Gun; and a Curtlass glitter∣ing in his Hand, which I expected every Moment in my Brains: I presently fell down, and the Indian took me by the Left Hand, offered me no abuse, but seized my Arms, lift me up, and pointed to the Place where the People were at Work about the Hay; and lead me that way. As we passed, we crossed my Father, who looked very pale and bloody, and walked very slowly. When we came to the Place, I saw two Men shot down on the Flatts, and one or two more knock'd on the Head with Hatchets, crying out, O Lord, &amp;c! there the Indians brought two Captives, one Man, and my Brother <HI>James,</HI> he that endeavoured to escape by running from the House, when I did <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was about Fourteen Years of Age. The eldest Brother whose Name was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> wonderfully escaped by Land to the <HI>Barbacan</HI> (a Point of Land on the West Side of the River opposite to the Fort,) where several Fishing vessels lay, he got on board one of them and came to Sail that Night.</NOTE> After they had done what Mischief they could, sat down, making us sit with them: and after some time arose, pointing to us to go Eastward. They march'd about a quarter of a Mile and then made a Halt, and brought my Father to us: and made Proposals to him by old <HI>Moxus,</HI> who told him that
<PB N="3" REF="004021_0006_1003B0E1CD5E0710"/>
they were strange Indians who shot him, and that he was sorry for it: My Father replied, that he was a dying Man, and wanted no Favour of them, but to Pray with his Children; which being granted, he recommended us to the Protection and Blessing of GOD Almighty; then gave us the best Advice, and took his leave for this Life, hoping in GOD that we should meet in a better. He parted with a chearful Voice, but looked very pale by reason of his great loss of Blood, which boil'd out of his Shoes:—the Indi∣ans lead him aside—!—I heard the blows of the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher, but neither Shriek nor Groan! [I afterwards heard that he had five or seven Shot-holes, thro' his Wastecoat or Jacket, and that the Indians covered him with some Boughs]</P>
<P>The Indians lead us their Captives, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. Of their ta∣king <HI>Pemma∣quid</HI> Town and Fort.</NOTE> on the East side of the River, toward the Fort; and when we came within a Mile and half of the Fort and Town, and could see the Fort, we saw Firing &amp; Smoke on all sides: Here we made a short stop, and then we moved within or near the distance of three quarters of a Mile from the Fort, <NOTE PLACE="marg">—Of <HI>Mr. Gyles's</HI> Fami∣ly in particu∣lar.</NOTE> into a thick Swamp. There I saw my Mother and my two little Sisters, and many other Captives taken from the Town. My Mother ask'd me of my Father, I told her, that he was kill'd, but could say no more for Grief; she burst into Tears, and the Indi∣ans moved me a little further off, and seiz'd me to a Tree.</P>
<P>The Indians came to <HI>New-Harbour,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">—Of the Town and Fort in ge∣neral.</NOTE> and sent Spies several Days to observe how and where the People were employed &amp;c. who found that the Men were generally at Work at Noon, and left about their Houses only Women and Children: therefore the Indians divided themselves into several Parties, some Ambushing the Way between the Fort and the Houses, as likewise between them and the distant Fields; and then alarming the farthest off first, they kill'd and took the People, as they moved toward the Town and Fort, at their Pleasure; so that very few escaped to the Fort. Mr. <HI>Pateshall</HI> was taken and kill'd as he lay with his Sloop near the <HI>Barbican.</HI> On the first stir about the Fort my youngest Brother was at Play near the same, and ran in, and so by God's Goodness was preserved. Capt. <HI>Weems</HI> with great Courage &amp; Resolution defended the wrak

old Fort two Days, till that he was much Wounded and the best of his Men Kill'd, and then Beat up a Parley. And the Conditions were,</P>
<P N="1">1. That they, the Indians should give him Mr. <HI>Poteshall's</HI> Sloop.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they should not molest him in carrying off the few People that had got into the Fort, and three Captives that they had taken.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the English should carry off in their Hands what they could from the Fort.</P>
<P>On these Conditions the Fort was Surrendred, and Capt. <HI>Weems</HI> went off. And soon after the Indians set on Fire the Fort &amp; Houses: which made a terrible Blast, and was a me∣lancholly Sight to us poor Captives, who were sad Spectators!</P>
<P>After the Indians had thus laid Waste <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III.

Before the War there were about twelve Houses, but the rumour of War, disposed them to secure themselves, by forsaking their Habitations.</NOTE>. And when we turned out Backs on the Town my Heart was ready to break!—I saw my Mother; she spake to me, but I could not answer her! That Night we tarried at <HI>New-Harbour,</HI> and the next Day went in their Canoes for <HI>Penobscot.</HI> About Noon, the Canoe which my Mother, and that which I was in, came side by side; whether accidental or by my Mother's desire, I can∣not say. She asked me, How I did? I think I said, Pretty well, (tho' my Heart was full of Grief). Then she said, O, my Child! how joyful &amp; pleasant would it be, if we were going to <HI>Old England,</HI> to see your Uncle <HI>Chalker,</HI> and other Friends there?—Poor Babe! we are going into the Wil∣derness, the Lord knows where!—She burst into Tears, and the Canoes parted! That Night following the Indians with their Captives lodged on an Island. A few days after, we arrived at <HI>Penobscot-Fort;</HI> where I again saw my Mo∣ther, my Brother and Sisters, and many other Captives. I think, we tarried here eight Days: and in that time the Jesuit had a great mind to buy me. My Indian Master
<PB N="5" REF="004021_0008_1003CC316B908AC8"/>
made a Visit to the Jesuit, and carried me with him <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Indian that takes and will keep a Captive is accounted his Master, and the Captive his Property till he give or sell him to another.</NOTE> I saw the Jesuit shew him Pieces of Gold, and understood af∣terward, that he tendered them for me. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesuit gave me a Bisket, which I put into my Pocket, and dare not eat; but buried it under a Log, fearing that he had put something in it to make me Love him: for I was very Young, and had heard much of the Papists torturing the Protestants &amp;c. so that I hated the sight of a Jesuit. When my Mother heard the talk of my being Sold to a Jesuit, she said to me, Oh! my dear Child! if it were GOD's Will, I had rather follow you to your Grave! or never see you more in this World, than you should be Sold to a Jesuit: for a Jesuit will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in you Body &amp; Soul! and it pleased GOD to grant her Request, for she never saw me more!

At Home I had ever seen Strangers treat∣ed with the utmost Civility, and being a Stranger, I ex∣pected some kind Treatment here: but soon found my self deceived, for I presently saw a Number of Squaws got to∣gether in a Circle dancing and yelling; and an old gri∣mace-Squaw took me by the Hand, and lead me to the Ring, where the other Squaws seiz'd me by the Hair of my Head, and by my Hands and Feet, like so many Furies: but my Indian Master presently laid down a Pledge and releas'd me. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cus∣tom of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cap∣tives, and of redeeming them from A∣buses at Dan∣ces.</NOTE> A Captive among the Indians is exposed to all manner of Abuse, and to the utmost Tortures; unless his Master, or some of his Master's Relations, lay down a Ransom, such as a Bag of Corn, or a Blanket, or such like: by which they may redeem them from their Cruelties for that Dance, so that he shall not be touch'd by any.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004021_0009_1003CC3571D9C7A0"/>The next Day we went up that Eastern Branch of <HI>Penobs∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t River</HI> many Leagues,—carried over Land to a large Pond, and from one Pond to another, till, in a few Days we went down a River <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medocktack River.</HI></NOTE>, which vents it self into <HI>St. John's River.</HI> But before we came to the Mouth of this River, we carried over a long Carrying-Place <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A Carrying-Place is a Path or Track in which they pass from one River, or part of a River or Pond to another: 'tis so called, because the Indians are obliged to carry their Baggage over them.</NOTE> to <HI>Medoctack-Fort,</HI> which stands on a Bank of <HI>St. John's River.</HI> My Indian Master went before, and left me with an old Indian and two or three Squaws.

<P>After some Miles travel we came in sight of a large Corn∣Field, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. V.

I have heard the Indians say at a Feast, that there being a Truce for some Days, they contriv'd to send in two Squaws to take No∣tice of the Numbers, Lodgings and other Circumstances of the People in his Garrison, and if they could obtain leave to Lodge there, to open the Gates and Whistle. [They said the Gates had no Locks, but were fastned with Pins, and that they kept no Watch there] The Squaws had a favourable Season to prosecute their Projection, for it was dull Weather when they came, and begg'd leave to Lodge in the Garrison: they told the Major that a great Number of Indians were not far from them, with considerable Quantities of Beaver, who would Trade with him the next Day &amp;c. Some of the People were very much against their Lodging in the Garrison, but the Major said, Let the poor Crea∣tures Lodge by the Fire! The Squaws went into every Apartment, and observed the Numbers in each, and when the People were all asleep, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose and opened the Gates, and gave the Signal, and the other Indians came to them, and having receiv'd an Account of the State of the Garrison, they divided according to the Number of People in each A∣partment, and soon took and kill'd them all. The Major lodged within an inner Room, and when the Indians broke in upon him, he cried out, What now! What now! jumpt out of Bed in his Shirt, and drave them out with his sword thro' two or three Doors: and as he was re∣turning to his Apartment, an Indian came behind him, and knock'd him on the Head with his Hatchet, stun'd him, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him out, and set him upon a long Table in his Hall, and bid him, Judge Indians again. Then they eat and stab'd him, and he cry'd out, O Lord! O Lord!—They bid him order his Book of Accompts to be brought, and cross out all the Indian Debts (for he had traded much with the Indians) and after they had tortured him to Death, they burned the Garrison and drew off. This Narration I heard from their Mouths at a general Meeting; and have Reason to think it true. And it should be a Warning to all Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who have the Care of Garrisons: For the greatest Los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es we meet with are for want of due Caution and Circumst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE>. I was whirl'd in
<PB N="7" REF="004021_0010_1003CC3B72D02DC0"/>
among them, and we look'd on each other with a sorrowful Countenance: and presently one of them was seiz'd by each Hand &amp; Foot, by four Indians, who swung him up and let his Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Force fall on the hard Ground, 'till they had dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d (as they call it) round the whole Wig∣wam, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of tor∣menting Cap∣tives.</NOTE> which was thirty or forty Feet in length. But when they torture a Boy, they take him up between two. This is one of their Customs of torturing Captives. Ano∣ther is to take up a Person by the middle with his Head downwards, and jolt him round 'till one would think his Bowels would shake out of his Mouth. Sometimes they will take a Captive by the Hair of the Head and stoop him forward, and strike him on the Back &amp; Shoulder, 'till the Blood gush out of his Mouth &amp; Nose. Sometimes an old shrivell'd Squaw will take up a Shovel of hot Embers and throw them into a Captive's Bosom; and if he cry out, the other Indians will Laugh and Shout, and say, What a brave Action our old Grandmother has done! Sometimes they torture them with Whips &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Indians look'd on me with a fierce Countenance, signifying that it would be my turn next. They champ'd Corn-Stalks, and threw them in my Hat, which was in my Hand: I smiled on them, tho' my Heart ak'd. I look'd on one and another, but could not perceive that any Eye pitied me: Presently came a Squaw and a little Girl,
<PB N="8" REF="004021_0011_1003CC3F79D60BA8"/>
and laid down a Bag of Corn in the Ring; the little Girl took me by the Hand, making Signs for me to go out of the Circle with them: but not knowing their Custom, I supposed that they designed to kill me, and would not go out with them. Then a grave Indian came and gave me a short Pipe, and said, in English, Smoke it: then took me by the Hand and lead me out, but my Heart aked, think∣ing my self near my End, but he carried me to a French Hutt about a Mile from the Indian Fort. The Frenchman was not at Home; but his Wise who was a Squaw had some Discourse with my Indian Friend, which I did not understand. We tarried about two Hours, and return'd to the Village, where they gave me some Victuals. Not long after, I saw one of my Fellow-Captives, who gave me a me∣laucholly Account of their Sufferings, after I left them &amp;c.</P>

At our Arrival an old Squaw saluted me with a Yell, taking me by the Hair and one Hand; but I was so rude as to break her hold, and 'quit my self:—She gave me a filthy Grin, and the Indians set up a Laugh—so it pass'd over. Here we lived upon Fish, Wild-Grapes, Roots &amp;c. which was hard Living to me.</P>
<P>When the Winter came on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. VII. The first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nting.</NOTE> we went up the River till the Ice came down, and run thick in the River; and then, ac∣cording to the Indian Custom, laid up our Canoes till the Spring; and then travell'd sometimes on the Ice, &amp; some∣times on the Land, till we came to a River that was open and not Fordable, where we made a Raft, and pass'd over Bag and Baggage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Indian carry their House and Houshold Stuff on their Backs in the Winter, and to these they add, in the Summer, their Vessels and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Provisions &amp;c.</NOTE>. I met with no Abuse from them in this Winter's Hunting, tho' I was put to great Hardships in carrying Burdens, and for want of Food: for they under∣went the same Difficulty, and would often encourage me,
<PB N="9" REF="004021_0012_1003B10134A704E8"/>
saying, in broken English, <HI>By-by—great deal Moose.</HI> But they could not answer any Question that I asked them. So that knowing nothing of their Customs and way of Life; tho' I tho't it redious to be constantly moving from Place to Place, yet it might be in some respects an Advantage: for it ran still in my Mind that we were travelling to some Set∣tlement; and when my Burden was over heavy, and the Indians left me behind, and the still Evening came on; I fancied I could see thro' the Bushes, and hear the People of some great Town: which Hope might be some support to me in the Day, tho' I found not the Town at Night. Thus we have been Hunting three hundred Miles from the Sea and knew no Man within fifty or sixty Miles of us. We were eight or ten in Number, and had but two Indian Men with Guns, on whom we wholly depended for Food: and if any disaster had hap'ned, we must all have perished. And sometimes we had no manner of Sustenance for three or four Days: But GOD wonderfully provides for all Creatures! In one of those Fasts GOD's Providence was remarkable. Our two Indian Men, in Hunting, started a Moose <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Moose is a fine lofty Creature about eight Feet high, with a long Head and Nose like a Horse: with Horns very large and strong [Some of them are above six Feet, from the Extremity of one Horn to that of the other] shaped and shed every Year like the Horns of a Deer: likewise their Feet are cloven like Deers Feet. Their hind Legs are long and fore Legs short like a Rabbit. They resemble a Rabbit also in the length of their Ears and shortness of their Tail: The Female have two Dugs like a Mare, tho' they sometimes bring three young Ones, at a Foaling: they fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l but once a Year, and at one Seas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> When the Trees put out Leaves, for them.

The next Morning they followed him on the Track, and soon found the Moose lying on the Snow; for crossing the Roots of a large Tree, that had been blown up by the Roots, having Ice underneath, the Moose in his furious Flight broke thro', and hitch'd one of his hind Legs in among the Roots, so fast that by striving

<P>The way of their preserving Meat is by stripping off the Flesh from the Bones, and drying them over a Smoke; by which 'tis kept sound Months or Years, without Salt.</P>
<P>We moved still further up the Country after Moose when our Store was out: so that by the Spring we had got to the Northward of the <HI>Lady Mountains.</HI> And when the Spring came on and the Rivers broke up, we moved back to the Head of <HI>St. John's River;</HI> and there made Canoes of Moose-Hides sewing three or four together, and pitch∣ing the Seams with Charcoal beaten and mixt with Balsom.

Thus they divert themselves in their Dances!</P>
<P>On the second Spring of my Captivity my Indian Master and his Squaw went to <HI>Canada;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. Of their Bar∣barity to <HI>James Alex∣ander,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> but sent me down the Ri∣ver, with several Indians to the Fort; in order to plant Corn. The Day before we came to the Planting Field we met two Young Indian Men who seem'd to be in great haste: after they had pass'd us I understood that they were going with an Express to <HI>Canada,</HI> and that there was an English Vessel at the Mouth of the River. I not perfect in the Language, nor knowing that English Vessels traded with them in time of War, supposed a Peace was concluded on, and that the Captives would be released: and was so transported with the Fancy, that I slept but little, if at all, that Night. Early the next Morning we came to the Village, where the Ex∣tasy ended: For I had no sooner Landed, but three or four Indians drag'd me to the great Wigwam, where they were yelling and dancing round <HI>James Alexander,</HI> a Jersey Man, who was taken from <HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Casco Bay.</HI> This was oc∣casioned by two Families of <HI>Cape Sable</HI> Indians, who having lost some Friends by a number of English Fishermen, came some hundred of Miles to revenge themselves on the poor Captives! They soon came to me, &amp; tossed me about till I was almost breathless, &amp; then threw me into the Ring to my fellow Captive: and took him out again, and repeated their Barbarities to him. And then I was hal'd out again by three Indians, by the Hair of my Head, and held down by it, till one beat me on the Back &amp; Shoulders so long that my Breath was almost beat out of my Body. And then others put a Tomhake into my Hand, and order'd me get up and dance and sing Indian: which I perform'd with the great∣est reluctance, and in the Act seem'd resolute to purchase my Death, by killing two or three of those Monsters of Cruelty;
<PB N="9" REF="004021_0016_1003B11688D7D310"/>
thinking it impossible to survive their bloody Treatment; but it was impress'd on my Mind, <HI>'Tis not in their Power to take away your Life:</HI> so I desisted. Then those <HI>Cape Sa∣ble</HI> Indians came to me again like Bears bereaved of their Whelps, saying, <HI>Shall we who have lost Relations by the Eng∣lish, suffer an English Voice to be heard among us &amp;c.</HI> Then they beat me again with the Axe: Then I repented that I had not sent two or three of them out of the World be∣fore me, for I tho't that I had much rather die than suffer any longer. They left me the second time, and the other Indians put the Tomhake <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Tomhake is a Warlike Club, the Shape of which may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Cutts of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>,</HI> one of the four Indian Chiefs, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> com∣mon amongst us.</NOTE> into my Hand again, and com∣pelled me to sing: and then I seem'd more resolute than before to destroy some of them; but a strange and strong Impulse that I should return to my own Place &amp; People, sup∣press'd it as often as such a motion rose in my Breast. Not one of the Indians shew'd the least Compassion: but I saw the Tears run down plentifully on the Cheeks of a French∣man that sat behind; which did not alleviate the Tortures that poor <HI>James</HI> and I were forced to endure for the most part of this tedious Day; for they were continued till the Evening: and were the most severe that ever I met with in the whole six Years that I was Captive with the Indians.—After they had thus inhumanely abused us, two Indians took us up and threw us out of the Wigwam, and we crawled away on our Hands &amp; Feet, &amp; were scarce able to walk, &amp;c. for several Days. Some time after they again concluded on a merry Dance, when I was at some distance from the Wigwam dressing Leather, and an Indian was so kind as to tell me that they had got <HI>James Alexander,</HI> and were in search for me. My Indian Master and his Squaw bid me run as for my Life into a Swamp and hide, and not to dis∣cover my self unless they both came to me, for then I might be assured the Dance was over. I was now master of their Language, and a Word or a Wink was enough to excite me to take care of One. I ran to the Swamp, and hid in the thickest place that I could find. I heard hollowing and whooping all around me; sometimes they pass'd very near,
<PB N="14" REF="004021_0017_1003CCA426626E68"/>
and I could hear some threaten, and others flatter me, but I was not dispos'd to dance: and if they had come upon me, I resolv'd to show them a pair of Heels, and they must have had good luck to have catch'd me. I heard no more of them till about Evening [for I think I slept] when they came again, calling <HI>Chon, Chon,</HI> but <HI>John</HI> would not trust them. After they were gone, my Master and his Squaw came where they told me to hide, but could not find me; and when I heard them say with some concern, that they believ'd that the other Indians had frightned me into the Woods, and that I was lost; I came out, and they seem'd well pleas'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and told me, that <HI>James</HI> had had a bad Day of it; that as soon as he was releas'd he ran away into the Woods, &amp; they believ'd he was gone to the <HI>Mohawks. James</HI> soon returned, &amp; gave me a melancholly Account of his Suf∣ferings: and the Indians fright concerning the <HI>Mohawks</HI> pass'd over. They often had terrible apprehension of the Incursion of the <HI>Mohawks</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are called also <HI>Maquas,</HI> a most ambitious, haughty and blood thirsty People: from whom the other Indians take their Measures and Manners: and their Modes and Changes of Dress &amp;c.</NOTE>.

The next dark Night <HI>James</HI> going for Water, set his Kettle on the descent to the lowest Interval; and ran back to the Fort, puffing &amp; blow∣ing, as in the utmost Surprize; and told his Master that he saw something near the Spring, that look'd like <HI>Mohawks:</HI> [which he said were only Stumps—aside] his Master being a most couragious Warrior, went with <HI>James</HI> to make dis∣covery, and when they came to the brow of the Hill, <HI>James</HI> pointed to the Stumps, and withal touch'd his Kettle with
<PB N="15" REF="004021_0018_1003CCB134A4AF40"/>
his Toe, which gave it motion down Hill, and at every turn of the Kettle the Bail clattered; upon which <HI>James</HI> and his Master could see a <HI>Mohawk</HI> in every Stump on motion, <HI>and turn'd Tail to,</HI> and he was the best Man that could ran fastest. This alarm'd all the Indians in the Village.

<P>But my most intimate and dear Companion was one <HI>John Evans,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III.

An English Captive Girl about this time, (who was taken by <HI>Medocawand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) would often falsely accuse us of plotting to desert, but we made the Truth so plainly appear, that she was check'd and we released.

<HEAD>Of further Difficulties and Deliverances.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Winter as we were moving from Place to Place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of a near e∣scape from Death by Frost.</NOTE> our Hunters kill'd some Moose; and one lying some Miles from our Wigwams, a Young Indian &amp; my self were ordered to fetch part of it. We set out in the Morning when the Weather was promising, but it proved a very Cold, Cloudy Day. It was late in the Evening we arrived at the Place where the Moose lay: so that we had no time to provide Materials for Fire or Shelter. At the same time a Storm came on very thick of Snow, and continued till the next Morning. We made a small Fire with what little Rubbish we could find around us, which with the heat of our Bodies melted the Snow upon us as fast as it fell, and fill'd our Cloaths with Water. Nevertheless, early in the Morning, we took our Loads of Moose-Flesh, and set out, in order to return to our Wigwams: We had not travelled far before my Moose-Skin Coat (which was the only Gar∣ment that I had on my Back, and the Hair was in most Places worn off) was froze stiff round my Knees like a Hoop, as likewise my Snow-shoes &amp; Shoe-clouts to my Feet! Thus I march'd the whole Day without Fire or Food! at first I was in great Pain, then my Flesh numb'd, and I felt at times extream Sick, and tho't I could not travel one foot further; but wonderfully reviv'd again. After long travelling I felt very drowsy, &amp; had thoughts of setting down; which had I done, without doubt I had fall'n on my final Sleep; as my dear Companion, <HI>Evans,</HI> had done before; for my In∣dian Companion, being better Cloath'd, had left me long before: but again my Spirits reviv'd as much as if I had receiv'd the richest Cordial! Some Hours after Sun-set I recovered the Wigwam, and crawl'd in with my Snow-shoes on. The Indians cry'd out, <HI>The Captive is froze to Death!</HI> They took off my Pack, and where that lay against my Back was the only Place that was not frozen. The Indians cut off my Shoes, and stript the Clouts from my Feet, which were as void of feeling as any frozen Flesh could be: but I had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at long by the Fire, before the Blood began to cir∣culate,
<PB N="17" REF="004021_0020_1003CCD8A0E2D2C0"/>
and my Feet to my Ankles turn'd black, &amp; swelled with bloody Blisters, and were inexpressibly painful. The Indians said one to another, <HI>His Feet will rot, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> die.</HI> Nevertheless, I slept well at Night. Soon after the Skin came off my Feet from my Ankles whole like a Shoe, and left my Toes naked without a Nail, and the ends of my great Toe-Bones bare, which in a little time turn'd black, so that I was obliged to cut the first Joint off with my Knife. The Indians gave me Rags to bind up my Feet, &amp; advis'd me to apply Fir-balsom, but withal said, that they believ'd it was not worth while to use means, for I should certainly die. But by the use of my Elbows and a Stick in each Hand, I shov'd my self on my Bottom, over the Snow, from one Tree to another, till I got some Fir-balsom, then burn'd it in a Clam-shell till it was of a consistence like Salve, and apply'd it to my Feet and Ankles, and by the divine Blessing within a Week I could go about upon my Heels with my Staff. And thro' GOD's goodness, we had Provision enough, so that we did not remove under ten or fifteen Days, and then the In∣dians made two little Hoops something in Form as a Snow-shoe, and seiz'd them to my Feet: and I follow'd them in their Track on my Hee's from Place to Place; sometimes half Leg deep in Snow &amp; Water, which gave me the most acute Pain imaginable, but I was forced to walk or die. But within a Year my Feet were intirely well, &amp; the Nails came on my great Toes: so that a very critical Eye, could scarce perceive any part missing, or that they had been froze at all!</P>
<P>In a Time of great scarcity of Provisions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II.—By the Fall of a Scaf∣fold on my Head.</NOTE> the Indians chas'd a large Moose into the River and kill'd him; and brought the Flesh to the Village, and laid it on a Scaffold in a large Wigwam, in order to make a Feast. I was very officious in supplying them with Wood &amp; Water, which pleased them so well, that they now &amp; then gave me a piece of Flesh half boil'd or roasted, which I did eat with eagerness: and I doubt without great Thankfulness to the divine BEING, who so extraordinarily fed me!—At length the Scaffold broke, and one large Piece fell and knock'd me on the Head [the Indians said that I lay stun'd a considerable time] the first

I look'd for the Indian, and he was half a Mile distant up the River. I went to him, and ask'd, Why he did not tow me to the Bank, seeing he knew that I could not Swim? He said he knew that I was un∣der the Canoe, for there were no Bubbles any where to be seen, &amp; that I should drive on the Point: therefore he took care of his fine Sturgeon, which was eight or ten Feet long.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="004021_0023_1003CCF294E31B60"/>
execute his Vengeance upon such! He gave an Account of the Reta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations of Providence to those murderous <HI>Cape-Sable</HI> Indians above mentioned. One of whom ran a Splin∣ter into his Foot, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ester'd and rotted his Flesh till it kill'd him. Another ran a Fish-bone into her Hand or Arm, and she rotted to Death, notwithstanding all Means that were used. In some such manner they all died, so that not one of those two Families lived to return home. Were it not for this Remark of the Priest, I should not, perhaps, have made the Observation.</P>
<P>There was an old Squaw who ever endeavoured to out∣do all others in Cruelty to Captives. <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II.—Of a Bar∣barous Old Squaw.</NOTE> Where-ever she came into a Wigwam, where any poor naked starved Captives were sitting near the Fire; if they were grown Persons, she would privately take up a Shovel of hot Coals, &amp; throw them into their Bosom; or Young Ones, she would take by the Hand or Leg, and drag them thro' the Fire &amp;c. The Indians according to their Custom left their Village in the Fall of the Year and dispersed themselves for Hunting, and after the first or second removal, they all strangely forgot that old Squaw and her Grandson about Twelve Years of Age. They were found dead in the Place where they were left, some Months afterward, and no further notice taken of them. This was very much observed by the Priest; and seem'd strange to all that heard it, for the Indians were ge∣nerally very careful not to leave their Old or Young!</P>
<P>In the latter part of Summer, or beginning of Autumn, the Indians were frequently frighted by the Appearance of strange Indians passing up &amp; down this River in Canoes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III. Of a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gue among them</NOTE> and about that Time the next Year died more than One Hun∣dred Persons of Old &amp; Young: all or most of those that saw those strange Indians! The Priest said, that it was a sort of Plague. A Person seeming in perfect Health, would bleed at the Mouth &amp; Nose, turn blue in Spots, and die in two or three Hours [It was very tedious to me who was forced to move from Place to Place this cold Season. The Indians applied red Oker to my Sores, which by GOD's Blessing cured me.] The Indians all scattered, it being at

the worst as Winter came on; and the Blow was so great that the Indians did not Settle or Plant at the Village while I was on the River, and I know not whether they have to this Day!</P>
<P>Before they thus deserted the Village, when they came in from Hunting, they would be drunk and fight for seve∣ral Days and Nights together, till they had spent most of their Skins in Wine &amp; Brandy, which was brought to the Village by a French Man, call'd Monsieur <HI>Sige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioncer.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of their Familiarity with, &amp; Frights from the Devil &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indians are very often surprized with the Appea∣rance of Ghosts &amp; Demons; <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of their Po∣wawing.</NOTE> and sometimes encou∣raged by the Devil, for they go to him for Success in Hunt∣ing &amp;c. I was once Hunting with Indians who were not brought over to the Romish Faith: and after several Days Hunting they proposed to inquire, according to their Custom, what Success they should have. They accordingly prepa∣red many Hot-Stones, and laid them in an heap, &amp; made a small Hutt covered with Skins &amp; Matts, and then in the dark Night two of the Powaws went into this Hot-House with a large Vessel of Water, which at Times they poured on those hot Rocks, which raised a thick Steam, so that a third Indian was oblig'd to stand without, and lift up a Matt, to give it vent when they were almost suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cated. There was an old Squaw who was kind to Captives, and never join'd with them in their Powawing, to whom I manifested an ear∣nest desire to see their Management: She told me, that if they knew of my being there, they would kill me, and that when she was a Girl, she had known Young Persons to be taken away by an hairy Man: and therefore she would not advise me to go, lest the hairy Man should carry me away. I told her that I was not afraid of that hairy Man, nor could he hurt me if she would not discover me to the Powaws. At length she promised that she would not, but charged me to be careful of my self.—I went within three or four Feet of the Hot-House, for it was very dark, and heard strange
<PB N="22" REF="004021_0025_1003B138098B4C60"/>
Noises &amp; Yellings, such as I never heard before. At Times the Indian who tended without would lift up the Matt, and a Steam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up, which look'd like Fire in the dark. I lay there two or three Hours, but saw none of their hairy Men or Demons: And when I found that they had finished their Cerem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny, I went to the Wigwam, and told the Squaw what had pass'd; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was glad that I return'd without hurt; and never discover'd what I had done. After some time, inquiry was made, what Success we were like to have in our Hunt∣ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The Powaws said, that they had very likely Signs of Success, but no real, visible Appearance as at other Times. A few Days after, we moved up the River, and had pret∣ty good Success.</P>
<P>One Afternoon as I was in a Canoe with one of the Po∣waws, the Dog bark'd, and presently a Moose pass'd by, within a few Rods of us, so that the Waves which he made by wading roll'd our Canoe; the Indian shot at him, but the Moose took very little notice of it, and went into the Woods to the Southward: the Fellow said, <HI>I'll try if I can't fetch you back, for all your haste.</HI> The Evening following, we built our two Wigwams on a Sandy Point on the upper End of an Island in the River, Northwest of the Place where the Moose went into the Woods: and the Indian powaw'd the greatest part of the Night following, and in the Morn∣ing we had the fair track of a Moose, round our Wigwams, tho' we did not see or taste of it.—I am of Opinion, that the Devil was permitted to humour those unhappy Wret∣ches sometimes, in some things.</P>
<P>An Indian being some Miles from his Wigwam, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. An Instance of the Devil's frighting the Indians.</NOTE> and the Weather being warm, he supposed the Hedge-Hogs would come out of their Den, he way-laid the Mouth of it till late at Night. [See Chap. 6. Sect. 3.] They not coming out as usual, he was going home, but had not passed far, before he saw a Light like a Blaze, at a little distance be∣fore him, and darting his Spear at it, it disappeared; then on the Bank of the River, he heard a loud Laughter, with a noise like a ratling in a Man's Throat. The Indian rail'd at the Demon whom he suppos'd made the Noise, calling it a rotten Spirit of no Substance &amp;c. He continued to hear the
<PB N="23" REF="004021_0026_1003CD15A8C0F7D8"/>
Noise and see the Light 'till he came into the Wigwam, which he entred, in his hunting Habit, with Snow-shoes and all on; so frighted, that, it was some time before he could speak to relate what had happened.</P>
<P>That it may further appear how much they were deluded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Indian Fables.</NOTE> or under the Influence of Satan, read two Stories which were related and believed by the Indians.</P>
<P>The first; of a Boy who was carried away by a large Bird called a <HI>Gulloua,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an Indian carried away and return'd by a <HI>Gulloua.</HI></NOTE> who buildeth her Nest on an high Rock or Mountain. A Boy was Hunting with his Bow &amp; Arrow at the Foot of a Rocky Mountain, when the <HI>Gulloua</HI> came diving thro' the Air, grasp'd the Boy in her Talons; and tho' he was eight or ten Years of Age, she soar'd alost, and laid him in her Nest, a Prey for her Young; where the Boy lay constantly on his Face, but would look sometimes under his Arms and saw two Young Ones with much Fish and Flesh in the Nest, and the old Bird constantly beinging more. So that the young Ones not touching him, the old One claw'd him up and set him where she found him; who returned, and related the odd Event to his Friends. As I have, in a Canoe, pass'd near the Mountain, the Indians have said to me, <HI>There is the Nest of the great Bird that car∣ried the Boy away:</HI> And there seem'd to be a great num∣ber of Sticks put together in form of a Nest on the Top of the Mountain. At another time they said; <HI>There is the Bird, but be is now, as a Boy to a Gians, to what he was in former Days.</HI> The Bird which they pointed to, was a large speckled Bird, like an Eagle, tho' some what larger.</P>
<P>The other Notion is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Boy that was enter∣tain'd by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> That a young Indian in his Hunting was belated and lost his Way, and on a sudden he was in∣troduced to a large Wigwam full of dry'd Eels, which prov'd to be a <HI>Beaver's</HI> House, in which he liv'd till the Spring of the Year, when he was turned out of the House, and set up∣on a Beaver-Damm, and went Home, and related the Affair to his Friends, at large.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><LG>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A Description of several Creatures commonly taken by the Indians on St. John's River.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Beaver</HI> has a very thick strong Neck, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of the <HI>Bea∣ver.</HI></NOTE> his fore Teeth, which are two in the upper and two in the under Jaw, are concave and sharp like a Carpenter's Googe. Their side-Teeth are like a Sheep's, for they chew the Cud. Their Legs are short, the Claws something longer than in other Creatures; the Nails on the Toes of their hind Feet are flat like an Ape's, but join'd together by a Membra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as those of Water Fowl, their Tails broad and flat like the broad End of a Paddle. Near their Tails they have four Bottles, two of which contain Oil, the other Gum, the necks of these meet in one common Orifice; the latter of these contain the proper Castorum, and not the Testicles, as some have fancied, for the Testicles are distinct &amp; seperate from these, in the Males only; but the Castorum and Oyl∣Bottles are common to Male and Female. With this Oyl and Gum they preen themselves, so that when they come out of the Water it runs off them, as it doth off a Fowl. They have four Teats, which are on their Breasts, so that they hug up their Young, and suckle them, as Women do their Infants. They have generally two and sometimes four in a Litter. I have seen seven or five in the Matrix: but the Indians think it a strange thing to find so many in a Litter, and they assert, that when it so happens, the Dam kills all above four. They are the most laborious Creatures that I have met with. I have known them to build Damms across Rivers which were thirty or forty Perch wide, with Wood &amp; Mud, so as to flow many Acres of Land: in the deepest part of a Pond so raised, they build their Houses round in the Figure of an Indian Wigwam, eight or ten Feet in height, and six or eight Feet diameter on the Floor; which is made descending to the Water, the Parts near the Center about four, and near the Circumference between ten and twenty Inches above the Water: These Floors are co∣vered with strippings of Wood like Shavings; on these they sleep with their Tails in the Water, and if the Freshits rise
<PB N="25" REF="004021_0028_1003CD1C8CF31BF8"/>
they have the advantage of rising on their Floor to the high∣est part. They feed on the Leaves and Bark of Trees and Pond-Lilly-Roots. In the Fall of the Year they lay in their Provision for the approaching Winter; cutting down Trees great and small, with one end in their Mouths they drag their Branches near to their House, and sink many Cords of it. [They will cut down Trees of a Fathom in Circumference.] They have Doors to go down to the Wood under the Ice, and in case the Freshits rise, break down and carry off their Store of Wood, they often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They have a Note for conversing, calling &amp; warning each other, when at Work or Feeding; &amp; while they are at Labour they keep out a Guard, who upon the first approach of an Enemy so strikes the Water with it's Tail, that he may be heard half a Mile; which so alarms the rest, that they are all silent, quit their Labour, and are to be seen no more for that Time. And if the Male or Female die, the sur∣viving seeks a Mate, and conducts him or her to their House, and carry on Affairs as above.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wolverin</HI> is a very fierce and mischievous Creature: <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. Of the <HI>Wol∣verin.</HI></NOTE> about the bigness of a middling Dog, having short Legs, broad Feet, &amp; very sharp Claws; and in my Opinion may be reckoned a Species of Cats. They will climb Trees, and wait for Moose and other Creatures who feed below, and when an Opportunity presents jump and strike their Claws in them so fast, that they will hang on them 'till they have gnaw'd the main Nerve of the Neck asunder, &amp; the Crea∣ture dies. I have known many Moose kill'd thus. I was once travelling a little way behind several Indians, &amp; heard them Laughing very merrily: when I came to them, they shew'd me the Track of a Moose, and how a <HI>Wolverin</HI> had climb'd a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and where he had jump'd off upon the Moose; and the Moose had given several large Leaps, and happening to come under a Branch of a Tree, had broke the <HI>Wolverin's</HI> hold and tore him off: and by his Track in the Snow, he went off another, with short steps, as if he had been stun'd with the Blow. The Indians who impute such Accidents to the cunning of the Creature, were wonder∣fully pleased that the Moose should thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the mis∣chievous <HI>Wolverin'</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004021_0029_1003B14430198D88"/>These <HI>Wolverins,</HI> go into Wigwams which have been left for any Time, scatter the Things abroad, and most filthily pollute them with Ordure. I have heard the Indians say, that they have hal'd their Guns from under their Heads, while they were asleep; and left them so defil'd. An In∣dian told me, that having left his Wigwam with sundry Things on the Scaffold, among which was a Birch-Flask with several Pounds of Powder in it: At their return they were much surpriz'd and griev'd, for a light Snow had fal∣len, and a <HI>Wolverin</HI> visits their Wigwam, mounts the Scaf∣fold, and—to plundering, heaves down Bag &amp; Baggage; the Powder happ'ned to fall into the Fire, which fill'd the <HI>Wolverin's</HI> Eyes, and threw him and the Wigwam some Rods. At length they found the blind Creature rambling backward and forward, had the satisfaction of kicking and beating him about, which in great measure made up their Loss: and then they could contentedly pick up their Uten∣sils, and rig out their Wigwam!</P>
<P>Our <HI>Hedge-Hog</HI> or <HI>Urchin</HI> is about the bigness of a Hog of six Months old, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III. Of the <HI>Hedge-Hog or Urchin.</HI></NOTE> his Back and Sides and Tail are full of sharp Quills, so that if any Creature approach, they will con∣tract themselves to a globular Form; if a Creature attack them, those Quills are so sharp and lose in their Skins that they fix in the Mouth of the Adversary and leave their own Skin. They will strike with great force, with their Tails; so that whatever falls under the lash of them, are certainly fill'd with their Prickles: But that they shoot their Quills, as some assert they do, is a great mistake as to the <HI>American,</HI> and I believe as to the <HI>African Hedge-Hog</HI> or <HI>Porcupine</HI> also; as to the former I have taken them at all Seasons of the Year. See Chap. 5. Sect. 2.</P>
<P>It is needless to describe the fresh-water <HI>Tortoise,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. IV. Of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> whose Form is so well-known in all Parts: but their way of pro∣pagating their Species is not so universally known. I have observed that sort whose Shell is about fourteen or sixteen Inches wide: in their Coition or Treading they may be heard half a Mile, making a noise like a Woman washing her Linnen with a batting Staff—They lay their Eggs in
<PB N="27" REF="004021_0030_1003CD23C8F899B0"/>
the Sand; near some deep still Water, about a Foot beneath the surface of the Sand. They are very curious in cover∣ing them with the Sand, so that there is not the least mix∣ture of it amongst them; nor the least rising of Sand on the Beach where they lie: I have often search'd for them with the Indians, by thursting a Stick into the Sand, about the Beech at random, and brought up some part of an Egg clinging to it: and uncovering the Place have found near an hundred &amp; fifty in one Nest. Both their Eggs &amp; Flesh are good-Eating when boil'd &amp;c. I have observed a diffe∣rence as to the length of Time which they are hatching, which is between twenty &amp; thirty Days, some sooner than others: Whether this difference ought to be imputed to the various Quality or Site of the Sand in which they lay (as to it's cold or heat &amp;c) I leave to the Conjecture of the Vir∣tuosi.—As soon as they were hatch'd, they broke thro' the Sand and betook themselves to the Water, as far as I could discover, without any further Care or Help of the Old Ones.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Salmon</HI> I shall only note, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. V. Of the <HI>Sal∣mon.</HI></NOTE> that they come from the Sea early in the Spring, to the fresh Rivers; and with great pains ascend the Falls, till they come to the Heads of the Rivers; where the Water runs riffling over a coarse Gravel near some Pond or deep still Water: there they work Holes to lodge in, and in the Night resort to them, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo &amp; two, the Male with his Female; thus lying together the Female ejects a Spawn, like a Pea; the Male a Sperm like Milk, which sick among the Gravel.

<HEAD>Of their Feasting, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Indians determine for War, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of their Feasting be∣fore they go out to War.</NOTE> or are enter∣ing upon a particular Expedition, they kill a num∣ber of their Dogs, burn off their Hair, and cut them into Pieces; leaving only one Dog's Head whole; the rest of the Flesh they boil, and make a fine Feast of it: after which, the Dog's Head that was left whole is scorch'd, 'till the Nose and Lips have shrunk from the Teeth, and left them bare and grinning; this done; they fasten it on a Stick, and the Indian who is proposed to be Chief in the Expedition takes the Head into his Hand and sings a Warlike Song: in which he mentions the Town they design to Attack, and the principal Man in it, threatning that in a few Days he will carry that Man's Head and Scalp in his Hand, in the same manner. When the Chief hath Sung, he so places the Dog's Head as to grin at him whom he supposeth will go his Second: who, if he accepts, takes the Head in his Hand and sings, but if he refuse to go, he turns the Teeth to another; and thus from one to another 'till they have inlisted their Company.</P>
<P>The Indians imagine that Dog's Flesh makes them bold and courageous! I have seen an Indian split a Dog's Head with a Hatchet, and take out the Brains hot, and eat them raw, with the Blood running down his Jaws!</P>
<P>When a Relation dies; <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. Of their Mourning for the Dead, and Feast after it.</NOTE> in a still Evening, a Squaw will walk on the highest Land near her abode, and with a loud, mournful Voice exclaim, <HI>Oh hawe, hawe, hawe,</HI> with a long mournful Tone to each <HI>hawe,</HI> for a long time together.</P>
<P>After the mourning Season is over, the Relations of the deceased make a Feast to wipe off Tears; and they may Marry freely. If the deceas'd were a Squaw, the Relations consult together and choose a Squaw (doubtless a Widow) and send her to the Widower: and if he like her he takes her to be his Wife, if not, he sends her back; and the Relations choose and send 'till they find one that he approv∣eth of.</P>

If she likes him, she throws the Chip to him, with a modest Smile; and then no∣thing is wanting but a Ceremony with the Jesuit to con∣summate the Marriage; But if the Young Squaw dislike the Fellow, she with a surly Countenance throws the Chip aside, and he comes no more there—.</P>

<P>I have heard an Indian say, that he lived by the River at the Foot of the <HI>Teddon,</HI> and in his Wigwam, seeing the top of it thro' the Hole left in the top of the Wigwam for the passing of Smoke, he was tempted to travel to it: ac∣cordingly he set out early on a Summer's Morning, and la∣boured hard in ascending the Hill all Day, and the Top seem'd as distant from the Place where he lodged at Night, as from the Wigwam whence he began his Journey: and concluding that Spirits were there, never dare make a se∣cond Attempt.</P>

<HEAD>Of my three Years Captivity with the French.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN about six Years of my doleful Captivity had past, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. I. Of a Conten∣tion among the Indians, which caused them to sell me to the French.</NOTE> my second Indian Master dyed, whose Squaw and my first Indian Master disputed whose Slave I should be; and some malicious Persons advised them to end the Quarrel by putting a Period to my Life: but honest Father <HI>Simon,</HI> the Priest of the River, told them that it would be a heinous Crime, and advised them to sell me to the French. There came annually one or two Men of War to Supply the Fort, which was on the River about thirty four Leagues from the Sea: The Indians having Advice of the Arrival of a Man of War at the Mouth of the River, they, about thirty or forty in Number went aboard: For the Gentlemen from <HI>France</HI> made a Present to them every Year, and set forth the Riches &amp; Victories of their Monarch &amp;c. at this Time they presented a Bag or two of Flour with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as Ingredients for a Feast. I, who was dress'd up in an old greasy Blanket, without Cap, Hat or Shirt, (for I had no Shirt for the six Years, but that which was on my Back when I was taken) was invited into the great Cabbin, where many well rigg'd Gentlemen were sitting, who would sain have had a full view of me: I endeavoured to hide my self behind the Hangings, for I was much ashamed; thinking of my former wearing Cloaths, and of my living with Peo∣ple
<PB N="33" REF="004021_0036_1003CD37EF426380"/>
who could rigg as well as the best of them. My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asked me, Whether I chose to be sold aboard the Man of War, or to the Inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? I replied with Tears, I shou'd be glad if you would sell me to the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom you took me; but if I must be sold to the French, I choose to be Sold to the lowest on the River, or nearest Inhabitant to the Sea, about twenty-five Leagues from the Mouth of the River: for I tho't, that, if I were sold to the Gentle∣men aboard the Man of War, I should never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the English. This was the first sight I had of Salt Water in my Captivity, and the first time that I had tasted Salt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bread.</P>
<P>My Master presently went ashore, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. II. Of my being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old to the French.</NOTE> and after a few Days all the Indians went up the River; and when we came to the House which I mentioned to my Master, he went ashore with me and tarried all Night: the Master of the House spake kindly to me in Indian, for I could not then speak one Word of French: Madam also look'd pleasant on me, and gave me some Bread. The next Day I was sent six Leagues further up the River to another French House. My Master and the Fryar tarried with Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the Gentleman who had entertain'd us the Night before. Not long after, Father <HI>Simon</HI> came and said, Now you are one of us, for you are sold to that Gentleman by whom you were entertain'd the other Night. I replied;—Sold!—to a Frenchman!—I could say no more!—went into the Woods alone and wept till I could scarce see or stand! The word <HI>Sold,</HI> and that to a People of that Perswasion, which my dear Mother so much detested, and in her last Words manifested so great Fears of my falling into!—the Thoughts of these almost broke my Heart! When I had given vent to my Passions, I rub'd my Eyes, endeavouring to hide my Grief: But Father <HI>Simon</HI> perceiving that my Eyes were swoln, called me aside; and bid me not to grieve: for the Gentleman to whom I was sold was of a good hu∣mour, that he had formerly bought two Captives of the In∣dians, who both went home to <HI>Boston;</HI> this in some measure revived me. But he added, that, he did not suppose that I would ever incline to go to the English, for the French way of Worship was much to be preferred: also, that he
<PB N="34" REF="004021_0037_1003B159B00E8550"/>
should pass that way in about ten Days, and if I did not like to live with the French better than with the Indians, he would buy me again. On the Day following, Father <HI>Simon</HI> and my Indian Master went up the River six &amp; thirty Leagues, to their Chief Village, and I went down the Ri∣ver six Leagues with two Frenchmen to my new Master: Who kindly receiv'd me, and in a few Days Madam made me an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nabrigs Shirt and French Cap, and a Coat out of one of my Master's old Coats; then I threw away my greasy Blanket and Indian Flap, and look'd as smart as—. And I never more saw the old Fryar, the Indian Village, or my Indian Master, till about fourteen Years after I saw my Indian Master at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> whither I was sent by the Government, with a Flag on Truce, for exchanging Prisoners: and again about twenty four Years since he came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>St. John's</HI> to <HI>George's</HI> to see me, where I made him very welcome.</P>
<P>My French Master held a great Trade with the Indians, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. III.

<P>In the Year 1696 two Men of War came to the Mouth of the River, which had taken the <HI>New-Port,</HI> Capt. <HI>Paxton</HI> Commander, and brought him with them: They made the Indians some Presents, and invited them to join in an Ex∣pedition to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> which Invitation they accepted, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arrived there; and Capt. <HI>Chubb</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> says wittily (as he said every thing) <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> found Opportunity in a pretty <HI>Chubbish manner,</HI> to kill the famous <HI>Edgeremet</HI> &amp; <HI>Ahenquid,</HI> a couple of principal Indians, with one or two other Indians, on a Lord's Day, the sixteenth of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> 1695 If there were any unfair Dealing in this Action of <HI>Chubb,</HI> there will be another <HI>February,</HI> not far off, wherein the A∣venger of Blood will take their Satisfaction. <HI>Hist of</HI> N.

<L>"Unthinking Men no sort of Scruples make;</L>
<L>"And some are bad, only for Mischief's sake;</L>
<L>"But ev'n the Best are guilty by Mistake.</L></NOTE>. Early in the Spring I was sent, with three Frenchmen, to the Mouth of the River, for Provision which came from <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> We carried over Land, from the River to a large Bay, where we were driven on an Island by a North-East Storm, and were kept there seven Days, without any Sustenance, for we expected a quick Passage and carried nothing with us; the Wind continuing bois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rous, so that we could not return back, and the Ice prevent∣ed our going forward: After seven Days the Ice broke up, and we went forward, tho' we were so weak that we could scarce hear each other speak; and the People at the Mouth of the River were surprized to see us so feeble; and advised us to be cautious &amp; abstemious in eating. By this Time, I knew as much of Fasting as they, and dieted on Broth, and recovered very well, as also one of the others did; but the other two would not be advised: and I never saw any Per∣sons in greater Torment than they were, till they obtain'd a Passage—on which they recovered.</P>
<P>A Friar who lived in the Family invited me to Confession, <NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT. IV. Of the Frya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s transaction while I was among them.</NOTE> but I excused my self as well as I could. One Evening he took me into his Apartment, in the dark, and advised me to confess to him what Sins I had committed: I told him, that I could not remember a thousandth part of them (they were so numerous:) Then he bid me remember and relate as many as I could, and he would pardon them; sig∣nifying that he had a Bag to put them in. I told him that I did not believe that it was in the power of any but GOD to pardon Sin. He asked me, whether I had read the Bi∣ble? I told him that I had when I was a little Boy, so long since, that I had forgot most of it. Then he told me, that he did not pardon my Sins; but when he knew them
<PB N="36" REF="004021_0039_1003B16077124058"/>
he prayed GOD to pardon them: when, perhaps I was at my Sports and Plays.—He wish'd me well, and hoped that I should be better advised, and said that he should call for me in a little Time: Thus he dismiss'd and never call'd me to Confession more.</P>
<P>The Gentleman whom I lived with had a fine Field of Wheat, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Jesuit's Ceremony to break up the Haunt of Black Birds.</NOTE> which great numbers of Black Birds, visited; and destroy'd much of. But the French said a Jesuit would come and banish them; who came at length, and all things were prepared, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a Bason of, what they call, Holy-Wa∣ter,; a Staff with a little Brush to sprinkle withal, &amp; the Jesuit's white Robe, which he put on. [I ask'd several Prisoners, who had lately been taken by Privateers and brought hither, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Mr. <HI>Woodberry, Cocks,</HI> &amp; <HI>Morgan,</HI> whether they would go and see the Ceremony? Mr. <HI>Wood∣berry</HI> ask'd me, whether I designed to go? I told him that I did. He said, that I was then as bad a Papist as they, and a d—n'd Fool. I told him that I believ'd as little of it as they did, but I inclined to see the Ceremony, that I might rehearse it to the English.] They entred the Field and walk'd through the Wheat in Procession, a young Lad go∣ing before the Jesuit with a Bason of their Holy-Water; then the Jesuit with his Brush, dipping it into the Bason, and sprinkling the Field on each side of him; next him a little Bell tingling, and about thirty Men following in order, Singing, with the Jesuit, <HI>Ora pro N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bis;</HI> at the End of the Field they Wheel'd to the Left about, and return'd. Thus they went through the Field of Wheat, the Birds rising be∣fore them and lighting behind them. At their return I said to a French Lad; The Fryar hath done no S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vice,—He had better take a Gun and shoot the Birds. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lad left me a while (I tho't, to ask the Jesuit what to say) and when he returned, he said, the Sins of the People were so great, that the Fryar could not prevail against those Creatures. The same Jesuit as vainly attempted to banish the Musche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes at <HI>Sigenecto,</HI> for the Sins of that People were so great also, that he could not prevail against them, but rather drew more as the French inform'd me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

And now if you will not run away to the English who are coming up the River, but serve our Interest, I will acquaint <HI>Monsieur</HI> of it at his return from <HI>France,</HI> which will be very pleasing to him: And I now give my Word, that, you shall have liberty to go to <HI>Boston</HI> on the first Opportunity (if you desire it) or that any other Favour, in my Power, shall not be de∣ny'd you.</Q></P>

Soon after we heard the great Guns at Governour <HI>Vielbon's</HI> Fort, which the English engag'd several Days, kill'd one Man, and drew off and went down the River; for it was so late in the Fall, that had they tarried a few Days longer, in the River; they would have been froze in for the Winter. Hearing no report of the great Guns for several Days, I with two others went down to our House, to make discovery—: where we found our young Lad who was taken by the English when they went up the River: For the General was so honourable that, on reading the Note on our Door, he ordered that the House and Barn should not be burnt, nor their Cattle or other Creatures kill'd; ex∣cept one or two, and the Poultry, for their Use: and at their return, order'd the young Lad to be put ashore.

Governour STOUGHTON Commander in Chief, to go Interpreter, at <HI>Three Pounds</HI> per Month, with Major <HI>Converse,</HI> and old Capt. <HI>Alden,</HI> to <HI>Penobscot</HI> to fetch Captives—at our return to <HI>Boston</HI> I was dismiss'd. But within a few Days the Governour sent for me to Interpret a Conference with <HI>Bommazeea</HI> and other Indians then in Goal.</P>
<P>Sometime after I was again put in Pay in order to go Interpreter with Col. <HI>Phillips</HI> and Capt. <HI>Southack</HI> in the Province Galley to <HI>Cases Bay,</HI> to Exchange said Indians for English Captives. <HI>December</HI> 1698, we return'd to <HI>Boston</HI> with several English Captives, and I was dis∣miss'd the Service, and desired to attend it in the Spring. I plead∣ed to be kept in Pay that I might have wherewith to support me at School—I went into the Country to <HI>Rowley</HI> (where Boarding was cheap) to practice what little I had attain'd at School.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1699. With the little of my Wages that I could reserve, I paid for my Schooling &amp; Board, and attended the Service upon Re∣quest; and was again put into Pay, and went with Col. <HI>Phillips</HI> and Major <HI>Converse</HI> in a large Brigantine up <HI>Kenebeck River,</HI> for Captives: and at our return to <HI>Boston,</HI> the Province Galley being arrived from <HI>New York</HI> with my Lord BILLEMONY, and the Province Truck put on board, I was ordered on board the Galley; we Cruised the Eastern Shore: And in <HI>November</HI> 1699, I was put out of Pay, tho' I pleaded to be continued under Pay seeing I must attend the Service in the Spring, and be at considerable Expence in the Winter for my Schooling.</P>
<P><PB REF="004021_0045_1003B16FB56DF698"/>In the Spring 1700, I attended the Service &amp; was put into Pay—27<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>August</HI>—Orders from the Government to build a Fort at <HI>Cases Bay,</HI> which was finished <HI>October</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> and the Province-Truck landed and I ordered to reside, as Interpreter, with a Captain &amp;c. in said Garrison. Not long after Governour DUDLET sent me a Lieu∣tenants Commission with Memorandum on the back—<HI>No further Pay but as Interpreter at</HI> Three Pounds <HI>per Month.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 10<HI>th.</HI> 1703. The French and Indians besieged our Fort six Days, Major <HI>March</HI> Commander: On the 16<HI>th.</HI> Day of the same, Capt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> arrived in the Province Galley, and the Night fol∣lowing the Enemy withdrew.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19<HI>th.</HI> 1704. I received a few Lines from His Excellency di∣recting me to leave my Post and accompany Col. <HI>Church</HI> on an Ex∣pedition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Bay of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. September</HI> following I return'd to my Post without any further Wages or Encouragement for that Service than the before mentioned Pay at the Garrison.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 1706. There was a Change of the Chief Officer at our Gar∣rison—I chose to be dismiss'd with my old Officer—which was granted.</P>
<P>1706. His Excellency Governour DUDLEY presented me a Cap∣tain's Commission, and order'd Col. <HI>Salte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stail</HI> to detach fifty effective Men, to be delivered to me in order for a March—.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1707 I entred on an Expedition to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> Col. <HI>March</HI> Commander in Chief,—at return dismiss'd.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12<HI>th.</HI> 1708. I receiv'd Orders from His Excellency to go to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> with a Flag of Truce to exchange Prisoners, and brought off all—at return dismiss'd.</P>
<P>1709. I receiv'd a Commission, and Col. <HI>Noyes</HI> had Orders to de∣tach forty Men and deliver to me, in order to join the Forces for <HI>Canada.</HI> At <HI>Hull, August</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> 1709, I received Orders from His Ex∣cellency to leave my Company with my Lieutenant, and go to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> with a Flag of Truce to Exchange Prisoners.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Desire you to Embarque on the Sloop <HI>Hannah</HI> and <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Tho∣mas Waters,</HI> Master, a Flag of Truce for <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> to whom when you are on board, you will give Orders to Sail to <HI>Port-Royal</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P>At your Arrival there attend Mr. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>percass</HI> the Governour, and give him my Letter, withal acquainting him you have Nine French Prisoners on Board, which are all that are in my Hands without reserve Receive his Direction for the Landing of 'em: And let

him know that I expect he do me a like Justice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> have all the English Prisoners within his Power, which you are to demand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on agreably to his own promise last Year by your self. Demand to have them forthwith gathered together, that you may see and speak with them, and have them delivered to you, that you be not delayed.</P>
<P>Observe to him my just Resentment of his breach upon me, in not sending them early this Spring, according to his parole of Honour the last Year by your self; when I returned him upwards of Forty, and had made Provision for the bringing home of mine: His detention of them then, puts me to a repeated Charge.</P>
<P>I expect he supply what may be further necessary for the Sup∣port of the Prisoners in their Return, as I have done for his now, and at all times past.</P>
<P>Let not your stay there be more than six Days, if possible, and hasten back with all imaginable Expedition.</P>
<P>Be not by any means diverted from your demand and expecta∣tion of seeing the English Prisoners, and that you bring them with you; unless on your speaking with them they are not willing to come, but make their Election to be Transported elsewhere; as you have seen done by your Governour here.</P>
<P>I have ordered the Master to attend your Orders. He will shew you his Instructions, and I desire you will see they be strict∣ly observed, particularly in the Article referring to Trade, and the Government of his Company. I wish you a prosperous Voyage.</P>

I told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I came with Orders from Governour DUDLEY to build a Fort, and if they dislik'd it they might aquaint him of it: and that if they came forceably upon us they or I should fall on the Spot: After such like hot Words they left us, and we went on with our Building, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it <HI>November</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI> 1715, and our Carpenters &amp; Masons left us. My Wages were very small, yet the Gentlemen-Proprietors or∣dered me only <HI>Five Pounds</HI> for my good Service &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12<HI>th.</HI> 1722. A number of Indians engag'd <HI>Fort George</HI> about two Hours, kill'd one Person, and then drew off to killing Cattle &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 1725. I received Orders from His Honour Lieut. Gover∣nour DUMMER to go ten Days March up <HI>Ammiscoggin River;</HI> and in my Absence the Indians kill'd two Men at our Fort;—I received no further Pay for said Service,—only the Pay of the Garrison.</P>

<P><HI>November</HI> 28. 1728. I was Commissioned for the Peace.</P>
<P>I have had the Honour to serve this Province under eight Com∣manders in Chief, Governours and Lieut. Governours, from the Year 1698, to the Year 1736. And how much longer my Service may continue—I submit to the Governour of the World, who over-rules every Circumstance of Life which relates to our Happiness &amp; Use∣fulness, as in infinite Wisdom He sees meet.</P>
