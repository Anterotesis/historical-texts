<P>I Have seen your pretended Answer to my Book, which ye call, <HI>The Principles of the Protestant Religion maintained, &amp;c.</HI> which I have also read and well considered, and I find that upon the matter, ye have left the substance or principal matter of it wholly unanswered, and that your said pretended Answer contains little else but Railing after an extraordinary and unusual manner of Speech, scarcely to be paraleli'd, and many very gross Mistakes and Perversions of my words, and some absolutely false Quotations and Recitations, alledging Words, and Sayings, and Doctrines to be mine and delivered by me in my Book, which are neither directly nor indirectly to be found there and which are neither my express words nor so much as the most remote true and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Ye justifie the Assemblies saying, <HI>That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Saints with Christ doth not in any wise make them partakers of the substance of his Godhead; for that would infer,</HI> as ye alledge, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, eldian</HI> Doctrine, <HI>That a Belever is goded with God, and Christed with Christ, and this is the thing</HI> (ye say) <HI>that G.

But yet the Doctrine of the Assembly is absurd, <HI>That the Saints are in no wise partakers of the Godhead of Christ;</HI> for this wholly ex∣cludes Christ and God from the Saints: If they had said, The believers and Saints are not partakers of the Godhead as the Man Christ was, in every respect, or in that respect, so as to be both God and Man, they had said well; for the difference is wonderfully great: The Union of the Man-hood and God-head of Christ is so great and so admirable a Mystery that it surpasseth all created Understanding, and shall be the Object of the Admiration of Saints and Angels, as now, so in the World to come; and this Union is not through any Mediator betwixt God and the Man Christ, but the Believers are united unto God through Christ, the Mediator; and therefore he is the Head, and they the Members, and that is Honour and Happiness enough unto them. But since the Scripture saith, <HI>That Believers at partakers of the divine Nature, and of the hot Spirit; and that the divine Nature and hot

<P>Pag. 69. Ye will not own, That Believers partake either of Christs God-head or Man∣hood; but ye say, <HI>They partake of his Graces, and they are substantial things.</HI> But all this will not help you; for ye say in the following page <HI>Grace it self is a Creature, and created Principle.</HI> Now if the Saints partake only of a created Principle or Creature, they partake nothing of God's Substance or Beeing, unless ye will say, That a Creature is any part or measure of Gods Beeing or Substance. And whereas ye say, <HI>Graces are substantial things, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Accidents, but Adjuncts:</HI> And thus ye seek to hide you from the ignorant, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of some Loicgal and School Terms and Phrases; but when ye say, <HI>Graces are sub∣stantial things,</HI> ye do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whether ye call them so properly or metaphorically, as when ye call God <HI>Light,</HI> ye say, <HI>it is not properly, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And for your distinction of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Accidents,</HI> I suppose I learned that thing ye call Logick (that ye seem to glory in) as well as ye, and do remember what is any wise useful in it, as well as ye, and I never understood, that either Logicians or Philosophers so called, did hold, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of man had any Adjuncts, that was neither

the real Essence and Substance of the Soul, nor yet Accidents; and therefore if the Grace of God in the Soul be no Accident, but the Adjunct of the Soul, it must be the Soul it self, and this is <HI>Pelaganism</HI> and <HI>Socinianism,</HI> with a Witness; for <HI>Pelagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Socinus</HI> denyed the need of any inward Grace that was not the Soul it self; for the Attributes of every being, and so of the Soul, are such Adjuncts as are either essential to that being, or acci∣dental; and for this, I can and do appeal to all who have any ordinary taste of that called <HI>Logick</HI> or <HI>Metaphysick;</HI> but I shall not insist on the School-nicity.

<HI>That the World &amp; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were the same thing,</HI> because I bring Scripture to prove, <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Saviour of the, World,</HI> Joh. 4. 42. <HI>&amp; the Saviour of the Body</HI> Eph. 5. 23.

<P>Pag 85. whereas I brought many Scriptures to prove, <HI>that the Love and Grace of God is uni∣versally extended us to all,</HI> because the word <HI>All</HI> is as expresly mentioned, frequently in Scrip∣ture, with respect to <HI>Gods Love and Grace,</HI> and <HI>Christs Death,</HI> as with respect to that damage suffered by <HI>Adams</HI> fall; and therefore as it is confessed, <HI>that all have suffered a dam∣age by Adams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all and sin, so all have received a benefit by Christs Death,</HI> and the Parallel brought by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> doth prove it, which ye say nothing solidly against, only nibble a little, alledging, <HI>that it will follow, that then all shall be saved by Christ.</HI> I Answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it doth not fol∣low, unless ye could prove, that all were eternally lost, by having a Sentence of Eternal Damnation, equal to that of the Wicked at the end of the World, past upon them; as to argue thus, <HI>the Sentence of Eternal Damna∣tion did pass upon all men, after Adams fall, and therefore the sentence of Eternal Justification hath passed on all men, because of Christ:</HI> But the Sentence that passed on all men, was not that
<PB N="93" REF="000515_0095_0FA6A9A98CEC5D68"/>
of Eternal Damnation; for it was not said to <HI>Adam, Thou shalt dye the second death, and be cast into the Lake of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire;</HI> for the Second Death, implyeth, that there was a <HI>first death,</HI> and that first Death, was only that <HI>Adam</HI> was deprived of his enjoyment of God inwardly, and his Soul became dead unto God, and Righteousness, and his body became subject to death; but this doth not infer the same de∣gree or kind of Punishment with that of the <HI>Second Death,</HI> that is inflicted for contempt of the Gospel, and final Unbelief. Therefore the Parallel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holds good, that whatever loss <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> come upon <HI>Adams</HI> Posterity, by occasion of the fall, it is restored unto all men who are <HI>Adams</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the remedy, to wit, <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who <HI>dyed for all,</HI> and if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that remedy, finally, they shall be punished with the <HI>Second Death,</HI> that is greater Punishment than the first death in <HI>Adam;</HI> and though the Remdy of Christ and his Grace be offered and apply∣ed unto all, in a day of Visitation, yet it doth not follow, that Christ and his Grace hath not sufficient Efficacy, if all are not Saved, no more than that it doth follow, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not a sufficient effectual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, to cure a Disease, because some to whom it hath been applyed, are not cured by it, though the same dose of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath cured many, of the same Disease, which pro∣veth

the end, and to the great Condemnation of them that do not beleive, and to the glori∣fying the justice of God in them that beleive not; and because of Unbelief, perish in their sins most justly, whereby they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without excuse; for if Christ had not dyed for them, they could not be guilty of <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying the Lord that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then,</HI> as the Scripture plainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: And the death of Christ hath its various effects on them that are sa∣ved; for as all are not saved at one time, nor in one Age of the World, so all do not partake of the same measure of Grace, but to some it is given, as one Talent, to some as Two, to others as Five, and yet he who hath received the Grace of God as two Talents, doth not make void the Grace of God, because he hath not received as much, as the other who had fire. And though such who are saved par∣take most plentifully of the Effects and Fruits of Christs Purchase, yet even all such who are not saved, partake of great and consider∣able Effects of Christs Death, here in this World, as that God hath spared them, and exercised much long-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards all of them, for Christ's sake, who dyed for all, and hath given all a Day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and an Op∣portunity, whereby they might have been sa∣ved; and that they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it is only their own fault; for we find, that at the Gar∣daners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fig-Tree was

Therefore neither Christs Prayer nor Death, is made void to any, but hath all its effects, that it shou'd have both to them who are saved, and to them who perish. And the Talent that was given to the evil and slothful Servant, was given him, for Christs sake, who dyed for him, and so Christs Death, was not to him in vain, and though the slothfull Servant did not improve him one Talent, yet it was not lost, but was taken from him, and given to another, and therefore nothing of the Grace and Gift of Christ is lost; and though some loose the benefit of it, as to themselves, yet that loss is sufficiently made up to another in his place.</P>

<P>Pag. 87. ye say, ye would fain know, where I place the inequality, since I tell <HI>you,</HI> that God giveth no greater measure of inward Grace to one than another, but he sute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pro∣vidences eminently. Here ye wrong my words grosly, for I deny not, but on the con∣trary, I affirm, <HI>that God may, and oft doth give a greater measure to one</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that is saved,) <HI>than to another,</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that is not saved) <HI>but it is not alwayes so, but in some cases or examples, the inward Grace may be the same both in kind and degree, in some</HI> (Note, <HI>some</HI>) <HI>that are sa∣ved, and in some that are not, at the Parable of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Marks plainly declare.</HI> Here ye may see, how I say only, in <HI>Some</HI> it may be so, but not in all; for I bring the example of <HI>Paul,</HI> who did acknowledge the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant to him, with Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus, and even in all who are saved, although the Seed or Principle of Gods Grace may be the same; as in some wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are not saved, in degree, yet the gracious Providences of God are won∣derfully extended towards all that are or shall be saved, which are not so extended unto others that shall not be saved. And the ine∣quality lyeth here, that whoever are saved,
<PB N="98" REF="000515_0100_0FA6A9AD37FFB950"/>
it is not of themselves, but by Grace they are saved, Grace hath begun, and hath carried on, and shall finish or perfect the Work of their Salvation, and they are but the instru∣ments of God and his Grace, and they have loved and chosen God and Christ, because God and Christ first did love and chuse them, and God wrought that free choice and consent in them of his free good pleasure, and thereby did not take away from them the true freedom of Will, but begot the true freedom of Will in them which before was rather <HI>bound</HI> than <HI>free,</HI> as <HI>Luther</HI> called the Will of unconverted men, <HI>Servum A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bitr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, i. e.</HI> servile Will, and not free Will. But on the other hand, whoever are not saved one time or another before the end of the World, the cause and fault is only they themselves, sufficiency of Grace and Means was afforded unto them, but they did not improve them, which they might and could have done, but did not; and therefore they are without excuse. Nor is it enough for any of them to say, <HI>If God had done as much for us who perish, we should have also been saved:</HI> It sufficeth, that God hath done enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o clear his Mercy and Justice, and render them inexcusable.</P>

<P>Ye say, <HI>That Christ hath commanded that his Gospel be Preached to all Nations, and he tells us, that so it shall be before the end of the World,</HI> is no proof of what it is brought; for the many Generations past have no advantage by that, being ended and gone, before that time comes.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> false Faith, such as the faith is of those har∣dened <HI>Jews,</HI> who generally believe not in Christ who is already come in the flesh, but in a Christ or <HI>Messiah,</HI> whom they imagine yet to come in the flesh.

<P>A <HI>Third</HI> Instances gave you of Christs A∣postles, who had not the true knowledge and faith of Christs Death and Resurrection for some time; for it is expresly said in Scripture, when Christ told them, he was to be put to Death, and to rise again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind day, <HI>They understood it not;</HI> and yet, who will say, they were altogether in a state of Damnation?

However, as to the general state of Infants, and other adult Persons deaf or dumb, and deprived of these common outward helps given to others, the particular way, method and manner of God towards them is a great secret; it suf∣ficeth, that God disposeth of them in Mercy, and doth not destroy any without sin, not only actually committed, but finally and impenitent∣ly persisted in, and rejecting the Remedy offer∣ed.

<HI>Jews,</HI> of Christ that was to come, as held forth under the Vail of the Rites and Ceremonies of <HI>Moses</HI> Law, which their Faith could take hold of, even of Christ hid under that Vail: It may be said, it could also serve the <HI>Gentiles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> for the <HI>Gentile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had a Law given them out of <HI>Noah's</HI> Family, that taught them to sacrifice to the true God; and certainly <HI>Noah</HI> taught his Posterity that these Sacrifices of Beasts were figures of Christ, that great Sacrifice, that was to come; and many <HI>Gentiles</HI> did sacrifice to the true God, as no doubt <HI>Job</HI> and his friends did, and what was <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and his friends but <HI>Gentiles?</HI> And it seemeth to have been a divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stinct put into men generally, before Christ that great Sacrifice came, to sacrifice unto God, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> said, <HI>It was proper to men to sacrifice;</HI> for the same that taught them to pray to the true God, taught them to sacrifice; and that sacrifice was the Vail to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> pointing at Christ, as it was to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that their faith might reach unto him; and though too many of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> sacrificed unto Devils, and not unto God, yet that doth not prove, they had not some sence or knowledge that they did stain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o doing, for the <HI>Jews</HI> too oft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did also sacrifice unto Devils.

for in all the Creation we see how the wonder∣ful Wisdom of God, and his wonderful Power hath united extreams by certain means or mid∣dles; and these do plainly point unto us, how as the highest and lowest Creatures are united by a certain medium or mediating nature, par∣taking of both extreams; so God the Creator and most high over all, is united with men, the noblest of his visible Creatures, by him that is both God and Man, made like to us in all things, but without sin, and therefore behoved to dye and rise again, to lay a Foundation for our Faith and Hope, that though we dye, we shall also rise again.

And though ye seek to untye that ye call, <HI>a knot, that I judge is indis∣solvable,</HI> p. 91. I judge so still, that ye shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever be able to untye it, as ye persist in your Doctrine: But yet ye pervert my words, in that ye call the <HI>Knot:</HI> for I did thus argue, That seeing Infants, by your confession, might be saved by Christ, and regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, that worketh when, and where, and how he pleaseth, Therefore might the honest and faithful <HI>Gentiles</HI> be saved by the same regenerating Spirit of Christ, who worketh when, and where, and how he pleas∣eth, and by faith in Christ. But that ye may with some seeming show, appear to loose the <HI>Knot,</HI> ye word my Argument quite another way, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Infants may be saved by the working of the Spirit in them, why may not the</HI> Gentiles <HI>be so, by giving obedience to the Light in them?</HI> And thus ye would make me appear to the <HI>ignorant</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="000515_0134_0FA6A9CD4CA5EA40"/>
as if I did plead, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were of could be saved without faith in Christ, and the regenerating Spirit of Christ, only by obedience to the general dictates of the Light within; but I say, though none are saved, but who are obedient to the Light in them, yet no Obedience can save, without faith in Christ, and the Spirit of Christ regenerating them, that is altogether necessary to every mans eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>Whereas I produced divers very convin∣cing Arguments to prove, That the Light in men that did accuse or reprove for sin, could not be some natural faculty of mans Soul; these Arguments some of them ye pass over very slightly, answering by your bare Affirmations, without proof, and some ye give no answer unto at all, nor take any notice of, see my Book, p. 119, 120, 121. which I again recom∣mend to the Readers serious consideration. I argued, That since ye confess, <HI>that man is wholly defiled and darkned, so that he is called Darkness in Scripture,</HI> therefore the Light in natural men could not be any part or faculty of their Souls; for that were to say, Men are not fallen totally, nor totally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but in part. And I further argued, That since your Confession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>All Sin is a Transgression against the Righteous Law o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God,</HI> and since the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> are sinners, this righteous Law of God must be in them, against which they transgress;
<PB N="133" REF="000515_0135_0FA6A9CD75FCC918"/>
and this righteous Law cannot be any part of faculty of the Soul, which ye confess, <HI>is wholly unrighteous and defiled;</HI> for a thing cannot be wholly unrighteous and defiled, &amp; yet in pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t righteous, holy and clean; To this I find not that ye say any thing. Ye say, <HI>I mistake, when I think ye reckon it any distinct Faculty:</HI> but the Mistake is yours, not mine; I did not think that ye do reckon it any distinct Faculty; but on the contrary, I blame you for saying, <HI>It is nothing else but the natural Conscience, or some natural Faculty of mans Soul;</HI> so that ye are wonderfully careless of what ye say; see my book, pag. 119. and your Book pag. 98. And yet ye seem to make it now, <HI>Not the natural Understanding, but something there imprinted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Well, let it be something there imprinted, this evinceth, that it is properly Gods Word; for I hope ye will not deny, but that which God writeth or printeth with his own Hand or Finger, is Gods Word, and doth as well, or rather more deserve to be accounted the Word of God, as that printed in the Bible, seeing God is the immediate Printer of this, without the Ministry of men; but the Print of the Bible is the work of Men, though the Truth there witnessed is immediately of God; and therefore by your Confession, there is an inward written or printed Word of God in <HI>Heathens,</HI> and generally in all men, and that immediately, without the use of help of the
<PB N="134" REF="000515_0136_0FA6A9CE36FD35A0"/>
Scriptures, commonly called the <HI>outward Word</HI> Hence it clearly followeth, that the <HI>Word</HI> with∣out is not the whole <HI>Word of God,</HI> nor the only Rule, in contradiction to you who affirm it. And seeing, by your Confession, the Word of God is in the <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> who have not the Scriptures, why may not the same virtue and efficacy be given to it, as to that which ye say is contained in the Scriptures? It is improper to prefer that which is writ or printed on Paper by the labour and work of Men, to that which by God immediately is printed on mens hearts and souls, without the work of men. And since ye grant, <HI>That there is a Law written in mens hearts universally, by God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Why may not that Law be understood to be the same mentioned, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 7. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, convert∣ing the Soul?</HI> yea, that it must and ought to be so understood, is clear from that analogy that the Wisdom of God in <HI>David</HI> maketh betwixt the preaching of the Heavens and Firmament, Day and Night, and the course of the Sun, and the Preaching or Testimony of this inward Law, that as universal as the outward is, so universal is the inward; for the outward in the Symbole, Figure and Type of the inward, as the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was symbolical of the inward Gospel∣Law; and if both had not been Universal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Analogy would have been improper and
<PB N="135" REF="000515_0137_0FA6A9CEF603BE58"/>
false; for the true Analogy is betwixt two Universals, and not one universal, and another particular: And <HI>Paul,</HI> by the Spirit of God applyeth the universal Language of the Hea∣vens and Firmament, Day, and Night, and Sun, to the preaching of the Gospel, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 18. by the same Analogy. Ye contradict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Scripture expresly, when ye deny it, that the Law in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> so far as they obeyed it, made them excusable; for as some had thoughts that accused them when they did evil, so they had thoughts that excused them when they did well; and this <HI>excusing</HI> of them proceeded originally from the Law it self within them, see <HI>Rom</HI> 2. 15 which ye expres∣ly contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. And for Gods inward speaking to men, most frequently without the Ministry of men or books, as outwardly, I cited divers observable places of Scripture, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 94. 10. <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 1. 16 to 22. <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> 4. 13, <HI>Micah</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>Job</HI> 28. 28. 24. 13. and 21. 14. and that noted place, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 20. from an which I did conclude, that it hath been the way of God, and ever will be, to speak to men in their hearts, to call them, and warn them, and fore-warn them of evil and danger, and to perswade and incline them to that which is good. And all these places of Scripture prove, that God doth at present, and in every Age, move and stir upon mens Consciences, and speak in them by his Word
<PB N="136" REF="000515_0138_0FA6A9CFB642B770"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Voice, as really as he did in the Prophets, tho' not equally, nor the same in all respects, and this is immediate Revelation and Inspira∣tion, seeing God doth it without the Ministry of men most frequently, even in the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and in the Wicked, when they are neither hearing men, nor reading, nor thinking on any place of Scripture; and all this ye meerly slubber over, with a bare Magisterial Affirma∣tion, saying, <HI>That it is all but the actings of a natural Conscience, under legal Convictions:</HI> But tell me, What works these Legal Convictions? doth not the Scripture say, it is God? and he doth it by speaking to them in their hearts; for God doth not use to speak to men by an outward and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Voice; and therefore there is more in men than what ye can <HI>a Reliq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in men of a natural Conscience;</HI> there is that which newly, and freshly, and immediately calleth to men in their hearts, and is a new gift and visitation of God. I find not that ye say any thing but one, that hath some shadow or appearance of weight, and that is from <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 3. &amp; <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 21. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That the Law is weak, through the flesh, and cannot give Life:</HI> And this is even that Law which was within both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> universally, and was not the meer outward Law. But to this I Answer, That by the [<HI>Law</HI>] in these places cited by you, and in many other places that could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &amp; <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. is indeed to be understood, not the meer outward Law given to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> but the Law within in its first Administration or Dispensa∣tion, that hath its proper work and service to condemn, and not to justifie, to wound, bruise and kill, and not to heal, bind up and make alive; and this first Administration of the Law is most necessary and proper, and is the real effect and work of Christ in his in∣ward appearance in mens hearts, as a Law∣giver and judge, but not so properly, not clearly, nor distinctly as a Saviour, as he ap∣peareth in his second Administration perfectly to save the Soul, and deliver it from Sin, and Wrath, and perfectly to restore and renew it into the Conformity of his own Image, by faith in him, the whole Christ, intire and un∣divided, both as he came in the flesh, suffered Death for our sins, rose again, &amp;c. ascended into Heaven, and is now in Heaven, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣tercessor and Advocate with the Father, and as he cometh in Spirit.</P>
<P>And of this two fold <HI>Administration</HI> of Christ, <HI>first,</HI> as a <HI>Law-giver, secondly,</HI> as a perfect Saviour, <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI> were Types; <HI>Moses</HI> was a type of Christ, in his <HI>first</HI> Ministration, and <HI>Joshua</HI> was a type of him, as a perfect saviour in his second Ministration, both which are inward; for though the true <HI>Chri∣stian Faith,</HI> respecteth Christ come in the flesh

without us, and now glorified in Heaven, in the glorified nature of Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the Mystery of this, and the worth of his <HI>Death</HI> and Intercession, must be inwardly opened and revealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by the Spirit of Christ: And as <HI>Moses</HI> led the People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> through the red Sea, and through the Wilderness, and brought them to <HI>Jordan,</HI> and the borders of the good Land, and no further, and than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Joshua</HI> was raised up, to bring them beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> into the good Land; there∣fore <HI>Moses</HI> begun the work, but <HI>Joshua</HI> finish∣ed it: Which two are plain figures of the two fold inward Ministration of Christ, the one that is more <HI>Legal</HI> than Evangelical, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h the Evangelical; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it, but not clear∣ly revealed, the other that is clearly and ap∣parently <HI>Evangelical;</HI> and because the second inward Ministration of Christ in mens hearts doth not appear at first, in its fulness of vi∣gor and strength, but gradually, therefore there is a mixture of the first &amp; second, which is a middle Dispensation, consisting of both; and this is well known and experienced by spi∣ritual Travellers, although to you it is a Mystery and a Riddle, that ye mock at, rather than enquire into. And concerning this di∣ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty of inward Dispensations and Ministra∣tions, both having one Author, to wit, the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> not only the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> but many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and juditious <HI>Pro∣testants</HI>

<PB N="140" REF="000515_0142_0FA6A9D2B56FA830"/>
which showeth great Partiality in you; and that we would <HI>evaporate the Gospel into Allego∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies and Dispensations,</HI> as ye phrase it. But ye are greatly mistaken; although we own the due and moderate use of Allegories, well war∣ranted by <HI>Paul</HI> and the other Apostles, and Prophets, and by good <HI>Christian writers</HI> in all Ages, yet we place not the Gospel in the meer Allegory or Figure, that is but the Shell; the Substance is the inward kirnel, hid under the Shell. And for variety of Dispensations, the Scripture is plain and express, and men∣tioneth the <HI>Dispensation of the fulness of Time,</HI> when Christ after his Death, and Resurrecti∣on, gave the holy Ghost to all true Believers, as the more excellent, far exceeding any for∣mer Dispensation, when Christ was the My∣stery hid in great part, from Ages and Gene∣rations, and not so revealed, as when the <HI>full∣ness of Time</HI> came. And ye your selves hold forth differing Dispensations of Grace, if any Credit can be given to your words, pag. 87. where ye say, <HI>We thought there had been diffe∣rent Dispensations of Grace clearly intimated, Rom.</HI> 11. 7. Whereby ye plainly insinuate, That even such who are not saved, are under a Dispensation of Grace; and yet this, tho' affirmed by us, is denyed by you, who restrict the Grace of God only to such who are saved; so ye <HI>say and unsay the same thing,</HI> little heeding what ye say; and though ye blame me for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his,
<PB N="141" REF="000515_0143_0FA6A9D37685B3E0"/>
ye are guilty of it, and not I; for I doubt not but that I can well defend all my Sayings to be well consistent one with another. And not∣withstanding that I readily grant unto you, yea, and plead for it, as much as any, that the <HI>first Administration</HI> of Christ and God, in mens hearts, is weak, and is not sufficient of it self to justifie and save with eternal Salvation, and to give eternal Life, without the <HI>second,</HI> that is to follow, which giveth faith in Christ, as come in the flesh, dead and raised again, and more abundant Grace that doth accompany that Faith and Knowledge of Christ, as such, yet all this nothing serveth your turn in the least; for we never asserted the sufficiency of the <HI>first Manifestation</HI> &amp; <HI>Ministration of Christ</HI> in mens hearts, as alone &amp; without the <HI>second;</HI> but as relative unto it, and as regarding it as the end of the first. And yet we still affirm, that God and Christ is at work in all men, in a day of Visitation, in order to save them, and God and Christ are sufficient to begin and carry on the work. And though <HI>Paul</HI> call the Law <HI>weak,</HI> yet it is to be considered, that he calleth it not so absolutely, or of it self, but weak through the flesh, because the flesh or nature of man is weak to fulfill it, until Christ be revealed in the second Ministration of him, to fulfill the Righteousness of the Law; And if ye were not very partial, ye might have understood, by what I charged against you in
<PB N="142" REF="000515_0144_0FA6A9D622E31B48"/>
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> that I placed not such a Snfficiency in the first degree of Light and Grace, and in the operation thereof, as did suffice from first to last; but there is a Sufficiency in it to begin some good work in men, that hath a proper and real tendency to the perfecting the Salva∣tion of mens Souls; as when a Chyru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion lanceth a Wound, and searcheth it, and wash∣eth it, that is a necessary work, and what he doth, he doth as a skillful, able and sufficient work man, and that work hath a proper and real tendency to perfect the cure; yet that alone is not enough to cure the Wound, but he must apply his Healing Plaister to it, and make several new Applications of his Medicine.</P>
<P>And though we still preach God and Christ in mens hearts to be all-sufficient to save them, yet we never said nor thought, that what is revealed or dispenced of any inward Ability, Influence or Operation of God and Christ, is sufficient for all time to come, either to <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> or <HI>Christians;</HI> for the best <HI>Christians</HI> need a daily renewed Influence of Grace, of Wis∣dom, of Life and Ability from God and Christ, to descend upon them, and come into them, and they are to wait for the daily and hourly incomes of it. And therefore the weakness of the first inward Administration of Christ, I deny not, but assert; and yet it is not weak in it self, but through the flesh; and it is weak
<PB N="143" REF="000515_0145_0FA6A9D6B84B3D58"/>
to justifie and save perfectly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but it is mighty and powerful to reprove, to judge, to wound, to bruise and to kill; and He, even Christ, and God in Christ, who woundeth, healeth; and He who killeth, maketh alive, and He who bruiseth, bindeth up, and He who maketh the Soul sick, and sensible that it needeth the Physitian, proveth the Physitian to the Soul; and such kind of Doctrine I have heard among the more sober kind of <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and some <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> Preachers have said, <HI>That</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Joshua <HI>were Types of Christ,</HI> as we say; <HI>and as</HI> Moses <HI>began a good Work, though his Ministration was weak, in comparison, and carried the People a great way, so as to bring them to</HI> Jordan, <HI>and the border of the good Land;</HI> so we say, Christs inward Ministration, that <HI>Moses</HI> outwardly, by way of Allegory and Analogy did answer unto, though weak com∣paratively, beginneth a good work in men, and carrieth them a great way, as it were to the spiritual <HI>Jordan,</HI> and to the border of the spiritual <HI>Canaan,</HI> and Kingdom, and then com∣eth the second toward Ministration, that answereth to <HI>Joshua,</HI> that bringeth them into the good Land, and giveth them their Lots and Possessions therein.

<PB N="149" REF="000515_0151_0FA6A9DAF5135F30"/>
said, Christ hath left his spiritual goods, as Justification, Remission, Adoption and Eternal Life to his Brethren, by spiritual <HI>Regeneration;</HI> and since ye deny this, ye must allow, <HI>That Christ giveth Remission, Justification, Adoption and Eternal Life to such who are not spiritually regenerated;</HI> which is a Contradiction to your own Doctrine. And your own Doctrine di∣stinguisheth betwixt Regeneration and Adop∣tion. Ye grosly abuse me, in saying, <HI>I con∣found Justification and Sanctification,</HI> alledging, <HI>I fall into down-right Popery;</HI> for on the con∣trary I assert Justification as it is opposed to Condemnation, and according to the most proper and frequent use of the word, is di∣stinct from Sanctification; as thus, justifica∣tion is Gods act of his free Grace, whereby he forgiveth the sins of all true Believers and Penitents, and accepteth and owneth them to be righteous in Christ, being cloathed with Christ and his Righteousness, imputed freely unto them, and whom he hath truly sanctified and begot into a true and real state of inward Holiness &amp; Righteousness; so that true inward Righteousness and Holiness, or Sanctification, is not the Foundation of Justification, but a Condition &amp; Qualification required, in order thereunto, and I place inward Righteousness and Holiness no other way than Faith, by which men are justified, to wit, as necessary Conditions and Instruments of Justification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="150" REF="000515_0152_0FA6A9DBB5116360"/>
&amp; all true Believers are cloathed, not only with Christ imputed Righteousness, in respect of what he hath done and suffered for them, but with Christ himself, in-dwelling, living and ruling in their hearts, making them really holy and righteous; and this is a double cloa∣thing unto them, or as the Scarlet that is of a double Die, where with all the true Children of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from above, the Mother of all the faithful, are cloathed, so that they are not afraid of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, according to <HI>Prove</HI> 31. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But all such who think, that the alone Righteousness of Christ without them, while they are not inwardly cloathed with real in∣ward Righteousness, will cover them, will be greatly disappointed. True inward Sanctifi∣cation and Justification, though distinct, yet are not divided, nor is the one perfect without the other; he, who is imperfectly sanctified, cannot, while such, be perfectly justified; Sanctification is ingredient in the Object of Justification, and so is distinct from it; for it is only the holy Man whom God justifieth by his act of his free Grace and Favour. And therefore Sanctification is in the priority of order, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not of time, before justification, as the Object is prior in order to the Act; for as God condem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth none but him who is wicked, so he justifieth none but who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and he justifieth the Ungodly from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ungodliness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> such who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been formerly

<P>Pag. 106. Ye say, <HI>It is a great mistake in me, to say, that Faith is one hand to receive Christ, and Love another;</HI> and ye further say, <HI>By Faith we receive Christ, and by Love we serve him.</HI> A very unlearned and foolish distinction; do we not serve him both by Faith and Love? Yea, and we receive him by both Faith and Love, and by both he dwelleth in our hearts. And as ye bring no proof to contradict it, so the truth of what I say is manifest; for it is the Love of the Heart and Soul, as well as Faith, that qualifieth it to receive Christ, yea, Love doth most sweetly embrace Christ; for it is the nature of Love to embrace its beloved Object; the loving Parent embraceth the lo∣ving Child, and the loving Child embracet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the loving Parent, and one Friend embraceth another Friend, and not only receiveth him

into his House, but into his Heart; and therefore one said, <HI>The Soul is more where it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reatheth;</HI> and all sensible Souls, who know in experience what it is to love Christ, will contradict you, and say with me, That by and with their Love, that he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in them, they receive Christ, they embrace him, and hold him, as well as by Faith. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too much, it is your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of spi∣ritual experience in this Love, that maketh you talk so widely. Yea, Faith, as it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> act of the Soul, and of the Will, and not a bare assent of the Understanding, hath Love and Desire in it, and belonging to the very nature and being of it, as <HI>Augustine</HI> said, <HI>What is it to believe in God? by believing, to love him, and to go into him.</HI> The virtue of divine Love doth wonderfully knit and unite the hearts of true believers to Christ, and one to another, according to <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 2. 2. and this is felt by all that have any measure of the divine Love shed abroad in their hearts; and if Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the heart to Christ, by Love it recei∣veth him, as that which knitteth the Graft to the Tree, causeth the Graft to receive the Life and Substance of the Tree into it.</P>

<PB N="153" REF="000515_0155_0FA6A9DFB168E918"/>
still I differ from you considerably; for I say in the same Paragraph, <HI>That real inward Holi∣ness and Righteousness, as well as Faith, are the Instruments whereby men are justified, yet they are not the Foundation and ground of Justification<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And as this cleareth us of <HI>Popery,</HI> so it doth not make us one with you, unless ye, and not I, give up your Cause; for ye say, <HI>Only Faith, and not real inward Holiness and Righteousness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Insi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ents of Justification.</HI></P>
<P>Pag. 107 <HI>That</HI> Paul, <HI>and other Saints re∣nounced inward Holiness and Righteousness, after believing, for being so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>struments of Ju∣stification,</HI> ye can never prove, though neither he nor they did build on them, but on Christ, the alone Foundation of Justification and of Sanctification, and all other Blessings and Mercies; and to be justified by Works, is but a secondary Justification; for inward Holiness and Righteousness planted and begot in the Soul, is before Works of Righteousness, as the Tree is good before it bear good Fruit, and as some Worthy <HI>Protestants</HI> have said, <HI>A good Tree maketh good Fruit;</HI> but a Tree cannot bear good Fruit before it be good. We are created by an inward Work of Christ's new creating unto good Works; and therefore this new Creation and work of Sanctification is before good Works outwardly wrought, in order of cause, as the good Tree is before the Fruit.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="000515_0156_0FA6A9E03A7FD868"/>Pag. 108. That <HI>Faith</HI> is used in Scripture, not only to signifie <HI>Gospel Doctrine,</HI> as ye grant, but <HI>Gospel Holiness and Virtues,</HI> by a synecdoche of the part for the whole, is clear to any who are not partial; for <HI>the just shall live by Faith;</HI> and said <HI>Paul, the Life that I now live I live by Faith;</HI> and yet certainly his Life was not only the Life of Faith, but of Love, and other divine Virtues: And whereas the Faith of the Elders is frequently mentioned, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. is St only their single Faith that is there com∣mended, or rather the whole Body of divine Virtues, whereof the Root, as it were, it Faith, as when we name a Tree by the Root, we understand the Branches included, and when we number men by the Head, we under∣stand the Body also; and <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 5. <HI>after that Faith is come,</HI> that was not the Doctrine only, but the Grace of Faith, together with all the other accompanying Graces and Virtues; and as Unbelief is put in Scripture for all other sin that men generally are under, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 32. so <HI>Faith</HI> signifieth the whole Body of the <HI>Christian Graces</HI> and <HI>Virtues;</HI> but of this ye take no notice, but <HI>pass it with a dry foot,</HI> because ye can give no sollid Answer to it, though men∣tioned in my first Book.</P>
<P>And that it may appear I am not <HI>Popish,</HI> in the Doctrine of Justification, hear the Judg∣ment of <HI>James Durham,</HI> a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Preacher, in his Commentary on the <HI>Revelations,</HI> in one
<PB N="155" REF="000515_0157_0FA6A9E10365BC58"/>
of his Digressions, where he saith, <HI>Who only place Repentance, Conversion and Holiness, &amp;c. but as Conditions necessary to Justification, and but equally necessary as Faith, and in the same respect with Faith</HI> (or in words to that effect) <HI>the are not to be ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnted</HI> Popish; and there∣fore hitherto ye cannot, nor shall find, in what remaineth, any Doctrine asserted by me, that is either <HI>Popery</HI> or <HI>Heresie,</HI> but what is de∣fended by as good <HI>Protestants,</HI> and better than your selves, and which hath the Scripture Authority to warrant it.</P>
<P>Ye say, <HI>Ye understand not the meaning of my Rant about a Christ divided, a Christ without; and a Christ with in, a Christ in Heaven, and a Christ in the Heart; we believe,</HI> say ye, <HI>that there is but one Christ, &amp;c.</HI> Here ye grosly mis∣represent my words, and pervert the sense of them, as if I did divide Christ, or hold two Christs, <HI>one Christ in Heaven,</HI> and <HI>another Christ in the Heart:</HI> Let the Reader see my words in my Book, and he will find, that I am not for dividing Christ, but blame them who do divide him, either in his Offices or in him∣self; nor do I use these words, <HI>a Christ in Hea∣ven, and a Christ in the Heart,</HI> as if they were two; but I say, it is one and the same Christ, which is both in Heaven, and also in the Hearts of his Children; and seeing ye call this a <HI>Rant,</HI> it is plain, that ye do not own Christ at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Hearts of the Saints: Let this be

And how sillily and foolishly do ye infer, pag. 135. That I hold <HI>two Christs,</HI> because I say, <HI>That by the Spirit of Christ a man is joyned both to Christ in him, and to Christ in Heaven; and if two Unions, then two Christs,</HI> say ye. But ye fight against your own shadow, I say nothing of two Unions, nor do my words infer it, more than when I say, a Graft that is grafted into a Tree is united both to the Branch that it is grafted into, and also to the whole Tree: Doth it thence follow, that there are here two Unions and two Trees? or that the foot is both uni∣ted to the Life or Soul in it, and to the Life or Soul in the Head, that therefore there are two Unions and two Heads? This shallow way of your Reasoning showeth what learned Clarks ye are.</P>

Your Answer hath no Validity, when ye say, <HI>They never had the work, of Conversion past upon them;</HI> but this is barely said: Why may not others, who have had some real beginning, like that of <HI>David,</HI> in some measure, fall into these Sins of Murder and Adultry? And surely, these who commit Murder and Adultry, whatever they have been before, may be numbred amongst the worst of men. They may say, according to your Do∣ctrine, <HI>They had the work of Conversion wrought upon them formerly, and they are Saints still,</HI> and ye cannot convince them to the contrary by your Doctrine. I say still, it would argue great Partiality (which far be it from us to think it can have place in God) that one and the same Sin is Mortal in one, and not Mortal in the other; the pure Life of Faith is killed by every gross Sin or Crime, such as Murder and Adultry; for if he who hateth his Bro∣ther

But where∣as ye say, <HI>There is not one Syllable, expresly nor consequentially intimating any such thing there;</HI> ye show your great Rashness, or Ignorance; for in the <HI>Greek</HI> (to which I did refer) the word is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Latine, <HI>Seema,</HI> and Englished, <HI>Scheme,</HI> that most commonly signifieth figure, and is expresly translated Figure, in that very place, by <HI>Pasor,</HI> a zealous Protestant, in his Lexicon, thus, <HI>Figura hujus Mundi preterit,</HI> i. e. the Figure of this World passeth away.

And how the Prayer of Unholy Men, (as ye allow your Ministers may be, that consecrate the Bread and Wine to be the Sacrament of the Supper) can consecrate, sanctifie, or make holy, even as Instruments, these Elements, is as strange a Paradox, as how an unclean thing can bring out a clean, or one contrary another.</P>

<P>P. 147. <HI>That God altered the Sabbath from the Seventh Day to the First,</HI> ye meerly alledge, without any proof, as your common manner is.

<P>And thus I have gone through all the Heads contained in your Book, relating to the Do∣ctrinal part, and have showed our agreement in every one of them, with the holy Scriptures, and also with famous Protestants, and Antient Writers, call'd <HI>Christian Fathers,</HI> except in that one matter of <HI>Infant Baptism,</HI> wherein if we differ from many of these called Antients in one thing, ye differ in another; for they generally judged it absolutely necessary to Sal∣vation, which ye, as well as I, judge an Error in them, and these called <HI>Baptists</HI> commonly, who may be judged as good Protestants as ye, deny your <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> as a humane Inven∣tion; and yet ye have no other: And if this doth not unchristian them, so nor can it us; and ye deny their baptizing into Water such, who have been baptized, when Infants; why then may ye not allow the same Charity to us, that ye, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the more sober part hoth of <HI>Pres∣byterians</HI> and <HI>Baptists,</HI> so called (tho' the more Rigid sort call one another <HI>Hereticks</HI>) allow one to another, and that we allow to the sober, and tender, and honest hearted of you both,

yea, and to such in all Professions, where the Head and Foundation is held, which is Christ? &amp; we have that Charity, that there is a sincere fort among all Professions, who belong to God and Christ, and tho' they have wrong Notions and Conceptions of some things belonging to <HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> and have not a form of found words, in delivering some matters of Faith, which is a great hurt unto them, yet they have some true inward sence of Christian Truth and Doctrine, and their faith and sence may be partly sound, where their words, where by they express it may be very unsound; for many have a right sence and feeling of things, whereof they have not a right Elocution, Utterance and form of Speech, as in Naturals, so in Spirituals, as when Men taste Honey, and their taste of it is the same, yet they differ in the Names they give it, or in some subtile and curious Questions about the Nature of it, or the nature and manner of tasting it, that is not so very material. So men may have some real sence and experience of the workings of the holy Spirit, &amp; inward divine Revelations and Inspirations, that work and beget in them some measure of true Faith, Hope, Love, and other Christian Virtues, and yet by the Pre∣judice of Education, and wrong outward tea∣ching, or ill wording of things, may give wrong Names to things, yet God forbid we should unchristian them, simply for a Mistake,

or defect in not giving proper words &amp; names to things; and yet many things of Contro∣versie, among single hearted men, lie but in words, and such should have a regard to that which is good, tender and sensible one in ano∣ther, where it is felt: But where a persecuting and malitious Spirit, and great hardness of Heart prevaileth in any, these are not to be regarded as Christians, whatever they profess.

Preaching be a means of our Conviction, any more than private Conference in your private Houses? If it be a Duty to preach to us, is it not also a Duty, when ye are desired, to dis∣course with us in private, at least before Wit∣nesses? 2<HI>dly,</HI> Ye are guilty of another great Contradiction, <HI>That because I am a Heretick, and worse, ye must not dispute with me, but reject me;</HI> and now at last ye dispute with me in Print, that is a more open way of dispute, than by word of Mouth; or can ye find any ground in Scripture to warrant you to dispute with me in Print, and yet to forbid you to dispute with me by word of Mouth?</P>
<P>My comparing you to <HI>Turkish Pyrates</HI> that hang out false Colours, ye say, <HI>holds not Parrallel;</HI> but that I can freely leave to the judicious and impartial <HI>Readers.</HI> But it seem∣eth, all your former Reasons were but made or feigned, not real, why ye refused a pub∣lick Dispute with me; therefore ye proceed to give other new Reasons, that ye think will appear more sollid. <HI>First,</HI> therefore ye begin again to say, <HI>It was not in your power to grant it it to me, to have a publick Disputation with you, without Laying your selves obnoxious to the then Government, who had expresly forbidden the Peo∣ple to take liberty of any publick Meeting together on any occasion on the week dayes, besides the usual Lectures.</HI> But to this I answer; 1<HI>st,</HI> It might have been supposed as serviceable as your Le∣cture,
<PB N="210" REF="000515_0212_0FA6AA18181EC630"/>
to have allowed the time of your Le∣cture to a publick Dispute. 2<HI>dly,</HI> If ye had given this Reason for your denyal at first, without all doubt a liberty could have been most readily procured unto you, from the then Government. 3<HI>dly,</HI> Many of the People took a sins greater liberty afterwards, not only to meet openly, without leave of your then Go∣vernour, but to do a great deal more, &amp;c. But if it was unlawful to dispute with an <HI>Incorrigible Heretick,</HI> why do ye now insinuate, that had it not been for laying your selves obnoxious to the then Government, ye would have given me a publick Disputation with you? Surely ye do greatly forget your selves, to write such Contradictions. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Ye say, <HI>Ye knew none of your Hearers had any scruple about your Do∣ctrine.</HI> But what then? Ye should be ready to give a Reason of your Hope to every one that asketh you, and to convince Gain-sayers, if they be out of the way, and ye in it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Ye say, <HI>Ye knew there would be no holding of me to any Law or Rule of Disputation, partly because a</HI> Quaker, <HI>and partly by Reports of me, and that I would bring all to my Revelations, &amp;c.</HI> But who seeth not the weakness and shallewness of these Fig-leaf Reasons? These called <HI>Quakers</HI> are known to be men of Reason, and many of them know as well as ye, how to hold to the true Laws of fair Dispute, and false Reports of me I value not; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> my way
<PB N="211" REF="000515_0213_0FA6AA18A4190EF0"/>
to bring any matter of Dispute (leaving the Scripture) to inward Revelation; but if I cannot prove the Doctrine, whereof I charged you to be false, from Scripture, I should be silent; and Ye and the Readers may see, I have not left the Scriptures, and run to In∣ward Revelations (tho' I own, that with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inward divine Revelation no man can have a right understanding of Scripture) for proof against you, but hold to Scripture and Scrip∣ture-proof, in a way of fair Reasoning. 4<HI>thly,</HI> Your last Reason is as false as any of the rest, <HI>That I had declared my self at once in opposition to almost all the fundamental Articles of Religion, which have been maintained almost Seventeen hun∣dred Tears by the Church of Christ.</HI> The false∣hood of this will sufficiently appear, from both my first, and this latter Book, to all sober and judicious Readers. And whereas ye say, <HI>Who but Mad-men would expose these to be pub∣lickly debated?</HI> Why then have ye exposed them that ye call <HI>Fundamentals</HI> (but are no Fundamentals of Christian Doctrine, but Fun∣damental Errors, that false Churches have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon) now to be publickly debated? Why do ye thus declare your selves, by your own confession, to be such <HI>Mad-men,</HI> to debate them so openly in the face of the Nations, both in <HI>America &amp; Europe,</HI> yea, much more openly than they could have been by 2 or 3 hours dis∣course before two or thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hundred People?

And that ye your selves gave the rise to this so publick way of disputing in Print, is evident from the words of your Letter, saying, <HI>If he would have a publick Audience let him Print.</HI></P>
<P>I defire the Reader to take notice, That what Testimonies of antient or latter Writers of good esteem among <HI>Protestants,</HI> I have cited in this Treatise, is not for want of sufficient proofs of Scripture Testimony, OR every head of difference betwixt our Opposers and us; for I have brought sufficient Testimonies of holy Scripture to confirm every one of these heads, as the judicious and impartial Reader may ob∣serve in both my Treatises; but because these men who are our Opposers, thinking to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der our Doctrine odious, do accuse it, either at <HI>Novel,</HI> or as <HI>Old Heresies revived by us, and as contradicting almost all Fundamentals of Christian Religion for almost Seventeen Hundred Years past, hold by good Christians;</HI> Therefore I sound it convenient to cite these Testimonies, to show our agreement, not only with the holy Scrip∣tures, but also with other Writers of good esteem among <HI>Protestants,</HI> even in these very Heads, called by our Opposers <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> that their Ignorance and Par∣tiality may appear, and their evil Design to render the Truth Odious, may be discovered.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="000515_0215_0FA6AA19368A5378"/>In the end, I desire the <HI>Reader</HI> to take notice how that after C.

That it is a Plantation for the Christian &amp; Prote∣stant Religion: You may now see a Land filled with Churches, which by solemn and aweful Covenants are dedicated unto the Son of God; there are, I sup∣pose, more than an hundred of these holy Societies among us, which would in</HI> Luthers <HI>judgment ren∣der the meanest Villiage more glorious than an Ivory Palace; in these you may see Discipline ma∣naged, Heresie subdued, Prophaness opposed, and Communion maintained, with a careful respect un∣to the Word of God in all; you may see faithful Ministers and sincere Christians, and multitudes of Souls ripening a pace for the Kingdom of God; you may see proportionably as much of God among them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in any spot of Ground which the Children of</HI> Adam <HI>walk upon.</HI> This is greatly in praise of <HI>N.

<P>If what this Writer so confidently affirmed before were undeniably true, let the Reader judge, how unlikely it is, an Epistle from Hea∣ven should be filled with such Contents against so holy a People; and for the future the Author will do well to avoid the like Contradictions.

vers. 11. <HI>The Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Priests thereof Teach for Hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for Money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not the Lord among us? none Evil can come upon us.</HI> O <HI>New-Eng∣land! New-England!</HI> is not this your present state? Are not your Priests crying Peace unto you, as if no Evil could come upon you, in the midst of these Cloudes of Dangers that are hanging over your heads? some of them you have, for more than a Twelve Moneth felt, to wit, A Bloody &amp; Cruel War with the Heathen, the loss of so many Lives hath humbled me be∣fore the Lord, and at this time the earnest Cry and Supplication of my Soul unto God, is, That you may by your speedy &amp; sincere Repentance unto him, prevent his Judgments for the fu∣ture. That the <HI>Jesuits</HI> may be properly term∣ed the Fathers of <HI>New-England</HI> Priests, none can doubt, if they differ not from their Bro∣ther <HI>John Cotton</HI> of <HI>Hampton,</HI> who in a publick Dispute with <HI>G. K.</HI> owned, <HI>To have received his Ministry by the Pope of Rome,</HI> whose Emi∣saries they are. Beside, as they can never prove the <HI>Quakers</HI> guilty of any one Jesuitical Error, yet we can prove these Priests of <HI>Baston</HI> guilty of many, and more especially in their being Incendiaries against the Peace of the Government. The further calumniating those who suffered Death, to answer your Cru∣elty, is but a mean way to expi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te the Crime
<PB N="221" REF="000515_0223_0FA6AA21760329E8"/>
of their innocent Blood, which crys aloud for Vengeance, and the Lord, unto whom it belongs will repay it. Thou <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> nor all thy Fraternity will never be able to prove these 4 Worthies troublesom Hereticks, that patiently endured Martyrdom for the Testimony of Jesus, by their crul Hands; neither will thy poor In∣sinuation help, <HI>That two or three of them would rather dye, than leave the Plantation undisturbed.</HI> They had no reason to hearken unto your Hy∣pocritical entreaties to be gone, it was their birth-right, as free-born Subjects of the King∣dom of <HI>England,</HI> and so might claim it to in∣habit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>N. England,</HI> as well as any that there resided, as not being forbid to them by either the Law of God, or the Realm of <HI>England;</HI> so that being innocent, they feared not man, that could only hurt the Body, but feared him that could cast both Body and Soul into Hell Fire.</P>

<P><HI>It is possible a</HI> Bedlam <HI>had been fitter for those Frantick People, than what was inflicted on them; and for my own part, I must profess with regard unto such Hereticks,</HI> Ad Judicium sangumis Tardussum; <HI>nor have I the least inclinations to</HI> Hereticide <HI>as a fit way to suppress their Errors.</HI></P>

<P>Here our Author doth not a little impeach the Authority of <HI>N. England,</HI> at that time, who were accessary to the Death of those 4 Wor∣thies,

by him call'd <HI>Frantick People,</HI> for if, ac∣cording to him, <HI>a Bedlam had been fitter,</HI> surely they greatly sinned in passing and executing <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> upon them; the present Go∣vernour <HI>Simon Broadstead,</HI> then a Magistrate, is greatly concerned in this Charge, which amounts to no less than the taking away four Lives by an unjust Judgment; for how can that Sentence of <HI>Hanging</HI> be just against such for whom a <HI>Bedlam</HI> had been fitter. Such as this Author renders our Friends to have been, are by the Laws of <HI>England</HI> exempted from the punishment of Death; as also, its reckoned amongst the Abuses of the common Law, <HI>That such who kill People by false Judgment, be not de∣stroyed as other Murderers,</HI> as may be seen in that noted Book, called, <HI>The Mirror of Justice, C.</HI>5 <HI>Sect.</HI> 108. in express words thus, <HI>It is abuse that Justices, and other Officers, who kill People by false Judgment, be not destroyed as other Murder∣ers, which K.</HI> Alfred <HI>cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be done, who caused forty four Judges in one Year to be hanged, as Mur∣derers, for their false Judgments;</HI> which in the said Book are particularly noted, and in the 4th Case he instances<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how <HI>King Alfred hanged</HI> Cole, <HI>because he judged</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>to death, when he was a Mad-man.

<P>The nature of the true Sheep is, that they will follow the Shepherd of their Souls, Christ Jesus, for they know his Voice, and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the Voice of a stranger, <HI>John</HI> 10.4, 5. This is the case of those our <HI>Author</HI> reproaches with the Title of <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who are known to many to be true <HI>Israelites</HI> indeed, &amp; will be manifested as such, unto many more; these knowing the voice of their Lord and Ma∣ster, cannot give ear unto the uncertain found of <HI>N. England's</HI> Shepherds, who teach for hire and divine for Money, &amp; run and are not sent. To <HI>revile,</HI> is a poor way of <HI>Reasoning,</HI> &amp; lays this writer but the more open: His Venom belched forth against a faithful Servant of the Lord,
