<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T being grown as unfashionable for a a Book now to appear in Publick with∣out a Preface, as for a Lady to appear at a Ball without a Hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to Custom for Fashion sake, and not through any Necessity. The Subject being both common and univer∣sal, needs no Arguments to introduce it, and being so necessary for the Gratification of the Ap∣petite, stands in need of no Encomiums to allure Per∣sons to the Practice of it, since there are but few now-a-days who love not good Eating and Drinking. There∣fore I entirely quit those two Topicks; but having three or four Pages to be filled up, previous to the Subject it∣self, I shall employ them on a Subject I think new, and not yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andled by any of the Pretenders to the Art of Cookery; and that is, the Antiquity of it, which, if it either instruct or divert, I shall be satisfied, if you are so.</P>
<P><HI>COOKERY, Confectionary,</HI> &amp;c. like all other Sciences and Arts, had their Infancy, and did not ar∣rive at a State of Maturity but by slow Degrees, vari∣ous Experiments, and a long Tract of Time: For in the Infant Age of the World, when the new Inhabitants contented themselves with the simple Provision of Na∣ture, <HI>viz.</HI> the vegetable Diet, the Fruits and Produc∣tions of the teeming Ground, as they succeeded one ano∣ther in their several peculiar Seasons, the Art of Cocke∣ry
<PB REF="005061_0003_101698E6540DDD88"/>
was unknown; Apples, Nuts, and Herbs were both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Sauce, and Mankind stood in no need of any additional Sauces, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>goes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but a good Appetite; which a healthful and vigorous Constitution, a clear, wholesome, odoriferous Air, moderate Exercise, and an Exemption fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m anxious Cares, always supplied them with.</P>
<P>WE read of no palled Appetites, but such as proceeded from the Decays of Nature, by reason of an advanced old Age; but on the contrary, a craving Stomach, even up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a Death bed, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Isaac;</HI> nor no Sicknesses but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were both the first and the last, which pro∣ceeded from the Struggles of Nature, which abhorred the Diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lution of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; no Physicians to prescribe for the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k, nor no Apothecaries to compound Medicine for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o Thousand Years and upwards. Food and Physick were then one and the same Thing.</P>
<P>BUT when Men began to pass from a Vegetable to an Animal Diet, and feed on Flesh, Fowls, and Fish, then Seasonings grew necessary, both to render it more palatable and savoury, and also to preserve that Part which was not immediately spent from Stinking and Cor∣ruption: And probably, Salt was the first Seasoning dis∣cover'd; for of Salt we read, <HI>Gen. xiv.</HI></P>
<P>AND this seems to be necessary, especially for those who were advanced in Age, whose Palates, with their Bodies, had lost their Vigour as to Taste, whose deges∣tive Faculty grew weak and impotent, and thence pro∣ceeded the Use of Soops and savoury M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses; so that Cookery then began to become a Science, though Luxury had not brought it to the Height of an Art. Thus we read, that <HI>Jacob</HI> made such palatable Pottage, that <HI>Esau</HI> purchased a Mess of it at the extravagant Price of his Birthright. And <HI>Isaac,</HI> before by his last Will and Testament he bequeathed his Blessing to his Son <HI>E∣sau,</HI> required him to make some savoury Meat, such as his Soul loved, <HI>i. e.</HI> such as was relishable to his blunt∣ed Palate,</P>
<P>SO that Seasonings of some Sort were then in Use; though whether they were Salt, savoury Herbs, or
<PB REF="005061_0004_1016991B54B529A8"/>
Roots only; or Spices, the Fruits of Trees, such as Pep∣per, Cloves, Nutmegs; Bark, as Cinamon; Roots, as Ginger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall not determine.</P>
<P>AS for the Methods of the Cookery of those Times, boiling or stewing seems to have been the Principal; broiling or roasting the next; besides which, I presume, scarce any other were used for two Thousand Years and more; for I remember no other in the History of <HI>Genesis.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Esau</HI> was the first Cook, I shall not presume to assert; for <HI>Abraham</HI> gave Order to dress a fatted Calf; but <HI>Esau</HI> is the first Person mentioned that made any Advances beyond plain Dressing, as boiling, roast∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For tho' we find indeed, that <HI>Rebeccah</HI> his Mother was accomplished with the Skill of making savoury Meat as well as he, yet whether he learned it from her, or she from him, is a Question too knotty for me to determine.</P>
<P>BUT Cookery did not long remain a simple Science, or a bare Piece of Housewifery or Family Oeconomy, but in process of Time, when Luxury enter'd the World, it grew to an Art, nay, a Trade; for, in <HI>1 Sam. viii. 13.</HI> when the <HI>Israelites</HI> grew Fashionists, and would have a King, that they might be like the rest of their Neigh∣bours, we read of Cooks, Confectioners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Art being of universal Use, and in constant Practice, has been ever since upon the Improvement; and we may, I think, with good Reason, believe, is ar∣riv'd at its greatest Height and Perfection, if it is not got beyond it, even to its Declension; for whatsoever new, upstart, out of the-way Messes some Humou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts have invented, such as stuffing a roasted Leg of Mutton with pickled Herring, and the like, are only the Sau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of a capricious Appetite, and debau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing, rather than improving the Art itself.</P>
<P>THE Art of Cookery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is indeed diversified ac∣cording to the Diversity of Nations or Countries; and to treat of it in that La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ude would fill an unportable Volume, and rather confound than inprove those that would accomplish themselves with it. I shall therefore confine what I have to communicate within the Limits
<PB REF="005061_0005_101698E9AFD3C640"/>
of Practicalness and Usefulness, and so within the Com∣pass of a Manual that shall neither burthen the Hands to hold, the Eyes in reading, nor the Mind in conceiving.</P>
<P>WHAT you will find in the following Sheets, are Directions generally for dressing after the best, most na∣tural, and wholesome Manner, such Provisions as are the Product of our own Country, and in such a Manner as is most agreeable to <HI>English</HI> Palates; saving that I have so far temporized as, since we have to our Disgrace so fondly admired the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, <HI>French</HI> Modes, and also <HI>French</HI> Messes, to present you now and then with such Receipts of <HI>French</HI> Cookery, as I think may not be disagreeable to <HI>English</HI> Palates.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed already in the World various Books that treat on this Subject, and which bear great Names, as Cooks to Kings, Princes, and Noblemen, and from which one might justly expect something more than many, if not most of these I have read, perform, but found my self deceived in my Expectations; for many of them to us are impracticable, others whimsical, others un∣palatable, unless to depraved Palates, some unwholsome, many Things copied from old Authors, and recommended without (as I am persuaded) the Copiers ever having had any Experience of the Palatableness, or had any Re∣gard to the Wholsomness of them: Which two Things ought to be the standing Rules, that no Pretenders to Cookery ought to deviate from. And I cannot but be∣lieve, that those celebrated Performers, notwithstanding all their Professions of having ingeniously communicated their Art, industriously concealed their best Receipts from the Publick.</P>
<P>BUT what I here present the World with, is the Product of my own Experience, and that for the Space of thirty Years and upwards, during which Time, I have been constantly employed in fashionable and noble Families, in which the Provisions order'd according to the following Directions, have had the general Appro∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion of such as have been at many noble Entertain∣ments.</P>
<P><PB REF="005061_0006_1016991CDD61F900"/>THESE Receipts are all suitable to <HI>English</HI> Con∣stitutions and <HI>English</HI> Palates, wholsome, toothsome, all practicable and easy to be perform'd. Here are those pro∣per for a frugal, and also for a sumptuous Table; and if rightly observed, will prevent the spoiling of many a good Dish of Meat, the waste of many good Materials, the Vexation that frequently attends such Mismanage∣ments, and the Curses not unfrequently bestowed on Cooks, with the usual Reflection, that whereas <HI>God sends good Meat, the Devil sends Cooks.</HI></P>
<P>AS to those Parts that treat of Confectionary, Pickles, Cordials, <HI>English</HI> Wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what I have said in relation to Cookery, is equally applicable to them also.</P>
<P>IT is true, I have not been so numerous in Receipts as some who have gone before me, but I think I have made amends in giving none but what are approved and practicable, and fit either for a genteel or a noble Ta∣ble; and altho' I have omitted odd and fantastical Mes∣ses, yet I have set down a considerable Number of Re∣ceipts.</P>
<P>THE Treatise is divided into ten Tarts: Cookery contains above an hundred Receipts, Pickles fifty, Pud∣dings above fifty, Pastry above forty, Cakes forty, Creams and Jellies above forty, Preserving an Hundred, Made Wines forty, Cordial Waters and Powders above seventy, Medicines and Salves above two Hundred: In all near eight Hundred.</P>
<P>AS for the Receipts for Medicines, Salves, Oint∣ments, good in several Diseases, Wounds, Hurts, Brui∣ses, Aches, Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which amount to above two Hundred, they are generally Family Receipts, that have never been made publick; excellent in their Kind, and approved Remedies, which have not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n obtained by me without much Difficulty; and of such Efficacy in Dis∣tempers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which they are appropriated, that they have cured when all other Means have failed; and a few of them which I have communicated to a Friend, have procured a very handsome Livelihood.</P>
<P>THEY are very proper for those Generous, Chari∣table, and Christian Gentlewomen that have a Disposi∣tion
<PB REF="005061_0007_101698EBC64890F8"/>
to be serviceable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Neighbours, labouring under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the afflicted Circumstances men∣tioned; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly making the Medicines, and generously contributing as Occasions offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, may help the Poor in their Afflictions, gain their Good will and Wishes, entitle themselves to their Blessings and Prayers, and also have the Pleasure of seeing the Good they do in this World, and have good Reason to hope for a Reward (though not by way of Merit) in the World to come.</P>
<P>AS the Whole of this Collection has cost me much Pains, and a thirty Years diligent Application, and I have had Experience of their Use and Efficacy, I hope they will be as kindly accepted, as by me they are gene∣rously offered, to the Publick: And if they prove to the Advantage of many, the End will be answered that is proposed by her that is ready to serve the Publick in what she may.</P>
<P>THUS ends the Author's Preface: The Printer now begs Leave to inform the Reader, that he hath Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted the following Volume from a much larger, printed in <HI>England,</HI> which contain'd many Recipes, the Ingredients or Materials for which, are not to be had in this Coun∣try: He hath therefore collected only such as are useful and practicable here, and left out such as are not so, which would only have serv'd to swell out the Book, and increase its Price. He has printed the Bills of Fare exactly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they are in the <HI>English</HI> Edition; because the judicious and experienc'd in such Affairs, may the better know how to supply the Place of such Materials as are not to be had, with such suitable Things as this Country affords.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="regimen">
<HEAD>Professors <HI>BOERHAAVE</HI> and <HI>OSTERDYKE</HI>'s Re∣gimen prescrib'd for the Gout.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are of Opinion that the Gout is not to be cured by any other Means but a Milk Diet, which will in twelve Months Time alter the whole Mass of Blood; and in order thereto, the following Directions must be strictly observ'd and follow'd:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. You must not taste any Liquor, only a Mixture of one Third Milk and two Thirds Water, your Milk as new as you can get it, and to drink it as often as you have Occasion for it, without adding any other to it. A little Tea and Coffee is likewise permitted with Milk.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. In a Morning assoon as awake, and the Stomach has made a Digestion, you must drink eight Ounces of Spring-water, and fast two Hours after; then eat Milk and Bread, Milk pottage, or Tea with Milk, with a lit∣tle Bread and fresh Butter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. At Dinner you must not eat any Thing but what is made of Barley, Oats, Rice, or Millet-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eds, Carrots, Po∣tatoes, Turnips, Spinage, Beans, Peas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You may likewise eat Fruit when full ripe, baked Pears or Apples, Apple-Dumplins; but above all Milk and Bisket is very good, but nothing salt or sour, not even a Sevil Orange.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. At Supper you must eat nothing but Milk and Bread.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. It is necessary to go to Bed betimes, even before nine o'Clock, to accustom yourself to sleep much, and use yourself to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Every Morning before you rise, to have your Feet, Legs, Arms, and Hands, well rub'd with Pieces of Wool∣len Cloth for half an Hour, and the same going to Bed. This Article must be strictly observed, for by this Means the Humours, Knobs, and Bunches, will be dissipated, and prevent their fixing in the Joints, by which they be∣come useless.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="194" REF="005061_0205_10169A67A3A49A70"/>VII. You must accustom yourself to Exercise, as ri∣ding on Horseback, which is best, or in any Coach, Chaise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the more the better; but take care of the cold Weather, Winds, and Rain.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lastly,</HI> In case a Fit of the Gout should return, and be violent, which they are of Opinion will not, then a little Opium or Laudanum may be taken to compose you; but no oftner than Necessity requires. They are of Opi∣nion, that your Father or Mother having the Gout, is of no Consequence, if you will resolve to follow the forego∣ing Directions strictly.</ITEM>
