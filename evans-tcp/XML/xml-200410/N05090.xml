<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Title of this Treatise shows, there was a for∣mer of the same Nature; and the Author hopes he runs no Hazard in Recommending Both to his Reader's Perusal. He is well aware of the</HI> low <HI>Reck∣oning the Labours of</HI> Indiffer∣ent
<PB REF="006393_0003_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>Authors are under, at a Time when hardly any Thing passes for Currant, that is not Calculated to</HI> Flatter <HI>the Sharp∣ness of Contending Parties. He is also sensible, that Books grow a very</HI> Drug, <HI>where they cannot Raise and Support their Credit, by their own Useful∣ness; and how far this will be able to do it, he knows not; yet he thinks himself tolerably safe in making it Publick, in three Respects.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>That the</HI> Purchase <HI>is</HI> small, <HI>and the Time but</HI> little, <HI>that is requisite to read It.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="006393_0004_0000000000000000"/>Next, <HI>Though some Men should not find it relish'd</HI> High Enough <HI>for their finer Wits, or warmer Pallats, it may not perhaps be</HI> Useless <HI>to those of lower Flights, and who are Less Engaged in publick Heats.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>The Author honest∣ly aims at as General a Benefit as the Thing will bear; to</HI> YOUTH <HI>especially, whether he hits the Mark or not: And that without the least Osten∣tation, or any private Re∣gards.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The RIGHT MORALIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Right Moralist, is a Great and Good Man, but for that Reason he is <HI>rarely</HI> to be found.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="006393_0007_0000000000000000"/>2. There are a sort of People, that are <HI>fond</HI> of the Character, who, in my Opi∣nion, have but little Title to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. They think it enough, not to <HI>defraud</HI> a Man of his Pay, or <HI>betray</HI> his Friend; but never consider, That the Law forbids the one at his Peril, and that Vir∣tue is <HI>seldom</HI> the Reason of the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. But certainly he that <HI>Covets,</HI> can no more be a Moral Man, than he that <HI>Steals;</HI> since he does so in his Mind. Nor can he be one that Robs his Neigh∣bour of his <HI>Credit,</HI> or that 
<PB N="3" REF="006393_0008_0000000000000000"/>
craftily undermines him of his <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Office.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If a Man pays his Tay∣lor, but Debauches his Wife; Is he a currant Moralist?</P>
<P N="6">6. But what shall we say of the Man that <HI>Rebels</HI> against his Father, is an <HI>ill Husband,</HI> or an <HI>Abusive Neighbour;</HI> one that's <HI>Lavish</HI> of his Time; of his Health, and of his Estate, in which his Fami∣ly is so nearly concerned? Must he go for a Right Mo∣ralist, because he pays his Rent well?</P>
<P N="7">7. I would ask some of those Men of Morals, Whe∣ther he that Robs <HI>God</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="006393_0009_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>Himself</HI> too, though he should not defraud his Neighbour, be the Moral Man?</P>
<P N="8">8. Do I owe myself No∣thing? And do I not owe All to God? And if pay∣ing what we owe makes the Moral Man, Is it not sit we should begin to render our Dues, <HI>where</HI> we owe our very Beginning; ay, our <HI>All.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Compleat</HI> Moralist begins with <HI>God;</HI> he gives him his Due, his <HI>Heart,</HI> his <HI>Love,</HI> his <HI>Service;</HI> the Boun∣tiful Giver of his <HI>Well-Being,</HI> as well as Being.</P>
<P N="10">10. He that lives with∣out a Sense of this Depen∣dency 
<PB N="5" REF="006393_0010_0000000000000000"/>
and Obligation, can∣not be a Moral Man, be∣cause he does not make his Returns of Love and Obe∣dience, as becomes an ho∣nest and a sensible Creature: Which very Term implies he is not his own; and it can∣not be very honest to mis∣imploy another's Goods.</P>
<P N="11">11. But can there be no Debt, but to a fellow Crea∣ture? Or, will our Exact∣ness in paying those <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> once, while we neglect our weightier Obligations, Cancel the Bonds we lie un∣der, and render us right and thorough Moralists?</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="6" REF="006393_0011_0000000000000000"/>12. As <HI>Judgments</HI> are paid before <HI>Bonds,</HI> and <HI>Bonds</HI> be∣fore <HI>Bills</HI> or <HI>Book-Debts,</HI> so the Moralist considers his Ob∣ligations according to their several <HI>Dignities.</HI></P>
<P>In the first Place, <HI>Him</HI> to whom he owes himself. Next <HI>himself,</HI> in his Health and Livelihood. Lastly, His o∣ther Obligations, whether <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Pecuniary;</HI> doing to others, to the Extents of his Ability, as he would have them do unto him.</P>
<P N="13">13. In short, The <HI>Moral Man</HI> is he that <HI>Loves God above All, and his Neighbour as him∣self,</HI> which fulfils both Tables at once.</P>

<HEAD>The WORLD'S ABLE MAN.</HEAD>
<P N="14">14. It is by some thought, the Character of an Able Man, to be <HI>Dark, and not Under∣stood.</HI> But I am sure that is not fair Play.</P>
<P N="15">15. If he be so by <HI>Si∣lence,</HI> 'tis better; but if by <HI>Disguises,</HI> 'tis <HI>insincere</HI> and <HI>hateful.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. Secrecy is one Thing, <HI>false Lights</HI> is another.</P>
<P N="17">17. The honest Man, that is rather free, than open, is ever to be preferr'd, es∣pecially when <HI>Sense</HI> is at Helm.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="8" REF="006393_0013_0000000000000000"/>18. The Glorying of the other Humour is in a <HI>Vice:</HI> For it is not Humane to be <HI>Cold, Dark,</HI> and <HI>Uncon∣versable.</HI> I was going to say, they are like <HI>Pick-Pockets</HI> in a Crowd, where a Man must ever have his <HI>Hand</HI> on his Purse; or as <HI>Spies</HI> in a Garrison, that if not prevent∣ed betrays it.</P>
<P N="19">19. They are the <HI>Reverse</HI> of Human Nature, and yet this is the present World's <HI>Wise Man</HI> and Politician: Ex∣cellent Qualities for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> where they say, Witches, tho' not many Cunjurors, dwell.</P>
<P N="20">20. Like <HI>Highway-Men,</HI> that rarely rob without <HI>Vi∣zards,</HI> 
<PB N="9" REF="006393_0014_0000000000000000"/>
or in the <HI>same</HI> Wigs and Cloaths, but have a <HI>Dress</HI> for every Enterprize.</P>
<P N="21">21. At best, he may be a <HI>Cunning</HI> Man, which is a sort of <HI>Lurcher</HI> in the Poli∣ticks.</P>
<P N="22">22. He is never too hard for the <HI>Wise</HI> Man upon the <HI>Square,</HI> for that is out of his Element, and puts him quite by his Skill. Nor are <HI>Wise</HI> Men ever catch'd by him, but when they trust him.</P>
<P N="23">23. But as <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Close</HI> as he seems, he can and will please all, if he gets by it, tho' it should neither please God nor himself at bottom.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="10" REF="006393_0015_0000000000000000"/>24. He is for every Cause that brings him Gain, but Implacable if disappointed of Success.</P>
<P N="25">25. And what he cannot hinder, he will be sure to spoil, by over-doing it.</P>
<P N="26">26. None so <HI>Zealous</HI> then as he, for that which he can∣not abide.</P>
<P N="27">27. What is it he will not, or cannot do, to hide his true Sentiments.</P>
<P N="28">28. For his Interest, he refuses no Side or Party; and will take the <HI>Wrong</HI> by the Hand, when t'other wont do, 
<PB N="11" REF="006393_0016_0000000000000000"/>
with as <HI>good</HI> a <HI>Grace</HI> as the Right.</P>
<P N="29">29. Nay, he commonly chuses the <HI>Worst,</HI> because that brings the best Bribe: His Cause being ever Mo∣ney.</P>
<P N="30">30. He sails with all <HI>Winds,</HI> and is never out of his Way, where any Thing is to be had.</P>
<P N="31">31. A <HI>Privateer</HI> indeed, and every-where a very Bird of <HI>Prey.</HI></P>
<P N="32">32. True to nothing but <HI>himself,</HI> and false to all Per∣sons and Parties, to serve his own Turn.</P>
<P N="33"><PB N="12" REF="006393_0017_0000000000000000"/>33. Talk with him as often as you please, he will never pay you in good Coin; for 'tis either <HI>False</HI> or <HI>Clipt.</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. But to give a <HI>False</HI> Reason for any Thing, let my Reader never learn of him, no more than to give a Brass half Crown for a good one: Not only because it is not true, but because it <HI>De∣ceives</HI> the Person to whom it is given; which I take to be an <HI>Immorality.</HI></P>
<P N="35">35. <HI>Silence</HI> is much more preferable, for it <HI>saves</HI> the Se∣cret, as well as the Person's Honour.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="13" REF="006393_0018_0000000000000000"/>36. Such as give themselves the Latitude of saying what they do not mean, come to be <HI>errant Jockeys</HI> at more Things than one; but in <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> and <HI>Politicks,</HI> 'tis most pernicious.</P>
<P N="37">37. To hear two Men talk the <HI>Reverse</HI> of their own Sen∣timents, with all the good Breeding and Appearance of Friendship imaginable, on Purpose to <HI>Cozen</HI> or <HI>Pump</HI> each other, is to a Man of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> one of the Melancholiest, as well as most Nauseous Thing in the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P N="38">38. But that it should be the Character of an Able Man, is to <HI>Disinherit Wis∣dom,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="006393_0019_0000000000000000"/>
and Paint out our De∣generacy to the Life, by set∣ting up Fraud, an errant <HI>Im∣postor,</HI> in her room.</P>
<P N="39">39. The Tryal of Skill be∣tween these two is, who shall believe <HI>least</HI> of what t'other says; and he that has the <HI>Weakness,</HI> or good Nature, to <HI>give <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first,</HI> (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to <HI>believe</HI> any Thing t'other says) is look'd upon to be <HI>Trick'd.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. I cannot see the <HI>Policy,</HI> any more than the Necessity, of a Man's Mind always giv∣ing the Lye to his Mouth, or his Mouth ever giving the false Alarms of his Mind: For no Man can be long be∣lieved, that teaches all Men 
<PB N="15" REF="006393_0020_0000000000000000"/>
to distrust him; and since the Ablest have sometimes need of Credit, where lies the Advantage of their Politick <HI>Cant</HI> or <HI>Banter</HI> upon Man∣kind?</P>
<P N="41">41. I remember a Passage of one of Queen <HI>Elizabeth'</HI>s Great Men, as Advice to his Friend; <HI>The Advantage,</HI> says he, <HI>I had upon others at Court, was, that I always spoke as</HI> I thought, <HI>which being not</HI> be∣<HI>lieved by them, I hath preserv'd a</HI> good Conscience, <HI>and suf∣fered</HI> no Damage <HI>from that Freedom;</HI> which, as it shows the Vice to be Older than our Times, so that gallant Man's Integrity, to be the best Way of avoiding it.</P>
<P N="42"><PB N="16" REF="006393_0021_0000000000000000"/>42. To be sure it is wise, as well as honest, neither to flatter other Men's Senti∣ments, nor <HI>Dissemble</HI> and less <HI>Contradict</HI> our own.</P>
<P N="43">43. To hold ones Tongue, or speak Truth, or talk only of indifferent Things, is the <HI>Fairest</HI> Conversation.</P>
<P N="44">44. <HI>Women</HI> that rarely go abroad without <HI>Vizard-Masks,</HI> have none of the best Repu∣tation. But when we con∣sider what all this Art and <HI>Disguise</HI> are for, it equally hightens the <HI>Wise</HI> Man's <HI>Won∣der</HI> and Aversion: Perhaps it is to <HI>betray</HI> a Father, a Brother, a Master, a Friend, a Neighbour, or ones own Party.</P>
<P N="45"><PB N="17" REF="006393_0022_0000000000000000"/>45. A fine Conquest! what Noble <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> abhorr'd: As if Government could not <HI>subsist</HI> without Knavery, and that Knaves were the <HI>Usefullest</HI> Props to it; tho' the basest, as well as greatest, Perversion of the <HI>Ends</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="46">46. But that it should be∣come a <HI>Maxim,</HI> shows but too grosly the Corruption of the Times.</P>
<P N="47">47. I confess I have heard the Stile of a <HI>Useful Knave,</HI> but ever took it to be a silly or a knavish Saying; at least an <HI>Excuse</HI> for Knavery.</P>
<P N="48"><PB N="18" REF="006393_0023_0000000000000000"/>48. It is as reasonable to think a <HI>Whore</HI> makes the <HI>best Wife,</HI> as a <HI>Knave</HI> the best <HI>Officer.</HI></P>
<P N="49">49. Besides, Employing Knaves, <HI>Encourages</HI> Knave∣ry instead of Punishing it; and <HI>Alienates</HI> the Reward of Virtue. Or, at least, must make the World believe, the Country yields not honest Men enough, able to serve her.</P>
<P N="50">50. Art thou a Magistrate? Prefer such as have <HI>clean</HI> Cha∣racters where they live, and of Estates to <HI>secure</HI> a just Dis∣charge of their Trusts; that are under no Temptation to <HI>strain</HI> Points, for a Fortune: 
<PB N="19" REF="006393_0024_0000000000000000"/>
For sometimes such may be sound, <HI>sooner</HI> than they are Employed.</P>
<P N="51">51. Art thou a Private Man? Contract thy Acquaint∣ance in a narrow Compass, and chuse those for the Sub∣jects of it, that are Men of Principles; such as will make full Stops where Honour will not lead them on; and that had rather bear the Disgrace of not being <HI>thorough <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Men, than <HI>forfeit</HI> their Peace and Reputation by a <HI>base</HI> Compliance.</P>

<HEAD>The WISE MAN.</HEAD>
<P N="52">52. The <HI>Wise</HI> Man Go∣verns himself by the <HI>Reason</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="006393_0025_0000000000000000"/>
of his Case, and because what he does is <HI>Best:</HI> Best, in a Moral and Prudent, not a <HI>Sinister</HI> Sense.</P>
<P N="53">53. He proposes just Ends, and employs the <HI>fairest</HI> and <HI>probablest</HI> Means and Methods to attain them.</P>
<P N="54">54. Tho' you cannot al∣ways penetrate his Design, or his Reasons for it, yet you shall ever see his Actions of a <HI>Piece,</HI> and his Perfor∣mances like a <HI>Workman:</HI> They will bear the <HI>Touch</HI> of Wisdom and Honour, as often as they are tryed.</P>
<P N="55">55. He scorns to serve himself by <HI>Indirect Means,</HI> 
<PB N="21" REF="006393_0026_0000000000000000"/>
or be an <HI>Interloper</HI> in Go∣vernment, since Just Enter∣prizes never want any Just <HI>Ways</HI> to succeed them.</P>
<P N="56">56. To do Evil that Good may come of it, is for <HI>Bung∣lers</HI> in Politicks, as well as Morals.</P>
<P N="57">57. Like those Surgeons, that will cut off an Arm they can't Cure, to <HI>hide</HI> their Ig∣norance and save their Cre∣dit.</P>
<P N="58">58. The <HI>Wise Man</HI> is <HI>Cau∣tious,</HI> but not Cunning; <HI>Ju∣dicious,</HI> but not Crafty; mak∣ing Virtue the <HI>Measure</HI> of using his Excellent Under∣standing in the Conduct of his Life.</P>
<P N="59"><PB N="22" REF="006393_0027_0000000000000000"/>59. The <HI>Wise</HI> Man is equal, ready, but not <HI>offici∣ous;</HI> has in every Thing an Eye to <HI>Sare Footing:</HI> He offends <HI>no Body,</HI> nor <HI>easily</HI> is offended, and always wil∣ling to Compound for <HI>Wrongs,</HI> if not forgive them.</P>
<P N="60">60. He is never Capti∣ous, nor Critical; hates <HI>Ban∣ter</HI> and <HI>Jests:</HI> He may be Pleasant, but not Light; he never deals but in <HI>Sub∣stantial Ware,</HI> and leaves the rest for the <HI>Toy Pates</HI> (or Shops) of the <HI>World;</HI> which are so far from be∣ing his Business, that they are not so much as his <HI>Di∣version.</HI></P>
<P N="61"><PB N="23" REF="006393_0028_0000000000000000"/>61. He is always for some solid Good, <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Moral;</HI> as, to make his Country more <HI>Virtuous,</HI> Preserve her Peace and Liberty, Imploy her Poor, Improve Land, Advance Trade, Suppress Vice, Incourage Industry, and all Mechanick Know∣ledge; and that they should be the <HI>Care</HI> of the Govern∣ment, and the Blessing and Praise of the People.</P>
<P N="62">62. To conclude, He is Just, and <HI>fears God, hates Co∣vetousness, and eschews Evil, and loves his Neighbour as him∣self.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the GOVERNMENT of THOUGHTS.</HEAD>
<P N="63">63. Man being made a Reasonable, and so a <HI>Think∣ing</HI> Creature, there is no∣thing more <HI>Worthy</HI> of his Being, than the <HI>Right</HI> Di∣rection and Employment of his Thoughts; since upon <HI>This,</HI> depends both his Use∣fulness to the Publick, and his own present and fu∣ture Benefit in all Re∣spects.</P>
<P N="64">64. The Consideration of this, has often obliged me to Lament the Unhappiness of Mankind, that thro' too great a Mixture and Confusion of 
<PB N="25" REF="006393_0030_0000000000000000"/>
Thoughts, have been hardly able to make a Right or Mature Judgment of Things.</P>
<P N="65">65. To this is owing the various <HI>Uncertainty</HI> and <HI>Con∣fusion</HI> we see in the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Intemperate</HI> Zeal that occasions them.</P>
<P N="66">66. To this also is to be attributed the <HI>imperfect</HI> Knowledge we have of Things, and the slow Pro∣gress we make in attaining to a Better; like the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> that were <HI>for∣ty</HI> Years upon their Journey, from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> which might have been performed in <HI>Less</HI> than One.</P>
<P N="67"><PB N="26" REF="006393_0031_0000000000000000"/>67. In fine, 'tis to this that we ought to ascribe, if not all, at least most of the Infelicities we Labour under.</P>
<P N="68">68. <HI>Clear</HI> therefore thy Head, and <HI>Rall<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Ma∣nage</HI> thy Thoughts <HI>Rightly,</HI> and thou wilt <HI>Save</HI> Time, and <HI>See</HI> and <HI>Do</HI> thy Busi∣ness <HI>Well;</HI> for thy Judg∣ment will be <HI>Distinct,</HI> thy Mind <HI>Free,</HI> and the Fa∣culties <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Regu∣lar.</HI></P>
<P N="69">69. Always remember to <HI>bound</HI> thy Thoughts to the <HI>present</HI> Occasion.</P>
<P N="70">70. If it be thy Religi∣ous Duty, suffer nothing else 
<PB N="27" REF="006393_0032_0000000000000000"/>
to <HI>Share</HI> in them. And if any Civil or Temporal Af∣fair, observe the same Cau∣tion, and thou wilt be a <HI>whole</HI> Man to every Thing, and do <HI>twice</HI> the Business in the same Time.</P>
<P N="71">71. If any Point over-la∣bours thy Mind, divert and relieve it, by some other Sub∣ject, of a more <HI>Sensible,</HI> or Manual Nature, rather than what may affect the Under∣standing; for this were to write one Thing <HI>upon</HI> ano∣ther, which <HI>blots out</HI> our for∣mer Impressions, and renders them <HI>Illegible.</HI></P>
<P N="72">72. <HI>They</HI> that are least <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their Care, always

give the best Account of their Business.</P>
<P N="73">73. As therefore thou art always to pursue the <HI>present</HI> Subject, till thou hast master'd it, so if it fall out that thou hast more Affairs than one upon thy Hand, be sure to <HI>prefer</HI> that which is of <HI>most</HI> Moment, and will <HI>least</HI> wait thy Lei∣sure.</P>

<P N="182">182. An Honest Man is a fast <HI>Pledge</HI> in Deal∣ing. A <HI>Man</HI> is <HI>Sure</HI> to

have it, if it be to be <HI>had.</HI></P>
<P N="183">183. Many are so, meer∣ly of <HI>Necessity:</HI> Others not so only for the same Reason: But such an honest Man is not to be thanked, and such a dishonest Man is to be <HI>pity'd.</HI></P>
<P N="184">184. But he that is dis∣honest for Gain, is <HI>next</HI> to a Robber, and to be punish'd for Example.</P>
<P N="185">185. And indeed there are few Dealers, but what are Faulty; which makes Trade <HI>Difficult,</HI> and a great <HI>Temptation</HI> to Men of <HI>Vir∣tue.</HI></P>
<P N="186"><PB N="65" REF="006393_0070_0000000000000000"/>186. 'Tis not what they should, but what they <HI>can</HI> get: Faults or Decays must be concealed: Big Words given, where they are not deserved, and the Ignorance or Necessity of the Buyer imposed upon for unjust Profit.</P>
<P N="187">187. These are the Men that keep their Words for their own Ends, and are only Just for Fear of the Magi∣strate.</P>
<P N="188">188. A <HI>Politick</HI> rather than a Moral Honesty; a <HI>constrained,</HI> not a chosen Ju∣stice: According to the Pro∣verb, <HI>Patience per Force,</HI> and <HI>thank you for nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="189"><PB N="66" REF="006393_0071_0000000000000000"/>189. But of all Justice, that is the greatest, that passes under the Name of Law. A Cut-Purse in <HI>West∣minster-Hall</HI> exceeds; for that advances Injustice to Op∣pression, where Law is al∣ledged for that which it should punish.</P>

<P N="216">216.

<P N="218">218. Where <HI>Charity</HI> keeps Pace with Gain, Industry is blessed: But to slave to get, and keep it <HI>Sordidly,</HI> is a Sin against <HI>Providence,</HI> a Vice in <HI>Government,</HI> and an Injury to their <HI>Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P N="219">219. Such are they as spend not one <HI>Fifth</HI> of their Income, and, it may be, give not one <HI>Tenth</HI> of what they spend, to the Needy.</P>

<P N="272">272. A perfect <HI>Lottery,</HI> and meer <HI>Hap-hazard.</HI> Since the true Spring of the Actions of Men is as <HI>Invisible</HI> as their Hearts; and so are their <HI>Thoughts</HI> too of their several Interests.</P>
<P N="273">273. He that judges of other Men by himself, does not always hit the Mark, because all Men have not the
<PB N="98" REF="006393_0103_0000000000000000"/>
same Capacity, nor <HI>Passions</HI> in Interest.</P>
<P N="274">274. If an <HI>able</HI> Man re∣fines upon the Proceedings of an <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity, ac∣cording to his own, he must ever miss it: But much more the ordinary Man, when he shall pretend to speculate the <HI>Motives</HI> to the Able Man's Actions: For the Able Man deceives him∣self, by making t'other wi∣ser than he is in the Reason of his Conduct; and the ordinary Man makes himself so, in presuming to judge of the Reasons of the Abler Man's Actions.</P>
<P N="275"><PB N="99" REF="006393_0104_0000000000000000"/>275. 'Tis in short, a <HI>Wood,</HI> a <HI>Maze;</HI> and of nothing are we more <HI>uncertain,</HI> nor in any thing do we oftner <HI>be∣fool</HI> ourselves.</P>
<P N="276">276. The Mischiefs are many that follow this Hu∣mour, and dangerous: For Men <HI>Misguide</HI> themselves, act upon <HI>false Measures,</HI> and meet frequently with <HI>mis∣chievous Disappointments.</HI></P>
<P N="277">277. It excludes all <HI>Con∣fidence</HI> in Commerce; allows of no such Thing as a <HI>Principle</HI> in Practice; sup∣poses every Man to act up∣on other Reasons than what appears, and that there is no such Thing as a <HI>Straight∣ness</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="006393_0105_0000000000000000"/>
or <HI>Sincerity</HI> among Man∣kind: A Trick instead of Truth.</P>
<P N="278">278. Neither, allowing Nature or Religion; but some worldly Fetch or Ad∣vantage: The true, the hid∣den Motive to all Men to act or do.</P>
<P N="279">279. 'Tis hard to express it's <HI>Uncharitableness,</HI> as well as <HI>Uncertainty;</HI> and has more of <HI>Vanity</HI> than Benefit in it.</P>
<P N="280">280. This foolish Quality gives a large Field, but let what I have said serve for this Time.</P>

<HEAD>Of CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P N="281">281. Charity has various Senses, but is <HI>Excellent</HI> in all of them.</P>
<P N="282">282. It imports; first, the <HI>Commiseration</HI> of the Poor, and Unhappy of Mankind, and extends an <HI>Helping∣Hand</HI> to mend their Condi∣tion.</P>
<P N="283">283. They that feel no∣thing of this, are at best not above <HI>half</HI> of Kin to Human Race; since they must have <HI>no Bowels,</HI> which makes such an <HI>Essential</HI> Part thereof, who have no more Nature.</P>
<P N="284"><PB N="102" REF="006393_0107_0000000000000000"/>284. A Man, and yet not have the Feeling of the <HI>Wants</HI> or <HI>Needs</HI> of his own Flesh and Blood! A <HI>Monster</HI> rather! And may he never be suffer'd to propagate such an unnatural Stock in the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P N="285">285. Such an Uncharita∣bleness <HI>spoils</HI> the best Gains, and two to one but it en∣tails a Curse upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pos∣sessors.</P>
<P N="286">286. Nor can we expect to be heard of God in our <HI>Prayers,</HI> that turn the <HI>deaf Ear</HI> to the Petitions of the Distressed amongst our fellow Creatures.</P>
<P N="287"><PB N="103" REF="006393_0108_0000000000000000"/>287. God sends the Poor to <HI>try</HI> us, as well as he tries them by being such: And he that refuses them a little out of the great deal that God has given him, <HI>Lays up Poverty</HI> in Store for his own Posterity.</P>
<P N="288">288. I will not say these Works are <HI>Meritorious,</HI> but dare say they are <HI>Acceptable,</HI> and go not without their Reward: Tho' to Humble us in our Fulness and Li∣berality too, we only Give but what is given us to <HI>Give</HI> as well as use; for if we are <HI>not our own,</HI> less is <HI>that so</HI> which God has intrusted us with.</P>
<P N="289"><PB N="104" REF="006393_0109_0000000000000000"/>289. Next, CHARITY makes the <HI>best</HI> Construction of <HI>Things</HI> and <HI>Persons,</HI> and is so far from being an evil Spy, a Back-biter, or a De∣tractor, that it <HI>excuses Weak∣ness, extenuates</HI> Miscarriages, makes the <HI>best</HI> of every Thing; forgives <HI>every Body,</HI> serves <HI>All,</HI> and hopes to the <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P N="290">290. It <HI>moderates</HI> Ex∣treams, is always for <HI>Expe∣diences, labours</HI> to <HI>accommo∣date</HI> Differences, and had rather <HI>Suffer</HI> than Revenge: And so far from Exacting the <HI>utmost Farthing,</HI> that it had rather <HI>lose</HI> than seek her Own <HI>Violently.</HI></P>
<P N="291"><PB N="105" REF="006393_0110_0000000000000000"/>291. As it acts Freely, so <HI>Zealously</HI> too; but 'tis always to <HI>do Good,</HI> for it hurts <HI>no Body.</HI></P>
<P N="292">292. An <HI>Universal Reme∣dy</HI> against Discord, and an Holy <HI>Cement</HI> for Man∣kind.</P>
<P N="293">293. And <HI>lastly,</HI> 'Tis <HI>Love to God and the Brethren,</HI> which raises the Soul <HI>above</HI> all worldly Considerations; and, as it gives a <HI>Taste</HI> of Heaven <HI>upon</HI> Earth, so 'tis <HI>Heaven</HI> in the Fulness of it hereafter, to the truly Cha∣ritable here.</P>
<P N="294"><PB N="106" REF="006393_0111_0000000000000000"/>294. This is the <HI>Noblest</HI> Sense Charity has, after which all should press, as that more Excellent <HI>Way.</HI></P>
<P N="295">295. Nay, <HI>most</HI> Excel∣lent; for as <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> were the more Ex∣cellent <HI>Way,</HI> that Great Apo∣stle discovered to the Chri∣stians (too apt to stick in <HI>Outward Gifts and Church Per∣formances)</HI> so of that better <HI>Way</HI> he preferr'd <HI>Charity</HI> as the <HI>best</HI> Part, because it would <HI>out-last</HI> the rest, and abide for ever.</P>
<P N="296">296. Wherefore a Man can never be a true and good Christian without Charity, even in the lowest Sense of 
<PB N="107" REF="006393_0112_0000000000000000"/>
it: And yet he may have that Part thereof, and still be none of the Apostle's <HI>true Christian,</HI> since he tells us, That tho' we should give all our Goods to the Poor, and <HI>want Charity</HI> (in her other and higher Senses) <HI>it would profit us nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="297">297. Nay, tho' we had <HI>All Tongues, All Knowledge</HI> and even <HI>Gifts</HI> of <HI>Prophesy</HI> and were <HI>Preachers</HI> to others; ay, and had Zeal enough to <HI>give</HI> our <HI>Bodies to be burned,</HI> yet if we <HI>wanted Charity</HI> it would not avail us for Salva∣tion.</P>
<P N="298">298. It seems it was his, (and indeed ought to be our)
<PB N="108" REF="006393_0113_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>Unum Necessarium,</HI> or the One Thing Needful, which our Saviour attributed to <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Preferrence</HI> to her Sister <HI>Mar∣tha,</HI> that seems not to have wanted the lesser Parts of Charity.</P>
<P N="299">299. Would God this Di∣vine Virtue were more <HI>im∣planted</HI> and <HI>diffused</HI> among Mankind, the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to <HI>Christianity</HI> especially, and we should certainly mind <HI>Piety more than Controversy,</HI> and <HI>Exercise Love and Com∣passion, instead of Censuring and Persecuting one another in any manner whatsoever.</HI></P>
