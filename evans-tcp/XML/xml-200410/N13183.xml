<HEAD>SCENE, At the House of Mrs. FLOURISH.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. FLOURISH and Esq. RUNT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is a very great mortification to the gentlemen Ma∣dam,—your not permitting Miss <HI>Flourish</HI> to go to the Assembly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mean it as such Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>;—if your sex are so weak and undiscerning, as to prefer the fading, short lived, perishable trifle beauty, to the noble exalted, mental accomplish∣ments, which only are of intrinsic value, Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>;—it is fit they should be mortified.— O why has Heaven permitted our passive sex to be so long deceived and misled by the idle and ground▪ less opinion of the superior wisdom of the male sex!—in ani∣mal strength I grant their superiority;—and I have found some capable of pleasing; —but few—very few indeed capable of informing me.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But madam you will be pleased to consider, that few ladies are so accomplished as you are allowed to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>;—I am almost sick at the bare mention of the word;— it is so horribly prostituted and misapplied upon almost all occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean in this instance Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>:— but pray Mr. <HI>Runt</HI> how comes it that you are one of the managers of this motley assembly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was advis'd madam—both for my interest and safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By one of your own sex,—I dare say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was madam▪—Mr. <HI>Turncoat</HI> advis'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To keep him in countenance I suppose;— well what appearance do they make, compared to our assemblies in the seige?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="016668_0005_0F9D732DED5262F0"/>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had been there the last evening madam, only to have seen the contrast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Contrast indeed! I dare swear:—O Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>!—when shall we see such happy times again? Will they ever return Mr. <HI>Runt.</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Turncoat</HI> says he has long been afraid they never would return;—and wishes all the friends of government would do as he has done;—tack about, and make fair weather with the other side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How versatile is man▪ have you known any one of my sex on the side of government to change their opinion Mr. <HI>Runt?</HI> nay more—have we not openly, in the face of day, and in defiance of our present mock rulers—frequently visited our dear, distress'd friends in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> While the men!—you dastard men!—meanly stole there under covert of the night; and some of the highest Whigs, who in some companies have exclaimed against us, have been glad to make use of our interest for you know what purposes;—and their wives who have sometimes accompanied us, have returned more than half converted, by the gentility, address, politeness, and generosity of the Convention troops.—O my God! my heart bleeds whenever I think of the poor distress'd Convention troops:—What will become of them Mr. <HI>Runt?</HI> It is impossible they can endure such a horrid match: —Enough almost to kill our Yankies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very cruel treatment; and it is a wonder if we don't suffer for it in the end; I never could learn the cause madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>French!</HI> The cursed <HI>French!</HI> Mr. <HI>Runt,</HI> are the cause of all our misery:—This Rebellion would have been crush'd long before this, but for them—We could not have held out much longer, when they step'd in; but must have sub∣mitted to such terms as our gracious sovereign would have conde∣scended to offer; which all who know his goodness Mr. <HI>Runt,</HI> are convinced would have been just and merciful</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="016668_0006_0F9D732EA9D1B040"/>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your observations are very just madam, and I am entirely of your opinion:—And as to the <HI>French</HI>—every body says they are a treacherous crew:—I know when I was in <HI>England</HI> it was the general opinion there; and that they never would fight▪ and I don't despair but Old <HI>England</HI> will give them a drub∣bing yet.—But as to us, I think we are in a worse box than ever;—out of the frying-pan, into the fire; and all this for a trifling duty on tea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well we must wait with patience Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>; I have still hopes, notwithstanding what Mr. <HI>Turncoat</HI> says;— I never thought him much of a politician.—It was rather unfortunate for him, that he would not even suffer his daughters to go to a Whig-Assembly as it was called the winter before last; and now so warmly to engage in it; because these people are very apt to remember; and may possibly assign this miraculous change to the true motive.—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Miss <HI>Flourish,</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O Mr. <HI>Runt,</HI> I am exceeding glad to see you; I wanted to ask you a thousand questions:—What sort of an assembly had you?—Who was there?—Were the ladies very much dress'd?—How did the <HI>He-Bears</HI> (as Miss <HI>Doggril</HI> calls them) behave?—How did they handle their paws?—Could you keep your countenance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Stop! stop! stop! Miss Volubility,—not quite so fast; who do you think can answer so many questions at once?— Now Mr. <HI>Runt,</HI> can you think it possible, after all this seeming contempt for the company, that this girl cried a whole day because I would not let her go to the assembly?—Assembly! Good Heavens! It is a burlesque upon the name of an assembly:— I have no patience when I think of it:—Yet there's my sister is fool enough to go; tho' she told me she would not dance, because she could not bear to give her hand to such cattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt,</SPEAKER>
<P>I observ'd Mrs.—refuss'd to dance; but did not know
<PB N="8" REF="016668_0007_0F9D732F69F597A8"/>
the reason before:—Well I think she is quite right.—But Miss <HI>Flourish</HI> how comes it that you are so anxious to go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because there is a sett of us who agreed to go on purpose to make our remarks on the droll figures, for our diversion and entertainment when we got home.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—You are a rogue, Miss <HI>Flourish</HI> —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you observe Mrs. <HI>Bubble</HI>'s behaviour Mr. <HI>Runt?</HI> It seems to me that creature tries how ridiculous she can make herself;—the town rings with her silly speeches;— She has not a single advocate in our little polite circle. And is laugh'd at by the very creatures whom she affects to despise, but has not sense enough even to distinguish the ridiculous part of their cha∣racter.—Excuse me a moment Mr. <HI>Runt.</HI>—

<P>How do ye do ladies? Give me leave to take your cloaks:—What do you hear abroad ladies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We hear nothing talk'd of now, but the assembly, and Mrs. <HI>Bubble</HI>'s pretty speeches.—O Miss <HI>Doggril</HI>! I wish you had been in town in the seige;—then you would have seen assemblies!—Don't you remember one evening Miss <HI>Flourish?</HI> —Well tho' they are so impudent sometimes; yet they are so genteel, so easy, so careless, and so agreeable, that one can hardly be offended at any thing they say or do:— If you had been with us then Miss <HI>Doggril,</HI> you would not wonder at my turning off my Yankie sp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k▪</P>

<P>With all my heart Captain:—I really take that WASHINGTON to be a very clever fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us be silent on that subject Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>:—We have neither time, nor talents, to do it justice</P>

<P>Then all mankind beside are less; madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Flourish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have not seen all mankind Sir,—I believe Mr. WASHINGTON;—or General WASHINGTON if you please,—is a very honest, good kind of a man; and has taken infinite pains to keep your army together; and I wish he may find his account in it:—But doubtless there are his equals;— to say no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you meant that as a compliment, madam; it is really so cold a one; it has made me shiver;—I will therefore with your leave, drop the subject; and take another glass of wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Runt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, that's right Captain▪ I think there are more fit subjects for a young gentleman's contemplation in this room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still gallant Mr. <HI>Runt</HI>:—But the ladies must pardon me if I cannot readily assent to the justice of your rebuke; when I assure them, that I think such charms as theirs, would justify my

in attention to every other object, but what concerns my General, or my country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beileve we are are all very ready to pardon your inattention to us at all times.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curse your impudence▪—
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
Knowing my inclina∣tion, and particular attention to please and oblige the ladies; you say what you please without the hazard of offending:—And as you seem disposed at this time to be merry at my expence; I am extremely sorry to deprive you of the opportunity, by being oblig∣ed to leave you.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid <HI>Tab</HI> we shall be obliged to do some∣thing at last.—The gentlemen will be tired by and by: I have found already that some of them do not come so often as formerly; and when they do come, are not so ready to take a hint, tho' pretty broad; and I am really ashamed to speak plainer than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Ma'am! I am sure you have no reason to complain yet:—You remember the last time the gentlemen drank tea here, how very generous one of them was to Miss—, and ano∣ther very readily took your hint about the —, by what he sent the next day: And you cannot but acknowledge that they have been exceeding genteel to Miss <HI>Taxall</HI>:—If any one has reason to complain; I think it is poor <HI>Tab.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I grant <HI>Tab</HI> they have done very well, considering who they are; but I begin to fear that it will not last; unless we could depend upon a new set every now and then, which is so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I wish we had some other dependence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know Ma'am that I have taken in work for some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people. —But before I would stoop to work for our modern <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gentry; I had rather starve.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think Mamma that <HI>Tab</HI> is to be commended for

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't but say I commend such a spirit; It is very humiliating to people of taste and fashion, who have brought up a family so very genteely as I have, to think that any of them must stoop so low.—I am therefore determined to wait till necessity drives me, before I submit to it.—These times cannot last always. Perhaps we may see <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> again, as we saw in the siege.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>B</HI>—.</SPEAKER>
<P>We heard he was affronted the winter before last, at our not going to the assembly,—and now I suppose he is offended because we do go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard several gentlemen remark upon that affair, Miss <HI>B</HI>—, and the late extraordinary change in your Papa's conduct; not much to his advantage:—But I never open'd my lips, tho' I confess to you I think it looks odd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>B</HI>—.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Ma'am! When my Papa forbid our going to the Assembly, the winter before last; he thought the British troops would be here again in the spring following, and retake the town; and was afraid it would hurt his and our characters, if he kept com∣pany with the liberty people:—But now he thinks they will not come again:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Taxall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That may be a sufficient reason for his allowing you to go now; but his being a Manager looks as if he was really fond of such company.</P>

<SPEAKER>Careless,</SPEAKER>
<P>As I intended; faith!—it operated so violently on <HI>Tab,</HI> that I expected nothing short of an hysteric fit; her efforts to contain her rage must have been excessive, if one may judge by her horribly distorted countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid,</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I dare swear <HI>Careless,</HI> it was her natural look, which you took for such an horrible distortion</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Careless.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, <HI>Aid,</HI>—Though we all agree she is dam'd ugly at best, yet I never saw her look quite so much like the devil before. But at last she was relieved by opening upon me.—Heavens and Earth what a volley!—I stood the shock for some time; at length I pretended to be very sorry, and begged their pardon. Then ad∣dressing Tab—I had no thought of giving the least offence, said I, my dear <HI>young</HI> lady; but was really simple enough to think, that while the gentlemen were fighting, bleeding and dying for their country;—that the ladies could do no less than I proposed:—Ne∣vertheless, convinced by the force of your arguments I give up the point.—I had scarce finished before I saw symptoms of another explosion from the same quarter:—and seeing not one advocate in the room; but on the contrary, every countenance deeply tinged with the irascible; I thought it best to decamp; which I did leaving them not a little chagrined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid,</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad of it.—for between you and I <HI>Careless,</HI> I begin to be sick of such company; though I think what they say is of very little consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Careless,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is of so much consequence in my opinion; that I think it the duty of every whig to discountenance such indecent raillery and abuse, at all times and upon all occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid,</SPEAKER>
<P>If many would join in it—it would do—but should two or three only attempt it—they would appear ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Careless,</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous, or not; was I to continue here for anytime I should not hesitate to treat them with the neglect and contempt they deserve. Such a conduct invariably pursued, by those whom they
<PB N="15" REF="016668_0014_0F9D733627746EF0"/>
to despise, would soon effect a great change in their conversation and conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you are right Careless: I wish to Heaven the experiment was tried—O how I should glory in seeing the poor despised, neglected, solitary devils, looking and longing in vain for a bow or a smile, to cheer their drooping spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Careless,</SPEAKER>
<P>No man is more happy than I am, in the company of a pretty girl:—But shall selfish considerations weigh so much with a man of honour, as to take a little damn'd paracidical viper to his bosom, because it is pretty: Honour and patriotism forbid it.— O Aid! I am ashamed of the conduct of some in this town, who profess themselves whigs;—They are not barely doubtful, but in my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the most dangerous characters among you, but I shall leave you soon▪ and with less regret on this account:—Sincerely wish∣ing, that on my return, I may find a great reformation, or a thoro extirpation.</P>
<L>Blush B—! blush!—Thy honest sons bewail,</L>
<L>That dance and song o'er patriot zeal prevail;</L>
<L>That whigs and tories (join'd by wayward chance)</L>
<L>Should hand in hand, lead on the sprightly dance,</L>
<L>Or sword to sword as harmlessly oppose▪</L>
<L>As all such heroes would their country's foes.</L>
<L>Here lur'd by fashion, opp'site int'rests join,</L>
<L>And lull their cares and rage,—in cards and wine;</L>
<L>Here friends to freedom, vile apostates meet,</L>
<L>And here unblushing can each other greet;</L>
<L>In mix'd assembly—see they croud the place;</L>
<L>Stain to their country—To their Sires Disgrace;</L>
<L>Hell in some hearts; but pleasure in each face,</L>
<L>All—all are qualifi'd to join this tribe;</L>
<L>Who have an hundred dollars to subscribe.</L>
