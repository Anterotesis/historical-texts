<P><HI>February</HI> 9. <HI>Cornet Abeel</HI> came express from <HI>Schenectady,</HI> and desired that Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> or Major <HI>Wessels</HI> might be sent thither to pacifie the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were enraged that no <HI>Christians</HI> went out in pursuit of the Enemy. Upon which Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> at his own request was permitted to go that Evening. As soon as Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> arrived there, he sent out scouts to spy the Forts, and the Enemies motion, and withal to go &amp; warn the <HI>Tionondoge Indians</HI> of the Enemies coming, but they having gone 12 miles, returned, about 12 a clock at night, saying, they could not get over the River.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 10.

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 12. News was brought to <HI>Schenectady</HI> by some of the said Scouts, that they had heard firing at the <HI>Mohaques</HI> Forts, which was supposed the <HI>Tionondoge Indians</HI> against the <HI>French</HI>; which News Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> sent forward to <HI>Albany.</HI> Where∣upon Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> detached about 200 men out of the several Companies of the Militia Fuzileers and Troop, commanded by Capt. <HI>Peter Matthews,</HI> Capt. <HI>Arent Schuyler,</HI> Capt. <HI>Benj.

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 13. This morning having received no answer of the said Express, Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> sent another for Orders to march, and being pressed with the <HI>Indians,</HI> who threatened else to desert us, was forced to march the men over the River without Orders, which came about 4 a clock in the afternoon, when most of the men were got over the River. This very time we had News by our out Scouts, that the <HI>French</HI> had burnt the <HI>Mohaques</HI> three Castles, and were marched away, which Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> ordered Lieut. <HI>Young</HI> to signifie to Major <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> We marched 12 miles that evening, being 273 <HI>Christians.</HI> In the night about 10 a clock one of our Scouts came in, and told us, that 600 of our uppermost <HI>Indians</HI> were coming down; Major <HI>Schuyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> forthwith sent the same Messenger, that brought us the News, to Major <HI>Ingoldsb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and desired that Provision and Amunition should be sent after us, not knowing what the <HI>Indians</HI> might have occasion for.</P>
<P><HI>Feb</HI> 14. About 1 or 2 a clock in the morning we decamped, and marched to the small Fort which was made by our 50 Scouts, about six a clock in the morning, where we had advice, that the Enemy was not above eight mile from us: upon which Lieut. <HI>Harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> van Slyk</HI> and two Indians were sent to discover the Enemy, who brought us word, they were marched; two Indians came to us with News, that there were 300 of our upper Indians within 20 mile of us, whereupon we sent two Indians back to hasten them up, and to let them know we were there to joyn them.

<P><HI>Feb</HI> 18. Being cold stormy Weather, and Snow, insomuch that we could scarce see any Tract, our Scouts came in this Morning, which gave account that the Enemy were in their Fort, some being still popping at our People. About nine a clock an Indian tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> left the <HI>French</HI> in their Fort told us, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought the Enemy would Retreat, that they were packing up their Baggage.</HI> Upon which M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jor <HI>Schuyler</HI> order∣ed the Captains to draw out their men to march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Enemy's Fort to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p them; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame time had an account they were fled; he comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 19. About 7 a clock in the morning we had an account, that our Provision▪ were near at hand, which came up to us about nine or ten a Clock▪ with 80 men, commanded by Capt. <HI>Simms</HI>; the Provisions being immediately distributed among the men, those that were first served, were commanded away after the Enemy▪ with five Biskets a man: About four a clock, the van being commanded by Capt. <HI>Peter Matthews</HI> and Capt. <HI>Arent Schuyler,</HI> came up near the rear of the Enemy, the Scouts telling us, the Enemy were within less than an English mile; we desired the Indians to joyn with us to fall upon their Rear, till the rest of our men came up, sending in the mean time to our People, to march up in all haste, but the Indians halted, and could not be perswaded to march, the <HI>Mohaques</HI> being most unwilling, because the Enemy had dropt several Prisoners, who told them, that if they pursued them, they would kill all their Wives and Children, whom they had Prisoners; after an hours Consultation of the Indians, most of our men came up, we marched with all speed, thinking to overtake the Enemy before they got to the River side, but there being a flake of Ice in one part of the River, and all open above and be∣low, the Enemy got over before we got up: We encamped by the River side that Night.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 20. In the morning Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> resolved to march over the River, to pursue the Enemy, ordering the Officers to get the men ready for that purpose, but many of the men being wearied with fatigue, their Shoes being quite wore out, and Provisions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not able to make any further pursuit. But that which did most of all discourage us, was, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had great averseness to pursue or fall upon the Enemy, because of their Wives and Children; whereupon we marched back.</P>
<P>In this Engagement we lost four private Souldiers, &amp; four Indians, two Officers and twelve Christians, and Indians wounded; and we had an account by some of our Indian Prisoners that made their escape, that we killed of the Enemy 33▪ whereof we found but 27, among which was their Commandant, one Captain, and two others Officers, with two of their commanding Indians, and 26 wounded. We rescued between forty and fifty Prisoners.</P>
<P>Since their Retreat we are informed by divers of the Prisoners, who come home daily, that all our men Prisoners except five, have made their escape, or are set at liberty, and but few Women and Children left with them, not being able to carry the Prisoners off, by reason of their wounded men, whereof they carry thirteen.</P>
<P>As we did not hear, so we could not expect that your Excellency should in so short time (at that season of the Year) be advanced so near us as to <HI>Schene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ady,</HI> and that so considerable Supplies could be so speedily got together: And we observed it was no small encouragement to our <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> to see your Excellency at the head of 300 men, besides Volunteers, for our Relief, and theirs; of which we are all sensible.</P>

Fletcher,</HI> Governour, who have made their escape from <HI>Canada,</HI> who were Prisoners there, and have been 32 days by the way.</HEAD>
<P>THe said <HI>Cornelius Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se van den Bergh</HI> was taken at <HI>Canactagiere</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1691. a little before the Mayor, <HI>Peter Schuyler</HI> went to <HI>Canada,</HI> and <HI>Andres Caspares</HI> who was gone out with some of our River Indians last fall to hunt, and withal to see how the far Natians, called, the <HI>Turchtuicks</HI> lived, was taken last <HI>March</HI> by a party of <HI>Turchtuicks</HI> and <HI>Davaganhaes,</HI> and brought to a Castle where said Indians lived, and was there to be burnt and eat by said Indians, from whence he run away that very day he received his cruel Sentence, and was sixteen days in the Woods, and came to a place where <HI>Monsieur Tonty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> People were making a Fort, and the said <HI>Mons. Tonty</HI> and <HI>Mons. La Free</HI> brought him to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The said Prisoners say, that the <HI>French</HI> informed them, that there were ten Ships come from <HI>France</HI> with Provision and Amunition, but no men, scarce so many as could sail their Ships, that they had brought 120000 pound of Flower, and 160000 pound of Pork, also some great Guns, and two Morter Pieces.</P>
<P>That there is a Fort built below <HI>Quebeck,</HI> in a narrow Passage where Ships must pass; the <HI>French</HI> spoke of two Forts (but an <HI>English man</HI> told him only of one Fort) and twelve Guns in each Fort. They had 1600 Souldiers three year ago, of which 1000 are killed and taken; this is besides 200 Inhabitants who are killed.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Corneli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> has lived all this while at the Governour of <HI>Mont. Royal</HI> his House, called <HI>Monsieur d' Cellier,</HI> &amp; judges there are about 400 men in <HI>Mont Royal</HI> with Souldiers and all, altho' the said Monsieur <HI>d' Cellier</HI> often told them, they had 700 men there.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants seem to be much wearied of the War, and cry much for Peace, and pray that God would turn the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s heart, and incline him to make Peace, for it is his fault that all these Miseries are come upon them.</P>
<P>There is a man come over with those Ships to be Mons. <HI>d' Cellier</HI>'s Cock, who says, that the <HI>English</HI> had fallen upon the <HI>French</HI> Fleet unawares, and done them some damage, and pursued them to <HI>Brest,</HI> and if they had come but a quarter of an hour sooner, they had taken <HI>Brest,</HI> and all the Province of <HI>Brittanine</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have lost this Summer 37 <HI>French</HI> and 70 <HI>Indians</HI> at one time, going up the Falls to <HI>Ottawawa,</HI> and at a second time they lost 30 <HI>French</HI> the same way, and often times smaller Parties killed by our <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The said <HI>Andres Casparus</HI> says further, that when he came to the <HI>French</HI> House, after he had escaped from the Indians, the <HI>French</HI> tyed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m two dayes, but he being so lean and mager, having had no food all that time, but 11 Eggs he found in a Turkies Nest, and 6 Swan eggs he found in another place, so that the French did unty him. About eight days after <HI>Monsieur Tonty</HI> came (who is in the manner of a Governour among them) and he went down with said <HI>Tonty</HI> to <HI>Ottawawa,</HI> which was 200 Leagues from that place; the said <HI>Tonty</HI> depatched about 25 or 30 great

They stopt said Company till <HI>M. Tonty</HI> sent for them back, and resolved to go to <HI>Canada</HI> with 200 men Indians and French without Beavers, in which Company the said <HI>Andres Casparus</HI> came, being reckoned 300 Leagues between <HI>Ottawawa</HI> and <HI>Canada.</HI> As soon as the said <HI>Andries</HI> came to <HI>Mont Royal, M. Tonty</HI> delivered him to the Governour of <HI>Mont Royal,</HI> who put him in Prison four days, and then released him to work in his House; but as soon as he got out, consulted with his Comrade <HI>Cornelis</HI> to run away, which they did accordingly. After they had been about a moneth or five weeks together in said <HI>M. d' Celliers</HI> house, the said <HI>Andries</HI> says, he saw a great prodigious Quantity of Beavers at <HI>Ottawawa</HI>; an Inhabitant of <HI>Canada,</HI> called <HI>Jaques de Tallie,</HI> told him, he had 3000 Beaver of his own there, and that there was as many Beavers now in <HI>Ottawawa</HI> as would load 200 Canows to <HI>Canada,</HI> and each Canow generally holds nine or ten hundred Beavers; which the said <HI>Andries</HI> doth credibly believe to be true, there being none gone from thence to <HI>Canada</HI> in a great while.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unknown to some of you, that I came last <HI>October</HI> into these parts upon no other occasion than to view the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onteers, and put them in the best posture I could, to secure us and you, from the Attempts of the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indian</HI> our Enemies and yours. And in order to this I sent a supply of Amunition, Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lary, and Christian Souldiers, sufficient to prevent any Insult from our Enemies, and it had the effect I expected, for they durst not face the weakest of our Garrisons. I came now for your Relief, and have lost no time; the same day that I had an ac∣count from hence that our Enemies were in this Country, I put my self on board a Sloop, and brought with me 150 Christian Souldiers, besides Volunteers, and arri∣ved here before I could be expected; I then immediately marched to <HI>Schen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctady,</HI> from whence I sent you supplies of 200 and odd men, Amunition, Provision, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with which those that joyned you before, under the Command of Major <HI>Schuyler,</HI> might have secured an entire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictory, and prevented the <HI>French</HI> and their Indians from any possibility of getting back to their own houses, but it has pleased God to order it otherwise. I had also 200 Christians more upon their march, who arrived here, and would have been a considerable Reinforcement to us, but the Action be∣ing over, I commanded them back to their former Residence, till further Orders. It is obvious to me, and I believe to you all, that this Calamity is fallen on you by your own faults. I could never suppose my Brethren, the <HI>Mohaques,</HI> would be so supine and careless, as to suffer the <HI>French,</HI> and their Indians to enter their Castles without the least Resistance. These men that have an Enemy near, must sleep with Arms in their Hands, and one eye open, that is, they must keep Scouts and Spyes, so as never to become a prey to their Enemies, by their own negligence. I must advise you, that for the future, you keep strict watch, so that I may have timely notice of the Enemy's motion, and you will then see how easily they will be defeated.</P>
<P>I hope it is now apparent to you, that the great of King of <HI>England</HI> is ready to apply his Arms for your defence, when you consider, that in a very few days I am come personally to your Assistance, with near 400 Christian Souldiers. I have had the Honour to bear Command under the great <HI>King of England,</HI> my Master▪ where I have seen the <HI>French</HI> fly before his victorious Arms; and last Summer it pleased God to add to his Victories, by the defeat and destruction of their Fleet, in which most of their Ships were burnt or sunk.</P>
<P>I came now in great haste▪ and brought no Presents with me, but design (by the blessing of God) to be with you at the beginning of Summer, to give you some∣thing to wipe off your Tears for the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren that are lately lost, to renew the antient Covenant Chain, and to give you further A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surances of the Great King of

<P>My p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent care now is, to provide for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nation, about which I have given my directions to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> who will appoint them a place for their Residence; I have also ordered some Corn for their present support, which they will receive from him. I must add, that it concerns your Honour &amp; Reputation to make some brisk attempt upon our Enemies, and this with what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and expedition you can, that those People may see you retain the antient Courage of your Ancestors, and I do not question but God will give you success by a severe Revenge on our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemies and yours.</P>
<P>I am informed, that your Young Men have killed the Horses of some Christian Souldiers, who were upon the same service with you (it is not Brotherly) and I desire for the future, you will take care to prevent such Outrage, that the antient Covenant Chain may be preserved inviolably on your parts, as it will be on the part of my Master, the great King.</P>
<P>To conclude, I must tell you, that I doubt there is some false Brother among us, who keeps intelligence with our Enemies, concealing their designs, and exposing ours; if you have one French man among you, he will be true to his Country▪ by betraying you. I have order'd you some Bread and Bear, and desire you will drink the Heal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of my great Mr. and Mrs the Victorious King and most Illustrous Queen of <HI>Great Brittain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and all their Majesties Territories in <HI>America</HI>; and so bid you farewell.</P>

<P><HI>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</HI> We return you our hearty Thanks, that y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon any occasion, and for the good adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce to be watchfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keep our good scout and spyes; it is probable▪ that we would have done a great deal more damage to the Enemy had we been so well provided with all sorts of Amunit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, as the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> are▪ but some of our men have Guns, and no Powder nor Ball, and some but Bows and Arrows, as Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> saw, when we came up to him; but the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernour of <HI>Canada</HI> supplies his <HI>Indians</HI> with all sorts of Arms and Amunition, which we found now when we engaged them.</P>
<P>We pray you, <HI>Great Swift Arrow,</HI> to have a careful Eye over us, since this party of the <HI>French</HI> that has destroyed the <HI>Mohaques</HI> Castles, is but part of his strength, he is working with the <HI>Otta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awa</HI> and <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aes Indians,</HI> where he has a great Ma∣gazeen, and supplies them with all sorts of Amunition, and we fear that that force will come down upon us still.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, Great swift Arrow,</HI> We retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you thanks for remembring our dead, and that you will condole their death, when you come up in the beginning of Summer, but you can expect no Return from us, being in so mean a capacity and condition.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</HI> You inform us of the great Victory that our Lord of Lords (meaning the great King of <HI>England</HI>) has got upon the <HI>French,</HI> the common Enemy at Sea, which is admirable, and all the Nations are heartily rejoyced at it, and we hope that the great God that has his Seat above the Heavens, will give the same success to our great Lord of Lords Arms in this part of the World, over his and our Enemies, the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>We pray that you would be pleased to acquaint our great Lord of Lords▪ who lives over the great great Lake, of our mean Condition, and what p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture we are in, and how easy it is to destroy <HI>Canada,</HI> if all our great Lord of Lords subjects in these Collonies would unite and joyn together, with some Ships that carry great Guns, which our great Lord of Lords can easily spare us, after this late Victory over the <HI>French</HI> at Sea.</P>
<P>We desire that you would be pleased to order a Smith to be with us in our Coun∣try to repair our Arms, that we may defend us from the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>His Excellency replyed, That he hoped they were sufficiently satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of his rea∣diness to assist them, and that the Force the <HI>French</HI> had now sent was the most they could make; and if they would but keep out scouts, and advertise his Excellency timely of the Enemies coming, his Excellency does not doubt, with the strength he has in his Province, to deal with the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> and all his Power.</P>
<P>The Governour granted their Request of the Smith to be in their Country to re∣pair their Arms.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother, Great swift Arrow▪</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are come to acquaint you, that one of our men has last night in a drunken fit, killed an <HI>Indian</HI> that came over from the <HI>French,</HI> at which we are much concerned, and therefore come to see how our <HI>Brother great swift Arrow</HI> resents it.</P>
<P>We desire that you would be pleased to prohibit the selling of Rum while the War is so hot, since our Souldiers cannot be kept within Bounds, if they be drunk.</P>
<P><HI>Brother great swift Arrow,</HI> We answered your Excellency's Proposals yesterday, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d not time to consult with that deliber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion as we ought, and if therefore there be any thing omitted, or if we failed of our duty, we beg that you would be pleased to pardon that omission; for we must declare in behalf of all the Nations, that we are singularly obliged to you, <HI>Brother great swift Arrow,</HI> for your so extra∣ordinary dispatch and suddain arrival here for our Relief, with so considerable a Force, the like never having been done before, whereby we see your readiness and allacrity to help and assist us. And we do also return you thanks for leaving your directions with Major <HI>Schuyler</HI> to take care of the <HI>Moh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quas</HI> Nation. We are thank∣full for your kind expressions, to be so ready to come for our Relief, and that you warn us to come and acquaint you as soon as we see the Enemy a coming a far off, not doubting of your Power to protect us, since we have seen a sufficient proof of that already by this late Expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Brother great swift</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> make a narrow enquiry as soon as we come into our Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntry, about the <HI>French</HI> Prisoners, who we supect may betray us: we have had two bouts with the <HI>Onedeys</HI> about the Priest <HI>Milet</HI> that is among them, and we intend to try the third time.</P>
<P>We desire that you, <HI>Brother great swift Arrow,</HI> may come up as soon as the Bark is loose upon the Trees, since we have a design upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>We forgot to answer you in that business about the Young men killing the Horses, we acknowledge, its not Brotherly, but very ill done, and as soon as we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me into our Country we will take such methods that it may be prevented, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nding out them that have done it, causing them to make Satisfaction.</P>
<P>His Excellency replyed, that he was much concerned that they should exercise their Arms one against another, while there is an Enemy in the Field, and hopes they will for the future endeavour to prevent such Irregularities: That they may be now sufficiently convinced how ready the Arms of the great King of <HI>England</HI> is to succour them; &amp; that his Excellency, for his own part will never spare to expose his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erson for their security. That the Rum shall be prohibited upon their Re∣quest; and that the most he requires of them, is to be vigilent and careful, and not suffer themselves to be surprized, and then they need not fear the <HI>French.</HI></P>
