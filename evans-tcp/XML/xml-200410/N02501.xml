<P>11. And I saw a great white Throne, and him that sat on it, from whose Face the Earth and the Heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.</P>
<P>12 And I saw the Dead, small and great, stand before God, and the Books were opened: And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life: And the Dead were judged out of those things which were written in the Books, according to their Works.</P>
<P>13. And the Sea gave up the Dead which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and Death and Hell delivered up the Dead which were in them: and they were judged every man acc∣cording to their Works.</P>

first coming unto us here in this miserable Vale of Tears; I thought it very necessary to speak something of his second Coming, that those that will not be moved with the former Coming of him, which was in meer Love to Mankind, might be terrified and astonished with the latter, who tho' he defers his Coming, (as some think) having leaden Feet, because he expects Amendment, shall then assuredly find that he hath Iron Hands; who first came to be a Saviour to all them that believe in him, now comes to be a Judge, who will not be blinded, nor bribed, either with present Money, nor yet with future Hope of Reward.</P>

<HEAD>The Sum of the Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>To which purpose I have made choice of this place of Scripture, in which this Matter (as you see) is at large described, with many necessary Circumstances, most needful to be known, and learned of every one of us. For here the second coming of Christ is revealed to St. <HI>John</HI> in a Vi∣sion from Heaven, even in that manner in which the Lord Jesus himself will come at the last Day. For these five Verses contain in them a lively &amp; heavenly Description of the second coming of our Saviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ to Judgment, with all the Circumstances belonging to the same.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Parts of the Text.</HEAD>
<P>First, I will shew you who it was that writ this Book, called the <HI>Apocalyps,</HI> or the <HI>Revelation</HI> of St <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist,</HI> which our Text now treats on; and then where he writ it. First, his Name was <HI>John,</HI> which Name in the Original signifies <HI>Gracious.</HI> Secondly, the Time when it was written, and that was when he was banished for the Testimony of Christ. Thirdly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place
<PB N="3" REF="002963_0003_0FE6A8D17068AB70"/>
where he was exiled, and banished to; &amp; that was to an Isle call'd <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mos,</HI> a remote Place, &amp; most fitting for so high Contemplation, &amp; the more to be free from worldly Tho'ts. Fourth∣ly, by whom he was banished, and that was by the Emperor <HI>Domitian,</HI> who was then elected by the whole Senate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Council to be their Head. Now this <HI>John</HI> was a Disciple of Christ, and one whom he loved; he followed Christ wheresoe∣ver he went: <HI>Peter</HI> only went with his Master to the Judgment Hall, this <HI>John</HI> went with him both to the Judgment-Hall, &amp; also to the Cross, &amp; never left him till he had laid him in his Se∣pulchre. Upon the Cross Christ commended the Care of his Mother unto the Author of these Words, which is <HI>John,</HI> and was in these Words expressed, <HI>Behold thy Mother.</HI></P>
<P>This Saint <HI>John</HI> was one of the three which went always with Christ, Christ had but three Disciples with him in the Garden; &amp; this <HI>John</HI> was one; Christ had but three Disciples that went with him before <HI>Pilate,</HI> and this <HI>John</HI> was one. At the Marriage in <HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Galilee,</HI> there went but three Disciples, and this <HI>John</HI> was one. This <HI>John</HI> was he that leaned on Christ's Breast at Supper, and asked him many Questions. <HI>John</HI> always justified himself to be Christ's Disciple; for in these Words he expressed himself to be of Christ's Flock, and his Disciple. I <HI>John,</HI> a Bro∣ther of yours in Tribulation and Affliction.</P>
<P>And so I have now done with the Explanati∣on of the Party which wrote these Words which now I have read unto you in the Text.</P>
<P><HI>1.</HI> The Person of the Judge.</P>
<P>And first, if you would know with what Majesty, Power, Integrity, Severity and Terror,
<PB N="4" REF="002963_0004_0FE6A8D18A3F1F88"/>
this great Judge will come, you may see the Person of the Judge described in the first Verse of this present Text.</P>
<P>Secondly; If you would understand what Persons must be cited and summoned, who must appear, St. <HI>John</HI> saith here, <HI>he saw the Dead, both great and small stand before the Judge:</HI> All that are, that ever have been, or shall be unto the End of the World, shall be gathered together, and appear before the Throne of Christ.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If you desire to be instructed after what manner Christ Jesus will proceed in Judg∣ment? what shall be the Evidences and the Witnesses? What Jury sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll pass upon every Man and Woman? The Holy Ghost tells us, that <HI>Book shall be opened,</HI> that God will iudge, every Man by his own Conscience; for that shall give Evidence either for, or against him; either to excuse, or accuse in that Day, either to stand or fall.</P>
<P><HI>4.</HI> The Issue of the Judgment.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and lastly, If you would know what shall be the final End of all Men, you may here perceive that they whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Names are writ∣ten in the Book of Life, shall be blessed; but Death &amp; Hell, &amp; Satan, &amp; all ungodly Persons shall be cast into the Lake of Fire &amp; Brimstone for evermore: which is the second Death.</P>
<P>Now having seen the meaning of the Text, let us come to speak to the several Points one by one, in order. And the God of all Order so open our Hearts, that we may hear and under∣stand his Will▪ that our sinful Souls may be saved in the Day of our Lord Jesus.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="5" REF="002963_0004_0FE6A8D18A3F1F88"/>
<HEAD>I saw a great white Throne, <HI>&amp;c,</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis verse contains in it a notable Descrip∣tion of the Judge himself. And whereas St. <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>he saw a great white Throne:</HI> That is, Christ Jesus revealed to him in a Vision; the manner of his second Coming to Judgment; and withal commanded him to write in a Book, for the Comfort and Instruction of his Church and People for evermore.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>Here then we may observe the great Care and Love of Jesus Christ towards his poor Church and People, that he would not have them ignorant of his second Coming to Iudgment: But he doth make it known to his Disciple</HI> John. <HI>and bids him record it in the Book of God, that so no Man might be igno∣rant of it, but rather prepare himself by true Repen∣tance to meet the Lord in the Clouds.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Knowledge of the last Judgment necessary.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> Surely the knowledge of Christ's coming to Judgment is most necessary, being now so near at hand, for it was thought of, and looked for in <HI>David</HI>'s time, much more must we expect it in these our sinful Days, when we are divided among our selves, at difference in the Church, and such a Rent made in the seamless Coat of Christ: What can we expect less than that the Day drawing very nigh, which our Saviour foretold, that there should be Dissentions and Differences among Nations, Wars Abroad, Ru∣mours of Wars at Home, and such Policy and Tricks used to deceive Men, and all for their own Ends, and under the Colour of Religi∣on, as if it were possible, to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive even the very Elect: Where the Sabbath is so much prophaned and neglected on all sides; which. Day, God himself hath set apart for Praying,
<PB N="6" REF="002963_0005_0FE6A8D4356B00C8"/>
and Hearing his Holy Word? It is a Day for Praying, and not for Playing: It is not a Day for bodily Recreations. nor Sport, but to converse with God in Holy Duties; but it is too much abused with Sports and other May-games, which God forgive us for Christ's sake: And therefore this D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal Judgment was one of those six Principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that were taught in the Primitive Church, by the Apostles themselves, as one of the most neces∣sary Points to be known of a Christian. There is not one Truth in the Scriptures more ur∣ged both in the Old &amp; New Testament; than this of the last Judgment, as a Doctrine that above all others, is most effectual to awaken Men out of their deep Security, to work mens Hearts to a reverent Fear and Awe, of that Majesty, before whom they must one Day appear to give up their last Account. See the Effects of this in <HI>Paul,</HI> who <HI>knowing the Terror of the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 5▪11. How did this pro∣voke him and others to a reverence and fear of that dreadful Majesty? When in the 24th of the <HI>Acts,</HI> vers. 25. St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached unto <HI>Felix</HI> of Righteousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come, his Knees smote together, and he trembled. See this likewise in the Prophet <HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> who when he heard of the Judgment to come, saith, <HI>My Belly trembled, and my Lips quivered at the Voice, and rottenness entred into my Bones.</HI> Hab. 3.16▪ See this also in <HI>David</HI> himself: <HI>My Flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments,</HI> Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>19.120. See this likewise in <HI>Noah,</HI> of whom it is recorded, that when the Lord had forewarn∣ed him of the Judgment that was to come, al∣beit it was not nigh, but an hundred &amp; twenty
<PB N="7" REF="002963_0005_0FE6A8D4356B00C8"/>
years to come, yet he was moved with the Re∣verence of that God, which had threatned that Judgment, and was willing to use Obedience in that Duty required in framing the Ark: And as St. <HI>Austin</HI> saith, every Knock that was given upon the Ark by <HI>Noah,</HI> was so many warning-pieces to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World.</P>
<P>And what Doctrine can be more needful for these times wherein we live, upon whom the ends of the World is come, and every Man so forget∣ful of it? Yea, the Ignorance, and want of due Consideration of this Day of Judgment, the Scrip∣tures makes the Ground indeed of all Sin. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Days of <HI>Noah, they eat, they drank, they were married, and given in marriage, they planted, they builded, never dreaming of the Judgment that was so nigh at hand, until the Day come upon them as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> snare.</HI> See this likewise in those foolish Virgins that slumbred and slept, and provided not their Oil of Faith in their Lamps, for the coming of the Bridegroom. And what was the cause why that evil Servant in the Gospel fell to eating &amp; drinking, and beating his fellow Servants, but that he put from him the Thoughts of the Return of his Master?</P>
<P>Oh, how should the consideration of this, cause every Man to sit and prepare himself for this Judgment, that he may be able to stand bfore the Son of Man.</P>
<P>Now there are two things principally that hinder this Preparation in God's Children for this Day.</P>
<P>The first, Security, or careless putting off this Day of Account, that the Master will not come yet, &amp; that they have yet time enough to provide for their Reckoning &amp; Account, yet let
<PB N="8" REF="002963_0006_0FE6A8D4527382C0"/>
me tell you, we can call no Time ours, but this present time: For who knows whether he shall behold the Light of the next Day, yea, or no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and as St. <HI>Austin</HI> saith, the Day of Death is not known, therefore every Day, &amp; every Hour in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Day, we must labour to repent and pre∣pare our selves, and to observe &amp; look for this sudden Change; for who knows how soon he may have his Mutation, which every Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subject unto by Nature, although for a time they give themselves to all manner of Disso∣luteness and Prophaness? And therefore it is high time to hearken unto the Word of God. While the Gospel is so plentifully preached among us, and now while he calleth &amp; knock∣eth at the Doors of our Hearts, and would gladly be entertained; for, saith he, <HI>If any man will hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in, and sup with him, and he with me.</HI> Christ makes a Proclamation of his Love, whosoever he be, whether <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> he shall be recei∣ved; and therefore let us take this present time <HI>while</HI> we have it; for Time and Tide will stay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for none; the time past we can't call back a∣gain, it's irrecoverable; the time to come is full of uncertainty; for <HI>we</HI> may be cut off sud∣denly, as <HI>Herod</HI> was. And therefore it is good that we make our Calling and Election sure and labour with the Apostle to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling, and not to lie in Security, which is the first hindrance, in that we do not meditate on the Day of Death <HI>For after Death there is no Repentance</HI>; let us not think that God hath leaden Feet, because he is slow in coming, left when he cometh, <HI>we</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he hath Iron Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002963_0006_0FE6A8D4527382C0"/>Now the second hindrance that keeps Men from the Thoughts of this Judgment to come, is the Care of this present Life, and the immo∣derate Love of the World; Men's present Fe∣licity doth so affect them, that they will not think of another Life; Whereas did Men con∣sider, that even this Night their Souls might be taken from them, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.19. How would they husband Time, making it their chief Care to make their reckoning streight against the Day of Reckoning come, which no man can tell how soon.</P>
<P>Such <HI>was</HI> the careless Thought of the rich Man in the Gospel, <HI>which</HI> sung that lullaby to his Soul: <HI>Soul, thou hast much Goods laid up for many Years, take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry.</HI> But what became of him? The Text saith, <HI>The Lord demanded his Soul, and that very same night following, his Soul was taken away from him,</HI> and his Goods then might be any bodies: Some God takes away because the World is not Worthy of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>King</HI> 16.30. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 33. <HI>Acts</HI> 12 23.</NOTE> some again, because they are not good Stewards, and they are not worthy of the World: Such as <HI>Ahab, Agag</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI>; for bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g vile and un∣godly Men, they did not live out half their Days.

<P>Use 1. <HI>Shews the difference betwixt Christ's first and second Coming.</HI></P>
<P>Herein then we may perceive a manifold dif∣ference between Christ's coming in the Flesh, to be a Mediator and Redeemer, &amp; his second co∣ming to Judgment. His first Coming was in Meekness, Love, and great Humility, for he <HI>was</HI> laid in a Manger between two Beasts, an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: And as a learned Father doth in∣terpret it, as it were between a <HI>Jew</HI> &amp; a <HI>Gen∣tile.</HI> And we may read that Christ saith, <HI>The Foxes have bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and the Birds have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head.</HI> Where he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h himself to be the Son of Man which was his Meekness, and then his Humility and Love, in that he had no where to lay his Head. Our Sins caused all this, &amp; more than all this, for he was wounded for our Transgres∣sions, and our Sins were the main cause of put∣ting Christ to death. The <HI>Jews</HI> thought once crucifying had been enough, but we daily cru∣cify the Lord of Life again by our Oaths, in
<PB N="13" REF="002963_0008_0FE6A8E30DCDC488"/>
breaking his Commandments, and in pelleting his Sabbaths; which will make our Reckoning greater at his second coming, which will be to Judgment. Therefore let every one who reads these Words, have a Care to do well, and cease to be what they have been, and deny &amp; go out of our selves, that we may entertain this new Man Christ Jesus, and say with holy <HI>David,</HI> Ps. 51.10 <HI>Create in me, O God, a clean, Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me,</HI> so that they may appear blamless and spotless before him ha∣ving been cloathed with Robes of Christ's Righteousness, God doth not delight in the Death of any Sinner. Christ is now a Medi∣ator, and hereafter will be our Judge. <HI>Moses</HI> was God's Oracle, &amp; did deliver God's Will to the People; he went between God &amp; the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> as Christ had done between his Father and us sinful Men, and as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> pleaded for the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> unto God, and desired rather to be blotted out of the Book of Life, than that they should perish; so likewise hath Christ pleaded with God, and hath bought with his gracious Blood and Life, which he willingly laid down for our sakes; and as <HI>Moses</HI> led the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> thro' the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> even so hath Christ led us thro' the <HI>Red Sea</HI> of his Blood, <HI>which</HI> is a full Satisfaction for all such as truly re∣pent of their Sins. And so much by the <HI>way</HI> to <HI>shew</HI> unto you the Humility &amp; great Love <HI>which</HI> our blessed Saviour bore to Mankind at his first coming to us in the Flesh; for he so loved us, that he laid <HI>down</HI> his Life for our sakes; and shall <HI>we</HI> be so ungrateful, as not to love him again, and give him Thanks▪ O

And surely i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> makes much for the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mfort of God's poor Children, tho' here they be in Want &amp; Mise∣ry, yet they shall be made Partakers of this Glory of their Head Christ Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Secondly, It serves to astonish all hard hearted Sinners, who contemn Christ &amp; his poor Members: Christ will at last mani∣fest his Power in their just Condemnation such as will not stoop unto him, that he might reign over them by the Scepter of his Word, &amp; hear that still Voice of his in the Ministry o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same shall be never able to abide the bright∣ness of his coming, but shall hear that terrible Voice of his, when he shall exalt himself i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judgment, to the everlasting Confusion of his Enemies.</P>
<P>Seeing the Person of the Judge is of such
<PB N="15" REF="002963_0009_0FE6A8E42AFE7070"/>
endless Power and Glory, of such wonderful Might and Majesty, this must humble all men, when they come to stand in the Presence of so great a Person, as we do when <HI>we</HI> come to hear the Word preached and taught, to receive the holy Sacrament. For when the Word is preached God speaks to us, &amp; <HI>when</HI> we pray we speak to God, and how dare <HI>we</HI> then be so bold to sleep in his Presence, talk, or use any unreverent Gesture? If we were to come into the Presence of an Earthly Prince how careful and circumspect would <HI>we</HI> behave our selves, to do nothing unbeseeming the Pre∣sence of so great a Person? This is the great care of Men, <HI>when</HI> they come into the Presence of an Earthly Judge, to put off their Hats, and to shew all Tokens of Reverence, &amp; it is a won∣der to see how unreverently Men and Women come into the Presence of the ever-living and most high God, into the Presence of the Great Judge of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. When we come to pray, or sing Psalms unto God, how unreverent are some, <HI>would</HI> any man be so in the Sight of an Earthly Judge, or a Mortal Prince? Surely then unre∣verent Behaviour ought to be avoided, ei∣ther when <HI>we</HI> speak unto God by Prayer, or <HI>when</HI> God speaketh unto us in his Word.</P>
<P>And last of all, this may serve for Matter of singular Comfort and Consolation unto all the Godly, that Christ shall appear thus gloriously in Judgment For this assures them that they shall participate of the same Glory with their Head: For this great Judge shall say, <HI>Come ye Blessed:</HI> They shall both with Body and Soul receive a Glorious Kingdom, and a beautiful

Joh 22. <HI>The Father judgeth no Man, but hath com∣mitted all Judgment to the Son.</HI> Not that the first Person in the Trinity, or the Third is excluded from this Judgment, but appropriating his Judgment to the Second Person, the Lord Je∣sus Christ, who in a visible Form, according to his Humanity, shall execute the last Judgment upon all Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI>But how is it said, 1 Cor. 6.2. <HI>That the Saints shall judge the World? Answ.</HI> That place of the Apostle and the like is to be understood as <HI>Assessors,</HI> as such as shall approve of the Judg∣ment of that most righteous Judge, to whom shall be given at the last Day that Honour, to sit as Justices on the Bench by the Judge, to ap∣prove of his righteous Judgment. Again, the Saints shall judge the World, as Members of the Head, which is the Judge.</P>
<P>Now the Administration of the last Judgment is laid upon the Son for divers Respects. 1. <HI>Why Christ will be Judge.</HI> First, In regard that he was the Person that was Redeemer of the World, and was himself judged in and by the World? It is therefore expedient that he should shew the Power and Glory of that in's Humanity, he being Judge of the World.</P>
<P>Secondly, in regard of his Church, who have seen only his Humility to their Justification, so they may at last behold his Power and Glory at his second appearing to their Glorification.</P>
<P>Thirdly, and lastly, That in the last Act of his he might fully accomplish that his Kingly Of∣fice, and then <HI>deliver the Kingdom to God the Fa∣ther:</HI> no more to rule and govern them by his Magistrates and Ministers, as now he doth, for the gathering together of his Saints, and to the

perfecting of God's Body; and to nourish and cherish them by his Word and Sacraments, since<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord himself, the Lamb, in the midst of the Throne, <HI>shall</HI> be all these unto them.</P>
<P>True it is that our Saviour Christ is <HI>King, Priest</HI> and <HI>Prophet,</HI> a true <HI>Prophet,</HI> in whom was contain∣ed all the Secrets, and whole Counsel of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true <HI>High Priest,</HI> whose Sacrifice alone was able to put away the Sins of the whole World, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when he comes on the <HI>Throne of Majesty,</HI> to judge the Quick and Dead, he <HI>will</HI> not come as a <HI>Priest</HI> or <HI>Prophet,</HI> for the Offices of Christ are finished. For this Prophetical Office, he hath sufficiently revealed the whole Counsel of God his Father to his Church and People, first by his holy Pro∣phets, then by himself, after by his Apostles and Ministers. And therefore seeing that this Pro∣phetical Office is finished, he calls not himself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Prophet,</HI> but a <HI>King.</HI> Again, Christ Jesus our <HI>Priest</HI> having once for all offered up that propi∣tiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of all the Elect now this Office of a Priest is also finished, and the Sacrifice must be no more intreated and re∣peated. But now he cometh as a King, in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty and Glory. For tho' his Prophetical &amp; Priestly Office be accomplished, yet his Princely Office is not finished, but shall in a special man∣ner shew it self at that Day, and Christ Jesus the Judge of Quick and Dead, <HI>shall</HI> manifest himself to be King of all Nations, to Men and Angels. Now <HI>shall</HI> he shew himself to be a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, full of Divine &amp; Heavenly Glory.

Face; <HI>Herod, Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas,</HI> and the Rabble of the <HI>Jews</HI> durst then use him at their pleasure. But now he shall come as a King full of Majesty and Glory, guarded and attended upon with many thousand of hea∣venly Soldiers, even all his holy Angels; and then he will make <HI>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</HI> yea, the greatest Kings and Monarchs to stoop; nay, then all his Enemies shall <HI>tremble and quake,</HI> Zach. 12.10.

I am sure</HI> (saith <HI>Iob</HI>) <HI>that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall stand the last day on the earth; and though worms destroy my body, yet I shall see God in my flesh,</HI> Job 19 25. <HI>So</HI> Esay, <HI>the dead shall arise, awake and sing ye that dwell in the earth,</HI> Isa. 26.19. So likewise you may read in the 37 of <HI>Ezek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,</HI> (which I pray you read at leisure) <HI>how the Lord caused the Graves to open, and the Bones to come together, and live:</HI> So that we see that the dead Bodies of God's Children do not perish, they are not cast away and lost when they die, but they shall rise again; they shall be purified, made glorious Bodies, &amp; <HI>shall</HI> stand in Christ's Presence, &amp; see his Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002963_0019_0FE6A9130C867390"/>We must not think the Antiquity of long lying in the Grave, can shelter us from the Re∣surrection, which will be common and general.

for our further Confirmation in this Point of the Resurrection, let us see how it is confirm∣ed to us by Testimonies of holy Scripture, as that of <HI>Daniel, They that sleep in the Dust shall awake, some to everlasting Life, and some to ever∣lasting shame,</HI> Dan. 12 2.</P>
<P>And the Lord God by the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> doth make unto his Church this gracious Pro∣mise, Hos 13.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. <HI>I will redeem thee from the Power of the Grave, I will deliver thee from Death: O Death, I will be thy Death, O Grave, I will be thy Destruction.</HI> This is clear'd by the Tes∣timony of Jesus Christ himself, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.28, 29. <HI>The Hour shall come, in the which all that are in the Graves shall hear his Voice, and they shall come forth</HI>; &amp; <HI>they which have done Good, shall go unto the Resurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil, unto the Resurrection of Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>This is taught by the Apostles of Jesus Christ in divers places of their Epistles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1 Cor. 15.51. <HI>behold I shew you a Mystery, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, and that in the twinkling of an Eye, at the Sound of the last Trumpet:</HI> And so forwards in the same Chapter you may read, which will give you Satisfaction about the Resurrection of the Dead.

<P>Now there are many Grounds for this Truth the main Ground of all this is the Word of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wherein we have a Cloud of Testimonies clean∣ing this Truth.

<P>And indeed the Scriptures are clear and plain for the confirmation of this Article of our Faith, our Resurrection from the Dead, as may appear by all those places here quo∣ted, <HI>Isa</HI> 26 19. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.28.1 <HI>Co.</HI> 15.16 <HI>Acts</HI> 24 15. <HI>Dan</HI> 12 2.</P>
<P>This must needs be a great Comfort to God's Children, when we can say with <HI>Job,</HI> chap. 19.25 <HI>I know what my Redeemer liveth and that I shall see him with these Eyes.</HI> The same Body for Substance, tho' purg'd and clean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Sin, yet the same for Substance <HI>shall</HI> rise again; and these my Eyes which have been careful to seek Christ J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus, to behold his Glory, to read his bless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Word, to relieve the distressed Mem∣bers of Christ, that these my Eyes shall see my blessed Redeemer to my endless Joy; and these mine Eyes, which have been careful to hear thy holy Word, to save my Soul then shall hear his sweet and blessed Voice, saying, Mat. 3.21. <HI>Come be blessed of my Father.</HI> For the Bodies of God's Children shall not perish, but life to Glory, and be made <HI>like unto the glorious Body of Jesus Christ.</HI> O how should this move all Men and Women to use their Bodies well to the Honour of their Creator, seeing he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll not let them pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh, but <HI>will</HI> Crown them and glorify them for ever.</P>

Torment, to be cast into the <HI>Lake of Fire and Brimstone.</HI></P>
<P>Consider the rich Glutton, he should be a Warning to all ungodly Sinners, he gave his Bo∣dy to all Uncleanness and Gluttony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and now is his Body tormented, and he would give even a whole World, if he were Lord over it, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one drop of water to cool his flaming tongue. <HI>O let him be a warning to all Sinners, and teach us to rise our Bodies well, to look to our Eyes, to our Ears, and to set a Watch before our Mouths, for fear left we d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shonour God by them, and bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndless Wo unto our selves.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, you see that it is an exceeding great Joy to the Saints that they shall rise again, and it is a Comfort of all Comforts, that <HI>we shall</HI> rise again, for then these Eyes shall see those Friends, which Sin and Death hath so long se∣parated; so it <HI>will</HI> be a Terror to the Wicked, that they <HI>shall rise again to Judgment.</HI> It <HI>were well</HI> with the adulterous Man, with the Drunkard, &amp;c. if their Bodies might never rise, if they might rot and perish in Corruption, &amp; that their Souls might be even as the Souls of Beasts, a Vapour, utterly to be extinguished, but now there is more behind, they shall one Day come to Judgment. And therefore St. <HI>John</HI> telleth us in this place, <HI>that he saw the Dead, both great and small, stand before God.</HI> Even our dead Bo∣dies must rise, either to Honour or Dishonour, either to Joy or Pain, to Salvation or Damnati∣on, and therefore it is necessary for us, to be∣think our selves of this betimes, while it is called to Day.</P>

<P><HI>Use</HI> 4. Fourthly, this should move us with all Care and Diligence to get good Assurance unto our own Souls, that these Bodies of ours should have a glorious Resurrection in that Day. So <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 24 13 <HI>I have hope towards God, that these shall be a Resurrection of the Dead, both of the just and of the unjust.</HI> And this made him endeavour to keep a good Conscience before God and all Men; so should we live as Men wholly devoted unto God, whose we are in Life and Death▪</P>
<P><HI>Both great and small.</HI> These Words may ad∣mit a double Exposition, for it may seem thus, that by great and small is meant those that by Men grown, or else little Children, Young and Old, all must appear; for we see that many die, even Children of a Span long, some again die full of Years. Well, both great and small must appear, none shall be so young or so little, but they must stand before God, &amp; none so great of so strong, but they must appear likewise.</P>
<P>Secondly, By great and small may be under∣stood all sorts and degrees of Men and Women, rich Men and rich Women, poor Men &amp; poor Women, all Sorts and Conditions shall come to Judgment, as well the Prince as the Subject, as
<PB N="41" REF="002963_0022_0FE6A9145B7E5868"/>
well the Rich as the poor Beggar. As tho' St. <HI>John</HI> should have said, <HI>I saw all men that ever have been, or shall be to the end of the World, none shall be wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing: The rich and poor, young and old, high and low, married, and unmarried, bond and free, all must stand before God.</HI> Oh what a wonderful Assembly <HI>will</HI> this be, to see so many Millions of Thousands?

<P>None <HI>shall</HI> be wanting, the rich and needy, Young and Old, High and Low, Bond &amp; Free, all must stand before God. And therefore it is <HI>well called</HI> the Day of the Lord, when <HI>all</HI> the Off∣spring of <HI>Adam shall</HI> stand before God, whose Na∣ture is Majesty, whose Life is Sanctity, whose Ways are Holy, whose Eternity hath no End, who made the World, and <HI>will</HI> never change his Power nor Mind, whose Age never decays nor, grows old in years. And as St. <HI>Austin</HI> saith when he thought of God's Attributes, <HI>O Eterni∣ty, O Eternity, O Eternity, in repeating the word so often, he thought to have dwelt upon the word</HI>; for indeed Eternity hath no end, &amp; all things else have an end, and all must appear before this e∣verlasting God at this General Assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>So that the instruction is very plain, that all must appear in Judgment: High and Low, Rich and Needy, Noble and Ignoble, all must then make appearance before the Lord Jesus in Judg∣ment; The poorest Soul that ever breathed in the World shall not be wanted, when Christ <HI>shall</HI> come to Judgment, 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>We must all ap∣pear

<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Seeing St. <HI>John</HI> saw the dead, both great and small stand before God, that is <HI>all</HI> sorts of men and women, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, <HI>all</HI> must appear and hold up their hands at the Bar of this great Judge, surely this ought to move all sorts of men, to make a con∣science of their lives, to repent of all their evil ways, to turn to God by true repentance: For no excuse <HI>will</HI> serve your turn, no avoiding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his appearance, <HI>all</HI> must appear, the very devil themselves, and <HI>all</HI> the damned spirits must come to Judgment, <HI>Tophet is prepared for the King</HI> saith <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Isa. 30.33.

And for the place where it shall be, it is imagined by di∣vers good Divines, and likewise by <HI>Thomas A∣quinas,</HI> and all the School-men, except <HI>Peter L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbard,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Hales,</HI> that it shall be over the valley of <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> by <HI>Mount Olivet,</HI> which is near unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> eastward from the Temple, and as our Cosmographers describe i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be in the midst of the superficies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth; and it is very likely for four reasons.</P>
<P>First, To confirm this, the Scriptures doth intimate so much in plain words, <HI>I will gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> together all Nations into the valley of</HI> Jehoshaphat <HI>and plead with them there,</HI> Joel 3.1, 2. <HI>Cause thy mighty one to come down, O Lord, let the Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be awaked, and come up to the valley of</HI> Jehos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣phat, <HI>for there will I sit and judge all the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣then round about,</HI> Joel 3.11, 12.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because that as our Saviour w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thereabouts crucified and put to open sham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so over this place his glorious Throne sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be erected in the Air, when he shall app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Judgment, to manifest his power &amp; g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory for it is meet that Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould in that pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> judge the World with righteous Judgment where he himself was unjustly judged a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> condemned: Likewise that near unto this v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ley was mount <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea,</HI> where <HI>Abraham</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have Sacrificed his Son <HI>Isaac,</HI> as you may read <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. Also that <HI>Jacob</HI> law two Angels sending and descending on a Ladder, <HI>Gen.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="002963_0025_0FE6A922D715FD08"/>
Also the Angel put up his Sword, &amp; fire from Heaven burnt the Sacrifice in <HI>Araunch</HI>'s floor, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2 4 Also near this place <HI>Solomon</HI> built the Temple, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 3.1. Likewise this was near the place where he preached the Gospel, suffered his Passion, and after entred into Glory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because seeing the Angels <HI>shall</HI> be sent to gather together all the Elect from the four winds, from the one end of the Heavens to the other; it is most probable that the place whi∣ther they <HI>shall</HI> be gathered, is to be near to <HI>Je∣rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lem,</HI> in the valley of <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI>; and this valley was so called at first, from the great vic∣tory which the Lord gave <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> and his people over the <HI>Amor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, Moabites,</HI> and those of <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> which victory is a type of the final victory which the Supream Judge shall give his Elect over all their Enemies in that place at the last day.</P>
<P>Fourthly and lastly, Because the Angels told the Disciples, that as they saw Christ ascend from <HI>Mount Olivet,</HI> which is over the valley of <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> so he shall in like manner come down from Heaven; and this is the opinion as I have said before, of the afore-mentioned School-men and Authors.</P>
<P>Now follows in the third place, the most es∣pecial and principal manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all; namely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after what manner all Men <HI>shall</HI> be judged in these words, <HI>And the Books shall be opened,</HI> &amp;c. We know that earthly Judges are brought to the Assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s with great attendance, They being placed, the Prisoners are brought forth, they at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled over one by one, and their Indictment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are read, and Witnesses produced, and so accor∣ding to their offences they receive judgment:
<PB N="48" REF="002963_0026_0FE6A922F755D520"/>
Even so is the great day of the Lord. Christ Jesus <HI>shall</HI> come with ten thousand of Angels, and before him <HI>shall</HI> stand all Men and Women, both great and small, then shall the Books be brought forth. Indeed we see, when an ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thly Judge sits on the Bench, it holds a long time to try Causes: Such witnesses &amp; such evidences <HI>shall</HI> be produced: But it shall not be so at the last day: For when all Men stand at the Bar of Christ's Judgment, they shall be judged accord∣ing to the written Record, even according to the Books; for they <HI>shall</HI> then be opened.</P>
<P><HI>Books, what is meant by them, every Mans Consci∣ence.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if you would know what these Books be; it is easie to know, for they be even the particular Conscience of every Man and Wo∣man: Thy Conscience is the Book that shall be opened, and that <HI>shall</HI> be as good as ten thousand witnesses, either to excuse or accuse thee before God: For there <HI>shall</HI> need no more witness; no other evidence against us at the last day, but our own Conscience: For as God hath his Book of infinite knowledge, whereby he knoweth the sins and offences of all Men, as certainly as if they were written in a Book; So likewise he hath given unto every Man and Woman a Book, their own Conscience, wherein are fully written all our thoughts, words and deeds, so as none shall escape: <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Thou, O Lord, knowest the thoughts of my heart, long before I utter them</HI> And then shall be opened, first, <HI>The Book of the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and then <HI>the Book of the Conscience,</HI> by w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich all our Actions must be try'd and ex∣amin'd, for God keeps a Book of all our par∣ticular

Thoughts, though they were never so swift, and it is call'd God's Book of Remem∣brance; then the Book of our own Consci∣ence <HI>shall</HI> be open'd, which is now so closed up in our Breasts, that no Eye on Earth bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our own knows and perceives; these Books being opened, we shall find then our Sins do agree in every Tittle. Then there is a Book of Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gment which this Sentence <HI>shall</HI> be pro∣nounced by: Then last of all there is a Book of Life, in which all our Names are written, and that was the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok which <HI>Moses's</HI> zeal did desire that his Name m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght be blotted out, rather than his Master's Name should be blas∣phemed.

Mark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pray you, before the Sentence is denounced, the Books shall be opened, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, the Book of the Law, and then the Book of our Consci∣ences; the one shewing a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n what he <HI>should</HI> do the other what he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h done.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Doct. 1.</HI> All our thoughts, words and works must come to Judgment.</HEAD>
<P>Now seeing here wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is meant by these Books, namely every Man's particular Consci∣ence: Let us come to search what are the things written in this Book; &amp; first what use we are to make unto our selves from this:
<PB N="50" REF="002963_0027_0FE6A92BE8AE7D60"/>
<HI>Every Man's Book shall be opened,</HI> &amp;c. First, in these Books are written the very tho'ts of our hearts; none so secret, or so close, but it is here recor∣ded. Secondly, every ungodly speech, every i∣dle word of our mouth. Thirdly every Act that men do, tho' never so closely done.</P>
<P><HI>Thou hast sealed up all our sins in a bag,</HI> saith <HI>Joh,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o shew the exact kind of keeping them against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat day of account. Surely if there be any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing in a man to be marvelled at; I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st needs confess that this is a wonderful work of God, that he hath given to every man and woman a Conscience which is like unto a Book, in which are recorded all our thoughts, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds &amp; works. A wicked man &amp; so unchast woman, how many vile &amp; filthy thoughts have they in their minds night and day? their hearts burn in lust and uncleanness; now they pass away from them they regard them not, they make little or no account of them: But know, they are all writ∣ten in this Book of thy Conscience, thy Consci∣ence marketh them, thy Conscience writeth them down, and if thou wilt not repent of them, and leave them, O wo unto thy Soul, <HI>When these Books come to be opened, and read o∣ver.</HI> For then thy Conscience will accuse thee, and lay unto thy charge every one of them in order.</P>
<P><HI>Thou hast set my misdeeds before me, and my secret sins in the light of thy Countenance,</HI> saith <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in the heart of man what anger, <HI>what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> envy, <HI>what</HI> malice lurks therein, and they pass it over, and think it no matter? Well, know beloved, that un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess you repent of the very thoughts of your hearts, even these things will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found written in the Books at the day of
<PB N="51" REF="002963_0027_0FE6A92BE8AE7D60"/>
Judgment, and what a lamentable thing will that be.</P>
<P>Secondly, As our Consciences is privy unto all our thoughts, and will accuse us of them at the day of Judgment: So all our speeches are noted within. What a number of prophane speeches pass out of the mouth of wicked and ungodly men and women? What horrible and blaspemous Oaths? What cursed speaking ly∣ing and slandring? Now a wicked Person that thus abuseth his tongue so many several times in one day, he cannot for his life remember them. Well, know, that every sinful word thou speak∣est, <HI>is written in this Book,</HI> there it is recorded; and when this Book of thy Conscience shall be opened, it will discover all thy Sins, not only thy filthy Thoughts, but every wicked Word.</P>
<P>Our Saviour tells us, Mat. 12 35. <HI>That we must give an account of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lle word at the day of Judg∣ment</HI>: And tho' Men labour to forget them, &amp; slight them by Pastimes and Company, yet they are written in their Consciences, and one day must come to Judgment. Know this I intreat you, that we must all have a Resurrection, and then give an Account of all our Actions, whe∣ther they have been good or bad; the number is here set down in the word, <HI>all,</HI> as in 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>All must appear,</HI> all must arise and give an Ac∣count to this Judge. Nor must we imagine that we shall be called one by one, like a Jury impa∣nell'd, or like a Company, or Corporation, as first one, and then another, no, it is said all must arise together, and give an Account how we have bestow'd our Talents.</P>
<P>If so, how then should this awaken us ail, and cause us to look unto our Lives, and to learn to
<PB N="52" REF="002963_0028_0FE6A92C0540FC68"/>
know of what we are made, and to make a Co∣venant with our Eyes, at <HI>Job</HI> did; and to con∣fess with him, 'tho' we be now rich and strong, as <HI>Job</HI> was, <HI>that Corruption is our Father, and to the Worm thou art our Mother, and our Sister, and to set a Watch before our Mouths,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> did; and to lay aside our vain Oaths and idle Mirth, <HI>which</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>cannot want Iniquity,</HI> seeing, all of them must come to Judgment.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If we view the lives of Men &amp; Wo∣men, why? (alas) they be nothing almost but a continual Practice of Sin, &amp; the Sins of Mens Lives be innumerable, even as the Sand on the Sea-shore. Now tho' Mens Lives abound with so many thousand Sins, yet we see that Man per∣ceives not, nor knows one quarter of his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t may be he knoweth some, but forgetteth the great∣est part of them, but yet they be all written in the <HI>Book of Conscience,</HI> and they <HI>shall</HI> all come to Judgment, when these Books <HI>shall</HI> be made mani∣fest, though never so secret, for thy Conscience doth mark them all, and pen them down against the Day of Account.</P>
<P>There is no Sin so secret, that God will not bring to light, yea, all our sins <HI>shall</HI> be discover∣ed and laid naked before them, <HI>what hath been done in secret sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be published on the House-top, and shall come to light,</HI> Eccl. 12.14.</P>
<P>And there is reason for it. First, <HI>Because i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall make the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner the more asham'd and tor∣mented for his Sin, for the more a Man comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> see the greatness of his Sins, the more 'twill ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Soul and torment his Heart. As a man that is it Debt, the move he thinks of his Debt the more it trou∣bles him; so it is with a Sinner, his Sins are Debt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> set upon God's Score, and registred in his Books.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002963_0028_0FE6A92C0540FC68"/>Secondly, <HI>That the Wicked may not plead not guilty.</HI> God will take away all Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur of Ex∣cuse, <HI>they shall have no Cloak for then S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>; and if it were not so, they would be ready to say, <HI>Lord, when saw we thee an hungry,</HI> &amp;c. The Lord doth as every righteous Judge doth, or ought to do, convict them before he condemns them.</P>
<P><HI>Now seeing what is meant by these</HI> Books of our Conscience, <HI>and likewise what be written in them, even all our Thoughts, Words and Works let us come to see what use we are to make of this Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. Hence, first of all we may observe the endless love and mercy of our God towards us, foretelling every one of us, of the opening of these Books, that our Consciences shall be laid open, these Books unclasped, and that all our Thoughts, Words and Works must come to Judgment: Surely it is to this end &amp; purpose, that we might prevent the danger that is to come, and labour to keep a good Conscience, washed and purged in the Blood of Christ, that it may not lay to our charge any one sin, but assure us that we are in the favour of God.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Secondly, We see here, that it is not e∣nough for a man or woman to abstain from è∣vil words and works, but evil thoughts like∣wise; the very lusts of the heart. <HI>Paul</HI> com∣plains of this, and <HI>Peter</HI> bids <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gus</HI> to <HI>re∣pent and pray, if perhaps the thoughts of his heart might be pardoned.</HI> How ought then every Chri∣stian man &amp; woman to be wary of their words, yea, of their tho'ts, seeing <HI>we</HI> must give account for all; and our own Conscience <HI>which</HI> is <HI>a</HI> ith∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n us, to bear witness against us; and this we pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it to take notice of if the Book of our Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cience be foul, that we do not sink under the

weight of despair; and if we be clear, not to presume of our selves, as <HI>Peter</HI> did; but rather with <HI>David,</HI> desire the Lord, <HI>Not to enter into Judgment with thy Servant, for in thy fight no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> living shall be justified.</HI> But say, <HI>O Lord, I will not dispute the cause with thee, for if I propound my Righteousness, thou wilt cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn mine iniquity:</HI> We may justifie our selves b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore our selves, but not before God; and not by pleasing our selves but displeasing God, for our Books shall be o∣pened, saith the Text, and that is the Touch∣stone to try whether we have done good or ill. St. <HI>Augustine</HI> confesseth, <HI>O</HI> saith he, <HI>I want mercy and as a Fugitive I return and seek for pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, &amp; con∣fess I am not worthy to be called thy Creature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Conscience tells me so, which is a witness that I da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; hourly carry about me.</HI> And, why should we carry this Book within us, some will say? I answer because God will be just in all his ways, and righteous in all his dealings, &amp; because we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> apt to smother the sins we have comitted, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we think we have committed them secretly, &amp; that no man hath seen us, we <HI>will</HI> deny and forget them: therefore hath God placed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Book in our Breast, <HI>which</HI> is our Conscience <HI>which</HI> will either excuse or accuse us at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> day. I doubt not but the Children of God a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> careful over their very thoughts &amp; words: F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a <HI>wicked</HI> carnal man may abstain from so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> grievous Sin, but it is a note of a true Child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, to repent of his evil thoughts, &amp; be caref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over them continually.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Seeing every Man's Conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Book, and every man's sin is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nned d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> therein: We may see the <HI>woful</HI> misery of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those that have desaled Consciences, wicked a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

unclean hearts. For look how their Conscien∣ces do accuse them, even so will God condemn them. And having not repented of their sins, they carry a torment with them; <HI>namely, a guil∣ty and accusing conscience, which is their Iudge to condemn them, and their Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to torment them</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Here is condemned that <HI>wilfulness</HI> of many in our days, <HI>who</HI> never think of this; but if they can conceal their sins from the World, they think they have done wisely.

<P><PB N="56" REF="002963_0030_0FE6A92EE87957E8"/>Firstly, Seeing the Book must be opened, and every Man's Conscience must come to scanning, because Sentence shall pass, and Judgment <HI>shall</HI> be awarded according to the things written therein: How should this cause us <HI>all,</HI> both Minister and People, to labour to get a good Conscience?

<PB N="57" REF="002963_0030_0FE6A92EE87957E8"/>
Men. But that we may have a good Cons∣cience, we must,</P>
<P>First, Repent of all our sins; we must know by the Law of God▪ what is sin, &amp; what is not.</P>
<P>Secondly We must know the heavy curse of God even for sin, that the reward of sin <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> death eternal, both of body and soul, for men do by Nature sooth themselves in their sins, and tho' we hear of God's Judgments a∣gainst sin, (yet whose heart is touched or troubled?) Thus we run on still in sin, and fear nothing; they mean well they say, but live ill, and think all well.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Till we see what sin is, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> see the curse of God due to sin, we <HI>shall</HI> ne∣ver seriously try our Consciences, &amp; see how our sins have wounded them, that so we may repent us of sin.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We must be grieved for our sins, we must acknowledge and confess them, beg∣ging for the pardon of them; <HI>and to hunger and thirst after Christ Jesus.</HI> For there is no∣thing that can purify the Conscience, &amp; quiet the heart, but only the blood of Jesus Christ applied to our Souls by Faith, with perswa∣sion of the forgiveness of them.</P>
<P>Mark then here (beloved) when a man is thus truly humbled for his sins, and beggeth the pardon of them with sighs and groans, then will the Lord send down into his Soul <HI>his blessed Spirit, to assure us of God's mercy, of the pardon of our sins, that our wounds in Consci∣ence are healed: And this is done by the means of a lively Faith, which purifies the Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>Hereby we may perceive that most men &amp;c. women are in a woful case; for (alas) the
<PB N="58" REF="002963_0031_0FE6A938C19117B0"/>
greatest part are ignorant of the Law of God, and know not what sin is, and what is not sin, and therefore cannot possibly have a clear Conscience; <HI>for Whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</HI></P>
<P>Again, tho' men see their sins, and often∣times their Consciences check them for sin, yet how few do bewail their sins? For I am perswaded, that there is not so wicked a sin∣ner living, but sometimes his Conscience checks him: Indeed Men see not the danger, and feel not he wounds of the Conscience, be∣cause now their Books be clasped, they be shut up, their feared Consciences be now a∣sleep; but the day will come that their Books must be opened, and their secrets declared, &amp; than their Consciences will accuse, condemn and torment them so, that they will wish they had never been born.</P>
<P>Again, When a Man or Woman hath got a good Conscience, so as being truly humbled for their sins, and begging pardon, they find some assurance of God's love in Christ, and that now their Consciences do not accuse 'em; even then must men take no less pains to keep and preserve a good Conscience, to do nothing to wound their Conscience, <HI>O Lord,</HI> saith <HI>David, a wounded Conscience who can bear?</HI> A man's Conscience is a very tender thing, it is li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Apple of thine Eye, if it be prickt but with a pin, it will not only blemish the Eye, but endanger the sight; so the Conscience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a tender thing if ye prick it by sin, it will blemish thy Conscience, wound it, and make havock of thy Soul.

<HEAD>Meant to preserve a good Conscience.</HEAD>
<P>Now that we may keep these Books of Ac∣count (our Conscience) pure and good, we must do two things. First, avoid all things that may any way hurt a good Conscience. Se∣condly, Use all good means and helps to cherish a good Conscience. In truth all sin hinders a good Conscience. Sin is that which does wound the Soul, maketh Shipwreck of a good Consci∣ence, that is the very overthrow of mens Souls. And therefore if you would keep a clear Con∣science, take heed of sin, which wounds a good Conscience, <HI>and makes it unable to stand before God at the last day.</HI></P>
<P>But there be two special lets &amp; impediments of a good Conscience: First, Ignorance of the Law, and of the Word of God: For when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man knows not what is sin, and what not, how can he take heed left he wound his own Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And therefore we see, let a man come into his House at midnight, he can find nothing amiss and out of order; but let a man come in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> noon, then he can espy the least disorder: Even so poor ignorant Souls, not knowing the Law of God, cannot see any wound in their Consci∣ences, nor nothing amiss in them; but let them once come to the Word of God, and look, in this Glass, then they shall find themselves much out of order, to have wounded Souls and defiled Consciences.</P>
<P>Then the other impediment of a good Con∣science, is worldly lust; namely, the love and exceeding desire of Riches, Honours, Pleasures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he that suffers these desires to rule too much in his Heart, cannot possibly keep a good Conscience.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="002963_0032_0FE6A938D76F6F78"/>And here I would advertise every Christian, First, to do all things that may serve &amp; cheri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h true saving Faith, whereby our Souls may be assured of the love of God in Jesus Christ, for the pardon of our sins. For Faith is the root and foundation of a good Conscience. And without Faith there can be no good Conscience. Now to preserve Faith, we must often hear &amp; read in the Word of God, repent of our sins; acknowledge and confess them, and be humbled for them, and walk in the Path of Faith and Repentance, and in so doing we shall find more and more the Comforts of a good Conscience. And therefore we must take heed that we do nothing to break off the feeling of God's love, for to wound our poor Consciences.</P>
<P>Secondly, We must endeavour in all things to obey God's Will, and to bear a constant pur∣pose not to sin in any thing; for a purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live in sin, and a good Conscience, cannot stand together, so that where a purpose is to live i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin, there is neither Faith nor a good Consci∣ence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We must walk with God by ex∣ample, as <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> did; so to order our lives as if we were always in the pre∣sence of God; and likewise to remember that his eye is an all-seeing eye, though we thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> none doth behold us; yet God sees us, and will punish us; but remember this, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will make us keep a good Conscience; and the want of this maketh men bold to sin, be∣cause they consider not that God sees them and that they have a Conscience within the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

<HEAD>And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What is meant by the Book of Life.</HEAD>
<P>THus when Christ Jesus hath examin'd the Books of Mens Consciences, to view what is therein written, that Judgment may be awarded accordingly, now he sheweth that he will open a second Book, and that is even the Book of Life. And of this Book of Life, we shall see often mention made in the Word of God, both in the Old and New Testament; as that of <HI>Moses,</HI> Exod. 32.31, 32. <HI>O this People have sinned a great sin: Therefore now if thou pardon their sins, thy mercy will appear; but if thou wilt not, I beseech thee rase me out of the Book which thou hast written.</HI> Again, <HI>Psal.</HI> 69.28. <HI>Let them be blotted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Book of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Living, and not be written with the Righteous.</HI> Again, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. <HI>He that over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth shall be cloathed in white Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent, and I will not blot his name out of the Book of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife.</HI> And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holy Ghost speaking of the Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> saith, <HI>There shall in no wise enter into it, any thing that defileth or worketh Abomination, or maketh a lie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life, Rev.</HI> 21.27. Now if you would know what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here meant by the Book of Life, it is the Book in which all the Names of God's Elect, which is in his eternal purpose he hath chosen, are written as it were with Letters of Gold: It is nothing else but the Almighties eternal coun∣sel, purpose and decree, wherein he hath elected and chosen a certain company of Man∣kind, to bestow eternal life upon: For we must not think that God hath any need of a Book, not only for our understanding he speaketh thus: Euen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Captain recordeth the names of his
<PB N="62" REF="002963_0033_0FE6A939F6E09968"/>
Soldiers, to call them one by one; and as in Cities, the names of the chief men are record∣ed: So God hath as it were, enroll'd the names of all his Saints, and engraven them in the Book of Life, with letters of Gold for ever, so that not one of them shall perish. Thus having shewed you what is meant by the Book of Life, let us see <HI>what</HI> we may learn hence.</P>
<P>Doct. 1 <HI>Hence then we learn, that God hath a Book of Life, wherein the names of all the Elect are written, who is able to call over his servants &amp; peo∣ple by their names, even as Records are kept in a City or Corporation, wherein the names of all that are free in the same are written:</HI> So perfectly are all the Elect known to God, who can tell them all o∣ver by their names. Let us hear the reasons for the further confirmation of this Point.</P>
<P>First, He is the true Shepherd of his Sheep; now every good shepherd knoweth his sheep. <HI>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine,</HI> Joh. 10 14.</P>
<P>Secondly, The knowledge of God is so exact and perfect, <HI>That nothing can be hid from him. He searcheth the heart, he trieth the reins, and under∣standath the hearts long before. His Eyes are like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass,</HI> Rev. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.18. as St. <HI>John</HI> saith, to shew that nothing ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be hid from his sight.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>What are the Uses.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. First, Hence we behold the blessed and happy estate of all the <HI>Elect and chosen Children of God</HI>: For all these which are <HI>written in the Book of Life,</HI> are blessed and happy for ever. <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be written in the Book of Life, thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh.</HI> Christ will not blot thy name out of the Book of Life, but acknowledge it to be

in his Book at the latter day, to thy endless joy &amp;c eternal comfort, <HI>whom God loves once, he loves to the end.</HI> But miserable are those that are not written in this Book, for all <HI>shall</HI> be shut out of Heaven, <HI>whose Names are not in the Lambs Book of Life, Rev.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P>But here take heed of the carnal reasoning of <HI>wicked</HI> Men and Women. Many there are <HI>who</HI> reasons thus, <HI>if I be a Child of God, and written in the Book of Life, let me live as I lift, nevertheless I am sure to be saved.</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers say, <HI>If I be a reprobate, &amp; am not written in the Book of Life, I am sure I shall not be saved, although I live never so well:</HI> Take heed, I say with St. <HI>Paul, that evil communicatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do not corrupt good manners</HI>; We know that God hath made us <HI>without</HI> our help, yet he <HI>will</HI> not save us <HI>without</HI> our help, or whether <HI>we will</HI> or no: Such-poor souls, they <HI>know</HI> not <HI>what</HI> they say? For if God hath elected any Man or Wo∣man to eternal Life, he hath ordained that they should <HI>walk</HI> in the <HI>way</HI> leading thereunto, and by their good <HI>works,</HI> which others behold, may glorifie their Father <HI>which</HI> is in Heaven: And it is impossible that they should run on in sin, and live and die therein. And therefore such Reasoners do cast <HI>away</HI> their Souls, &amp; with <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> are their <HI>own</HI> Judges and Execution∣ers, but let men <HI>know,</HI> that as God hath ordained some men to eternal Life, and Written their names in Heaven, so he hath appointed them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay</HI> to <HI>walk</HI> in, to bring them thereto.</P>
<P>Secondly, We are taught here, <HI>that the Lord hath a Book of Life, wherein all the names of the E∣lect are written</HI>; We see hence <HI>what</HI> must be our chiefest joy and comfort; even this, to kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assuredly, that our names are <HI>written</HI> in the <HI>Book
<PB N="64" REF="002963_0034_0FE6A93A169AE168"/>
of Life.</HI> This Christ himself <HI>will</HI> teach us in <HI>that</HI> speech of his to his Disciplis, <HI>who</HI> rejoyced be∣cause the Devils were subdued, and cast out by them; <HI>Nay rather</HI> (saith our Saviour) <HI>Rejoyce that your Names are written in the Book of Life?</HI> But alas, <HI>what</HI> do <HI>we</HI> rejoyce in? To be the Son of a rich man, a Gentleman or Nobleman? To have Gold and Silver, Lands and Livings? This makes Men so Lofty and prodigal, that they forget God and a good Conscience, <HI>which</HI> must stand them in great stead at the End of their Life: <HI>But who is he that rejoyceth in this, that he is the Son of God, and that his Name is written in the Book of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Well, having thus observed from the Word of God, <HI>what</HI> is understood by the Book of Life, namely, the eternal decrees of God's Election: hence ariseth two weighty points to be conside∣red. First, <HI>If it be possible for a Child of God to know whether his Name be written in the Book of Life or no?</HI> Secondly <HI>If it be possible, then by what means we may attain this knowledge, to be assured that our Names be in Heaven, that we are in the number of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that shall be saved.</HI> And these are <HI>two</HI> most necessary points to be known of all good Chris∣tians.</P>
<P>Now concerning the first, <HI>If it be possible for a Child of God to know whether his name is written in the Book of Life or not?</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> holds that no man can certainly know <HI>whether</HI> he be a true Child of God, or no. Nay, they condemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is as a fault, and bold presumption for a man to be certainly persuades of this, that he is a Child of God, Elected in Christ Jesus, and that his name is <HI>written</HI> in the Book of Life. They say, <HI>we are to hope well,</HI> But (alas) shall <HI>we</HI> ven∣ture
<PB N="65" REF="002963_0034_0FE6A93A169AE168"/>
the Salvation of our Souls upon an uncer∣tain hope? No, we must go further, and labour to be assured, and certainly persuaded of this hope that our names are Written in the Book of Life.</P>
<P>And that a true Christian Man or Woman, may assuredly be persuaded, and certainly know that he is a Child of God, it is out of question, if he <HI>will</HI> believe the Holy Ghost; else <HI>why</HI> should St. <HI>Peter exhort us to give diligence to make our cal∣ling and election sure.</HI> And why did our Saviour bid his Disciples, <HI>Rejoyce that their Names were written in the Book of Life,</HI> if they could not <HI>know</HI> it? Again, every Article of our Christian Faith confirms the truth of this Doctrine, <HI>where we</HI> are taught to believe the Catholick Church, &amp; that <HI>we</HI> are the number of Gods People: We believe the pardon of our sins, and that we shall have Life Everlasting.</P>
<P>By this you see <HI>how</HI> little we are beholden to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> who holds that <HI>we</HI> cannot be certainly persuaded of our Salvation, but must only hope well. Did not <HI>Job</HI> know it? <HI>Iob</HI> 19.25. Did not <HI>Paul</HI> before know it? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. Then let no man doubt of this, that the Children of God may, and do <HI>know</HI> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y shall be saved. And therefore let us believe this doctrine, and embrace it? And withal let us abhor the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For <HI>what</HI> comfort can any Christian have, till he knows that he is a Child of God? How can we be at peace with our souls? With <HI>what</HI> comfort can we perform obedience unto God, except w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find this blessed persuasion, that our names are
<PB N="66" REF="002963_0035_0FE6A949088F21B0"/>
in this Book, and that we are the elect, and chosen of God?</P>
<P>Secondly, Now the next question is, <HI>How a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> man or woman may come to this certain knowledge, that his Name is written in this Book, and how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may confidemtly be persuaded that he is a Child of God, or no?</HI> And this is a matter of no small moment; but a thing that concerns our Souls very nearly, and therefore let us be very careful to listen unto it, that we be able to prove our selves, <HI>whether we are in the Faith or no,</HI> whether <HI>we</HI> be the Sons of God or no; and so <HI>whether we</HI> shall be saved or not. Oh it is a matter of end∣less comfort to Gods Children when they know this, <HI>that they are the Children of God, and that eter∣nal life belongs unto them, it will stir them up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God with joy and chearfulness all the days of their Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By what means we may come unto this knowledge:</HI></P>
<P>Now there are two ways to know it: One is by ascending up to heaven into the Privy Coun∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of God, but this is a <HI>dangerous way,</HI> and not to be attempted <HI>by any man,</HI> because <HI>secret things belong to the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed, belongs to us and our Children: And his ways are past finding out,</HI> Deut. 29 29. And there∣fore this way no man dares assay.</P>
<P>Besides this, there is yet another <HI>way</HI> to <HI>know</HI> this, and that is by descending and looking in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our selves, and by certain marks and testimonie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in our own hearts to prove that we are of the number of God's Elect. For as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> water sheweth face to face; even so the heart soe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> man to man,</HI> Prov 23. Even as a glass sheweth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mans face, so <HI>will</HI> a mans heart and conscience shew <HI>what</HI> he is in the sight of God. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="002963_0035_0FE6A949088F21B0"/>
you <HI>would</HI> know whether your names are <HI>written</HI> in the Book of Life, that is, <HI>whether you be the Elect of God, and heirs of Eternal Life,</HI> you must enter into your own Souls. <HI>Prove your selves,</HI> and you shall certainly know <HI>whether</HI> you shall be saved, yes, or no. For if thou find in thee the true marks and notes of Gods Children, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedest not fear but that thy name is in this Book and thou shalt certainly be saved: But as for Wicked and Prophane Men &amp; Women, that make no Conscience of sinning, they shall upon this examination, utter this doleful rune; <HI>I am a sinful wretch,</HI> I know not what <HI>will</HI> become of my poor soul at the day of Judgment. And therefore that we may in some measure <HI>try our selves,</HI> and judge <HI>whether</HI> we are in this Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d so shall be saved, let us search out of the Holy Scripture some certain marks of God's Chil∣dren.</P>

Where St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that Wicked and Ungodly Sinners <HI>which</HI> have not the Spirit of God to guide them, but live in sin, have only the Spirit of Bondage, they have no true peace in their Souls: But they that are the Children of God, have the Spirit of Adopti∣on, which se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s unto our hearts the assurance of Adoption and Election, and makes it known un∣to us, that <HI>we</HI> are the Sons of Almighty: <HI>For the Spirit it self doth witness to our Spirits that we are the Sons of God,</HI> Rom 8.16 And that no man may deceive himself, and think he hath
<PB N="68" REF="002963_0036_0FE6A9491FEAE218"/>
the testimony of the Lords Spirit, when he hath it not; St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives two most excellent Notes, to know whether we have the testimony of the Lords Spirit, yea or not; it makes us cry, <HI>Abba Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Where the Spirit of the Lord doth wit∣ness to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny mans Soul, that he is a <HI>Child of God,</HI> it will make him cry unto God, and even fill Heaven and Earth with crying and tears, with sob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sighs, for the pardon of his sins, as <HI>Da∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> did, who in the sincerity of his heart, hum∣bly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed his sins unto the Lord, and left it unto poste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, to be said &amp; sung in the Church, for a testimony of his unfeigned repentance; and he which hath not this in him, that he can∣not cry unto the Lord for the pardon of his sins, this man cannot assure himself that he is a Child of God; and though men say they hope to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved yet (alas) they seldom or never pray unto God for the pardon of their sins, and if they are troubled for them, carelesly pass 'em over with idle company and pastime; just like a man that hath burnt his finger, puts it into cold water, which for a time ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ages it; but pulling it out again, it inflames and burns the worse. Secondly, if we find by the Testimony of Gods Holy Spirit, that we are the Children of God, it will make us not only to be earnest with God for the pardon of our sins, but will make us cry, <HI>abba father,</HI> that is, it will make us bear the <HI>tender affection of a dutiful and obedient Child,</HI> so as we shall be afraid to offend so loving a <HI>Father,</HI> not so much for fear of punishment due for sin, as for offending so loving a God, who hath loved us from the beginning. And therfore all those which delight in sin, and are not afraid to offend God, surely they can find no
<PB N="69" REF="002963_0036_0FE6A9491FEAE218"/>
<HI>assurance</HI> that they are the Children of God. And therefore if you desire to be assured that your Names are in this Book, labour to find this Testimony <HI>of Gods Spirit, to witness to your souls, that you belong to God,</HI> and labour to be earnest in prayer to God, for that is a <HI>special Work of Gods Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The second means whereby we may kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that our names are Written in the Book o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Life, is by the Word of God: For the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God tells us, <HI>whosoever believeth in Iesus Christ shall be saved.</HI> But a Child of God hear∣ing this promise opened and applyed by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministry of Gods Word and Spirit, is able t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, <HI>I believe, and am able to apply this promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to my self</HI> For a man that hath faith, know∣eth that he hath it: And therefore can say, <HI>seeing I believe with all my heart, I surely know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be saved.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Besides the blessed Testimony of Gods spi∣rit,</HI> which cannot deceive, and the Witness of the Word of Truth, we may know our <HI>Election,</HI> by the fruits and effects thereof. As we say, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man is alive so long as he breaths, and can judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Tree by its Fruits:</HI> Even so by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Election, <HI>we</HI> may <HI>know whether</HI> our N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Book of Life, or not. Now the Fruits of election are set down by the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Spirit, that all men may be able to examine and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y themselves, and know whether they be ordain∣ed to life, or not, Rom 8 30. <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> God pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣nated, them he also called; and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ked, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be also justified; and whom he justified, them be also Glorified.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>we</HI> may behold the marks of our E∣lection; for all that be <HI>Elected</HI> unto Life Eter∣nal
<PB N="70" REF="002963_0037_0FE6A94A55A01E18"/>
and are <HI>written</HI> in this Book, they are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st <HI>called,</HI> secondly, <HI>justified,</HI> and thirdly, <HI>sanctified</HI> So then, if you <HI>would know</HI> whether you are E∣lected to life, look to those three effects of <HI>Elec∣tion,</HI> Art thou <HI>called?</HI> Art thou <HI>justified</HI>? Art thou <HI>sanctified?</HI> Then sure thou art <HI>elected</HI>; but if thou hast not these three, then thou canst no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assure thy self of thy Salvation.</P>
<P>So then the first fruit of our Election is our <HI>Effectual Calling:</HI> When God doth by his Spirit, and the preaching of the Gospel, call us out of the World from our old sins, to be of the number of his People, to live as his Children: As he call'd <HI>Samuel</HI> three times, so <HI>Samuel</HI> answered and left his bed: And like∣wise as he did <HI>Paul,</HI> when he went to perse∣cute the Children of God at <HI>Damascus</HI>; and so he did <HI>Matthew</HI> from the receipt of Custom. So he called <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> from fishing, and made them to be fishers of men. At this call being amazed, <HI>Paul</HI> fell to the ground; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was the happiest fall that ever man had, for as one says, <HI>he fell a Jew, and rose a Christian.</HI></P>
<P>Again, when a man cometh by the Spirit or preaching of the Word, to see his sins, and Gods anger for them, <HI>he dislikes them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grieved for them, bewails them, and begs pardon for them,</HI> and begins to become <HI>a new man,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe in Christ, to seek after Gods King∣dom, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did. He which findeth the effectual calling in him, may assure his soul, that he is predestinated to eternal life. But we must take heed that we deceive not our∣selves with an outward calling: For our Sa∣viour saith, <HI>Many are called, but few are chosen.</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="002963_0037_0FE6A94A55A01E18"/>
Many hear the Word of God with the ear, but we must labour to find <HI>the Spirit of God,</HI> to preach unto our souls, to apply the Word of God unto our <HI>Consciences,</HI> to believe in it, &amp; to obey it, this is that which is found in every Christian, and that which assures him of E∣ternal Life and Salvation, and therefore they which live in their old sin, are as blind, ig∣norant and prophane as ever; (alas) how can they think to be saved, seeing God chu∣seth none, or saves not any but whom he calls effectually by the Gospel, and severs from the rest of the World.</P>
<P>Secondly▪ The fruit of Election is Justificati∣on, <HI>For whom he predestinated, them he called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he called, them he justified,</HI> Rom. 8.30. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en is another token and mark to know whether we are Elected, namely, our <HI>Iustificati∣on</HI> Now this is a special grace of God, to jus∣tifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a poor sinner that must be saved; &amp; who∣soever is not justified, cannot be saved. <HI>Justi∣fication</HI> hath two parts, first, the pardon of sin▪ secondly, the imputation of Christ's Righteous∣ness. For before a man can be justified, he must <HI>repent of his sins,</HI> know them, <HI>hate and abhor them,</HI> and beg the pardon of them, &amp; then <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> will assure us of the pardon of them. And therefore if <HI>we</HI> would know whether we be jus∣tified or no, we must look whether we have truly repented; yea, &amp; have been truly hum∣bled for our sins, and got the pardon of them all. Secondly, that we may be truly justified, we must have a true faith in Christ Jesus, to lay hold upon him, and to wrestle with him, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did with the Angel, and not let him go, till he gives us a blessing, to be persua∣ded
<PB N="72" REF="002963_0038_0FE6A94A703994C0"/>
and assured in our souls, that Christ died for us, shed his blood for us, obeyed the law for us, and will cover all our sins and trespasses in his Righteousness, so then, mark the Conclusi∣on; where there is repentance and obedience, there is remission of sins, where there is remissi∣on of sins, there is Justification; and where there is Justification, there is Salvation. And this we must acknowledge not to have by na∣ture, but by <HI>Regeneration,</HI> which is wrought in us by Jesus Christ, being the Author and Fini∣sher of our Faith and Salvation; and we must always confess that all the benefits and means of our Salvation we have received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m him; and it is he that hath separated us wretched sinners from the World, by an out∣ward vocation, and an inward illumination of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which hath already kindled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith in us, through the hearing of his holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: It is by the Grace that we believe in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee our Saviour; and let us beg at Gods hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at our Faith fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l not, but that he make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that we may be justified and glorified on the day of our Lord Jesus. And on the con∣trary, where there is no repentance, nor obedi∣ence, there is no remission of sins; <HI>where</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no remission of sins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is no Justificati∣on; and <HI>where</HI> there is no Justification, there is no Salvation.</P>
<P>On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en what shall become of those that live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in sin, as <HI>Pharoah</HI> &amp; <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> did. And as the rich man, which laid to his Soul, <HI>Soul, take thine eas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hast goods laid up for many years</HI>: These m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> trusted more in the Creature, than in the Creator: More in their Host, Strength &amp; Rich∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, than in the living God▪ These are such
<PB N="73" REF="002963_0038_0FE6A94A703994C0"/>
which delight in sin, and never as yet could shed one tear for their manifold and grievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they cannot find themselves to be justified, they can have no pardon of their sins, so long as they live in sin, and therefore if you would know whether you shall be saved or no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣bour fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of all to repent, and to lay hold on Christ by faith, that he may cover your sins in his Blood.</P>
<P>The third fruit of Election, is <HI>Sanctification</HI> and this is a special mark of God's Child, to be <HI>Regenerate,</HI> to be <HI>Sanctified.</HI> Now Sanctification standeth in two parts. First, they must die to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Secondly, they must rise to righteousness, and labour to know Christ, and the virtue of his Resurrection: And Christ's Resurrection must be our Regeneration, and our Regenera∣tion must be our Resurrection from sin and ini∣quity. And <HI>would</HI> you know assuredly, whe∣ther your names are Written in the Book of Life: Look to your hearts, if you find that you are Sanctified, if you hate your old sins, or former evil ways, if you love Virtue, &amp; delight in holy duties, then it is a certain token th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ye belong to God. <HI>For there is therefore no com∣demnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,</HI> Rom. 8.1. But if you do favour the things that are of the flesh, and desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the garli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d flesh port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> lying in old sins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drunkenness, and the like: Then certainly you have no Assurance of Salvation, but you must repea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this dreadful saying, <HI>I know not what s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lt be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of my poor soul, whether I shall be saved or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Nay, if thou live in sin, thou mayst justly fear that thou art a firebrand in Hell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <HI>He that is born of God, sinner b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 18. <HI>And let every one that nameth the Name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19.</P>
<P>Thus to die to sin, and to live in Righteous∣ness, is a sure token that we belong to God. Thus I have shewed you how a man may <HI>know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hether he is Elected</HI> and ordained to Life, or not. Now let us see what Use ariseth hence.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 1. Seeing God hath this Book of Life, in which is Written the names of all those that shall be saved, and none of them shall pe∣rish. Hence proceeds endless comfort to all Gods Children; if thou find that thou art a Child of God, and thy name is written in Heaven, nothing can hurt thee though thou be poor with <HI>Job,</HI> sick with <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> in Prison with <HI>Joseph,</HI> haled to death with thy Saviour Christ, yet nothing can hurt thee; Nay the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against thee; no damnation can come to thee; <HI>For if God justify, who can condemn</HI>? For at the day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgment, Christ Jesus will take his Book of Life, and call us, saying, <HI>Come ye blessed, &amp;c.</HI> So that we shall not come to a terrible Judge, but a loving Saviour.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 2. Secondly, Seeing it is so excellent a thing to have our Names Written in this Book, to be the <HI>Elect Children of God</HI>; we should labour for this above all things in the World, for without this we can have no found Comfort, either in this Life or death. And therefore our blessed Saviour bids us in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not boast our selves of Learning of Wisdom, or of Riches, because they are but
<PB N="75" REF="002963_0039_0FE6A9576AC1FBE0"/>
vain things; but to <HI>rejoyce that our Names are written in Heaven.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>This shews the necessity of Christian Obedience.</HEAD>
<P>Thirdly, Seeing God hath a Book of Life and hath written down the very names of every man and woman that shall be saved, and hath withal shewed us the way that leads to Life, and unless we walk in this way, we cannot come unto it; it is our wisest course for to walk in the way, that leads to Life, in the practice of Godliness. We are <HI>Vessels of Honour,</HI> and there∣fore must live <HI>Soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World</HI> Not serve Sin and Satan any lon∣ger, but labour to die to sin, before we die so nature, &amp; bury sin, before it buries us; for the issues of sin brings nothing but vexation and shame in this Life, and perdition in the Life to come. Oh let us then as the redeemed of the Lord, walk from strength to strength, from ver∣tue to vertue, from one degree of perfection to another, till at length we appear perfect Men and Women before the Lord, and there reap the happy reward, even the fruition of all good∣ness, and that for evermore.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>COncerning the Book of Life, you have heard already, what is meant by it; namely, the Counsel and decree of God's Election, <HI>where∣by</HI> he hath chosen Men and Women out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ump of Mankind, upon whom he will bestow eternal Life.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have learned that a Man may, nay, every Christian Man and Woman ought to be assured that his <HI>Name is written in it.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, We set down some marks out of the Scriptures, whereby a Christian may be assured he is Elected; namely,</P>
<P>First, the Testimony of God's Spirit, which cannot lie.</P>

And without it we can have no <HI>true Joy</HI> to our Souls. Surely mens carelesness in this point is great. They are careful to make their Lands and Leases sure, which condemns them for their want of care in this point.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>After what manner all men shall be Judged.</HEAD>
<P>Now St. <HI>John</HI> proceedeth in the description of this last <HI>Judgment,</HI> as it was declared unto him in a <HI>Vision</HI>; in an <HI>Island.</HI> It was necessary to have it there, it being private and free from Compa∣ny, his Soul might the better be fitted with con∣templation to receive the power of God: For when humane help is farthest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, then God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most near to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children. And then St. <HI>John</HI> sheweth after what manner we shall be judged: <HI>Even according to those things written in the Book, according to our works.</HI> You have heard before, <HI>That he saw all, both great and sin all stand before God.</HI> None shall be wanting; now it may be won∣dred how so great a multitude shall be judged, how every mans Book shall be read, and every mans Conscience tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. For we see what a long time it holds our Judges here, to try a few per∣sons; such calling of Evidences, such produ∣cing of Witnesses, such prefering of Indict∣ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But St. <HI>John</HI> saith, that it shall not be so here, for all must proceed according to the written Records, <HI>And according to those things which are written in the Book.</HI> So that when Christ Jesus the great Judge shall once sit upon the Throne of his Glory, attended by his holy Angels, then
<PB N="78" REF="002963_0041_0FE6A958B563C538"/>
shall the Book of every man's Conscience be o∣pened and then they shall afresh call to mind their former sins which they have committed so freely and willingly, running into sin, <HI>without</HI> remorse or fear.</P>
<P>In these words we are to observe three speci∣al points.</P>
<P>First, Who they are that must come to Judg∣ment, namely, the <HI>Dead.</HI> They which have lain many thousand years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otting in the Grave; and then likewise let us observe that God <HI>would</HI> have us certain of the day of Judgment.</P>
<P>First, <HI>For his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>For our Comfort</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>For to keep us in fear of him.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That all might be inexcusable.</HI></P>
<P>First, God would have us certain of the Time.</P>
<P>First, <HI>To exercise faith and patience.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>To bridle our Curiosity.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>To contain us in our duty</HI>; therefore (saith the Apostle,) <HI>Be ye always ready; for in such an hour as ye think not of, the Son of Man co∣meth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The means whereby they must be tryed; even by those things which are written and Recorded in their Books which is their Consciences.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Touch-stone of this Tryal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> namely, the Word of God, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the Persons.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that St. <HI>John</HI> meaneth that <HI>all</HI> must come to Judgment; <HI>Both great and small must stand before God.</HI> But why doth he say here, <HI>And the dead shall be judged!</HI> It is to be observed, that he names expresly the
<PB N="79" REF="002963_0041_0FE6A958B563C538"/>
dead, even those that have lain rotten many thousand years, must come to Judgment they must be called to account, their old sins must now be brought to light; for these are the Wicked Thoughts of many carnal men, that when a man is dead, he is well! Then all his sins die with him, he is forgotten, and his sins are not spoken of. But St. <HI>John</HI> saith here, <HI>that even the dead must come to Iudgment, even their old sins must come to light, and they must answer for 'em.</HI> It is perhaps Six Thousand Years since <HI>Cain</HI> flew his Brother, yet his sin shall not be for∣gotten; tho' <HI>Cain</HI> be dead long since, yet his sins are not dead; No, no, <HI>Cain</HI> shall one day come to account for his sin. <HI>Iudas</HI> who betray∣ed his Master many hundred years ago, at this day shall be called to account.</P>
<P>So in these our days many men think when they die, their sins shall never be bro't to light</P>
<P>The Userer that by wicked means getteth Wealth: When he dies perhaps he thinks he shall never hear of his sins again. So the Drun∣kard, Swearer, Prophaner of the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they think that death will end their Misery, &amp; that they shall never come to Judgment, but they are deceived; and to prove the same Christ said to his Disciples, <HI>be of good cheat, though the World hate and revile you for my sake:</HI> yet he told them, <HI>for those sufferings here on earth, that they should sit upon twelve Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of Israel,</HI> a shadow whereof we have in these our earthly Judgments, where you see the Justices and men of account sit with the Judge, which is a Token of Honour and Dignity in the sight of the People; not that they have to

do with pronouncing Sentence, or with the Judgment; according to which we read, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.28. <HI>That there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</HI> when the ungodly which used no Con∣science while they lived, nor once thought of their giving account, shall see <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI>; meaning thereby all the godly and faithful, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of Heaven; and themselves thrust out, and Heaven Gates shut against them; being in that case <HI>Dives</HI> was, who in Hell beheld <HI>Lazarus</HI> in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bosom, himself crying out for one drop of water to cool that unquenchable heat which he suffered, and could not obtain it. Then shall these wicked worldlings which set their hearts only on their riches, pleasures and pre∣ferments, when they shall behold the righteous stand in great boldness and chearfulness, be grievously terrified with horrible fear and a∣mazement.</P>
<P>And then shall their Consciences accuse 'em, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd their minds change within them, and sign with inward grief and say within themselves. <HI>These are they whom sometimes we had in devision,</HI> these are they whom we wronged in their E∣states, and whom we so much oppressed and scorned; and as indeed who are more derided in the World, than they that are well disposed, and live in the fear of God? <HI>These are they which we had in devision,</HI> and said unto our selves, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fools thought their lives madness, and their ends with∣out Honour: But now how is it that they are count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> amongst the Children of God, and that their portion in among the Saints, and that they are so highly in God favour? Therefore we have erred from the way of Truth and the light of Righteousness hath not shined unto u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="81" REF="002963_0042_0FE6A958D32AE410"/>
And the Son of understanding rose not upon us: We have wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: And we have gone thro' dangerous ways, but we have not known the way of the Lord, nor lived in his fear, nor have we diligently walked with upright Consciences before God and Man.</HI> Ah (poor Souls) it were well with them indeed if death might end their woful misery: But alas, alas, Death is even as a wide Gate, to give them a passage to endless woe and misery. For when they are dead and buried, their sins dye not with them, their misery is not then ended: O no, then, be∣gins their misery and torment. O it were good they might no more have a being after Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it had been good for such men if they had ne∣ver been born; or being born, that they had been rather Toads or Serpents, for in death these have an end; but it is not so with the wicked and ungodly sinner; for when he is dead and buried, even then begins his greatest woe and misery; for the sinner that is dead many thou∣sand years, must for all this come to Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment. And therefore thou that livest in Adultery, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in any other sin whatsoever, Remember that tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> die, yet thy sins die not with thee, No, no, both thou and thy sins must one day come to Judgment. <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ember <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> young man, that for all this thou must come to Iudg∣ment.</HI> Thy old sins, and those which thou hast committed in secret, they must now come to light.</P>
<P>Seeing that the dead must come to Judgment that have lain so many hundred years in the Grave, and that their old and secret sins must come to light; O let us then watch over our lives, and have this still in our minds; well
<PB N="82" REF="002963_0043_0FE6485D2D640E60"/>
tho' I die, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot in the Grave, <HI>yet my sins shall not die, any evil ways cannot be forgotten,</HI> they must come to light, so that we may never dare to sin, thinking as many do, that when they are once dead, they must never come to an account for their sins. But St. <HI>John</HI> saith here, <HI>That the dead were judged,</HI> even those whom we forget, and whose sins we would think would never be called to an account, even they must come to a reckoning: <HI>For God will bring every work to Iudgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> Eccl. 12.14. Which will be terror to the Wicked: But the Saints of God are not afraid of the Tribunal, or Judgment Seat; but in the quiet of a good Conscience they comfort them∣selves in Jesus Christ. God punisheth all our sins in strictness of Right, but hath Mercy in Transferring the Punishment upon Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>In the next place St. <HI>John</HI> tells us, how men shall be tryed, and according to what evidence, Sentence shall be awarded; namely, according to those things written in their Books. Here is the Evidence, here is no witness to be produ∣ced; for a man's Conscience shall be even as a thousand witnesses. Now what is here meant by the Books, you have heard already; namely, the particular Conscience of every man &amp; wo∣man. Saith the <HI>Samaritan</HI> woman, <HI>behold, come and see a man which hath told we all things which I have done.</HI> Just so will our Consciences witness against us; thy Conscience is the Book that is the Evidence: Again, the things that are writ∣ten in the Book, I told you they are all our evil thoughts, words, and works; not only our gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss sins, as Murther, Adultery, Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in our Books is recorded, even our i∣dle
<PB N="83" REF="002963_0043_0FE6485D2D640E60"/>
and vain words, every idle and filthy tho't, our close and secret sins, nay our whispering &amp; covert sins such sins will then be brought to light, which now we have almost forgotten. While we lived, we sowed our words and idle thoughts, as a Husbandman doth his seed, <HI>which</HI> will one day rise up again, which we long ago tho't had been forgotten &amp; intombed. Mans Conscience is Gods Register, as one day will appear plainly and evidently to our sorrow, <HI>we</HI> shall hear again of every light transgression, and idle word that we do but whisper against our neighbour; and by this sentence must proceed, and according to our deserts, must Judgment be awarded.</P>
<P>Now then, those <HI>which</HI> have good and holy thoughts <HI>written</HI> in their Book, they are bles∣sed and happy, for they shall not be ashamed a∣stray, they shall be glad to have their Books laid open, that their <HI>Obedience, Repentance, Faith, Love, Zeal, Patience,</HI> &amp;c. may be known and come to light: But woe then to all filthy Adulterers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the reward of these sins is death, the wrath and curse of God for ever.</P>
<P>But when our cause cometh to be cryed before God, from <HI>whom</HI> nothing is hid, nor can be kept secret, then no excuses can pre∣vail; to so say, <HI>I have married a Wife, and can∣not come, or have bought this Farm, or that yoke of Oxen,</HI> I pray you have me excused from this Tryal. No, this shall not serve the turn, come, thou shalt stand naked before the Judge, then no perswasion can prevail, neither any devices help us, or blind the Judge. Our first Parents, When God called them to a Tryal for transgressing his Commandments, &amp; <HI>when</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="002963_0044_0FE6A96865596E90"/>
they fled from God and hid themselves, but by excuses? <HI>Adam</HI> speaks for himself, &amp;c says, <HI>The woman which thou gavest me, gave me of the Tree, and I did eat.</HI> The Woman likewise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he thinks to escape by that means, <HI>Eve</HI> saith, <HI>the Serpent beguiled me and I did eat.</HI> Likewise when King <HI>Saul</HI> had disobeyed God's Commandment turning after the prey; being called to Ac∣count, he deviseth an excuse, and saith, <HI>Yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have bro't</HI> Agag <HI>the King of</HI> Amalek, <HI>and have destroyed the</HI> Amalekites: <HI>But the people took of the Spoil, Sheep and Oxen, and the chiefest of the things, which have been destroyed, to offer unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst these may <HI>Pilate</HI> be reckon'd, <HI>who</HI> against his own Conscience condemned Christ to Death, and yet would excuse himself as though he were innocent in the cause. <HI>When</HI> Pilate <HI>sam that, he took water and washed his hands,</HI> saying, <HI>I am innocent of the Blood of this just man</HI>; All this shall not serve the turn, their excuses must not free them, for their Consciences tell them otherwise; no fair tale shall then be heard, but the plain and nake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truth, and our own Consciences shall testifie against us; and we shall not be able to an∣swer one word of a thousand; we shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forced to confess our misdeeds, and can keep back nothing, for all must be manifest: And <HI>we</HI> shall not find as it is in this <HI>World,</HI> when upon the humble confession of our sins to God, we may cry for pardon, and hope to be forgiven; but then <HI>shall</HI> our confession be to our open shame, confusion, &amp; endless destruc∣tion: Yea, all the Nations and People of the

World, that ever have been, shall be gather∣ed before the presence of this Judge, &amp; their witness in their Bosoms. And the reason <HI>why</HI> they shall appear, is, that they <HI>shall</HI> be called to an account of their Stewardship; &amp; after Tryal of their Cause, he shall separate the one from the other, the just from the unjust, the godly from the ungodly, the Sheep from the Goats, for saith St. <HI>Matthew, He shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet; and they shall gather together h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect from the four winds, and from one end of heaven to the other.</HI> Where∣by may be perceived, that both the good &amp; the bad <HI>shall</HI> be gathered into the presence of the Judge, and then <HI>shall</HI> just men shine as the Sun, and <HI>shall</HI> be as it were quit by procla∣mation, <HI>Come ye blessed,</HI> which made the Apo∣stle St. <HI>Paul</HI> to break out into these words, <HI>Herein is the love of God perfect towards us, that we should have boldness at the day of Judgment:</HI> Therefore do the godly make their prayers in an acceptable time, and with that this day may come shortly. <HI>Come Lord Jesus, come quick∣ly.</HI> This is a comfort to the righteous man, when his Conscience <HI>shall</HI> be found blameless in this day of Tryal.</P>
<P>Seeing that here is the Evidence, and by the things <HI>written</HI> in the Book, in our Consciences; <HI>we</HI> must be arraigned; and seeing in our Books is recorded <HI>all</HI> that we do, all our words, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and deeds, and that we must give up our left account; what account <HI>shall</HI> those give who have been idle hearers, and idle doers of his Word?</P>
<P>First, It must teach us above all things to look to our Books, our Consciences, to keep
<PB N="86" REF="002963_0045_0FE6A96880DBE110"/>
them very fair and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that our B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks of ac∣count be in a readiness; for our Consciences shall either excuse or accuse us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that day.</P>
<P>Therefore the greatest burthen a man can bear, is the burthen of sin lying upon his Con∣science, and pressing it down w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thout any as∣surance of pardon, and so by consequence <HI>Dav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> accounts that he is blessed, who is eased of the burthen of his sins: Let them that fear the Lord, and love their own Souls, give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dili∣gence to make sure the remission of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Sins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ss of heart, drowsiness of Spirit, and a Conscience which is feared, as with a hot Iron, which causeth the fearful Judgment of God, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the last receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> according to that he hath done in this Life, whether it be good or bad.

By reason we must all come to J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gment, and our Consciences laid open, and we judged according to the things that are therein recorded; this I say made that holy Servant of God, to take all possible pains to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>op a clear Conscience before God and Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we may imitate this blessed Apostle, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coing we must all come to Judgment, our Books, even our Consciences, must be opened and disclosed, that we must receivve sentence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Salvation or Damantion, accord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> written in our Books: O that we would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and endeavour, that no filchy sins might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Books, but that we may keep them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of God.

look to this, to keep the Book of our Conscien∣ces fair: <HI>For if ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and will also condemn us,</HI> 1 John 3.20.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Secondly, Seeing that sentence must pass according to the things written in our Books, and those are not only the gross sins of the World themselves, but even the vile &amp; un∣clean thoughts of our hearts, even these must come to Judgment; then let us be careful to avoid not only the outward actions themselves, but those unclean thoughts of ours; for they must come to Judgment. Alas, many think th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughts are free, &amp; they <HI>shall</HI> never be arraign∣ed for their vile and ungodly thoughts: But St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Thoughts shall either excuse or accuse us, Rom</HI> 1 20. And whosoever truly repents, they repent of their vile and ungodly thoughts; for if we had sins written in the Book of our Con∣sciences, but our sinful thoughts, they were e∣nough to condemn us, both Body and Soul, for evermore.</P>
<P>Neither let us content our selves to think, <HI>we</HI> are in a good case, if <HI>we</HI> can say, like the proud Pharisee, (which justified himself before God &amp; Man) <HI>I am no Drunkard, nor Formcator, nor Ex∣tortioner,</HI> &amp;c. No, let us look to our own Book, that there be not so much as an idle word written there, that hath not been blotted out with the tears of true Repentance, for even they must come to Judgment, as our Saviour saith, <HI>for I say unto you, that every idle word that Men shall speak, they foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give account thereof in the day of Judgment,</HI> Mat. 14.36.</P>
<P>And that we may know in particular, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Written in our Books, St. <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="88" REF="002963_0046_0FE6A9718DEE8358"/>
shall be judged according to our works,</HI> Rev. 20.13. So it is, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 5.10. <HI>We must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> We shall be judged, and receive a reward according to our works. If thy works are good, then life, glory and salvation; but if they works be evil, then death, destruction and damnation. Good <HI>works,</HI> although they cannot merit yet they <HI>will</HI> shew the Faith <HI>which</HI> lay in the heart. So <HI>when</HI> an evil man dies, as <HI>Dives,</HI> his evil works go with him, his guilty Conscience <HI>will</HI> not leave him, neither in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife nor death. Wherefore this day of Judgment may well be called the day of Revelation, when all that is now hid, <HI>shall</HI> be revealed and made <HI>known.</HI> Here on earth ma∣ny things are kept close and hid? But God <HI>shall</HI> lighten all things that are hid in darkness, and make the Counsels of the heart manifest, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. And at that day <HI>God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.</HI> Rom 2.16</P>
<P>Doct. 1. <HI>Men shall be judged according to their works.</HI></P>
<P>Hence then we see, that all Men and Women shall be tryed at this dreadful day, by their works: Either they sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l be acquitted &amp; absol∣ved, or else condemned by their works: For tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no man can merit Life and Salvation, at the hands of God by his works, yet kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w this that Judgment shall proceed at the last day, ac∣cording to thy works. If thy works have been good, just, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pure; then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shalt re∣ceive life, happiness, glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and salvation: but if thy works are wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked, unjust, and ungodly, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n nothing but Death, Hell, and Damnation
<PB N="89" REF="002963_0046_0FE6A9718DEE8358"/>
belongs unto thee. God told <HI>Adam, In the day that thou eatest of the Tree of Life, thou shalt surely, die the Death.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour teacheth us, that a cup of cold water should not go unrewarded with him at the last: And of <HI>Cornelius</HI> it is said, <HI>that his pray∣ers and aims are come up for a memorial before God.</HI> And to this agreeth, the Author to the <HI>Hebrews, God is not unrighteous to forget your works and la∣bour of love,</HI> &amp;c. And as the Godly <HI>shall</HI> be re∣warded according to their works: So likewise in regard of the Wicked. <HI>These things hast thou done,</HI> &amp;c. And again, <HI>I was hungry, and ye fed me not,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. Well, what should this teach us, seeing <HI>we</HI> must <HI>all</HI> receive sentence, according to our Works? Surely it ought to move us <HI>above all</HI> things in the World, to labour to a∣bound in <HI>all</HI> holy Duties and Graces of God's Spirit, in Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Love, Zeal, Cloathing, Feeding, &amp; Lodging the poor Members of Christ; for according to our <HI>works,</HI> so <HI>shall</HI> our reward be: And though our Works can merit nothing at the hands of the Judge, yet he being a most bountiful and merciful Saviour, <HI>will</HI> crown his own Works in us, and reward them in his mercy, though <HI>we</HI> merit nothing. Dost thou relieve a poor Member of Jesus Christ? or dost thou give a Cup of cold Water to a Pro∣phet. Christ doth promise thee of a truth, he <HI>will</HI> not let thee lose thy reward. True it is, a Cup of cold Water is a mean Gift, and far from any merit; yet Christ saith. <HI>Verily, verily, of a truth thou shalt not lose thy reward.</HI></P>
<P>Oh how should this persuade <HI>all</HI> to labour to abound in <HI>all</HI> holy duties, to be liberal &amp; boun∣tiful
<PB N="90" REF="002963_0047_0FE6A971A7B6ABF8"/>
to the poor afflicted members of Christ, see∣ing our good Works, <HI>tho' they cannot merit, yet they shall be rewarded; they shall not be forgotten in the day of Judgment</HI>? They are sweet &amp; bles∣sed Companions? When <HI>all</HI> our friends can do us no good, they <HI>will</HI> bring endless peace and comfort to our souls.</P>
<P>Again, It ought to terrifie us <HI>all</HI> from evil <HI>works,</HI> &amp; ungodly ways? From Whoring, Drun∣kenness, Uncleanness, and every evil way; for if we are full of these, and these be found <HI>writ∣ten</HI> in our Books? O then! Wo unto us when these Books <HI>shall</HI> come to be opened, for then nothing but Death, Hell &amp; Damnation belongs unto us. The remembrance of this latter day teacheth us,</P>
<P>First, The fear of God not to sin.</P>
<P>Secondly, Faith in Christ to receive eternal Life.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Patience in Adversity, because after momentary pain, succeeds everlasting Joy.</P>
<P>Doct. 2. <HI>Here we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of all that we have and enjoy in this world what shall go with us when we dye, what shall accompany us to the Grave, and to Judgment; our Conscienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and our Works, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing else-shall go with us.</HI> And when thou diest, thou shalt not take any thing in the World with thee, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they works, <HI>which is engraven in the Book of thy Conscience.</HI> Thou canst not take thy Gold and Silver with thee, nor thy Lands or Livings, Corn nor Cattle; <HI>all</HI> these must stay behind thee when thou diest; only thy Conscience, thy Book, and thy Works must go with thee: If they are good, O blessed art thou, if they are wicked, fil∣thy and unclean, O wo and ten thousand woes to thy Soul for evermore.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="002963_0047_0FE6A971A7B6ABF8"/>Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> plainly tells us, that both the <HI>quick</HI> and the <HI>dead</HI> shall hear the Trumpet, and be ga∣thered together to Judgment.</P>
<P>First, By the powerful Voice of Christ, as in the example of <HI>Lazarus, Those that are in the grave, shall bear his voice.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, By the Ministry of Angels, that <HI>shall</HI> gather the Elect from all parts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By the diligence of the Creatures, who in their kinds <HI>shall</HI> hear the Voice of God.

<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. <HI>Oh then what madness hath bewitched the hearts and souls of most men and women in the world? What do men desire? What do they hunger and thirst after?</HI> Surely for pleasures, profits and prefer∣ments?

fear of God; little or no pity to the needy members of Jesus Christ. Alas, they never think of these things, but all their desire is for the World: Ah poor blind souls! They imagine not, nor consider <HI>ibat</HI> they must leave all these behind them; they must part from them all; Thou canst not take one piece of Gold or Silver with thee, but all must be left behind, only thy Conscience, only thy Books, only thy Works must accompany thee. O then what madness is this, to seek and hunt after such things as cannot help us, nor stand us in any stead in the day of Judgment? Nay, if they be gotten wrongfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly by oppression, usury, extortion, or kept with a bad Conscience, they will be a ter∣ror unto u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the last day.</P>
<P>Let us then set not our hearts too much up∣on these things, which cannot profit us in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fiery day of Tryal. Why should we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be so fool∣ish to set our hearts upon <HI>that that</HI> cannot help us, nay, which we must leave behind us? And so improvident for the true treasures which only will avail at <HI>that</HI> day?</P>
<P>Let us therefore enter into Covenant with the Lord, to strive against all sin, especially against the particular sins and corruptions of our hearts and lives, wherein we have most dishonoured the Lord, and have raised up most guiltiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our Consciences, which will at the last con∣demn us, and let us hereafter carefully see our Covenant be kept and continued as much as in us lieth, and let us remember the words of the Prophet <HI>Esdras,</HI> in his Second Book, Chap. 7. ver. 32. <HI>The earth shall restore those that have slept in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and the most high shall appear upon the seat of Iudg∣ment, and miseries shall vanish away, and long suffer∣ing

<P>Oh then I beseech you again and again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ing that nothing shall go with you to Judgment, but only your works, to lay aside all immode∣rate care of the World; yea, and the things of this World, for these must stay behind us, and cannot help us in the day of Judgment. Let us labour for better things, for durable Treasures, for a clear Conscience to abound in good <HI>works,</HI> in <HI>Knowledge, Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance.</HI> Let us take need we are not found naked of these. O <HI>what</HI> a woful case are they in that have nothing in the world to go with them to Judgment but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> evil heart, a galled Conscience full of unclean∣ness. Their states is woful and miserable; it had been good for them they had never been burn.</P>
<P>Here a Question may be asked, how this say∣ing of St. <HI>John,</HI> can stand with that of our Sa∣viour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18. <HI>He that believeth on him is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> condemned, but he that believeth not, is condemned already.</HI> Now if the faithful Children of God shall not come into Judgment and the wick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unbelievers be condemned already, how saith he, that all shall be judged at the day of Judg∣ment?</P>
<P>I answer, it is true, that the faithful Children of God shall not come into Judgment, that is, of condemnation: Rom. 8. <HI>For there is no conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nation, &amp;c.</HI> But God will pronounce that Bles∣sed Sentence, <HI>Come ye blessed, &amp;c.</HI> As for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wicked it is true, they are condemned already.</P>
<P>First, in the decree &amp; counsel of God, be∣ing Reprobates and Castaways.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="002963_0049_0FE6A9885285DDF8"/>Secondly, In the Word of God.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In their own Conscienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are condemned already: But the full manifestati∣on of this Sentence shall not be until the day of Judgment: And so we are to understand <HI>that</HI> saying of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Eccl. 3 27. <HI>God shall judge the just and the unjust,</HI> the just to Salvation, the Un∣just to condemnation.</P>
<P>Now the third point that we propounded, is the touchstone of this Tryal, whereby <HI>all</HI> mens thoughts, words and works shall be tried. To this St. <HI>Paul</HI> answered, <HI>At the day of Judgment, God shall judge the secrets of all mens hearts by his Gospel,</HI> Rom. 2-16 <HI>Our Thoughts, our Words, and our Works,</HI> must be tryed by the Word of God, and that Thought, Word and Work, that is not according to the Commandments of God, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very idle thought, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile word, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icked work.</P>
<P>Seeing then that all our thoughts, words, and evil works, must be tryed and examined by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acred Word of God, by the Law, and by the Gospel, we have need to labour to know them, and to be acquainted with them, that we may know what is sin, and what is not sin, that so we may leave the one, and do the other. Oh what a woful case they are in, which are igno∣rant of the Word of God, ignorant men an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> women, without any knowledge? They know not what is good or evil. And therefore saith the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.8. <HI>The Lord Jesus will come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>now not God, and that obey not the Gospel of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> And therefore as you le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, love the Word of God, labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow it, and embrace it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f thou be ignorant

it, and wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not yield obedience unto it, it sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stand against thee at the day of Judgment, when thou must be tryed by it, when perhaps thou wouldest wish thou hadst but a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s time here; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, a days time to repent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an hours time to pray, and to make thy peace with God. Therefore let us all labour to be instruc∣ted in it, read it, remember it, and lead our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives by it, as long as we live, for we cannot tell how soon we shall be called to give an ac∣count of our Stewardship; and whatsoever is done contrary to it, is sin: It must come to Judgment, and the Word and our own Consci∣ences will condemn us.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>And the Sea gave up the dead which were in her, and Death and Hell deliverd up the dead that were in them, and they were judged eve∣ry min according to their Works.</HI></P>
<P>YOu have heard in the 12 verse immediate∣ly going before, how St. <HI>John saw the dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both great and small, stand before God,</HI> that is, all men and women that ever lived, or shall live until the end of the World.</P>
<P>Now here a question ariseth how can this be? <HI>How is it possible, that all men should come to Judgment?</HI> There have been many thousands drowned in the Sea, and the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes have devou∣red them; some have been slain in the field, and the Fowls have eaten their flesh; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any have been burnt, and their bones con∣sumed to ashes.</P>
<P>Then it is a very high point, a matter be∣yond all natural reason tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the dead should rise again. Men that have been drown∣ed, and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hes have eaten them, and men perhaps again have eaten the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes, and they
<PB N="96" REF="002963_0050_0FE6AA10DE7499B0"/>
have been burnt to ashes; their ashes have been scattered who knoweth whither? How then is it possible for them to rise again; In∣deed Atheists and Epicureans are not ash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣med to say, that there shall be no Resurrec∣tion, but when a man dies there is an end of all his joy, and all his misery.</P>
<P>But that the dead <HI>shall</HI> rise again, is an Arti∣cle of our Faith; <HI>We believe the Resurrection of the dead</HI>; and we know that God <HI>will</HI> in mercy reward his poor Children, and in justice punish the wicked and ungodly.</P>
<P>But we see, as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>In this life all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings happen a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke to the just and unjust.</HI> Nay, of en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Dives</HI> is full, and at ease, when <HI>La∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous</HI> is empty &amp; in misery. How then should God be just, if he should suffer his poor Chil∣dren that love and fear his Name, here to live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n misery, &amp; never to reward them; Or again, how should God be just, if he should suffer the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icked and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>godly to live at ease, if there were not a time to come, when they should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of vengeance; therefore they must come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Judgment, they must rise again, <HI>the Godly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e made partake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of life and joy, and the wicked of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame and confusion.</HI></P>
<P>So that the instruction we observe hence it this, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the dead bodies of men, both good &amp; bad, shall not always be under the power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ath, but <HI>shall</HI> one day be quickned and raised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p to life again.

the obedience of the dead. Indeed it is a pow∣erful Voice, and all must obey it. The Grave must surrender up <HI>all</HI>; for the Sea &amp; the Grave are but faithful Stewards, and must deliver up the Bodies which have been so long hidden; the living must then be congregated, and the dead shall arise and come to Judgment, and e∣very one receive according to his actions he hath done in the flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. And indeed, it is requisite it should be so in regard of Gods Justice, that his promi∣ses made to the godly, and his Threatnings a∣gainst the wicked, might at last be made good to both, which many times in this life are not. <HI>His Justice then requires that men should one day rise again.</HI> The Elect Children of God are only par∣takers of Christ's Resurrection to Eternal Glo∣ry. The ungodly indeed rise by virtue of Christ, not as he is a Redeemer, but a terrible Judge; and besides the Death of the Body, they must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffer a second Death, which is a pouring out of God's wrath on them for ever.</P>
<P>Secondly, The very Works in nature do in a sort shew this: As the <HI>Phanix,</HI> who in waxing aid, it's said, maketh a fire, and burneth her self to ashes, out of which ashes, she reviveth again. We see it in other Birds, as the Swallow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which all the Winter are said to be asleep in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oles and clifes of the Rocks, and in the Spring come abroad again. Yea, the very Trees and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants of the Earth, as in Winter, they appear to be dead, so in Spring they revive and live again.</P>
<P>And why then should any think it is impossi∣ble for God to <HI>raise our Bodies out of the dust?</HI> We see a poor ignorant man is able of Clay ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="99" REF="002963_0051_0FE64862C0ED0F80"/>
Ashes, to make a very beautiful Glass. How much more then is the ever-living and Almigh∣ty God able to raise our bodies out of the dust? But you will say, are not mens Bodies eaten of Fishes, and Men eat them again? How is it possible to raise the Bodies of these men thus consumed to dust, and mingled with the bodies of several Fishes, and of divers sorts of Beasts.</P>
<P>I Answer, that tho' it be impossible to mor∣tal men, yet it is not impossible to God; For he that created all our Bodies of nothing can make them again with something, namely, of their own matter, and sever their Bodies from all o∣ther Substances. The Atheist denies the Resur∣rection of the dead, which we will confute by the Scriptures, &amp; the Resurrection of Christ.</P>
<P>And since Christ gave life to himself when dead and in the Grave: How much more now being alive, &amp; in Heaven Glorified, is he able to raise his members from Death to Life, and to raise up those that are dead in sin, by his Spi∣rit unto newness of Life? Christ's Resurrecti∣on is both the cause and confirmation of our rising again. <HI>If we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Je∣sus, will God bring with him,</HI> 1 Thes. 4.14. And again, <HI>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 11. And to prove the Resurrection of Christ's Body, the witnesses are these: First, the <HI>Angels, Why seek ye the living among the dead? he is not here, he is risen,</HI> Luk. 24.5. 2<HI>dly,</HI> the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that rose with him, <HI>and went unto the holy City.</HI> 3<HI>dly.</HI> A forced Testimony of the Soldiers; <HI>They came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and told all things that were done.

Fourthly,</HI> The Disciples &amp; followers of Christ, the Apostles the Women, the two Disciples, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and more (saith the Text) than five hundred brethren at once: But es∣pecially the Apostle <HI>Paul, the chosen of God.</HI> Then Fifthly, his own love was shown, he bid the Woman, <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tell my brethren that I am risen,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 15. So St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his first Epistle, <HI>Chap</HI> I <HI>Verse</HI> 3. saith, <HI>Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his a∣bundant mercy hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deth not away, reserved in Heaven for you who are kept by the power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> testifies as much in divers of his Epistles: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.20 <HI>Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that sleep.</HI> Likewise <HI>Eph</HI> 2.6. <HI>He hath rai∣sed us up together, and made us fit together in Heaven with Jesus Christ.</HI> And again in <HI>Acts</HI> 3.26. <HI>Unto you first, God having raised up his Son Jesus Christ, hath sent him to bless you, in turn∣ing every one of you from his Iniquities. And af∣ter he was risen, he appeared</HI> (as the Text saith) <HI>first to Mary Magdalen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when she stood without the Sepulchre weeping.</HI></P>
<P>She teacheth us that we have cause to weep; when we have lost Christ: For he is our righ∣teousness, and our life; &amp; not without hope we must weep; for in his Resurrection we recover him with Consolation. To believe &amp; hope in our Resurrection; is a chief solace of our troubles and crosses which are but for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time; for <HI>Hope</HI> doth expect that certainly, which <HI>Faith</HI> from the Word of God doth be∣lieve

confidently. Christ's death was not on∣ly for our sins, but his Resurrection <HI>was</HI> to obtain Righteousness for us, the Holy Ghost, and Everlasting Life and Glory.</P>
<P>First, He rose for our Justification.</P>
<P>Secondly, For our Regeneration.</P>
<P>Thirdly, For our Resurrection to everlast∣ing Glory.</P>
<P>All the benefits of Christ's Death, are the fruits which we receive by his Resurrection; by Christ's Resurrection he applies the bene∣fit to us which he merited for us of his own free love.</P>
<P>The Fruits of Christ's Resurrection are, First, we are confirmed, that by his merit he hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perfectly satisfied for our sins. Secondly, in the application of Christ's benefits, that could not be conferred or applied, except he had rose a∣gain. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In the Gift of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> by which Christ <HI>Regenerates</HI> us, and gives us Eternal Life. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> We are by Christ's Resurrection preserved in a perpetual and ap∣plied Righteousness begun, which shall be con∣summated in Eternal Life. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> In the <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> of our Bodies.</P>
<P>First, Because Christ is our Head, and we his Members.</P>
<P>Secondly, He hath taken away sin the cause of Death.</P>
<P>Thirdly, He received Life for us.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We have the <HI>same Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, By the Man Christ, came the <HI>Re∣surrection from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly and lastly, The Fruit of Christ's <HI>Resurrection,</HI> is the consummation of all bene∣fits,
<PB N="102" REF="002963_0053_0FE6A98970E716B8"/>
and the glorification of his Church Mili∣tant, and therefore with <HI>Paul,</HI> let us believe in the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of Christ, who rose the third day from the dead; to make us partakers of his Righteousness, Sanctification and Glorification, purchased by his Merits only. John 16 <HI>These things have I spoken</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>unto you, that in me you might have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation: But be of good chear, I have overcome the World:</HI> And St <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Rom</HI> 14.9. <HI>To this end Christ both died and rose again, and revived that he might be Lord both of the living and the dead.</HI></P>
<P>So then this place proves and confirms that Article of our Faith, that we believe the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> of the Dead. For tho' a man die by Sea or Land, in his Bed, or in the Field, St. <HI>John</HI> saith, The Sea <HI>shall</HI> give up all that have been drowned, Death and Hell, that is the Grave <HI>shall</HI> deliver the dead in them, so as all must come to Judgment, of what Death soever they die. O then, see (Beloved) how the Devil be witcheth many a poor ignorant soul, When he is in mi∣sery, distress and calamity, or in a deep melan∣cholly, the Devil perswadeth him to become his own Executioner, to end his misery and shame, by hanging himself, cutting his <HI>own</HI> Throat, drowning himself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>we know</HI> and hear, that he prevaileth much in these days: Some being in disgrace, as <HI>Nebuchadnezza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bito∣phel</HI>; some <HI>with</HI> the gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of sin, and sling of Conscience, as <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> and some being crossed in the World's affairs, cut their own Throats, or <HI>otherwise</HI> destroy themselves. Now they foolishly think by this means to end their grief. When alas, alas, they do but hasten their <HI>own destruction,</HI> as if a man should (to avoid a
<PB N="103" REF="002963_0053_0FE6A98970E716B8"/>
little smoak) cast himself into a flaming fire. So they to avoid this little grief of their Bo∣dies, plunge both Body and Soul into Eternal Torments: For <HI>what</HI> case is it for any to de∣stroy themselves, seeing they must come to Judgment: Tho' they kill or drown themselves, <HI>The Water and Grave must one day give up their dead.</HI> From hence let us learn, to arm our selves if Satan should tempt us to such horrible facts, to cast away our selves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us <HI>answer</HI> him, we may not cast away that which Christ hath bought with his own Blood; nay, let us answer him, that we shall not thereby end our misery, but increase it.</P>
<P>Now if you demand, by what means the dead <HI>shall</HI> then arise at the last day; I answer. It is by the mighty power of the Voice of Christ, <HI>The hour shall come,</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>in which all that are in the Grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and come forth.</HI> And to shew the wonder∣ful power of the voice of Christ. It is compa∣red to the sound of a Trumpet, the loudest and shrillest of all Instruments, Thes. 1.25. <HI>For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</HI> Such shall be the power and force of this Voice of the Lord Jesus, that it shall be heard over the whole World. Nay, though men have lain ma∣ny thousand Years rotten in the Grave, yet they <HI>shall</HI> hear it. and come forth to Judgment. Nay the Devils &amp; damned Spirits shall be constrain∣ed to appear at his Voice. No Prince, nor Monarch, no King, nor Noble-man shall be able to absent himself from Gods Presence, nor once dare to plead in our Cause, but they must be
<PB N="104" REF="002963_0054_0FE6A989906CD580"/>
forced to obey the Voice of the Son of God, and come to Judgment. Christ was a Lamb at his Passion, and some shall find him a Lion at his <HI>Resurrection</HI></P>
<P>Seeing then we must all hear the Voice of the Lord Jesus at the day of Judgment, and we can∣not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> come forth out of our Graves unto this J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gment. O let us now obey his Voice in the Ministry of his Gospel. and embrace the Word, and the voice of his Ministers. If we do not leave sin, hear our Saviour Jesus Christ speaking unto us in his Word, and embrace his Truth; Then let us know, that we shall one day hear another voice; when we shall be compelled to come before him to condemnation.</P>
<P>Therefore in all afflictions and miseries what∣soever, and especially in diseases and death, we must strengthen our selves in the future Resur∣rection, remembring that of the Apostle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.20, 21 <HI>Our conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto him∣self.</HI> Every Christian. as in the eleventh Article of our Creed, doth believe the <HI>Resurrection of the body.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 15.10.21. saith, <HI>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep; for since by man came death, by man also came the Resurrection from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But how?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> God that in his Omnipotency made our Bodies, and all things else of nothing, can after, in our corruption, restore in the same substance and quality to Eternity, for with him is nothing impossible, Luke 1.37. <HI>With God no∣thing
<PB N="105" REF="002963_0054_0FE6A989906CD580"/>
is impossible.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> satisfieth this scruple abundantly and sufficiently, which is able to stop the mouth of all Atheists whatsoever: <HI>O thou Fool,</HI> (saith he) <HI>that which thou sowest is not quickned, except it die, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bear grain, as it were wheat or some other grain; but God giveth it a body, as it pleaseth him; and to every seed his own body.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' it pleaseth God not to let thee know the time of the Resurrection, to himself only known; yet the manner hath he left to be shewed by the Apostles, and they have record∣ed it for us, as in 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.16. <HI>For the Lord him∣self shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angels, and with the Trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we for ever be with the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This hope of the Resurrection hath ever been the greatest consolation to the godly in their afflictions, whence <HI>Tertullian</HI> saith. <HI>That the confi∣dence of a Christian is in the Resurrection from the dead.</HI> An example hereof is in <HI>Job,</HI> in the midst of his affliction, he said, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and tho' after my skin worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</HI> What can be more manifest? No man (after Christ, than he before Christ's appearance in the flesh) could speak more plainly and certainly of the Resur∣rection, from the confidence of our Resurrec∣tion we contemn things present, in hope of the future, for all flesh shall see the Salvation of God.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="002963_0055_0FE6A991E6638F78"/>Of the Resurrection, <HI>Isaiah</HI> saith, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI> 26 <HI>verse 19.

Let us now come to the Uses.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. First, Seeing of what death soever men die, either by Fire or Water, or howsoever, they must one day come to Judgment. Let us then beware of that ungodly thought and devilish persuasion, that runs in most wicked mens minds, that think that when they die, there is an end of all their misery. And although they have been very grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ners, yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey escape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that they and their sins shall be buried together.</P>
<P>No, no, (p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) they much deceive them∣selves. However thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, thou shall come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o judgment; and death is so far from ending
<PB N="107" REF="002963_0055_0FE6A991E6638F78"/>
thy misery, that is a broad Gate to let thee in∣to it. For so soon as the rich man died, he <HI>was</HI> presently in Hell Torments.</P>
<P>Therefore let us take heed how we wish as foolish men do in their sickness, old age or mi∣sery. <HI>O would I were dead, then I should be out of my pain.</HI> Oh! no, if thou be not a Child of God, and a repentant sinner, it had been better for thee never to have been born, or to be a Toad or a Serpent. And thou shalt find, that death is so far from easing thy pain, that it <HI>will</HI> bring thee to ten thousand times more pain &amp; torment, even in Hell Fire for ever. Therefore let us not think that death shall end the mise∣ries of wicked men.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. <HI>Secondly</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seeing that all men must rise to Judgment, and by what means soever they die, they must be called to account: This is a wonderful comfort unto God's poor Chil∣dren, who abide more trouble and grief than they? Who are more hated, reviled, crossed, and wronged than they? Their life here for the most part is nothing else but a life of misery; but their comfort here is this, that they shall rise again, and then the <HI>Case shall be altered,</HI> then their Misery shall be turned into Felicity, Joy and Happiness. Hast thou been poor here? There thou shalt be rich, &amp; possess a happy Kingdom, as <HI>Lazarus</HI> did. Hast thou been hungry and thirsty here? There thou shalt taste of the Tree of Life. Hast thou been wretched and naked here? There thou shalt be cloathed with the precious Robes of Christ's Righteousness, and instead of Rags of Infamy and Reproach, which we put on here, <HI>we shall be crowned with a Crown of immor∣tal
<PB N="108" REF="002963_0056_0FE6A99200FE8828"/>
Glory,</HI> &amp;c. But it is not so with the Wick∣ed and Ungodly, for they having taken their Pleasures here, and received their Portion in this present World, shall rise to Judgment, to hear the heavy Sentence of Condemnation de∣nounc'd against them, and now to <HI>he cast into that Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone, which is the second Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. Thirdly, Seeing St. <HI>John</HI> saith, that all shall come to Judgment, these Bodies of ours, though they be drown'd, burnt to Ashes, or howsoever they be consumed, yet they <HI>shall</HI> rise again, either to Life Eternal, or Death Eternal: Should not this make us all (Beloved) for to look to our selves, to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we do not use our Bodies to the Dishonour of God, knowing that our Bodies are the living Temples of the Holy Ghost? Wouldst thou have thy Body to be partaker of Life, Felicity, Glory, and Salva∣tion in Heaven? Then use thy Body now to the Glory of God upon Earth, to hear his Holy Word, to sanctifie his Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if thou use thy Body to sin, as Swearing, Drunkenness, Whoredom, <HI>&amp;c..</HI> Then know that thy Body <HI>shall</HI> rise again to Judgment, to be tormented for ever. Do but consider the rich Glutton who had abused his Body in surfeiting and Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c..</HI> What became of it? Was he not tormented in Hell at last? And as he had given his tongue unto swearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> now he cries, <HI>His Tongue, his Tongue:</HI> Oh that all sinful Wretches would but think of this one Example of God's Judgment, that if they abuse their Bodies as this man did, that they shall then taste of the same Judgment.</P>
<P>Wouldst thou have thy Body glorified?
<PB N="109" REF="002963_0056_0FE6A99200FE8828"/>
Then Glorify God in thy Body, dost thou think that thy <HI>Soul shall be saved,</HI> and thy <HI>Body glorified,</HI> if thou use the members thereof to sin, to uncleanness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oh no, let us not deceive our own Souls, it cannot be: For saith the A∣postle, <HI>how can we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 4 4<HI>thly,</HI> Seeing that the Holy Ghost saith that whatsoever death we die, <HI>we shall rise again</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and God's Children only shall rise to Life and Glory: This may teach us not to weep and mourn immoderately for our Friends deceased. For it is a kind of envy to bewail those that are at rest and gone to happiness.</P>
<P>True it is, that our Saviour wept for <HI>Laza∣rus</HI> and the Disciples made great lamentation for <HI>Stephen</HI>: And so we have great cause to mourn and weep when Holy Men are taken a∣way; we ought not to be as stocks and stones, or senseless Creatures, without affection. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must needs grieve the heart of a Husband to part with a Loving, Godly, &amp; Religious Wife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc; But we ought to moderate our mourning, that we weep and mourn not overmuch, for they shall rise again. <HI>I would not have you to be ig∣norant, Brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye Sorrow not even as those which have no hope,</HI> 1 Thes. 4.13.</P>
<P>Where the Holy Ghost tells us, that the dead in Christ do not die <HI>properly,</HI> but lay them down to take a sweet sleep, after their long and tedious labours and troubles in this World, and afterwards they must rise again to Life, Happi∣ness, Liberty, Glory, and Salvation.</P>
<P>Wherefore then should we mourn excessively, and weep &amp; lament at the death of our Friends,
<PB N="110" REF="002963_0057_0FE6A9960EC58268"/>
seeing they do not perish, they are not cast a∣way? Oh no, their Souls are presently in joy; and their wearied Bodies are at rest in the Grave as in a Bed of Down, until the day of Judgment, and then they shall rise to Glory. And whether this separation of our Souls from our Bodies, shall be by voice, or a secret guil∣tiness of our own Consciences: It is all one, for all must rise &amp; come to Judgment. The Angels they shall obey his Voice, they shall be his reapers at this great Day of Harvest, and they shall make a separation at his Word; for by the Power and Omnipotency of Christ shall this separation be. Wherefore let us endea∣vour to die to sin, before we die to nature; &amp; let us strive to bury it, before it bury us; for sin brings only guilt and shame in this Life, and utter perdition in the Life to come. There∣fore, O Lord, let my eyes be as a Well. Spring every morning to shed forth tears of true Re∣pentance for my iniquities.</P>

<HEAD>And they were judged every one according to his works.</HEAD>
<P>NOW mark, I pray, how the Holy Ghost repeats this point again and again, he insists often upon it; he said before, <HI>The Books were opened, and the dead were judged according to those things written in the Books.</HI> And now again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saith, <HI>They were judged every man according to his works.</HI> What should be the cause why the Holy Ghost so often repeats this point, again, &amp; again?

<PB N="111" REF="002963_0057_0FE6A9960EC58268"/>
of this, that they must give an account of their works. Tell the wicked sinner of his ungodly ways, of his Prophaness, contempt of Gods Word, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What do they say? Do they quake and tremble? Do their hearts and souls even yern in them? Oh, no, no, they flatter themselves with this conceit, <HI>God is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> merciful,</HI> or say, <HI>God forgive me I thought not of it, I was urged to it:</HI> And so abuse the mer∣cies of God, to excuse all their abominati∣ons. And thus it is in the vile heart of man, to think he shall never come to account for his sins, nor receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a reward according to his works, whether they be good or evil.</P>
<P>How needful is it then, for all men that are blinded with ignorance, and so deluded by the Devil, and their own imagination, to pray to the Lord for the assistance of his <HI>ho∣ly Spirit,</HI> to guide them in all their ways, and to mollifie their hard and obdurate hearts, that they may be sensible of their wicked Actions, acknowledging<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the true peni∣tent sinner, the Wrath and Judgment of God due unto them for every sin, to render all possible thanks for the preservation of their Lives from day to day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for shall they with a quiet Conscience be comforted in this Life, and end their days with assurance of a joyful Resurrection in the Life to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN handling this weighty point of Religion, the (second coming of Christ to Judgment,) I have shewed you from the mouth of God▪ First, what manner of Person the Judge <HI>shall</HI> be, and how he shall come: namely, like a mighty Prince, with great Power, Majesty and Glory, with an innumerable company of Arch Angels and Angels, with all the Host of Hea∣ven; there is the number of them that shall appear at the last day, <HI>even all,</HI> and leave Hea∣ven empty, as it were, of Angels; for at this Sentence the whole Trinity will be present, so that there will be no need of Angels in Hea∣ven, to do any office to wait upon God, or on the Holy Ghost, while this Sentence is passing, unto the great comfort of his poor Members, and to the terror and amazement of all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="002963_0058_0FE6A996290674E8"/>Secondly, You have heard who <HI>shall</HI> be judg∣ed, <HI>Both great and small.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The manner how Judgment shall proceed. Namely, By the written Records, which are the Books of Mens Consciences,</P>
<P>And now in the last place we come to the execution of Judgment upon wicked Repro∣bates and ungodly in these two last Verses: For when Judgment is pronounced according to their works, when Christ Jesus, which is the second Person in the Sacred Trinity, shall say unto them, <HI>Depart from me ye cursed into Hell-fire, there to remain for ever with the Devil and his An∣gels,</HI> &amp;c. Then immediately the execution of this Sentence shall follow; for saith St. <HI>John, Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of fire; that is the second Death.</HI></P>
<P>First, We are to enquire and seek the true meaning of the Text, because every word may move a Question. For,</P>
<P>Quest 1. <HI>What is Death, that he should be cast into Hell-fire?</HI> Is Death any Creature? Is Death subject unto pain and torments? Surely, no, Death is no body, it hath no sense nor feeling; Death is no Creature, but only the deprivation of Life. Again, What a strange speech is this, <HI>that Death</HI> shall be cast into Hell: How can this be?</P>
<P>Quest: 2. Secondly, <HI>What is meant by the Lake of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</HI> Is Hell a Water, or a Fire like unto our F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e?</P>
<P>Quest. 3. And lastly, <HI>We are to consider, What is meant by the Second Death, into which all Repro∣bates must be cast without Recovery?</HI></P>
<P>First Here by Death and Hell, is meant not Death it self, nor Hell it self, but the Heirs of
<PB N="114" REF="002963_0059_0FE6A9A10E952780"/>
Death and Hell, that is <HI>all the Reprobates</HI> that shall be cast into <HI>Hell</HI> fire, and there abide for evermore. Thus you see what is here meant by Death and <HI>Hell</HI>; namely, the Heirs of <HI>Death</HI> and fire brands of <HI>Hell,</HI> all Reprobates, all s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iff-necked <HI>Pharoahs,</HI> all bloody <HI>Cains,</HI> all covetous <HI>Nabals,</HI> all treacherous and betraying <HI>Judas's,</HI> all impenitent sinners, that live and die in their sin, <HI>all these shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. Seeing the Holy Ghost gives these Titles and Names unto all wicked and un∣godly sinners, even <HI>Death</HI> &amp; <HI>Hell</HI>: This shews the wonderful misery, and cursed Estate of all those that live and die in their sins, with∣out Repentance. Alas! It is so woful and damnable, that they are even called Death &amp; Hell it self.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>This shews the misery of those that die in their sins.</HEAD>
<P>Oh then, let all sinners that live and de∣light in sin, take heed to themselves. You see the woful misery of all impenitent sinners, namely, that they are no better than Vessels of Wrath, the Heirs of Eternal Death, and Fire∣brands of <HI>Hell</HI> for evermore. Oh that all sin∣ners would forethink of this woful misery that hangs over their sinful heads. What a strange kind of speech is this, &amp; of what force? When God called such Reprobates, even Death and <HI>Hell</HI> it self. Ah poor Wretches! Ah miserable and woful Creatures, which are but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Hell</HI> it self! O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would to God that the Drun∣kard, the Swearer, the Prophaner of the Lords Day, the Adulterer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Would lay this to heart, that though they see not their misery,
<PB N="115" REF="002963_0059_0FE6A9A10E952780"/>
nor the woful estate wherein they live, but chear themselves in their sinful ways, yet they are no better than the heirs of vengeance and Wrath of God, nay indeed very Death &amp; Hell it self; and one day the Vials of Gods Wrath will be poured upon them.</P>
<P>True it is, that Wicked men do as the people did in <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s time, <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.21. Tho' they lived in horrible sin, yet they made a League with Death, and were at an Agreement with the Grave; they had taken a Lease of Death and Hell; as the Rich Man, which said to his Soul, <HI>Soul take thine ease, for thou hast Goods and Rich∣es laid up for many years,</HI> and so live in sin, with∣out fear of punishment: But the Lord tells 'em, he will break the Covenant. and disanul their Agreement. And although they have lived a long time in sin, yet in the end Death <HI>will</HI> knock at their Doors, and then seize them, and they must pay dear for their long Lease, even the loss of Body and Soul for ever.</P>
<P>And is not this the daily practice of most men &amp; women at this day? Do they not make a Covenant with Death, and labour to be at an Agreement with Hell? Men live in Swearing, Lying, Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if they thought they should never die, they imagine they shall escape for all their sins. But (poor Souls) let them know, that Death and Hell will seize up∣on them. Nay, if they live and die in their sins without repentance, let them know that they are no better than <HI>Death and Hell it self, and they must be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Here you may see what a horrible and cursed thing <HI>sin is in the sight of God,</HI> for sin ma∣keth men become guilty of Eternal Death, and
<PB N="116" REF="002963_0060_0FE6A9A123E44B20"/>
Fire-brands of Hell.

Even so sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch is Treason against the Majesty of God, when it is brought forth, it brings us to Death and Hell; for Death and Hell is the reward of sin.</P>
<P><HI>And Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of fire.</HI> Would you know what shall become of the prophane Wretches of the World! The Blasphemer, Adulterer, Drunkard, Idolater, Swearer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> saith here in plain terms, <HI>They shall be cast into the Lake of fire.</HI> Thus was the rich glutton, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.

<P>Now if a Blasphemer, or an Adulterer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should have but this punishment, to hold one of his Fingers in the flame of a Candle one quar∣ter of an hour, how could he endure it? But if a man should be roasted alive upon a Grid-I∣ron, or boyled in a Chaldron of molten Lead, what misery were this? Whose heart would not quake and melt to think of it? Yet these are nothing in comparison of those most extream and endless torments in this Lake of Fire, when both Body and Soul shall burn and broyl, and as it were fry, yet never be consumed in those scorching flames which cannot be quenched. Most men are afraid to commit Treason, because Traytors are so grievously punished; they are drawn, hanged and quartered; but alas, Men are not afraid to commit Treason against the King of Heaven, though they must be cast in∣to a Lake of Fire for evermore. Men are a∣fraid
<PB N="117" REF="002963_0060_0FE6A9A123E44B20"/>
to offend a Prince for fear of death, and yet our Saviour bids us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.28. <HI>Not fear them that can kill the Body, and can do no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but to fear him that can cast both body and soul into Hell fire.</HI></P>
<P>And yet we see that men and women are more afraid to offend Man than God, <HI>That can cast both body and soul into Hell fire.</HI></P>
<P>If we should see a Child fall into the fire, and hear it cry pitifully, and the very bowels should be burnt out, how would it grieve us, &amp; make our hearts bleed within us? How much more then should it grieve us to see, not a Child, but even our own Bodies and Souls cast away for ever by sin, <HI>into the lake of fire that cannot be quenched</HI>? If a man should come amongst us, &amp; cry Fire, Fire, thy House is all of a flaming Fire, thy Corn and thy Cattle, thy Wife and thy Children, and all thou hast, are consumed by fire; how would this astonish us! And make the very hair to stand upright upon one heads, and tears to gush our of our eyes. Be∣hold then and see the Spirit of God cries out, Fire, Fire, even the dreadful fire of Hell gapet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ready to devour, not thy House, Corn or Cat∣tle, but thy poor Soul, and that for evermore. Then, how should this break out hard &amp; flinty hearts asunder, and make them to bleed, if we have any spark of Grace, any Care of our Souls, that they may not be tormented in this Lake of Fire for ever.</P>
<P>I wil leave the further handling of this point, until I come unto the next verse, where the Holy Ghost again, the better to make it sink into our hard hearts, <HI>That whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="002963_0061_0FE6A9A3302C13B8"/>Now by <HI>Fire,</HI> in this place, we must not con∣ceive a material Fire like unto ours, but the Holy Ghost means here the <HI>second Death,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at is, <HI>not of the Body only, but of Eternal Death and Damnati∣on both of body and Soul for evermore.</HI> This is the Second Death, &amp; by this we may plainly see, there is a double Death, <HI>There is the first Death, and then the second Death.</HI></P>
<P>The First Death is the separation of the Soul from the Body, and that is common to all; the Children of God die this Death as well as the wicked; yet there is some difference; for Death is no curse to the Children of God, because Christ's Death hath taken away the sting of Death; it can neither dismay nor hurt them, no, it is but as a door for our Souls to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: But the second they never taste of; no Child of God needs to fear the second Death, Rom. 8 1. <HI>For there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI> Now as the First Death is only a separation of the Soul from the Body, so the Second Death is a total and final separation both of Soul &amp; Body from God for ever; and this second Death stands principally in these three points.</P>
<P>First, That all wicked and ungodly sinners, that live and die in their sins, <HI>shall be punished with everlasting destruction, being severed from the blessed Presence of the Lord for ever, and from the glory of his Power,</HI> 2 Thes. 1 9 Oh what a woful death is this, to be deprived of the blessed and comfortable Presence of God! <HI>Wherein the bap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and joy of Gods children shall stand in the be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing of God, and enjoying his presence for ever∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> Then what misery and woe will this be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wicked, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cast out of the glorious
<PB N="119" REF="002963_0061_0FE6A9A3302C13B8"/>
presence of the Lord for ever, who alone is the Fountain of Life and Happiness.</P>
<P>Secondly, The second Death stands in this, that wicked men and women shall not only be severed in Body and Soul from the blessed and glorious presence of the Almighty for ever; but shall be cast into the Lake of Fire, &amp; have their abode with the Devils, and all the damn∣ed Spirits in Hell, where there is no joy, nor comfort, nor ease, but weeping and wailing, &amp; gnashing of Teeth If a man should be cast into a deep and dark Dungeon, full of Toads and Serpents, what comfort I pray, could be have but to wish for Death: That is the death that all impenitent sinners must die, they must be cast out of the sweet and comfortable pre∣sence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and thrown head-long into the terrible Lake of Fire and Brimstone, there to be tormented for evermore.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The third thing wherein this se∣cond Death doth consist, is, that all Repro∣bates shall be punished with everlasting perditi∣on; they shall be tormented both Body and Soul with unspeakable torments: The wrath and ven∣geance of God shall seize upon them, and feed on them, as fire do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h on pitch and brimstone, where they shall be ever burning and broiling, and yet never be consumed; ever in pain and torment. Our Saviour compareth the wonder∣ful torment of this second death, to a Furnace of Fire: What a woful torment is it to be cast into a furnace of Fire, and there to lie many thousand years? This is a torment that cannot be expressed. Again he saith, <HI>Isa</HI> 66.24. <HI>This their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rw in shall not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and their fire shall not be quenched.</HI> Now what can a man do, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="120" REF="002963_0062_0FE6A9A34F96F780"/>
should have a worm always gnawing at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heart? This is the state of all wicked men and women, they shall always have a worm, even grief and anguish, &amp; ever gnawing at their heart, and biting at their Consciences; and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worm shall never die nor kill them, but be e∣ver gnawing and wounding them. And this condition of the damned in Hell is miserable in three respects.</P>
<P>First, In regard of the degrees of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, In regard of the place.</P>
<P>And Thirdly, In regard of the perpetuity thereof.</P>
<P>The first appears in the loss of our blessed Communion with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <HI>In whose presence is life, and at whose right hand there is pleasure for evermore</HI></P>
<P>And thus shall the wicked be punished at that day with <HI>everlasting Destruction from the presence of the Lord,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.9.</P>
<P>A second degree of their misery consists in the Society they shall have for ever with the Devil and his Angels, according to that of our Saviour, <HI>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> A punish∣ment which we may guess to be intolerable; to burn and not to consume, to live, and have no end; includes all woe and misery whatsoe∣ver: Cursed of Christ himself, cursed of the Angels; whose curse will always remain in their Consciences: Cursed shall they be like∣wise of the Devils themselves, whose curse shall be always tormenting them; never have rest nor ease; perpetually howling and cry∣ing which is their Musick, their joy nothing but cursing and blasphemy.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="002963_0062_0FE6A9A34F96F780"/>But especially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spect of that Horror, Torment and Pain, that shall seize upon the Bodies and Souls of all wicked and ungodly men at the last day: Which will be such as <HI>shall</HI> make them cry out, <HI>unto rocks and moun∣tains to fall upon them and cover them, when there shall be tribulation, anguish and wrath upon every man that doth evil,</HI> Rom. 13.4.</P>
<P>Secondly, The place shall add likewise to their misery, and that is Hell, the proper place of the damned after death: This in the Scrip∣ture is called <HI>Hell, the bottomless Gulpb, utter darkness, the fearful Tophet, the Dungeon of De∣spair, the burning Lake, the hollow Cave, the Chaos of all Confusion, the Grave of Perdition, whose Fur∣na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is always burning, whose Fire is made by God's Wrath and his Power upholds it, and it is, blown with the bellows of his Indignation, it is unquenchable, even prepared for the Devil and his Angels</HI> And therefore Christ bids them, <HI>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,</HI> &amp;c. &amp; all to shew the miserable condition of those that are there.</P>
<P>And last of all the Eternity of the Punish∣ment that the damned shall suffer, adds not a little to the misery of the wicked; they <HI>shall</HI> suffer and endure the heat and burning of Gods Wrath for ever: It shall never have an end; It <HI>shall</HI> be without hope of intermission, for saith St. <HI>John, Rev.</HI> 14.11. <HI>The smoak of their Torment shall ascend evermore, and they shall have no rest Day nor Night.</HI> What a punishment will this be! Let all Men and Women con∣sider.</P>
<P>First, It is the loss of Almighty God, and of his most Glorious and Blessed Presence, which the Saints and Angels always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enjoy,
<PB N="122" REF="002963_0063_0FE6A9AE8C0BC168"/>
which is his Love, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rcy, his Bounty, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eauty, his gracious Aspects, and all his Eter∣nal Attributes, the loss of Heaven, which is un∣speakable, past the thoughts of man, the loss of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Society of the Holy Martyrs, Angels, and Arch Angels, whose Glory, Riches and Trea∣sures never have an end. Thus I have shewed you what the second death is, and also wherein it doth consist.</P>
<P>Now the question will be, Who shall be cast into this Lake of Fire? Who are they that <HI>shall</HI> die the second death, which is so misrable and woful? For there is no man or woman that li∣veth, I think, but suppose that they shall escape this death, they hope they shall be sa∣ved, and so escape this Flaming Fire, and by that hope, defer their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pentance till old Age, till they have no other employment. And there∣fore now you <HI>shall</HI> see who they are that shall be cast into it. There are some marked out unto us, <HI>Rev</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.8 <HI>The fearful and unbelievers, and abo∣minable and Murtherers, and Whoremongers, and Sor∣cerers, and Liars,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall have their part in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</HI> So then the Holy Ghost tells us that all impenitent sinners shall be damned, and cast into this Lake of Fire which is the se∣cond death; for after this there is no Repen∣tance, no recovery; there will be a great Gulf, as <HI>Abraham</HI> told <HI>Dives,</HI> between the Godly and Ungodly: The Godly shall see and behold the Ungodly in Hell, as <HI>Lazarus</HI> did <HI>Dives</HI> in Hell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Torments.</P>
<P>Then how strange is this? The Holy Ghost tells us who shall be damned and cast into the Lake of Fire, all impenitent sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, the Blas∣phemer,
<PB N="123" REF="002963_0063_0FE6A9AE8C0BC168"/>
the Drunkard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet no man (almost) w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll consider this: <HI>Well,</HI> the Spirit of God cannt lie: he saith, <HI>That all wicked and ungodly sinners shall be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st into the Lake of fire, which is the second Death.</HI> Now tell a wicked wretch of his sin, as his Swearing <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and what <HI>will</HI> he say, <HI>Tush, God is merciful, I hope I shall be saved:</HI> Is not this I pray, to give the Holy Ghost the Lye? Tell the Drunkard or Prophener of the Lords day, <HI>that</HI> they must one day give an account for it, or that they <HI>shall</HI> be damned? do they believe this; Oh, no, no, for if they did, how durst they be so bold to live in sin: Well, let these vile Wretches that say they hope to be saved as well as the best; yet know that this is the truth of God, the Holy Ghost tells us plainly, <HI>That all Unbelievers, and Thieves, and Murtherers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone; which is the Second Death.</HI></P>
<P>But those whose hearts tremble for fear of these things, whose Souls do melt for fear of this second Death, if you would know how to escape this terrible Lake of Fire, and how to a∣void this the second Death, which is eternal damnation and torment both of Body &amp; Soul, you shall see how the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> doth not <HI>only</HI> shew you how to escape <HI>Hell,</HI> but to come to Heaven, not only to avoid damnation in this Lake of Fire, but to obtain Salvation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in the Blessed and Glorious Presence of God for evermore. Now mind what the Holy Ghost teacheth in the 6th Verse of this Chapter, <HI>Bles∣sed and happy is he that hath his part in the first Re∣surrection, for on such the second death shall have no power; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all be the Priests of God and
<PB N="124" REF="002963_0064_0FE6A9AEA1405440"/>
of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years, that is for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Now would you know what manner of men and women <HI>shall</HI> escape this second death, and eternal damnation in this Lake of <HI>Hell</HI> Fire, the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> saith, they &amp; none but they that have their parts in the first Resurrection. So it is manifest in these words, <HI>that</HI> there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo Re∣surrections, and als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h: The chil∣dren of God have a double Resur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection &amp; one death, but all wicked and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sinners have on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Resurrection, and a double death. Now let us see what is meant by this first Resurrection, name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, our rising out of the Grave of sin, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewness of Life: This is the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Resurrection, <HI>You hath be quickned, who are dead in Tresp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses and sins, Eph</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1. <HI>Therefore we are burned with Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in Baptism into death, that as like as Christ was raised from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld walk in newness of Life,</HI> Rom. 6 4 Now would you know whether you <HI>shall</HI> escape <HI>eternal Fire</HI> in <HI>Hell,</HI> even this second D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath? Then look into your own Souls; <HI>are you quic∣kned in the inner man? Do you hate sin as much when it is committed by your self, as by others?</HI> Do you labour to mortify and keep under the Works of the Flesh &amp; walk in <HI>all</HI> holy Du∣ties and Obedience, both to God and Man? Remember what is said, <HI>There is no condemna∣tion to them that are in Christ, which walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Blessed and Happy are they that have part in the first Resurrection:</HI> Rom 8. Where he shews <HI>that</HI> none <HI>shall</HI> be blessed, none <HI>shall</HI> have part in the first Resurrection, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be freed from the second Death, but such as are Sanctified, &amp; live a God∣ly
<PB N="125" REF="002963_0064_0FE6A9AEA1405440"/>
Life. Therefore if you desire to be blessed, and escape the second death, which is everlast∣ing damnation both of Body and Soul, then <HI>la∣bour to live a Godly Life</HI> here, for these two <HI>Justi∣fication</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> cannot be severed.</P>
<P>And this is a very great Comfort to <HI>all</HI> the true Members of Christ, that repent &amp; for∣sake their sins, &amp; strive to conquer their un∣ruly passions, bearing patiently what wicked men lay upon them, &amp; strive <HI>to live a Godly Life,</HI> though they are in Misery, Poverty, or Want, and in the end die the first Death of the Body yet they <HI>shall</HI> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed from the second Death, <HI>that</HI> is from Eternal Death. The <HI>Gates of Hell shall not prevail</HI> against them. And therefore as you <HI>love your Souls,</HI> as you desire to be blessed, &amp; to escape eternal Damnation, which is the second death. Labour to have a part in the first Resur∣rection, to die to sin, before you die to Nature, and to live in newness of Life.</P>
<P>But as for wicked and ungodly sinners, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t live</HI> in sin, <HI>delight</HI> in sin, and <HI>that</HI> have no par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the first Resurrection, their case is woful <HI>that</HI> be subject to the second, <HI>that</HI> is eternal death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> damnation: <HI>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall also die,</HI> Rom. 8.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Therefore deceive not your selves as many do which think if they come to Church, hear the; Word, and receive the Sacrament, <HI>all</HI> is <HI>Well t</HI> they hope God <HI>will</HI> be merciful to them, &amp; <HI>tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> they <HI>shall</HI> not be damned. <HI>Well,</HI> mark what say, thou mayst come to Church <HI>duly</HI> hear the Word of God as long as thou Livest, receive the Sacrament as often as thou wilt; but if thou hast not thy part in the first Resurrec∣tion, <HI>that</HI> is, unless thou <HI>live a Godly Life,</HI> un∣less
<PB N="126" REF="002963_0065_0FE6A9B143FABCE0"/>
thou become a new Creature, surely thy e∣state is lamentable, &amp; thy part is in the Lake of fire and Brimstone, which is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> second Death. Therefore <HI>let</HI> no man deceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself, to think, because he hears the Word, professeth the Gospel, receives the Sacrament <HI>that</HI> therefore he is well enough. No, no, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou hear never so much; if thou live i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin, swearing drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thy estate i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miserable, because thou art not freed from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> second Death.</P>
<P>And mark this difference The Children of God have two Resurrections, and one Death; they rise from sin in this Life, to newness and holiness of Life; and they rise at the Last Day to Eternal Life in Heaven, and therefore truly blessed. But graceless and ungodly sinners have two deaths, and but one Resurrection, they die in sin here, then when they are dead in sin, and <HI>delight</HI> in sin here, and so they die the first Death of the Body, &amp; an Eternal Death, <HI>the second Death of Body and Soul in Hell.</HI> And as they never had part in the first Resurrection, so <HI>the</HI> second Resurrection is only to Judgment, to Death. Nor is <HI>that all</HI> to <HI>die and go to Hell,</HI> for they <HI>shall be</HI> in the Sea of Miseries, &amp; in an Ocean of Calamities, Fire continually fla∣ming about them, and yet not wasted, nor they consumed. Then the worm of their Conscien∣ces which they never felt in their former Life, <HI>shall</HI> bite and gnaw within them, rage &amp; mad∣ness, and wrathful indignation be among them: When they <HI>shall</HI> look up, &amp; behold the Angels and Saints Triumphing and Rejoycing, what a terror <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> this be, to behold nothing about them, but <HI>Devils</HI> to affright them, Brimstone,

They <HI>shall</HI> weep and <HI>howl</HI> and cry, and no man pity them; &amp; <HI>shall weep</HI> with <HI>bitter</HI> Tears, because they <HI>shall</HI> know <HI>their</HI> miseries are past <HI>all</HI> recovery, and their Re∣pentance too <HI>late</HI>; Then they <HI>will</HI> begin to curse their Birth-day, and their Parents with brought <HI>them</HI> up; and the Paps which have them suck, and the Place and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Air that gave them their first Breath; and <HI>will</HI> cryout,

<P>THE former Verse shews us the execution of the last Judgment upon all wicked and ungodly sinners, and of that we spake the last time. Now in this Verse we may observe the different Estate of the Children of God, &amp; of the Wicked, for as there are but two sorts
<PB N="129" REF="002963_0066_0FE6A9B15DF7EFA0"/>
of Men, <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Bad, Elect</HI> and <HI>Reprobates, Pe∣nitent,</HI> and <HI>Impenitent,</HI> the Children of God, and the Children of the Devil, so there be but two places, <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell, Joy</HI> and <HI>Pain,</HI> the <HI>Right Hand</HI> and <HI>Left:</HI> And the Rewards shall be ac∣cording, either <HI>Blessed</HI> or <HI>Cursed:</HI> For so St. <HI>John</HI> saith here, <HI>The Elect shall have Eternal Life, but they that are Reprobates, shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></P>
<P>First, concerning the Elect, and those that be chosen in the Lord Jesus; and whose names are written in Heaven: As their Lives differ from the wicked and ungodly, so their E∣state after this life is far different; for they shall be blessed and happy for ever. And if you ask, what is the blessedness that all the e∣lect shall have? I answer with <HI>Paul, The eye never saw it, nor ever entred into the heart of Man to conceive the hundreth part of this happiness,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 9 Yet we may out of the Scripture gather some relish of it, as it is there described un∣to us.</P>
<P>And first this blessed estate of the Godly at the last day, stands in this, that God shall be <HI>all</HI> in <HI>all unto us</HI>: What good things soever the heart of man can wish, that will God be to us. If thou desire <HI>Wealth,</HI> God will be it to thee: If <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Pleasure.</HI> Almighty God will be all in all unto us: Nay, every Child of God shall have as it were a Kingdom, <HI>Come ye blessed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly, In the Kingdom of Heaven there shall be no manner of want; for we shall be free from all sin, and all defects of Body and Soul shall be supplied. And tho' we see God now but in part, yet then we shall behold him face to face, unto our eternal comfort; not as
<PB N="130" REF="002963_0067_0FE6A9BDCE55A1C8"/>
in a Glass darkly; but see and behold him, e∣ven as we are seen and beheld perfectly; and Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, which hath been our Advocate; and the Vision of the Holy Ghost, not like a Dove hovering, but perfectly and directly, <HI>and we shall then for evermore live in his blessed presence, and reign with him for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Then all the Elect shall be like un∣to Jesus Christ: So saith <HI>Paul, He shall change our vile Bodies, and make them like unto his glorious Body.</HI> Christ was most holy, pure, incorrupti∣ble and glorious; even so shall we be: We shall be free from Sin, Satan, Death and Hell, and the Grave. And at the point of Death let us intreat the Lord, that he would be a Fountain of Everlasting Water, to besprinkle our Souls and Hearts, for his Son's sake, Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In Heaven we shall reap <HI>endless Joy, and Eternal Happiness; and shall delight in praising God for ever, so as we shall keep a perpetual Sabbath and Joy in the Service of God for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Oh it is a great happiness to be in the pre∣sence of God: for there is Glory and Honour, and true content indeed: Where we shall have Joy without Sorrow, Day without Night; no Valley of Tears, but a Sion of Glory, &amp; endless comforts. And this shall be for all that fear God, and whose Names shall be found written in the Book of Life.</P>
<P>Oh then, cursed be those men and women, who think and say, it is in vain to serve the Lord: Or as <HI>Pharoah</HI> said, <HI>who is the Lord, that I should fear him?</HI> Then men shall know it is not in vain to serve the Lord; for if we will not be careful to keep a good Conscience, and serve God aright, and so go to Heaven by good Ex∣ample; we then must expect to go to Hell with
<PB N="131" REF="002963_0067_0FE6A9BDCE55A1C8"/>
the wicked for Company; Nay, God will put a difference between them that serve him, and them that serve him not. And this should en∣courage all men to labour to abound in holy Duties, seeing God will reward even the least work of Faith.</P>
<P>If thou give but a Cup of cold Water in the Name of Christ, verily thou shalt not lose thy reward. Tho' our works cannot any way me∣rit, yet he will in Mercy for his Son Christ's sake thus Crown the good Works of his Chil∣dren: For tho' Works do not Merit, yet they are Rwardable. And seeing few shall be saved, let us labour to be of that little Flock, let us above all things seek this Kingdom of God; if thou obtain this, thou art happy and blessed, although thou lose all the World besides; and if thou lose it, thou art miserable &amp; wretched, tho' thou win the whole World. Oh then, what madmen are we, if we never seek for this, or think of Heaven, until we have one foot in the Grave or Hell; let us not think to gain a Kingdom so easily; we cannot go to Heaven on Beds of Down, but we must strive to enter therein, we must take pains for what is got without? And as Life, Joy, Riches, Honour, and Pleasures are sweet; so to en∣joy them for ever, without fear of losing, this is a blessed thing; for it is with them that are in possession of this Kingdom, they be out of all fear to lose it, and shall reign with Christ for evermore.</P>
<P>Thus (in some sort) you may conceive the blessed and most happy estate of all the Elect and faithful Children of the Almigh∣ty, which ought to stir us up to repent, and
<PB N="132" REF="002963_0068_0FE6A9BDE3907A18"/>
turn to God while we have time and space.</P>
<P>But what shall become of the ungodly sin∣ners, of them whose Names are not written in the Book of Life? Alas poor wretched Souls▪ It grieves me to think of them; It would make a man's heart to melt, to think on their woful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> misery; and I quake to speak what shall be∣come of them after this Life. The holy Ghost saith here, <HI>They shall be cast into the Lake of Fire▪</HI> What then shall become of the Swearer, Drun∣kard, <HI>&amp;c. They shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI> And so saith Christ, <HI>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41. This is their end, and their Portion for evermore! Ah miserable wret∣ches! Ah vile and miserable Sinners! It had been better for them they had never been born, or had been rather Toads or Serpents, than Men. For they shall not only be cast out of the glorious and comfortable Presence of Al∣mighty God, and his holy Angels, <HI>But they shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be cast into the Lake of Fire for ever.</HI></P>
<P>This Lake of Fire, into which all impenitent and hard-hearted sinners shall be cast for ever, I have already described to you; and for a Con∣clusion, to put you still in mind of this Lake, this Hell, this Tophet, this place of Torment, which will never have end, I will set down three weighty Points, and that briefly.</P>
<P>First, The extremity of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, The perpetuity of it.</P>
<P>And Thirdly, That it is remediless.</P>
<P>And which well considered, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thinks should make the flinty hearts of sinners to melt, and break to pieces, for fear they come into this Place of Torment, this L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Fire.</P>
<P>And seeing the Spirit of God doth repeat it again &amp; again; that all reprobate sinners shall
<PB N="133" REF="002963_0068_0FE6A9BDE3907A18"/>
be cast into the Lake of Fire, it is to shew, that men little consider of it, they do not tremble at it; and therefore he insists upon it, to teach us that it is a weighty Point to be thought on, to mollisie our hard Hearts. And first, concern∣ing this same Lake of Fire: In that it is named here, <HI>a Lake of Fire</HI>; this noteth to us the ex∣tremity of the Torment, that it is a place of endless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe, and unspeakable pain. The Scrip∣tures afford it sundry Names, to set forth the unspeakable torments thereof. <HI>All wicked and impeniten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sinners shall be cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI> For of all Torments none is so extream as-Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Christ saith, <HI>There shall be weeping, wail¦ing,</HI> &amp;c. And it shall be most hot, and yet most cold, which shews the strangeness of this Fire. Again, <HI>their worm shall never die,</HI> Mark 8 14. That worm which shall gnaw their con∣science. Oh what a woful thing is this for any man or woman to have a worm continually to gnaw their Bowels within, never to let them alone, or give them any rest! Such shall be the misery of the wicked. Again, <HI>Tophet is prepared for the King, he cannot escape, and it is deep and and large, and the burning thereof is Fire and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord as a River of Brimstone shall kindle it,</HI> Isa. 33.33. So the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of God shall be as Bestows to blow it, and as a River of Brimstone to maintain it. By this you may conceive the extremity of this woful Lake of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Fire. But if I had the Tongue of Men and Angels, I could never ex∣press it to the full. For as the Joys of Heaven are unspeakable, so the Torments of Hell are unexpressible: For then the full Wrath of GOD shall seize upon the Reprobates, both
<PB N="134" REF="002963_0069_0FE6A9BF2B3A0E28"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody ond Soul, and that for evermore.</P>
<P>Now to the end you may the better conceive the extremity of it, you must know that the Torments of <HI>Hell</HI> are universal, even in <HI>all</HI> the the parts of the Body, and the faculties of the Soul at once, the Mind, the Will, the Consci∣ence, the Affections, the Head, the Heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all at once shall be tormented. The pains in this Life are for the most part particularly in some part of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy; but in this Fire the Sinner <HI>shall</HI> be tormented in all parts at once, and yet we see that some pains there be, as in Convulsions, or the Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which men would not <HI>willingly</HI> have for a whole World. Alas, what a woful thing <HI>will</HI> this be, to be tormented in <HI>all,</HI> and every particular Member so extream<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t one ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple serve in this point; the Rich Gluton cries out, <HI>Oh, I am tor∣mented in this Flame!</HI> Luke 16.24. The Tor∣ments and heat was so great, that he would have given a whole World, if he had been Master of it, for so much Water as would have stuck upon his Finger, to have cooled his flaming Tongue. Thus you see that the first is most extream and woful, and yet men will not consider it, they mind it not.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t let every one think on the woful and extream pain of this Lake of Fire, let us make that use which our Saviour teacheth, Mat 5.20 <HI>If thy Right Hand or Foot o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lend thee,</HI> that is any thing, never so sweet, or never so pro∣fitable, never so dear or near unto us, <HI>Let us out them off and cast them from us,</HI> that is, let us forego and forsake them <HI>all</HI>; for it is bet∣ter to go lam into Heaven, than whole into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll</HI>; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better to go naked into Heaven,
<PB N="135" REF="002963_0069_0FE6A9BF2B3A0E28"/>
than in costly Apparel into <HI>Hell</HI>: O therefore let carnal men, &amp; ungodly Sinners, that lives in Pleasures and in Sin, know, they <HI>shall</HI> pay full dear for these things, even the loss of their Souls for ever.</P>
<P>Secondly, As the pains of <HI>Hell</HI> are easeless, and most ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ream, so they are endless &amp; per∣petual, no end of them for evermore. So <HI>A∣braham</HI> tells the Rich Glutton; <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u that are there ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> come b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke 16 26 And so saith S. <HI>John,</HI> Rev. 12 <HI>It is a Lake of Fire and Brim∣stone, that bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th for ever:</HI> Also <HI>Mat</HI> 24 41. <HI>Go ye cursed into e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>last<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng fire,</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can never be quen∣ched. Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mned sinners <HI>shall</HI> lie therein many thousand years; yea, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many as there be Stars in Heaven, yet it <HI>shall</HI> never have an end If a man should once every thousand years, take one Spoonful of Water out of the Sea, how many thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and years would be expired, before he should have emptied the same?</P>
<P>On consider this, you that forget God; con∣sider this you which contemn the Word of God prophane the Lord's Sabbath, that make no Conscience at <HI>all</HI> of Drunkenness, but rather count it good Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowship, and brag and boast of it. What Treasure of Plagues the Lord hath reserved for the Damned. On let us think often of this, that these same Torments are both endless and easeless. On, how mad, and what Fools are we, that to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a Season, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndure the Torments of Hell for ever. What will it profit us, to enjoy a little Money, Lands, or Livings here, or to live in all pleasures or delights Sixty or Eighty years, and then to be Tormented in Hell-Fire for evermore? And yet we see that such is the fol∣ly
<PB N="136" REF="002963_0070_0FE6A9BF48F814E0"/>
and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness of many, that they will have these enjoyments here, al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' they pay never so dear for them in the Life to come.</P>
<P>Thirdly, These Torments, as they are end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess and easeless, so they are remediless. This we may beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld in the Rich Glutton in <HI>Hell,</HI> who would have given a World, if he had been ow∣ner of it, and yet for <HI>all</HI> that, he could not have it, it was then denied him. For there is no case nor remedy in <HI>Hell,</HI> no redemption after death; no Silver nor Gold, no Wit nor Policy no Ap∣pealing to another Judge, but he must Lie by it for ever, even in this close Prison, until he hath paid the debt and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>termost Farthing. For if <HI>all</HI> the blessed Saints and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>geis in Heaven <HI>should fall</HI> down at the Feet of Christ, to beg but for one Soul, it could do him no good, Christ would deny them <HI>all,</HI> they must have a Repulse.</P>
<P>O then consider this; this ought to make all men q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to tremble, that in <HI>Hell</HI> is no ease, nor hope of Redemption.</P>
<P>This is that which mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Devil and dam∣ned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirits to Fear and Tremble, and yet it cannot move flinty and stony hearted Sinners once to be afraid. O then, I beseech you, let us think on these things now in the day of mercy, now the remedy is to be had, now we may avoid the fearful misery, now we may es∣cape this woful Torment and Wrath to come.</P>
<P>If we <HI>will</HI> now repent, &amp; leave our sins, and beg Pardon of Almighty God for them, we may escape: But after Death there is no time of Mercy, but only Judgment and Torment, Fire and Brimstone, and the Wrath of God for e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evermore. And therefore let us repent and be∣wail
<PB N="137" REF="002963_0070_0FE6A9BF48F814E0"/>
our sins. while we have Time and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reath to repent; and Live as the servants of God, &amp; not as the slaves of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> any <HI>longer,</HI> &amp; the Gates of <HI>Hell shall</HI> not prevail against us, nor the second Death triumph over us.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Blessed Saviour tells</HI> us, that the <HI>Soul</HI> of the poor Beggar is more worth than many Thou∣sand Worlds. And therefore the Loss of a Soul is greater than the Loss of the whole world. <HI>What benefit were it for a man to win the world, and presently to lose</HI> both Body and Soul.</P>
<P>If a Man should Lose House, Land, Wife, Children, and all that he hath, yet it is nothing in comparison of his Soul; that is a Loss of <HI>all</HI> Losses, to be severed from God and Christ, and to be in <HI>Hell</HI> Torment for ever. O then let us consider the worth of our <HI>Souls,</HI> and what Christ paid for the ransom of them, and learn to prize them above the whole World. But alas, men <HI>will</HI> not so esteem of them: But <HI>will</HI> for one Penny with <HI>Judas,</HI> or an hours pleasure, hazard loss of <HI>Soul</HI> and Body for ever.</P>
<P>Ah poor Man, thou didst never yet know the worth of thy <HI>Soul.</HI> Christ Jesus saith, it is more worth than <HI>all the World.</HI> O let us esteem of it, and value it, and account <HI>all</HI> Riches, Pleasure or Profits as Dung, so that our poor <HI>Souls</HI> may be saved in the Day of our Lord. For a <HI>conclu∣sion</HI> to this purpose; Let us remember the words of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Pet. 3 6. <HI>The World that then was being overflowed with Water perished</HI> Again, <HI>St. Pe∣ter</HI> gives us here a good Lesson, &amp; tells us, <HI>that the Heavens and the Earth which are now by the same Word kept in stone, and reserved unto F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re against the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of un∣godly men,</HI> Verse 9 <HI>The Lord is not slack, but pa∣tient,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="002963_0071_0FE6A9C9B880A538"/>
Verse 10. <HI>But the Day of the LORD will come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, &amp; the Elements shall melt with Fervent Heat, the Earth also, and the Works that are therein shall be burnt up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dis∣solved, what manner of Persons ought ye to be in all Holy Conversation and Godliness looking for, &amp; basting unto the coming of the Day of God, where∣in the Heavens being on Fire shall be dissolved? But we look for new Heavens and a new Earth, according to his Promise, wherein dwelleth Righte∣ousness. Wherefore, Beloved, seeing you look for such things be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless, and ac∣count that the long suffering of the Lord is Salva∣tion. Now the end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober, and watching in prayer,</HI> Luke 21.34. <HI>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drun∣kenness; and Cares of this Life, and so that Day come upon you unawares. For as a Snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man:</HI> For it is he that will say, <HI>A∣rise ye dead and come to Judgment.</HI> Now I have done with the Text, and have shewed you the way to get a good Conscience, and the bene∣fit of it, and likewise the Reward of an evil Conscience, which <HI>is the Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone for ever.</HI> I will not leave you in Horror and Dread in the conclusion of the Text, being the last words of it, but I <HI>will</HI> comfort you with the description of

Heaven, and the Joys thereof, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> re∣lates in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9. <HI>The things which Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI></P>
<P>If the Holy Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> being taken up into Paradise, heard such words which cannot be spoken, and are not possible for a Man to utter; as he testifieth of himself, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13. <HI>How should I be able to express the greatness of these Joys, which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear heard, nor ever entred innto the Heart of Man?</HI></P>
<P>Herein I know Mens Minds <HI>will</HI> run upon needless curiosities, which is no part of my duty to satisfie; and to shew you mine own Imaginations would shew mine own folly. <HI>For Man's Reasons in Spiritual Affairs is altogether fool∣ishness</HI>; But so far as the Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptures doth instruct us, we may be desirous to learn, and also be content, although many things be hid from us. Let it therefore be sufficient, if we have a taste of those Joys, &amp; that it pleaseth God in a mea∣sure to grant us some knowledge of them.</P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> being in his Earthly Paradise, knew not <HI>all</HI> the Secrets thereof: And how <HI>shall</HI> we think to attain the <HI>full</HI> knowledge of the Heavenly Paradise; But seeing God doth grant us the un∣derstanding of these matters in part, he doth it for our good, that seeing those Joys which we can conceive, are surpassing excellent, yet the Heavenly Joys, doth surmount our conceits, ma∣ny degrees further, we might the more be drawn into love with God himself, who hath ordained such Unspeakable, Incomprehensible, &amp; endless Excellencies, for them that love him, and live in his Obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="002963_0072_0FE6A9C9D2250118"/>I <HI>will</HI> first shew you what a blessed Life is, &amp; what they enjoy in Heaven. A blessed Life, is the fruition of God himself, which is our chief∣est good, the most plentiful Fountain and Trea∣sure of <HI>all</HI> goodness in whom <HI>all</HI> Godly Men that die in a true and lively Faith, and invocation of the Son of God, are raised from the dead, and delivered from <HI>all</HI> evil, and united to the Quire of Angels, and Saints in Heaven; and there behold God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; not as in a Glass, or darkly, but Face to Face, and Live free from <HI>all</HI> Calamities, Miseries, Di∣seases, Labours and Griefs; and with ineffable Joy and Comfort, celebrate God's praise to <HI>all</HI> Eternity.

Arm. Also considering our own great un∣worthiness, we might with the Prophet <HI>David</HI> break forth into the Praises of God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.3. and say, <HI>Lord, what is Man that thou takest Knowledge of him, or the Son of Man that thou makest account of him.</HI> Now as the Prophets do stir up the peoples minds to Serve &amp; Ho∣nour God, by setting before them the Tem∣poral Blessings of this Life, &amp; thereby giving them an earnest of greater Blessings to come, so is the Happy Estate of Everlasting Life de∣scribed unto us by such earthly comparisons as our natural capacity can conceive; that we beholding in mind and contemplation, those wonderful Joys which we can conceive; may grow into admiration of those Heavenly and inexpressible excellencies which are altogether past our apprehension, &amp; far beyond our reach and understanding. For as Spiritual Blessings do far surpass Corporal Blessings, so Heavenly Joys do far exceed <HI>all</HI> earthly Glory; yea, and these stately secrets of another Life are so much hidden from Flesh and Blood, that <HI>all</HI> the Learning of the Wise men of the World can come nothing near them; that in this case they may truly say with the Astrologers of King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> Dan 2 11. <HI>It is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can shew before the King, except the Gods, whose dwelling is not with Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>But let us a <HI>little</HI> behold what Flesh and Blood hath set down concerning these Joyes of Heaven. In the <HI>Turkish Alcoran,</HI> thus the Joys of Heaven are set down. Their Prophet promiseth them Garments of Silk, of <HI>all</HI> sorts of Colours, Bracelets of Gold and Amber;
<PB N="142" REF="002963_0073_0FE6A9CC9E2D3840"/>
Parlours and Banqueting Houses upon Floods &amp; Rivers, Vessels of Gold and Silver, Angels, ser∣ving them, bringing Milk and Wine in Gold &amp; Silver; Lodgings Furnished, Cushions, Pillows, and Down Beds, most Beautiful Women to ac∣company them; Gardens and Orchards with delightful Arbours, Fountains, Springs, <HI>all</HI> man∣ner of pleasant Fruits, Rivers of Milk Hony, and Spiced Wine; <HI>all</HI> manner of sweet O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s, Perfumes, and Fragrant Scents; &amp; to be short, whatsoever they <HI>shall</HI> desire to eat.</P>
<P>Thus fleshly People have a fleshly Religion &amp; a fleshly Paradise to inhabit; and sensual men have imagined the Joys of Heaven according to their sensual delight, and yet to them that have and Sense or Reason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot chuse but seem to end <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in a Fable. These Joys are seen in Princes Courts, these Joys are seen in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Kingdom, but the Joys of Heaven are such, that no eye hath ever seen them.</P>
<P>But to leave these deceived <HI>Turks</HI> to their false &amp; feigned Joy, let us consider what others have imagined, not much unlike to this which is ex∣press<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by way of comparison; of a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man's miserable estate, suddenly chang'd into most un∣lookt for Happiness; whereby the Joys of ano∣ther Life may appear by the miseries of this: As if a poor man that was out of his way, wan∣dring alone upon the Mountains, in the midst of a Dark and Tempestuous Night, far from Company, destitute of Mony, beaten with Rain, Terrified with Thunder, Stiff with Cold, almost Famished with Hunger and Thirst, and near brought unto Despair, with a multitude of Mi∣series, should in the twinkling of an Eye be pla∣ced in a Goodly, Large and Rich Palace, Fur∣nished

Beholding the Miseries of this Life, and the Joys of ano∣ther; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this is but an Imagination, and the Wit &amp; Wisdom of Man can devise a great deal more; &amp; yet <HI>all</HI> far inferiour in degree to those true Joys that hereafter <HI>shall</HI> be found. See how the Invention of Men blinded with their natural conceits, run <HI>all</HI> upon outward comforts, and sensual Joys, all for the Body; and as for the Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that is not once remembred. Now from the Devices, Inventions &amp; Imaginations of men, all which come not near the matter; let us come to hear the Revelation of the Scripture, and if any where this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> estate is to be found, we shall read of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Book of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> wherein thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many things be hard and intricate, and passing Mens understanding; yet is this matter lively described after a mea∣sure, and in a sort, under the Name of the City of God, and the Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And strange it is that those matters that neither Eye ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> seen, nor Ear heard, nor ever entred into the Heart of man, should so much be opened and revealed, as there we read.</P>
<P>First then, let us speak concerning the Place, then the State of Joys thereunto appertaining. The Place is Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the City of God, the Land of the Elect, which the Apostle describeth after this manner, <HI>And I John</HI> saith he, <HI>saw the Holy City, New</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>come down from God, out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride trim∣med

But be you glad and rejoyce for ever, in the thing that I shall create For, behold, I create</HI> Jerusalem <HI>a Joy. And I will rejoyce in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and Joy in my people, and the voice of Weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying; and where we shall sing no more the Song of</HI> Babylon, <HI>but the Song of</HI> Sion, <HI>say∣ing, holy, holy, holy Lord God of Heaven</HI> &amp; <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Of this heavenly K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngdom, we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay with <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 84.1, 2. <HI>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! My Soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, my Heart and my Flesh cryeth out for the Living God. Blessed are they that dwell in thy House, they will be still praising thee, for a day in thy Courts is better than a thousand, I had rather be a Door∣keeper in the House of my God, than to dwell in the Tents of the Wicked</HI>; These be the Taber∣nacles of Health and Security: The LORD himself saith thus, <HI>Isa.</HI> 32.18. <HI>My People shall dwell in a peaceable Habitation, and in sure dwel∣lings, and in quiet, resting places.</HI> Of this the Lord saith, <HI>Ezek</HI> 34.14. <HI>I will feed them in a Pasture, and upon the high Mountains of</HI> Israel, <HI>sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l their Fold be; there shall they lie in a good Fold, and in a Fat Pasture shall they feed, upon the Mountains of</HI> Israel, <HI>and shall possess a King∣dom which cannot be shaken.</HI></P>

And how this Heavenly City and new <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> is described, we may read it notably set down in the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> where by di∣vers earthly Similitudes, the Glory thereof is shadowed, setting forth the same by those things which make earthly Cities famous and admira∣ble; as the great compass and height of the Walls and stately Buildings, the gorgeous Fur∣niture thereof, Jewels and precious Stones, plea∣sant Rivers, and the Tees of Life in the midst thereof, no light in the City. But let us behold the order and frame of the City, as we may read in the aforesaid 21 Chapter of <HI>Revelations,</HI> whi∣ther still I refer you. The matter declared is as followeth, beginning at Verse 12. <HI>This City</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="002963_0076_0FE6A9DA0C720900"/>
Jerusalem <HI>had a great Wall, and high and at the Gates twelve Angels, and the Names written which are the twelve Tribes of</HI> Israel. <HI>On the East side there were three Gates, and on the North side three Gates, and on the South side three Gates and on the West Side three Gates; and the Wall of the City had twelve Foundations, and in them the Names of the Lambs twelve Apostles: And the City lay four Square, and the length is as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uge as the breadth of it, and the length an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> breadth and heighth of it are equal: and the building of the Wall of it was of Jasper, and the foundation of the Wall of the City was garnished with all manner of Precious Stones and the twelve Gates were twelve Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, and every Gate is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie Pearl.</HI> &amp; <HI>the Streets of the City are pure Gold as shining Glass.</HI> The Names of the precious Stones are further there recited.</P>
<P>Oh glorious City of God! <HI>Psal.</HI> 46 4. and 36.8. <HI>There is a River, the Streams whereof shall make glad the City of God, the place of the Tabernacles of the most High out of which thou, O Lord, shall make them drink of the River of thy Pleasure</HI></P>
<P>A torrent of Pleasure, a full Cup running o∣ver: in which the Saints of God rejoyce in Christ, cloathed in White, and following the Lamb wheresoever he goeth; and with the An∣gels Sing to the Lord, saying, <HI>Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb,</HI> Amen. <HI>Blessing and Glory, and Wisdom, and Thanks∣giving, and Honour, and Power, and Might be unto our God, for ever and ever.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>You see in these Words, how Glorious the City of God is, the Walls of Jasper, the Foun∣dations of precious Stones, the Gates of Pearls, the Pavement of pure Gold. And if the Walls, Streets, and Gates be such, how much more joy∣ful,
<PB N="149" REF="002963_0076_0FE6A9DA0C720900"/>
comfortable &amp; inexpressible are those things within the City? For we may assure our selves, there are many hidden Treasures, and matters of far more account. Many things spoken of the outward Palace, but those things which are with∣in are unsearchable. According to <HI>Rev</HI> 2.17. <HI>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, save he that receiveth it:</HI> So secret and hidden are the things within the City.</P>
<P>This <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is called a Kingdom, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.29. <HI>Therefore</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>I appoint unto you a King∣dom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table, in my Kingdom, and sat on Thrones judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel.</HI> And to comfort the Godly in all wants, distresses and necessities in this World, Christ saith unto 'em, Luk. 12.32. <HI>Fear not, little Flock, for it is your Fa∣thers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom</HI>: And what greater preferment can they look for?

<P>Gods Kingdom is not shaken, as our earthly Kingdoms are; nor is it to be compared to our Terristrial or Temporary Kingdoms; no, he hath left those Kingdoms to the Sons of Men, as to <HI>David, Solomon, Hezekiah,</HI> and the like. His Kingdom is not made with hands, that is past our Imagination, and contains in it all that can be wished or desired; and therefore did <HI>Abraham</HI> forsake his own native Country, his Kindred, &amp; his Fathers House, to go into, a Land he knew not whither And why did <HI>Moses</HI> forsake <HI>Egypt,</HI> and not only that, but refused to be called the Son of <HI>Pharoah's</HI> Daughter? Why did so many Patriarchs, Prophets, Saints, and holy Men and Women, leave their ancient Houses, Riches, and lay down their Treasures at the Apostles feet, &amp; wander up and down in Wildernesses, and in Mountains, and hide themselves in Dens &amp; Caves of the Earth? Surely for this cause they had re∣spect unto the Recompence of Reward, and that was <HI>Regnum Dei,</HI> the Kingdom of God, this Hea∣venly Mansion, where they desired to be, and were assured they should see the Goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Living, which hath a Crown that never fadeth, and Salvation that ne∣ver endeth; an inheritance immortal, &amp; a Ha∣bitation perpetual. <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where God would be worshipped, and in which King <HI>Solomon</HI> built the Temple, seated in that place, which we now call the Holy Land, was in times past so famous, that all Nations had recourse thither? Both be∣cause of God's Worship and Service performed
<PB N="151" REF="002963_0077_0FE6A9DB4A8106A0"/>
there, and his manifold gracious Blessings pour∣ed thereon; and therefore the Kingdom of Hea∣ven is compared to this, and called the new <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> Likewise also <HI>Canaan,</HI> that plentiful Land, which flowed with Milk and Hony, which was the Land that was promised to the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> is compared to this Heavenly Habitation, But as many died short of it, and never entred into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> some for Murmuring, some for Wheredom, some for Idolatry, some for one offence, some for another; so although we hear of the Joys of Heaven, and of this new City, and many would enter therein; yet for their manifold offences in this time of their life and tryal, many are debarred from thence, and few are made the Citizens of Heaven; therefore if we expect to come to this place of Happiness, we must first be Reconciled to God by true Re∣pentance; we must come with Jesus Christ in our hearts by Faith, and plead his Merits, Death and Passion and so enter into his Joy.</P>
<P>Thus much for the place, now for the Com∣modities.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Heavenly Joys of the Soul</HEAD>
<P>THE Commodities or Joys which belong to this Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> first concern the Soul, which is the principal part of Man.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Body; for the Body being joyned to the Soul, shall be partaker of this in∣estimable and everlasting happiness, that in Bo∣dy and Soul, the whole man may receive his full perfection, as he was at first created perfect. And as it is the chiefest delight of the Godly to serve God especially in the Church, and in the Congregation, but in this Celestial <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="002963_0078_0FE6A9DB629AAC50"/>
there shall be no Temple, no Church. <HI>And I saw no Temple therein</HI> How then? Why the Presence of God himself shall be unto them in∣stead of a Temple and Church. For the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it; and therefore why should men be so loth to go into this Joy, which is so unspeakable? And as St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> saith, where we shall have in that Celestial Mansion, no Joy by measure, as in a Glass or Cup, no, but a River of Joy &amp; Com∣fort; we shall be overcome with Joy; &amp; this Joy is as it were wings to the Soul to fly thro' this Valley of Misery and Adversity; for as long as the Soul is in the Body, it is but as in a Prison, like a Bird in a Cage, not having her u∣sual Liberty.</P>
<P>Thus in the Presence of God shall be all happiness, <HI>and at his Right Hand there are Pleasures for evermore.</HI> And it is said the Four and Twen∣ty Elders fell down before him that sat on the Throne, and worshipped him that liveth for e∣vermore, and cast their Crowns before the Throne, So shall the Saints in Heaven con∣tinually sing forth God's Praises, <HI>Rev</HI> 7 4 <HI>And the Hundred Forty and Four Thousand, which had the Name of God in their Foreheads, do sing a new song before the Throne, and to man could learn that Song, but the Hundred Forty and Four Thousand which were redeemed from the Earth.

our God for evermore.</HI> Now shall the Mind, Heart, Thought, and Imagination of those that are thus blessed, be filled with abundance of Spiritual comfort. For now we see as St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, as it were in a Glass: But there we <HI>shall</HI> see Face to Face, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.4. Then <HI>shall</HI> all terrour and darkness of Ignorance be taken away; then <HI>shall</HI> we not desire as now we do in this Life, to see God, as the Prophet <HI>David</HI> speaketh, <HI>My Soul thirsteth after thee, like as the Hart desireth the Water Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oks, so longeth my Soul after thee, O God, yea even for the living God; when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?</HI> At that time shall our desire be fully satisfied; and that which was denied the Prophet <HI>Moses, to see the Glory of God in this Life,</HI> shall then be∣granted to every one that there shall be placed.</P>
<P>Then grief of mind, and sorrow of heart <HI>shall</HI> be utterly removed; no Weeping, no Mourning, no Lamentation to be heard through∣out that Holy Mountain. <HI>Behold,</HI> saith the Prophet in the Person of God, <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.14. <HI>My Servant shall sing for Joy of heart: I will joy in my People, and the voice of crying,</HI> Rev. 21.4 <HI>For God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more sorrow, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed a∣way.</HI> That is, those things which we suffered in this Life shall not molest us any more.

<P>THE Commodities and Priviledges of the Body, also thus united to the Soul <HI>shall</HI> be many: And first to begin with that which I find set down in the Text, <HI>And the City had no need of the Sun, or of the Moon to shine on it:</HI> that is, <HI>there shall be seen no Earthly want.</HI> For, what a great temporal blessing is the heat of

Most comfortable to Man &amp; Beast, which bringeth forth the Fruits of the Earth for Man's Food and without which <HI>all</HI> things seem to be sad and lowering, but then shall we not need this benefit; for the presence of God shall be more comfortable, and the Glo∣ry of God <HI>shall</HI> supply the want of the Sun and Moon.</P>
<P>All things then <HI>shall</HI> be ministred unto us abundantly, that we <HI>shall</HI> not once think of any want, whether it be food or cloathing, or any comfort of this Life whatsoever, as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> doth worthily express it, <HI>Chap.</HI> 49 10. <HI>They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat not Sun smite them, for he that hath mer∣cy on them shall lead them even by the Springs of Waters.</HI></P>

nothing so bitter or sharp in this Life, but will be sweetned in contemplation of the Joyes of Heaven, &amp; of eternal Life; for in Heaven there is nither Death, nor Mourning, Weariness nor Weakness, Famine nor Thirst, Corruption nor Want, nor Sadness at all; so as we may rather be able to say, <HI>What is not there,</HI> than, <HI>What is there?</HI> As it is written, <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love and fear him.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore let no man that hath lived upright∣ly, fear to die, or doubt of the Joys of Heaven; for as we are <HI>all</HI> born, so we must <HI>all</HI> die: And shall any man think to get that by Favour, which God only hath himself by Nature, Immortality? No, we must change this Life, and for this mortal Habit, put on immortal Habit, which never fadeth.</P>
<P>The Godly in this Life are as Warriours, then they shall come to their own possession; now they are in the Skirmish, then they shall be crown∣ed Conquerors; now they are in the Tempestu∣ous Sea, then shall they be in the quiet Haven; now in the Heat of the Day, then shall they be in the rest of the Evening.

follow them</HI>: And what joy <HI>will</HI> thy Soul receive in that day, when we shall be presented before so honourable and infinite a multitude, before the seat and Majesty of the holy &amp; blessed Tri∣nity, with recital &amp; declaration of all the good works and Travels suffered for the love and ser∣vice of God, when there shall be laid down in that honourable Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ory, all thy Vertuous Deeds, <HI>all</HI> the Labour thou hast taken in thy cal∣ling, <HI>all</HI> thy Alms and Prayers, <HI>all</HI> thy Fasting, <HI>all</HI> thy Innocency of Life, <HI>all</HI> thy Patience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Injuries, <HI>all</HI> thy Constancy in Adversities; and for their further comfort, and in a manner won∣derful astonishment; as the wicked shall be vex∣ed with horrible fear, when they shall see the righteous stand in great b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldness, and they shall curse their foolishness and madness, for tormen∣ting such unjustly whom they thought nothing worthy of honour, &amp; yet now see them amongst the Saints of God. <HI>So shall the righteous in their place go forth, and look upon the carca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses of the men that have transg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed God's Will and holy Law,</HI> Isai. 65.14. And looking back upon the dangers which they have passed, and wherein other men are yet in hazard, their joy shall be so much the more en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eased; for they shall evidently see how infinite times they were ready to perish in this mortal life, if God had not held his special hand over them. They shall see the dangers wherein other men are plunged, and the death and damnation that many of their friends and acquaintance have faln into; the eternal pains of Hell is incurred by many that used to laugh and be merry with them in the World, when as they shall shine as Stars which have converted many unto God, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11. As on the contrary,
<PB N="160" REF="002963_0082_0FE6A9E6F6731640"/>
they tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by evil example &amp; manifo'd offences have been the cause of the downfal of many, shall suffer intolerable grief.</P>
<P>In earth no joy, or comfort so surpassing, strange and wonderful, but <HI>will</HI> breed a satiety, and we shall after a while wax weary thereof, either desiring a greater, or else longing after variety; for mans Nature is given to nothing so much as to newness and novelty. But behold the joys of this new <HI>Jerusalem</HI> shall be so diverse, so strange and incredible, that we shall never be satisfied therewith. We see in <HI>Rev</HI> 21. <HI>The Tree of Life bears twelve manner of Fruits, and gave fruit every month; twelve manner of Fruits.</HI> There is the diversity of their joy; giving fruits every month, there is the continual change still pleasing thy mind with variety, &amp; ravishing thy senses with infinite delight.</P>
<P>And this may make us more eager after those joys, because we shall not be long without 'em. For the time of this Life is but short, and the time of thy Tryal in this World, is but in a manner a moment. If our time here should be a thousand years, what is it to one day there which hath no night; which, be it that it hath a Sun rising, yet it shall never set; an entrance and a beginning there is unto those Joys, but the terms and date thereof cannot be told. And as the Torments of <HI>Hell,</HI> already spoken of, are endless; so are the Joys of Heaven beyond <HI>all</HI> time; as they are remediless (for out of Hell, there is no redemption) so are these joys with∣out <HI>all</HI> change or alteration; as they are com∣fortless, so these exceed in <HI>all</HI> manner of com∣forts; all without end, without number, with∣out measure.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="002963_0082_0FE6A9E6F6731640"/>Thus have I shewed you the Joys of the King∣dom of Heaven, in part, but their fulness I cannot utter, nor you conceive, we can only guess at them: But that which I have already spoken is sufficient, for the satisfying of our in∣infinite desires, edification, comfort and instruc∣tion. And if I should fill your Heads, with my own devices and Imaginations, I should but delude you. Again, be not desirous to know more than is fit and convenient: For when we have spoken <HI>all,</HI> or the learnedest in the World expressed <HI>all,</HI> yet none can fully utter the truth of these Joys. For if no Eye hath ever seen them, or Heart of Man can conceive them, how is it possible for me to declare them? But that which we do know, let it be instructive, and let us leave off to search where God will give no understanding. Hidden they are &amp; unknown that we might the more earnestly desire them, for known things grow out of love.</P>
<P>The consideration of these Joys already reci∣ted, may be sufficient to establish and confirm us that there be not in any of us an unfaithful Heart, to depart from the Living God. And who would deprive himself of those Joyes, if they were no other, but such as our own minds might imagine, or our own hearts conceive? In this case, let us be content there to make a stop where Gods Word hath set a full point. And blessed be God, who to encourage us in a way of Godliness, hath giveh us a taste of these unutterable Joys, though it be but as it were under a Veil</P>
<P>Now to shew you all these Joys and not apply them, seemeth altogether without use, and life. The profitable instructions therefore that hence
<PB N="162" REF="002963_0083_0FE6A9F22D7690A8"/>
may arise, are more than I can utter; yet give me leave to recite some, and be not uneasie tho' I stay you a little longer, for to hear the dis∣course of those things which pertain to the Kingdom of Heaven. I my self which have searched more perhaps than any of you, should be at a loss.</P>
<P><HI>Suppose we are now busie in the Field at Harvest, unmindful to come even to our own Houses, and surely this is a far better Harvest, and a better Grain and Commodity than we can gather in. When it pleased God I wrote this for your good, it was with comfort; and therefore I doubt not but that you that hear it, hear it also with comfort.</HI></P>
<P>The first instruction for our use may be this, to learn to grow out of love with the present World, and with the transitory Plea∣sure and Profits of the same; so <HI>that</HI> we may prepare our journey to our long &amp; wish∣ed home; and to those Houses and Heavenly Habitations, whose Leases <HI>shall</HI> never expire; to our Heavenly <HI>Canaan</HI>; and to this beautiful new <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Howbeit for the most part we are so bewitched with the glistering Joys of this present fading World, <HI>that</HI> no exhor∣tation or perswasion <HI>will</HI> lightly prevail to withdraw our minds from thence; which thing may lively be set forth to your view, by reci∣ting of a parable of the custom of a certain Common-wealth, People and Nation, which were wont to chuse their King from amongst the poorest sort of people to advance him to great honour, wealth and pleasure for a time.</P>
<P><HI>But after a while when they were weary of him, their custom was to dispoil him of all his felicity;
<PB N="163" REF="002963_0083_0FE6A9F22D7690A8"/>
yea, the very cloaths of his Back, and banish him na∣ked into an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a far Country, where bringing no∣thing with him, he lived in great misery and slavery forever. Which practice one King considering (for all other though they knew it yet through negligence and pleasures of their present felicity, minded it not) took care to prevent this misery, which was by this means: He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every day great sums of money from his Su∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ties and idle expenses and secretly made over before hand a great Treasure into that Island, whereun∣to he was in danger da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to be sent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when the time came, that indeed they deposed him from his Kingdom, and turned him away naked as they had done others before, he went to that Island with joy and confidence where his Treasure lay, and was re∣ceived with great Triumph, and placed presently in greater glory than he was before.</HI></P>
<P>This City or Common-wealth, is this present World, which advanceth to Authority poor men, <HI>that</HI> is, such as come naked into this World; &amp; on a sudden, when they look least for it, it pulls them down again, and turns them naked into their Graves, and so sendeth them into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World; where bringing no Treasure with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are like to find <HI>little</HI> Favour, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ternal Misery.</P>
<P>The wise King <HI>that</HI> prevents this calamity, is every one which in this life; according to the Counsel of Christ, doth seek to lay up Treasure in Heaven against the Day of their Death, when they must be banished hence naked, as all the Princes of <HI>that</HI> City were. At which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mre if
<PB N="164" REF="002963_0084_0FE6A9F248BA4C78"/>
their good deeds follow them as God promises, then <HI>shall</HI> they be happy men, &amp; placed in much more Glory than ever this World was able to give them. But if they come without Oyl in their Lamps, then there is nothing for them to expect than this, <HI>I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of Money is not so much our good deeds, as the forgiveness of our manifold offen∣ces, the amendment of our sinful Lives, the Godly and Religious care of the Life to come. That which we are so greatly in love withal, the Apostle counsels us against, <HI>Love not the World neither the things that are in the World,</HI> 1 Joh 2. He' addeth the Reason <HI>because the World passes away.</HI> But he <HI>that</HI> doth the <HI>Will</HI> of God abideth for e∣ver. Heaven is not in this Life, and we must look to be weaned from this World if we ever look to attain it.</P>
<P>The Joys of Heaven, and the desire of the World, are quite contrary; worldly pleasures hinder us from mounting up so high. And here∣in for the most part we may be resembled to the Grashopper which is born and bred, liveth and dyeth in the same ground.</P>
<P>This Grashopper hath wings, and hoppeth up a little, but presently falleth down again: So many of us have often good motions unto God∣liness, and the Life to come, and again all is gone in a moment, and we return to our old affections to this World, as though all our Por∣tion were only in this Life.</P>
<P>The Fowls that feed grosly, never flie high,
<PB N="165" REF="002963_0084_0FE6A9F248BA4C78"/>
and they which feed their hearts with things be low, cannot have their affections in Heaven; the joys of Heaven being so excellent, and wonder∣ful, that they might remove our heavy, lumpish &amp; grovelling desire after this World. The care∣less, earthly and worldly mind, hath no sight nor sense, nor feeling of these Joys. But as the Ox is fatted in the pasture, and the Bird singeth sweetly, and feedeth without fear, and suddenly the one is driven to the Slaughter, and the other is taken in the snare; so they that be Worldly minded are lulled asleep in security, until the time that Death striketh with his dart, and end∣less destruction overwhelm them. But where is the Man or Woman which can say with the A∣postle, <HI>I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is best of all. For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a Country,</HI> Heb. 11.16. <HI>Desiring a better Country than is to be found in this World</HI>; that is, <HI>a Heavenly Country, and for them hath God prepared a City,</HI> Heb. 13.14. <HI>For here we have no continuing City, no continuing Habi∣tation.</HI> Let us therefore seek this new Habitation to come, which is of longer continuance, &amp; free from all miseries. The next fruit is that the remembrance of these Joys teacheth us patience in afflictions, troubles and distresses. And if we desire to attain this heavenly place, we must forsake this earthly Tabernacle, and while we live here on Earth, we must pass thro' affliction, and be carried into Heaven by a fiery Chariot, that our Earthly minds may be purged; that is, the black line of our sins which must be pur∣ged both out of our mind and out of our hearts. Christ he was not free from Affliction, for he cried out, <HI>My God, my God; why hast thou forsaken
<PB N="166" REF="002963_0085_0FE6A9F579D0FAC8"/>
me?</HI> We must go first to Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> before we can come to Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> that is, from a Cross to a Crown, from Earth to Heaven: Our Graves are but as Folds, which Death brings us into, and keeps our Bodies till the Morning Sun of our Resurrection shall appear; which is the Day of our general Resurrection; For Death is but a Door of Entrance to a Crown of Glory, which shall never be taken from us. For how troublesome soever this Life is here, yet there shall <HI>all</HI> troubles, griefs, and wrongs be abundantly recompenced, and the Apostle speaketh truly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 18.8. <HI>The Afflictions of this present time, are not worthy of the Glory which shall he shewed unto us.</HI> In the 126 Psal. ver. 5. <HI>They that sow in tears,</HI> saith the Psalmist, <HI>shall reap in Joy. And he that</HI> now <HI>goeth on his way weeping, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing precious seed, shall doubtless come and bring his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaves with him.</HI> Wo be to you, saith Christ, that now laugh for you shall weep, and therefore happy shall they be in another World, who have in good cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e suffered wrongs, committing themselves to God, This time of heavenly joys is compared unto Harvest: And what care doth every one take to provide good and choice Seed, that their Harvest may prove good? Thy Seed is thy thoughts, thy Words, thy Deeds and Conversa∣tion. Therefore let me exhort you, as the A∣postle doth, <HI>Gal. 5.7. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap: for he that soweth to the Flesh, shall of the Flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spi∣rit, shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting.</HI> Look now we sow, so shall we reap: such as our seed is, such also shall be our Harvest. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te of this our Life is but short, but the Re∣membrance
<PB N="167" REF="002963_0085_0FE6A9F579D0FAC8"/>
of a Life <HI>well</HI> led, shall be comfor∣table for ever, and this shall for ever and ever be an endless harvest, still gathering, still in∣creasing, never diminishing.</P>
<P>The last thing in the aforesaid 21 Chapter of <HI>Rev.</HI> is, that there shall enter in this heavenly <HI>Jerusalem</HI> no unclean thing. And as the Pro∣phesie of <HI>Zachariah</HI> 14.21. <HI>In that day there shall be no more the Canaanites</HI> in the House of the Lord of Hosts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canaanites</HI> were a lewd people, and for the same were driven out of the Land; and if they were not worthy to dwell on Earth, much less shall they be worthy to be received into Heaven. <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly beloved,</HI> saith the Apostle St. <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 Epist. 2.11▪ <HI>Abstain from fleshly Lusts, bridle them, keep them under, for they war against the Soul,</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l 3.1. <HI>If then ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the Right Hand of God.

<P>And God grant us this Wedding Garment of holiness, that we may go in with the Bride∣groom; for we know what befel him that wanted it, Phil 2.12. <HI>Let us work our own Salva∣tion with fear and trembling</HI>; being desirous to receive a Kingdom, which cannot be shaken.

may please him with Reverence &amp; Godly Fear. And seeing we have precious Promises, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. And that more sure than the Heaven &amp; the Earth, 2 Cor 7 1 <HI>Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting ho∣liness in the fear of God.

Let not my last exhortation be forgotten a∣mong you, <HI>Enter in at the strait Gate</HI>; for it is the wide Gate, and broad way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.

<P>To add to these, one of the greatest Joyes of <HI>all,</HI> is God's mercy, whereof we have a sweet taste in this Life: For were it not for that, none at <HI>all</HI> should enter into <HI>that</HI> place where those joys are to be found. For our first Parents, by God's just anger, according to their desert, were cast out of Paradise, and an Angel set with a Sword drawn to keep the way, <HI>that</HI> no flesh should return thither; so the only gate to lead us in again is God's mercy: Whereof as the Godly and most righ∣teous <HI>that</HI> are, stand in great need, so let none of us <HI>all</HI> ever abuse God's mercy, least we miss of the same. This mercy is called the <HI>rich Mercy</HI> of God; for no Treasure is comparable unto it: And as it passeth all understanding, so cannot the deepest reach of men conceive any part of the depth or heighth thereof; the compass, the largeness, the wideness, &amp; breadth

of it is such, that it cannot be measured; and therefore it may <HI>well</HI> be called, as indeed it is, both infinite and incomprehensible. And be∣cause no tongue of man can speak it, let Angels bring the message, as we read, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14. <HI>Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, Good Will towar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s men.</HI> The Lord of his goodness di∣rect our steps to his Throne of mercy; and cloath us with this Garment of mercy; and the Lord this day set his Print and Seal upon you.</P>
<P>Last of all, for a conclusion, and for admoni∣tion. In brief, I will shew you the right way of dying <HI>well</HI>; and the comfort of it, which in the end brings <HI>all</HI> this joy and happiness. First, by Virtue of Christ's Death, Death ceaseth to be any more a terror or a plague, but it's made a blessing, and a passage between this and Eter∣nal Life. Christ is the Key of our Graves, and hath opened the Kingdom of Heaven to <HI>all</HI> Be∣lievers. The day of death is only terrible, when it is joyned with the apprehension of GOD's Wrath, and we are not defended with the Shield of Faith. When we die, we should rejoyce in the Lord, for the corruption of our nature is quite abolished, and our Sanctification is there accomplished. By death our present miseries are removed, and the future prevented. What happiness is it to see the glory of God's Majesty, face to face, to live and abide with God, &amp; the Holy and Blessed Angels for ever? And when we are joyned to Christ by the bond of the Spi∣rit in our life time, we shall eternally remain with him in unutterable felicity. Likewise be∣ing once certainly assured in conscience of our being in Christ let Death come when it <HI>will,</HI> we
<PB N="170" REF="002963_0087_0FE6AA00759894C0"/>
shall yet remain in the covenant, and shall be re-united with him, and taken up to Everlasting Life: And whether we wake or sleep, or whate∣ver we do, let us alway bear in mind the end of our Life; and that we continually hear the found of the Trumpet, <HI>Arise ye Dead, and come to Judgment</HI>; knowing that the power of Death lies in our sin; &amp; therefore let us use all g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od means, that our sins may be removed and par∣doned. And to weaken the force of Death, the best way is to humble our selves, repent us of our sins, amend our lives, &amp; to trust and relie upon the Mercies of God, <HI>that</HI> we may com∣fortably say with St. <HI>Paul, I live not, but Christ lives in me,</HI> which we must find by the Tes∣timony of our sanctified conscience, <HI>that Christ</HI> my Redeemer by his Spirit, governs according to his Holy Will. O how late is that hour for a man to begin to live <HI>well</HI> when he must of necessity die, and depart out of this Life? <HI>Doth any man think that God will be co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent, that we should lay our old and rollen bodies upon his Altar, when we have lived all our youthful time in our own delights? No sure, or do we think that when we have spent all our time and study to got Wealth and Honour, and then in our old age when we can do nothing else, begin to pray and serve God? This will be a great cause, when we examine our lives, how we have mispent it to fear Death. What was the reason that Christ loved his Disciple</HI> John <HI>better than the rest? because he came to him in his youth, while he was young and lusty.</HI> In∣deed God will not be our Staff in our Age, if we do not serve him in our youth. <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> the wisest King that ever lived, gives

this instruction to <HI>all</HI> posterity: <HI>Remember</HI> (saith he) <HI>thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</HI> For our Life is but a perpetual motion, even from the Cradle to the Sepulchre: Nor doth our sleep hinder us in this our Journey: We must <HI>still</HI> remember our end, &amp; have an eye upon Death, <HI>that</HI> hath an eye upon us at <HI>all</HI> times. We must not come into the World as <HI>Cato</HI> did in the Theatre, <HI>only to go out of it again:</HI> Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must not think <HI>that</HI> God put <HI>Adam</HI> into the Garden to eat the Fruit, and take his pleasure, and to spend his time in idleness; no, he put him into it to dress it, and look t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; for, saith God, <HI>Thou shall get thy Laving with the sweat of thy brows.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is the World made for man, as the Sea was for the <HI>Levia∣tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to take his pleasure and pastime in: No, we must labour to run in God's Laws and Commandments, which will bring rest to our Souls He can never shoot well, that hath not his eye still upon the mark or white; so no more can a man live well, that hath not his mind upon the day of his Death. It is a comfort of <HI>all</HI> comforts, especially to a godly man, to have hope and faith, to believe he shall rise again from the grave; and so their eyes to see those Friends again, which Death hath separated; nor must we think that we shall arise voluntarily, but the sound of the Trumpet shall be the Voice, which is meant, the Voice of Christ by his Ministers the An∣gels. For he shall only speak the Word as a Judge doth on Earth, appoint a Summons. All must appear. For this day of Jubilee there shall be no more New Moons, as the Trum∣pets were used to be blown at, as the Pro∣phet

<HI>David</HI> speaks in the 61 Psal. <HI>No, but we shall have a new Earth, and a new Heaven, where dwelleth all Righteousness,</HI> 2 Pet. 3 13. <HI>When this Trumpet shall blow, it shall be both loud and shrill: no ear but shall hear the sound; the dampness of the Earth shall not hinder it, nor the depth of the Grace excuse us; No place, though never so remote, shall hinder this sound: For it shall be universal, and in every corner of the Earth shall this Trumpet be heard.</HI> For we must remember, <HI>that</HI> our bodies when they are in the Earth, is but like a sowing of seed; for we shall rise again The Lord calls to man by his Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> saying, <HI>Earth, Earth, Earth, Hear the word of the Lord</HI>: To put him in mind that he is but Earth: For at the first, Earth we were, and still we are Earth, and Earth we shall be again, when God but speaks the word First, an ordinary change by Death we must have. Secondly, an extraordinary change at this day by the power of God; for the Earth &amp; the Heaven shall be changed by Fire. Death is but a change, our Bodies shall be changed; for the Text saith, <HI>We shall all be changed. Paul</HI> meant himself too: We shall be changed saith he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This substance of ours shall be altered at the last day, though not with <HI>that</HI> formality as ours are, to die and then be put in a Coffin, &amp; then into a Grave. Not by such degrees; but we shall be suddenly changed, even in the twinkling of an eye; for Death is but the first step to Earth, and then to Glory. We shall have like∣wise a twofold Resurrection: First of our Bo∣dies from the Grave. And Secondly, of our Souls from Sin. <HI>Abraham,</HI> he confessed, &amp; said, <HI>O Lord, give me but leave to speak this once, who am dust and ashes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="002963_0088_0FE6AA00911E1480"/>First then, seeing we are but as the Dust of the Earth, the Earth must then obey when God <HI>calls,</HI> and render up her dead. So likewise the Fire obeyed Gods command, not to hurt the three Children which was put into the Fiery Furnace, and yet had power to burn and destroy those that put them into it: So likewise the Sea obey∣ed God's command, and was a Wall to the chil∣dren of <HI>Israel,</HI> and gave them then a miraculous and dry passage. So the Earth and the Sea must obey God's Voice at the last day, and yield and give up their dead: <HI>The earth shall give up her dead.</HI> And yet the Earth devoured some, as it did at God's command, when <HI>Corah, Dathan,</HI> and his company was swallowed up quick, so at the last day of Account, God shall only say the word, &amp; all his Creatures must obey it; for the dew of Heaven is as the dew of Herbs.

It is a Divine Work, and is past our understanding; therefore let us rather ad∣mire God's infinite Wisdom and Goodness, than be too nice and curious to search into them.

<P>And let <HI>all</HI> men remember this, <HI>that</HI> we shall Rise again, and stand upon the Earth: And then God will Reward a sinner in that day, if he die without Repentance, as if the sinner had but just committed the acts of sin at the same time. <HI>Paul</HI> will be found, although not preaching as he did on earth, yet in the condition he died; and we with the same sins, or with the same Righteous∣ness, as we live or die in; for our Consciences <HI>will</HI> then accuse us, our Memories witness against us, and our Reason <HI>will</HI> be our Judges at this day.

For indeed we are not by Nature able to bear the pangs of Death <HI>well,</HI> until we be Schooled and instructed by sundry Tryals and Exercise in this Life.

but a passage to a better Life. I would have every Christian man and woman upon their sick beds to look for Death, and take it patiently &amp; willingly: My first reason is, because the Death of every Member of Christ is foreseen and or∣dained by the special Decree and Providence of God, yea the very circumstances thereof. Se∣condly, Then God's promise, <HI>Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labours, and their Works follow them,</HI> Rev. 14.13.

Then Fourthly and Lastly, God hath promised his special and blessed presence to the sick and dying that are his, as we may read, Isa. 43.2. Where he declares himself t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, <HI>When thou passeth through the Waters, they shall not o∣verflow thee; when thou walkest through the Fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flames kin∣dle upon thee: For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel, thy Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Now to die in Faith, is when a man in time of his Death, with <HI>all</HI> his heart relies wholly on God's special love and mercy in his Son Jesus Christ. So did the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> when he was greatly distressed, he enco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged himself in the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, with a great deal of Faith, say∣ing, <HI>Remember the Word unto thy Servant, upon which thou hast promised and caused me to hope.

As</HI> Moses <HI>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up</HI>: That is, when he feels Death to come upon him; he then
<PB N="181" REF="002963_0092_0FE6AA10F3D4F778"/>
must fix his eye of Faith on Christ exalted on the Gross, and also crucified for Eternal Life.</P>
<P>The very sighs, sobs and groans of a repen∣tant and a believing heart, are Prayers before God as effectual, as if they were uttered by V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Intercession; Such as, <HI>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the Humble, thou wilt prepare their hearts, thou wilt incline thine ear.

Yet far happier than all these, are the joys of Heaven, and surely so is the state and condition of every penitent man, which can before he die, make his peace with God; for then shall he be free from all earthly trouble this World brings upon him, for while he lives here, he lives but in a Vale of misery, and in a Vale of Tears, tost to and fro with every storm and wind: But he is happy, who can say with <HI>Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace.</HI> And with <HI>Thomas</HI> can say, <HI>my Lord, &amp; my God.</HI> Then will our Saviour meet us, saying, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, receive the Crown▪ Receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the be∣ginning of the World.</HI> And no sooner art thou come into Paradise, this Heavenly Mansion, this place of everlasting joy and happiness; but in∣stead of sorrow, we shall have joy, instead of trouble and affliction, peace and rest for our souls; and for our company, we shall have

Our Saviour performing his promise in giving us a Kingdom; at which meeting the Angels shall sing, the Blessed Saints rejoyce all Harps warble, all Hands clap for joy, and our poor Souls ravisht with delight; and if this be the case and state of all penitent and true Believers, who will not say, <HI>Hasten thy Coming, O Lord, Come Lord Jesus, Come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>O let us present to the view of our Souls, the blessed &amp; happy condition of the Life to come: And this will stir us up to every good &amp; Holy Duty; and comfort and cherish us in all condi∣tions and estates whatsoever, while we live in this sinful World, and amongst this untoward Generation. What will a man care for crosses, lesses, and disgrace in the World, that thinks of an Heavenly Kingdom! What will a man care for ill usage in his Pilgrimage of this earthly Tabernacle, when he knows he shall be a King at home? we are all (in this time of our ab∣sence from God) but even strangers &amp; pilgrims upon Earth: Here in this Life we must suffer Indignities, Reproaches, Scoffs, may, what not? yet all of these are for our good, if we can en∣dure it with patience, and overcome these Temp∣tations with joy and alacrity; for in the end there is comfort, we shall have a better Estate to come; yea, in the highest Heavens, and all this in the mean time is nothing but a fitting &amp; preparing us to the Heavenly Kingdom, which holy <HI>David</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red to be but a Door-keeper of, rather than to dwell in the Tents of <HI>Kedar:</HI> (that is amongst ungodly people:) Let this

be our hope and comfort, howsoever we fare in this Life, that we have here but a little time to spend, and it must not be long e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re we inherit the Kingdom of Glory: Alas, The afflictions of this Life are not worthy to be compared to the Glory hereafter, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.18. And therefore good old <HI>Ignatius</HI> in a burning Zeal durst say, <HI>Come Fire, Gallows, Breaking of my Body; Quitering of my Members, Crushing of my Body; all the torments of the Devil, let them come upon me, so I may enjoy this Treasure of Heaven.</HI> So St <HI>Paul, He counted all things but dress in comparison of Christ; I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</HI> saith he: And well might he say it, that knew what a change would be one day; for never was cold shade so plea∣sant in hot Summer, never was easie Bed so de∣lightful after Labour, as shall be the rest of Heaven to an afflicted Soul, coming thither out of this Valley of Tears: On then; What Ser∣vice should we do? What pains should we suf∣fer and take, to attain this Rest? were it to run through Fire and Water;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were it (as St. <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> said) to suffer every day new torments; yea the torments of Hell, yet should we be con∣tent to abide it.

<P>Obedience, saith a Holy Father, is one of the first steps to Heaven; and to die in obedience, is to be willing and ready to go out of the World when God calls us. As in <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 7.8. It is thus said, <HI>None of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself: For whether we live, we live unto the

We must not fear Death at all, and my reasons are these. First, In all our care we have occasion to shew our Obedience to God Almighty. Secondly, All future sin is prevented by Death, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, that the last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death. That shews us, that Death hath no more power over our Bodies, and that our Bo∣dies and Souls shall be united together again, &amp; receive a reward according to the deeds we have done in the flesh. Thirdly, our Bodies are bro't to a better and far more happy place and blessed Estate, where we are free from all future mise∣ries, and cease to be any more either active or passive in sin. Fourthly, It gives a Soul a free passage to the Caelestial Glory, where we shall have the vision and fruition of God the Father, who was our Creator; the Society of God the Son, who hath been our Redeemer, and Advo∣cate, the Company of God the Holy Ghost, who hath Sanctified us.

<PB N="1" REF="002963_0099_0FE6AA30E8763B08"/>
Order of Placing this Book, the Title of it, the Subject, and the matter therein contained.</P>
<P>First, Touching the Order of placing this Book, wherein <HI>Solomon</HI> labours to build up the Spiritual Temple of the Soul: It is the same he hath observed in building the material Tem∣ple, where he framed three Courts; the outmost for the common People, the second for the Priests and Levites; and last of all the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> the Holiest of Holies, only for the High Priest to enter in at, and that but once a Year. Even so in this Spiritual Temple of Mans Soul he hath likewise framed three Courts: First an outward Court, which is his Book of <HI>Pro∣verbs,</HI> where all sorts and degrees of men what∣soever are taught and instructed a civil course of manners: Next to that, he hath a second Court, which is his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, leading Men on further in the way of Godliness, and Christian Piety: And last of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he hath a <HI>Sanctum Sancto∣rum,</HI> which is the <HI>Canticles,</HI> where not every one, but only those that delight in Heavenly &amp; Di∣vine Mysteries, can behold the pure, free, per∣fect, eternal and constant Love of Christ Jesus towards his Church, and every faithful Soul, as also the love of his Church towards him, and the great benefit she reapeth by him.</P>
<P>Secondly, For the Title and Subject, or mat∣ter of this most excellent Book: As there is <HI>Sabbatum Sabbati.</HI> So this is a <HI>Song of Songs</HI>; because of all that <HI>Solomon</HI> indited, this is most divine and most excellent: Wherein he most lively and affectionately, by Allegorical and Pa∣rabolical Speeches, deciphers out, and describes unto us the most Holy and Perfect Love of

For Christ and his Church are here brought in, in this worthy Book, as two Para∣mours, who are in love, one with the other, as the time of wooing ever goeth before the So∣lemnization of Matrimony, of those which in due time purpose to Marry, <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.18. as <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> were first espoused before they came together, so the same order is observed in this Spiritual Union betwixt Christ and his Church, <HI>Job</HI> 3.29. They must first be contracted, then afterwards married: The contract is, when a man is Regenerate and born a new, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.9. Translated out of Nature into Grace, depending only upon our Saviour Christ for Salvation, and finished and made up in the day of Judgment, when all the Elect shall surely enjoy God: For so witnesseth the Holy Ghost, where it is said, <HI>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give Honour to him: For the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife has made her self ready,</HI> Rev. 19.7. So then this Book contains in it the wonderful love, &amp; mu∣tual affection betwixt our Saviour Christ and his Spouse, the true Church of God, and every true Believer. This may serve touching the Book it self; we will now come to the words of the Text.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loveth.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter, the Church beginning to speak to Christ, and being ra∣vish'd in heart with his love, desires more ear∣nestly to be embraced of him, that she might be joined unto him, prefering Christ Jesus with
<PB N="3" REF="002963_0100_0FE6AA4423BFD718"/>
the Blessings and Benefits she reaped by him, before all other things in the World.</P>
<P>In the fourth Verse she confesseth her ina∣bility and want of power to embrace Christ; and therefore she desireth him to draw her heart by his Word and Spirit, whereby she sheweth her earnest desire to receive Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. She removes an objection <HI>that</HI> might be made; for it might be said, Alas, thou art black and deformed: how canst thou hope that he will take any pleasure in thy Beauty, see∣ing that he is the most Pure, Blessed and Glo∣rious Son of God: To this she confesses, that tho' by Nature she be black and full of ble∣mishes, and natural Corruption, by reason of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Original Sin, Natural Pollutions, &amp; actual Transgressions, yet notwithstanding, being Wa∣shed in Christ's Blood, Cloathed with his Righ∣teousness, and being Deckt and Beautified with the Graces of his Spirit, Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Zeal, Patience, Love, Obedience, &amp;c. <HI>She is fair and Comely.</HI></P>
<P>Now in the Seventh Verse, she puts up an earnest request to Christ, that he would in mercy shew her where he feedeth his Flock, and where he provides comfort for them in the time of Trouble. For Christ being the great Shepherd, his Church on Earth seeks only after him for Food, resting assured that there is but one true Shepherd, who feedeth all his Sheep with wholesome Pasture.</P>
<P>In these two Verses, are two things to be considered, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="002963_0101_0FE6AA4438E44520"/>
<ITEM>1. The Request &amp; Petition which the Church maketh unto Christ, <HI>Verse</HI> 7.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The most kind and loving Answer of Christ unto his Church, directing and comforting her, according to her Petition. <HI>Verse</HI> 8</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In the first of these, we are to consider two things.</P>
<P>First, The Request: And,</P>
<P>Secondly, The Reason of the Request.</P>
<P>In the Request, note first the Person whom she implores, <HI>O thou whom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Request it self, which is two-fold.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Jesus Christ would shew her where he feeds his Flock, with his holy Word and Sacra∣ments; to the end that he would feed her, as he fed the Flocks of former times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Where he provides shelter and shade in the heat of Persecution? At the manner of She∣pherds was in these hot Countries, to drive their sheep to shade in the heat of the day.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And lastly, The Reason, <HI>For why should I be as one that turneth aside by the Flocks of thy Com∣pansons</HI>? So that if Christ do it not, it will not be for his Honour, nor yet for her good.</P>
<P>First, For the Person to whom she seeketh for direction and sure comfort, it is Christ Je∣sus the Saviour and Redeemer of his Church and People; whom she describeth thus: <HI>O thou whom my Soul loveth,</HI> &amp;c. That is to say, O Lord Jesus Christ, my only Saviour and Redeemer, whom I love with all my Heart; yea whom I love most earnestly above all the World: So as if the Question were asked, what I love best
<PB N="5" REF="002963_0101_0FE6AA4438E44520"/>
in all the World; I speak it from my heart, It is thou Lord alone,</P>
<P>Hence we learn, with what affection every Child of God, and true Believer must love our Saviour Christ: Namely, with the greatest and strongest affection of love they can; So as if it were asked, what or whom dost thou love most? Thou canst truly say with the Church here, The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>O hou whom my Soul Loveth</HI> So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Peter</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se Love was so great, that he died for Christ: So that he might very well say to Christ when he asked him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is Question whether he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m or no? <HI>Yea L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Thou knowest that I love thee.</HI> Joh. 11 15. The like is to be seen in <HI>Mary,</HI> whose Love was so great to Christ, that in Testimony thereof she washed his feet with the Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head; so that Christ gives this Testimony of her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her everlasting Praise, <HI>That she loved much:</HI> So doth the Church and Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fit her love to her Husband in divers places of this most worthy Book calling Jesus Christ her beloved, <HI>My Beloved spake and said</HI> &amp;c. And again, <HI>Stay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aggons, and comfort me with Apples, for I am sick of Love,</HI> Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2.5. Yea, it is a precept given by the Lord God himself, that he must have the chiefest Love, and the first from in our Hearts <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might,</HI> Deut. 6.5. The Lord will not be satisfied with the Love o our Eyes, to behold his Works; the Love of the Ear, to listen to his Word; the Love of the Tongue, to talk of him; the Love of the Feet to go to the Sanctuary; but the Lord requires
<PB N="6" REF="002963_0102_0FE6AA4562C4F0A0"/>
all these Loves together in one. So as a Man may truly say with <HI>David</HI> the Prophet, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I desire besides that,</HI> Psal 73 25 The Lord allows not that a man should have two Hearts, one for God, and another for the Devil; <HI>We cannot serve God and Mammon:</HI> We must not part our Love to the World, the Flesh and the De∣vil; divided it must not be, Christ must have it all. Now the Reasons are divers, to shew with what an ardent affection we must love Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>First. Because he is our Husband, and we are his Spouse, for so saith the Prophet, <HI>Isa</HI> 54 5. <HI>For thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name:</HI> And again, <HI>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her self ready</HI> Rev. 10.7. Now our Spiritual Services and Worship of God (is as it were) ascertain Marriage of our Souls unto God when we take upon us the pro∣fession of Jesus Christ, as in Baptism, then we betroth our selves to Christ as to an Husband, entring into Covenant with Christ, to keep only to him unto our lives end. So then, by this means the Lord is become our Husband, and we his Spouse. Now then, as an honest man cannot endure that another should have an inte∣rest in his Wife, so will not Christ endure that another should have with him any interest or portion in his Church. <HI>For he is a jealous God, Exod.</HI> 20 4, 5. So then the force of the Reason standeth thus: God's People which are Mar∣ried unto Christ, must love Christ alone, be∣cause we are linked and Married unto him a∣lone,
<PB N="7" REF="002963_0102_0FE6AA4562C4F0A0"/>
as a Wife to her Husband, unto whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one she is bound.</P>
<P>Therefore if we forsake the Lord, and break the Promise we made to him in Baptism, and betroth our selves unto others, then will he cast us off, give us a Bill of Divorcement, as shame∣less Strumpets, and punish us for our unthank∣fulness.</P>
<P>Secondly, He loved us first and best, and ac∣cording to that of St. <HI>John</HI> 4.19. <HI>We love him, because he first loved us.</HI> Yea he loved us first when we were his Enemies, and had made a voluntary separation between him &amp; our Souls, committing Spiritual Fornication with Sin and Satan. Yea, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> witnesseth, <HI>Eph.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1. <HI>You hath he quickned who were dead in Sin.</HI> And lest he should any whit doubt of his love, he hath manifested it in that <HI>He washed us from our Sins in his own Blood,</HI> Rev. 1.5. O then greater Love than this can no man shew? Christ loved us first; And he invitesus to love him; and shall not we love him again? It is a great sin of ingratitude, not to love where we are beloved for our good: And therefore see∣ing Christ hath loved thy Soul so dearly, as to suffer a cursed death, yea to shed his own Blood to save thy Soul, O how oughtest thou to love Christ again? If a Man were taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and put to extream slavery and bon∣dage, where he should remain for ever, unless a great Sum of Money were paid for his Ransom, which he is never able to pay, how miserable and grievous were the estate of this Man! But if one should come out of meer love &amp; affecti∣on unto him, pitying his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fortune,
<PB N="8" REF="002963_0103_0FE6AA458363D7F8"/>
and should pay his Ransom, and set him free, who can express how much this poor Wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch were bound unto him? We are all taken Pri∣soners, and that not by the <HI>Turks,</HI> which only can hold, us in Temporal Bondage, but by the Subtilty of Satan the Prince of Darkness: where we should have endured not a Temporal, but a Spiritual and Eternal Bondage and Slavery, and that, in Hell for evermore; and nothing but only the Blood of the Son of God could pay our Ransom.</P>
<P>Oh how should this work upon the affections of every Christian Man and Woman, and even bind us to love Christ again: Now, what could bind Christ, but only his love to give himself to death for us? Surely nothing that was in us. <HI>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sin, hath quickned us together with Christ, by whose Grace ye are saved,</HI> Eph. 2.4. And again, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.26. <HI>Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us. In whom</HI> (said the A∣postle) <HI>we have Redemption through his blood,</HI> Eph. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.7. And therefore the love that Christ Jesus hath first shewed unto us, must constrain us to love Christ again.</P>
<P>And last of all, because Christ Jesus is the most excellent in himself, and therefore most worthy of our respect, for so saith the Church of God; <HI>My Beloved is white and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uddy, the chiefest of Ten Thousand.</HI> In the World we see it com∣mon, that some are beloved, because they are fair and beautiful, some because they are rich and wealthy; some because they are Eloquent
<PB N="9" REF="002963_0103_0FE6AA458363D7F8"/>
and Wise, and some because they are honou∣rably descended: Now <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> hath all these: For whatsoever may affect a man's Heart, and any way procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e love, the same is our Saviour Christ fully and absolutely, with∣out any shadow of mutability or change. For Wisdom he is the Fountain; for Truth, he is the Author; for Mercy, he is the Store House; for Riches, he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, even the Store House of all dura∣ble Riches; and for Beauty, he is the most Holy and Blessed Son of God, full of Grace and Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Oh let this serve to reprove all carnal and pro∣phane Hypocrites, Worldly men, Covetous Cormorants, who love any thing more than Christ Jesus, and his Glorious Gospel? Like the</HI> Gadarens, <HI>who pre∣ferred their Hogs before our Saviour: Yea, one mess of Pottage with</HI> Esau, <HI>that can be content with</HI> Ju∣das <HI>to sell Christ for less than Thirty Pence, that love their salthy Pleasures, Eating, Drinking, Pride, Uncleanness as</HI> Dives <HI>did,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>more than Christ and their own Souls; or like the</HI> Bethlemites, <HI>let Christ lie in the Stable amongst Beasts, for they cannot afford him one corner in their Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Again, It is the sin of Thousands that pro∣fess Christ to be their Husband, and Saviour, that yet break their Baptismal Covenant, and serve the World, and the Flesh; that pretend they love the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; yet betroth themselves to the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and serve them. Now how could that man be content with this, that his Wife should say she loves him, and yet sets her Heart up∣on
<PB N="10" REF="002963_0104_0FE6AA5204825BA0"/>
another Man? So how can we think that God will take it at our hands, if we make a shew that we love Christ, and yet are dallying with the World, Christ's Enemy; Oh he is a jealous God, and will never endure it at our hands.</P>
<P>And lastly, By the Rule of this Doctrine, are the Papists here no less to be reproved, who rob God of his Honour in calling upon Saints, and praying to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> before Christ him∣self, giving Honour and Adoration to Saints &amp; Angels, making them Mediators and Saviours. They shall find one day, that God will not put up this Robbery at their Hands, but will shew his Jealousie, and terrible anger and wrath against them, as most Sacrilegious Persons and Robbers.</P>
<P>It must stir up every Christian man to labour to find his heart ravished with the love of our Saviour: So as he can say out of the affection of his Heart, <HI>O thou whom my Soul loveth!</HI> So if the Question were demanded, what I love best? I can truly say, <HI>I love Christ more than the whole World; yea, I account all things as dross and dung to win Christ.</HI> And where Men find this true af∣fection and love of Christ in them, it is a cer∣tain sign of their Salvation, that God hath cast his love on them, so that the love of God draws love to him again. As the light of the Sun lights on the eye, and by it we see the Sun a∣gain. And as by the Impression in the Wax, we know the Seal, so by our love to God, we know his love to us. Oh how should this cause every Man and Woman amongst us, to examine their love towards Christ, that so they may ga∣ther
<PB N="11" REF="002963_0104_0FE6AA5204825BA0"/>
some Assurance to their Souls, that Christ hath cast his love upon them. And to do this, ask this Question of thy Soul. <HI>Dost thou desire with the Apostle</HI> Paul, <HI>to be loosed and to be with Christ? Is it Meat and Drink unto thee to do the Will of Christ? Is thy hand ever ready (according to thy ability) to bestow any thing upon Christ, and for the advancement of his Glory? Dost thou labour in the place where thou livest, to advance the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ?</HI> Canst thou be content to under∣go Shame, Disgrace, Troubles, Persecution and Bonds, yea, Death it self for Christ's sake? Doth the remembrance of his Coming to Judgment, chear up thy heavy Soul? And dost thou cry with the Spouse of Christ, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, Come quickly?</HI> And forsake the delights of the world with a detestation and scorn, saying with <HI>Solo∣mon, Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</HI> These are the marks and tokens whereby you may discern whether you love Christ or no.</P>
<P>But because all Men are ready to say, that they love Christ, or it were pity that they should live, when indeed the love of Christ is not in them; I will yet proceed a little further, and observe a few notes and marks, of this pure and hearty love to Christ, which are most certain signs of Grace.</P>
<P>First, If we love Christ, we <HI>will</HI> love his Word, delight in it, and esteem it above Gold &amp; preci∣ous Stones. <HI>O how I love thy Law, saith</HI> David, <HI>it is my meditation all the day.</HI> Yea, it is altogether impossible for a Man to be religious, to fear God, and to love him, that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found love or delight in the Word of God; so that by our
<PB N="12" REF="002963_0105_0FE6AA52199B6798"/>
love to his Word, we may judge of our <HI>love</HI> to Christ; no <HI>love</HI> nor delight in the Word, surely no <HI>love</HI> nor delight in Christ; great <HI>love</HI> to the Word, great <HI>love</HI> to Christ. In the Valuing of this Pearl, <HI>Davids</HI> practice is notable, <HI>who made the Testimonies of God his Heritage, and the Joy of his Heart, and esteemed them above Gold, yea, above fine Gold</HI> And (therefore seeing most men have no delight in the Word, seldom or <HI>never</HI> hear it, (unless it be for fashion sake) read it, or me∣ditate on it day or night; it is a certain token that the <HI>love</HI> of Christ is not in them.</P>
<P>Secondly, If we <HI>love</HI> Christ Jesus with all our hearts, we will <HI>love</HI> those whom he <HI>loves,</HI> his blessed Members, True Christians. <HI>Hereby</HI> (saith St. <HI>John</HI>) <HI>we know that we are passed from death unto life; because we love the Brethren?</HI> 1 Joh. 3.24. <HI>David</HI> testifies of himself, <HI>all my delight is in thy Saints.</HI> It is our duty to <HI>love</HI> all, but we must <HI>love</HI> the Saints with a peculiar and special <HI>love</HI>; as Heirs with Christ, &amp; Members of the same Body with us; therefore seeing men generally hate the Members of Christ, contemn and despise them; doth not this make it very apparent, that the <HI>love</HI> of Christ is not in them, for the World <HI>loves</HI> her own. <HI>But because ye are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you, John</HI> 15.19.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If we <HI>love</HI> our <HI>Saviour,</HI> we must shew it by obedience to his Word and Holy Laws. For so saith Christ, <HI>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</HI> John 15.14. Little Obedi∣ence, little love; No Obedience to Christ's
<PB N="13" REF="002963_0105_0FE6AA52199B6798"/>
Will, no Love; hearty Obedience, hearty <HI>Love.</HI> And therefore seeing generally men rebel against his Word, and break his Commandments; tho' these men should swear they <HI>love</HI> Christ, yet they are Lyars, and the <HI>love</HI> of Christ is not in 'em; for who can believe that a Traitor can Love his Prince.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If we <HI>love</HI> our <HI>Saviour,</HI> we cannot endure to hear him blasphemed, his Word con∣temned, or his Sabbath prophan'd, but it will grieve us at the <HI>very</HI> heart; and we will (to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our power) defend his cause, as a <HI>lo∣ving</HI> Child the cause of his Father, and a faithful Servant the credit of his Master; and withal it will make us be content to endure some Tryal and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution for his sake, yea, loss of Liber∣ty, Wealth, Riches, as <HI>Job</HI> did; Yea, Life it∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f; who hath so loved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that he shed his Blood for us. Thus much of the affection of the Church towards Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Now to come to the Petitions themselves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Tell me, O thou whom who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Soul loveth, where thou Feedest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Church here, as in many other pla∣ces of Scripture, compares Christ Jesus to a good and faithful Shepherd, as the Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah</HI> descri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 40.11. <HI>He shall gather the Lambs with his Arms.</HI> And again, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.10. <HI>Behold I with require my Flock of the She∣pherds, and I my self wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feed my Sheep, &amp; cause them to rest quietly.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is acknowledged of the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 22 1. <HI>The Lord is my

<P>Now the Church of Christ puts up her re∣quest to this great Shepherd and Bishop of his Church, that he would be pleased to tell her where he feeds his Sheep, with the Preaching of the Word; and the use of the Sacraments that she may joyn with them, there to be fed and comforted.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quest.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But was not this the true Church, that moved this Question? What is then that other Church or Flock she enquires after?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Answ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' the Church of God is but one in all the World, yet it hath divers parts; as the Sea, though but one, yet it is called by divers Names, according to the place where it lies; even so the Church of Christ, though but one, yet it hath divers parts, as the Holy Spirit distinguisheth of it, writing to the se∣ven Churches which are in <HI>Asia</HI> Now of the whole Church of Christ, some parts of it are at peace and quiet, free from Persecution, when other parts may suffer Persecutions and Molestations. Now in this place the Church of God, in persecution and great affliction, desireth to know of Christ, <HI>where he feeds his sheep,</HI> that is, where the Church is at rest and peace, where the Word is purely preached, the Sacraments duly administred, and Dis∣cipline duly performed, that she might joyn with them in the Service of Almighty God.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002963_0106_0FE6AA54FAB0BC08"/>From this Request and earnest suit of the Church to Christ, to know where he feeds his Sheep, we may learn: That it is a true note of a Sheep of Christ Jesus, to hunger &amp; thirst after the Word of God, to enquire where Christ feeds his Flock, where the Word is tru∣ly and faithfully preached; and the Holy Sa∣ments duly administred. And this our Saviour himself observes to be the mark of his Sheep, Joh. 10.27. <HI>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: But the voice of a Stran∣ger will they not hear.</HI> This Affection was in Godly <HI>David; O Lord, how amiable are thy Taber∣nacles! How doth my Soul long after they Altars, O when shall I come and appear before the Lord in Sion!</HI> And this duty is imposed upon every Christian, for to have an earnest affection to the Word of God. As when a man is hungry, the Veins sucking moisture at the bottom of the Stomach, he feels a pain that makes him desire meat; e∣ven so our Souls void of Grace and nourishment unto eternal life, should hunger and thirst after Christ and his Righteousness; after his Word, which is the true Spiritual food of our Souls. As till a man be hungry he wants no meat, so till we see our wants, we never seek to have our silly Souls fed with the Word of God. Now in that so few desire the Word of God, and so few esteem of it, it shews that very few feel their want of food, very few can discern their misery and wretched estate, but most men run on in sin, joy themselves in their evil ways, and <HI>never</HI> say, <HI>Alas! What have I done? Jer.</HI> 8.6. We must <HI>desire</HI> the <HI>sincere</HI> Milk of the <HI>Word,</HI> as the Infant does the Mothers Breasts, <HI>and as the Hart doth the River of Waters,</HI> Psal. 42. And as the
<PB N="16" REF="002963_0107_0FE6AA5518CBE680"/>
Church doth here. <HI>Tell me where thou feedest thy Flock.</HI> We should do as the Earth doth in time of <HI>drought</HI>; she opens <HI>her</HI> mouth, begging and gaping until the <HI>Lord</HI> send Rain. The <HI>Beggar never</HI> begs so earnestly, till he feels his own want, and then he will spare no time, labour, nor words: So till we see our own wants, we <HI>never</HI> seek for the Spiritual food of our Souls. But <HI>they are blessed which hunger and thirst after Righte∣ousness,</HI> Mat. 5.6. Though we think we <HI>are</HI> happy when we feel no want: And it is common to say, <HI>I never doubted of my Salvation, I would be loth my Conscience should so trouble me,</HI> &amp;c. But sure it is the beginning of Grace to find our selves want Grace. Those that eat upon a full Sto∣mach, it doth them least good: So they that are full, and feel not the want of the Word, it doth them little good.</P>
<P>And the Reason is, that if we do not hunger and thirst after the Word of God, we can <HI>never</HI> enjoy the Variety of all those good things which are laid up in the Word, for as all good things we have, and enjoy in this present life, are ap∣pendences to the Word, by which Word, &amp; by Prayer, they are sanctified unto us. Now it is got and obtained no other way, but by thirsting after it, as the blessed Virgin saith in her Song, Luke 1.53. <HI>He filleth the hungry with good things, and the rich he sendeth empty away.</HI> Which may serve to comfort the distressed Children of God, which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w their thirsting Affection, by their great labour &amp; travel to hear the Word preach∣ed, though they meet with mocking &amp; sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffing for it, by such as are far from thirsting after it themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002963_0107_0FE6AA5518CBE680"/>Secondly, If we should not eagerly seek after the Word of God, we should <HI>never</HI> know how much we are beholding unto the Lord, for the manifold Graces and Blessings which we receive every day from our most merciful God thereby. For so saith <HI>Solomon, The full Soul loatheth the honey comb; but unto the hungry Soul, every bitter thing is sweet,</HI> Prov. 27.7. So that when we see our Spiritual Poverty, it will then make us prize the excellency of that benefit we enjoy, when we have, the Word truly and sin∣cerely preached and taught among us.</P>
<P>Seeing this longing desire after Christ and his Word, is the badge and mark of the Sheep of Christ, and of the true Church and Children of God: This Doctrine then maketh a plain distinction betwixt the Sheep of Christ, &amp; the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of Satan. The Sheep of Christ, long after their Shepherd, desire to be instructed by him, hunger after the true Word preached and taught, with for the Sabbath, <HI>Enquire where Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth feed his Sheep, in the green Pastures of his Word and Sacraments</HI>▪ But the Goats loath the Word, and the preaching of it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.8. <HI>They tread down the pasture of the Sheep,</HI> &amp;c. Yea, they are weary of it, they will not go to the door to hear, <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.13. They can be content as well to want it, as to have it; so that hereby we may judge our own Estates, whether we are the true Sheep of Christ, or the Goats of Satan; the Children of God, or Limbs of the Devil: Dost thou love the Word of God more than thy appointed food? Tell me, dost thou desire to be taught in the Word? E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irest thou where Christ doth feed his Sheep with good pasture? And dost thou
<PB N="18" REF="002963_0108_0FE6AA625229BC08"/>
delight in his word? <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.27. These are the marks of Christ's sheep, and may minister com∣fort unto thy Soul, if thou art one of those that belong unto his fold; but if on the con∣trary thou loath and abhor the Word of God, &amp; hast no desire at all to tread in God's House, but spendest the Sabbath irreligiously, vainly &amp;, prophanely at Dice, Cards, Bowls, or Tables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> O deceive not thine own Soul, it is a sign that thou art none of Christ's Sheep, but one of the stinking Goats of Satan; and there will come a day of separation, when Christ Jesus the great Shepherd will divide the Sheep from the Goats: When he shall set the Sheep on the right hand, and the Goats on the left.</P>
<P>The same Doctrine serves to reprove three sorts of men.</P>
<P>First, Atheists, that think it lost labour to be Religious, and that there is no good got by hearing Sermons, nor leading a Godly Life. Oh it hath ever been the cursed thought of a mans heart to think so, as was used in the time of the Prophet <HI>Malachy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st labour to serve the Lord. And what good cometh there by serving of God?</HI> O then let such be warned betimes, that if they look to have any comfort in Death &amp; after Death, now they labour to be approved for sheep of the fold of Christ.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Papists which keep poor men in ignorance and blindness: And all others, which seek by all means possible, to hinder Christ's Sheep from endeavouring to be taught which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therwise would enquire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Where Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Sheep,</HI> where the Word is truly prea∣ched
<PB N="19" REF="002963_0108_0FE6AA625229BC08"/>
and taught, and the Sacraments duly administred. These are like the Scribes and Pharisees, <HI>who shut up the Kingdom of Heaven, and will not enter themselves, nor suffer those that would:</HI> Whereas the Scriptures do require of all men the <HI>Spirit of discerning,</HI> 1 Joh. 4.1. <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Spirits, whether they be of God</HI>; that so they may allow of those things which are good: and be without offence till the day of Christ: Otherwise, if they follow their false Teach∣ers, they are sure to perish, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14. <HI>For if the blind leads the blind, they both fall into the ditch.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, All carnal and secure Worldlings▪ who although they do enquire where they may buy a good bargain, or get a good purchase, and labour for that, yet never enquire, <HI>Where Christ feeds his Sheep.</HI> Oh! it is a wonder to see how men covet pleasures, profits and pre∣ferments; these they seek with might and main; surely by this they declare to the World, that they are none of Christ's Sheep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for if they were, <HI>they would hear his voice, and follow him,</HI> Joh. 10.27,</P>
<P>Seeing the true Church of God doth here seek unto Christ Jesus to be taught and di∣rected, we learn that it is the Duty of the true Church of God to acknowledge Christ Jesus alone for their great Pastor and Shepherd, the only Head and chief Bishop of his Church, &amp; therefore to be ruled by him, and his Word alone, to be content to be led and governed by this great Pastor &amp; Shepherd of the Church. Joh. 10 14. <HI>I am the true Shepherd, and know my Sheep, and am known of mine.</HI> This is acknow∣ledged by <HI>Peter,</HI> in the behalf of his Disciples.
<PB N="20" REF="002963_0109_0FE6AA62672EBF18"/>
John 6.68. <HI>Master, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life,</HI> Mat. 28.20. <HI>And Christ hath promised to be present with his Church even to the end of the world.</HI> And again he saith, <HI>That where two or three are gathered togethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my Name, I will be in the midst of them.</HI></P>
<P>And the reason to be marked and well con∣sidered, which serves likewise for the confir∣mation of this point of Doctrine unto us is, because the work of Salvation is wholly and only wrought by him, and no part thereof reserved to any Creature; as the Apostle wit∣nesses, when he saith, <HI>That amongst men there is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we may be saved, but only by Jesus Christ.</HI> And likewise St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.</HI></P>
<P>This condemns the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as no true Church of God, first, because they will not content themselves with our Saviour Christ to be their great Pastor and general Shepherd, but they set up the Pope as his Vicar, and prefer him before Jesus Christ: Nay, they will not be content with that Pasture which Christ alloweth for his sheep, the green pas∣ture of his Sacred Word, and clear streams of his blessed Gospel, but they will feed upon the trash and filthy dregs of their own d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vi∣sings, the foolish devices, inventions and tra∣ditions of Men, of the Popes and Cardinals: and by this they declare to the World, they are no Sheep of Christ, <HI>in that they will not hear his voice, and follow him,</HI> Joh. 10.27. Nor be content with the food he hath prepared for them, but feed upon filthy Puddles of Mens Traditions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002963_0109_0FE6AA62672EBF18"/>This may serve to admonish all the faithful Ministers of Jesus Christ, which stand in his stead. t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at they teach nothing but the truth of God, wholesome Doctrine, not their own Devices and Dreams to please their Auditories Ears, but not profit their Souls: So on the con∣trary, you that are the hearers, must content your selves with the pastures of God's Word the plain and pure Preaching of the Word of God, and not to be carried away to listen after strange Shepherds; that teach erroneous Doct∣rine, that may corrupt, or the devices of Man, which may tickle the Ear, and not work Grace in the Heart. And such are the wicked Doct∣rines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which will poyson Mens Souls, rather than edifie them; as their Doctrine of Merits, Invocation of Saints, and praying for the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which because they have no footing in God's Word, are here con∣demned as no wholesome Pasture for God's Sheep to feed upon.</P>
<P>And thus much for the Churches first Re∣quest; the second followeth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And where thou makest thy Flock to rest at Noon.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the better understanding of these words, we must know that it was the custom of the Shepherds in those hot Countries, to drive their Sheep to the Pastures in the Morning; &amp; when the Sun waxed hot, to drive them to the Water, &amp; at Noon to carry them to some shade, where they might rest, in the heat of the day, lest they should be annoyed with the scorching heat, and Beams of the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002963_0110_0FE6AA63866BB128"/>So here the Church of God, and the Spouse of Christ, compares Christ Jesus to a faithful &amp; true Shepherd, and entreats him to tell her where he feeds his Flock, that is, his faithful People, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd shelter and comfort in the heat of Persecu∣tion, when the Sun is hottest at Noon-day; that is, in the greatest and hottest Persecution of the Church of God, in the most dangerous and troublesome Tryal, and Times of great Extremity, as it was in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> Days: which is here meant by Noon-day, when the Sun is most hot and scorching, according to that of our Saviour, speaking of a sort of evil Hear∣ers: <HI>And when the Sun was up, they were scorched &amp; for lack of rooting, it withered away.</HI></P>
<P>From whence we observe a twofold Instruc∣tion. 1. <HI>That the Church of God sometimes is in the very heat of Persecution.</HI> 2. <HI>That Christ the good Shepherd, even then forsakes not his; but at Noon day, even in the extremity of the same, provides a shade and place of comfort and refreshing for all those that are his sheep.</HI></P>
<P>First, We are taught here, that it is the Will of the Almighty, that his Church sometimes should be tried.

And this have we had experience of in this Land, as in the days of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when the Sun did parch, and that the fire of Persecution was great, to the wasting of the Bodies of many Learned Di∣vines, and dear Children of God; so that if we hope to live with Christ in the Church Trium∣phant we must first die with him here in the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch Militant: For none shall Reign with Christ there, that have not suffered with him in this World; nor none shall have their Tears wiped from them in the Kingdom of Heaven, that have not fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st shed them on the Earth. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us having seen the Doctrine, that is the states and condition of God's Church here upon Earth, to undergo sometimes many and grievous Af∣flictions; now let us see the Reasons, that so the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine may leave the greater Impression in every one of our minds and affections.</P>
<P>In regard of God's Enemies themselves, which know not the Father, nor his Son Christ Jesus,
<PB N="24" REF="002963_0111_0FE6AA63A12609C8"/>
they have nothing to stop their cruel Rage and Devilish Malice, as our Saviour witness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th when he saith, <HI>They shall Excommun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cate you. yea, the time shall come, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth God service: and these things will they do, because they have not known the Father∣mor yet me:</HI> So that it is no marvel though the enemies of God's Church strive against the Servants of God, being stirred up there∣unto by the instigation of Satan, seeing that they know not God, nor Jesus Christ, but have their eyes blinded by Satan, the Prince. of the World, and the pleasures of this life.</P>
<P>The Lord suffereth his Children many times to undergo some sharp and bitter Tryals of affliction, and to suffer even the scorching heat of Persecution, to make known the Patience, Vertues and Graces of his Children; as St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>it is necessary that affliction should come, that the Elect may be manifest Who they be.</HI> As it is impossible to know the Valour of a Soldier, if he lies always in the Garison, and never comes unto the Field; so it is impossible to know the Patience, Obedience, and Love of God's Chil∣dren, till Trial comes.

man to bear the yoke in his youth,</HI> and in another place, the same Prophet saith, <HI>Noah hath kept his scent, because he was not poured from vessel to vessel, but hath been it rest ever since h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s youth,</HI> Jer. 48.11. There are divers other reasons why the Lord doth thus exercise his dear Children in this Life with many crosses and affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions, to humble them for sins past, and to prevent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the time to come: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause when we perceive that the only weapon whereby Satan woundeth our Souls, is sin, it should make us repent of sins that are past, and be weary of Sins for the time to come; and also humble the pride of our hearts; for knowledge pusseth up, &amp; in what∣soever we excel our Brethren, naturally we wax proud of the same. Now when the Lord Al∣mighty by these afflictions, like a skilful Physi∣cian, lets out the superf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous Humour of pride and vain glory, then we shall perceive what we are by Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. Well, Let us then make some use of this Doctrine. We have had a long Morning, and yet we are all in peace and rest, but it will not always be Morning, the Sun will a∣rise, and it will be Noon-day; the Lord will have a time of Tryal. It is the Lord's usual dealing after a long time of peace, to bring some Tryals, that the Elect and true Christians, may be truly discerned. The Lord cannot en∣dure that his sacred and glorious▪ Gospel should be contemned and despised, as it is at this day amongst us. O then seeing we must look for a Tryal, let us prepare &amp; furnish our selves with all needful Vertues, with Patience, Courage, &amp; Zeal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Alas, we think any thing will serve
<PB N="26" REF="002963_0112_0FE6AA6F57C80340"/>
our turn now; and that to be a Christian is a small matter; but if in the time of Tryal we shrink, or yield unto the Enemy, then we shall shew our Hy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crisie and cowardice. O then let us be good Soldiers; now in the time of Peace, and provide &amp; sharpen our weapons against time of War. Let us reckon what it would cost us to be the sheep of Christ, loss of Lands, Livings, Liberty, Country, yes, Life it self; yet to resolve by the help of God, never to be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; let P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsecution come never so fierce or hot upon us.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Secondly, We learn hereby not to promise our selves worldly peace and prospe∣rity, while we continue here. For this Life is the time of a Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns warfare, nei∣ther must we look to find Heaven upon Earth; for if we will be Christ's Disciples, we must take up his Cross and follow him; we must not dream of a Vict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore we fight.

<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. Thirdly, Seeing it is the <HI>will</HI> of God <HI>that</HI> his own true Church and faithful Chil∣dren <HI>shall</HI> be tried, and undergo the heat of Persecution; Let us hence Learn to be wise and circumspect, and neither think the worse of the Gospel of Christ, because the Cross and
<PB N="27" REF="002963_0112_0FE6AA6F57C80340"/>
Tryal goes with it. We are ready to think <HI>that</HI> the Lord loves us not; or <HI>that</HI> the Gospel we profess, is not good or Orthodox, because we see it is scandalized by them of <HI>Rome. Well,</HI> it is <HI>that</HI> which God <HI>will</HI> have, it was the condition of our Saviour Christ before us; and unless we look the Servant <HI>shall</HI> be greater than his Master, it must be our lot.</P>
<P>Secondly, We Learn from hence, <HI>that</HI> tho' it may be sometimes Noon Day with the Church of God, <HI>hot and bloody Persecutions,</HI> yet Christ hath ever a shelter, shade and comfort for his chosen people; he is ever present with his Church and People, in the hottest time of Persecution and Afflictions, to comfort, refresh and deliver them. This the Lord expresseth, Isa. 54 8. <HI>For a little time have I forsaken thee, but with great compassion will I gather thee; for a moment in mine anger, I hid my face from thee, for a little season; but with everlasting mercy have I had compassion on thee.</HI> This the Prophet <HI>David</HI> makes manifest, that notwithstanding the rage or ma∣lice of God's Enemies, Psal. 2.4. <HI>He that dwelleth in Heaven shall laugh them to scorn, the LORD shall have them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rision.</HI> This comfort is excellent∣ly set forth by the Prophet. Isa. 43.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not, for I have redeemed thee: I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine: When thou passeth through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord thy God.</HI> What mis∣chief had <HI>Herod</HI> invented against the <HI>Messiah,</HI> Mat.
<PB N="28" REF="002963_0113_0FE6AA6F6CE38BF0"/>
2.12. so privately, <HI>that</HI> he disclosed the secret of his heart to none, but pretendeth to the Wise men, <HI>that</HI> his intent was to worship him, yet the Lord brought his devices to nought, and <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> with the Child Jesus, was delivered. <HI>Peter</HI> being cast into Prison, should the next day have been executed, yet through the Prayers of the Church was delivered.</P>
<P>This Doctrine is <HI>further cleared</HI> by the Exam∣ples of <HI>Joseph, Job,</HI> the Church in <HI>Egypt, Daniel, Shadrath, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hach</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI> who for a time endured the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hame and <HI>reproach</HI> of the <HI>Cross,</HI> yet afterwards the Lord Returned to them, when the time of Refreshing came: So <HI>that</HI> altho' God's Children may be under the heat of Persecution for a time, it shall be but for a Time, he will not leave them destitute of help for ever, but will in the end deliver them.</P>
<P>The Reasons to confirm this Doctrine are manifest.</P>
<P>First, Consider the Title by which God is called: A Father, to shew the care <HI>that</HI> he takes over his Church, as his Children, to provide for them and govern them. For what Father will not save his Child, if possi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e he can, from fire and water, or any other imminent danger? <HI>Now if we that are evil, know how to help our Children; how much more shall our Heavenly Father, that know∣eth all things, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve good things unto his Children?</HI> Again, Christ is called a Shepherd, as <HI>the Church</HI> doth confess in this place. Now will the She∣pherd see the Sheep go astray, and not bring the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght way again? O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffer the Wolf to devour, and not rescue them? And
<PB N="29" REF="002963_0113_0FE6AA6F6CE38BF0"/>
what shall we think <HI>that</HI> Christ the true Shepherd of his Church, will be more careless of his Flock, whom he hath purchased with no less price than his own hearts blood, than an earthly man is of his sheep. Seeing then that Christ Jesus is the King of his Church, and the Shepherd of his sheep, we need not doubt but <HI>that</HI> he will de∣fend his Church, and save his sheep, so <HI>that</HI> none shall be able to destroy them, nor take them out of his hands.</P>
<P>Secondly, Our weakness and natural corrup∣tion are not hid from the Lord: <HI>He knoweth whereof we be made, he remembreth that we are but lust:</HI> And therefore saith the Apostle, <HI>GOD is faithful, that he will not suffer us to be tempted above that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we are able; but will even with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he temp∣tation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it,</HI> 1 Cor 10.13. So then, whether we consi∣der the Office of Christ, as a Shepherd to keep his Church, or the mercy of Christ, <HI>that</HI> is <HI>over</HI> ready to cover the wants of his servants, making their afflictions to be but momentary; in these two respects we may easily gather <HI>that</HI> the Lord never forsakes his Children, but provides for 'em both shelter and comfort, when they shall find the heat of Afflictions hot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. The Use serves to direct us to whom we shoulst go in time of Trouble and great Distress, for if Christ be our Shepherd, we are to flee to him, he is a faithful Preserver of them <HI>that trust in him. Shall we go to Saints and Angels?</HI> Isa. 16.63. <HI>Doubtless, Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel knoweth us not.</HI> What then, shall we trust in our Chariots, or in our Horses? <HI>Doubtless</HI> a

<HI>Horse is counted a vain thing to save a man</HI>? Psalm 47.1. Surely we cannot honour him more than when we depend on him, and Rest upon his Mercy. Thus <HI>David</HI> behaved himself in all his extremities, flying unto God as a sure Refuge, Psal. 9▪1, 2. <HI>I will say unto the Lord, O my hope, and my fortress, he is my God, in him will I trust. He will deliver me from the snare of the hunter, and from the noisom pest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lence.</HI> His Ears are always open to the cries of his Children, he putteth their tears into his Bottle. So long therefore, as we have a voice to call upon God, or a heart to sigh and groan unto him, we have comfort and assurance to be delivered, and that he will not leave us nor forsake us in danger.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Here is matter of endless comfort unto the Church and Children of God, that they know that the Lord Jesus Christ promiseth and will provide a place of comfort and refreshing a shade even at noon-day, in the heat of of bloo∣dy Persecution. Many indeed are our infirmi∣ties, fears, cares, sorrows and troubles, yet in <HI>the</HI> midst of them all, the Children of God may say with the Prophet, <HI>Why art thou cast down (O my Soul) and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his Countenance,</HI> Psal. 42.5. O then let us be con∣stant, and comfort our selves in Christ Jesus; let us not for fear deny Christ and his Gospel? for Christ will be a shelter to refresh and deliver us.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. This shews the woful and desperate E∣state of all wicked and ungodly Men, who be∣ing out of Gods favour, nor believing in Christ,
<PB N="31" REF="002963_0114_0FE6AA7207B68C60"/>
nor repenting of their sins in time of perse∣cution, when the Sun waxeth hot: Alas! they shall not know where to hide their heads, for they shall find no shelter, nor comfort, nor place of refuge; for Christ is a shelter only to them <HI>that</HI> believe in him, &amp; obey him. And therefore thou which art a wicked man, an impenitent sinner▪ a prophane Person; alas, what wilt thou do? And which way wilt thou turn thee in the time of trouble and calamity, when the Sun waxeth hot in the heat of per∣secution and scorching Tryal? Whither wilt thou run for shelter? Alas, thou shalt then be as a beast, which in the heat of the day runs up and down, and findeth no covert. So shall all wicked and impenitent sinners have no place or succour, but lie open to all God's Judg∣ments, to be scorched, yea, even consumed with the fire of God's displeasure; when the righte∣ous, those which are in Christ Jesus, shall find shelter.</P>
<P>Now followeth the Reason which she useth to move the Lord Jesus Christ to grant her Re∣quest and Petition, taken from the great peril and danger she was like to fall into; namely, lest being left without his direction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> comfort, she be constrained, <HI>to turn aside to the Flock of thy companions.</HI> That is to say, to leave the true Church and Worship of God, and joyn with the false Church, to common Idolatry, called here, <HI>The Flock of thy companions</HI> Not for <HI>that</HI> they <HI>are</HI> either Christ's Companions, or the Companions of his Church and People; but because they account themselves so; and imagine themselves Christ's Companions: And if this thing should come to pass, through want of Christ's

assistance to direct and comfort her in Persecu∣tion, then it shall not be for his honour, nor her good. This is the substance of her reason.</P>
<P>Hence we are taught, <HI>That it is altogether im∣possible for men and women ever to stand the brunt of Persecution, unless they be taught of God, and com∣forted and assisted by his Spirit.</HI> And hence it is that the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> a Man after God's own Heart, and endued with a signal portion of <HI>God's Spirit,</HI> earnestly craves at God's hand the enlightning of his holy Spirit, desireth to be taught of him: <HI>Open mine eyes, that I may see the wondrous things of thy Law.</HI> And again, <HI>Teach me thy statutes.</HI> And again, <HI>make me to under∣stand the way of thy precepts,</HI> &amp;c. Yea, Christ tells the Jews which murmured against him, (because he said, <HI>That no man could come unto him, unless his Father drew them) that all the E∣lect are taught of God,</HI> Joh. 6.45.</P>
<P>And this made <HI>Paul</HI> to pray for the <HI>Ephesi∣sians,</HI> Eph 2. <HI>That God would give them the Spirit of wisdom, and enlighten their minds that they might know their calling, and what the riches of his glorious Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>A notable direction to all sorts of men, how to behave themselves, when they come into the House of God; namely, not to rest on a∣ny natural gift, whatsoever it be, Wisdom, Learning, Wit, Memory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. <HI>For the Wisdom of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is enmity with God.</HI> But to go out of our selves, and to seek the Lord with humility, and self denial, and then the Lord will give us a discerning Spirit, that we shall not be deceived. <HI>If any man</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>will do my Fathers Will, he shall know of the Doc∣trine,
<PB N="33" REF="002963_0115_0FE6AA721F2367B0"/>
whether it be of God,</HI> Joh 7.27. And again, Christ promiseth his Disciples, being now to leave them, and go to his Father, <HI>that the spi∣rit of truth shall lead them into all truth.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And the Reasons are,</HEAD>
<P>First, We are blind, and by nature can hardly see into the truth, unless God direct us by his Spirit; for so saith <HI>Solomon.</HI> Prov, 14.12. <HI>The ways that seen right unto us; the issues thereof are the ways of Death.</HI> It is a part of our misery, <HI>that we are turned every one to his own way.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, When we know it alas! we are of our selves so weak, and flesh and blood will be so unwilling to suffer for Christ's sake, that unless the Lord do assist us, we shall not be able to undergo the least temptation that shall be laid upon us:</P>
<P>And lastly, The Enemies of God's Truth are in their Generation, so wise and subtil coming to us in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeps cloathing to deceive us, that of our selves we shall easily be drawn away to believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s. In all these respects, we may safely conclude, that it is impossible for us to hold out in the day of Tryal, un∣less we be assisted by the <HI>Lord's Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. This sheweth, that if Tryals do come and Persecutions shall arise for Christ and the Gospels sake: that alas it is to be feared most men would yield to Popery, Idolatry, Super∣stition, <HI>to the Flocks of his Companions,</HI> to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Idolatry: For alas, those that know not the truth, <HI>they are not taught of God</HI>; they are blind and ignorant,
<PB N="34" REF="002963_0116_0FE6AA7B5460FAE0"/>
and will easily believe and embrace any Re∣ligion.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. This may stir up every true Christian Man and Woman to pray to Christ, as the Church doth here, <HI>that he would teach us by his Spirit, that he would open our eyes, that we may see the truth, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s would give us hearts to believe it, to love it, and to live and die in it</HI>; that he would gave us the Spirit of discerning, <HI>to try the Spirits, whether they be of God,</HI> that we may discern truth from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hood: Yea, we must so labour to be grounded in the truth, that no affliction of any kind may remove us; that we be sure to lay a good foundation, that we dig deep into our hearts, and build on the Rock Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Though the Papists say, they are the true Church, and the <HI>Communion of Christ,</HI> yet they are the Synagoge of Satan: The main points of their Religion, bring clean contrary unto the Word of God, as their Doctrine of Merits, Invocation of Saints, and worshipping of Ima∣ges, Praying for the Dead, Sacrifice of the Mass, that so we may for ever stand out a∣gainst the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> Yea, let us intreat the Lord, that he would never suffer it to get a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> again in this Land, notwithstanding we have deserved as great a Judgment; but especially <HI>that</HI> he keep us, that we may never joyn with 'em in that bloody Religion,</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. It condemns all who are ready, ei∣ther for fear of Persecution, or by blindness or ignorance to embrace any Religion, or join

with any Church, who to keep their Livings, hold their Lands to enjoy their Honours and Pleasures, would turn as doth the wind, and embrace any Religion; joyn with Papists, Jew, Turk, yea, the Devil himself for advantage.</P>
<P>Oh, the true Church of Christ fear them∣selves and their weakness, that they should be drawn a way, and seduced to embrace a false Religion: And therefore they doubting the worst, and fearing the corruption that is in their own hearts, pray Christ that they may not be left unto themselves, but that they may find strength from him to withstand it.</P>

<P>WE have heard before of the earnest re∣quest and petition of the Church, to Christ, that he would in mercy shew them <HI>where he feedeth his Flock,</HI> and where he provideth com∣fort them in time of trouble. Here is the most kind, loving and gracious Answer of Christ Je∣sus, to the request of the Church: In which note three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. His exceeding love and kindness, in that he calls her, <HI>The fairesh among Women</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. His gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e reproof of her. <HI>If thou know not.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uoth he: This is very strange that thou <HI>which</HI> art the true Church should not know where Christ feeds his sheep.</P>
<P N="3">3. His direct answer to her request, wherein he answers her to the full: If you would know where I feed my Sheep, and would feed with them, and and find consolation to thy Soul, <HI>Then you must go in the steps of the Flock.</HI> You must embrace

the Faith, Religion, Worship and Service of God, which my ancient Servants, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> have done, and tread in their Steps. Secondly, Thou must plant thy Tents where the Shepherds have done the Patriarchs, Prophets &amp; Apostles of Christ, and their doctrine taught be∣fore. This is the substance of Christ's Answer to his Church.</P>
<P>First, Observe here how Christ describes his true Church and Spouse, giving her a most kind and loving Name, expressing his kind and sin∣gular Love unto her, <HI>O thou fairest among Wo∣men.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quest</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But this may seem strange, for the Church confesseth before, that she was black and Sunburnt, deformed,</HI> &amp;c <HI>How then can Christ call her,</HI> Fair∣est among Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Answ.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Church and every true Believer, are black and deformed in themselves, vile and deformed by Nature, and they can see no beauty in themselves, but are blemished; yea, &amp; stain'd with Sins Original and Actual. But as they are sanctified by his Spirit, washed with his Blood, and cloathed in his Righteousness, they are Fair and Beautiful in the sight of God, because <HI>Christ hath washed them from all their sins in his Blood</HI>; &amp;c. covered them with the pure Robes of his own Righteousness.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here mark the endless love of Christ Jesus to his poor Church and People, that esteemeth so highly of them, as if they had no spot of sin &amp; uncleanness, though they in themselves be black, deformed, and polluted; yet all those who truly repent, embrace Jesus Christ, and believe in him, that are washed from their sins, Sanctified by his Spirit, and obey his Will, all these are Fair;
<PB N="37" REF="002963_0117_0FE6AA7B6A0E0978"/>
Yea, most Beautiful in his Eyes. This is con∣fessed by wicked <HI>Balaam,</HI> when he saw no policy nor device could take any place against the Church of God. Hereunto come the titles and commendations given to the Church so often in this most excellent Book of the <HI>Canticles: She is the Rose of the Field, the Lilly of the Valley, the fairest among Women, an Orchard of Pomegranates, a Well of Springing Waters, the Spouse and Sister of Christ, the Beauty of the Earth, the Glory of the World, a Lilly among Thorns, &amp;c.</HI> These and the like serve to confirm the everlasting truth of this Doctrine unto us, how dear and precious the Church is in Christ's sight, that of all So∣cieties and Assemblies of Men in the World, none are more excellent and worthy, more a∣miable and lovely, none more beautiful &amp; pre∣cious, than the <HI>Church of God, the Spouse of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And the Reason of the Doctrine is apparent. Man was first cast out of Paradise for sin, nei∣ther is there any thing that doth hinder his re∣turn, but only sin; for it is sin that separates &amp; hinders all good things from us. For so long as sin remains, it's a weighty burden to press down a sinner into Hell, &amp; the wages of it is Eternal Death, Therefore if sin be pardoned, as it is to all the Elect, what should hinder their happi∣ness? God hath against them no displeasure, the Obedience of Jesus Christ being imputed unto them, Heaven cannot be denied them, but they must needs be saved.</P>
<P>Secondly, Christ Jesus doth esteem highly of his Church, and the Church is most excellent in her self, because in it, alone Salvation is to be
<PB N="38" REF="002963_0118_0FE648707818EA88"/>
found, and no where else. When the LORD brought the great and general Deluge over the face of the whole Earth, what place was there left more excellent than the Ark, in which <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family were saved, &amp; the whole World besides Perished? What was the Ark but a type and figure of Christ's Church, wherein Salvation is to be found, and out of which is no Salvation to be looked for. Seeing therefore, that Remis∣sion of sins is proper only to Christ's Church, &amp; that therein is Salvation and Eternal Life to be found, we may safely conclude, that the Estate of Christ's Church, and every Member thereof, is most excellent and Blessed.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. The Use of this Doctrine is Excellent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Nature of the Church is.</P>
<P>First then, seeing <HI>that</HI> Christ <HI>will</HI> pass by the sins of his Children and judge them <HI>Fair,</HI> with∣out spot or blemish of Sin, if they truly Re∣pent, and embrace him and his Righteousness by Faith: Here is matter of endless comfort to e∣very poor Child of God.</P>
<P>Dost thou Repent of thy Sins, and art truly humbled for 'em? <HI>Dost thou embrace Christ Je∣sus for the Pardon of them? Hath God Sanctified thy Heart by his Spirit, so that thou hatest every wicked way, and desirest and endeavourest to obey God's Will in all his Commandments</HI>? Then comfort thy self, and chear up thy Soul, Christ Jesus <HI>will</HI> cover <HI>all</HI> thy Sins: they <HI>shall</HI> never be laid to thy charge, but he <HI>will</HI> cloath thee with his own Righteous∣ness, whereby thou shalt appear Fair &amp; Beauti∣ful in his sight. Indeed many a poor Child of God looking upon their own infirmities, and
<PB N="39" REF="002963_0118_0FE648707818EA88"/>
manifold corruptions, see themselves to be black indeed, deformed and stained with sin; it grie∣veth them <HI>that</HI> they hang down their heads and go drooping <HI>all</HI> their days, striving &amp; struggling with their rebellious Hearts, and vile corrupti∣ons, thinking <HI>that</HI> Christ Jesus cares not for them, cannot love them, being so defil'd with sin.</P>
<P><HI>But be not discouraged; for if thou repent of them, believe in Christ, hate thy sins, and prayest often to God, to give thee power to withstand them, using all godly means so to do, Christ Jesus will cover, &amp; pass by them all, as he dealth with</HI> David, Peter, <HI>&amp;c, Oh then! What care ought all men daily to take to be members of this Society, that they may have a part in all these excellent Prerogatives? And then though the World esteem them not, but count them miserable, grin∣ning and nodding at them with their Head, and every way contumeliously reproaching them, yet they are most dear and precious in the sight of Christ, who hath re∣deemed them with the Ransom of his own Blood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. Let us learn by Christ's Example here, <HI>that</HI> if we see any good thing in a Child of God, to commend it, and embrace it. And if we see any blemish or infirmity, <HI>that</HI> we wink at it and cover the same with a cloak of Love; and not as the manner of Wicked and Urgedly men is, who, though they see many good Gifts &amp; Graces in Gods Children, as Obedience, Faith, Patience and Love. pass by <HI>all</HI> that; and if they espy but one blemish and weakness, they blaze it abroad with open mourn; blast their Reputation, <HI>calling</HI> them <HI>Puritans Hypocrites,</HI> and the like, Reviling them in a most odious manner, like the Horse Fly pass by many Flowers and sweet Herbs, &amp;
<PB N="40" REF="002963_0119_0FE6AA7F615DC750"/>
lights upon some noisom Weed: These are not like to Christ, but to the Devil.</P>
<P>Thus much of the exceeding Love and Kind∣ness of Christ Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church, in <HI>that</HI> he <HI>calls</HI> her by this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appellation, <HI>The Fair∣est among Women.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, His gentle Reproof of her; <HI>If thou knowest not</HI> (quoth he:) This seemeth strange thou shouldest be ignorant where I feed my Sheep, where my Truth and Gospel is purely preached, and soundly professed; but if thou know not, I <HI>will</HI> direct, and shew thee how to find it out.</P>
<P><HI>Hence we are taught, that the Church of God and true Believers, may sometimes be so blind, and left to themselves, that they are at a stand, and hardly know which is the true Religion,</HI> Where Christ doth feed his Flock, <HI>where the Word is faithfully preached and professed; for we are all ready to err by Nature. How apt are we in matters that concern our Souls, to be mistaken through our carelesness in not searching of the Truth, and trying of the Spirits: And also by the subtil policy of the Devil, who apes the Almighty in many things, as that it is hard to discern his slights</HI> &amp; <HI>falshoods; Wicked men, false Teachers, and lying Pro∣phets, set such a face and shew on their Errors, and hear them out with such a countenance and Authority; and the Truth is so neglected, plain and simple men trodden under foot, that it is hard for a man, yea, the true Church of God sometimes to discern where Christ feedeth his Flock.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Elijah</HI> was left alone, and <HI>Bäal</HI> had five Hundred and fifty Prophets, who could almost
<PB N="41" REF="002963_0119_0FE6AA7F615DC750"/>
then discern the true Worship of God from Ido∣latry, when <HI>all</HI> was corrupted? So when <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caiah</HI> told the Truth, &amp; <HI>Ahab</HI> had four Hundred false Prophets, it was hard to discern the Truth of God from the lying of Satan.</P>
<P>In Christ's time, how did the Scribes and Pha∣risees confound Religion, dim and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Truth? For the which our Saviour himself did often Reprove them? And in our T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s how do many labour to obscure Religion? How boldly and impudently do they defend their own Traditions and Constitutions? <HI>Mat.</HI> 15 9.</P>
<P><HI>How should this stir up every Christian Man and Woman, to study the Scriptures, that so knowing the Truth: and believing the Doctrine of God we may be able to discern between Light and Darkness, Truth &amp; Falshood, Idolatry, and the Service and Worship of God. Secondly, to intreat the Almighty in all Humility, to open our eyes to discern the Truth, to give us his Holy Spirit to lead us into all Truth, to give us the Spirit of discerning to try the Spirits, and the Doctrines, whether they be of God or not; for otherwise we may be led away; and take Light for Darkness, and Dark∣ness for Light.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then confess our Ignorance and Blind∣ness, and bewail it: Let us strive against our carelesness: Let us prove the Doctrines by the Touchstone of the Word, if they be according to the Law and Prophets, else abhor them. Let us do as the Men of <HI>Berea</HI> did, <HI>Intreat the Lord to give us the Spirit of discerning, that we may cry all things, and hold the Truth:</HI> And if ever we had need to pray for the Spirit of Discerning,
<PB N="42" REF="002963_0120_0FE6AA9142DBC408"/>
now is the time. We see how bold the Devil is, how <HI>willing</HI> to deceive us; and for the Papists, they are so so impudent and shameless, to thrust upon us their cursed Idolatry; and tell us, it is the Worship of God; their abominable Mass, their Merits, Purgatory, Prayers for the Dead, Worshipping of Images, <HI>Calling</HI> upon Saints un∣known Verities, their vile Traditions fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hy Abo∣bominations, their Constitutions and vile De∣crees, as if they were the written Word of God.</P>
<P>Now unless we have knowledge, and are able by God's Spirit to discern the Spirits: Alas, we <HI>shall</HI> drink in Poyson, Idolatry and Superstition. O then let us labour to know the Word of God, believe it, obey it, be reformed by it, confess our Ignorance, and with all humility pray to God to open your Eyes, to give us the Spirit of Discerning: To know and discern the true Re∣ligion from the false; which if we do, certain∣ly the Almighty will reveal his Truth unto us. And thus much shall serve for our Saviour Christ's gentle Reproof, concerning his Church.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Christ's Answer to his Church.</HEAD>
<P>The third and last point is the direct Answer of Christ to the Request of the Church; she de∣sireth to know of Christ where he fed his Flock, and comforted them in the time of Persecution, that so she might join with them, and be defend∣ed with them from false Worship, and the Ido∣latrous Church. Here Christ answers her to the full: <HI>If thou know not, O thou fairest among Women, get thee forth by the Steps of the Sheep, and feed thy kids by the tents of the Shepherds.</HI> His
<PB N="43" REF="002963_0120_0FE6AA9142DBC408"/>
counsel stands in two parts: To shew where he feeds: Quoth he, <HI>Wouldst thou know where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feed my Sheep, and where I cause them to lie down at Noon, that thou mightest feed with them, and be in my Fold, to be defended and protected by me▪</HI> Then I counsel thee, First, to walk in the <HI>steps of the Sheep,</HI> that is, thou must walk in the steps of the faithful Servants of the LORD▪ <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI>; thou must embrace that Faith, Religion, and Worship of the Lord which they did; that is meant by the <HI>Steps of the Sheep.</HI> Secondly, thou must <HI>feed thy Kids,</HI> that is, thou must embrace that same Doctrine which the Ancient Shepherds, Fathers, Pro∣phets and Apostles have taught and delivered▪ And if thou thus tread in the steps of the Sheep, as <HI>Peter, Paul,</HI> &amp;c. and embrace and o∣bey the Doctrine taught by the Prophets and holy Apostles in the Old and New Testament, thou shalt then know where I feed my Sheep, that thou mayst feed with them, and re∣ceive me for the true Shepherd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Direction to know which is the true Church.</HEAD>
<P>From this Answer of Christ, we learn a clear direction to know true Religion, and the true Worship of God, from false Religion &amp; false Worship. If any Man desires to know where Christ feeds his Sheep, and God is truly and rightly worshipped, where true Religion is, we must then <HI>tread in the steps of the sheep</HI>; that is, we must worship God, as <HI>Abraham, I∣saac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> did, as <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets did, tread in their steps, &amp; follow their Godly Examples, believe, repent, and walk with God
<PB N="44" REF="002963_0121_0FE6AA91581B8240"/>
by Faith, as <HI>Enoch</HI> did. Such as these are the true Sheep of Christ; for of them our Saviour speaketh here, and not of a company of Popes, which greatly boast of their Succession, which we <HI>will</HI> not deny to be a Succession of Here∣ticks, as Cardinals, Jesuits, and the like of that Rabble; of whom to think that they be∣long to this Fold, I know not from whence I should fetch my Charity. Again, we must embrace and believe the Doctrine taught by <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, Christ &amp; his Apostles, who were the true Shepherds, &amp; the faithful Pastors of the Church of God. <HI>To the Law &amp; the Testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.</HI> And again, <HI>Thus said the Lord, stand in the ways, and behold and ask for the old way, which is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find peace &amp; rest for your Souls.</HI></P>
<P>So then, if we desire to know the true Re∣ligion, and the true Worship and Service of God, this is the way which I here teach, and deliver from the Lord Jesus Christ, against the Doctrine of <HI>Rome: viz.</HI> To enquire of the Faith, true Religion, and manner of Worshipping performed by <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> the Patriachs and Prophets, Christ and his Apo∣stles; believe that, embrace that, and rest your Souls on that.</P>
<P>This then may serve to decide a great Que∣stion, and a long Controversie, between us &amp; the Papists: They affirm, That they are the true Church, and we Hereticks: We believe and hold, that we are the true Church of God, and that they are not, but <HI>Babylon,</HI> and the Synagogue of Satan. This then is the main

Question, whether they or we are the true Church? Who should judge? Even the Lord Christ Jesus himself in his own Word; we must rest upon him, and flee unto him, and if the Papists would do so too, they would never have run into a Labyrinth of Contro∣versies, as they have at this very day; for Christ would quickly have put an end to all. For he saith, they are the true Church which <HI>tread in the steps of the Sheep, and feed by the tents of the Shepherds.</HI> That is, those People that be∣lieve the Worship of God, as <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> did, and that old Religion, which they believed and embraced, is the true Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> For that was taught by the holy Servants of the Almighty, who were the faithful Shepherds and Pastors, sent of God unto his Church. Now let us try, whether the Papists or the Protestants, the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the Church of <HI>England</HI> do thus. For the Papists, although they call their Religion the old Religion; yet alas, it is newly devised, the greatest part of it within these four or five Hundred years.</P>
<P>They teach such Doctrine as was never known to <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,</HI> or the Prophets; it was never known to Christ or his Apostles: They have lost the <HI>steps of the Sheep, and the tents of the Shepherds,</HI> and have got a new Religion of their own devising; they walk not in the steps of the Flock, but in the steps of the proud Popes, covetous Cardinals, leacherous Fryars, lascivious Monks: They have devised a thousand things in the Service and Worship of God, against his Word, &amp; against the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles; meerly for their own gain. Where shall we ever find, that <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="002963_0122_0FE6AA97B15AF2E0"/>
and the Prophets, pray'd unto Angels &amp; Saints, Worshipped Images, prayed for the dead, look∣ed to be saved by their own Works, by vowing of chastity, or by their Poverty? If they can shew me, any soul mouth'd Jesuit of them all, but any one Example in the whole Book of God, or any of God's Children, that have performed 'em, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>will</HI> then lay my hand upon my Mouth. In the mean time give me leave, O ye Papists, to tell you, that you are none of Christ's Church, you are none of Christ's Sheep, for you have left the <HI>steps of the Sheep, and the tents of the Shepherd:</HI> The Doctrine taught by the Prophets of God, Christ and his Apostles; and therefore are no better than the Whore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Synagogue of Satan: And as there hath been a succession of Popes and Cardinals, so they are a succession of Hereticks, that seduce ignorant people for their own private gains.</P>
<P>But as for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> we believe, and firmly embrace that old and true Religion, that is, the same Faith which <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> used. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old that Doctrine taught by the Prophets and holy Apostles of our Lord and Saviour, without adding or diminishing: And if we should dare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o devise a new kind of Faith, Religion, and Worship of God, not used nor known to the ancient Prophets, Patriarchs, Christ and his Apostles, as the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> doth, it were to leave the <HI>steps of the Sheep, and the flocks of his Companions,</HI> even to shake hands with Ido∣laters.</P>
<P>Well then, let us ever stand out against the Antichrist of <HI>Rome,</HI> and as Christ saith, come out of her, joyn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot with her in her false Re∣ligion and Idolatrous Service of God, left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="47" REF="002963_0122_0FE6AA97B15AF2E0"/>
partake of her plagues: But let us hold fast the true Religion of God. <HI>Tread in the steps of the Sheep, fed by the tents of the Shepherd.</HI> Let us live and die in the true Church of God, and for ever hold fast the true, ancient and holy Religi∣on, which we have received from the holy Pa∣triarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,</HI> the Pro∣phets, and all the holy Apostles of Jesus Christ, and then we shall be safe and sure, yea, blessed and happy for evermore.</P>

<P>IN the Morning awake with God, and before all other things Offer up unto him thy Mor∣ning Sacrifice of Prayer; wherein remember, First, to give hearty Thanks unto him for all his Mercies, Bodily and Spiritual; and namely, for thy late Preservation. Secondly, Make an hum∣ble Confession of thy Sins, with an earnest desire of Pardon. Thirdly, Ask such Necessaries as are requisite for thy Soul and Body, with fervent: Request to be relieved in them; and namely de∣sire his Blessing upon thy Labours in thy Calling in the day to come.</P>
<P>In what place soever thou art, let this Perswa∣sion abide in thy Heart, That thou art before the Living God; and let the Remembrance hereof strike thine Heart with Awe and Reverence, &amp; make thee afraid to sin.</P>
<P>Make Conscience of idle, Vain, Dishonest, and Ungodly Thoughts; for these are the Seeds and Beginnings of Actual Sins in Word and Deed.</P>
<P>Have a special care to avoid those Sins which thou findest thy Nature most prone unto, and

<P>Look well to thy Carriage in Company, that thou do no hurt, by Word or Example; nor take any thing from others, but endeavour ra∣ther to do good.</P>
<P>Use civil Honesty towards all Men: A good Conscience and good Manners go together.</P>
<P>If at any time, against thy Purpose, thou art overtaken with any Sin, lie not in it, but spee∣dily recover thy self by Repentance.</P>
<P>When any good Motion or Affection doth a∣rise in thine Heart, suffer it not to pass away, but feed it by Reading, Meditating or Praying.</P>
<P>Esteem of every present Day, as of the Day of thy Death; and therefore live now, even as tho' thou wert now Dying; and do those good Du∣ties every Day, which thou wouldest do if this were thy Dying Day.</P>
<P>At the end of the Day, before thou lie down so thy Bed, call to mind how thou hast spent the Day that is passed: Thy Misdoings Repent, and Praise God for assisting thee with his Grace in the Duties which thou hast performed.</P>
<P>Sleep not at Night, before thou hast commen∣ded thy self, by Prayer into the Hands of God; as thou knowest not whether (fall'n asleep) thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alt rise again alive.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Directions how to Die well.</HEAD>
<P>THink that the greatest Work thou hast to do in this World is to Die well, &amp; to make an happy Departure out of this World. They which Die well, Die not to Die, but to Live Eternally.</P>
<P>Be every Day ready to leave this Life. That Man doth finish his Days in best sort, that every Day esteemeth the last Day of his Life to be present and at hand.</P>
<P>Endeavour before Death come upon thee, to pull out his Sting, and take from him his Power and Strength, by humbling thy self in the time present for all thy Sins past, &amp; by turn∣ing thy self unto God for the time to come. That man can never Die ill, that hath a Care to live well.</P>
<P><HI>Inure thy self by little and little to Die before thou come to that Point that thou must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eds Die. He that leaves the World before the World leaves him, gives Death, the Hand like a welcome Messen∣ger, and departs in peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chiefly when thou art Visited with Sickness, or Old Age, think either of these a Summoner, Warn∣ing thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e long to appear before the Great Lord, Judge of all the World: Therefore now prepare to set all things in good order, and make thing Ac∣counts ready.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Make a new Examination of thy self, and Conver∣sation passed. Make a new Confession unto God of thy new and particular Sins: As God sendeth new Corrections and Chastisements, make new Prayers, &amp;
<PB N="50" REF="002963_0124_0FE6AAAF45DC3A98"/>
more earnest than ever before, for Pardon of thy Sins, and Reconciliation with God in Christ; by all means avoid those Sins which thou findest &amp; feelest encrease the Wrath of God against thee.</HI></P>
<P>Seek Reconciliation with thy Neighbour, by free forgiveness of them that have offended thee, and earnestly desire to be forgiven of <HI>all</HI> that have offended thee. Set thine House and Family in order, by disposing of thy worldly Goods in thy Will and Testament; thereby thou shalt Die not the more quickly, but the more quietly, and prevent the Brawls &amp; jars <HI>that</HI> otherwise (when thou art gone) may a∣rise from thine Heirs. Thou partest with earthly Possessions, and art going to take Pos∣session of Heavenly.</P>
<P>In the last Agony of Death, when <HI>all things,</HI> in and of the World do fail &amp; forsake thee rest thy self by Faith on the Favour &amp; Mercy of God in Christ, and Comfort thy self in the Lord thy God. What shall separate from the Love of God in Christ? Not Life nor Death.</P>
<P>Let thine Heart and Tongue be still employ'd in Prayer to the Lord: First, for Patience in thy Trouble. Secondly, For Comfort in thine Affliction. Thirdly, For Strength in Weakness. Fourthly, For Deliverance at his Pleasure: Yea, endeavour to Die Praying. When thou art in the depth of Miseries, and at the Gates of Death, there is a depth of God's Mercy, which is ready to hear and help thee. Misery must call upon Mercy.</P>
<P>Be willing and ready to depart out of this World without murmuring or repining, when∣soever, wheresoever, or howsoever it <HI>shall</HI> please the Lord to <HI>call</HI> thee. For why shouldest thou
<PB N="51" REF="002963_0124_0FE6AAAF45DC3A98"/>
unwillingly suffer a short Death that <HI>will</HI> bring thee to the Fruition of Eternal Joys? Perswade thy self, <HI>that</HI> if thou live by the Mer∣cy of God, thou shalt do <HI>well</HI>; but if thou Die, doubt not but thou shalt do better. And with a free Heart speak it, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, When thou feelest Death approaching, commend thy departing Soul into the Holy Hands of God: He gave it, to him surrender it again. So laying thy self down to sleep and rest, God shall make thee to dwell in everlast∣ing Safety. <HI>The Grave is ready for me.</HI></P>
<P>A good Life <HI>till</HI> Death, and a good Death after a good Life, are the best means to attain an eternal happy Life in Heaven. As Death leaveth thee, so <HI>shall</HI> Judgment find thee. <HI>Christ is to me both in Life and Death advantage.</HI></P>

Thou saidst moreover, That God would be pleased to make me happy: whereunto I likewise answered, That I had <HI>ne∣ver</HI> been unhappy; for I am fully resolved (thro' his Grace) to adhere and cleave unto the Will of God, (abandoning mine own Will) into which I have so <HI>wholly</HI> poured out my <HI>Will, that</HI> whatsoever he <HI>will,</HI> I may <HI>will</HI> the same; and for <HI>this</HI> Cause, as <HI>I</HI> said, I was <HI>never</HI> unhappy being <HI>that</HI> I will cleave to his <HI>Will</HI> only, and have <HI>wholly</HI> resigned mine own proper <HI>Will.</HI></P>
