<P>THERE is not a single Pamphlet, written in North-America, that does not, by some Accident, or other, find its Way, to England. At a Time, when the English News-papers, may probably, be filled with Equipments of Fleets, Embarkations of Armies, &amp;c. the dullest Composition, relating to the Affairs of this Country, will be read there, with Avidity. The Author has therefore thought it proper, to subjoin here, and there, a Note, for the Infor∣mation, of his English Readers. He has occasionally quoted, a few Scraps of Latin, not because, like Panurge, he chooses to speak any Language, ra∣ther than his Mother Tongue; for he abhors Pedantry and Affectation of every Kind: But partly from his dread∣ful
<PB N="iv" REF="014359_0004_0F91EC7A975432D0"/>
Apprehension of the Tarrers, and Featherers, of the Country, in which he resides; none of whom, he is well assured, were ever bred, at a Latin School: And partly, from Respect, to the female Part of his Readers, for whose Innocence. and Modesty, he has a sacred Regard. At the same Time, left, while the latter acquit his Man∣ners, they should think hardly, of his Morals,—he begs Leave to assure them, that Ribaldry, is unknown to that Language. The Philosophers, Poets, and Historians, with whose Names, the Men, are too prone to insult their Understandings, abounding with Ex∣pressions, which literally translated, would be too foul, for the Mouths, of the most brutal of a modern Rabble.</P>

<LG>
<L>MEN plac'd, by Chance, or sov'reign Fate,</L>
<L>In Life's low, unambitious State;</L>
<L>Whilst undeprav'd, all amply share,</L>
<L>Wise, bounteous Nature's, equal Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To them, impartial Heav'n, assign'd,</L>
<L>Contentment calm, sweet Peace of Mind,</L>
<L>Deny'd them, Fame, and Pow'r, and Wealth,</L>
<L>But gave them, Temp'rance, Mirth, and Health;</L>
<L>Preserv'd them, from the fatal Snares,</L>
<L>Which Lux'ry spreads, for Fortune's Heirs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From all the dire insidious Train,</L>
<L>Of Wants unreal, Wishes vain,</L>
<L>Refinements false, and fierce Desires,</L>
<L>Voluptuous Arts, and lawless Fires;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="014359_0006_0F91EC7C0EB54DF8"/>
Soft Blandishments, of Wealth, and Ease,</L>
<L>Which ruin, while they smile, and please</L>
<L>From childish, restless Whim, that reigns</L>
<L>In satiate Taste, and pamper'd Veins;</L>
<L>From the dire Weight, of vacant Time,</L>
<L>(That fatal Source of many a Crime;)</L>
<L>Envy of Pension, Power, and Place,</L>
<L>Vain Competition, sad Disgrace;</L>
<L>Honour, and Virtue, meanly sold</L>
<L>For Titles, Rank, or sordid Gold:</L>
<L>Corroding Cares, that constant wait</L>
<L>To check the Triumphs of the Great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Doom'd them to earn, their wholesome Fare,</L>
<L>By gentler Toils, than anxious Care:</L>
<L>Free from the Woes, Ambition brings,</L>
<L>And made them, happier far, than Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To them, our equal Laws dispense,</L>
<L>Fair Liberty, and sure Defence;</L>
<L>From Pride, from Force, and brutal Scorn</L>
<L>Of Knaves, to Power, and Fortune born:</L>
<L>Of Foplings, dainty, weak, and nice,</L>
<L>Who hold, plain Poverty as Vice.</L>

<L>They give, to every splendid Lord;</L>

<L>Dear social Parts of one great Whole;</L>
<L>Whilst undeprav'd, and just, and free,</L>

<L>The Men deprav'd, who quit their Sphere,</L>
<L>Without Remorse, or Shame, or Fear,</L>
<L>And boldly rush, they know not where;</L>
<L>Seduc'd, alass! by fond Applause,</L>
<L>Of gaping Mobs, and loud Huzzas.</L>
<L>Unconscious all, of nobler Aim,</L>
<L>Than sordid Pelf, or vulgar Fame;</L>
<L>Men undefin'd, by any Rules,</L>
<L>Ambiguous Things, half Knaves, half Fools,</L>
<L>Whom God denied, the Talents great,</L>
<L>Requir'd, to make a Knave, complete;</L>
<L>Whom Nature form'd, vile Party-Tools,</L>
<L>Absurder much, than dowright Fools,</L>
<L>Who from their own dear Puppet-Show,</L>
<L>The World's great Stage, pretend to know.</L>
<L>In Politics, mere Punchinellos,</L>
<L>Yet pass for rare, for clever Fellows;</L>
<L>Like Punch, who struts, and swears, and roars,</L>
<L>And calls his Betters, Rogues and Whores;</L>
<L>Like Punch, who speak their Prompter's Sense,</L>
<L>Like his, their pow'rful Eloquence,</L>
<L>Like his, their wond'ring Audience.</L>
<L>Poor, busy, factious, empty Things,</L>
<L>Who nothing know, of Courts or Kings;</L>
<L>Who Lords or Commons, ne'er have seen,</L>

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE PRECEDING WORK.</HEAD>
<P>[<HI>The Men deprav'd.</HI> Page 3, Line5.]</P>
<P>SEE the Names, in the Lifts of Committees, in the several Districts of North-America; and enquire, what are their Callings?</P>
<P><HI>Calls his Betters.</HI> P. 3, L. 23.] It is the Practice of these Ora∣tors, over all America, to summon the Mob, by some anonymous portentous Hand-Bill, addressed to the PUBLIC; to mount into a Gallery or elevated Station, in or near a Place of public Re∣sort; and from thence, with a grave important Face, harangue on the deplorable State of public Affairs, and the total Loss of Liberty, in a Country, which, were it not for them, would be the happiest and the freest Country in the Universe. To retail from Scraps of Party Papers, the Merits of the Leaders of Opposition; ascribe Opinions to them, which they would hear with the highest Indig∣nation; and engage for their Countenance and Support, Opini∣ons, Designs, &amp;c. as if they were as familiarly known to them, as their own Characters are to their Wives, Children, and Ser∣vants, if they happen to have any.</P>
<P>On the first Personages of Great-Britain, all the great Officers of State, and the Majority of both Houses, they liberally bestow the delicious Epithets of Jacobites, Papists, Tyrants, Hirelings and Scoundrels, amidst the repeated Shouts of their greasy Fol∣lowers.</P>
<P><HI>The Oar, the Sledge.</HI> P. 4, L. 5.] The Author could have added the Awl, the Trowel, and many other Tools; but he
<PB N="36" REF="014359_0040_0F91EC959B7CDD80"/>
thinks his Rhyme rough enough in all Conscience, as it is.—Such Tools, are as little adapted to Poetry, as to Politics.</P>
<P><HI>Hand Bills.</HI> P. 4, L. 11.] The Oracles of North-America, like the Sibyls Leaves scattered over the whole Country They have been lately collected with great Labour and Expence, digested by the Sanhedrim at Philadelphia, and compiled into a regular Code.</P>
<P>A memorable AEra in the Annals of North-America. A Code, by which the Principles of common Sense, every System of Ethics, ancient and modern, the Authority of the most cele∣brated Jurists, the Common and Statute Laws of Great-Britain, the Laws of the several Provincial Legislatures, the Authority of Provincial Magistrates, and the revealed Laws of God, are all abrogated and done away. A Code, which the gaping Vul∣gar of America thumb with the same Delight, as they con Jack the Giant Killer; which the great and little Vulgar of England will laugh over, as at the Farce of High Life below Stairs; and which every Man in Europe, of Sense and Benevolence, will read with Grief and Indignation.</P>

</LG>
<P><HI>Vipers leagu'd</HI> P. 4, L. 19.] Alluding to the Figure of a Snake, with which certain Printers of American News-Papers, adorn their Publications, designed to allure a certain Set of Customers, and to enlist a certain Crew of Writers, who have contributed in a most criminal Degree, to subvert the Laws of this Country, have already enflamed it, into the most dangerous Convulsions, and threaten to complete its final Destruction. These Standards were erected perhaps in Imitation of certain well known Signs in Blood-Bowl-Alley of London, and in la Rue D'Enfer of Paris. The Resorts of Bullies, Spies, Informers, Incendiaries, Highwaymen, and Murderers.</P>
<P>This Custom is not common to all the Publishers of News∣Papers; some of the Fraternity, equally malignant in their Designs, and more successful in their Operations, hang out no Sign at all. They are of old established Credit. Their Wine needs no Bush.</P>
<P><HI>Many a Press.</HI> P. 4, L. 23.] Not every Press; Mr. Riving∣ton, of New-York, continues to discharge the duties of his Pro∣fession faithfully, in Spite of frequent Letters from unknown Villains, threatening him with Fire, Assassination, &amp;c. in De∣fiance of many unwarrantable Associations in different Parts of America, exhorting some, and compelling others, to withdraw their Subscriptions to his useful and impartial Gazetteer, in the
<PB N="37" REF="014359_0041_0F91EC96508F8468"/>
Face of numerous Committees, who have taken the same sage Precautions to prevent the Introduction of his Publications into their respective Realms, as if they had been consign'd from Smyrna, or Aleppo, in a Time of a general Pestilence.</P>
<P>He grows bolder, by Persecution, to the Confusion of a per∣nicious Set of Scriblers, and of an envious Gang of Rivals, who constantly mark him in their News-Papers to the deluded Rabble for Destruction. The Public, is in the Author's Opinion, much obliged to him, and to the good Sense, and Liberality of the Gentlemen of all Parties in that Province, by whom he is coun∣tenanced and employed indifferently, as his Gazetteer, and his Catalogue of Pamphlets testify.</P>
<P>The Author believes there is likewise a free Press or two at Boston, defended by an Army and a Fleet, by which alone they preserve their Freedom.</P>
<P><HI>Who scowl on Wealth.</HI> P. 5, l. 27.] No Man of common Observation, who has crossed the Atlantic, can have failed to remark, the great Difference between the Manners, of the lower and middling Sort of People in England, and of People of the same Classes here. Altho' those Orders of Englishmen, are not much celebrated for their Civility. The Author, who had often be∣held in certain Countries of Europe, the miserable and abject State of that great and sacred Portion of the human Species; and had seen the insolent, and brutal Abuse of Rank, Titles, and Power, on his first Arrival in North-America, exulted in an Appearance, so honourable to Humanity; he recollected the Observation of a Philosopher, in discovering a Circle exactly de∣scrib'd on an unknown Shore, where he happened to be ship∣wrecked; and thought this as sure a Proof of general Felicity, as that of Civility and Science. Jealous tho' he is naturally of his Superiors (and his Superiors are innumerable) he begins to find he was mistaken, and to perceive that there are Pleasures, like the Pleasures of Excess, exquisite but short-lived, and ending in Disease and untimely Death.</P>
<P>These Men begin to look upon their Superiors as if the Order of the Universe had been inverted in their Favour; as if they were possessed of what naturally belonged to themselves, and were determined to seize the first Opportunity to recover it <HI>Vi et Armis.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Ye take too much upon yourselves, seeing all the Congre∣gation are holy, every one of them: Wherefore then lift you up yourselves above the Congregation of the Lord?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Their little Mantua, Rome.</HI> P. 7, L. 6.] There is a very re∣markable Difference, between the Opinions, Principles, and
<PB N="38" REF="014359_0042_0F91EC97155ECB70"/>
Conduct in general, of the Natives of this Country, who have resided in Europe, or have conversed much with Europeans, and of those who never passed the Limits of their own, or of some neighbouring province. Arts, Sciences, Knowledge, Accom∣plishments, Wealth, Power, Dignity, are all comparative. Com∣parisons are frequently mortifying in the extremest Degree to that Vanity, which is inseparable from our Nature: But without it no Man can form a true Estimate of himself, or establish a just Rule of his Conduct. However nauseous the Medicine may be, it is a salutary one. An overweening Conceit of the Importance of this Country, and a very inadequate Knowledge, or a total Ignorance of the Parent Country, are among the fatal Sources of the dreadful Calamities, at this Moment impending over a Part of this Country; may they never extend over the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Dullest Ignorance betray.</HI> P. 7, L. 7.] Ignorance of the true Nature, Conditions, and Ends of Government, and of the Application of general Doctrines, to particular Circumstances, in which they resemble certain bold Empiricks, who by admini∣stering excellent and efficacious Medicines unseasonably, and in too large Doses, throw their Patients into Convulsions, and destroy them. There are three or four Pamphlets, said to be written in America, within these twelve Months, by Gentlemen called Whigs. These Gentlemen appear by their Writings to be Men of Sense and Candour. They are Proofs, in the Author's Opinion, how frequently Men are led by Youth, Inexperience, Confinement to narrow Scenes, Want of Leisure, and general enlarged Knowledge, to form false and fatal Conclusions, from the noblest Principles. The Epidemic, may it not prove the mortal Disease, of this Country. <HI>Eslo perpetua.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Pamphlet likewise lately written by a Gentleman, who calls himself a Whig, under the Title of Strictures, very different from the former in its Design, if not in its Effect.</P>
<L>"Abominable, inutterable, and worse</L>
<L>"Than Fables yet have feign'd, or Fear conceiv'd;</L>
<L>"GORGONS, and HYDRAS, and CHIMERAS dire."</L>
<P><HI>Scriveners only meant.</HI> P. 8, L. 9.] The Author has been as∣sured, that no less than 28 of the Members of the Sanhedrim were Lawyers; he express'd Astonishment on hearing this, but on enquir∣ing, he found they were, what they call in England, Attorney at Law, his Astonishment ceased. When he recollected the Obser∣vation of the celebrated Judge Blackstone, <Q>on Gentlemen pla∣ced at the Desk of some skilful Attorney, <HI>ita lex scripta est,</HI> is the utmost his Knowledge will arrive at, he must never aspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any Argu∣ments,
<PB N="39" REF="014359_0043_0F91EC97D40ABCC0"/>
drawn <HI>a priori</HI> from the Spirit of the Laws, and the Na∣tural Foundations of Justice.</Q> In the same Page, he admits one or two shining Exceptions in all Great-Britain; how many he might admit here, the Author is no Judge. By the abuse of cer∣tain Words of an ill Sound, much debated about in this Coun∣try, he is afraid there are many among them, who are not well acquainted even with <HI>Lex scripta,</HI> nor much versed in English Dictionaries.</P>
<P><HI>Shawanese.</HI> P. 12, L. 22.] A Tribe of North-American In∣dians. The Americans wish to live in populous Towns, or cul∣tivated Countries, to have Manufactures to cloath them, or Mo∣ney to buy cloaths, their regular Meals, good Beds to lie on; to be protected from foreign and domestic Violence, to their own Persons and Property, and to the Persons of their Wives and Children, without paying for it. To have their Injuries redres∣sed without the Risk of shedding their own blood, and to enjoy, at the same Time, the native unrestrained Freedom of a Savage. They are not contented with being Men. "Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods!"</P>
<P><HI>As wise as Machiavel.</HI> P. 12, L. 31.] The Gentlemen of the Sanhedrim have acted in direct contradiction to the first Maxim of that extraordinary Man, "never to do any Thing by Halves." They have employed his flagitious, and atrocious Means, wantonly, and without remorse, with as much Ferocity as Caesar Borgia, his Hero, but without regard to his Ends.</P>
<P><HI>As well as Barnet.</HI> P. 13. L. 12.] Doctor Barnet, Master of Eton College, very generally respected, both on Account of his examplary Virtues as a Man, and of his uncommon Attention and Kindness to his Scholars as a Master. His Scholars were much more numerous than they had even been known to be under the Direction of any of his Predecessors.</P>
<P><HI>Dormer's Arms,</HI> P. 13. L. 17.] A noted Inn, on the River Thames, some Miles distant from Eton; their usual Rendez∣vous, when the Boys rebel and run from the College.</P>
<P><HI>York.</HI> P. 14. L. 23.] A very genteel, good natured, sensible, generous, young Gentleman; once a great favourite, and on his Part, very fond of Doctor Barnet; but had lately taken a Pique to him, was continually pouting, and had grown very refractory. The Doctor, it seems, had given Orders, that for the future, no Scholar, should deal with Mother Bat, the Apple-Woman. She had been detected in bringing the Boys by Stealth, Brandy, and Rum, to make Punch, the Commodities of the green Cannister, Serpents, Crackers, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which were absolutely forbidden by the Rules of the College.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="014359_0044_0F91EC988D906980"/>As Goody Brit who was recommended by the Doctor in her Room, was a very decent Woman, who scorn'd to get her Live∣lihood in any Way, but an honest one. She could not afford to sell quite so cheap as Mother Bat. Poor York was very much nettled at these Orders, for he was a very kind hearted Boy, and used to lay out a great Deal of Money upon Oranges and Cheese∣cakes, &amp;c. to treat his Comrades, Moreover Mother Bat hap∣pened to be a near Relation of his Gradmamma: However, he never would have join'd the Scholars if he had not been afraid of the great Boys: He was forgiven upon Condition, that for the fu∣ture, when he thought himself ill-treated by the Praepostors or Ser∣vants, he would come and tell his Complaints to the Doctor, and not run up and down as he used to do, telling Stories against him to all the Bargemen, Coblers, Tinkers, Blacksmiths, News∣paper Carriers, Pedlars, &amp;c. of the Parish.</P>
<P><HI>Penn.</HI> P. 14. L. 23.] A Descendant of an illegitimate Son of Admiral Penn, who with Venables conquered the Island of Jamaica. His paternal Relations, according to the benevolent Spirit of their virtuous Ancestor, the celebrated Legislator of Pennsylvania, treated him with as much Kindness, as if he had been legally descended; he was (not long ago) the very best Boy of the College, a plain, modest, amiable, sweet temper∣ed Youth; so very innoffensive in his Behaviour, that he was never known to Quarrel with any Body, for he had often heard his Relations, who were excellent examplary Men, remark, that it was preposterous and horrible for Creatures who pretended to be Rational, to be one Moment bowing, scraping, cringing, and flattering, and the next, damning one anothers Bloods for Scoundrels, knocking each others Eyes out, and running one another thro' the Body, for every Trifle. It is said, however, that he is of late very much altered, by keeping Company with Vir. Car. Mar. and Mass. and by the Conversation, during the Holidays, of some Foreign Merchants, ho frequent his Uncles House upon Business, and is grown a Fop, Swears, Drinks, Bullies, and talks of Duels, &amp;c. to the extreme Grief of his ve∣nerable Relations. However, as early Impressions are not easily wholly effaced, it is hoped a little gentle Correction, and his Un∣cle's Remonstrances, may have reclaimed him. His Pique to the Doctor, was for much the same Reason as York's, excepting, that he was not related to Mother Bat; he was uncommonly tall for his Age, of which he was not a little Vain, and would mutter now and then, that the Doctor durst not touch a Hair of his Head, he was a Match for the old Fellow.</P>
<P><HI>Car. Vir. Mar.</HI> P. 14. L. 24] All of them much alike,
<PB N="41" REF="014359_0045_0F91EC995AEC41F8"/>
very acoomplished, sprightly, sensible Lads, but the sauciest Boys of the whole College, as proud as Lucifer. They were nicknamed by the Rest of the Scholars, your Honour, your Grace, your Majesty. They had been accustomed from their Infancy to wear tawdry Cloaths, to ride in Coaches and fix, to eat and drink what they liked, to be waited upon by a great Number of Servants, whom they saw every Day goaded like Oxen, and beat like Dogs. At College they were pert and idle, and of course much disliked by the Doctor. They were hated by the Dames where they lodged, for they used to D—n her for an old B—h, because she did not cure her Bacon with Salt Petre, and put Cinnamon and Mace into her minc'd Pyes. Their Holy∣days were spent at Sadler's Wells, Mary-Bone Gardens, Taverns, and B—w—y House, where they hectored and swore like the Bellies of the House. At College they distinguished themselves by robbing the Ban-Yards, Quarrelling with the Barge-Men, Forming a Maccaroni Club, Gaming, Drinking, Whoring and talking of New-Market Meetings. Several Reasons were given for their running from the College. They were in Debt to all the Public Houses, B—w—y Houses, Shopkeepers, Taylors, Pastry Cooks, and Fruit Shops at Windsor: Car. took a Pique to the Usher, and stole behind him one Day as he was going into the School, and with a Piece of blue Crayon slily marked on his Back, R. T. in Capital Letters, to the great Diversion of all the Boys, especially of Mass. Con. Ham. and Rhode; another Time he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the Doctor's Kitchen, and while the Cook was winding up the Jack, threw a Paper of Jallop into a Rice Pud∣ing, a Servant who happened to pass by the Kitchen Window, observing what he was about, informed the Doctor, who invited him to Dine with him that Day, gravely recommended to him a Slice of the Pudding, and sent him to his Dames, with a horrible Fit of the Gripes. Vir. was obliged to run off: His Master it seems, had threatened to Flog him for some Fault or another, if he did not mend his Manners; upon which he had the Impudence to throw a Chaw of Tobacco in his Face, take to his Heels, and call to the Boys to follow him. These young Gentlemen would have been all expelled, if some of their very near Relations, well known to the Doctor, and highly respected by him, as they well deserved to be, had not interecded for him; telling the Doctor, it was pitty to ruin the poor Lads utterly for a few boyish Tricks, which Age and Reflection might make them ashamed of after very severe Correction, and begging hard for Forgiveness, they were permitted to remain at College.</P>

of these Boys will serve for a Description of the rest. They are among the oldest Boys of the School. Their Fathers being often at Sea, or constantly employed in their Farms, had left them in the earlier, Parts of their Life, to the Care and Tuition of their Grand∣mothers, and maiden Aunts, who made them read, every Morn∣ing and Evening, some select Chapters of the Old Testament; entertained them in the Winter Evenings, with Stories of the Bloody Queen Mary, the Gun Powder Plot, the Irish Massacre, the Act of Uniformity, &amp;c. Told them what a wicked pro∣fane Monster Charles the first was, to let People fetch a Walk, Play at Cricket, and go a Skaiting on the Sabbath. Made him read Prynne's Histrio Mastic, Killing no Murder, &amp;c. Repeated to him the crying Sin of Fornication, Swearing, and taking the Lord's Name in Vain, made him get by Heart, how Mr. Pride, the Drayman, Mr. Hewson, the Cobler, came to be Colonels, Mr. Praise God Bare bones, the Felmonger, a Member of Par∣liament, and Farmer Cromwell, of the Isle of Ely, Lord High Protector of Great-Britain and Ireland. They led him to Church every Sabbath, where he spent five Hours twice a Day, hearing the Minister preach about David's Rebellion against Saul. About Agag, and the Amalakites. Binding Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of Iron. The glorious Atchievements of Joshua, at the Seige and Surrender of Jericho, the Priests of Baal, &amp;c. Their Fathers were a sagacious Sort of Men, and hearing that Boys sometimes made Acquaintances at Eton, that proved very Ad∣vantageous to them when they engaged in Business and the World; sent them there contrary to the Customs of their Ance∣stors, and of their Relations. These Boys did not appear to be so bad as Car. Vir. and Mar. but some how or other, they were much less beloved by the whole College. They rarely mix'd with the rest of the Boys, if they did, it was only to set them against the Doctor, calling him a cruel, abominable Tyrant; that he design'd to give them harder Tasks, flog them more than ever, and keep them at Eton, all the Holidays. If a Boy happened to take the Lord's Name in Vain, they would give him a Knock in the Face, and tell him the D—l would carry him to Hell in his Sleep. They never play'd at Cricket, Fives, Leap Frog, or any other Game with the rest. When they bought Apples, they stole into a Corner, and eat them by them∣selves; if they saw any of the Youngsters with an Orange, or a Cheese-cake, they would snatch it out of his Hand, vow it was theirs, that they had stolen it out of their Pockets; if they dared to complain, they gave him a Kick on the Breech, bid him go and complain to the Doctor, they did not care a F—t, for the Doctor, the Doctor might Kiss their A—es.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="014359_0047_0F91EC9AD9252240"/>These Boys would have been infallibly expell'd, but they had a great Number of very near Relations, very unlike themselves; to whom the Doctor had the highest Obligations, who con∣demned their undutiful Behaviour, as much at least, as himself. They had been confin'd several Months to their Chambers, to hard Study, when the Author last heard of them; and were not to be released, till they had publickly acknowledged their Faults on their bare Knees, asked the Doctor's forgiveness; solemnly promised to be good Boys for the future, and received a very se∣vere and exemplary Flogging.</P>
<P>There was at the College, a young Gentleman of the Name of Can. the only Scholar of any Consequence, who was not in∣vited to the Dormer's Arms, because they knew it would have been to no purpose. Can. was a very polite, good natur'd, sprightly young Cavalier, danc'd the best Minuet of any Boy in the School, had rode the great Horse, very brave, and an excellent Fencer; he had lately been remov'd from another public School, where he had been very hardly used, seldom had his Belly full, was flogg'd unmercifully by the Master, Ushers, and Praeposters, for the slightest Fault of Mistake, and kick'd and cuff'd about by all the Servants of the College; of whom he never durst complain, for fear of worse Treatment. Finding this to very different from the School he had left, he conceiv'd a great Affection and reverence for Doctor Barnet, and behaved so modestly, and dutifully, that there never was a single Complaint against him. Can was much liked by the Boys who were acquainted with him, always chear∣ful and obliging, laughing, singing and dancing, never com∣plaining. If at any Time Marid'eve, Malagorge, Navire-gage, Dickfils, Oyseau-blue, Temps, cuilier, or any other of the discon∣tented Boys, began to insinuate any Things in a round-about-way, against the Doctor, his Ushers, or Praeposters, or the Rules of the College. It was a Sort of Gibberish he had never been used to, he would stare, shake his Head, shrug up his Shoulders, Mutter. Nontong Pau, Comprong, rieng, de tob Sla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Along, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. If Mass spoke out and call'd the Doctor Tyrant, and the Ushers Scoundrels in plain Terms, he fell in a furious Passion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Friatre, Osetú B—g—e, Sacre Bleu, Ventre Bleu, and kick'd 'em and cuff'd 'em like a Mad-man. At last they let him alone, flatter'd him always to his Face, and abus'd him behind his Back; for he had given many of them a black Eye, and they were more afraid of him, than of the Doctor, Ushers, Proepostors and Servants, all joined in a Body.</P>

only: in the rest invincible. No Man who has read the Citizen of Hobbes, the Decrees of Oxford, the wretched Shifts that Bishop Burnet had recourse to, in order to accommodate the Doctrines of his Church, to the Revolution, or the Bungling of the learned Grotius in endeavouring to reconcile capital Punish∣ments, War, and Resistance, with the Meekness of the Gospel. No Man of Candour and good Will, can wonder at, or be angry with, the Author of the Friendly Address. It is one of the sad Effects of such Times as these, to force Men of certain Tempers to fly for Refuge into the gloomy Regions of Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance. This was the Case of Hobbes, and of the University of Oxford, of many other Men, and of Bodies of Men, possessed of too much Benevolence, Virtue, Learning, and Abilities, to be treated with petulant or arrogant Contempt. Such Men fly from Anarchy into these dismal but peaceful Re∣treats; they do not wish to remain there. Under a James the Second, Oxford, and others retracted.</P>

to a certain favourite Study, became so disorder'd, that his Ideas of Right and Wrong, and of the most common Inconve∣niencies, Accidents and Occurrences of Life, were wholly un∣like those of other Men. He had been many years a Member of a very respectable Club, and was as much esteemed by his Brother Members, and treated with as much Kindness, as any Man. From the Moment that he was seized with this strange, fatal Delirium, he became another Sort of Man, always dis∣contented, for ever complaining, that he was shov'd down to the lower End of the Table, had not his Share of Fat, could not get a Bit of the Green, &amp;c. that they were always plotting against him, at the Upper-end of the Table: That they con∣stantly took Advantage of his occasional Absence, and never waited for his Consent, when they made any new Rules for the Club. When the Reckoning was called for, he would throw down a Half-penny, and swear till he was black in the Face, that it was as good a Guinea, as ever came from the Mint. He would take a common Farmer for a Field-Marshal, a Plowman for a Lieutenant General, a Set of Puppets for Ministers States∣men, and Kings; a Wind-mill for some blood-thirsty gigantic Tyrant, and a Flock of harmless Animals, for an Army of the Enemy. He constantly mistook his Friends for his Foes, and his Foes for his Friends; herded with the lowest and vilest of the Rabble, and shunned the Society of his old Companions, the Clergyman of the parish, his Neighbour the Gentlemen Farmer, Squire Question, Squire Tensi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and others, with whom he had formerly lived very happily, and in great Intimacy; who sincerely lamented his strange Delusion, and spared no Pains to divert him from the Study of those absurd Romances, which had been the fatal Cause of it; such as the Works of Don Malagorge, Don Poulecoq, Don Dicksfils, Don Obispo Naviregage, and above all the fabulous and monstrous History of the Reign and Achiev∣ments of Sincantrois frequently expostulating with him in the most affectionate Terms, and warning him if he persisted in it, that he would infailibly beggar himself, his Family, and Rela∣tions, not in a jail, come to be hanged, or die under a Hedge, in return for their friendly Advice, he called them a Pack of Scoundrels, Liars, Pickpockets, Sycophants and Traitors, and swore they had been bribed to ruin him by Don Jorgé, a noble Duke, of whom he held his Estate, by the Tenure of Fealty and Homage. Every Body remembers how he took up his Lodgings one Night at a Hedge Alehouse, and thought himself in a Mag∣nificent Castle, dreamt that he was attacked by a furious Giant, jumpt out of Bed, ran to his Sword, attacked a Hogshead of

Red Wine, broached the Hogshead, and let out all the Wine about the Chamber, and on the Landlord's insisting upon being paid for his Wine, laughed at him for a Blockhead, swore it was the Blood of a Giant, whom he had Slain in Defence of him and his Castle, damned him for an insolent ungrateful Scoundrel, and threatened to cut his Ears off.</P>
<P>It is well known likewise, how he put to flight all the Ma∣gistrates of the District, released a Gang of Thieves, Pick∣pockets, Highway-men and Murderers, and let them loose upon the industrious, innocent, Inhabitants; how they fell upon their Deliverer, and how he narrowly escaped with his Life.</P>
