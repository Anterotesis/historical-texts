<HEAD><HI>Several REASONS</HI> Proving that Inoculating or Transplanting the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> is a Lawful Practice, and that it has been Blessed by GOD for the Saving of many a Life.</HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>It has been Questioned, Whether <HI>Inoculating</HI> the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be a Lawful Practice. I incline to the Affirmative, for these Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. BEcause I have read, that in <HI>Smyrna, Con∣stantinople,</HI> and other Places, Thousands of Lives have been saved by Inoculation, and not one of Thousands has miscarried by it. This is related by Wise &amp; Learned Men who would not have imposed on the World a false Nar∣rative. Which also has been published by the <HI>Royal Society</HI>; therefore a great Regard is due to it.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE hear that several <HI>Physicians</HI> have Recom∣mended the Practice hereof to His <HI>Majesty,</HI> as a Means to preserve the Lives of his Subjects, and that His Wise and Excellent <HI>Majesty King GEORGE,</HI> as also his <HI>Royal Highness</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> have approved hereof, and that it is now coming into practice in the Nation. In one of the Publick Prints are these Words, <Q>Inoculating the Small Pox is a safe and universally Useful Experiment.</Q> Several Worthy Persons lately arrived from <HI>England</HI> inform us, that it is a successful Practice there: If Wise &amp; Learn∣ed Men in <HI>England,</HI> declare their Approbation of this <HI>Practice,</HI> for us to declare our Disapprobation will not be for our Honour.</P>
<P N="3">III. GOD has graciously owned the <HI>Practice of Ino∣culation,</HI> among us in <HI>Boston,</HI> where some Scores, yea above an hundred have been <HI>Inoculated,</HI> &amp; not one mis∣carried: but they Bless GOD, for His discovering this Experiment to them. It has been objected, that one that was Inoculated, died, viz. Mrs. <HI>D—ll:</HI> but she had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> in the common way before, &amp; her Friends and nearest Relations declare that she re∣ceived no hurt by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> but was by a fright put into Fits that caused her Death. It is then a wonderful Providence of GOD, that all that were <HI>Inoculated</HI> should have their Lives preserved; so that the Safety and Usefulness of this Experiment is confirmed to us by Ocular Demonstration: I con∣fess I am afraid, that the Discouraging of this Practice, may cause many a Life to be lost, which for my own part, I should be loth to have any hand in, <HI>because of the Sixth Commandment.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. IT cannot be denied but that some Wise and Judicious Persons among us, approve of Inoculation, both <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI>; Among Ministers I am One, who have been a poor Preacher of the Gospel in <HI>Boston</HI> above Threescore Years, and am the most Aged, Weak and unworthy Minister now in <HI>New-England.</HI> My Sentiments, and my Son's also, about this <HI>Matter</HI> are well known. Also we hear that the Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>Solomon Stoddard</HI> of <HI>Northampton</HI> concuts with us; so doth the Reverend Mr. <HI>Wise</HI> of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and many other younger Divines, not only in <HI>Boston,</HI> but in the Country, joyn with their Fathers. Furthermore, I have made some Enquiry, Whether there are many Persons of a Prophane Life and Conversa∣tion, that do Approve and Defend <HI>Inoculation,</HI> and I have been answered, that they know but of very few such. This is to me a weighty Conside∣ration. But on the other hand, tho' there are some Worthy Persons, that are not clear about it; never∣theless, it cannot be denied, but that the known Children of the Wicked one, are generally fierce Enemies to Inoculation. It is a grave saying of Old <HI>Seneca, Pessimi Argumentum Turba est.</HI> For my part I should be ashamed to joyn with such Persons; <HI>O my Soul come not thou into their Secret, unto their Assembly be not thou United.</HI> I am far from reflecting upon all that are against <HI>Inoculation.</HI> I know there are very worthy Persons (with whom I desire to Live and Die) that are not clear in their Judgments for it, and they are greatly to be com∣mended and honoured in that they will not act against a doubting Conscience; yet it may be some of them might change their minds, if they would advise with those who are best able to afford them Scripture Light in this as well as in other Cases of Conscience.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 20. 1721.</P>
<P>That the Cause may have Two Witnesses, here are subjoyn∣ed the Sentiments of another, well known in our Churches, of which I declare my hearty Approbation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="sentiments">
<HEAD>Sentiments on the Small Pox Inoculated.</HEAD>
<P>A most Successful, and Allowable Method of pre∣venting <HI>Death,</HI> and many other grievous Mise∣ries, by the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> is not only <HI>Lawful</HI> but a <HI>Duty,</HI> to be used by those who apprehend their Lives imme∣diately endanger'd by the terrible Distemper.</P>
<P>But the Method of managing and governing the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the way of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> is a most suc∣cessful and allowable Method of preventing <HI>Death,</HI> and many other grievous Miseries by this dreadful Distemper. Therefore, 'tis not only <HI>Lawful,</HI> but also
<PB N="2" REF="002258_0002_0FDADE9AC8403690"/>
a <HI>Duty</HI> to make use of it. None but very foolish, and very wicked People will deny the <HI>Proposition</HI> in this Argument; The <HI>Assumption</HI> is all that is disputed. But now, That this is a most <HI>Successful</HI> Method we have all the Evidence that Humane Reason can ask for.</P>
<P>Men of Honour, and Learning, and Incontestible Veracity, not one or two, but a considerable Number of them, agree in the Relation they give us, of it's being used with <HI>constant Success</HI> in the <HI>Levant.</HI> It has been used upon vast Multitudes, even many Thousands, and for some Scores of Years: And when regularly used, it yet appears not, that ever <HI>one Person</HI> miscar∣ried of it, or had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after it. We have sufficient Proofs that it is a <HI>growing Practice</HI> in those Countries. If it had been unsuccessful, or been at∣tended with bad Consequences, it must needs have been put out of Countenance, and have ceased long ago. Such Testimonies on the other side, as our People have been frighted withal, are not worth a Strate. No Man of sense that considers them can lay weight upon them: <HI>Ask us not, why we say so!</HI></P>
<P>And we have an Army of <HI>Africans</HI> among our selves, who have themselves been under it, and given us all the Assurance, which a Rational Mind can desire, that it has long been used with the like Success in <HI>Africa.</HI> Yea, <HI>Behold, ye yourselves have seen it.</HI> The Ope∣ration has been performed on an Hundred &amp; more, in the Town of <HI>Boston</HI>: And not one of them has miscarried: They have every one of them hitherto done well. They all give Thanks to our Merciful Redeemer for leading them into it. They would every one of them rather undergo it again, and many times over, than suffer the <HI>Small Pox</HI> as People ordinarily suffer it in the common way of Infection. The Story of <HI>one</HI> Dying after it, is trump'd up with so much folly and falshood, that it is unworthy to have any Answer given to it. In fine; Experience has declared, that there never was a more <HI>unfailing Remedy</HI> employed among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>That this is an <HI>Allowable</HI> Method, is plain; Because there can be no Objection brought against it, but what will also lie against the use of almost all the <HI>preventing Physick,</HI> that is used in the World. The Objector must maintain, That it is unlawful for a Man, who would preserve his Life and Health, to <HI>make himself Sick</HI> in a way that constantly tends to Preservation. But a very Familiar Case will so il∣lustrate the Matter, as to put it beyond all Dispute. <HI>Suppose,</HI> There is a <HI>Bloody Flux</HI> prevailing in the Town where I live, which proves Mortal to a great part of them that have it; many more than Four Hundred perish by it in a Month. A Physician is Master of a <HI>Purge</HI>; which whosoever takes it, is in an ordinary way, delivered from the danger of that Mortal Distemper. An <HI>Artificial Purge</HI> seasonably taken saves him from Death by the <HI>Natural Purge,</HI> which he is exposed unto. Will any scruple the taking of this <HI>Artificial Purge</HI>? Surely, None but such as want a Purge of <HI>Hellebore</HI> Here the Man <HI>makes Himself Sick,</HI> while He is well: and thinks that he is not <HI>the whole who has no need of a Physician,</HI> while he has the <HI>Humours</HI> in him which render him obnoxious to a <HI>Deadly Sickness.</HI> He won't think it his Duty to stay till God send the Sickness in <HI>another way</HI> upon him; when it will be too late for him to seek relief; But he will give Thanks to GOD for teaching him, how to <HI>make himself Sick,</HI> in a way that will save his Life, He most properly <HI>takes GOD's Time to fall Sick</HI>: He does it seasonably, and in the <HI>Time</HI> when GOD has <HI>commanded</HI> him to do it.</P>
<P>Many Good People, who are sensible how weak their own Iudgments are, will for a <HI>Case of Conscience</HI> be much assisted by the Judgments of the most able Di∣vines in the Country. Now every Body knows how <HI>they</HI> concur in their approbation of this Practice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Design</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> (evidently of no good Original) with which the fierce opposition to this Practice is carried on will also go a great way towards determin∣ing of Good People in Favour of it. The <HI>Conclusion</HI> will be Victorious; That when People have their Lives endangered by the <HI>Small Pox</HI> hovering about them, they not only <HI>may</HI> use the Method of Inoculation, to save their Lives, but they even <HI>ought to do it,</HI> if they can. They keep not in good Terms with the <HI>Sixth Commandment,</HI> if they do it not.</P>

<HEAD>INFERENCES.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> HEnce the Physicians may do well to beware, of going too far, and of taking wrong steps, for the frighting of People from this Practice, lest they Una∣wares have <HI>more to answer for</HI> than Men of their Profession should be willing to.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Hence, the <HI>Parents,</HI> and <HI>Masters,</HI> and <HI>Husbands</HI> and <HI>Wives,</HI> whose Relatives have beg'd as for their Lives, that they might have leave to save their Lives, by this Method, should not by their obstinate Violence hinder them from it, least on the <HI>Loss of their Lives</HI> they have sad matter of Reflection left unto them.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Hence, a People will do well, not to be too hasty in Resolves, that should forbid their Neighbours, to do what God has made their <HI>Duty</HI> for the Preservation of their Lives in this Method; lest they do in Effect <HI>forbid Obedience to the Sixth Commandment.</HI> Especially, when the Bugbear of the <HI>Pestilential Con∣sequences,</HI> is a <HI>Falshood,</HI> that has not the least shadow of <HI>Reason</HI> for it, and has the <HI>Experience</HI> of all the Countries under Heaven, where they use the <HI>Inocu∣lation,</HI> to confute it. Nor has it ever been known of Later Ages, that the <HI>Plague</HI> ever began any where but in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> from whence it has always been brought unto the Western World. And when the <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Prince,</HI> and most Eminent Physicians in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> and elsewhere, have declared their Ap∣probation of it; it seems not much for our Honour, to declare that we disapprove it.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Hence to Rave, and Rail with such bitter <HI>Exe∣crations,</HI> as are too commonly used, against the <HI>Ministers,</HI> and other serious <HI>Christians,</HI> who favour this Practice, is a very crying Iniquity; and to call it a <HI>Work of the Devil,</HI> and a <HI>going to the Devil,</HI> is a shocking <HI>Blasphemy</HI>; and much more likely to bring the <HI>Plague</HI> among us, than the Practice, which they so ignorantly and maliciously do charge with such Imagi∣nary Consequences.</P>
