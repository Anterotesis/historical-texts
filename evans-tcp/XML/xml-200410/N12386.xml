<HEAD>PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS several persons, inhabitants of the United States of America, influenced by inimical motives, intimidated by the threats of the enemy, or deluded by a Proclamation, issued the 30th of November last by Lord and General Howe, stiled the King's Com∣missioners for granting pardons▪ &amp;c. (now at open war and invading these States) have been so lost to the interest and welfare of their country, as to repair to the enemy, sign a declaration of fidelity, and, in some instances, have been compelled to take oaths of allegiance and to engage not to take up arms, or encourage others so to do, against the King of Great-Britain. And Whereas it has become necessary to distinguish between the friends of America and those of Great-Britain, inhabitants of these States; and that every man who receives a pro¦tection from and is a subject of any State, (not being conscientiously scrupulous against bearin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arms▪ should stand ready to defend the same against every hostile invasion. I do therefore in behalf of the United States, by virtue of the powers committed to me by Congress, hereby strictly command and require every person, having subscribed such declaration, taken such oaths, and accepted protection and certificates from Lord or General Howe, or any person acting under their authority, forthwith to repair to Head-Quarters, or to the quarters of the nearest general officer of the Continental army or militia, (until further provision can be made by the civil authority) and there deliver up such protections, certificates, and passports, and take the oath of allegiance to the United States of America. Nevertheless, hereby granting full liberty to all such as prefer the interest and protection of Great-Britain to the freedom and happiness of their country, forth∣with to withdraw themselves and families within the enemies lines. And I do hereby declare that all and every person who may neglect or refuse to comply with this order within thirty days from the date hereof, will be deemed adherents to the King of Great-Britain, and treated as common enemies of the American States.</P>
