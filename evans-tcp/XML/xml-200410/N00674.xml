Do give a Beaver Skin.</P>
<P>We also by the present joy of our minds quite remove our late Confusions, and compose our thoughts into such order as to be fit to enjoy our former Tranquility; and in this quiet of mind we purifie our selves from the stain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Blood, that have been shed during the War, in all our habitations. And in this calmness of Spirit we renew our rejoycings, and heartily congratulate our great Brother, and his Ladies safe arrival over the great Sea, with the joyful Account of the long wished for Peace, but cannot but be concerned that so great a joy should be attended with an Indisposition in our great Brothers Body, which we perceive he has, that does in some measure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loud our gladness. We give nine Beaver Skins.</P>

masters of our own Land, especially since we are in one Covenant Chain, and ought not to wrong one another; We therefore most Instantly renew our request that the said Paper or Writing which hath created such a mistake, may be burnt. Do give two Bevers.</P>
<P><HI>Sadeganacktie,</HI> Sachim of <HI>Onnondage,</HI> rose up, and said, <HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI></P>
<P>We have deliberately Consulted one with another what is to be offered to our great Brother, in the behalf of the Brethren of the five Nations, which I am appointed to speak.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> Coll. <HI>Peter Schuyler,</HI> Major <HI>Derik Wessels</HI> and Dom. <HI>Delli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> Who are Lovers of our welfare, by your Command did acquaint us with the Peace concluded between our great King of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, with which we are pleased, and do accept of the same. And then directing his discourse to the Clerk, said, Secretary <HI>Livingston,</HI> pray be careful, observe well, and write what we say.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> we cannot but observe to you a thing very strange, that after the conclusion of such a Peace, we are forced to tell you, that since the same was notifyed to us, we have lost Ninety four men; We, since we had the tiding of the Peace, have lain still &amp; quiet, without giving the least Off∣ence to our late Enemy, keeping the same firmly as we have always done the Covenant C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n▪ but on the contrary, the <HI>French Indians,</HI> our late Enemy, have Violated the said Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and have killed our People; and we acquaint you with this action, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g you to take it into your hearty Consideration, for ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pendance is only upon you; yet we are dayly in great Terrour, and very une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie▪ whilst we stay here our Wives and Children being daily Ex∣posed to fresh assaults of the <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haes,</HI> and other <HI>French Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Now great Brother, We will cease talking any more of that ungrateful Subject, &amp; confine our selves to the antient beginning of the Covenant Chain.</P>
<P>In the times of old there came a Ship into this Country in which there was one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who brought in the same great Plenty of Goods, with whom we entered into a strict Allyance, and tyed his Ship with the bark of a Tree, which was often Renewed until at length we changed the bark of the Tree which kept our Allyance firm, and made it of a more substantial matter, by which it became a Covenant Chain, which is the Term we have ever since used, and in this Covenant Chain we and the Brethren have been continually Linked, and have fixed it so sure, that we have never since with-drawn our hands from it, and we the five Nations shall never depart from it, but keep the same Inviolable.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> All our Confidence is and we are well assured that our great Brother will take our whole House under his Protection, in which Con∣fidence we have great joy, the like having been our Comfort in former times, and Coll. <HI>Peter Schuyler</HI> hath been always the Instrument that hath been im∣ployed for the assuring to us this Comfort. We cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>get that our Neigh∣bours of <HI>Virginia, Maryland, New England,</HI> and all the rest of our great Kings Subjects upon this main Continent of <HI>America,</HI> have often desired, and have been accordingly Linked into this Covenant Chain, which remains no longer to be Iron, but is now become Silver, and now shines with a greater Lustre and brightness than ever; and now all of us sit under the shadow of that great Tree, which is full of Leaves, and whose Roots and Branches extend not only to the Places and Houses where we Reside, but also unto the utmost limit of our great Kings Dominion of this Continent of <HI>America,</HI> which Tree is
<PB N="5" REF="000819_0005_0FAB3FE7700628B0"/>
now become a Tree of Welfare and Peace, and our living under it for the time to come will make us Enjoy more ease, and live with greater advantage then we have done for several years past, and we therefore in the hopes of this enjoyment, Renew our old Covenant Chain under this Tree of Welfare, whilst our great Brother has the care of this Government. Then turning to the rest of the Indians, he said,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Let all of us here present, be Witnesses, and keep this Covenant Chain firm and bright.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> Let now your Protection extend unto all us, your Brethren, and be watchful that when we rest secure in the Confidence of this Peace, that no more hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t or mischief may befall us, and let Coll. <HI>Peter Schuyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jor <HI>Derick Wessels</HI> Dominie <HI>Dellius, Evert Banker, John Janse Bleeker,</HI> and Se∣cretary <HI>Rob.

Yet nevertheless if the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> should do any future hurt or mischief to the Brethren, we are resolved to keep the Covenant Chain clean, but do Expect that our great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her will take care to see Justice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one us for such hurts and injuries, as we shall thereby sustain.</P>
<P>And in Testimony of the Integrity of all our Intentions, we do hereby Vomit up all the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul and Bitterness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in our minds for or by reason of any Hurts, Mischiefs or Bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>heds that have been done us, and do afterwards wash, cleanse and Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifie our selves from all the filth that hath a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tended us therein</P>

<P>We also tell you, that we come a great way from our Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o this place, and it is a great grievance that when we break our Hatchet or our G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, we must pay an unreasonable price for the mend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of them and they not contented with that make us stay a long time before they can be mended, which does us a great deal of Prejudice, and therefore we desire that those Abuses may be remedied.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> Before I leave off I must return a matter of great weight, which will require your se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Consideration, and that is, that you would require the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> to surrender up unto us all the Prisoners they have taken from us during the late War: We must also acquaint you, that a greater evil could not have attended all of us in the five Nations, as well as the Brethren, than the suffering the French to re-settle <HI>Cadaraquie,</HI> which will always be as a Thorn in our sides, and keep us in such a continual Alarm and Watchfulness, that we shall never be able to hunt freely, whilst such a Power and Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tress is so near, not only to annoy, but in a capacity to destroy us.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren</HI> I am heartily glad that that Peace which was so glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iousl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ob∣tained by the powerful Arms of my gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, the King of <HI>England,</HI> was so agreeable unto the Brethren, and do assure you, that I will take care that the Articles thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be duely observed by the <HI>French,</HI> and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expect that the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren upon the least hurt done them by the <HI>French,</HI> will give me timely notice thereof, in order to my requiring just Satisfaction for the same, and to the end that a friendly Correspondence may be kept between the <HI>French</HI> and me, you are not to suffer any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>French</HI> Priests to abide and continue with you▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o withdraw your affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons from this place▪ b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t upon their arrival <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto any of your Castles you are forthwith to bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them hither to receive my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ections.

<P>I am sorry for the great loss the Brethren have sustained since their Intel∣ligence of the Peace, and am afraid they have not been so watchful as the Circumstances of the Brethren did require, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or they can be no Strangers that the War which the Brethren have with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Indians called <HI>Dowa∣ganhaes,</HI> is a War of a long standing, and long before the War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> broke out; so that that matter cannot be so justly charged upon the French, as upon the Brethrens own Neglect; and therefore if the Brethren have not strength and conduct sufficient for the reducing of that Nation of Indians to your own Terms, it may be then worth your Consideration to en∣deavour to make an advantagous Peace with them.</P>
<P>I am very glad that you so well remember the Original of our Covenant Chain, and that you are sensible of the advantages you have received by the firm continuance of it, and of your candid Resolution never to break or violate the same. I am also extreamly pleased with your request in desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the Pro∣tection of my great Master, the King of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> and that I will take you particularly under my Charge. It has always been the care of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> to protect the Brethren, ever since they first entered into the Covenant Chain, and as an Instance thereof did engage into the late great &amp; chargeable

<P>As to your Complaint, with relation to dearness of Goods, it is not in my power to help you, for the Peace is but just begun, and Trade not brought yet under any regular settlement, which in some little time will be done, and then the cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of your Complaint will cease of course.</P>
<P>I will give directions to the Magistrates o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Albany</HI> that the Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs, &amp; other Trades-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Town do yeild to your R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quest I will also take care that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Prisoners which belong to you, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow in <HI>Canada</HI> shall be sent for, and therefore desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you to give me a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of their Names, and what French Pri∣soners you have amongst you, you must take care to send here, in order to their Return home, according to the Articles of Peace.</P>
<P>I am strangely surprized that you seem concern'd that <HI>Cadar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quie</HI> is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the <HI>French,</HI> and is very prejudicical to the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren, when I am informed, the said place was forced to be defe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red by the <HI>French</HI> in the be∣ginning of the War▪ and the same continued in that Condition for several years, during wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there were many Opportunities for the demol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hing of it, and rendring it uncapable either of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettlemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or of hurting the Bre∣thren; how the same came to be neglected I desire to know, for I cannot believe that any could be faithful to the King, my master, or just to your Interest that would omit so fair an opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunity of demolishing that Fort, which would have been so great an Injury to the Enemy, and so great an advantage to the Bre∣thren.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> My last advice to you, is, That you do not upon any account whatsoever take upon you to treat with the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> or enter into any sort of Negotiation with them, by either receiving from or sending Mes∣sages to them, for if you do that, you will then break the Covenant Chain, and the Promise you have made of continuing firm under the Obedience and Protection of the King, my great Master.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> You may judge of the great Affection the King of <HI>England</HI> my great Master, has for you, by the Richness of the Present he now makes you, so I doubt not but you will always demean your selves worthy of the Esteem my great Master has for you.

<P><HI>Father,</HI> We have lost a great many men wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin these nine years past▪ not by sickness, but by the War, when we pursued vigorously against the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI>; we have been a strong People, but pray Father behold what a small number we are reduced to by the War, however we that are left are glad to see you come sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hither.

<P><HI>Father,</HI> It is long since we and the <HI>Christians</HI> were united into such a Chain of Friendship that we did live peaceably under the Tree of welfare, planted at <HI>Skachkok,</HI> but that peaceable living was interrupted about nine years ago, by a War that broke out by the <HI>French,</HI> but n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w that War being ended, we intend to return again, and live under the Branches of that pleasant Tree of Peace, that abounds so much with Leaves, as that the Scorching heat of the Sun

<P><HI>Father,</HI> You may now perceive, how that through the Violence of the War you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children are reduced unto a very small Number, and therefore that they may recruit and become more Powerful, they are resolved to Re-plant them∣selves at their own Seat of <HI>Skachkook,</HI> where we beg your Fatherly Protection, and that our peaceable Settlement there may not be distu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b'd by the savage and brutal Inroad of our Enemies, but that the Paths leading thereunto ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be kept clean and clear from the Rovings of any Persons that may disturb us in the enjoyment of that Tranquility which will be the only means to invite other Nations of Indians to come and co-habit with us▪ increase the Number of your Children, and thereby enable us the more manfully to execute our Fathers Commands.

<P><HI>Father Corlaer</HI>▪ Now I am very sorry that I must acquaint you with an evil practice that hath continued a long time among the Brethren, and if not pre∣vented will endanger all that peaceab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e settlement we have resolved on, which is, that when our young Indians come from hunting, so soon as the Christians hear of it, they take their Horses and come to our Settlements, and there seize upon what we have got in our Canows, under pretence of being in their Debt, and not contented to take the Furze obtained in hunting but also our Guns, &amp; thereby render us unable to hunt again, by which means we become extreamly poor, and so must always run in debt for new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uns and other Necessaries to go hunt again, whereas if we had the liberty to bring our things to Market, as other Indians do, we should not only be able to pay our D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bts, but also have surplusage to supply our selves with other things needful.

<P>And since we are upon this matter, our great Brother must not be angry with us if we fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther expostulate with him, and tell him plainly and truly, that at the time of the last Invasion of the French into the <HI>Onno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dages</HI> Country, we gave our Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> the late Governour, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice that the French were preparing a great Army to invade us, &amp; required assistance to strengthen us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sist the Enemy, but it seems our Inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligence was little regarded; then when the Enemy had marched with their Canows half way to our Country, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Number of 1500 men, we sent an Express unto our Brother Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> acquainting him how far the Enemy was advanced towards the Invasion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Country, and beg'd a speedy Recruit, but without effect; &amp; as the Enemy approached nearer and nearer to our Country, we continued sending four Expresses more unto our said Brother Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> acquain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g him with the said motion of the Enemy, begging of him speedy assistance, but could not obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in the help of one man; so since we could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> depend on any a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sistance from the Brethren, and not having sufficient strength of our selves to resist so great a force of the Enemy, we shifted for our selves, desert∣ing our Castles, &amp; suffered them to be exposed to the fury of the Enemy, who after they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad burnt our Castles and destroy'd our Indian Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and done us all the mischief they could, then they return'd home with their great Army; after which retreat our Brother Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> arrived at <HI>Albany</HI> for our assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance with the great Number of 30 men instead of 500 he promised us.</P>
<P>We cannot imagine what our great Brother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when he charge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the late loss of our People upon the neglect of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r sent an Express into our Castles, and gave us notice, that the great K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of

<HI>England</HI> had concluded a Peace with the French King, and required us to for∣bear all acts of Hostility against the late Enemy which accordingly we obeyed, never imagining that the Indian Subjects of our great King should be obliged by those Articles of Peace to bury their Hatcher, and cease from doing the Enemy an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more harm, when at the same time the Indian Subjects of the French King should be permitted to hurt us: We always thought that the Hrticles of Peace made between our great King and the French King had included all the Subjects of each of their Dominions; and if this Construction be true, we had no need to be so watchful in time of Peace as in War, and therefore the late Mis∣chief done us is not to be attributed to our neglect or unwatchfulness, but un∣to the Treachery and Unfaithfulness of the French, who have not so justly observed the Articles of Peace as we have done.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> You have also charg'd us, That we should have no Treaty nor Negotiation with the French upon any matter whatsoever, nor suffer any French Priest to come &amp; abide in any of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Castles, but when any such come to bring them hither, this is very good; but for the prevention thereof, it would be very convenient that our great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should write to the Gover∣nour of <HI>Canada,</HI> prohibiting him to send any such Persons amongst us. And in answer to the Interchange of the Prisoners on both sides, we do desire, that if our great Brother have any Treaty on that matter with the French, that he give us notice thereof, that we may send some of our Sachems to be there present You seem to press earnestly that we should have no Treaty with the French, and if that we should, you will assign it to be a breach of the Cove∣nant Chain. <HI>Brother Corlaer,</HI> It is far from our thoughts to do any thing to break the Covenant Chain; we came to renew it, which we have done with greater earnestness than ever, and have planted the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee of Wellfare, which can never be rooted up; therefore be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apprehensive that we will ever break the Covenant Chain, or that we will ever treat with the French, or do any thing that may give the Brethren the least mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trust of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntegrity; for our hearts are so clean and so free from any stain or corruption, that we can never be tainted with any such evil.

And as to your complaint of the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uries done you by the People in the Town in the manner you express, I will give directions to the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or and the other Magi∣strates of <HI>Albany,</HI> that they take effectual care to prevent the like Practices for the fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, and bring your Trade and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thod of obtaining Credit under some better regulation, tho' at the same time I am informed, that many of my Children are much addicted to excessive drinking, whereby they expose them∣selves to many inconveniencies, forgetting what they then do, and so involve themselves in debt unawares, and also, after they have been abroad a hunt-they carry what they have got to other places in <HI>New-England<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and dispose thereof for D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink and often return to this place empty handed, and so by such courses bring Poverty upon themselves, I therefore exhort my Children that of all Evils they avoid that of intemperate drinking, it robbing them of their Reason, of their Health, and of the little Interest they have; and exposes them to be a prey unto every avaritious Person they have dealings with, and rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs them so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they can neither mind their hunting, nor take care fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Wives and Children; so that when they follow such courses they can e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t nothing but poverty, but if they will abstain from that Intemperance, they will have no more cause of such Complaints, they will therefore do well that whatsoever they get in hunting they bring home to this market at <HI>Albany.</HI> and then they will have the same advantages that the other Indians have▪ and make their Wives and Children live more comfortably. If my Children will follow this advice, they shall not want all due encouragement, but always have the Protection and favour of a loving Father, who will al∣ways be careful of his Children, and now links them into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Covenant Chain with the Brethren of the five Nations, in which they have always been and shall forever be preserved.

Whereupon the <HI>Praying Indians</HI> took up the Belt, and have sent it back again to us to <HI>Onnondage.</HI></P>
<P>The praying Indians of <HI>Canada,</HI> reply'd and said to the Governour of <HI>Canada, Father,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now amazed to see you decline those fair offers of Peace, it is as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
