<P>T<HI>HIS Sheet of Paper doth set before you some of the many vile and mon∣strous Doctrines, Principles, and uncharitable Sayings of the Chiefest and most Noted of your Teachers: Faithfully Collected out of their own Books, the Titles and Pages whereof are set down in the Margin: You are earnestly requested, as you regard your Eternal Salvation to consider them, and with Prayer to Almighty GOD to enable you by His Good Spirit to compare them with the Holy Scrip∣tures, by which you may clearly see that your Teachers have led you quite off from the Prin∣ciples of Christianity, without the Faith of which ye have no ground to expect Salvation. It is hoped that if you will duly and well consider these things, you will not only renounce your Teachers Errors; but gladly embrace the Doctrine and Religion of Christianity, to which you are hereby sincerely Exhorted.</HI></P>

<P><HI>From the fore-cited Quotations, it is plainly Evident that the</HI> QUAKERS <HI>Belief in these Nine Articles is as followeth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. C<HI>Oncerning their Infallibility:</HI> They affirm that they are Infallible, that God hath given to them His Attribute to Know Mens Hearts, and that they are Equal with God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Concerning the Holy Scriptures:</HI> They say that the Scriptures are Humane, and that no Command in them is in it self obliging, that what they speak is of greater Authority than the Holy Scriptures, that the Gospels of St. <HI>Matthew, Mark, Luke</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> are Dust, and the Serpents Meat, <HI>that is the Devils Meat.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Concerning the Holy Trinity:</HI> They Damn the Holy Trinity to the Pit of Hell, and call it Conjuration, af∣firming the Three Persons of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost are Three Nothings.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Concerning Christ and His Blood:</HI> They utterly de∣ny that JESUS CHRIST who suffer'd under <HI>Pontius Pi∣late,</HI> was properly the Son of God, or that we are to be saved by His Merits, but affirm that the Light which every Man brings with him into the world, is sufficient
<PB N="15" REF="001392_0014_0FB2EC77EABEE2E8"/>
for every mans Salvation without any thing else; and that the Blood of Christ is no more than the Blood of any Saint.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Concerning Baptism and the Lords Supper:</HI> They af∣firm that Baptism and the Lords Supper are no more Duties to Christians than Circumcision is, which they renounce (<HI>as they say</HI>) by the same Spirit, by which St. <HI>Paul</HI> renounced Circumcision. They call Infant-Baptism the Doctrine of Devils, and the Lords Supper the Table of Devils.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Concerning the Resurrection:</HI> They deny the Resur∣rection of the Body after Death, calling that Article of our Faith absurd as the Doctrine of Transubstantiation is.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Concerning Christs coming to Judgment:</HI> They deny the Article of Christs coming to Judgment at the end of the World, saying, That there will be no other coming of Christ, than what has been already, or that be within Men.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Concerning Heaven and Hell:</HI> They deny any other Heaven or Hell than what is within men, calling all other Mahometism.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Concerning the Lords Day, and the Moral Law:</HI> They allow doing servile Work, as opening Shop on the Lords Day, to sell Goods, and Taylers to mend Clothes on that Day; and deny that the Ten Commandments are a Rule to Christians, and especially the Eighth Com∣mandment: for a Quaker said; <HI>He had a Command im∣mediately from Heaven to take away the Priests Hour-glass;</HI> which being complain'd of, <HI>G.

For as <HI>E. Burrough</HI> their Prophet saith, <HI>Our</HI> HEIR∣SHIP <HI>it to Possess the uttermost part of the Earth,</HI> in a Declaration of the Quakers signed by <HI>E. Burrough</HI> and Fifteen more, <HI>P.</HI> 9. which is the same Principle with <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leiden,</HI> and other <HI>German</HI> Enthusiasts, That all Right to any Worldly Substance is founded on Grace, and that none had a right to any thing but the Saints.</P>
<P>The Quakers are not wronged in any one Citation, and it is left to the Judgment of all serious Christians, whether these are not the Doctrines which are con∣tained in them. All Good Christians are desired to have this Sheet in their Houses, and as they have op∣portunity, to shew the Poor Deluded Quakers their Errors, which 'tis hoped many of them do not know, and will Renounce as soon as they do.</P>
