<HEAD>M'FINGAL, AN EPIC POEM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>WHEN Yankies skill'd in martial rule,</L>
<L>First put the British troops to school;</L>
<L>Instructed them in warlike trade,</L>
<L>And new manoeuvres of parade;</L>
<L>The true war dance of Yanky-reels,</L>
<L>And val'rous exercise of heels;</L>
<L>Made them give up, like saints complete,</L>
<L>The arm of flesh and trust the feet,</L>
<L>And work, like Christians undissembling,</L>
<L>Salvation out, by fear and trembling;</L>
<L>Taught Piercy fashionable races,</L>
<L>And modern modes of Chevy-chaces:</L>
<L>From Boston, in his best aray,</L>
<L>Great Squire M'Fingal took his way,</L>
<L>And graced with Ensigns of renown,</L>
<L>Steer'd homewards to his native town.</L>

His high descent our heralds trace</L>
<L>To <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fingal, an antient Epic Poem, published as the work of Ossian, a Caledonian Bard, of the third century, by James M'Pherson, a pensioned Scotch ministerial scribbler.</NOTE> Ossian's famed Fingalian race:</L>
<L>For tho' their name some part may lack,</L>
<L>Old Fingal spelt it with a Mac;</L>
<L>Which great M'Pherson, with submission</L>
<L>We hope will add, the next edition.</L>
<L>His fathers flourish'd in the Highlands</L>
<L>Of Scotia's fog-benighted islands;</L>
<L>Whence gain'd our 'Squire two gifts by right,</L>
<L>Rebellion and the second sight</L>
<L>Of these the first in antient days</L>
<L>Had gain'd the noblest palms of praise,</L>
<L>'Gainst Kings stood forth and many a crown'd head</L>
<L>With terror of its might confounded;</L>
<L>Till rose a King with potent charm</L>
<L>His foes by goodness to disarm,</L>
<L>Whom evr'y Scot and Jacobite</L>
<L>Strait fell in love with, at first sight;</L>
<L>Whose gracious speech, with aid of pensions,</L>
<L>Hush'd down all murmurs of dissensions,</L>
<L>And with the sound of potent metal,</L>
<L>Brought all their blust'ring swarms to settle;</L>
<L>Who rain'd his ministerial mannas,</L>
<L>Till loud sedition sung hosannahs;</L>
<L>The good Lords, Bishops and the Kirk</L>
<L>United in the public work;</L>
<L>Rebellion from the northern regions,</L>
<L>With Bute and Mansfield swore allegiance;</L>
<L>And all combin'd to raze as nuisance,</L>
<L>Of church and state, the constitutions;</L>
<L>Pull down the empire, on whose ruins</L>
<L>They meant to edify their new ones;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="014528_0004_0F92FD5414397D80"/>
Enslave th' Amer'can wildernesses,</L>
<L>And tear the provinces in pieces.</L>
<L>For these our 'Squire among the vailnt'st</L>
<L>Employ'd his time and tools and talents;</L>
<L>And in their cause with manly zeal</L>
<L>Used his first virtue, to rebel;</L>
<L>And found this new rebellion pleasing</L>
<L>As his old king-destroying treason.</L>
<L>Nor less avail'd his optic sleight,</L>
<L>And Scottish gift of second-sight.</L>
<L>No antient sybil fam'd in rhyme</L>
<L>Saw deeper in the womb of time;</L>
<L>No block in old Dod<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na's grove,</L>
<L>Could ever more orac'ler prove.</L>
<L>Nor only saw he all that was,</L>
<L>But much that never came to pass;</L>
<L>Whereby all Prophets far outwent he,</L>
<L>Tho' former days produc'd a plenty:</L>
<L>For any man with half an eye,</L>
<L>What stands before him may espy,</L>
<L>But optics sharp it needs, I ween,</L>
<L>To see what is not to be seen.</L>
<L>As in the days of antient fame</L>
<L>Prophets and poets were the same,</L>
<L>And all the praise that poets gain</L>
<L>Is but for what th' invent and feign;</L>
<L>So gain'd our 'Squire his fame by seeing</L>
<L>Such things as never would have being.</L>
<L>Whence he for oracles was grown</L>
<L>The very <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tripod was a sacred three-legged stool, from which the antient priests uttered their oracles.</NOTE> tripod of his town.</L>
<L>Gazettes no sooner rose a lye in,</L>
<L>But strait he fell to prophesying;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="014528_0005_0F92FD556BF56B00"/>
Made dreadful slaughter in his course,</L>
<L>O'erthrew provincials, foot and horse;</L>
<L>Brought armies o'er by sudden pressings</L>
<L>Of Hanoverians, Swiss and Hessians;</L>
<L>Feasted with blood his Scottish clan,</L>
<L>And hang'd all rebels, to a man;</L>
<L>Divided their estates and pelf;</L>
<L>And took a goodly share himself.</L>
<L>All this with spirit energetic,</L>
<L>He did by second-sight prophetic.</L>
<L>Thus stor'd with intellectual riches,</L>
<L>Skill'd was our 'Squire in making Speeches,</L>
<L>Where strength of brains united centers</L>
<L>With strength of lungs surpassing stentor's</L>
<L>But as some musquets so contrive it,</L>
<L>As oft to miss the mark they drive at,</L>
<L>And tho' well aim'd at duck or plover,</L>
<L>Bear wide and kick their owners over:</L>
<L>So far'd our 'Squire, whose reas'ning toil</L>
<L>Would often on himself recoil,</L>
<L>And so much injured more his side,</L>
<L>The stronger arg'ments he applied.</L>
<L>As old war-elephants dismay'd,</L>
<L>Trode down the troops they came to aid,</L>
<L>And hurt their own side more in battle</L>
<L>Than less and ordinary cattle.</L>
<L>Yet at town-meetings ev'ry chief</L>
<L>Pinn'd faith on great M'Fingal's sleeve,</L>
<L>And as he motion'd all by rote</L>
<L>Rais'd sympathetic hands to vote.</L>
<L>The town, our hero's scene of action,</L>
<L>Had long been torn by feuds of faction,</L>
<L>And as each party's strength prevails,</L>
<L>It turn'd up diff'rent, heads or tails;</L>
<L>With constant rattl'ing in a trice</L>
<L>Show'd various sides as oft as dice;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="014528_0006_0F92FD5764554CD0"/>
As that fam'd weaver, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer's Odissey</NOTE> wife t' Ulysses,</L>
<L>By night each day's-work pick'd in pieces,</L>
<L>And tho' she stoutly did bestir her,</L>
<L>Its finishing was ne'er the nearer:</L>
<L>So did this town with sted fast zeal</L>
<L>Weave cob-webs for the public weal,</L>
<L>Which when completed, or before,</L>
<L>A second vote in pieces tore.</L>
<L>They met, made speeches full long winded,</L>
<L>Resolv'd, protested, and rescinded;</L>
<L>Addresses sign'd, then chose Committees,</L>
<L>To stop all drinking of Bohea-teas;</L>
<L>With winds of doctrine veer'd about,</L>
<L>And turn'd all Whig-Committees out.</L>
<L>Meanwhile our hero, as their head,</L>
<L>In pomp the tory-faction led,</L>
<L>Still following, as the 'Squire should please,</L>
<L>Successive on, like files of geese.</L>
<L>And now the town was summon'd greeting,</L>
<L>To grand parading of town-meeting;</L>
<L>A show, that strangers might appall,</L>
<L>As Rome's grave senate did the gaul.</L>
<L>High o'er the rout, on pulpit-stairs,</L>
<L>Like den of thieves in house of pray'rs,</L>
<L>(That house, which loth a rule to break,</L>
<L>Serv'd heav'n but one day in the week,</L>
<L>Open the rest for all supplies</L>
<L>Of news and politics and lies)</L>
<L>Stood forth the constable, and bore</L>
<L>His staff, like Merc'ry's wand of yore,</L>
<L>Wav'd potent round, the peace to keep,</L>
<L>As that laid dead mens souls to sleep.</L>
<L>Above and near th' hermetic staff,</L>
<L>The moderator's upper half,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="014528_0007_0F92FD579F70EF58"/>
In grandeur o'er the cushion bow'd,</L>
<L>Like Sol half-seen behind a cloud.</L>
<L>Beneath stood voters of all colours,</L>
<L>Whigs, tories, orators and bawlers,</L>
<L>With ev'ry tongue in either faction,</L>
<L>Prepared, like minute-men, for action;</L>
<L>Where truth and falshood, wrong and right,</L>
<L>Draw all their legions out to sight;</L>
<L>With equal uproar, scarcely rave</L>
<L>Opposing winds in OE'lus' cave;</L>
<L>Such dialogues with earnest face</L>
<L>Held never Balaam with his ass.</L>
<L>With daring zeal and courage blest</L>
<L>Honorious first the croud address'd;</L>
<L>When now our 'Squire returning late,</L>
<L>Arrived to aid the grand debate,</L>
<L>With strange four faces-fat him down,</L>
<L>While thus the orator went on.</L>
<L>"—For ages blest, thus Britain rose</L>
<L>The terror of encircling foes;</L>
<L>Her heroes rul'd the bloody plain;</L>
<L>Her conq'ring standard aw'd the main:</L>
<L>The diff'rent palms her triumphs grace;</L>
<L>Of arms in war, of arts in peace:</L>
<L>Beneath her kind, maternal care,</L>
<L>Each rising province flourish'd fair;</L>
<L>Whose various wealth with lib'ral hand,</L>
<L>By far o'er-paid the parent-land,</L>
<L>But tho' so bright her sun might shine,</L>
<L>'T was quickly hasting to decline,</L>
<L>With feeble rays, too weak t' assuage,</L>
<L>The damps, that chill the eve of age.</L>
<L>For states, like men, are doom'd as well</L>
<L>Th' infirmities of age to feel;</L>
<L>And as their constitutions please 'em,</L>
<L>Find ev'ry deep distemper seize 'em.</L>

While others have grown dull and dozy,</L>
<L>Or fix'd in helpless idiocy.</L>
<L>Thus now while hoary years prevail,</L>
<L>Good Mother Britain seem'd to fail:</L>
<L>Her back bent, crippled with the weight</L>
<L>Of age and debts and cares of state:</L>
<L>For debts she owed, and those so large,</L>
<L>As twice her wealth could not discharge,</L>
<L>And now 'twas thought, so high they'd grown,</L>
<L>She'd break and come upon the town;</L>
<L>Her arms, of nations once the dread,</L>
<L>She scarce could lift above her head;</L>
<L>Her deafen'd ears ('twas all their hope)</L>
<L>The final trump perhaps might ope,</L>
<L>So long they'd been in stupid mood,</L>
<L>Shut to the hearing of all good;</L>
<L>Grim death had put her in his scroll,</L>
<L>Down on the execution-roll;</L>
<L>And Gallic crows, as she grew weaker,</L>
<L>Already whet their beaks to pick her,</L>
<L>And now her pow'rs decaying fast,</L>
<L>Her grand Climact'ric had she past,</L>
<L>And, just like all old women else,</L>
<L>Fell in the vapours much by spells:</L>
<L>Strange whimsies on her fancy struck,</L>
<L>And gave her brain a dismal shock;</L>
<L>Her mem'ry fails, her judgment ends;</L>
<L>She quite forgot her nearest friends,</L>
<L>Lost all her former sense and knowlege,</L>
<L>And fitted fast for Beth'lem college;</L>
<L>Of all the pow'rs she once retain'd,</L>
<L>Conceit and pride alone remain'd.</L>
<L>As Eve when falling was so modest</L>
<L>To fancy she should grow a goddess;</L>
<L>As madmen, straw who long have slept on,</L>
<L>Will stile them, Jupiter or Neptune:</L>
<L>So Britain 'midst her airs so flighty,</L>

<L>What tho' with supplicating pray'r</L>

<L>And could he talk, as kings can do,</L>
<L>Had made as gracious speeches too.</L>
<L>Thus spite of pray'rs her schemes pursuing,</L>
<L>She still went on to work our ruin;</L>
<L>Annull'd our charters of releases,</L>
<L>And tore our title-deeds in pieces;</L>
<L>Then sign'd her warrants of ejection,</L>
<L>And gallows rais'd to stretch our necks on:</L>

<L>Her bailiff, and her hangman, <HI>Gage,</HI></L>

<L>Inspir'd by freedom's heav'nly charms,</L>
<L>United nations wake to arms.</L>
<L>The star of conquest lights their way,</L>
<L>And guides their vengeance on their prey—</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="014528_0039_0F92FD72A149AEC8"/>
Yes, tho' tyrannic force oppose,</L>
<L>Still shall they triumph o'er their foes,</L>
<L>Till heav'n the happy land shall bless</L>
<L>With safety, liberty and peace.</L>
<L>And ye whose souls of dastard mould</L>
<L>Start at the brav'ry of the bold;</L>
<L>To love your country who pretend,</L>
<L>Yet want all spirit to defend;</L>
<L>Who feel your fancies so prolific,</L>
<L>Engend'ring vision'd whims terrific,</L>
<L>O'er-run with horrors of coercion,</L>
<L>Fire, blood and thunder in reversion,</L>
<L>King's standards, pill'ries, confiscations,</L>
<L>And Gage's scarecrow proclamations,</L>
<L>With all the trumpery of fear;</L>
<L>Hear bullets whizzing in your rear;</L>
<L>Who scarce could rouze, if caught in fray,</L>
<L>Presence of mind to run away;</L>
<L>See nought but halters rise to view</L>
<L>In all your dreams (and dreams are true)</L>
<L>And while these phantoms haunt your brains,</L>
<L>Bow down the willing neck to chains:</L>
<L>Heav'ns! are ye sons of sires so great,</L>
<L>Immortal in the fields of fate,</L>
<L>Who brav'd all deaths by land or sea,</L>
<L>Who bled, who conquer'd, to be free!</L>
<L>Hence, coward souls, the worst disgrace</L>
<L>Of our forefather's valiant race!</L>
<L>Hie homeward from the glorious field;</L>
<L>There turn the wheel, the distaff wield;</L>
<L>Act what ye are, nor dare to stain</L>
<L>The warrior's arms with touch profane:</L>
<L>There beg your more heroic wives</L>
<L>To guard your children and your lives;</L>
<L>Beneath their aprons find a screen,</L>
<L>Nor dare to mingle more with men."</L>
<L>As thus he said, the Tories' anger</L>
<L>Could now restrain itself no longer.</L>

Who tried before by many a freak, or</L>
<L>Insulting noise, to stop the speaker;</L>
<L>Swung th' unoil'd hinge of each pew-door;</L>
<L>Their feet kept shuffling on the floor;</L>
<L>Made their disapprobation known</L>
<L>By many a murmur, hum and groan;</L>
<L>That to his speech supplied the place</L>
<L>Of counterpart in thorough-base:</L>
<L>As bag-pipes, while the tune they breathe,</L>
<L>Still groan and grumble underneath;</L>
<L>Or as the fam'd Demosthenes</L>
<L>Harangued the rumbling of the seas,</L>
<L>Held forth with eloquence so grave</L>
<L>To audience loud of wind and wave;</L>
<L>And had a stiller congregation</L>
<L>Than Tories are to hear th' oration.</L>
<L>But now the storm grew high and louder</L>
<L>As nearer thundrings of a cloud are,</L>
<L>And ev'ry soul with heart and voice</L>
<L>Supplied his quota of the noise:</L>
<L>Each listning ear was set on torture</L>
<L>Each Tory bell'wing out, to order;</L>
<L>And some, with tongue not low or weak,</L>
<L>Were clam'ring fast, for leave to speak;</L>
<L>The moderator, with great vi'lence,</L>
<L>The cushion thump'd with "Silence, silence;"</L>
<L>The constable to ev'ry prater</L>
<L>Bawl'd out, "Pray hear the moderator;"</L>
<L>Some call'd the vote, and some in turn</L>
<L>Were screaming high, "Adjourn, adjourn:"</L>
<L>Not chaos heard such jars and clashes</L>
<L>When all the el'ments fought for places.</L>
<L>Each bludgeon soon for blows was tim'd;</L>
<L>Each fist stood ready cock'd and prim'd;</L>
<L>The storm each moment louder grew;</L>
<L>His sword the great M'Fingal drew;</L>
<L>Prepar'd in either chance to share,</L>
<L>To keep the peace, or aid the war.</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="014528_0041_0F92FD75CFB87D88"/>
Nor lack'd they each poetic being,</L>
<L>Whom bards alone are skill'd in seeing;</L>
<L>Plum'd victory stood perch'd on high,</L>
<L>Upon the pulpit-canopy,</L>
<L>To join, as is her custom tried,</L>
<L>Like Indians, on the strongest side;</L>
<L>The destinies with shears and distaff,</L>
<L>Drew near their threads of life to twist off;</L>
<L>Old Jove had got his scales and weights</L>
<L>To balance their impending fates;</L>
<L>The furies 'gan to feast on blows,</L>
<L>And broken heads or bloody nose:</L>
<L>When on a sudden from without</L>
<L>Arose a loud terrific shout;</L>
<L>And strait the people all at once heard</L>
<L>Of tongues an universal concert;</L>
<L>Like AEsop's times, as fable runs,</L>
<L>When ev'ry creature talk'd at once,</L>
<L>Or like the variegated gabble</L>
<L>That craz'd the carpenters of Bable.</L>
<L>Each party soon forgot the quarrel,</L>
<L>And let the other go on parole;</L>
<L>Eager to know what fearful matter</L>
<L>Had conjur'd up such gen'ral clatter;</L>
<L>And left the church in thin array,</L>
<L>As tho' it had been lecture-day.</L>
<L>Our 'Squire M'Fingal straitway beckon'd</L>
<L>The constable to stand his second,</L>
<L>And fallied forth with aspect fierce</L>
<L>The croud assembled to disperse.</L>
<L>The moderator out of view</L>
<L>Beneath a bench had lain perdue;</L>
<L>Peep'd up his head to view the fray,</L>
<L>Beheld the wranglers run away,</L>
<L>And left alone with solemn face,</L>
<L>Adjourn'd them without time or place.</L>
