<P>Now let the Impartial Reader judge, which have exceeded in hard Words? and whether they are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very partial to pass by all that hath been said against G. K. and condemn him for what he hath sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s right place, as is made appear in the Book called, <HI>The Plea of the Innocent.</HI> And yet when G. K. was the Complainer for many Months, for Justice to be done to Truth, they could plead for D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scount, and put Blasphemy against Christ Jesus, in the Ballance against Reflections upon themselves, and yet now will not disount for hard words. And a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so they have judged a whole Meeting without ever admo∣nishing of them. If this be not Partiality, Injustice and Un∣righteous Judgment, tell us what is. And clear your selves of these things, if you can.</P>
