<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, gentlemen, a pretty state for British gene∣rals and British troops—the terror of the world become mere scare-crows to themselves.—We came to <HI>America,</HI> flush'd with high expectations of conquest, and curbing these sons of riot.—We tour'd away in the senate as if our success was certain; as if we had only to curb a few licentious villains, or hang them as spectacles for their brethren —But how are we deceiv'd?—Instead of this agreeable employ, we are shamefully confin'd with∣in the bounds of <HI>three miles, wrangling</HI> and <HI>starving</HI> a∣mong ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curs'd alternative, either to be murder'd with∣out, or starv'd within.—These <HI>yankey dogs</HI> treat us like a parcel of poltroons; they divert themselves by firing at us, as at a flock of partridges.—A man can scarcely put his nose over the intrenchments without losing it;—ano∣ther loses his eyes, only looking thro' the ambuseirs.— They have a set of fellows call'd <HI>rifflers</HI>; they would shoot the very <HI>devil</HI> if he was to come within a league of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Bash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, it will not do to set groaning here; let us determine upon some plan quickly to be done, otherwise I shall bid you farewell, and you may
<PB N="4" REF="015213_0004_0F99909731D9A860"/>
follow after as well as you are able.—You find every night brings them nearer and nearer; they raise a hill and for∣tify it in 6 hours —I expect soon to see a fortification grow out of the <HI>channel,</HI> and our <HI>ships of war</HI> to be blown up by some damn'd machine.—Such devils are capable of any thing; the power of miracles is put into their hands, and they improve the patent to admiration.—You must do something to dispossess them of those fortifications, otherwise we shall not only be starv'd, but absolutely murder'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L—d Dap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Starv'd or murder'd are triffles, com∣par'd to being taken prisoners, to be drag'd before their <HI>congresses, committees, &amp;c.</HI>—A pack of mutton-headed fellows, with their rusty musquets, are more dread visi∣tors, than a tribe of furies, just arriv'd from h—l; there∣fore let us do something in earnest, or perhaps we shall be too late for relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>The eminence on <HI>Dorchester-hill,</HI> which they be∣gan last night, they must at all hazards be dispossess'd of; we must rally our weak numbers, and drive them if pos∣sible; but such is our situation, our men are become meer <HI>skeletons</HI>; their present diet renders them more ca∣pable of <HI>terrifying</HI> their enemies, than <HI>fighting</HI> of them▪ —They will think the <HI>ghosts</HI> of their forefathers are coming to battle against them.—Poor devils! I pity their miserable state, but so the fates have order'd it, we can only laugh or pity each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L—d Dap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curss'd cruel fate! that we should thus be pen'd up.—<HI>Churchill</HI>'s description of <HI>Scotland</HI> is but a shadow to it;—if that great genius was now alive, we should soon have a new edition with amendments.—He represents their <HI>flies and spiders,</HI> &amp;c. as <HI>starving,</HI> but here they are absolutely starv'd—poor innocent insects, I forgive ye your former tormenting of my legs; ye suck'd 'till you could find no nourishment, and then fell at my feet and died.—Thousands have lain gasping within the small circle of my chair; their case was truly deplorable—I felt their state by experience.—My case is somewhat parallel to the <HI>prodigal son.</HI>—I may well adopt his words,
<Q>how
<PB N="5" REF="015213_0005_0F999097D9D76AE0"/>
many hired servants of my father's, have bread enough and to spare, while I perish with hunger.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shal.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall all be oblig'd to follow his example; I never thought to make an improvement of a parable, but our case is now so truly deplorable that necessity prompts me to it.—<HI>Hard crusts</HI> and <HI>rusty bones</HI> have never till <HI>now</HI> become my diet; they do not suit my <HI>digestion.</HI>— My <HI>teeth</HI> are worn to stumps, and my <HI>lips</HI> are swell'd like a blubber-mouth negro's, by thumping <HI>hard bones</HI> against them; my <HI>jaw bone</HI> has been set a dozen times, dislocated by chewing <HI>hard pork,</HI> as tough as an old swine's ass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well gentlemen, we are all acquainted with each other's circumstances, but however, we cannot mend them by recounting them —Let us rally our men and drive those <HI>rebels</HI> from their fortifications, or else we may soon expect to be introduc'd to their honor's <HI>Adams</HI> and <HI>Hancock,</HI> with sundry other gentlemen of distinction▪ — My <HI>L—d Dapper</HI> must have the command, and I doubt not we shall be able to dispossess them.—Let us keep up our spirits, for we have nothing else to feed on, tho' it is a <HI>poor dish</HI> for a greedy appetite.</P>

<P>Some pretence must be made, as our ho∣nor is at stake.

<P>Nothing can be more wretched than our state,— <HI>vagabonds</HI> and <HI>outcasts</HI> in the world!—here we are,— <HI>friends we have none,</HI>—we fled here for protection, but how are we disappointed!—Those on whom we depended, are as miserable as ourselves!—we have been cajol'd in∣to all this by that curss'd <HI>H—n,</HI>—he pleas'd us with <HI>pensions, posts of honor, and profit,</HI> but the villain has fled, and left us to shirk for ourselves.—My dwellings I have forsaken, my family are left to feed on the charity of friends, <HI>if they can find any</HI>; while I, poor wretch, have thrown myself upon the mercy of those who are <HI>un∣able</HI> to help me.—My <HI>money</HI> I have let out on <HI>govern∣ment security</HI>—and poor security too, I am afraid;—from
<PB N="6" REF="015213_0006_0F999098B4841B68"/>
<HI>affluence and splendor,</HI> I am reduc'd to <HI>wretchedness and misery,</HI> and skulk about the streets like a dog that has lost one ear.—Oh curss'd ambition! much better had it been if I had stay'd among my countrymen, and partook quietly of the produce of my farm.—Why need I have medled in politicks, or burnt my fingers dabbling in this sea of fire —My tenants and my oxen would have been much more agreeable companions than these herd of <HI>stalking poltroons,</HI> swaggering with their swords at their a— and afraid to draw them from the scabbard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simp.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have reason to blame ourselves—we have brought affairs to the present state—we were fond of the titles of Col. Esq. &amp;c.—a gewgow of a <HI>commission</HI> was sufficient to render us <HI>enemies</HI> to our country—We contriv'd a <HI>thousand tricks</HI> to make ourselves obnoxious to our countrymen, that we might be noticed as <HI>friends to government</HI>;—we thought this would recommend us to some <HI>lucrative post</HI>:—We embrac'd the shadow of gran∣deur, but the substance has fled — A bow from a <HI>general</HI> or a <HI>fifer</HI> is all the satisfaction we have for our loyalty.— I am become almost asham'd of my company; a pack of <HI>strutting pedanticks,</HI> looking like elopers from the grave▪ "grinning horribly their ghastly smiles;" gallanting their <HI>drosly nymphs,</HI> hag'd with constant use.—Sometimes I am ready to heave myself upon the mercy of my injur'd country, but the awful ideas of <HI>committees, courts of en∣quiry,</HI> &amp;c. terrify me from this expedient:—Besides, shall we stoop to submission to these <HI>miscreants</HI>;—we, <HI>Col's. Esq'rs. Iudges,</HI> &amp;c. bow to the lordly sway of these <HI>vile villains?</HI>—I will rather perish than do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our pride is our only cordial—we have nothing else to feed on;—d-m'd poor nourishment!—we have been long fed on the sumptuous dish of <HI>expectation of re∣lief,</HI> but alass! we had so keen an appetite for that, we quickly devour'd it;—the general has no further supply left him, and we are now left to famish till a fresh supply comes.— We have fled here as <HI>friends to government,</HI> but how are we treated?—<HI>We are despised, our wives ra∣vag'd, and our daughters debauch'd;—honor</HI> or <HI>profit we
<PB N="7" REF="015213_0007_0F999099593C1158"/>
have none—abuse</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> we have our ample shares of. —Much happier had we been, if instead of <HI>bowing</HI> and <HI>cringing</HI> to the great, we had minded the concerns of our farms; and instead of calculating the <HI>revenue</HI> of the nation, we had considered the income of our own stocks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alass! we have all been deceived;—we have been pleased with the expectation of <HI>large reinforcements</HI>; —that conquest was certain;—and that the <HI>rebels</HI> would be speedily crushed —Flush'd with these sanguine hopes, we have buoyed ourselves amidst these seas of tumult and outrage, but now we find ourselves wofully <HI>deceived,</HI> with∣out any remedy.—<HI>Victory</HI> seems to declare in favour of the country; she has fled from these <HI>brave sons of mars,</HI> and takes refuge within the cells and cottages of <HI>America.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, gentlemen, you may all <HI>whine</HI> and <HI>cry,</HI> for my part I am determined to keep up my spirits, and hope for better times—why should we be so discomforted, because we have met with a little rugged treatment?— we must expect to encounter with many such trifles, but shall they discourage us? can we expect to gain honor in a silver slipper? no, we must engage with all H—l ra∣ther than give up our point.—Its true, friend <HI>Paunch</HI> cannot meet with his <HI>Dainty Soups,</HI> nor feast on his fa∣vourite <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> but shall this render him peevish and fretful? I hope not—we are now to try our <HI>Loyalty,</HI> by the grand touchstone of <HI>Affliction</HI>; let us act like men, and I doubt not we shall be well rewarded.—His MAJESTY will regard us as the <HI>faithful</HI> of the land, and will recom∣mence our fidelity with ample tokens of his affection.— Your poor <HI>dejected Countenances</HI> are a disgrace to the cause we are engag'd in; reconcile yourselves to your present state, and I doubt not a happy deliverance will speedily arrive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meagre.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Deliverance</HI> is a poor <HI>worn out, unmeaning</HI> word—I am tir'd with the sound—a word with so little meaning you cannot produce in a groce of dictionaries— <HI>Loyalty and Deliverance</HI> are pleasing words when us'd with <HI>propriety,</HI> but they are now maim'd with often handling.</P>

<P><HI>L—d Dapper</HI> has address'd me in very honora∣ble terms; he proposes to carry me to England, after the present campaign, but my father (an old prig) is greatly against it, and seems tired with the company of these <HI>red coats,</HI> (as he calls them)—but this person I am deter∣mined to have at all hazards.—Why should I deny my∣self the pleasures and honors of this life, to please an <HI>old fool</HI> that is just leaving of them.—The title of <HI>lady</HI> is very agreeable; it is what many would jump at;—such matches do not offer every day, and I shall improve the time as dextrous as I can.</P>

<P>Make hay while the sun shines, is a very good maxim.—Indeed, madam, I approve your determination; I should think you quite mad to determine otherways— who would not have a young spark if they could meet with one?—For my own part I would not lodge ano∣ther night without one, if I could meet with a good offer.</P>

over each other.—I esteem my life beyond my honor, and am not for throwing it away for the diversion of a parcel of <HI>yankees</HI>—If we cannot hold the garrison by <HI>keeping in,</HI> for God's sake, let's beat a <HI>retreat</HI>; but the LORD knows where; however, I had rather heave myself upon the mercy of the sea, than be taken their prisoner: —Who but a <HI>mad man</HI> would trust himself out of these entrenchments? it is certain death.—I am for fighting, where there is <HI>some prospect</HI> of coming off clear; but here venture yourself out, and I would not insure you for 100 <HI>per cent.</HI>—d—n the devils, they excel their very fa∣ther <HI>Belzebub</HI> for fighting.—I had rather engage with a squadron just arrived from the <HI>lower-regions,</HI> than with those curst fellows on <HI>yonder hill.</HI></P>

<P>It signifies nothing to <HI>fret,</HI> and find fault among ourselves, but let us be for securing a <HI>retreat</HI> as fast as possible—let us be packing up our <HI>alls,</HI> and making our best way off.—I have ruin'd my fortune, tagging after these poltroons—I will now trouble them with my com∣pany—if they cannot <HI>protect</HI> me, they shall maintain me; while they have any thing to eat themselves, I am deter∣mined to partake.—<HI>Poor encouragement</HI> for friends to go∣vernment; if they don't find better reception than we have met with, they will have but few volunteers.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, what think <HI>now</HI> of your agree∣able situation; your <HI>filthy farm,</HI> and <HI>coarse roast beef,</HI> &amp;c. nasty stuff!—what is the matter with your refined com∣pany that they fly away so abruptly, methinks they might have been <HI>polite enough</HI> to have given us some little notice of their retreat; not run away like a parcel of <HI>mice,</HI> when the <HI>cat comes among them.</HI>—I have for a long while been fearful of this, but found my mistake too late—I have outstay'd my day of grace, and find I must follow these ranters a wild goose chase over land and sea—I am tir'd of the chace! my family is ruin'd, and my daughter I am afraid, is debauch'd by a <HI>painted monkey,</HI> who I saw with her at the gate—the villain drew his sword upon me, but like a true <HI>British general,</HI> I thought fit to <HI>run away.</HI></P>

<P>I wonder, my dear, you should complain at go∣ing abroad—I am fond of seeing the world—what signi∣fies always to be pen't up within the smoke of our own chimnies?—why should we not travel like other gentle∣folks, to learn the <HI>manners</HI> and <HI>customs</HI> of other nations? must we always remain as ignorant as our <HI>brown bread</HI> neighbours and know nothing more of the world than what is transacted within our own parish?—for my part I am determined to extend my knowledge, and follow the fleet from one end of the world to the other, rather than remain as ignorant as our <HI>parson's wife.</HI>—The ru∣mour is, that we are going to <HI>Halifax</HI>; a rich, flourish∣ing

<P>Ha, ha, ha,—yankee doodle forever—I wish <HI>Lord North</HI> was here, to see his brave troops in their pre∣sent plight, running away with their <HI>breeches down</HI>—who can help laughing at what a <HI>tom fool</HI>'s errand we have been sent upon—we were sent here to ransack the coun∣try, and hang up a parcel of leading fellows for the crows to pick, and awe all others into <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>submissi∣on</HI>—instead
<PB N="18" REF="015213_0018_0F9990AA9E7800C8"/>
of this, in our first attempt we were drove thro' the country, like a <HI>pack</HI> of <HI>jack asses,</HI> nor stop'd run∣ning 'till we had got within <HI>Boston,</HI> where we had been for∣tify'd for six months—here we were confin'd, reduc'd to skeletons, our bones standing sentry thro' our skins—we ventur'd out once more to dispossess them of <HI>Bunker-hill,</HI> we gain'd the ground, but if we are to purchase the whole land of America at so dear a rate, the <HI>Lord have mercy upon us.</HI>—We have receiv'd reinforcements, but they only serv'd to fill up the vacancies made at <HI>Bunker-hill</HI> frolic—large force of <HI>artillery, light horse,</HI> and the devil knows what, have come to our assistance, but what has been our luck? <HI>loss of men,</HI> of <HI>honor,</HI> of <HI>flesh,</HI> and to crown the whole, are now <HI>running away,</HI> as fast as we can scamper.</P>

<P>A pretty story this in the British annals—an ever∣lasting disgrace will attend the transactions in America.— Our <HI>best generals,</HI> with a force of artillery, sufficient one would think, to storm the regions of <HI>Belzebub</HI>—the most <HI>experienc'd troops</HI> his Majesty has; a capital navy; yet, with all this force, <HI>our generals</HI> dare not peep over the entrenchments—are confin'd within three miles of garrison, <HI>writing</HI> and <HI>acting comedies</HI>—dismantling <HI>meet∣ing houses</HI> to exercise their horses, to prevent their having the <HI>scurvy</HI>—our troops <HI>hag'd</HI> and <HI>famish'd,</HI> for want of re∣freshments—our navy lying at anchor, while the <HI>priva∣teers</HI> are depriving us of our supplies.—"MISTERIOUS! UNEXAMPLED! INCOMPREHENSIBLE!"—Disgrace too great for the spirit of Britons!—Not an action have we done, that has been any way to our <HI>honor</HI> or <HI>profit</HI>—it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we have set a few towns on fire, but like champi∣ons, took care to go where there was not even a <HI>pistol</HI> for defence.</P>

<P>Nothing can be more diverting, than to see the town in its present situation—all is <HI>uproar</HI> and <HI>confusion—carts, trucks, wheel barrows, hand barrows, coaches, chaise,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> driving as if the very devil was after them.

are just upon them.—Orders are given for <HI>blocking</HI> up the streets, that the <HI>rebels</HI> may break their shins, if they pur∣sue us—we have also a parcel of <HI>stuff'd images,</HI> looking like devils behind the <HI>pope,</HI> to be fix'd up as <HI>senteries</HI>; a fit emblem of ourselves—<HI>Burgoyne</HI> could not have con∣triv'd a <HI>prettier satyr</HI>—our <HI>ambuseirs</HI> are fill'd with <HI>wood∣en guns</HI>; d—m such <HI>wooden-headed</HI> commanders—to crown the whole, they should have had an effigy with a <HI>barber's block-head,</HI> as <HI>engineer.</HI>—Oh Briton! your dis∣grace makes my very blood dance the hornpipe.—The poor <HI>yankee refugees,</HI> run backwards and forwards, like a parcel of cats let out of a bag—I would give half mm pay, that some droll blade was here to describe the ludri∣cous scenery.</P>
