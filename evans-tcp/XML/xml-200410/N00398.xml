<P>The House of Commons Ordered a Bill to be drawn up for the Restoration of Charters to all Corporations. Some Enemies of <HI>New-England</HI> did bestir themselves on that Occasion. But it has pleased God to succeed Endeavours and Sollicitations here so far, as that <HI>N.E.</HI> is particularly mentioned in the Bill.</P>
<P>It has been read twice, and after that referred unto a Committee for Emendations. What con∣cerns <HI>N. England</HI> passed without any great op∣position. The Bill has been in part read the third Time, and the Charters of <HI>N.-Eng.</HI> then also pas∣sed without Objection. Only some Additional Clauses respecting Corporations here, caused De∣bates; so that the Bill is not as yet Enacted.</P>
<P>In the latter end of <HI>June,</HI> a Vessel from <HI>Mount Hope</HI> arrived here, which brought your Declarati∣on of <HI>April</HI> 18. with an account of the Revoluti∣on in <HI>New-England.</HI> The week after I went to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and had the favour to wait on His Majesty, who told me, <HI>That He did accept of, and was well pleased with what was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in</HI> New-England, <HI>and that he would order the Secretary of State to signi∣fie <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ancient Rights and Priviledges restored to them.</HI></P>
<P>The King has sent a Gracious Letter (which was delivered to me, and if I return not my self, I shall take care that it be sent to you) bearing Date <HI>August</HI> 12. <HI>Wherein He signifies His Royal Ap∣probation</HI> of what has been done at <HI>Boston,</HI> and assures you that the Government there shall be settled, so as shall be for the Security and Satisfaction of His Subjects in that Colony, and in the mean time bids you go on to Administer the Laws, and manage the Government, according as in your Address you have Petitioned.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Mordent</HI> (now Earl of <HI>Monmouth</HI>) bade me assure you that He would be your Friend, and he bade me tell you from him, <HI>That your Charters should be restored to you by Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>I have been with most of the Kings most Hon∣ourable Privy Council, who have promised to be∣friend <HI>New-England</HI> as there shall be occasion for it. The like I may say, of all the Leading men in the Parliament.</P>
<P>I have been in the <HI>Downs</HI> a fortnight, and A∣board Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, several Nights, but the Wind has been against us. And we now hear that the <HI>New-found-Land</HI> Convoyes (on whose Assistance we had a Dependance) are gone.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Passage extracted from the publick News-Letter, Dated</HI> July 6. 1689.</HEAD>
<P>The people of <HI>New-England</HI> having made a thorow Revolution, and secured the publick Criminals. On <HI>Thursday</HI> last, the Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> President of the <HI>Col∣ledge,</HI> and Minister of <HI>Boston,</HI> waited on the King; and in a most Excellent Speech laid be∣fore His Majesty, the State of that People; saying, <HI>That they were sober, and Industrious, and fit for Martial Service; and all with their Lives and Interests were at His Majesties Com∣mand, to tender the same unto His Majesty: That they desired nothing but His Majesties Ac∣ceptance of what they had done, and His Prote∣ction; and that if His Majesty pleased to encou∣rage and Commission them, He might easily be Emperour of</HI> America. His Majesty assured him, that He was pleased with what was done for Him, and for themselves in the Revoluti∣on, and that their Priviledges and Religion should be secured unto them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Extracted from a Letter of Mr.</HI> Mather, to his <HI>Son, Dated</HI> Sept. 2. 1689.</HEAD>
<P>On <HI>July</HI> 4. The King said unto me, <HI>That He did kindly Accept of what was done in</HI> Bo∣ston. <HI>And that His Subjects in</HI> New-England <HI>should have their Ancient Rights and Priviledges Restored and Confirmed unto them.</HI> Yea, He told me, <HI>That if it were in his power to cause it to be done it should be done,</HI> and bade me rest assured of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charter-Bill</HI> is not finished, because some Additional Clauses respecting Corpora∣tions here in <HI>England</HI> caused a Debate; and the Parliament is for some weeks Adjourned.</P>
<P>Besides the Letter from the Kings Majesty, whereof we have notice as above; there is now arrived, an Order from His Majesty to the Government, bearing Date, <HI>July</HI> 30. 1689.</P>
<P>Requiring, <HI>That Sir</HI> Edmund Andross, Edward Randolph, <HI>and others, that have been Seized by the people of</HI> Boston, <HI>and shall be at the Receipt of these Commands, Detained there, under Confinement, be sent on Board the first Ship, bound to</HI> England, <HI>to answer what may be objected against them.</HI></P>
