The Author instead of keeping to his Text, or to the <HI>Doctrine of the Apostles and Pro∣phets,</HI> has obtruded upon us notions of <HI>his own,</HI> which he calls <HI>Good Rules in Divinity</HI>: but eve∣ry one of them, if not taken with grains of <HI>Salt,</HI> are <HI>unsavoury Divinity.</HI> This Writer has not long since been famous for corrupting ma∣ny in the <HI>Fundamentals of Religion,</HI> in which he has seen and renounced his errors, and is on that account worthy of commendation▪ Nevertheless, it seems by the Publication of his present pretended Sentiments, he aims a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gaining a Reputation by Endeavours to seduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

I think there is no great fear that such weak reasonings as he has offered, will gain many Prose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es among those who are so well inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ightned in the <HI>Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles,</HI> as the People in <HI>New England</HI> (through Grace) generally are.

We shall there∣fore make some few <HI>Remarks</HI> upon them.</P>

Doubtless his meaning is, that in things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot forbidden by the Divine Law, the Commandments of Bishops must be obeyed.

<P N="3"><HI>Sect.</HI> 3. The Second <HI>Canon</HI> which Mr. <HI>K.</HI> would impose upon us, says that, <HI>Whatever Church holds the Fundamentals of the Christian Religion, and has the Word of God duly Preached, and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Sup∣per duly administred, such a Church is a true Church of Christ and to separate from such a Church in Ex∣ternal Communion, &amp; in External Acts of Worship, is a Sin, the which Sin is the Sin of Schism.</HI> It is e∣vident by these words that he has not attained unto the true notion of <HI>Schism.</HI> According to him, <HI>Schism</HI> consists in a <HI>Separation from a true Church in external acts of Worship</HI>; but ac∣cording to Scripture, men may be guilty of <HI>Schism,</HI> and yet hold <HI>External Communion</HI> with that Church where they have made a <HI>Schism.

for which the Earth made a <HI>Schism</HI> to swallow up him and his Company, yet he did not se∣parate from the Church in <HI>external acts of Worship.</HI> The <HI>Schismaticks</HI> in the Church at <HI>Corinth</HI> did not withdraw from the Communion of the Church. They did not make <HI>separate Meetings,</HI> but all <HI>came together,</HI> meeting at the same place, and partaking of the Lords Supper, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.17▪ 20. There were those among them that caused <HI>Contentions</HI> and <HI>Divisions,</HI> and they were the <HI>Schismaticks.</HI> When after the Apostles death, that Church was influenced by two or three chief men among them, so as that the major part of the brethren deposed their Elders with∣out any just cause, they were again guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of <HI>Schism,</HI> which occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioned <HI>Clemens Romanus</HI> to Write an Admirable Epistle to them, yet they did not then neither (so far as do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appear) separate from <HI>Communion in external acts of Wor∣ship▪</HI> If Mr. <HI>K.</HI> will consult Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philip Henry,</HI> they will let him understand that his notion of Schism is not Scriptural nor <HI>good Divinity.</HI> Nor is it a true Assertion, that <HI>to separate from a true Church in some external acts of Worship is always a Sin, or that they who do so are guilty of Schism.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. There may be just and allowable causes of such a <HI>Separation.</HI> The late Bishop of <HI>Worcester</HI> has mentioned several <HI>Cases</HI> wherein the Scripture allows of <HI>Separation.</HI> One of which he says, is, <HI>if false Doctrine is imposed in∣stead

Are there not some true Churches in the world, in which <HI>Lutheranism</HI> is imposed? Another of his cases, is, <HI>If men make things indiffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t necssary to Salvation.</HI> A Learned man infers upon it, why is not the imposing of things in∣different, so as to make the observation of them necessary unto <HI>Temporal Salvation,</HI> a just cause of <HI>Separation?</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Original of Churches, first part <HI>p.</HI> 334 <HI>ibid p.</HI> 181. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> has mentioned four other just causes of with-drawing Communion from some Churches. That incompara∣ble Author dos also Assert and has proved, that <HI>where the Fundamentals of Church order, practice and discipline are destroyed, it is not Lawful for any man to joyn in Church Communion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is possible that a true Church may <HI>walk-disorderly,</HI> and not hearken to the Admonitions of those that would reclaim them from the Er∣ror of their way: They may tolerate Scanda∣lous evils, and very Scandalous persons in their Communion. Dos not the Church do so throughout most if not all the Parishes in <HI>Eng∣land?</HI> And yet Mr. <HI>K</HI> will now (though a while ago he would not) own them to be <HI>true Churches.</HI> In this case with drawing is no Sin, but a duty rather. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.6. <HI>We Com∣mand you brethren in the Name of our Lord Jesus
<PB N="9" REF="001078_0010_0FAFDF3F809229F8"/>
Christ, that you withdraw your selves from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very brother that walks disorderly.</HI> The Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in those words seems to have respect to the Jews <HI>Nidui,</HI> which signifies <HI>Separation,</HI> and was the lowest of Ecclesiastical censures among them. If then <HI>every Brother</HI> in a Church shall walk dis∣orderly and scandalously, (which is not im∣possible) neighbour Churches may and ought to with-draw from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines do many of them own the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be a <HI>true Church,</HI> because they pretend to a belief of that which is commonly called the <HI>Apostles Creed,</HI> and they have the Sacrament of <HI>Baptism</HI> admi∣nistred among them in the Name of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> Yet the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is not guilty of <HI>Schism</HI> in separating from the Church of <HI>Rome!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is possible that a true Church may im∣pose on its Members unlawful terms of Com∣munion, and then if a <HI>Schism happen</HI> the guilt will lie not on them that dare not Sin, but on them that make such <HI>Terms of Com∣munion</HI> as God in his Word does not ap∣prove of. And this I take to be the case be∣tween the <HI>Church of England</HI> and the <HI>Dissenters.</HI> The Law requires all Ministers to <HI>declare their assent and consent to all and every thing contained &amp; prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer.</HI> This they dare not for their lives do, because they should then dissemble with God &amp; men. One of the first things in the <HI>Liturgy</HI> is Mathamatically false; for it giveth a <HI>Rule for the finding of Ea∣ster

The Common Prayer Book will not al∣low the Minister to <HI>Baptize</HI> without the <HI>Sign of the Cross,</HI> nor unless <HI>God fathers</HI> and <HI>God mo∣thers</HI> be procured.
