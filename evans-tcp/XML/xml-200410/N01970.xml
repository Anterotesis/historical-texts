<HEAD>HOOP-PETTICOATS Arraigned and Condemned, BY THE Light of Nature, AND Law of God.</HEAD>
<P>IT is just Matter of Lamentation, that Sin and Iniquity so much abounds a∣mongst us, in this Land, notwithstand∣ing our great Profession and Privileges, and the heavy Judgments of God upon us for our Sins: And it is especially sad, that the Sin of Pride does so much abound un∣der so many humbling Judgments. And how many ways do we declare our Pride and manifest the same? But what I would par∣ticularly insist upon is in our Apparel, in following vain and sinful Fashions, and par∣ticularly.
<PB N="2" REF="002341_0002_0FDBC9D4EA545590"/>
that vain, sinful, immodest one of <HI>Hoop-Petticoats,</HI> Now, that I may make good this Charge against them, I shall shew that they are condemned by the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> and <HI>Law of God:</HI> And this will be evi∣dent, if we consider, that they answer not, but contradict the Ends of Apparel. We will consider therefore what the Ends of Appa∣rel are.</P>
<P N="1">1. One End of Apparel is to <HI>hide Nakedness.</HI> Our first Parents indeed in the State of In∣nocency, were naked and were not ashamed but Sin brought Shame, and therefore after the Fall, they sewed Fig-Leaves together to cover their Nakedness: But God provided better Covering for them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Coats of Skins for this end. Now, whatever Fashions of Apparel don't answer, or are contrary to this End, are sinful, Now, that Hoops in Petticoats don't answer this End, but rather contradict it, is evident, in that instead of co∣vering our Nakedness they expose it; and upon some emergent Accidents, expose those Parts that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> seem'd to take es∣pecial Care to cover, in the Aprons they provided; and those Parts which the Apostle stiles <HI>less honourable,</HI> yea, <HI>uncomely Part</HI> which therefore have the more need of come∣ly Covering. See 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 23, 24. So that they voluntarily do that which was spo∣ken of by way of Threatning, and Judgment
<PB N="3" REF="002341_0003_0FDBC9D5F6FAC888"/>
to a proud People, Isai. 47, 2, 3. They <HI>make bare the Leg, and uncover the Thigh, so that their Nakedness is uncovered, yea, their shame is seen.</HI> So that we see, they answer not, but cross this End of Apparel, and make those Parts liable to be exposed, which God and Nature require to be covered.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another End of Apparel is to <HI>defend the Body from the Injuries it is liable to.</HI> Now, do these do it? or do they not rather expose it to these Injuries, as particularly the Injuries of the Weather? I am apt to think, that our Hoop Gallants find not suffi∣cient Warmth under the Skreen of their foolish Proverb (<HI>Pride feels no Cold</HI>) in some Seasons: But it may be some had rather part with their Health than their Hoops. And that they are troublesome and uneasy to the Body is evident. With what Difficulty do those that wear them of the large Size walk, especially in narrow Passages? How are they forced to twist and turn their Bodies? And can scarce enter in at the Doors of their Houses, or of the House of God: So that there Seems a Necessity either of making our Doors bigger, or their Hoops less. Methinks they would do well to consider, that <HI>strait is the gate, &amp; narrow the way that leads to Life;</HI> and whether their extensive Hoops may not be some hinderance unto them in walking in this narrow way, and entering in at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="002341_0004_0FDBC9D7D245CF88"/>
Gate, especially since it is necessary in or∣der thereto, that we part with our right Hand or Eye, when they offend us; Surely they ought to fear whether they shall have Entrance, who will not part with that which they have not more need of than they have of a Cough. And as they do not answer this end of Apparel to defend the Body, neither.</P>
<P N="3">3. Do they answer the other End of Ap∣parel, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>adorning the Body;</HI> altho' in this most of our Hoop Gallants take Sanctu∣ary: But how can that be an Ornament, which is contrary to the other Ends of Apparel, es∣pecially that of covering our nakedness? Can that be an Ornament which exposes those Parts which God and Nature require to be covered, and which the most barbarous Na∣tions by the Light of Nature are taught to conceal? Is that an Ornament which is contra∣ry to Modesty, Humility, Gravity, &amp; Sobriety, which are required in Women profeiling Godliness? But alas! How has Pride and Impudence usurped the Place of Humility and Modesty, since Women are <HI>almost naked,</HI> and are <HI>not at all ashamed;</HI> for instead of being <HI>a∣shamed of their Pride,</HI> they are <HI>proud of their Shame.</HI> Thus we see, that <HI>Hoop-Petticoats</HI> answer not, but contradict all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Apparel, therefore are condemned by the Light of Nature and Law of God. But I would show more particularly the Sin of
<PB N="5" REF="002341_0005_0FDBC9DA73593F98"/>
them from the Scripture, in Isai. 3. 16. There the Lord threatens his People, that he would bring heavy Judgments upon them for the Sin of Pride, and this as manifest in Appa∣rel: <HI>Moreover the Lord saith, because the Daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth Necks, and wanton Eyes, walk∣ing and mincing as they go, and making a tink∣ling with their Feet.</HI> A <HI>tinkling with their Feet:</HI> The Word from whence this has its Original signifies a <HI>Fetter,</HI> as most render it: They therefore render it, <HI>going as if they were fetter'd;</HI> and so understand it of such a nice kind of affected Pace as was in the for∣mer Term intimated, and there further de∣scribed, by a Resemblance taken from Cap∣tives or Prisoners that have <HI>Irons</HI> on their Legs, and so cannot go freely and readily, but in a slow and stalking Manner, as their Irons give them leave: Or as others, from those <HI>Cords</HI> or <HI>Fetters</HI> that Horse Breakers are wont to hamper young Colts withal, to bring them to a Pace. How applicable is this to our Hoop Ladies? But it may be some may say, this is too critical, and not solid Scripture Reasoning. Let such consi∣der that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="002341_0006_0FDBC9DBF6036480"/>
They should express by their outward Garb the inward Gravity of their Minds. Now I appeal to you; Do they do it that wear those extensive Hoops? Does this manifest their Shamefacedness and Modesty? More∣over the Apostle in Phil. 4. 8. says, <HI>What∣soever things are honest, pure, lovely, and of good report; if there be any Vertue, or any Praise, think on these Things.</HI> Now, does this answer these Characters? I will not say there is none honest that wear them but I may venture to say, without any Breach of Charity, that this is no Sign of their Honesty or Purity, and I think there is lit∣tle Loveliness in them; and I am sure they are not of good Report among the most judi∣cious Persons: Therefore what Vertue or Praise I beseech you is there in them: Are these then as becometh Women professing Godliness.</P>
<P>Consider further, whether this be suita∣ble to the Day. Is it not a Day of trouble, of Perplexity, and of treading down by the Lord of Hosts, in this Valley of Vision? Yea, a Day of Darkness and Gloominess, a Day of Clouds and thick Darkness, as the Morning spread upon the Mountains, in which the Inhabitants of the Land should tremble, by reason of the heavy Judgments of God upon us; a Day in which God is calling upon us, as in Joel 2. 12. and as in
<PB N="7" REF="002341_0007_0FDBC9DDF905E298"/>
Isai. 22. 12. 13. <HI>And in that Day did the Lord of Hosts call to weeping, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldness, and to sack cloth; but behold joy and gladness,</HI> &amp;c. It is not so with us at this Day; therefore we should consider what follows in the next Verse, which is enough to make any but such as are hardened as we are, to tremble: <HI>It was revealed in my Ears by the Lord of Hosts, surely this Iniquity shall not be purged away till ye die, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Is not Pride of Apparel an Evidence of a proud Heart, and that our uncircumcised Hearts are not yet humbled? May we not there∣fore fear that the Lord will punish us yet seven Times for our Sins?</P>
<P>Well then, since this is so great an Evil, we ought, as to avoid it our selves, so to do all we can to suppress it in others; espe∣cially Persons vested with Authority, should exert themselves therefor, whether it be Civil, Sacred, or Domestick.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> should. And if the wearing of Hoop-Petticoats were the Punishment of such as have proved them∣selves to be Whores, it might probably sup∣press two great Sins at once: And what more significant Mark or Badge can be gi∣ven?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ministers</HI> should exert themselves for this end, as they would not be Partakers of the Sins of others, that so they may be
<PB N="8" REF="002341_0008_0FDBC9E3351B69C8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say with <HI>Job,</HI> chap. 13. v. 34. <HI>Did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great Multitude? or did the Contempt of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> terrify me, that I kept silence?</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Husbands (unto whom the Wise should be in subjection)</HI> should suppress it in the Wife.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Parents (whom Children should obey</HI>) in∣stead of encouraging their Children as soon as they can go alone to go with a Hoop, (as many shamefully do) should exert their Parental Authority to prevent it.</P>
<P>I conclude all with what we have in Isai. 32. 9, 11. <HI>Rose up ye Women that are at case, bear my voice ye careless Daughters, give car unto my speech. Tremble ye Women that are at Fase, be troubled ye careless ones; strip ye and make ye bare, and gird sackcloth on your Loins.</HI></P>
