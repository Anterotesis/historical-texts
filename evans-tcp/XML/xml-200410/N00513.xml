<HEAD>Heresie and Hatred justly returned on the GUILTY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwithstanding the many tendious and vexatious Disputes and Controversies that have been among us of late concern∣ing Doctrines and Principles of Religion, one Party affirm∣ing, and the other denying, yet at other times in publick. <HI>Thomas L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yd</HI> and Party, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavoured to cast a Mist before the People to make them believe, That there is no difference in Doctrine betwixt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Geoge Keith.</HI> But on the 11th of the 10th Month, 1692. being the first Day of the Week, in the Publick Meeting at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before several Hundred People, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Delavall</HI> silenced that pretence, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>being guilty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Works of the Flesh, in two particulars,</HI> <ABBR>viz</ABBR>. <HI>Heresie and Hatred,</HI> using this as an Argument why I should not be heard, but my Ministry stopt and denyed: The Heresie whereof he accused was, <HI>That I have been heard to affirm, That the Light within is not sufficient to Salvation without something else.</HI> This he undertook to prove to be a <HI>Heresie,</HI> but not from any one place of Scripture, but from Friends books and particularly from a passage in <HI>W. Penn's</HI> part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Book called, <HI>The Christian Quaker,</HI> where he saith, <HI>The Talent is in it self suffici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t.</HI></P>
<P>Next, he undertook to prove me guilty of <HI>Hatred,</HI> because, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>I had reviled Friend, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accused them in divers things.</HI> But did not prove his Charge in any one Particular.</P>
<P>And the said <HI>John Delavall</HI> hath divers times accused me in publick Meetings, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would prove me to be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, both from my own Books and the Books of Friends.</HI> To which I replyed, That to prove me to be guilty of <HI>Heresie,</HI> and to be no <HI>Quaker,</HI> he ought first to begin with the Scripture, and prove me guilty of Heresie from the Scripture, and then let him proceed to prove it from my own and Friends Books.</P>
<P><HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> replyed in the publick Meeting, <HI>We are not to prove it from Scripture, but from Books Friends; for the Question betwixt us and</HI> G. K. <HI>is not, who is the best</HI> Christian, <HI>but who is the best</HI> Quaker.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000641_0003_0FA9626A38AF1008"/><HI>G. K.</HI> answered, If I am a good <HI>Christian</HI> I am a good <HI>Quaker,</HI> see∣ing the <HI>Quakers</HI> own themselves to be nothing else but true <HI>Christians.</HI> And also seeing, that we profess to own the Scriptures, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to all other Writings, ye ought to begin with the Scripture, and from them prove me to be guilty of <HI>Heresie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Delavall</HI> did f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther accuse me, <HI>That my Heresie and Error was in a Fundamental Doctrine of the</HI> Quakers, <HI>in saying, The Light within is not sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not something else.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. K.</HI> answered, I am glad to find the Controversie at last come to this plain issue, that ye and we differ in Doctrine, which ye would not acknowledge publickly before, but generally said, ye had nothing a∣gainst my Doctrine, but against my Passion, &amp;c. But now it plainly appeareth, that ye have against my Doctrine, and that ye and I differ <HI>Fundamentally.</HI> But however, <HI>John Delavall</HI> hath not proved it from any Friends Books, that I am guilty of Heresie; for tho' <HI>William Penn</HI> saith in the <HI>Christian Quaker, That the Talent or Light within is sufficient in it self to Salvation,</HI> yet he doth not say, it is sufficient without the Man Christ Jesus, and what he did and suffered for us on Earth, and without his present Intercession and Mediation for us in Heaven, which is that so nothing else that I have affirmed to be necessary to our Sal∣vation, together with the Light within, as one entire cause of our Salvation; and I can and dare appeal to <HI>William Penn</HI> in the case, who I hope is a living man, Whether his words bear any such sence, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would impose upon them, to prove me guilty of Heresie in a Funda∣mental Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers?</HI></P>
<P>And for his Charge of <HI>Hatred,</HI> I told them, That it was no sin nor evil to hate mens Errors and Hypocrisie, and to bear a Zealous Testi∣mony against them; nor is it any Reviling to use sharp words of Re∣proof against the Guilty, unless ye will prove that I have falsly accus∣ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in any thing, which ye can never do, tho' they have falsly ac∣cused me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> prove; and therefore both the <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at your door. And ye have not been short in giving hard words against me, but have far exceeded me, as can well be proved.</P>
<P>It may be farther observed, that several first Days one after another <HI>John Delavall</HI> brought to the publick Meeting his Pocket full of Books, interrupting me in my Testimony, and read passages out of the same, pretending he would prove by my own Books, that I contradicted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrine. To which I have answered, That it was an act of
<PB N="7" REF="000641_0004_0FA9626BCDBC0D60"/>
Incivility that both <HI>J. Delavall</HI> and his Brethren were guilty of, (as well as a Breach of the chief Fundamental Law of this Province, than requireth, That no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be disturbed in the practice of his R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gion, tho or a differing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if he profess to believe in Almighty God) for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to leave us, and then again to come in upon us, and in such a rude manner to interrupt and oppose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Testimony (sometimes crying out, We have heard an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> handle such a subject better than thou does▪ other times, Who does not be∣lieve this? what need thou preach this to us? And then again at other times, many of them at once coming out, This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrine <HI>George,</HI> this is not according to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Friends▪) though I have in∣terrupted none of them, nor intend to do; but on the contrary we sent a proposal to their Monthly Meeting, for them and us to confer about it, and see if we could accomodate the matter so as to prevent so great Confusion, and all the answer we could get, was, <HI>That the Spirit of the Lord could not be limitted;</HI> thereby making the Spirit of God the Author of so great Confusion as hath happened amongst us, that a Person of Note, living in <HI>New-York</HI> Province coming into the Meeting, compared it to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-baiting.</P>
<P>And I then told them further, That seeing <HI>John Delavall</HI> did proffer to prove me to contradict my former Doctrine, and to be no <HI>Quaker.</HI> I was most willing, and did desire that a day might be appointed for a Publick Dispute, wherein he might have opportunity to prove his Charge, if he could. To which <HI>John Delavall</HI> positively assented, without any reservation, restriction, or proviso; but sometime after being put in mind of it by me, in a Letter to him, he declined it, by making excuse, that he would dispute with me in publick, providing he had the consent of his Brethren. And on a First Day, some time after. I pressing <HI>J. D.</HI> to perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> said, He would not permit a publick Dispute, left it should occasion a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But let the impartial Reader judge, whether this was not a meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, seeing they so constantly on a first day made Interruptions and Oppo∣sitions to me and my Testimony, which caused greater Confusion than ever was like to happen at a Dispute.</P>
<P>Therefore, seeing that they declined a Dispute, to prove their Charge, I writ a few lines to <HI>J. Delavall,</HI> That whereas he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to be guilty of Heresie and Hatred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to make good his Charge against me. In answer to which he writes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Letter, dated
<PB N="6" REF="000641_0005_0FA9626C51B33C18"/>
the 16 of 10 Month, 1692. in which he doth acknowledge (but very min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngly) that he had charged me with <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>Hatred,</HI> and doth positively lay, [This being a Difference in a Fundamental Doctrine] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to send in writing, what he had to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay on the first head, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That the Light within is not sufficient without something else,</HI> which he call, Heresie.</P>
<P>And in another Letter of his, bearing date the 3d of 11 Month, (referring to his Paper he sent me the 24th of 10 Month,) he saith, <Q>Wherein I have fully proved thee to differ in a Fundamental Do∣ctrine from thy former, and other Friends Writings.</Q> And further to prove me guilty of Heresie, in the said Letter, he giveth his sence of the word <HI>Heresie,</HI> as intended by him, when mentioned in the pub∣lick Meeting. <Q>It is the same (saith he) as the Fathers (so called) defined it: <HI>Heresie</HI> is a mis-belief of some points of Faith, contrary to the Doctrine universaily received in the Church.</Q></P>
<P>To this his Definition of Heresie, out of the Fathers (so called) as he alledged, I replyed to him, in a Letter bearing date the 2d of 12th Month, That his Definition of <HI>Heresie</HI> seemeth rather to be taken out of some <HI>Popish Writer,</HI> than any approved antient Fathers (so called) further adding, That the best way to know what Heresie is, is to ex∣amine it by the Spirit of Truth within, and the Testimony of the Scripture without, and to lay most weight on these two. But what hath been the universal Testimony of the Church in all Ages, or what it is at present, is far more hard and difficult in many things to deter∣mine, and too tedious to enquire into, but however▪ I doubt not but I have more the Consent of the Universal Church for me, than against me, in this particular.</P>
<P>And in his said Paper, bearing date 24 of 10 Mo. 92. wherein he al∣ledgeth, That he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath fully proved me to differ in a Fundamental Do∣ctrine from my former and other Friends Writings, he spendeth most of his Paper, containing about a Sheet and a half in Writing, citing particular Testimonies out of mine and other Friends printed Books, and Particularly my Book of <HI>Universal Grace,</HI> pag. 7, 3, 4, 18, 16, 83, 94. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, called, <HI>The Mystery of the great Where,</HI> Epist. to the Reader by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; p. 19, 20, 21. and <HI>W. Penn</HI> in his part of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Quaker,</HI> p. 36, 85, 86. and <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> in his part of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Quaker,</HI> pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 31. and <HI>Rob. Barclay</HI> in his English <HI>Apology,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 167<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pag. 101, 112, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, &amp; p. 96, 97.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000641_0006_0FA9626D08105C90"/>To this I replyed in two Sheets of Writing, in a very Friendly way, in complyance with <HI>J. Ds</HI> expectation, having said in his Paper, <HI>That he expected my Friendly Reply,</HI> wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> read over again and again all these Testimonies co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected by him, out of mine and other Friends Books, and have diligently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and considered them, and find not the least inconsistency with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and my late or present Doctrine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in print or by word of mouth, nor with the Assertions he draweth from them, rightly understood; As 1<HI>st,</HI> That this Light wherewithal every man is enlightened with, is Christ Jesus; <HI>2dly,</HI> That it is the very Grace of the Gospel, and Object of the Faith thereof (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> chiefly, as with respect to the se∣cond Ministration thereof, the which lyeth hid within the first) <HI>3dly,</HI> That by Belief in the Light, and Obedience thereunto, Salvation is obtained. And I further said, As I can freely appeal to such of them as are alive in the Body, whether their sense of their words bear <HI>J. D's</HI> Construction, so I can sincerely say, it is a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss mistake of his, the Construction he puts upon my words, cited by him out of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> book of <HI>Universal Grace.</HI></P>
<P>And for a Proof that <HI>John Delavall</HI> had put a wrong Construction upon my words, as is my present Assertion, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That the Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in is not sufficient without the Man Christ Jesus, and his Death and Suffer∣ings, and Mediation, &amp;c.</HI> which is that something else (as <HI>J. D.</HI> hath confessed) is understood by me) did contradict the Doctrine in that Book, I did refer for my Vindication to my said Book of <HI>Univers Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part</HI> stating the Controversie, <HI>N. 3, 4, 6.</HI> and <HI>ans. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 25 Obj.</HI> To which <HI>J. D.</HI> hath not given any Reply. And because the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> places to which I have referred for my Vindication, are so plain and evident▪ I earnestly recommend them to the Reader to weigh and consider at their full length, and only shall give a hint of things therein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at present, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sake. In the 3d p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticular of the first part, I treat largely of the <HI>Two inward Ministrations</HI> of the Light within, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> and that both in <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and how the Gospel lay hid within the Law, as within a Vail, even as the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> But this Distinction given by me of the <HI>Two inward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Light, as laid down in my said Book that hath been in print <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 22 Years past, J. D. accuseth as a <HI>Novelty,</HI> as also my other Distinction of <HI>Salvation begun</HI> and <HI>per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected,</HI> according to the first and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="000641_0007_0FA9626DCDF610F0"/>
measures of more Light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> further to be given, sufficiently hinted as, <HI>N.6. 1 part</HI> of said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And in the answer to <HI>Obit. 25</HI> of said Book, I am so far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sufficiency of the Light within, so as to exclude the Man Christ, and the benefit of his out∣ward Coming, Obedience, Death and Sufferings from having a part in our Salvation (together with the Light within) that I do expresly joyn them together, plainly affirming, That they are both sufficient and useful and necessary in their own kind and way, consummating, and being consummated in one another. It can hardly be construed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adverten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in J. D. but rather a willfull &amp; deliberate Omission in him, thus to pass by what made so clearly to vidicate me, in my said Book, that so he might seem to have some Colour to pervert my words to a contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from what was ever intended by me.</P>
<P>And whereas J. D. hath said in his Paper, <HI>That he doth friendly in∣treat me, not to put a wrong Construction on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> words, for accusing me of Heresie, as if lie and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did exclude the Man Christ Jesus from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any part in our Salvation;</HI> and doth oft earnestly affirm, both in his first and second Paper, <HI>That neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor his Brethren exclude the Man Christ from having a part in our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>To this I did answer, in my first Paper, That seeing he doth blame my Assertion, as being a Heresie, That the Light within is not suf∣ficient to Salvation without something else, he must needs hold the Antithesis, or Contradictory, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Light within Is suffici∣ent without any thing else, that is to say, in other equivolent Terms, without any thing <HI>[beside] [more]</HI> or <HI>[other]</HI> as the English Particle <HI>[<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>]</HI> doth signi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie: but this Assertion excludes wholly the Person of Christ, both the Body, and Fullness of Light, Grace and Truth that dwelleth in him, and his Death and sufferings, &amp;c all which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>i. e.</HI> some what other; or beside, or more, than the measure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, tho' Christ within and without is still but one Christ. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊◊〉"/> put him in mind, that Contradictory Propositions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> two Particulars, as some and some, but betwixt one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and the other Universal, the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> therefore for J. D. to say, The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within is suffi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> some what else, is no Contradiction for the Light within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> without Thousands of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> else, but yet not with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every thing else, for then it would exclude the Man Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and Sufferings, from having any part in our Salvation
<PB N="9" REF="000641_0008_0FA9626E945A8688"/>
I further told him, That it could not be said, that the Man Christ was the Light in us, otherwise than by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igurative Speech of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> or <HI>Netonyme</HI> or <HI>Allegory.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas <HI>John Delavall</HI> did mainly blame my Assertion, <HI>That the Light within is not sufficient without something else, i. e.</HI> the Man Christ Jesus, 1 <HI>st.</HI> Because I said in my Book of Universal Grate, <HI>That the Light</HI> (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> within) <HI>is the immediate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Christian Faith 2dly,</HI> That I said, <HI>It is inseperable from God and Christ, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Sun are inseperable from the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>To this I replyed, That I did not say, the Light within is the <HI>[Only]</HI> Object, and tho' the Light within, and the Man Christ without and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Light that dwelleth in him, he inseperable one from another, yet the one is not the other; for things may be inseperable, and yet the one not be the other, whereof I gave divers Instances, as Faith and Repentance are inseperable, yet Faith is not Repentance. Remission of Sin and Sanctification are inseperable, yet Sanctification is not Remission of Sin, but some-what else; and Christs glorified Soul and Body are inseperable, yet his Body is not his Soul: The God head and Manhood of Christ are inseperable, yet the Godhead of Christ is not his Manhood: The Measure and Fullness are inseperable, yet the Measure is not the Fullness: The River and Ocean are inseperable, yet the River is not the Ocean; The Beams and the great Body of the sun are inseperable, and yet the Beams are not the great Body of the Sun; Also, the glorified Saints in Heaven and Christ are inseperable, yet they are not Christ, but Christ is some-what else. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I told him in my former Paper, that <HI>G. F. E. B.</HI> and <HI>W.

else that I always affirmed to be concerned in our Salvation, together with the Light within.</P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> J. D. in the last Leaf his first Paper layeth down fix Heads, which he saith, he is willing to controvert with me. To this I replyed, that the four first of these Heads I will not controvert with him, for they are a part of my Testimony, and always owned by me, rightly understood; and for the two last, I will readily controvert with him, after the Controversie about the Light is ended.</P>
<P>And in my first Paper I did further inform J. D. That my assertion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Light within is not sufficient without something else;</HI> that something else being the Man Christ Jesus, and his Obedience, Death and Sufferings, Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation for us in Hea∣ven, doth no wise infer the Light its being not sufficient; and for J.D. to think it doth so infer, proceedeth from either his great Weakness or Inadvertency, not considering the Signification of such or the like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Propoutions, giving diversful Examples, and particu∣larly he that saith, Man is not sufficient without the Grace of God, to work out his Salvation, doth not deny man to be sufficient or able to do it, with and by the help of Gods Grace; and therefore, he who saith, the Grace of Christ or Light within is not sufficient to save us without the Man Christ, doth not deny the Grace and Light of Christ is sufficient, together with him. I further saying, That as God in∣finitely wise hath ordained divers concurring Natural Causes to pro∣duce one Natural Effect, all subordinate to him, the first and highest Cause; so to effect our Salvation he hath ordained divers concurring Causes; some without us and some within us, and every one sufficient and able in their manner and way of working, to answer to the end and effect, all in Harmony together.</P>
<P>And because J. D. in his former Papers had not stated aright the matter of Difference betwixt him and me, as concerning the sufficiency of the Light within to Salvation, therefore I did state my Perswasion concerning the sufficiency of the Light, and also concerning the Scrip∣tures being sufficient to afford us words whereby to express our Faith in all matters of Christian Doctrine, in twelve several particulars. To which, as yet, J.D. hath sent no particular Reply; therefore as to that the matter rests at present. And this is a brief account of the most material Passages in the first Paper that J. D. sent to me, and in the Reply that I made unto his said first Paper.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000641_0010_0FA962700E1FCC88"/>In answer to my first Paper, which was writ is a very fair &amp; friendly manner to <HI>John Delavall,</HI> he sendeth me a second Paper, by way of Reply, containing many bitter Expressions, unfriendly Reflections and false Accusations, too tedious here to relate, but which will sufficiently appear, if the Paper happen to be printed, most grosly mis-applying that place of Scripture to me, <HI>Ezeh. 18. 24.</HI> as if I were turned a wicked man; And why? because of my zealously opposing his and their Anti-Christian Doctrine, and detecting their Hypocrisie, Igno∣rance and Errors, even as Friends in <HI>England</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their opposing and detecting the Ignorance, Errors and Hypocrisie of their Oppose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>To m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former Reply, that I said, The Light, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> within) is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> J. D. doth answer, in his second Paper, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> where I blame our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they do not hold it (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the divine Illumination of Christ within) to be the <HI>immediate Object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Christian Faith.</HI></P>
<P>To this I answered, in my 2d Paper, That to say the Light within is the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Object of the Christian Faith,</HI> is not to say, it is the <HI>Only Object of the Christian Faith,</HI> excluding the Man Christ Jesus, and his Death and Sufferings, Resurrection, As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ention, and Mediation for us in Heaven, which are owned generally by Friends, yea, and by J. D. though in Contradiction to himself, to be also the Objects of our Christian Faith, seeing he expresly granteth, That he and his Brethren do believe in the Man Christ Jesus, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> saying, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Unbelief not to believe these things where declared. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Note, R.

D. were not blinded with Prejudice, he would see there is not the least Inconsistency here. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the word <HI>Object</HI> is not a Scripture word, yet it is used not only by <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> but by <HI>J.

upon all to believe; and then let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> know their Method of Distinction, who preach not the Gospel to every one, for sure there can be no Gospel of Glad Tidings to them Christ dyed not for.</HI> Thus <HI>John Burnyeat:</HI> Where it is plain, that he understandeth Christs dying for all to be the <HI>Object of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faith,</HI> and a Doctrine of the Gospel, as well as that he doth in∣wardly enlighten all, as it was of that Gospel which▪ <HI>Paul</HI> preached, as it doth plainly appear from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 1, 23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 8, 9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 23, 24, 25. and many other places. And I put J. D. in mind how at the school-house Meeting, about 12 Months past, he brought the fore-cited place, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 9, 8. in opposition to <HI>T. Lloyd,</HI> his Father∣in-Law, to prove that it was not sufficient to Salvation, to believe only in the Light within, but to believe also that Christ dyed &amp; rose again; And to this, as to other things, I expect his particular Answer.</P>
<P>And I say still, that Christs inwardly enlightening all, is a Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Object of our Faith, as well as that Christ dyed for all. But I was so far from denying Christs coming the Flesh, and his Death, and Sufferings, to be any part of the Object of the Christian Faith, in that Treatise of <HI>Universal Grace,</HI> cited by J. D. that pag. 92. I particularly mention <HI>Christs Coming in the Flesh, his Miraculous birth is Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascention, &amp;c.</HI> as being things of the Christian Faith and Religion, which the Light within brings us to own; and the same upon the matter is confessed by J. D. in both his Papers: How then am I guilty of Heresie, for saying the same that J. D. faith?</P>
<P>To my saying, that J. D. his blaming my Assertion, as being Heresie, (<ABBR>viz</ABBR> <HI>That the Light within is not sufficient without something else</HI>) doth oblige him to hold the Antithesis or Contradictory Assertion, <HI>That the Light within is sufficient without any thing else.</HI> J. D. Replyeth, <HI>That is but my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and none of his words.</HI> To which I replyed, That some affirm, they heard him say so, in so many words; but suppose he did not say it, yet seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hath accused me of the former, the necessary &amp; unavoidable Consequence of his words makes it to be his, and to deny this, is to be guilty of the greatest T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifflig and Non-fence that ever I knew in any pretending to common Reason: His scur∣rilous Reflection upon me, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my School-Craft, as he calls it, I pass over, not valuing it, being conscious of my sincerity, and which I freely leave to the Impartial to judge.</P>
<P>For a Proof that <HI>W. Penn</HI> layeth not our whole Salvation upon the
<PB N="13" REF="000641_0012_0FA962729BB06CB8"/>
Light within only, as sufficient without the Man Christ Jesus, I did cite <HI>W. P.</HI> in answer to <HI>J. Faldo,</HI> part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. pag. 243. <HI>J. Faldo</HI> charging it upon the <HI>Quakers, That they expect to be saved by the Light within only▪ W. P.</HI> answers in behalf of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> This is a wicked Suggestion against us; see also his following words. And as I said to J. D. in my 2d Paper, Now let the Impartial Reader judge, who hath any thing of common Reason, Whether by these words <HI>W. Penn</HI> doth not Plainly declare his Mind, <HI>That we are not saved by the Light within without some∣thing else?</HI> For as the word <HI>Only</HI> is exclusive, so are the words <HI>With∣out something else.</HI></P>
<P>And here let it be noted, that <HI>John Delavall</HI> finding that he could not make good his Charge against me, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> his accusing me of Heresie for saying, <HI>The Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not sufficient without something else,</HI> he goeth about (most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) to change the state of the Question; for whereas the state of the Question was, <HI>Whether the Light within was sufficient to Salvation without something else,</HI> <ABBR>viz</ABBR> <HI>without the Man Christ Jesus, and is Death and Sufferings, and present Intercession for us in Hea∣ven,</HI> he goeth about (not so slyly as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) quite to alter and change it to another Question, altogether different from the former, as <HI>Whether any can be perfectly saved &amp; made perfectly happy without all know∣ledge and faith of the Man Christ Jesus without us, and of his Death and Sufferings, &amp;c?</HI></P>
<P>To which I have answered him in my second Paper, That these two are quite differing Questions; for if this last should be granted, yet it still remaineth, that the Light within only, without the Man Christ Jesus, doth not save any; for even many who do not know him, nor believe in him (having some measure of sincerity under the first Mini∣stration of the Light within them) receive the benefit of his Death, and Sufferings, and Mediation (by the general acknowledgment of all that ever I have formerly known of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI>) at least in some measure to begin a good work in them, as is clear in the case of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> before he received the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again; and therefore, as I have told <HI>J. D.</HI> he will sooner wash an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> until he be white, than he can prove me guilty of <HI>Heresie</HI> or <HI>Error,</HI> for affirming, <HI>The Light is not sufficient with∣out something else,</HI> either according to Scripture or sound Friends. But to say, <HI>The knowledge and Faith of Christ, both as he is God and Man, and as he dyed for our sins, and rose again for our Justification, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="000641_0013_0FA96273173112A0"/>
Mediator in Heaven, even the Man Christ Jesus, is necessary to finish and perfect the Salvation and Eternal Happiness of all that shall be Eternally saved,</HI> This doth no wayes derogate from the sufficiency of the <HI>Light within,</HI> for the Light within being God and Christ, is abundantly sufficient to reveal this Knowledge and Faith in all them who shall be saved, and that either without or with means, as God pleaseth, tho' in Gods ordinary way of working, he maketh use of outward means; and therefore if any have not the <HI>Knowledge and Faith of Christ cru∣cified,</HI> as outwardly, this doth no more prove, that the <HI>Light is not sufficient in it self,</HI> than if any have not the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience of the Light inwardly,</HI> doth prove that the Light is not sufficient; for as J. D. hath confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in his first Paper, <HI>Faith and Obedience are the blessed Effects produced by the sufficiency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is true Fol∣lowers;</HI> So that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> with respect to the Light, are not the Cause of its Sufficiency, tho' it Then only comes to be sufficient to us, when we believe in it, and obey it. And thus, what J.D. affirms with respect to the <HI>Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> I affirm also, with respect to <HI>the Man Christ without us, as he dyed and rose again, and is our Intercessor in Heaven;</HI> for, as not to believe in the Light within, is no argument of its <HI>Insufficiency,</HI> so not to believe in the <HI>Man Christ without us,</HI> is no argument <HI>that the Light within is not sufficient to mens Salvation uni∣versally,</HI> because the Light within being a real measure of the eternal Word, <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> can as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reveal the <HI>Faith of the Man Christ without, and of his Death and Sufferings, &amp;c.</HI> as it can reveal the <HI>Faith of Christ within,</HI> both which J.D. doth acknowledge to be necessary to all such to whom it is preached or declared, for their Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>John Delavall`s</HI> silly Taunt and Reflection, <HI>That I cause him not to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ggar by my profound Logick,</HI> (as he terms it) I regard not, furder, (as I told him in my 2d Paper) but to take notice of his scoffing Spirit, more like <HI>Ishmael</HI> than a true <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>true Minister of Christ:</HI> I used no profound Logick in the case, but one or two of the easiest and plainest Rules in that ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Logick, belonging to the Rudiments of it, and as I told him, true Reason teacheth it, without all Art of Logick; but J.

<P>His accusing me of <HI>Pride, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Rage,</HI> I told him, is one of the Unclean Streams that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow from his Unclean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountain; &amp; so I pass it,

<P>I also told him, his positively charging me with that he calleth <HI>my late modelied Doctrine of the Revolutions,</HI> is a base and vile Forgery and Calumny, which I have sufficiently answered in my printed Treatise, called, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Innocency, &amp;c.</HI> I never made that (vulgarly) call'd the <HI>Revolutions,</HI> any matter of any <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and no man living can justly say, that ever I did: I can defend my <HI>Christian Faith</HI> with∣out the <HI>Doctrine of the Revolutions,</HI> as well as all other true <HI>Christians</HI> can, who are of the same Faith with me concerning the <HI>Necessity of the Knowledge and Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Salvation.</HI> Nor hath the Doctrine of the <HI>two Ministrations,</HI> and of <HI>Salvation began,</HI> and <HI>Salvation perfected,</HI> a dependance on the <HI>Revolutions,</HI> so called, whe∣ther true or false; for what hath a dependance on another, is the Effect of that other; but the <HI>two Ministrations of the Light within,</HI> and the <HI>Work of our Salvation,</HI> both in its beginning and finishing, have no other Cause but <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and therefore wholly depend thereupon. And I freely at any time proffer to defend my Perswal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on and Faith concerning the <HI>Two Ministrations,</HI> and <HI>Salvation begun</HI> and <HI>finished,</HI> without running either to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Purgatory,</HI> or the Hypothesis of the <HI>Revolutions;</HI> and let <HI>John Delavall</HI> or any of his Associates, try their strength, whether they can drive me, by the force of their Arguments to any such pinch or strait, as he doth basely in∣sinuate against me in his 2d Paper. And his Accusations in this par∣ticular do not only strike against me▪ but <HI>G.F.E.B. W.P.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom I can Prove to hold the distinction of <HI>two inward Ministrations of the Light,</HI> and <HI>two states of Men,</HI> answering thereunto, the first of which G.

<PB N="16" REF="000641_0015_0FA962748996ECF0"/>
know before the World began, and Reprobation since the World began.</HI> And these two states <HI>W. Penn</HI> plainly distinguisheth in his part of the <HI>Chr. Quaker,</HI> calling the one that of the <HI>Law,</HI> the other that of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the one that of a <HI>Servant,</HI> the other that of a <HI>Son;</HI> and <HI>E. Burrough</HI> saith, pag. 56. of his Works in folio, <HI>The Law must have its thorow O∣peration, before the Gospel be witnessed.</HI> It is therefore manifest that <HI>John Delavall</HI> is greatly Ignorance, as in the holy Scriptures, so in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, so to fault my Testimony concerning the <HI>two Mi∣nistrations,</HI> and <HI>Salvation begun</HI> and <HI>Salvation finished,</HI> which <HI>perfect Salvation</HI> (according to G.

<P>And whereas J.

To this I have ans∣wered. That all these are Contradictory, being either betwixt <HI>de∣finite Particulars,</HI> or such as contain necessary matter of Truth and Falshood, and therefore are strictly Contradictory; but Propositions betwixt <HI>Indefinite Particulars,</HI> as <HI>some</HI> and <HI>some,</HI> are never Contradi∣ctory nor Contrary, nor have the least Inconsistency, when the matter of them is not any necessary Truth and Falshood, but are both True, as is the present case in our Debate; for as it is true, <HI>That the Light within is [Nor] sufficient without something else,</HI> that something else being the Man Christ Jesus, and his Death and Sufferings, and Inter∣cession for us in Heaven, so is it also true, <HI>That the Light within [Is] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of some other things else.</HI> And if <HI>Jo.

And in any 2d Paper I put him in∣mind of the common Proverb, <HI>Let not the shoesmaker go beyond his Last,</HI> not that I upbraid him with his Ignorance in the Art of Logick, but for his <HI>Pedantick Vanity,</HI> that he would seem to know what he is as ignorant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Child.</P>

<P>To his blaming me for saying, <HI>The Man Christ was the Light in us, was a figurative Speech of Synecdoche, Netonyme or Allegory.</HI> I answered him, That seeing he blames me for this, according to him, the Man Christ is within us, wholly, both Soul and Body, without all figure, with all his Fullness; which is as gross a Doctrine as the <HI>Papist▪</HI> is con∣cerning the Man Christ being in the consecrated Cake.

<P>And notwithstanding that <HI>John Delavall</HI> hath made an absolute and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Appeal to antient Friends in <HI>Old England,</HI> to determine in this case, I cannot easily be perfwaded, that after they have fully heard the Case truly stated betwixt J.

Therefore I hope God will put it into the hearts of faithful Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and else-where, zealously to withstand this most pernicious Anti-Christian Doctrine of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>And tho' J.

Beside, if he doth not exclude him from having a part in our Salvation, as neither do I, but include him, then in what part of my Assertion lodgeth the <HI>Heresie,</HI> that he hath cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged upon me, for saying, <HI>The Light is not sufficient without something else,</HI> I con∣felling, that by something else, I neither understand Humane Learn∣ning, nor the Letter of the Scripture, nor outward Preaching, as absolutely and universally necessary, but the <HI>Man Christ Jesus?</HI> And as great a Contradiction is it in J. D. to blame me for cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging him, <HI>That he holdeth the Measure to be sufficient without the Fullness;</HI> for if he holds not this, he must needs hold, <HI>That the Light within is not sufficient without the Fullness,</HI> that is something else than the measure of the Light within, or then he must hold two Contradictory Propositions to be false, as thus,</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="000641_0019_0FA9627ACFA1CCF0"/><HI>It is false to say, The Light is [Not] sufficient without the Fullness,</HI></P>
<P>And</P>
<P><HI>It is false to say, The Light [is] sufficient without the Fullness.</HI></P>
<P>Which is an absolute Contradiction to all common Reason of Man∣kind; and I do solemnly say, that of all the Adversaries I ever had to do with in Dispute, I never met with a more Ignorant or more Un∣reasonable Adversary. And tho in a Letter to me (wherein he is con∣cerned with some others) he falsly chargeth me, <HI>as being either Crased, &amp;c.</HI> I appeal to all impartial Readers of common Reason, Whether ever they heard or knew a man that seemeth more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than he. And to me it seemeth a Judgment of God upon him, to be so bewildered and confounded in his common Sense and Reason as a man, for daring to oppose so great a Christian Truth asserted by me, a poor Servant of the Lord, and to call it Heresie, he having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and more than ordinary appeared but of late to joyn with me in the same Testimony, as I told him in my former Paper, how by his charging me with He∣resie, he had unministred himself.

<P>To his saying, in his second Paper to me, <HI>My Answer, that things which are inseperable yet are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, giveth me no Relief.</HI> I answered him, I need no Relief in the Cafe, my Examples were proper and pertinent▪ as that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> are inseperable, and yet we are not saved by <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Repentance,</HI> which he in his Ignorance la∣boureth to render Ridiculous, by the Addition of his own wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, making them a Tautology. But he altogether passeth by my Example how <HI>Christs Godhead</HI> and <HI>Manhood</HI> are inseperable; and yet it is most congruous and proper to say, <HI>The Man Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> save us without his Godhead,</HI> which Christ taught himself, expresly saying, <HI>I can do no∣thing of my self, i.e.</HI> without my Father. Also, it doth no more infer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I deny the sufficiency of the Light within, because I say it is not sufficient without the Man Christ without us, than it inferreth, that he that saith, <HI>John Delavall</HI> is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man without his Soul, denyeth J.
