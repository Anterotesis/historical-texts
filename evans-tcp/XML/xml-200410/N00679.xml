<P>ALthough to name but the Authors of this Pamphlet, to give account of the time, manner, and design of its Publication, would sufficiently co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fute it; and were it all Truth, take away its Credit: Yet I shall first by plain proof of Fact and Reason, disabuse whom it may have imposed on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and then expose the Seducers themselves whose corrupt minds gave birth to this <HI>Ignis fatuus.</HI></P>
<P>I know the Authors have triumph'd, that their Libel hath not hither∣to been answered; but they will have but little cause, when they con∣sider it required some time to recover the damp and stunn given to honest minds, by the late corrupt Government of <HI>New-York</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it: and some time will always be naturally taken up for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of joy; that truth and honesty will now have their turn of being pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tected by Authority.</P>
<P>It was with great dread known, that the late K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <HI>James</HI> was bound in Conscience to indeavour to Damn the English Nation to Popery and Slavery, and therefore no wonder (since he made such large steps to∣wards

it in his Kingdom's) that he took a particular care of this Province, of which he was Proprietor, &amp; at one jump leapt over all the bounds, &amp; Laws of <HI>English</HI> Right and Governm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt; and appointed a Governour of this Province of <HI>New York,</HI> who (although he was a person of large indowments of mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et) gave active Obedience to his Prince without reserve; and accepted of a Commission now on record in the Secretarys Office, giving him power with consent of any Seven of his Council to make Laws and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aise Taxes (as the <HI>French</HI> King doth) without consent of the People, (for the Council) are no body, but whom he pleases to name, and therefore could represent nothing but the Kings pleasure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hereby the will of the Prince became the Law; and the estates of the Subjects became the Kings property. And this Governour and Council were the tools to inslave their Country, who pursuant to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Com∣mission did make Laws and Assessed Taxes accordingly, without any Representatives of the People, as appears by the Records of the Council book.</P>
<P>This <HI>French</HI> Government being thus (by Commission) introduced, it was natural that Papist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be employed in the highest Trusts; such as the Council, the Revenue, and the Military Forces; and since no Law was left alive to make them unqualifyed, therefore this Obedient Governour admitted major <HI>Brockholse</HI> and major <HI>Baxter.</HI> into the Coun∣cil; <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tthew Plowman</HI> to be Collector of the Revenue, and said <HI>Baxter</HI> and <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to Command Military Forces; all professed Papists to assist in making Arbitrary Placats, and forcing Obedience to them from a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣testant free People.</P>
<P>This was the condition of <HI>New York,</HI> the Slavery and Popery that it lay under, until the Hand of Heaven sent the glorious King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> to break those chains, which would otherwise have fetter'd all <HI>Europe.</HI> And these were the reasons that moved the Gentlemen concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Revolution of <HI>New York,</HI> to be early in shaking off their Tyrants, and declaring for their Deliverer.</P>
<P>These things premised do make way for the answer to the bold As¦sertions of the Libeller, who had the Author Printed the Letter ten ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, <HI>viz</HI> the time of the Revolution, he would have come under the penalty of spreading false News, which he in particular knows, in <HI>Scotland</HI> is call'd <HI>Leesing,</HI> and deserves the death call'd the <HI>Maiden.</HI></P>

And was ever Revolution made wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out them?

<P>We are told the Lieutenant Governour and Council were <HI>Protestants,</HI> and perhaps they were; and so were <HI>Friend, Perkins, Jefferys, Herbert,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Brian Haynes</HI> the player; therefore that is no in∣fallible Test that they were well affected to the Revolution, if they had no other. <HI>But they resolved</HI> Thereupon <HI>to suspend all</HI> Roman Catholicks <HI>from Command and pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of trust in the Government.</HI> Well resolved, though they did not perform it, as the Libeller afterwards owns. But what means the word [<HI>Thereupon] i. e.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> was fled into <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000824_0004_0FAB42266C6A7008"/>
the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was Arrived with considerable Forces in <HI>England,</HI> and by consent and voice of the Nation declared their Deliverer and King: and since King <HI>James</HI> could not stand by them, and the Arbi∣trary Commissions he had given them, and <HI>Old England</HI> would be sure to Command <HI>New-York: Thereupon they</HI> &amp;c. No thanks to them for their <HI>Thereupon.</HI> Besides if I am not mistaken▪ the execution of their Illegal Commissions (which they held as long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>) and their fear of exasperations they had justly given to the People, by being Volun∣tary slaves to King <HI>James</HI> his Will, and Authorised to make all under them to be likewise so: (as the Devils would have all men Damn'd with themselves.) For these reasons these faint resolve, were made and ill executed. But we do not find that <HI>Thereupon</HI> they declared for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or the Protestant Religion No, these Gentlemen had sub∣mitted so intirely to such a blind Obedience to their Prince as (not∣withstanding their Profession) was never practis'd by any Christians, but the Papists; and think to hide their nakedness by the fig leaf of turning a single Papist out of the Council, just as their Master King <HI>James</HI> did, when the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was landing; the Nations hearts alienated from him, and his standing Army likely to run over to the Prince: <HI>Thereupon,</HI> he restored the Charters of Corporations, and <HI>Mag∣dalen</HI> Colledge of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and declared to call a free Parliament: Just with the same good will as these New-York <HI>Thereupon-men. [Pag</HI> 4.] But it is notoriously false and known to be so by the Inhabitants of <HI>New-York,</HI> that <HI>Thereupon</HI> these disbanded Papists forthwith left the Province: For <HI>Baxter</HI> stay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d here several Moneths, not knowing whether it was a real Revolution or no; and <HI>Russel</HI> stay'd and dyed in <HI>New-York,</HI> but <HI>Plowman</HI> continued fix'd in the greatest Trust of Collector of the Re∣venue, being intrusted by the Protestant Lieutenant Governour and Council with the sinews of War in his management, who would be sure as a strict <HI>Papist</HI> to employ it in the service of a <HI>Protestant</HI> Revolution, from the same good affection with themselves.</P>
<P>To proceed, this Libeller names three Dutch Gentlemen of their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncil, and tells you <HI>that but two of them were moct affectionate to the Royal house of</HI> Orange, although Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> (I believe) had the same affection with the rest: but the Libeller never tells you, that any of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleased that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had rescued from ruine our English Laws, Liberties and Protestant Religion, and was become a Royal English King: which was but a small reward to Him for the
<PB N="5" REF="000824_0005_0FAB42272C83C850"/>
Blessing it gave us: he only tells us, that as <HI>Dutchmen</HI> they loved the Royal house of <HI>Orange</HI>: So, I presume the late King <HI>James</HI> doth, be∣ing tyed by blood thereto; although the wishes him far enough from <HI>England.</HI> I suppose those <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentlemen will give the Libeller few thanks for his remark on them. He adds, <HI>that the said Lieutenant Go∣vernour and Council Convened to their Assistance, all the Justices of the Peace and Civil Magistrates, and Military Officers.</HI> But they had quite for∣got the <HI>English</HI> Constitution of calling the Representatives of the Peo∣ple: and whereas several of this Convention were the Persons that were pitched upon, and thought fit by the then Arbitrary Government to have Commission, Office and Power to enslave the Subject. No won∣der the People did not think themselves safe in their hands, to be managed by the major Vote of such a Convention.</P>
<P>Neither was the first thing they ordered, <HI>viz. Fortifying the City of</HI> New-York, any wise satisfa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; since it was most proper that those persons who gave occasion for a Revolution, were most probable to make themselves strong to oppose it. And therefore Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> made Coll. of the Militia by King <HI>James,</HI> was most liable to obey and execute King <HI>James's</HI> order, and an unsure Security for the Fort; Especially having so often declared in Words, and Letters, under his own hand to Mr. <HI>West &amp;c. That those who were in Arms for the Prince of</HI> Orange <HI>were Rebels.</HI> But it is absolutely false, that Coll. <HI>Bayards</HI> in∣dustry fortifyed the Fort; for Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> opened the Well, which was closed up; he it was ordered the Batteries, that were made about the Town, he mended the Breast works of the Fort, as likewise the Plat∣forms, and Powder Room; all which were in a miserable Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and these great works took up near a Twelve Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eths time, with Vigorous application and industry of the Inhabitants, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Bayard</HI> was out of the Power of betraying the Fort, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never have been defended in the posture he kept it, with no W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, nor any cover∣ing for it, defence or security for thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when the Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itia Forces were on guard in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour in Passion alte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed their Orders given by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them, <HI>if they gave him any further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> Im∣prooved by the Depositions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>] And for their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Revenue, as being very useful for men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for their cause.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000824_0006_0FAB4227EF2634A8"/>It matters not what Letters were sent home by the Lieutenant Go∣vern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, for it is plain neither Governour nor Council would declare for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> pretending they wanted Orders; No, they wanted good wil; for without Orders this Libeller pretends they turned out <HI>Banter</HI> and <HI>Russel</HI> out of Commission. I wonder how they dared to go so far, and no farther. But no body but themselves know or care whither they Wrote or no, for it signifyed nothing, except to excuse themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom declaring till an answer came, and they knew who was upperm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st I suppose they had a mind to stay to see who got the better in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before they would declare.</P>
<P>[<HI>Pag.</HI> 6.] A lying building must have a lying foundation, &amp; there∣fore the Libeller says, <HI>That Capt.</HI> Leisler <HI>unwilling to pay the Duty of his Wines, stirred up the People to Rebellion.</HI> The case was thus, the Popish Collector <HI>Plowman</HI> was then continued in Office, and Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> did, even with him, make Entry in the Custom house for his Wines, and ingaged to pay the Customs to such as should be legally qualified to receive them; which the Papist <HI>Plowman</HI> was not.</P>
<P>And now the People being exasperated by the delay of the Gover∣nour and Council to declare for the Prince, the greater body of the Militia with their Officers, did Seize on the Fort, and did send and demand the Keyes from the Lieutenant Governour; and since they had taken the Government on them, they did Seize what Publick Moneys they could find; and took the <HI>Seven hundred Seventy three Pounds</HI> from Coll. <HI>Nicholson,</HI> which with great prudence they did Expend for the safety and defence of the Revolution: nor <HI>were the People Drunk or Mad</HI>: for no Man, Woman, or Child, was hurt by them even in the very Convulsion of changing the Government; nay the very Papists then in Office and others who were justly suspected of designs of be∣traying the Country to King <HI>James's</HI> faithful Allie, the <HI>French</HI> King had not a hair hurt, except by the fright their own guilt occasioned; and these Revolutioners must either be very sober or loving in their drink, or these <HI>Jacobites</HI> had never scap'd being <HI>Dewitted</HI> by a suffi∣ciently provoked People, who had the Power, but more grace than to use it.</P>
<P>False Assertions without proof are sufficiently answered by denying them This northern forehead answers himself: for the Libeller says, <HI>the people cry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out that they disowned all Government,</HI> and in the next line
<PB N="7" REF="000824_0007_0FAB4228ACFEFB60"/>
tells you, <HI>they proclaimed Capt.</HI> Leisler <HI>their Commander.</HI> But I suppose he gives this contradiction as a proof of the Peoples being drunk; to be against all manner of Government, and choose a Governour in the same breath. 'Tis likewise notoriously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that no other Commission'd Officer was amongst them: for most of the Officers of the Militia of the City joyned therein: But had it been true, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Leisler</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> only Commission Officer ought to Command them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> just and sober in their choice, as well as prudent in their Trust of so good and faithful a Person But the fact of this was false, for Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> though instrumental in shaking off the Tyrannical Government, did not believe he had a Title to govern longer than the Peoples Resolutions were known; and therefore circular Letters were carryed by Coll. <HI>Depeyster</HI> and Capt. <HI>De Brayn</HI> to the several Counties; whose Freeholders chose their Representatives, who being met appointed Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> Commander in Chief under their Hands and Seals, and appointed several to be of his Council, under the name of a Committee of Safety to preserve the Publick Peace of the Province: Who did i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so effectually, that those divested of the Governing power had no other harm done to their persons; and the late Lieutenant Governour was permitted to withdraw himself whither he pleased.

<HI>Bayard</HI> was put in Irons, as he well deserved for his aversion to the Revolution, disturbing the Peace, and attacking Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> (then Commander in Chief) in the open Street, as appears by several credible Oaths. Nor could it be safe to admit such fire∣brands to Bail; and therefore they were kept close from doing mischief, which is the part of all good Governments to do, and was most necessary in this Revolution.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Leisler</HI> with the Committee of safety (appointed by the Representatives of the Freeholders of the several Counties of the Province) having published their Declaration for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> the Protestant Religion, and the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Liberties, they thought it prudent to discriminate the Well affected from the Enemy, and therefore Summoned all the Inhabitants of the City to the Fort, to sign their names to such a Declaration as owned the Authority of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> And the refusers must justly by him and all mankind be deemed Enemies to the Revolution, to His Majesty, and their Country. And is this a crime to know the Sheep from the Goats, or to take all Reasonable methods for the safety of the then Government: but the Libeller is angry at every pru∣dent step was taken, nor is he satisfyed, although it is above Seven years since he was gorg'd with their innocent blood which he had a hand in shedding.</P>
<P>It is notoriously false that Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> opposed the Collecting of the Revenue; indeed he was not willing a Papist should run away with our Protestant Kings Money, nor did he think it safe in <HI>Bayards &amp;c</HI> hands.

<P>'Tis true Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> sent to the Merchants of the Town to sup∣ply the Garrison with Provisions and other necessaries, and sent with∣out distinction to all People who had Stores; otherwise the Garrison might have perished: but he honestly gave them Credit in the Kings Books, and they have since (for the greatest part) been satisfyed; and Capt. <HI>Leisler</HI> (as he ought) did order forceibly to break their Ware-houses open, where they were refractory, and refused on so great Emergency to afford support for the Government; but exact Accompts were kept of all such goods, and Entries made in Books kept for that purpose; so that it was not plunder, (as the Libeller falsely calls it) but they were to be satisfyed, and paid for the same. And I believe it was never known in the Memory of man, that ever a Re∣volution, or change of Government, was more regular: or where Mili∣tary power would not force Victuals where it was denyed them, when they wanted it: and therefore it was for the special Service of King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> to keep alive those that were the only persons in that Province, who declared early for Them, and owned Their Authority.
