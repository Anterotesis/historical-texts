<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Prophet having in the conclusion of the preceding Chapter, in the Name of God, denounced heavy Judgement to come upon the Apostate Church of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> he doth proceed in this Chapter to speak by way of Consolation to the godly remnant amongst them; And for that end doth put them in mind of a most gracious and glori∣ous promise; under which we have, 1. The persons concerned, or the Subject of this promise, <HI>viz</HI> The <HI>Israel</HI> of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Yet hear now O Iacob my Servant, and Israel whom I have chosen,</HI> Who are described from their political birth. <HI>ver·</HI> 2 <HI>Thus saith the Lord, that made and formed thee from the womb.</HI> The Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> considered as a Church and State,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gatak: in locum English Anno∣tations Iosh</HI>: 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> were born in the day when the Lord brought them out of <HI>Egypt</HI>; they were then formed to be a people for himself; The Lord moulded them up in∣to a proportionable frame of Churc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and State; for which cause did the children of <HI>Israel</HI> begin their Religious Account, (albeit their civil Account b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan six Months before that) from the time of the year when they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> since that then they seemed to begin their life. And then they were a <HI>Ieshurun, Thou I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shurun, h. e.</HI> a righteous People as to their consti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution and pro∣fession, according to the signification of the name <HI>Ieshurun</HI>; they were wholly a right seed, under most righteous Laws. 2 We have the blessing promised in the 3<HI>d.</HI> verse: And it is first express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, then explained. It is expressed in the former part of the verse, <HI>I will pour water upon the thirsty,</HI> (so the verse should be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d) <HI>and
<PB N="6" REF="000255_0005_0FA4103555A726E0"/>
floods upon the dry ground</HI>: alluding partly unto plentiful showrs whereby the thirsty Earth is made fruitful, and partly unto rivers such as <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the floods and seasonable overflowing whereof do enrich the earth: the promise is explained in the lat¦ter part of the verse, the words that are before us to insist on. <HI>will pour my spirit and my blessing,</HI> h. e. that wonderful blessing of the Spirit: They are spiritual waters which are here spoken of▪ No other showrs then those that come down from the third, and highest heaven: and this promise is further illustrated from the blessed extent of it, in that, not only Parents, but Children are concerned therein. On thy Seed <HI>i. e.</HI> thy Children, and on <HI>thine Off-spring,</HI> i. e. Posterity as some render the word, <HI>Hebr. I will pour my blessing upon thy young spriggs.</HI> The Children of Gods Servants, that spring from them, and must succeed when they are dead and gone out of the world, are intended by this expression.</P>
<P>Concerning the fulfilment of this promise, this (as well as many other Scriptures which are prophetical, and promissary) doth ad∣mit of a Typical and Partial, as also an Antitypical, and more ple∣nary Accomplishment. The Lords people whilest in <HI>Babylon</HI> were like unto dry and desolate ground; but the Lord received them afterwards, and brought them into a flourishing estate, and there was a glorious work of the Spirit of God in that matter, <HI>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And there will be a more glorious accomplishment of this Pro∣phecy and Promise, when God shall pour out a Spirit of convert∣ing Grace upon the body of the Israelitish Nation.</P>
<P>Moreover, the words being a special branch of the Covenant of Grace, which God hath established with his Servants and with their Children, Gentiles are concerned therein as well as Jews; for upon them is come the blessing of <HI>Abraham</HI> by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr. Owen of the Spi∣rit.</HI> p. 87</NOTE>And indeed the words have special reference unto New-Testa∣ment-times, which is also intimated by that expression of pouring the Spirit: God is said to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve his Spirit, under the Old-Testa∣ment, but it is very observable, that he is not said to pour his Spi∣rit on men, except in the New-Testament, or in Scriptures that do refer to the dayes of the Gospel.</P>
<P>The Doctrine which we may take up from the Words, is,
<PB N="7" REF="000255_0006_0FA4103A095A4598"/><HI>Doct.</HI> That one of the greatest blessings promised in the Cove∣nant of Grace, is, That the Lord will pour his Spirit upon the Children and Posterity of his Servants.</P>
<P>Now for the clearing of this Doctrine, four things may be enquired into? (1) What is here meant by the Spirit? (2) What is implyed in this pouring the Spirit. (3) How it doth appear that the pouring of the Spirit upon Children is a great Blessing? (4) The reason why the Lord hath made such a promise.</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>What is here meant by the Spirit?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Spirit is not here taken in a personal sence;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Mr <HI>Cottons Answer to Bayly</HI> p. 36, 37, 38. Dr. <HI>Owen of perse∣verance.</HI> chap. 8.</NOTE> although it be a glorious Truth, that the Holy Ghost himself doth dwell in the hearts of Believers, yet he is not as to his person said to be poured on men; for so he is equally in all the Saints: whereas this expression of <HI>Pouring</HI> the Spirit intimates a larger commu∣nication of him to some then unto others. Wherefore the Phrase is Metonymical, that being affirmed of the cause, which is proper to the effect. In respect of his effects and operations the Holy Ghost is poured forth upon his Servants.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then by the Spirit here is meant, <HI>The gifts of the Spirit.</HI> All spiritual gifts, especially Illumination in the mysteries of the Gospel is from the Holy Ghost: Hence they that have such gifts are said to be <HI>made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Heb. 6.4. He that hath a gift of knowledge, or a gift of prayer, hath received it from the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit of the Lord is so far poured upon him. And the gifts of the Spirit are compared unto wa∣ter in the Scripture, <HI>Ioh. 7.38, 39. He that believeth on me, out of his belly,</HI> i. e. <HI>his heart, shall flow rivers of living water; this spake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI> For as Waters do refresh the bodies of men, so the gifts of the Holy Ghost do refresh their Souls: when the Lord did showr down his Spirit in that plentiful measure on the Apostles, thou∣sands of Souls were refreshed and revived thereby. This then is partly meant here, when it is said, I will pour my Spirit on your Seed, <HI>h. e.</HI> your Children shall have gifts of the Holy Ghost be∣stowed upon them; they shall be taught to know the Lord from the greatest to the least.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the Spirit here converting, sanctifying Grace is meant: The Spirit is put for the graces thereof: Conversion is the special work of the Holy Ghost: The conversion of the house of <HI>Da∣vid,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000255_0007_0FA4103B6F9CE378"/>
h. e. the Elect of God, is intimated by that of <HI>pouring a Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit of Grace vpon them,</HI> Zech. 12.10. Grace is wrought in the Soul by no other hand then that of the Spirit. When God sends down his Spirit to accompany his Word and Ordinances, then converting work goeth on, but if he withhold the efficacious in∣fluences of his holy Spirit, converting work will be at a stand, all means and outward dispensations notwithstanding. Wherefore <HI>Conversion,</HI> or <HI>Regeneration</HI> is called the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Tit. 3.5. These words then are a promise and gracious intimation unto the Lords People, that a Spirit of Converting grace shall be poured upon their Children.</P>
<P>We come to the second enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> What is implyed in this <HI>Pouring</HI> of the Spirit, which the Text speaketh of?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. This expression doth imply, <HI>that the graces of the Spi∣rit are fitly resembled unto water</HI>; so much is intimated by the Metaphor of <HI>pouring,</HI> which alludeth unto the Clouds, pouring down Rain upon the Earth. Water is of a purifying nature, so the waters of the Spirit, sanctifying grace doth cleanse, and puri∣fie the souls of men, <HI>Ezek. 36.25. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you.</HI> The guilt of sin is washed away in the blood of Christ; the filth of sin is purged by those blessed waters which do proceed from the Spirit of Christ, even converting, sanctifying grace: For the same reason grace is compared unto fire, <HI>Mat. 3.11.</HI> Metals, Gold and Silver, are purified by fire, o∣ther things by water, therefore are the blessed operations of the Holy Ghost compared both to the one, and to the other. Water is of a mollifying nature; the Earth that is dry and hard is thereby softened, <HI>Psal. 65 10. Thou visitest the earth and waterest it,</HI> thou greatly enrichest it with the River of God, which is full of water, <HI>thou makest it soft with showers</HI>: So doth converting grace soften the dry and hard hearts of the children of men; that heart wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was as hard as a stone before, if once a spirit of converting grace be poured thereon; it doth become soft and plyable like water. Again, Water maketh fruitful; showers and floods do so: Thus wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Lord doth rain the waters of the Spirit, or cause them to flow over the Souls of men, they are made f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uitful in the works of Righteousness, <HI>Isai 32.15 Vntil the Spirit he poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field.</HI> That Soul
<PB N="9" REF="000255_0008_0FA4103BB65DA5F8"/>
that was a desolate, parched, barren Wilderness, when once the Spirit from on high is poured upon it, doth become like a fruit∣ful field, <HI>Ezek. 34.26, 27.</HI> Fruits of holiness and righteousness are the effect of being watered by the spirit of God; only the converted man, that hath Grace in his soul, is indeed fruitful, o∣thers are barren and desolate ground. Once more, water is of an healing nature; so are the waters of the spirit, sin is the souls sickness, grace is the souls health; the wound received by origi∣nal Corruption is in some measure healed by converting grace. <HI>Ezek. 47.9. For they shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the River cometh</HI> Those words are a prophesie, concern∣ing the conversion of the Gentiles, by means of that healing ver∣tue which doth attend the blessed waters of the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2. This expressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of pouring the spirit, doth intimate, <HI>an a∣bundant measure of the spirit,</HI> i. e. of the gifts and graces thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Pouring</HI> is something more then <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> as when their com∣eth a plentiful rain from Heaven, enough to satisfie dry Ground▪ it cometh pouring down. As <HI>Elihu</HI> speaks, <HI>Iob 36.27, 28. He maketh small the drops of water, they pour down Rain according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vapour thereof, which the Clouds do drop and distil upon man a∣bundantly.</HI> So this pouring of the spirit noteth a great showr of grace, Hence it is said in the Context, that <HI>Floods</HI> shall be poured on the dry ground, now a <HI>Flood of Grace</HI> intimates a great measure thereof. There are many Scripture expressions that confirm this, <HI>Prov. 1.23. I will pour out my spirit upon you.</HI> The Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Nabang</HI> which is there translated, <HI>Pour,</HI> signifieth to <HI>spring up,</HI> intimating that the spirit of grace in the souls of Believers is like a Fountain, where is an abundance of water. <HI>Isai. 32.15. Vntil the spirit be poured out upon us from on high.</HI> The Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Gnadah</HI> signifieth <HI>to make bare</HI>; so that the meaning is, that there shall be a manifest, conspicuous pouring forth of the spirit, that all the world should take notice of it. And indeed, when a soul is converted there is an abundant effusion of the spirit, to accomplish such a strange thing as that is, to change such a cur∣sed nature, to renew such a vile heart, must needs proceed from a plentiful effusion of the spirit. <HI>Tit. 3▪ 5, 6. By the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour.</HI> Wherefore when it is said, <HI>I will pour my spirit on thy seed, and my blessing on thine
<PB N="10" REF="000255_0009_0FA4103C652D49C8"/>
Off-spring:</HI> the Lord doth graciously promise his servants that their Children shall attain unto an eminency of spiritual gifts, and unto large measures of Grace and Holiness.</P>
<P>We come to the third Enquiry, <HI>viz. How it doth appear that the pouring of the spirit upon Children is a great blessing</HI>? Ans.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that the gift of the Holy Ghost is mentioned in the Scrip∣ture as a great and wonderful thing</HI> It is said, Act. 10.45. <HI>They were astonished, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause that on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Yea, it is mentioned as such a gift as is equi∣valent to all good things, <HI>Mat. 7.11. Your Father which is in Heaven shall give good things to them that ask him</HI>: Now in <HI>Luke</HI> it is expressed by saying, <HI>Your Heavenly Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</HI> Chap 11.13. So then the gift of the Spirit is virtually all good things: Truly if God pour his Spirit upon our Children, he doth more for them then if he bestowed all the good things in the World upon them. This is the great pro∣mise of the Gospel: As the great promise of the Old Testament was concerng the coming of the <HI>Messias,</HI> so the great promise of the New-Testament doth respect a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of Grace. Hence the pouring down of the spirit is noted by that expression of the promise of the Father, <HI>Act. 1.4.</HI> And he is called <HI>the spirit of Promise,</HI> Eph 1.13. as being the great gift which God hath promised to bestow on his servants.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Truth is evident in that the Blessing here spoken of, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an everlasting Blessing.</HI> Eternal good things are the chief: so is this Blessing of the spirit, upon whom he is poured, upon them, and in them he remaineth for evermore: The Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atzak</HI> which is here translated <HI>Pour,</HI> signifieth to <HI>Fasten</HI> as well as to <HI>Pour: I will fasten my spirit upon your Children.</HI> That in∣dwelling of the person of the Holy Ghost in Believers, which the New-Testament speaketh so much of, is everlasting: He abi∣deth with them and in them for ever, <HI>Iohn 14.16.</HI> And the gra∣ces of the spirit, which he doth pour on his People are everlasting: common gifts may cease, but special grace abideth to eternity. It is a seed of God that is incorruptible, which liveth and abideth for ever, <HI>1 Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 23.</HI> As the Holy Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which signified the Ho∣ly Ghost, his coming down from Heaven into the hearts of his People) it never went out; no more shall grace dye, or be total∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>inguished in a Believing soul▪ Hence, true Grace is com∣pared
<PB N="11" REF="000255_0010_0FA4103D32002008"/>
unto living (<HI>i. e.</HI> spring) water, which never runs dry; yea un∣to great Rivers in respect of their perennity: great Rivers are al∣wayes running from the beginning of the World to the end there∣of; so is true saving-grace of an everlasting nature, <HI>Isai. 41.18.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A spirit of Converting Grace is such a Blessing as never goeth alone</HI>: that setteth forth the greatness, and eminency of it: If (saith the Apostle) God give us his Son, shall he not with Him give us all things, <HI>Rom 8.32</HI> So if the Lord give his holy spirit to us, and to our Children, shall he not with him give all things: Godliness hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come, <HI>1 Tim 4.8</HI> We should not trouble our selves about laying up great portions or much of the things of this World for our Children; if we can but prevail with God to pour his spirit on them, to give grace to them, they are sure never to want as long as they live in this World. Is not pardon of sin a rich and glorious blessing, which our poor Children, because they are <HI>our</HI> Off spring stand in need of? Now if the Lord pour a spi∣rit of converting grace on them, their sins shall be forgiven, <HI>Mar. 4.12</HI>: Is not eternal life and glory a great Blessing? the pouring of the spirit on the sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a certain sign and evidence of one that is designed unto eternal li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in Heaven: Therefore the Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e speaketh of <HI>the first fruit of the spirit,</HI> Rom 8.23 And of <HI>the earnest of the spirit,</HI> Eph 1 14 If the Lord give grace to our Children, he will give glory too, yea he will withhold from them no good thing, <HI>Psalm 84.11.</HI></P>
<P>Q 4 <HI>But why hath the Lord promised to do thus for the Children of his servants?</HI></P>
<P>Reas: 1 <HI>From the exceeding riches of the grace of God</HI>: That the Lord most High, who hath an absolute dominion over the works of his hands, should at all deal with man in a Covenant way, or make any promise to him, is from grace; much more that he should deal thus with fallen man: And that he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtend his Covenant, not only to Parents, but to their Children also, that their Off-spring with them are under the wings of the Covenant; and moreover, that he should promise so great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blessing as that of gi∣ving his spirit, and yet more, that his Spirit should be <HI>poured</HI> upon them. We may well cry out, as they did, <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch. 4.7. Grace! grace!</HI> None but a God of infinite grace would have done thus.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>Because the Children of Gods people do many of them
<PB N="12" REF="000255_0011_0FA4103E05D98B18"/>
belong to Election,</HI> As it is expressed in the Context, <HI>Ieshurun whom I have chosen</HI>; That Election of God is mentioned as the ground of this promise in the Text. The Elect of God are the proper Subjects of this promise: The Lord in the Covenant of Grace hath not only promised that whoever doth truly believe and repent shall be saved, but as to the Elect, there is a promise of the first Grace, even that converting grace shall be poured on them, they shall be made to repent and believe. A new heart shall be given to the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> h. e. the Elect, typified by the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> Gal. 6.16. Now God hath seen good to cast the line of Election so, as that it doth (though not wholly, and only, yet) for the most part, run through the loins of godly Parents.

<P>I would direct this <HI>Exhortation,</HI> 1. To Parents. 2. To Chil∣dren.</P>
<P N="1">1. To Parents. Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How needful a thing it is to be much in Prayer on this account▪</HI> Converting grace is of absolute necessity in order to Salvation▪ and that as to the Child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n of godly▪ Parents as well as others: For they <HI>are born in sin,</HI> as <HI>David confesseth,</HI> Psal. 51.5 <HI>I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me</HI>; Yet his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther was a precious, godly Woman; and for ought that doth appear to the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rary, his Father was a good man too: wherefore such Children dying in a natural, unconverted state, are liable un∣to Wrath, and Death, and Curse, and Hell, <HI>Eph. 2.3.

You that are Parents, are you willing that the Children of your own bowels should be miserable throughout the dayes of Eter∣nity? That they should ly burning in a fiery Ocean as long as God shall be God? Yet so it must be, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord in mercy look upon them, so as to <HI>pour down of his Spirit</HI> from on High upon them. Moreover <HI>Prayer</HI> is needful upon this account, in that Conversions are become rare in this age of the World.
<PB N="14" REF="000255_0013_0FA41040644BAFE0"/>
They that have their thoughts exercised in discerning things of this nature, have sad apprehension with reference unto this matter: That the work of Conversion hath been at a great stand in the world: In the last age, in the days of our Fathers, in other parts of the world, scarce a Sermon preached but some evidently con∣verted;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ful∣filling of Scrip∣tures</HI> p. 416</NOTE> yea, sometimes hundreds in a Sermon: which of us can say we have seen the like? Clear sound conversions are not fre∣quent in some Congregations. The body of the Rising Genera∣tion is a poor perishing, unconverted, and (except the Lord pour down his Spirit) an undone Generation. Many that are profane, Drunkards, Swearers, Lascivious, Scoffers at the power of God∣liness, Despisers of those that are good, Proud, Disobedient crea∣tures, God from Heaven pity them! Others that are only civil, and outwardly conformed to good order, by reason of their Edu∣cation, but never knew what the new birth means; pray for them that they may not only come near, but enter into the Kingdome of God.</P>
<P>Consider 2. <HI>That Prayer is a notable means to obtain this mercy</HI>; Prayer opens the Windows of Heaven: <HI>Elias</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayed that it might rain, and Heaven gave showrs; Prayer brings down the showers of blessing in a proper literal sence: but especially these spiritual showrs, which the Text speaketh of, wherein the Lord promiseth to showr down his spirit upon our poor Children. Assuredly, if there be Prayers, and Tears before the Lord on this ac∣count, they will come pouring down again in showrs of grace at last. I have read of an eminent Minister of Christ, that having prayed fervently with some Christian Friends, they in the next room felt strange Elapses of the spirit upon the heart, so as that one said, O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that can knock down the spirit of God into all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>? who knoweth but that we may pray down the spirit of God into the souls of our Children, <HI>Luke 11.9.

Luk. 24.49.</HI> And what were they to do at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> in the mean time? No question but (as some have noted) they were much in Fasting and Prayer that this promise of the Father might come upon them. And not long after there was a most gracious and glorious effusion of the spirit. And of later times, God hath been entreated to send down his Spirit abundantly for the conver∣sion of souls. Not fifty years ago, in a place in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a great number of praying Christians met together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem, codem libro</HI> p▪ 417.</NOTE> when a Sermon was to be Preached the next day, and they spent the night afore in Prayer, that the Lord would own the word then to be spoken, for the Conversion of souls, and Behold! the Lord went forth with his word, so as that near upon five hundred Souls were wrought upon, and converted by that one Sermon. I have been told of a Church in <HI>New England,</HI> that set apart a day for this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At Mil∣ford</HI></NOTE> that they might by Fasting and Prayer beg converting Grace for their Children, and that since, the Gospel hath been made successful in that Congregation, so as that a day of publick Thanksgiving hath been attended, in that so many of the youn∣ger; Rising Generation have been brought home to Christ. Now if the Lord awaken a Spirit of Prayer concerning this thing in these Churches generally, there will doubtless be some blessed ef∣fect of it, with respect to the Rising Generation. And whereas God hath put it into our hearts to set apart this day, thus to seek unto him, I am perswaded it shall not be in vain, but that there are a number of souls belonging to this Congregation, that must have the spirit of the Lord pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed on them: Sheep that are not yet brought into the Lords Fold, that must hear the voice of the Son of God and live: Since the time that we agreed thus to set apart this day, God hath sent down plentiful showrs, whereby the dry and thirsty Ground is wonderfully Refreshed: And is not that a token for good, that those blessed showers which we are Fasting and Praying for this day, shall in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e time come down upon the Souls of our poor Children?</P>
<P>Consider 3. <HI>What encouragement we have to be at this work.</HI> The success which such Prayers have had (of which something hath been mentioned, and much more might be spok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n) should encourage us. As for some of us, our Fathers and Mothers now in glory, did pray for us when they were in the World, and God heard them, did they that we are sprung from, pray for us? and
<PB N="16" REF="000255_0015_0FA4104261807A20"/>
hath God heard them? and will he not hear us if we go and pray in like manner for our Off-spring? And have we not already seen some Answers? If we look into our Families, do we not discern that as to some of our Children, the fear of God is put into their hearts? And why should we not look upon that as a first fruits, that all the rest of our Children shall be converted in due time? Moreover, the consideration of the Covenant, and Promises of God respecting Children, are a great encouragement to pray for them. This is his everlasting Covenant, <HI>I will be a God to thee and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy seed after thee,</HI> Gen. 17.7. This promise is expressed in∣definitely, and therefore doth encourage godly Parents to plead with the Lord for mercy and grace for all their Children: As an Holy man once said, and it was a great word of Faith in him, <HI>If I had twenty Children I would not bate God one of them.</HI> He hath promised to be a God to my children indefinitely,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr Winter of Infant Baptism p. 105, 107</HI></NOTE> and therefore I'le pray for them all, and believe for them all, and why should it not be so, since the Lord himself hath said, ALL <HI>thy Chil∣dren shall be taught of God,</HI> Isai. 54.13. And the Scripture doth a∣bound with particular promises, respecting the Conversion and Salvation of the Children of godly Parents: When thou dost that which is good, and right in the sight of God, <HI>it shall go well with thy Children after thee for ever,</HI> Deut. 12 28 There is spe∣cial mercy belonging to those that are the Seed of the blessed of the Lord, and to their Off-spring with them, <HI>Isai. 65.23.</HI> yea pro∣mises of converting Grace to be poured upon them, <HI>Zech. 10.9. They shall live with their Children, and turn again.</HI> The Chil∣dren of the Lords People shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned from the power of Satan unto God; that's implied in those words, and not only that the Jews and their Children should be returned from their Captivity in Babylon, whereby this turning again from sin unto God, <HI>h e.</HI> that Conversion which we are speaking of was mysteriously signi∣fied as in a Type. And in the Book of <HI>Psalms,</HI> we find gracious promises to the Children of such as fear God, <HI>Psal. 102.28. The Children of thy Servants shall continue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vid <HI>Mr Stockton of fami∣ly instru¦ction.</HI> p 118.</NOTE> <HI>and their Seed shall be esta∣blished before thee.</HI> And again <HI>Psal. 128 3.

And in special, there is a promise of this blessing with
<PB N="17" REF="000255_0016_0FA4104271E81F80"/>
respect to Children in the times of the Gospel: <HI>Ioel 2.28. It shall come to pass afterwards,</HI> h. e. <HI>in the last dayes, or times of the Gospel,</HI> as the Apostle doth expound the words, I <HI>will pour my Spirit upon your Children.</HI> Now these days wherein we live, come under the last days, we therefore should plead that promise before the Lord, and say, These are the last days, Lord, and thou hast said, that in the last dayes thou wilt pour thy Spirit upon the Chil∣dren of thy Servants. And indeed that fulfilling of the promise which our eys have seen is ground of encouragement to pray and plead, and believe for more. Some of <HI>New England</HI> Children have been eminently blessed by the Lord; he hath poured his spi∣rit upon them richly, <HI>Plants of Renown</HI> have sprung up here, that have been the glory of the Land where they have had their Edu∣cation: yea, some, that whole Nations have fared the better for them: Rivers of Water have flow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out of their Souls, whereby thousands have been refreshed. And there is a blessed sprinkling in most Churches; though not that general pouring down of the Spirit that is to be desired, yet a sprinkling which we should take notice of, for the encouragement of Faith and Prayer. I shall only mention that which I have most reason to know; in this poor Congregation, within these few late years, there have been of Children born in <HI>New-England,</HI> near upon fourscore persons, that have come before the Church, and declared what God hath done for their souls, and in that way subscribed their names to the God of <HI>Israel</HI>; besides many that have come out of other Lands, and when they have been here, the Lord hath poured his Spirit upon them. I speak it that God may have the glory of his grace, and that Ministers may be encouraged to Preach, and the Lords People to pray for the conversion of souls. Moreover, the considera∣tion of what Parents the children of this Land are (many of them) sprung from, doth afford matter of encou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agement <HI>Pau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was in∣duced the rather to hope well concerning <HI>Timothy,</HI> because he was descended of such a stock, he had a gracious Mother, and a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣cious Grandmother also, <HI>2 Tim. 1.5.</HI> So many Children with us are the Off spring of such Parents, <HI>(Fathers</HI> and <HI>Grand-fathers)</HI> as have been eminent for God in their time, eminent for holi∣ness, yea and for sufferings, on the accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing witness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Name and Truth of Christ Now a special <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing is wont to follow the Children of such as have been su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erers for C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist▪

Hath not the Lord peculiar bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssings in store for such Children▪ let us pray them down from Heaven above.</P>
<P>Consider 4. <HI>What a blessed thing it will be, if we prevail in Hea∣ven for this mercy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Read</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Hooker Sermon on Hos. 10.12</HI></NOTE> We cannot pray for a more desirable thing then this blessing!

If the Lord pour his Spirit on the body of the present rising Generation, so as to begin a work of Conversion in those that are as yet stran∣gers to the power of godliness, and to carry on that work by re∣newed Conversions in the hearts of his People, that will save us from those Judgements which otherwise there is no hope that we shall escape them. <HI>Ezek. 39.29.

<PB N="19" REF="000255_0018_0FA41044D1259278"/>
We shall meet those Prayers again with exceeding joy <HI>in that day.</HI> And in the mean time, our Children, if we can pray down the Spirit of the Lord upon them, will continue to pray for us, whilst we are with them in the World. O what a blessed thing is that, for a man to have the Children that came out of his own bowels, praying for him continually? A worthy Minister of Christ once said, <HI>I had rather have my house filled with my Childrens Prayers, then to have my house filled with Gold.</HI></P>
<P>A few things by way of Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let Parents b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that they be converted themselves,</HI> Deut. 30.6. <HI>I will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy Seed.</HI> If our own hearts be circumcised, we may pray in Faith that the Lord will circumcise the hearts of our Children, otherwise we cannot do it. Parents that have not grace themselves are not fit to pray fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace to be poured on their Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dren; nor indeed can they do it: for the spirit of supplication is the Spirit of grace, <HI>Zech. 12 10.</HI> Nor can they believe for them. An Hypocrite, or unconverted man cannot act Faith for his Childs soul, who never yet did believe for his own Soul. Nor doth this promise in the Text belong to other Parents, <HI>Psal 128.4. Behold that thus shall the man be bless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that feareth the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Parents, be exemplary.</HI> Walk before God in your Houses with a perfect heart. Let us be careful in our Families, to walk so that our Children may see by our examples how they ought to walk and to please God, that if they will but be and do like unto their Parents, they shall certainly be blessed for ever. There are many of the Elect of God, that the special means of their con∣version hath been the holy example of their Parents. Many a chosen Vessel, that when he hath beheld his Fathers love to Christ, and faithfulness to the interest of God, Zeal, Patience, Holiness, that hath been a special means of Conviction and Conversion. You know what <HI>Elijah</HI> said to <HI>Elisha,</HI> when he desired that he might have (<HI>h. e.</HI> comparatively to what the rest of the Sons of the Prophets had) a double portion of <HI>Elijah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Spirit, He said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Se my Brother sermon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1 Kin 8.57.</HI> p 22</NOTE> <HI>Thou hast ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d an hard thing, nevertheless if thou see me when I am ta∣ken from thee, it shall be so unto thee, but if not, it shall not be so,</HI> 2 Kin. 2.10.

<PB N="20" REF="000255_0019_0FA4104627E1A010"/>
As on the other hand there is nothing more fatally destructive and ruining to the Souls of Children then a bad example in Parents, especially if they be such as pretend to Religion: when <HI>Cham</HI> did but one time see his Father in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink, it brought a fearful curse upon him, and upon his Posterity to this day. There are great com∣plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s (and too great cause) concerning <HI>the Rising Generation in New-England</HI>; whereas the fault is very much in Parents, in that they are no more exemplary: Your Children take notice of your Pride, your Sensuality, your Worldliness, your unmortified pas∣sions, and that doth wofully scandalize, and harden them against the blessed ways of Christ. O be careful to walk so as that your Children may not see their Fathers nakedness.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let Parents be careful to instruct their Children in the fear of God</HI>: Prayer should be followed with suitable endeavors. If Parents must pray that their Children may have Grace, they must use the means whereby God is wont to convey Grace into the Souls of his Elect. <HI>Psal.</HI> 34 11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken un∣to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> David did so, and <HI>So∣lomon</HI> his Son found that those Paternal Instructions were blessed for saving good to his Soul, <HI>Prov</HI> 4.<HI>1.3, 4.</HI> Also the Instructions of his Mother were (through the blessing of God) a means of much good unto him, <HI>Prov. 31.1, 2.</HI> Fathers and Mothers sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be instilling good Principles into the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and hearts of their Children betimes. <HI>Ephes. 6.4.

Efficacy. When your Bodies are in the Grave, and your Souls in Heaven, your Children may remember how you instructed them, and prayed for them, and the remembrance of it may then be a means of their conversion: You may hear of your Childrens con∣version after you are in Heaven; the Angels of God that see it, and that rejoyce over a sinner that repenteth will bring you the tidings of it; and then there will be joy all Heaven over.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me exhort Children that are here before the Lord this day: <HI>O do you go home, and pray earnestly for converting Grace.</HI> Beg as for your lives that the God of your Fathers would pour his Spirit upon you: Young ones hearken! In the Name of the Lord I speak to you; the Lord can pour his Spirit on you betimes, then shall you be rich in Grace, let this promise encourage you to look up to God through Jesus Christ. Go into secret corners, and plead it with God; say, Lord thou hast promised to pour thy Spirit upon the Off-spring of thy Servants; I am (through thy grace) among the Children of thy Servants; thou art the God of my Father, the God of my Grand-father, oh! be my God also. If you seek God in earnest, he will be found of you, but if you forsake him, and break his Covenant sealed in your Baptisme, wo unto you. If you dy and be not first new Creatures, better you had never been born: you will be left without excuse before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, terrible witnesses shall rise up against you at the last day. Your godly Parents will testifie against you before the Son of God at that day: And the Ministers of Christ will also be called in as witnesses against you for your condemnation, if you dy in your sins. As for many of you, <HI>I</HI> have treated with you privately and personally, I have told you, and I do tell you, and make solemn Protestation before the Lord, that if you dy in a Christless, grace∣less estate, I will must certainly profess unto Jesus Christ at the day of Judgement, Lord, these are the Children, whom I spake often unto in thy Name, publickly and privately, and <HI>I</HI> told them, that if they did not make to themselves a new heart, and make sure of an interest in Christ, they should become damned creatures for evermore; and yet they would not repent and believe the Gospel. O why should <HI>I</HI> that can appeal to God, that I long for your Conversion, be your accuser before the Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus at the last day?</P>
<P>And you that are grown up to years of more discretion, and un∣derstanding:

Young Men, and young Women, O be in earnest for Converting Grace, before it be too late. It is high time for you to look about you, deceive not your selves with false Conver∣sions (as many young men do to their eternal ruine) or with gifts instead of Grace; beware of out-standing your day of Grace, lest the Spirit of God depart, and your Souls become desolate. Death waits for you. There is now a Mortal and Contagious Disease in many Houses; the Sword of the Lord is drawn, and young men fall down apace slain under it; do you not see the Ar∣rows of Death come flying over your heads? Why then, Awake, Awake, and turn to God in Jesus Christ whilst it is called to day, and know for certain that if you dy in your sins, you will be the most miserable of any poor Creatures in the bottom of Hell. Oh consider of it, to be prayed, wept, Preached, Fasted down to Hell, what an amazing thing will it be! wherefore now hear, and turn, and live; As yet Christ stands and knocks at the door of your hearts· He doth so this day, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Sermon.
