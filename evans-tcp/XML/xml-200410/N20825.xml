<LG>
<L>WHEN fam'd Columbus nobly dar'd to brave,</L>
<L>The untry'd perils of the Western wave;</L>
<L>Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,</L>
<L>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</L>
<L>The rude companions of his bold design,</L>
<L>Fatigu'd with toil, against their chief combine:</L>
<L>When sudden—bursting on th' astonish'd view!</L>
<L>A world discover'd prov'd his judgment true.—</L>
<L>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</L>
<L>"Pursu'd Columbus with envenom'd hate;</L>
<L>"But minds like his a base degen'rate race,</L>
<L>"Might meanly persecute—but not disgrace:</L>
<L>"The noble soul its energy maintains,</L>
<L>"In spite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sons of Europe found a guileless race,</L>
<L>No fraud was veil'd beneath the smiling face;</L>
<L>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</L>
<L>Pourtray'd the cloudless sunshine of the mind:</L>
<L>Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</L>
<L>Whose pow'r reliev'd, but ne'er inflicted pain,</L>
<L>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</L>
<L>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</L>
<L>One custom with their virtues ill agreed,</L>
<L>Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;</L>
<L>Compell'd at Superstition's shrine to bow,</L>
<L>The hapless victims of a cruel vow!</L>
<L>Their sweetest maids were often doom'd to prove,</L>
<L>No joy in friendship, and no bliss in love!</L>
<L>Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,</L>
<L>The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;</L>
<L>For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,</L>
<L>Love sits triumphant on the heart—his throne!</L>
<L>And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,</L>
<L>To aggravate the sense of human woes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="027352_0004_0FD420DDDCE42DE0"/>
<L>The rigid laws of time, and place, our bard,</L>
<L>In this night's drama, ventures to discard:</L>
<L>If here he errs—he errs with <HI>him</HI> whose name,</L>
<L>Stands without rival on the rolls of Fame;</L>
<L><HI>Him</HI> whom the passions own with one accord,</L>
<L>Their Great Dictator, and despotic Lord!</L>
<L>Who plac'd aloft on Inspiration's throne,</L>
<L>Made Fancy's magic kingdom all his own,</L>
<L>Burst from the trammels which his muse confin'd,</L>
<L>And pour'd the wealth of his exhaustless mind!</L>
<L>Though SHAKSPEARE'S flight no mortal shall pursue—</L>
<L>COLUMBUS' story patroniz'd by you,</L>
<L>Will yield an off'ring, grateful to his dust—</L>
<L>A British laurel on a hero's bust!</L>

<HEAD>COLUMBUS: AN HISTORICAL PLAY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I.—On one side of the stage a flight of steps, with a Portico leading to the Temple of the Sun.—In the back∣ground the sea. Time, sun-rise.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Catalpo <HI>and Priests from the Temple, who range them∣selves—then enter</HI> Orozimbo—<HI>they how to him as he passes.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>OROZIMBO, <HI>prostrating himself to the sun.</HI></STAGE>
<P>SOUL of the universe, who from thy glittering throne beamest immortal splendour, as thou hast permit∣ed the stars for their appointed hour to bespangle the veil of night, now o'erwhelm all manner of glories in the greatness of thy effulgence, and be once more welcom'd by thy devoted servants to delight and bless the world!—Catalpo, conduct hither the virgin destin∣ed to receive a priestess' sacred office.</P>
<STAGE>CATALPO <HI>exit, and re-enters with</HI> SOLASCO, <HI>leading in</HI> CORA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solasco</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(kneels.)</STAGE>
<P>Mighty chief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="027352_0006_0FD420E1C712E9C0"/>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, good Solasco.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solasco.</SPEAKER>
<P>I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god. It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the comforts of her dear society—but the bright sun, our glorious deity, demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do <HI>him</HI> honour.—Pardon, my king, an old man's tears; but na∣ture will not always, without a struggle, yield to duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast, indeed, devoted to thy god a precious treasure; but tell me, Cora, can thy youth∣ful mind freely resign the livelier joys of social life, and rest contented in seclusion and tranquillity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts, from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedi∣ence:—Should he doom my death, his mandate would be met with equal resignation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy pious mind, which knows to yield such duty to a father, will well befit the service of thy god.—But hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty.—Should the heart, to heaven devoted, become the prey of sacrilegious love, our law consigns it priestess, and the accomplice of her guilt, to instant death. Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith, and should her flight elude offended justice, their forfeit lives must expiate her erime. <STAGE>[Cora <HI>bows to the sun</HI>]</STAGE> Now to the altar, and record your vows; then, as our custom is, come forth to shine Queen of this festive day, the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exeunt</HI> Cora, Solasco, <HI>and</HI> Priests, <HI>to the Temple.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>[During the latter part of this scene the sun becomes ob∣scured by clouds, and thunder and lightning issue from them—the sea much agitated.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catalpo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great chief, behold what envious clouds obscure the glories of our god.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, Catalpo, what mean these bodings! <STAGE>[A ship appears from behind a projecting rock.]</STAGE> And lo!—What monster's that, whose wings bear it buoy∣ant one the watery main?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="3" REF="027352_0007_0FD420E349852A10"/>
[<HI>A cannon is discharged from the ship.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catalpo.</SPEAKER>
<P>See!—From its throat thunder and fire burst forth, seeming to brave high heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not dismay'd—summon our warriors. <STAGE>[<HI>to</HI> Cuto.]</STAGE> Catalpo, let the priests attend.</P>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II. The Country.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Orozimbo, <HI>meeting</HI> Cuto, <HI>Warriors, and In∣dians.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>My people, we'll to the shore—Should they prove mortal foes, we'll meet their thunders, or if the engines of infernal power, what can virtue fear?—Trust me, the Deity we serve, will re-assume his splen∣dour, and protect his chosen people.</P>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>
</SP>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE III. A View of an Indian Country.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter in procession, Indian officer—Warriors—Indian Music—Cuto—Archers—Standard of the Sun—Cora—Priests of the Sun—Indians bearing presents and Ban∣ners—Nelti—Indian Women bearing Presents—Warriors—Orozimbo in a Car, burnished with Gold, supported on the shoulders of Indians, and attended by Nobles with golden Staves—Warriors.</STAGE>

<HEAD>SCENE IV. The Sea Coast.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Three ships are seen at anchor, and Boats come to shore with Martial <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Colours flying.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter from the Boat,</HI> Columbus, Alonzo, Roldan, Valverdo, Harry Herbert, <HI>and the rest of the Spanish Adventurers.</HI>—Columbus <HI>lands first, with his Sword drawn—he falls and embraces the Earth, during which Time there are three Cheers, and a discharge of Artil∣lery; then the rest follow and come forward.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, to high Heaven, who thus, with never fading honour, hath crown'd its poorest servant,
<PB N="4" REF="027352_0008_0FD420E4D8754AA0"/>
let me pour forth a heart o'erwelm'd with gratitude. And now begin the important work which heaven has delegated to us—Erect the sacred banner of our faith.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[The Cross is erected on one side of the stage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brave associates! join with me in praise of him, who hath atchiev'd what ignorance, with sapient shrug, and satisfied, benumbing prudence, derided as the chimera of a madman's fancy: falling at his feet, let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence.</P>
<STAGE>[They all kneel.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, rise;—rather, my Alonzo, in these arms receive my thanks, thou, next to heaven, my firmest friend. Ye men of Spain, let what has passed admonish you in what may be to come—keep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world; how you beat your breasts, oppressed with fear and superstition—How, with wo∣manish tears, you bade adieu to life, and blubbered out a requiem for your souls; then embracing desperation instead of fortitude, I was to be your sacrifice; and this body, which has been your conductor to wealth and ho∣nour, you would have given to the sea, and ignorance and cowardice would have triumphed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valverdo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty Sir, forgive us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Freely, good Valverdo—Let the man stand forth, who, at a time so fraught with peril, first discovered land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Coming forward.]</STAGE>
<P>It was my good for∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art not a Spaniard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, your Excellency, I am an English∣man; and tho' we Englishmen, are an odd, whimsi∣cal set of fellows, yet we generally contrive (and I trust ever shall) to keep a good look out a-head when our superior is in danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me your fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is Harry Herbert; I am de∣scended from as respectable and independant an ances∣tor as the world can boast,—an English yeoman; but the civil wars leaving my family little, which my im∣prudence soon made less, I thought that, altho' King
<PB N="5" REF="027352_0009_0FD420E643571A40"/>
Henry was deprived of the honour of this enterprize, that did not preclude his subjects; so I shipped myself off for Castille, where I had just time and cast enough to fall a dozen times in love, and into other scrapes, before I had the honour of embarking on board your Excellency's squadron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herbert, thou dost honour to thy country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, I am glad, that for once I am even with it; for I am sure my country does honour to me.</P>
<STAGE>[Indian music without.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roldan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold a crowd of people, many of whom seem clad in the sacred vestments—Their dress and standards bespeak them greatly civilized, and full of wealth.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter in procession Indian Warriors, bearing a Standard of the Sun</HI>—Orozimbo, Cora, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Descends from his Car.]</STAGE>
<P>Strangers, who seem to be above the race of mortals, instruct us how to honour you—If you be the children of the Sun, be∣hold our priests, who with persumes and libations, will welcome you to his holy temple; or, if human, here are fruits to feed you, dwellings to shelter you, and garments to clothe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chief, you behold in us the children of mortality; but the power we serve, in his high mer∣cy, has bestowed upon us superior gifts; thus, thro' unknown seas to brave the imperious surge, and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earth—But that Deity commands us to proclaim his name with peace—The King, our master, wishes to enrich thee and himself—This hardy metal, useful in all the purposes of life, he will exchange for those thy country may produce.</P>
<STAGE>[Presents a hatchet.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very strange—Thy King much wrongs himself—all we have to render is our gold, but that we find so yielding, and so useless, it were injury to offer it—Indulge the curiosity of a stranger.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Orozimbo, <HI>with</HI> Columbus, Roldan, Herbert, Nelti, Catalpo, <HI>&amp;c. move up the stage.</HI>]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a tender glance escap'd my eye, im∣pelled
<PB N="6" REF="027352_0010_0FD420E8D9AAC14"/>
by Beauty's power, and from my bosom the soft sigh instinctively has stolen—Many a fair Castili∣an has enforced the test of admiration, but now my every sense seems drawn by power magnetic to that lovely saint—Permit me, fairest creature, to express my admiration at the charms which now present them∣selves—tho' all the wonders of a new discovered world display their rival novelties, yet, now that I behold its first of wonders, all else exacts from me as little no∣tice, as I, I fear have power to merit to command from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stranger, you wrong yourself, and hold me unskilful to distinguish, when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticed—Your praises of the hum∣ble Cora, tho' they have caused no vain emotion, yet ever will the mind receive with pleasure, praise e'en unmerited, when 'tis bestowed by those who claim our admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colours of ideal excellence, can never reach that exquisite perfection nature exhibits—how must I bless my happy fortune, that bore me to a clime which boasts an ornament like thee!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>What new emotion rises in my breast—I fear to ask my heart from whence it springs. Oh, Cora! think of thy sacred duty—think of the vow which passed thy lips so lately.—Stranger, tho' sacred hospitality commanded me to pay this courtesy, yet now a higher duty enjoins me to desist from further converse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me entreat one instant—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must not be—my conduct is controuled by rigid laws. Farewell.—Oh Cora, what days of wretch∣edness art thou doomed to suffer!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Aside, as she retires to the priests.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What cou'd she mean? "Her conduct is controuled by rigid laws."—If she be destined to ano∣ther, my lot is misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[<HI>with</HI> Columbus, <HI>coming forward</HI>]</STAGE>
<P>In harmony and peace I rule a free and happy people, and
<PB N="7" REF="027352_0011_0FD420EA609FF1A8"/>
I were worthy of my kingdom, did I not endeavour to the utmost to convert the name of stranger into friend.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all the day long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you no monks who pray for you, dispute with you, and burn you alive when you don't think as they do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor devils, what a way they must be in!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you come from the other world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you see something angelic about me, eh!—Yes, my love, I come from a little paradise, call'd England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is England a world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bit of one; but, little as it is, it some∣how contrives to manage all the rest.—Shou'd you like to live in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes; I suppose English women, arm'd with spears made of that pretty, hard iron, climb the mountains, and destroy the wild bull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destroy the wild bull! No, my dear; our English women find prettier amusement in encoura∣ging the breed of horned cattle—the use of the pretty, hard iron is confined to the men, and no great favourite either; for I know many flourishers of spontoons, who have a cursed antipathy to cold iron—Who is that elegant creature you were conversing with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her name is Cora; she was this day admit∣ted a priestess of the Sun.—The handsomest virgins are always selected to sustain that sacred office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>The handsomest! you were then, on that account, not——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I say the handsomest? Oh dear, I mean
<PB N="8" REF="027352_0012_0FD420EE8AE1EB50"/>
they select the most sedate—for, from this day she must never leave the temple, or converse with any ex∣cept the priests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except the priests! Go where you will, you find those gentlemen always contrive to be well ta∣ken care of—would you like to become a priestess?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[sighing.]</STAGE>
<P>Last night perhaps I should.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming sensibility! and may I, my sweet girl, interpret that sigh in my favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you will not love me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not love thee!—By Magna Charta, I'll resign my life, fortune, and liberty to thee,—besides, I'll bring thee beads, cloaths, music—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, that is not love.—They only try to please the eye, who find their actions cannot touch the heart—no presents or toys could influence Nelti—no, not if you were to give her an iron javelin and a tame tiger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—very delicate presents for a young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
<P>I wish I cou'd make him love me—how do women in England gain their lover's hearts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generally by using them like dogs—for, when a woman studiously avoids looking at a man, abuses him on all occasions, and is kind to every one else, we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
<P>I never can find in my heart to use him ill—What ugly thing is that?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Dolores <HI>and</HI> Bribon, <HI>from a boat.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A doctor of physic, who having killed all his patients in the old world, except his wife, who wou'd never take his medicines, has ventured hither, in pursuit of new patients, new fees, and perhaps a new bed-fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lawyer and a coxcomb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's a coxcomb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A reptile, my dear, that is found in abun∣dance

<P>To be sure—consider the importance of my life to you all; but my chief reason was, that the famous astrologer, Doctor Diego Diablasco, told me something ill would happen if I were rash—but there seems no danger—that's a very pretty girl, and I love a fine young girl, almost as much as I do fine old gold.</P>

When our gracious Queen em∣braced the fortunes of this foreign Viceroy, and even proffered her regal ornaments to equip his fleet, the minister, Fonseca, jealous of the same that might at∣tend this enterprize, worked on the scars of the suspi∣cious Ferdinand, to execute this commission of control, which, new Columbus' conduct gives pretence, arrays me with the power of crushing his authority, and with disgrace returning him to Spain.</P>

<P>I, who am doomed to view the dearest ob∣ject of my doating fondness, whose fondness oft' has steeped these aged eyes in tears of joy, to see her brand∣ed with guilt, devoted to destruction.—Have not I full cause, thus loudly to complain, and to upbraid thee,—I, her hapless father?——</P>

<P>If thou dost truly love my hapless child, e'en in the midst of all my woes, my bosom owns one pang for thee—The torments of my Cora soon must end.—Thine, alas!—but let me not encrease the sor∣rows I could wish to soothe——Farewell——obey my dying child, and grant her all the joy she now can taste—to know that thou art safe.</P>

<P>That was indeed a triumph.—See those wretches closely guarded—their punishment must not now damp the joy I feel. Oh, were I satisfied no fu∣ture Roldans would alarm your peace, I should be blest indeed.—Had I earlier known that England's monarch

<L>OLD stories done—old times long since forgotten,</L>
<L>Like musty records, little read, and rotten,</L>
<L>Return we now, to periods sounder grown,</L>
<L>To happier days, and readings of our own;</L>
<L>Where'er we ope the book, the style is clear,</L>
<L>The int'rest charming, the conclusions, dear;</L>
<L>Our means are flourishing, our joys not scant,</L>
<L>Possess'd of every good, the heart can want,</L>
<L>Old tales of conquest, thrown on distant shelves,</L>
<L>We've little left to conquer—but ourselves:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An arduous task—and yet to do us right,</L>
<L>We lose no time in ent'ring on the fight;</L>
<L>Miss, scarcely in her teens, attacks Mama,</L>
<L>Already having routed <HI>sage</HI> Papa;</L>
<L>"I'm not a chit—I <HI>will</HI> turn up my looks,—</L>
<L>"I <HI>will</HI> wear powder, and I <HI>won't</HI> wear frocks?—</L>
<L>"I hate to dance with <HI>boys,</HI> now I'm so tall,</L>
<L>"I'm fit for <HI>any man</HI> at <HI>any ball;</HI>—</L>
<L>"You want to keep me back, because it's known,</L>
<L>"When girls <HI>grow up,</HI> their mothers, they <HI>grow down.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>Pert Master Bobby too, releas'd from school,</L>
<L>Hectors at home, and early learns to rule;</L>
<L>The splendid stud, relinquish'd by his sire</L>
<L>In grand display, awaits the youthful Squire;</L>
<L>And while to Cambridge he should <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> steer,</L>
<L>Newmarket's course arrests his gay career;</L>
<L>There he <HI>long odds, short betts, pass dice,</HI> all pat in,</L>
<L><PB REF="027352_0058_0FD4214DED6DAB50"/>
Sticks to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and disregards the Latin;</L>
<L>Flown up to town, our fierce-cock'd, <HI>captious</HI> Bobby,</L>
<L>Drives to the play, and quarrels in the lobby;</L>
<L>"Sir, you're a scoundrel! damme Sir, you lie"—</L>
<L>"Sir, here's my <HI>card,</HI> for <HI>damme I am—I."</HI>—</L>
<L>Thus is the boy, intent to ape the man,</L>
<L>A puff of discord, and a flash in pan.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In married life, resolving each to drive,</L>
<L>A sweet contention keeps the flame alive;</L>
<L>"I know my province—so do I, my Lady—</L>
<L>"You'll prove my torment—you've proved mine al∣ready.</L>
<L>"To guard my rights, my Lord, I must endeavour—</L>
<L>"You're always out—and you are out for ever—</L>
<L>"Then both I trust are happy, <HI>sposo caro— <STAGE>(with iron∣ical tenderness)</STAGE></HI></L>
<L>"You throw at <HI>hazard,</HI> and I punt at <HI>pharo;</HI></L>
<L>"Each have their object—so resentment smother—</L>
<L>"Hold out the olive <HI>branch,</HI> or wear another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suffice this railler,—enough to prove,</L>
<L>Our noblest conquest, is our own self-love;</L>
<L>The Author, who to-night has greatly dar'd,</L>
<L>To brave the issue of your high award;</L>
<L>Tho' old the legend whence his scenes he drew,</L>
<L>Humbly presumes, the inference may be new;</L>
<L>Should then the efforts of his untaught muse,</L>
<L>By just, tho' small desert, his flights excuse;</L>
<L>Let him enjoy, for all his anxious toils,</L>
<L>That bright reward—the triumph of your smiles.</L>
