<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> may not be amiss in the first place to mention a little of the Character of the Rev. Mr. Ma∣son, as given us by a person intimately acquainted with him.
"My ac∣quaintance (saith he) with Mr. Mason I have esteemed one of the grea∣test mercies I ever Received. His Learning and piety were great, and his humility deep. His affections were so fervent, and his zeal so great, that as they were the comfort so they were the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mirat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of those that feared God, and lived near him. So great was his love to Christ, that he had a value for any one who spoke a Savory word of him. And as he had a great charity for others, so he was most highly esteemed by the different de∣nominations of Christi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns. The frame of his spirit was so heavenly▪ his de∣portment
<PB N="iv" REF="034061_0003_0FFA71FF2C776C40"/>
so humble and obliging, his discourse of spiritual things (and lit∣tle else could we hear from him) so weighty, with such apt words and delightful air that it charmed all that had any spiritual Relish, and at the same time was not so burdensome to others, as discourses of that nature have been from other writers."</P>
<P>What a happy time would the Church of God experience, if all its members stood in the same place with this truly pious Christian. Instead of contending about forms and specula∣tions, we could all unite in the humble charitable, and pious temper with which this good man was so eminently distinguished. The pravalence of such a spirit and temper, is more to be wished for, by every good Christian, than any of those things about which we gene∣rally spend our warmest zeal. If we are Zealous, let us (as he did) turn the heat of our zeal against sin,
<PB N="v" REF="034061_0004_0FFA720109FCABD0"/>
and for the necessary and undesputed interest of vital holiness, and then it will not be so apt to blind and mislead us. If we cannot all be of the same sentiments let us be all of, and influ∣enced by one spirit—But this is a hap∣piness rather to be desired than expect∣ed, till some Divine power, more gen∣erally correct our tempers, and give the human mind a better disposition; or till God shall tune the heart of every Christian to the harmony of his own Divine feelings—O! when shall we cease to strive about the chaff while we neglect the wheat; when shall we cease to build with hay, wood and stubble, which God will destroy by the bright∣ness of his coming?</P>
<P>But to return. The Author of these remains had an excellent▪talent in the sententious way; he loved to deliver a thought in as few and expressive words as might be, as appears from these his religious maxims and
<PB N="vi" REF="034061_0005_0FFA7203C1B0BD40"/>
sentences, the reader is here presented with; many of them are easy and na∣tural, most of them strong and beauti∣ful, and all of them devout and spiri∣tual.</P>
<P>If such kind of religious sayings as those of Mr Mason, were but as fa∣miliar to us as our common proverbs; and if parents would but take the pains to insinuate them into, and fix them in the tender minds of their children, I am satisfied it would answer a very valuable purpose in the religious life.</P>
<P>The serious advice to youth, as it is a plain and affectionate persuasive and directory to the religious conduct, I hope it may be of service, not only to those to whom it is immediately ad∣dress'd, but to all who sincerely desire to maintain a conscientious walk with God.</P>
<P>The directions and signs, &amp;c. may be useful to doubting and discourag'd christians; and to all who make con∣science
<PB N="vii" REF="034061_0006_0FFA7206F72EC138"/>
of the great duty of self-exam∣ination, and desire to know the true habit and state of their souls.</P>
<P>Mr. Mason was very happy in his epistolary stile and talents; and if the common maxim may be credited, that a man's true turn and genius may best be known by his letters; these which are here inserted will abundantly con∣firm the character I have given of this excellent man, in most of which we meet with the same genuine zeal, and unaffected fervour, which animates the rest of these select remains.</P>
<P>The devout christian loves to be an∣imated and impressed with a strong sense of divine things. And in most of these devotional maxims the reader will find such a life and vigour, that he cannot read them considerately, without find∣ing himself not only seriously but warm∣ly affected; often yielding to the force of them.</P>
<P>The whole of this collection is prin∣cipally
<PB N="viii" REF="034061_0007_0FFA720967739430"/>
intended for the benefit of pri∣vate families, and for those christians who desire to have their hearts warm∣ed with a sense of religion (the necessi∣ty of which every true christian often feels, and of the want of which he of∣ten complains) and who are not well able to purchase larger treatises. And if, by the blessing of Almighty God, it may be subservient to the cause of re∣al religion, and promote a Spirit of true piety, inward as well as outward holiness, I shall have the satisfaction of having been of some service to man∣kind; the reflection of which will be ever sweet on my memory.</P>

<HEAD>Moral observations and instructions.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH few there be that care to be virtuous, yet fewer there are that would not be counted so.</P>
<P>Nothing but what is God's dishonor should be our shame.</P>
<P>We must not walk by example, but by rule.</P>
<P>They that drive a way time, spur a free horse.</P>
<P>As often as a man lays out for God, he lays up for himself.</P>
<P>We have nothing that we can pro∣perly call our own, but what we have reason to be ashamed of.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="034061_0009_0FFA720E4663B630"/>We are never well informed <HI>of</HI> the truth, till we are conformed <HI>to</HI> the truth.</P>
<P>A conceit of knowledge i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great∣est enemy to knowledge, and the great∣est argument of ignorance.</P>
<P>We remember many things we should forget (as injuries, disappoint∣ments, &amp;c.) but forget what we should remember (<HI>viz.</HI> God and our souls.)</P>
<P>They that presume most in prosper∣ity are soonest subject to despair in adversity.</P>
<P>Man may commend thee, but God may condemn thee.</P>
<P>When God punishes another, he threatens thee, when he wounds anoth∣er, he warns thee.</P>
<P>It is as great a mercy to be preserv∣ed in <HI>health,</HI> as to be delivered from <HI>sickness.</HI></P>
<P>If you mind nothing but the body, you lose body and soul too. If you mind nothing but earth, you lose earth and Heaven too.</P>
<P>As they▪ who for every slight infir∣mity take physic to repair their health,
<PB N="3" REF="034061_0010_0FFA7210ADD087E8"/>
do rather impair it; so they, who for every trifle are eager to vindicate their character, do rather weaken it.</P>
<P>Honesty is the best policy, and inno∣cence the best wisdom.</P>
<P>Improve the wit you have bought at a dear rate, and the wisdom you have gained by sad experience.</P>
<P>Learn of Christ, who was sensible of injuries, yet patient under them.</P>
<P>Be lively but not light; solid but not sad.</P>
<P>Keep the body under, but the spirit up.</P>
<P>Keep such company as God keeps.</P>
<P>What can you get by bad company▪ If you are truly good they will either taunt you or despise you.</P>
<P>Take heed of being infected with the breath of a profane heart.</P>
<P>Let the body wait upon the soul, and bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h wait upon God.</P>
<P>Speak not well of yourself, nor ill of others.</P>
<P>Speak of people's virtues, conceal their infirmaties: If you can say no good, say no ill of them.</P>
<P>To render good for evil is God-like▪ to render good for good is man-like▪
<PB N="4" REF="034061_0011_0FFA721321D94498"/>
to render evil for evil is beast-like; to render evil for good is devil-like.</P>
<P>Carry yourself submissively towards your superiors; and frienly towards your equals; condescendingly towards your inferiors; generously towards your enemies; and lovingly towards all.</P>

<HEAD>Of religion in general.</HEAD>
<P>IT signifies nothing to say we will not change our <HI>religion,</HI> if our religion change not <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>If a man lives and dies a mere pro∣fessor, it had been better for him if he had liv'd and dy'd a mere heathen.</P>
<P>The duty of religion flows from a principle of religion.</P>
<P>It is not talking, but walking with God, that gives a man the denom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tion of a christian.</P>
<P>Darkness may as well put on the name of light, as a wicked man the name of a christian.</P>
<P>It is our main business in this world to secure an interest in the next.</P>
<P>A desire of happiness is natural, a de∣sire of holiness is supernatural.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034061_0012_0FFA721595B73058"/>If God hath done that good <HI>for us</HI> which he hath denied <HI>to the world,</HI> we ought to do that service <HI>for him</HI> which is denied him <HI>by the world.</HI></P>
<P>If we are willing, God will help us; if sincere, God will accept us.</P>
<P>A serious remembrance of God is the fountain of obedience to God.</P>
<P>If you forget God when you are young, God may forget you when you are old.</P>
<P>When a christian considers the good∣ness of God's ways, he wonders that all the world doth not walk in them. But when he considers the blindness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> depravity, and prejudice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nature, he wonders that any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> enter upon them.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> your calling sure, and your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> walking, with a neglect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, makes a disconsolate soul. Four things a christian should especial∣ly labor after, <HI>viz.</HI> to be <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>thankful, watchful</HI> and <HI>chearful.</HI></P>
<P>If we would not fall into things un∣lawful, we must sometimes deny our∣selves
<PB N="6" REF="034061_0013_0FFA72180AA41348"/>
in those that are lawful.</P>
<P>Salvation then draws near to man when it is his main care.</P>
<P>The ordinances of God are the means of salvation; but the God of ordinan∣ces is the author of salvation.</P>
<P>Religion must be our business, then it will be our delight.</P>
<P>It will cost something to be religious, it will cost more not to be so.</P>
<P>A christian's life is nothing else but a short trial of his graces.</P>
<P>Luke warmness is the best natural, but the worst spiritual temper a man can be in.</P>
<P>There are few but what are som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣times in a seri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us fit; but how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in a serious frame, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sense of God upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

<P>Do the Lord's work in the Lord's time; pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y whilst God hears; hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; believe whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t God pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ises, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y whilst God commands.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034061_0014_0FFA7219ABC3FAC0"/>That man hath no sense of mercy that wants a sense of duty.</P>
<P>Two duties must run through a christian's life, like the warp through the woof, <HI>blessing</HI> and <HI>trusting.</HI></P>
<P>Religion is much talk'd of, but little understood, till the conscience be awa∣ken'd; then a man knows the worth of a soul and the want of a Saviour.</P>
<P>Then doth religion flourish in the soul, when it knows how to naturalize spiritual things, and to spiritualize na∣tural things.</P>
<P>We may judge of our eternal state by our spiritual state; and of our spir∣itual state by the delightful and custo∣mary actions of our lives.</P>
<P>If we expect to live with Christ in Heaven, we must live to him on earth.</P>
<P>We may expect God's <HI>protection</HI> so long as we keep within <HI>bounds.</HI></P>
<P>Our opportunities are (like our souls) very precious; but if they are lost they are irrecoverably lost.</P>
<P>That preaching that is plain▪ pure, powerful, and practical, men are apt to dislike.</P>
<P>Religion begins with a knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="8" REF="034061_0015_0FFA721C1D2351F0"/>
a man's self, and is perfected with the knowledge of God.</P>
<P>This is a threefold mystery; a gos∣pel published in the midst of an ungod∣ly world; a little church preserved in the midst of devils; and a little grace kept alive in the midst of corruptions.</P>
<P>The service of God is the soul's work; and the favour of God is its reward.</P>
<P>A man may be imperfect in his o∣bedience and yet impartial.</P>
<P>God never fails them that wait for him, nor forsakes them that work for him.</P>
<P>It is a sign of advanc'd grace when opinion is swallowed up of religion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>That there is a God, may be proved by considering the manner of propaga∣tion of mankind by generation. Thus,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) There must have been <HI>one first man.</HI> (2.) This first man must have had some maker. (3.) This maker of him must himself be <HI>unmade.</HI> There∣fore, (4.) There must have been eter∣nally
<PB N="9" REF="034061_0016_0FFA721F6176F888"/>
some <HI>unmade</HI> being; and that is God.</P>
<P>We may <HI>truly</HI> conceive of God, though we cannot <HI>fully</HI> conceive of him.</P>
<P>We may have right apprehensions of him, though not an exact comprehen∣sion of him.</P>
<P>Then our conceptions of God's attri∣butes are carnal, when our high thoughts of one gives us low thoughts of another.</P>
<P>His goodness makes his majesty ami∣able, and his majesty makes his good∣ness wonderful. His love is not abated by his greatness, nor his greatness by his love. His holiness hinders him not from dwelling with the <HI>poor in spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is great enough for him to admire, who is infinite majesty; no∣thing is mean enough for him to des∣pise, who is infinite mercy.</P>
<P>God deals with his servants, not as a passionate master, but as a compas∣sionate father.</P>
<P>What pleaseth God should please us, because it pleaseth God.</P>
<P>A sight of God begins a saint on earth, and perfects him in heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034061_0017_0FFA7221D841BF50"/>God takes notice of every particular man as if there were none else; and yet takes notice of all as if they were but one man.</P>
<P>God repented that he <HI>made</HI> man, but never repented that he <HI>redeemed</HI> man.</P>
<P>We cannot live <HI>naturally</HI> without God, how then can we live <HI>happily</HI> without him?</P>
<P>We may know what God intends <HI>for</HI> us, by what he hath wrought <HI>in</HI> us.</P>
<P>They that have God for their God have angels for their guard.</P>
<P>Many have lost <HI>for</HI> God, but none ever lost <HI>by</HI> God. If they have lost in temporals, they have been eternal gain∣ers, <HI>Matth.</HI> xix 29.</P>
<P>This is a sure rule; <HI>God never takes any thing from his people, but he gives them something better in the stead of it.</HI></P>
<P>God is a great God, and therefore we should wait upon him; he is a good God, and therefore it is not in vain to wait upon him.</P>
<P>A man may be a worshipper of the true God, and yet not a true wor∣shipper of God.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="034061_0018_0FFA722388F3A810"/>The <HI>lowest reverence</HI> is due to the <HI>highest majesty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the fear of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>They that fear God least have the greatest reason to fear him.</P>
<P>A fear of departing from God is a good means to keep us from departing from him.</P>
<P>The more we fear God the less we shall fear men.</P>
<P>They that will not fear God in pros∣perity, will be afraid of him in adversi∣ty.</P>

<HEAD>Of the presence of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>If God's earthly presence is so good, what is his heavenly presence?</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034061_0019_0FFA7226C5D1D288"/>If God's being with us is so sweet, what is it to be with God?</P>
<P>There is joy in God's <HI>gracious</HI> pres∣ence, but in his <HI>glorious</HI> presence there is <HI>fullness</HI> of joy.</P>
<P>There are pleasures in approaching to God here, but at his right hand there are <HI>pleasures for ever more.</HI></P>
<P>The nearer we are to Christ, the nearer is God to us.</P>
<P>The presence of God's glory is in heaven; the presence of his power on earth, the presence of his justice in hell, and the presence of his grace with his people.—If he deny us his pow∣erful presence we fall into nothing; if he deny us his gracious presence we fall into sin; if he deny us his merci∣ful presence we fall into hell.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the love of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>If the love of God set us on work, the God of love will pay us our wages.</P>
<P>God loveth his people to the end, therefore they shall endure to the end.</P>
<P>He loveth them <HI>in</HI> his Son, and <HI>as</HI> his Son and as long as he loveth the Son.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034061_0020_0FFA7229364C2D50"/>We hated God without a cause, and he loved us without a cause.</P>

<HEAD>Of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>Christ made himself like to us, that he might make us like to himself.</P>
<P>Christ must needs have died, how else could sin be expiated, the law sat∣tisfied, the devil conquered, and man be saved?</P>
<P>They that deny themselves <HI>for</HI> Christ, shall enjoy themselves <HI>in</HI> Christ.</P>
<P>Men had rather hear of Christ cru∣cified for them, than be crucified for Christ.</P>

<P>Christ was the great promise of the old testament, the Spirit is the great promise of the new.</P>
<P>Christ's strength is the christian's strength.</P>
<P>If we would stand, Christ must be our foundation; if we would be safe, Christ must be our sanctuary.</P>
<P>In regard of natural life, we live in God; in regard of spiritual life, Christ lives in us.</P>
<P>He that thinks he hath no need of Christ hath too high thoughts of him∣self; he that thinks Christ cannot help him hath too low thoughts of Christ.</P>
<P>Presumption abuses Christ, despair refuses him.</P>
<P>Christ satisfied God to the uttermost, and therefore can save sinners to the uttermost.</P>
<P>The blood of Christ, which satisfied the justice of God, may satisfy the con∣science of an awakened sinner.</P>
<P>If sin was better known, Christ would be better thought of.</P>

<P>Our conscience is as fire within us, our sins as the fewel; therefore, instead of warming, it will scorch us; unless the fewel be removed, or the heat of it allayed by penitential tears.</P>
<P>All true christians must be like <HI>No∣ah's</HI> Ark, that was pitched within and without, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi.14. They must have a holy inside, and a holy outside; their profession and practice must agree to∣gether.</P>

<P>As <HI>Noah's</HI> dove found no footing but in the Ark; so a christian finds no con∣tentment but in Christ.</P>
<P>Our hearts are like instruments of musick well tuned; they will make no melody in the ear of God, unless they be gently touched by the finger of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Christians hearts are as iron; if they be once made hot with the love of God, they will more easily be joined together in love to one another</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="034061_0069_0FFA72A3E6863690"/>As the sun ripens and sweetens fruits by shining upon them, without which they would be sour and unsavory; so it is the sunshine of God's love and favor that sweetens all earthly blessings, without which they would be but cros∣ses and curses to them that possess them.</P>
<P>God's mercies are as cords to draw us to him; but our sins are as sharp swords that cut those cords.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Containing serious advice to youth.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. CHUSE God for your portion; remember that he is the only happiness of a rational and immortal soul. The soul that was made for God can find no happiness but in God: It came from God, and can never be hap∣py but in returning to him again, and resting in him. <HI>Mic.</HI> ii.10. <HI>Arise, for this is not your rest.</HI> Col. iii.1, 2, 3. <HI>If ye be then risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth: for ye are dead▪ and your life is hid with Christ in God.</HI></P>
<P>God is all-sufficient▪ get him for your portion and you have all: Then you have infinite wisdom to direct you, infinite knowledge to teach you, infinite mercy to pity and save you, infinite love to care for and comfort you, and infi∣nite
<PB N="66" REF="034061_0073_0FFA72ADC4264950"/>
power to protect and keep you. If God be yours, all his attributes are yours; all his creatures, all his works of providence, shall do you good, as you have need of them. He is an eter∣nal, full, satisfactory portion. He is an ever-living, ever-loving, ever-pre∣sent friend; and without him you are a cursed creature in every condition, and all things will work against you.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider, that by nature you are dead in trespasses and sin; a child of wrath, a stranger, and enemy to God; and while such, the thoughts of God are terrible to you; you can ex∣pect nothing from him but wrath and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verlasting burnings. God is ever angry with the wicked: His holiness hates all sin; his all-seeing eye behold it, and his justice will punish it.</P>
<P>While you are in a state of nature you can do nothing but sin, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi.5. <HI>Matth.</HI> vii.18. Every thing is a snare, and a wicked heart is apt to be taken. Labour to be sensible of this, and let the sinfulness of your nature be your greatest burden. Strive and labor against this principally. Get purity of
<PB N="67" REF="034061_0074_0FFA72AF68D88718"/>
heart, and a holy life will follow upon it; but if you strive only against out∣ward acts of sin, while your heart is let alone, your labor will be in vain, your heart will tire you out; or if it doth not, yet remember, that God's eye is in the heart, and he hath provided a hell for hypocrites. Nothing more dam∣nable than a wicked unrenewed heart▪</P>
<P N="3">III. Consider, that Christ alone is your way to God. Justification, par∣don, and acceptance with God, is by faith in him alone. Sanctification, and a new nature, is by the power of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit alone. Let Christ therefore be precious to your soul. Labor for true faith in him. Take him for your Lord and Saviour; submit to his commands in all things; and rest your soul upon him alone for reconciliation and peace with God. Open your heart to the motions of his spirit; welcome that principle of a holy and divine life, and be sure to improve his motions, follow his drawings, and by no means grieve him.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Be speedy in your repentance, and diligent in your endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after
<PB N="68" REF="034061_0075_0FFA72B379476FD8"/>
holiness. Know the time of God's gra∣cious visitation. While God is calling, Christ inviting, the gate of heaven set open, the ministers of the word exhort∣ing, and the Spirit drawing, make haste and delay not.</P>
<P>Consider your life is but short, and altogether uncertain. To defer one day may be to our everlasting undoing. When your life is once gone it will be in vain to think of repenting. You shall then have no more sermons, no more offers of Christ and grace, <HI>Heb.</HI> ix.27. God will be patient no more. And if God should take away your life to morrow, you would perish inexcu∣sably for refusing his grace to day. One offer of grace refus'd renders a sinner inexcusable, though God should never offer his mercy more. O, trifle not with your soul! be not careless of e∣ternal happiness. You have heaven and hell, life and death before you, and it depends upon your own hearty choice which shall be your portion: And they are chosen by the choice of the way which leads to them. Chuse life, and chuse it speedily. And remember once
<PB N="69" REF="034061_0076_0FFA72B522A1B130"/>
again, that you have but one life to chuse in. Trifle not away this mo∣ment, upon which depends eternity: Mispend not your short time to your e∣ternal loss.</P>
<P>Stand not upon a short labor; diffi∣culty, self-denial, or suffering, for your eternal happiness. God would have you saved; Christ hath died for you to reconcile you to God; he is ascended into heaven to open the door for your soul to enter in at, and he is interced∣ing with the Father for all grace and mercy for you, if you refuse him not. He came into the world to <HI>seek and to save that which is lost,</HI> Luke xix.10. Be sensible of your sinful, lost, damna∣ble condition without him. O! make ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te to your Saviour, yield to all his demands, and take him as offered in the gospel, in all his offices.</P>
<P N="5">V. Endeavor to be truly and thor∣oughly religious, and be not discour∣aged at the difficulties of it. God's grace shall be sufficient for your help; his promises shall be your sweet encour∣agement; peace of conscience, and communion with God, shall be your
<PB N="70" REF="034061_0077_0FFA72B79D2C46E8"/>
ever present cordials. The trouble and pains of religion shall be but short, and your reward shall be glorious and eter∣nal. Remember that of the Apostle, when religion calls you to self-denial and sufferings, <HI>Our light afflictions that are but for a moment shall work out for us a far more exceding and eternal weight of glory,</HI> 2 Cor. iv.17. <HI>if we suffer with Christ we shall also reign with him,</HI> 2 Tim. ii.12. <HI>and the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be com∣pared with the glory which shall be re∣vealed,</HI> Rom. viii.18. see also, Isa. xliii.2, 3, <HI>when thou passeth through the wa∣ters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of</HI> Israel <HI>thy Saviour.</HI> Never are we more joyful than when we deny our joy for Christ's sake! and if these arguments will not prevail, then consider, that all the pains and difficul∣ties of religion will be found in the end far more tolerable than hell.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Devote your young years to a
<PB N="71" REF="034061_0078_0FFA72BA11829310"/>
good God, and your loving Saviour. The first fruits are to be offered to him. The green ears of your youth are to be carried to his sanctuary. Think it not pity that the vain delights and sinful pleasures of youth should be lost: You shall but exchange them for spiritual delights, which are far more excellent, inward and lasting. The joy of the Holy Ghost, the rejoicing of a good conscience, communion with God, the sense of his love, and the hope of heaven, are far better than the pleasures of sin, and will more than re∣compence your loss of youthful and carnal delights. And consider this se∣riously, that none have usually more comfort in their souls than those, who are willing to lose their sinful comforts for God and their soul's sake.</P>
<P>Remember that you must give an ac∣count to God how you spend your youth, as well as for old age. Consid∣er, as young as you are, how many years are already spent; and what ac∣count you are able to give to God of them. One day spent in sin is too much; and the sins of one hour deserve
<PB N="72" REF="034061_0079_0FFA72BC9C7FBB08"/>
a hell. Younger than you, are dead and gone. Let the thoughts of them mind you seriously of your account. Your call to God's bar may be next. Are you ready? Think often what expence of time may be best accounted for to God; and so spend your younger days, as you will wish you had spent them when you come to die and be judged.</P>
<P>Suppose God should call you away suddenly, what sentence could you ex∣pect from him? Are you ready, if the bridegroom should now come? <HI>Matth.</HI> xxv.6. It will be no excuse at judg∣ment, if you be found in your sins, to say, <HI>Lord, I was but young.</HI> He that is old enough to sin is old enough for hell. You cannot make sure of God's love, and an interest in Christ too soon. You cannot secure your soul too soon▪</P>
<P>Consider those young ones in scrip∣ture who are commended for their ear∣ly piety▪ <HI>Samuel</HI> was ministring to God in his childhood, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ii.18. <HI>Iosiah</HI> had a tender heart for God in his tender years, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xxii.19. <HI>Children</HI> sang hosannas to Christ. <HI>Matth.</HI> xxi.15. <HI>Timothy</HI> was a saint betimes, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="034061_0080_0FFA72BF14AD51D8"/>
iii.15. And let these young ones be your pattern.</P>
<P>The young disciple was the beloved disciple. God takes great delight in an early convert. All your life is due to God, let him therefore have all that still remains, and beg his pardon that any of it hath been denyed.</P>
<P>Repentance is easiest in youth. Sin is less rooted, satan not so fortifyed, grace not so much frighted, the Spirit not so much grieved, and the conscience not so much hardened.</P>
<P>Be sure therefore to give God your youth. Resolve now to be seriously re∣ligions. Now beg for the pardon of your sins, and the spirit of holiness; and though the generality of youth take another course, yet be not swayed by the multitude, and carried down the stream towards hell; let them go, you shall have better company. The saints of God will love you, the angels of God will guard you, and the presence of God himself shall be with you.</P>
<P>And if you find yourself still inclined to be as the most are, and to do as the most do, consider that you cannot have
<PB N="74" REF="034061_0081_0FFA72C191A51AE8"/>
that pleasure in sin which others may. You have had a good education, and good instructions; your conscience hath been more awakened, and will not suffer you to enjoy the pleasures of sin, as others, who are more igno∣rant, and worse educated, may. Con∣science will mix gall with your honey; when you go to prayer, in the evening, upon your bed, when alone and reti∣red, or in the dark, it will read sad lectures to you, and make you review your past delights with bitterness.</P>
<P>Labor therefore to approve yourself to God in youth; and though others may condemn you, yet God (from whose mouth only you must live or die) will acquit and justify you.</P>
<P>And as a conclusion of this advice, let me persuade you to consider, that forsaking sin, when you are most ca∣pable of pleasure or honor by it, and turning to God when your most capable of enjoying the world, will clearly ev∣idence the truth of your conversion. So that a timely conversion to God in youth, as it is most easy, so it is least questionable; for it now appears that
<PB N="75" REF="034061_0082_0FFA72C405B2D108"/>
God is loved for himself, and Christ is preferred above the flesh, and grace above the sweetest delights in the world</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THE great command and duty of the gospel, is, to make self no∣thing, and God all in point of wisdom, strength, righteousness and glory.</P>
<P>And by these things examine all you do: By whose rule have I acted? By whose strength have I acted? In whose name have I acted? And for whose glory have I acted? What faith, what humility, what self-denial, what love of God and Christ, hath there been in all my actions?</P>
<P>Endeavour to make every day the Lord's, to spend it well, and to get nearer heaven by it.</P>
<P><HI>And to this end accept kindly of this advice.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. As soon as ever you awake in the morning, lift up your heart to God, and open it to him. As much as possi∣bly you can, avoid all thoughts about
<PB N="76" REF="034061_0083_0FFA72C679442BE8"/>
the world until your morning devotions are over. For you will find by expe∣rience that, if the world gives your soul the first salute, and be embraced with kindness in your morning affec∣tions, it will greatly deaden your heart in the morning duties.</P>
<P N="2">2. As soon as you are up present your desires to God, in the name of Christ, for whatever your soul feels the want of, and give God his due praises for his mercies towards you the night past. Thus <HI>David, Psal.</HI> v.3. <HI>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee.</HI> And for thanks∣giving, Psal. xcii.1, 2. <HI>It is a good thing to give thanks unto thee, O Lord— to shew forth thy loving kindness in the morning.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let no day go without reading some portion of the scriptures: And it is no great matter, whether you read it before you pray in the morning, or just after; your own inclination and experience will direct you; but be sure it be done. You will find it very prof∣itable to begin the day with such a con∣verse
<PB N="77" REF="034061_0084_0FFA72C903627098"/>
with God. <HI>Prov.</HI> vi.22, 23. <HI>When thou wakest it shall talk with thee.</HI> See <HI>Iohn</HI> v.39. the command of Christ; and <HI>Ioshua</HI> i.8▪ the command of God, with a promise.</P>
<P>The scripture discovers sin, and the devil's devices and malice▪ it discovers duty, and the love of God and Christ; and it discovers your strength and en∣couragements: There are the promises of assisting and crowning grace. By these, the spirit acts, the devil is con∣quered, and the soul is comforted. Through these, the eye of faith can see the love of Christ, the grace of God, and the glory of heaven. In these are the food, the physic, and the arms of the christian's soul. These are the word of reconciliation, grace and truth, and the power of God to salvation: Therefore every day look into these, praying for the spirit's teachings, and mixing faith with what you read.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let all your ordinary or worldly business of the day be done with integ∣rity of heart, and a respect to God, whose servant you ought to be in all
<PB N="78" REF="034061_0085_0FFA72CAAE3C74D0"/>
things. <HI>Psal.</HI> lxxviii.72. Do all things as to the Lord, as in his eye, and according to his will; and your whole day's work will be as it were a reli∣gious worship: This respect will make all holy.</P>
<P N="5">5. Have a care every day that no∣thing put you into a passion: Do no∣thing with an over eagerness of mind; and be ever upon your guard against sudden accidents. And this can never be obtained but by committing your∣self, and your affairs, into God's hand and care every day; believing that he governs all things wisely, and will ever do that which is best for you.</P>
<P>The power, wisdom and goodness of divine providence, must every day be believed by him that would live ev∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry day in peace and tranquillity of soul.</P>
<P N="6">6 Every evening to your prayers a∣gain, and to your praises for that day's mercies. The <HI>Iews</HI> were appointed their evening sacrifices▪ as well as mor∣ning. <HI>Exod.</HI> xxx.7, 8. twice a day is as little as can be allowed to those who are commanded to pray continual∣ly, <HI>Phil.</HI> iv.6. <HI>Thess.</HI> v.17. And
<PB N="79" REF="034061_0086_0FFA72CEC549AB10"/>
every prayer should have its praises in it, <HI>Psal.</HI> xcii.1, 2. <HI>It is good to give thanks unto the Lord—to shew forth his faithfulness every night.</HI> A child will ask his earthly father's blessing at morning and night; and it is better manners, and to better purpose, to ask our heavenly Father's blessing as often. We are ever in want, and God is ever giving; prayers therefore, and praises, are ever suitable and becoming.</P>
<P>Let no day go withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observation, and review of God's carriage towards you, and of yours towards him; of mer∣cies and afflictions; and of your du∣ties, and the frame of heart in them; of your sins or inclinations to sin; and so likewise of any special or remarka∣ble providence of God related to you by others, or seen or read of by yourself. And let God have the glory of what is good. In afflictions be humble, be a∣shamed and grieved for sins; and consid∣er what God's <HI>special</HI> providences speak to you.</P>

<HEAD>Proper reflections for poor Saints.</HEAD>
<P>OUTWARD good things are no sign of God's special Love. The sun of prosperity shines upon the bram∣bles of the wilderness, as well as up∣on the flowers of the garden; and the snow of affliction falls upon the garden as well as upon the wilderness.</P>
<P>What though the streams of creature comforts run low with thee, so that thou hast the more from the spring-head? There is more comfort in one drop that distils immediately from God, than from ten thousand rivers that flow from creature delights.</P>
<P>God doth sometimes on purpose shew us the creatures emptiness, that we may go to his fulness. He makes us see the creatures to be broken cisterns, that we may know him to be the foun∣tain: And that we may feed more
<PB N="81" REF="034061_0088_0FFA72D2F0AC6360"/>
largely upon spiritual dainties, he does deny us carnal ones.</P>
<P>What though God deny thee the earthly jewel, if he gives thee the hea∣venly crown?—If thou hast no por∣tion here thou shalt have a kingdom hereafter; and God is thy portion here, and so long thou shalt not want any good thing. Creature comforts at the best, are only delightful, not satisfy∣ing; pleasant, not gainful!</P>
<P>What if all thy friends forsake thee, so long as God (who is better than all) stands by thee?—Whatever enjoy∣ment friends afford, that God does much more. Do they love thee? He died for thee. Do they pity thee in thine afflictions? In all <HI>thy afflictions he is afflicted,</HI> Isa. lxiii.9 —What wouldest thou have a friend for? For converse? O! taste and see how good and pleasant a thing it is to have com∣munion with God! Hear (if thou canst, and not be ravished) the sweet voice, <HI>I am thine, and thou art mine.</HI> O! feel the pantings of his heart, and hear the soundings of his bowels!—Wouldst
<PB N="82" REF="034061_0089_0FFA72D5697FDB08"/>
thou have a friend to pour out thy breast into? —O! who is so fit for that as God? He will bear part of thy burden if thou art laden, or he will add new strength to sustain it.—His love, his converse, his society, is life itself▪ and such a life as is made up of nothing but sweetness and delight.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sister,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Beseech his most merciful Majesty to send his word and heal you! that we may not have sorrow upon sorrow! —O, if it were his will to restore you for his glory, and the good of many!—And who can tell, but by this affliction he is fitting you for future service? And that the prayers of your many affectionate and faithful friends may be a means of your recovery? Which I hope, through the <HI>thanks∣giving

of many, will red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und to the praise and glory of God.</HI>—But, I be∣lieve, it is not recovery you wish for, any farther than as it will be a mani∣festation of God's pleasure, and an op∣portunity of serving him; it is not <HI>that</HI> you so much desire, as to <HI>depart and to be with Christ, which is indeed far bet∣ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My dear Sister</HI> what thanks can we render unto God who hath visited us with peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, through our dear Redeemer? and hath given us that communion with him here, which is a pledge of our joint communion with him in everlasting glory? Certainly you cannot but re∣member some <HI>Bethels</HI> and <HI>Chebars,</HI> where the Lord hath met you and own∣ed you; some promises which have been made your own; and some <HI>times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.</HI> Blessed be God that you <HI>have a witness in yourself</HI>; and internal evi∣dence, and inward <HI>sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and taste that the Lord is gracious.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord hath acquainted you with that which is the very sum and sub∣stance
<PB N="104" REF="034061_0111_0FFA5E84C15E72D8"/>
of the gospel, <HI>viz. That Christ came into the world to save sinners</HI>: That a christian's thankfulness flows from faith in the promises; That self-deni∣al must run through the whole course of this life, as the warp through the woof: And that Christ is a christian's life, peace▪ hope, and security▪ Whilst he lives we are in safety:
<Q><L>Whilst God is merciful and true,</L>
<L>We are both safe and happy too:</L></Q>
That a christian's important and daily duty is to eye and engage his continual assistance: And that our recovery from daily infirmities must be by a daily re∣course to this ever-living, ever-loving, ever-pleading advocate.</P>
<P>You know also, that submission to the will of God, is a yielding to those methods whereby he is conducting us to eternal happiness and glory; and that every drain of affliction is ordered us by the love of our ever-gracious and all-merciful Father.—Bow then to his sovereignty, and believe his grace: You are in a happy hand; in happy circumstances; all the paths of God

<P>—O That you might live in the Lord's sight—If I knew the present state of your heart, I could bet∣ter tell what to write to you. Howe∣ver, I shall set down some things for your comfort.</P>
<P>Do not say that you are left of God, and there is no hope for you: I tell you there is mercy enough in God, merits enough in Christ, power enough in the Spirit, room enough in heaven, and scope enough in the promises for you.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="034061_0113_0FFA712C9F5FA590"/>Do not say that you are a reprobate, and a cast-away; it is a sin to think so: Every one is bound to hope that he is elected; and, in virtue of that hope, to strive to make his <HI>calling and election sure. The Lord is good to them that wait for him, and to the soul that seeketh him,</HI> Lam. iii.25. There will be doubts and fears, but we must not cherish them. We must not question God's ability to save▪ for he can do all things: Nor m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st we question his willingness to save; for he hath sent his own Son in∣to the world to save us.—Say to thyself, <HI>he hath made me willing to be saved, and is not he willing to save me?</HI> Alas! <HI>my tender mercies are cruel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es in respect of his infinite compassions?</HI> We cannot be so willing to confess sin, as he is to pardon it. We cannot desire to be sa∣ved, so much as he delights to save. None ever trusted him, but they found him a good God.</P>
<P>Therefore my <HI>dear friend,</HI> have hon∣orable thoughts of God▪ though he should hide himself from thee for a moment, yet lift up thy heart to him; in his own time he will make himself
<PB N="107" REF="034061_0114_0FFA713178D6D7A0"/>
known unto you; he will be your own God, for your own dear Saviour's sake.</P>
<P>Perhaps you sit in darkness; but the Lord will be your light. It is darkest a little before the break of day: <HI>Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart</HI>; and it will spring up. <HI>Behold, the husband-man waits for the precious fruits of the earth:</HI> Be patient then, and wait for God in the use of all his means, and the good hour will come.</P>
<P>Perhaps you find a coldness and dead∣ness of heart, and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plain that you cannot serve God with life &amp; affection. This is a complaint of many of God's dear children. But we must do what we can, we must be reading, hearing, praying, waiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon God in his own way, and he will give us his quicken∣ing Spirit.</P>
<P>The world will reproach us; but it r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>proached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e us. We must be willing to follow a suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Saviour in a suffering way. Whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r men say a gainst us, <HI>they</HI> must answer for it, not <HI>we. Only let our conversation be
<PB N="108" REF="034061_0115_0FFA7135963180D8"/>
such as becometh the gospel of Christ.</HI> Let us give <HI>no occasion to his enemies to blaspheme his name.</HI> And he that suf∣fered so much <HI>for</HI> us, O! let him not suffer <HI>by</HI> us.</P>
<P>We must take our rules of living from the word, and not from the world. And the Lord give us wisdom to direct us, and zeal to quicken us in his own blessed ways!—And to con∣firm our obedience and patience, let us remember, that the Lord is coming, and his reward is with him: He is coming to receive us to himself, that <HI>where he is we may be also.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the things of this life, the same love that provided a saviour for thee, will provide all necessary tempo∣ral blessings, for thee: Thy heavenly Father, who knows what is best for thee, will chuse thine inheritance; therefore be not too careful about these things, but rest your care upon him who careth for you. Leave yourself with him for he is <HI>Love,</HI> 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> iv 8. Commit your whole self, soul and bo∣dy, into the hands of infinite love.</P>
<P>Now the Lord of his infinite mercy
<PB N="109" REF="034061_0116_0FFA7137CF3F4260"/>
put his spirit into this dead letter, for the quickening your soul; and I be∣seech him to make it effectual for your eternal good.—I commend you to God, and the word of his grace, and rest your &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sister,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY these lines find you well and happy—E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joy in the thoughts, that your soul is secured in the hands of Christ, and that in this life you are as happy as <HI>content</HI> itself can make you.

<P>O blessed be God, who hath engaged your heart for himself; in the strength of Christ, follow on to know him. How should the way of spiritual thrift be valued and improved by those who are taught of God, where their main and eternal interest lies?

'Tis a provision of spikenard, and precious ointment, against our fu∣neral.—Let us call those our golden hours that are spent with God.</P>
<P>I should now at large commend to you that excellent duty of self-exam∣ination, but that it hath been effectu∣ally pressed upon you by a dear saint now in heaven Nor have I cause to doubt, but as her memory, so her coun∣sels are inviolably preserved in the most inward rooms of your heart.—Ac∣cept the hearty respects of me and mine —most ardently desiring for you all the

<P>HOW hard a thing is it to exercise faith when we have most need of it? And how sad a thing is it, that when we have most need of the Lord's presence and help, we should then es∣pecially grieve him with our doubts and distrusts? However we have this to comfort us, that where the Lord seeth faith in sincerity he will pardon its in∣firmity. —But O! when shall we be∣lieve against sense, and hope against hope?

<P>I REJOICE in God, who hath call∣ed you into the fellowship of his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; and into that grace, wherein you stand. Let us remember, that we are, by nature,
<PB N="121" REF="034061_0128_0FFA715A71D5B0C0"/>
children of wrath, even as others. We might have been cast into hell long a∣go. Were we not provoking sinners? O how did the Lord call upon us, and we regarded him not?—But did the Lord stand and knock, and call till he made us answer, <HI>speak, Lord, for thy servants hear?</HI> Did he give us ears to hear? Would he not let us alone, till he had won our hearts?—O blessed be his name! We might have been blasphemers, persecutors, haters, and despisers of that which is good, at this day. We might have counted the life of religion madness; praying, and professing of religion, fancy and solly. We might have been left to ourselves; all our hope might have been in this life; all our comfort in this world; all our confidence in creatures; and all our heaven upon earth: Hath the Lord caused us to know better things? O let us admire his free grace, now and for ever.!</P>
<P><HI>My friends,</HI> consider how great things the Lord hath done for you. Call to mind your former experience, and live as those whom the Lord hath re∣deemed
<PB N="122" REF="034061_0129_0FFA715F4ABBD550"/>
by his blood. Now you must look upon yourselves as the Lord Christ's, and not your own. Consid∣er <HI>from</HI> what you are called, and <HI>to</HI> what you are called.</P>
<P><HI>Would you live holily, observe these rules.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Live in the eye of God. 2. Ob∣serve the example of Christ. 3. Con∣sider the fruit and end of things. The fruit of sin is shame and sorrow. Sin is a viper in the end: But the fruit of righteousness is peace; holiness is eternal life, in the end.</P>
<P N="4">4. Bind the commandments upon your hearts. 5. Shun the appearances, and the least beginnings of sin. 6. Be frequent and fervent in secret prayer.</P>
<P>My friends, <HI>would you live comfort∣ably, take these directions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Live not so much upon the com∣forts of God, as upon the God of com∣forts. Be afraid of unbelief▪ that is a great sin. Do not greaten your sins above God's saving power. Believe in the word, firmly and constantly. Trust
<PB N="123" REF="034061_0130_0FFA7160EDE5F448"/>
perfectly to the grace and mercy of God in Christ. <HI>I will trust in the mercy of God</HI> (saith <HI>David) for ever and ever,</HI> Psal. lii.8. 2. Beware of sin, espe∣cially of wilful sin: That will bring a cloud, and make a breach between God and your soul. 3. <HI>Do not mind earthly things.</HI> O take heed of unlaw∣ful affections; of an unlawful carriage of the heart; about lawful things. 4. Examine the ways of your heart daily: Search yourselves. <HI>What sin have I committed? What duty have I o∣mitted this day?</HI> Every night look back upon the thoughts and affections, and speeches of the day past. Confess your failings over the head of the <HI>Scape-Goat.</HI> This is another necessary means to keep your peace with God, and to walk comfortably before him: And I pray observe it. 5. Examine your heart farther, and consider the gracious actings and workings of God's blessed Spirit within you; what good thoughts, what good desires, aims, resolutions, God hath put into you. Consider what out-goings of your heart, after God, there have been, what incomes, and
<PB N="124" REF="034061_0131_0FFA71640C4B0C88"/>
influences of his grace. Daily exam∣ine your hearts for these things, and give God the glory of all the gracious workings of his spirit in your soul. 6. If you would walk comfortably with God, mind not what is forged, but what is written. Heed not every fancy the devil may dart into you (for then you lie at the mercy of your ene∣my) but keep close to the written word of God. <HI>Thus it is written,</HI> said our Saviour to satan the tempter.—So much for comfortable walking.</P>
<P>Dear friends; <HI>Would you walk peace∣ably and charitably, take these rules.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Remember God hath called you to peace. 2. Remember when Christ was reviled, <HI>he reviled not again.</HI> 3. If others neglect their duty to you, yet do you not neglect your duty to God, nor to them. Let not another's sin cause you to sin: To render railing for railing, is to return sin for sin 4. You must shew your love to God, whom you have not seen, by your love to your brother, whom you see daily.
<PB N="125" REF="034061_0132_0FFA7165B8FC5930"/>
Shew your piety by your charity. 5. Consider that an unbridled tongue is a sign of an unsanctified heart. They that have not a dram of grace to tame their tongues, shall one day want a drop of water to cool the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r tongues. 6. Do good to others, if they do not thank you for it. The less reward you have on earth, the greater shall your reward be in heaven: As the less wa∣ges the servant takes up within his year, the more comes in at the year's end.</P>
<P>Dear friends; <HI>Would you be constant in good ways and purposes, take these di∣rections.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Remember you have engaged yourselves to God, and therefore you must keep yourselves from idols. You have given up your names to God, and you must give up your hearts to God. You have made a covenant with God by sacraments. If satan or the world are suiters for your hearts, tell them, <HI>you are already disposed of; you are pre-engaged to God; you have chosen your
<PB N="126" REF="034061_0133_0FFA7169033AE780"/>
God, and you must not think of changing him.</HI> 2. Consider whither would you go from Christ? Where do you think to find such another God as your God; such another friend as Jesus Christ? 3 Remember, if it be good to draw near to God, it is better to draw nearer to him: Still the nearer the better. One may see an end of earthly perfec∣tion; but there is no end of the perfect¦ion of Jesus Christ. 4. Be downright for God; and you shall find soul-hearting comfort in God, that shall keep you close to God. 5. Walk humbly with God; that is the way to walk closely with God. If a christian is humble, he is a christian indeed: God will not suffer such a one to be tempted above his strength. 6. Let not opinions swim in your heads; that will make you fall: But let the great things of religion sink into your hearts, and that will make you stand. Be content, yea, willing to suffer for Christ; who did so contentedly and willingly suffer for you. And if you suffer with him, you shall be glorified together.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>my dear friends,</HI> the Lord be
<PB N="127" REF="034061_0134_0FFA716B72995E80"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be long; and then it will ap∣pear whether they ever seriously ap∣plied themselves to Christ. <HI>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.</HI> Nothing but condemnation to them that are out of him. Faith makes Christ ours. This consists in <HI>self-deni∣al,</HI> and <HI>self-resignation.</HI> We must see our sins, so far as to abhor ourselves; abhor ourselves, so far as to deny our∣selves; deny ourselves, so far as to re∣sign ourselves up into the saving arms of an only Saviour. They that do this, are <HI>pardoned, sanctified, saved for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Now let me intreat you to ask your own heart some questions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hath sin been laid to my hêart? hath it been my greatest burden?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have I confessed my particular sins, and the sinfulness of my nature, with sor∣row?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Have I been forced to make my ap∣peal to Christ, knowing that I am lost for ever, unless he freely save me? Have I cried for a Christ, as a condemned man for a pardon?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Do I believe he is able and willing to save me? Do I believe that he that
<PB N="129" REF="034061_0136_0FFA71706207B738"/>
spread his arms on the cross to die for me, spreads his arms now in the gospel, and in heaven, to save me? Have I plea∣ded his promises? O what a precious promise is that,</HI> John vi.37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Have I had joy and peace in be∣lieving? Hath Christ, relied on, calm∣ed and quieted my poor troubled afflict∣ed soul?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Do I love Christ more than riches, honors, pleasures? Do I love all his or∣dinances? Do I love all his saints?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Do I hate sin in itself? Do I hate sin in myself? Do I hate every sin? ev∣ery false way?</HI></P>

<P>THOUGH providence hath sepa∣rated us, yet it refresheth me to think upon you, and that I am interest∣ed in your prayers as you are in mine. Well, if we are met in Christ, we shall meet upon the bench in the great day of assize, and before a throne of glo∣ry in our Father's kingdom. In the mean while, our God is with us both whilst we are with him. In his pre∣sence is <HI>fulness of joy.</HI> It is not so much the change of place, as the <HI>pre∣sence of God,</HI> which makes heaven. <HI>There</HI> is heaven where God shines and
<PB N="135" REF="034061_0142_0FFA717BC25D87A0"/>
manifests himself. When a soul can say, <HI>I would not go to heaven, if it were not to meet God there; and if I should be cast into the flames of hell, I could not find in my heart to blaspheme God;</HI> the exercise of such a meditation will great∣ly help her against temptations.</P>
<P>Many a good soul doth not know how much she loves God; but when she feels that affection stirring within her.—O then, she is in a new, serene, comfortable frame! Satan flies. <HI>Per∣fect love casts out fear. Love God, and praise God,</HI> and all is at peace. Nay, admit the soul hath not got full assu∣rance of her pardon; yet if she sets down this resolution—<HI>Let God be glorified whatever become of me. Let the angels praise him; let the saint praise him; let the</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles <HI>be call∣ed in to praise him; and if it may please his divine majesty, let my poor unworthy soul please him, and be a praise to his grace for ever and ever</HI>: if it can say this, it must be happy with it. That must needs be a happy soul that breathes forth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> praises of God, ascribes all glory to God, and can sing,

<L>The glory of my glory still shall be,</L>
<L>To give all glory and myself to thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Lord put and keep your heart in a praising frame. O how well doth this angelical and evangelical disposition befit and become those, who of sinners are made saints; of enemies, children; of slaves, heirs; of burning brands, shining stars! When we consider seri∣ously what we have been, and what we <HI>might</HI> have been, nay, what we <HI>must</HI> have been, if infinite mercy had not prevented; (as the Lord, was seen in the mount, when <HI>Isaac</HI> day bound up∣on the alter, mercy came in between the knife and the sacrifice) instead of scourged, how nobly pardoned &amp; promo∣ted! raised from devils to angels com∣pany▪ from the lowest depth to the greatest height; this (I say) if we con∣sider it, is matter of admiration, not of expression.

That thou shouldst make thy self glorious in our glory, who had made ourselves vile in dishonoring thy name?—O, let us give him our whole souls, who hath redeemed them by his blood!

Be∣sides, I am glad Almighty God hath so far enlightened your mind, to see so much of the evil of sin as to be displea∣sed with yourself for being no more displeased at it. It is some argument of softness, when the stone grates upon the flesh, and makes it bleed.

<P>I THANK you for your letter. God hath blessed me with a son; and we are all in good health, God be praised. My brother <HI>Wyat</HI> was sud∣denly taken away, and my sister is left a poor sorrowful widow. See the course and fashion of the world; first the birth of a son, then the death of a brother. God never changes, never dies. Happy are they that have God for their God? They are sure of some∣thing, or rather of all. If a man had the whole world he were sure of no∣thing—There is nothing like close communion with God. Watching and praying, and peace with God, makes a man's life comfortable in despite of all the rage and fury of earth or hell. Follow on to know God and you shall know him more. The Lord stablish your heart with grace, and give you a further experience and liking of his good ways.—It would be much to my satisfaction to hear of your proficiency

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for your letter. I earn∣estly desire your proficiency and comfort in the <HI>good ways of God</HI>▪ A christian must be <HI>humble</HI> but never <HI>dis∣couraged.</HI> The first is a duty; the se∣cond is a sin. Though the bare talk∣ing of the lips tends only to penury;
<PB N="159" REF="034061_0166_0FFA71B802F074E8"/>
yet talking of God, and of the things of God, from the heart, is part of the christian practice, especially among those that are endued with a sense of re∣ligion. <HI>Our words must be savoury, seasoned with salt; tending to edification; and such as may minister grace to the hearers.</HI></P>
<P>I commend to you secret duties. <HI>A christian is what he is between God and his own soul.</HI> Go to God for God; go not from God without God: Seek his face in Christ. Endeavour for a sense of his favor, and the supply of his spi∣rit. You have the blessed and most worthy name of Christ to speed your requests; therefore let nothing lie up∣on your heart to trouble you. It is not only a suffering but a sin, to let any thing lie upon our heart to trouble us, when we have a God that bids us <HI>cast all our care upon him.</HI> God will deal familiarly with you; he will be all things to you, if you depend upon him. If your spirit flags or faints, search the cause of this untowardness and averseness, and conclude it is not well with you till you have recovered
<PB N="160" REF="034061_0167_0FFA71BA71461AF0"/>
a cheerful, obedient frame of heart, that you can say from your soul, <HI>Lord, whom have I in heaven but thee? Whom have I in earth but thee?</HI></P>
<P>Two things resolve upon by the grace of God, <HI>viz. To judge yourself; and to judge no body else.</HI> God requires these two things, <HI>to be severe towards yourself; and charitable towards others.</HI> This will bring you comfort. Attend to the vitals and essentials of religion; they will nourish the life and power of Godliness in your heart.</P>
<P>Three things make a christian, <HI>viz. Repentance towards God; faith in our Lord Iesus Christ; and sincere and uni∣versal obedience.</HI> Mind these three things, and the God of peace shall be with you.— Assure yourself, there is such a thing as religion in the world, though some deride it, and others fals∣ly pretend to it. There is such a thing as communion with God.—Seek comfort in God through Christ, there it is to be found; rest not till you have found it and then your soul will say. <HI>This is that I would have; this satis∣fies and refreshes.</HI> If a man hath his
<PB N="161" REF="034061_0168_0FFA71BCF2FAA4D8"/>
chest full of treasure, what cares he though he be called a poor man; he hugs himself, and saith, <HI>Populus me si∣bilat, at mihi plaudo.</HI> So if a man be judged a hypocrite it matters not, so long as he hath the evidence of his sin∣cerity in his bosom; a testimony with∣in that he hath pleased God.—In a great house there are grooms and scullions, yet we say, it is not their house, it is such a nobleman's house, he owns it; so there is not a christian in the world but hath vile slaves lodg∣ing within him, but Christ is the <HI>Lord of the house.</HI> Corruption rebels, but grace reigns, There are two houses, two parties, Christ's side and the dev∣il's; and a conflict between them. If it were not so; if it were not for this inward conflict, earth would be heav∣en; for outware opposition would be nothing, if it were not for this inward Corruption. Well but <HI>Quod non placet, id non nocet. If sin be our grief and ha∣tred it shall not be our ruin.</HI> Christ's side shall prevail.</P>

<P>IT is the duty of every true christian to give God the glory of his grace. We can never bless God enough for his patience, that hath kept us so long out of hell; nor for his mercy, that so earnestly invites us to heaven. Is it nothing, that the Lord is continually following us with terms of peace, and tenders of mercy, and beseeching us to be reconciled?—Say not in your heart, I have nothing of Christ in me, because you have not attained to such perfection and assurances as you desire. It was the saying of a good christian. I bless God for a good thought. Bless
<PB N="163" REF="034061_0170_0FFA71C297FBC540"/>
God for any token of his love; any portion of his spirit. Thou canst not say, thy sins are forgiven thee; but canst thou not say, they are confessed; they are confessed over the head of the <HI>Scape-goat</HI>? Dost thou heartily confess thy sins unto God, with all their aggra∣vations? O! it is a great mercy.— Thou canst not say, thou hast an in∣terest in Christ; but hath not Christ an interest in thee? Hath he not won thine heart and affections? O! it is a great mercy.— Thou sayst possibly, I am not worthy to be called a child of God. But doth not God receive and treat thee as a father? The prodigal (<HI>Luke</HI> xv.) acknowledged he was not worthy to be called the son; but yet his Father received him.— Again, it may be thou complainest of sin; but is it with thee as it was for∣merly? Shouldest thou not bless God for some amendments? If a sick man be any thing bettered in health (though he still be very bad, yet) he will tell his friends, he is somewhat better than he was, and he blesses God for it. Be∣sides, tho' sin dwells in thee, yet, per∣haps,
<PB N="164" REF="034061_0171_0FFA71C438E5EB00"/>
it is the grief of thy soul: Thou art its captive not its convert. As sin is against thy soul, so is not thy soul a∣gainst sin? If it be thy grief it shall not be thy ruin.</P>
<P>Again 'it may be thine heart is troub∣led in an hour of temptation but hast thou not sometimes enjoyed sweet peace with God? Were not thine earthly delights vain? Canst thou not say now, <HI>O quam sauve est istis sauvi∣tatibus carere? One quarter of an hour's communion with God is worth all the de∣lights in the world?</HI> Canst thou not call to mind some of God's former lov∣ing-kindnesses? Hast thou not some∣times tasted and seen how good the Lord is?—What a mercy is that! —Again, thou art not assured of heaven, and thou wantest an assurance thereof. But thou hast such hopes of heaven as thou wouldest not exchange for all the kingdoms of the world; and shouldest thou not bless God for that? Which is more to thee than all the world?—Again, thou sinest thro' mistake or passion. But canst thou find in thine heart to sin against God?
<PB N="165" REF="034061_0172_0FFA71C6A7BB9D98"/>
He that is born of God cannot sin; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is, he cannot find in his heart to sin; because he is born of God.— A∣gain, it may be thou complainest of a dead heart. But is there not some life in thee? Deadness stands in opposition to liveliness as well as life. If thou art dead, that is, not lively, yet bless God that thou art not quite dead in trespasses and sins.—Again, it may be that thou complainest of a hard heart. But thy heart is not so hard but it feels its hardness. Did <HI>Pharaoh</HI> complain of the plague of a hard heart? He felt it not▪ he was all stone. But if thy heart feels its hardness, 'tis a sign there is something of flesh. Bless God for that covenant-mercy, a heart of flesh.—Again, it may be the Lord tarri∣eth or hideth himself from thee. But art thou not willing to wait upon him, and to wait for him? Dost thou wait under his table for crumbs▪ Dost thou wait at his gate for mercy? Well, the Lord is good to them that wait for him, <HI>Lam.</HI> iii.25.— Again, it may be thou complainest, thou art of∣ten

out of frame, or of an uneven tem∣per; sometimes praying, sometimes sinning, &amp;c. But though thou art not always the same, yet God is, and Jesus Christ is; and therefore it is that we are not consumed.—Again, it may be thou thinkest thou shalt never be a∣ble to suffer for Christ, thy weak na∣ture shrinks and trembles at the thot's of it; thou art afraid thou shalt rath∣er deny thy Saviour, than thy name, thy liberty, or thy life. It is true, if thou shouldest be left to thyself, it would be so; but God is faithful, and he will not suffer thee to be tempted a∣bove what thou art able to bear. He will not send thee into a wood to fell an oak with a penknife. When he calls thee to the work thou never didst, he will give thee the strength thou nev∣er hadst—Again, it may be, thou fearest thou shalt fall away, and never hold out to the end, but doth not this fear of thine rather secure thee than betray thee? Does it not quicken thee to duty, to watch and pray, &amp;c. It is a mercy if it be such a fear and tremb∣ling as thou art working out thy salva∣tion

by. But wherefore dost thou doubt? Hath God ever failed thee at thy need? When the disciples began to be concerned about bread; saith our Saviour, <HI>do you not remember how many baskets full ye took up</HI> at such a time? &amp; how many at such a time? <HI>Are your hearts still hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned?</HI> So say I, remem∣ber how God hath comforted you at such a time, or such a time, and be not faithless but believing.—The Lord inspire your heart with courage and comfort, that you may persevere in his good ways unto the end.

<P>I Hope there is an indissoluble knot between us that neither silence nor distance can break in pieces; I mean the unity of the spirit; which will out∣stand all carnal alliances, founded in blood or marriage; and all temporary confederacies grounded upon interest or temper.

O! for the blood of the ever∣lasting covenant, to wash away my sins, &amp; to deliver me from the wrath to come.</HI> You come well out of your afflictions, if you are more serious, more cautious, and more circumpect; more watch∣ful and prayerful, more spiritual and heavenly-minded.</P>
<P>Death is a good debt and must be paid. <HI>The clouds return after the rain.</HI> O prepare carefully for your latter end. What time you have to spare from your worldly occasions, spend in your soul concernments. Accustom your∣self to prayer, to good thoughts, to reading of good books, especially God's book. <HI>Labor to be what all wish they had been when they come to die.</HI> Con∣sider

<P>THE Lord be with you! The Lord shine upon you in the face of Christ.—O seek the face and favor of God. He that findeth Christ, findeth life; he findeth the sweetest of all blessings; he findeth the pearl of great∣est price. Christ is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. Sin will find us out, if Christ do not hide us. But he spreads his wing, and calls us to come under it. The

Lord bring you under the wing of Christ! under covenant protection, my dear friend, that your soul may be sa∣ved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Beg not only pardon but purity of heart, desire a new nature, that you may serve the Lord in newness of life. Watch and pray against sin; and every night examine yourself how you have spent the day. Bless the Lord for what good he hath enabled you to do, and confess, and be humbled if you have thought or spoke, or done any e∣vil. Walk as in the sight of God, speak as in the hearing of God; do all things as in his presence, who is our judge.</P>
<P>I commend you to the infinite love of God, and rest,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Desire your happiness in all respects, and that God who gives you health and strength for your earthly calling, may enable you for the duties of your heavenly calling; and that whilst your hand is in the world, your heart may be in heaven.</P>
<P>I hope you do conscientiously observe God's sabbaths, and delight in his or∣dinances, and that you experience the sweetness of communion with God, and of his service, which is perfect free∣dom. I desire that you may continue in well-doing, that you may be faith∣ful to the death, that you may receive a crown of life. To keep a conscience void of offence, must be your daily ex∣ercise, and it shall be your daily com∣fort.</P>
<P>I hope you visit the throne of grace daily, and find prayer to be your chief delight, and the best of your fare. Confess what you find amiss in your∣self. Beg pardon and sanctification.

<P>YOUR condition puts me in mind of a speech of <HI>Iacob.—And now I must provide for my own house also.</HI> I desire the Lord may dwell in your heart and in your house, the patri∣archs were wont, where they pitched, there to rear altars; never accounting

themselves settled till the worship of God was settled among them.</P>
<P>My friend, <HI>if the Son make you free, then are you free indeed; and where the spirit of the Lord is, therê is liberty. I hope you are in Christ, and have the spirit of Christ dwelling in you.</HI>— Then are you free from the law of sin and death.</P>
<P>I desire your house may be a <HI>Bethel,</HI> not a <HI>Bethaven</HI>; a house of God, and not a house of vanity. I desire that prayers and praises may there be as∣cending, and mercies and blessings de∣scending. He that provideth not for the bodies of his family is worse than an infidel; he that provideth only for the bodies of his family is no better than an infidel.</P>
<P>You will see that all that are within your gates keep holy the sabbath-days. That will make happy week-days.— The Lord bless you in your soul, and in your body, in your person, and in your family; in your basket, and in your store; in your going out, and in your coming in, from this time forth, and for ever more. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
