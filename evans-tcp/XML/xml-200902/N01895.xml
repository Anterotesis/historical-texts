<HEAD>AN ATTESTATION <HI>From the very Reverend,</HI> Dr. <HI>Increase Mather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving been Solicited several Times, to Declare my judgment, concerning the Endeavours of Some, to recover our Psalmody, unto that Regular Singing, which is reported now to be somewhat lost in many Places; I take this Oppor∣tunity to Signify, That I have perused the Book Entituled, <HI>The Accomplish'd Singer;</HI> and I Entirely Concur to the Sentiments, and Proposals, which are offered in that <HI>Essay;</HI> and I would En∣courage, especially our Younger People, to Learn the Skill, by which they may Sing Regularly; that so this Part of Divine Worship may be more beautifully carried on, and more generally delighted in; But above all, to be most careful of the more Spiritual Part, that with Grace in their Hearts, they may always make Melody to the LORD.</P>

<HEAD>A PROPOSAL.</HEAD>
<P>IT is Proposed, That the PASTORS of the Churches, would frequently use, a short <HI>Expository Preface</HI> (which need not extend beyond Four or Five Minutes) upon that Paragraph of a PSALM which is going to be Sung in the Congre∣gation: A short <HI>Exposition,</HI> expressing the <HI>Lessons</HI> of PIETY to be found in the Verses now to be Sung, and the <HI>Tempers</HI> or <HI>Wishes</HI> of PIETY which they are to be Sung withal. What a marvellous Im∣provement in PIETY; Yea, what a Consort with the <HI>Multitude of the Hea∣venly Host,</HI> would there follow upon such a Proposal duely Prosecuted!</P>

<HEAD>The Accomplished <HI>SINGER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ 1. <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is the Concern of every one that would enjoy <HI>Tranquillity</HI> in this World, or obtain <HI>Felicity</HI> in the World to come, to fol∣low that Holy Direction of Hea∣ven, <HI>Exercise thy self in PIETY.</HI> And there is no <HI>Exercise</HI> of PIE∣TY more unexceptionable than that of <HI>making a Joyful</HI> Noise of SINGING in the Praises of our GOD; That of signifying our <HI>Delight</HI> in Divine <HI>Truths</HI> by SINGING of them; That of <HI>Uttering</HI> the Sentiments of Devotion, with the <HI>Voice,</HI> and such a <HI>Modulation of the Voice,</HI> as will naturally express the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> which a Grave SONG shall be expressive of. 'Tis indeed a very <HI>Ancient Way</HI> of Glorifying the Blessed GOD; As <HI>Ancient</HI> as the Day <HI>when the Foundations of the Earth were fastened,</HI> and <HI>the Corner-Stone thereof was laid.</HI> The
<PB N="2" REF="002241_0007_0FDAD6964BF8E160"/><HI>Morning-Stars</HI> then <HI>Sang together.</HI> And it is as <HI>Exten∣sive</HI> an one; For it is Remarkable, That <HI>All Nations</HI> make SINGING to be one part of the <HI>Worship</HI> which they pay unto their GOD. Those Few <HI>Untuned Souls,</HI> who affect upon Principle to distinguish themselves from the rest of Mankind, by the Character of <HI>Non-Singers,</HI> do seem too much to divest themselves of an <HI>Humanity,</HI> whereof it may be said unto them, <HI>Doth not Nature it self teach it you?</HI> Be sure, they sufficiently differ from the <HI>Primitive Christians;</HI> For, though the <HI>Eastern</HI> Churches were at first Superiour to the <HI>Western,</HI> for the <HI>Zeal of the House of GOD</HI> in this matter, yet both betimes Concurr'd in it. Not only <HI>Justin</HI> the <HI>Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as well as <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and several others of the <HI>Primitive Writers,</HI> but also Governour <HI>Pliny</HI> himself will tell us, what <HI>Singers to their GOD,</HI> the Faithful were then known to be; and how much they <HI>Worshipped</HI> Him in these <HI>Beauties of Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>§ 2. BUT this piece of <HI>Natural Worship</HI> is further Confirmed by a <HI>positive Institution</HI> of GOD our SA∣VIOUR for it. The <HI>Sacred Scriptures</HI> with which the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has Enriched us, have directed us unto this <HI>Way</HI> of Worshipping. In our <HI>Old Testament</HI> we there find it as a Command of GOD; but Calculated particularly for Times under the <HI>New-Testament:</HI> Psal. LXVIII. 32. <HI>Sing Praises unto GOD, ye Kingdoms of the Earth, O Sing Praises unto the Lord.</HI> And Psal. C. 1, 2. <HI>Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord, All ye Lands; Come into his Presence with Singing.</HI> The <HI>Ninety-fifth Psalm</HI> in our Psalter, does according to the Interpretation of our Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> an <HI>Interpreter, One of a Thousand,</HI> certainly to be relied upon! — Prescribe the <HI>Duties</HI> of a <HI>Sabbath</HI> in the Days of the Gospel. But what is the <HI>First</HI> of those Duties? <HI>O come, Let us Sing unto the Lord, Let us with Psalms make a Joyful Noise unto Him.</HI> In our <HI>New-Testament</HI> it self
<PB N="3" REF="002241_0008_0FDAD6A20E0508F8"/>'tis a Thing so positively enjoined, that it must be a wonder, if any Christian can make any Question of it. How plainly is it commanded? Jam. V. 13. <HI>Is any cheerful among you, Let him sing Psalms.</HI> Yea, In the <HI>Pauline</HI> Epistles, we have it; how frequently, how earnestly inculcated! This Exercise is none of those <HI>Intrusions</HI> into our <HI>Worship,</HI> which the <HI>Worshippers in the Inner-Court,</HI> wou'd see a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> serv'd upon, 'Tis <HI>Warranted</HI> with a most Incontestible <HI>Insti∣tution.</HI></P>
<P>§ 3. THE <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> which have <HI>Directed</HI> us to <HI>Sing unto the Lord, and Bless His Name;</HI> have also <HI>supplied</HI> us with an admirable and sufficient <HI>Matter</HI> for our <HI>Songs.</HI></P>
<P>WE have a PSALTER, whereof the biggest part is of PSALMS, that were Composed by <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>sweet Singer of Israel;</HI> A <HI>David,</HI> who being the <HI>Last</HI> of the Limitations which the Glorious GOD made of the <HI>Line,</HI> wherein the <HI>First Promise</HI> was to be ac∣complished, GOD for the sake of that REDEEMER, distinguished him, with doing of amazing Things for him, and by him; whereof <HI>This</HI> was one, that he was made the greatest <HI>Instrument</HI> for assisting the Devotions of the Church, that ever was in the World. The rest were Composed by other <HI>Holy Men of GOD, who wrote as they were moved by the Holy SPIRIT.</HI></P>
<P>IN both <HI>Testaments,</HI> we have Composures under a <HI>Poetical Dress,</HI> fitted unto <HI>Tunes,</HI> that were then known in the Church of GOD. The most <HI>Ancient Song</HI> that is now extant in the World is That in the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Exodus:</HI> In which there is a surprizing <HI>Pro∣phecy</HI> of what is to be Sung upon the <HI>Perdition</HI> of <HI>Anti-christ.</HI> Except the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> which (all but the Two first Chapters, and the Last,) is a <HI>Poem</HI> writ in Verse, might (perhaps by <HI>Moses,</HI> making a present of it unto his Country-Men under their <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Captivity) be written before it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002241_0009_0FDAD69D12867650"/>
THE astonishing Song, in the Thirty second Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> was prepared in the Heavenly World, and sent from thence by <HI>Moses,</HI> to be a per∣petual <HI>Witness</HI> for GOD, among the Sons of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>THE Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> is a Rare <HI>Poem,</HI> and one that it seems the Wicked <HI>Homer</HI> was no more a Stran∣ger to, than he was to our <HI>Eighteenth Psalm,</HI> when he formed the cursed <HI>Iliad,</HI> with which he brought in upon the World, a Flood of Debaucheries and Im∣pieties.</P>
<P>IN the Song of <HI>Hannah,</HI> we have the Name of The MESSIAH, first mentioned.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Song of Songs</HI> penned by <HI>Solomon,</HI> we have the promised MESSIAH, whom his Father had Sung in our <HI>Forty fifth Psalm,</HI> appearing in the Habit of a <HI>Royal High-Priest,</HI> and the Espousal between Him and His Church, (the <HI>Tipheret</HI> and the <HI>Maleuth</HI>) celebrated, with Metaphors, wherein <HI>he spake of Trees,</HI> and produced a Noble <HI>Pastoral.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Proverbs</HI> (except the Nine first Chapters,) gives us, as it was the Custom of Anti∣quity, the <HI>Maxims of Wisdom,</HI> in such a way as to be <HI>Sung</HI> among the People.</P>
<P>IN the Volumn of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> there are more than One or Two <HI>Songs,</HI> (besides that of, <HI>The Vineyard,</HI>) which are of a lofty strain, and full of Evangelical Mysteries. That of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> is transcendently wor∣thy to be <HI>Printed in a Book; to be graven with an Iron pen and Lead in the Rock forever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> has Two Chapters, wherein the <HI>Tears given in great Measure,</HI> to the Peo∣ple of GOD, are Poetically <HI>measured.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Habakkuk</HI> has in it, a Song, than which, can any thing be more <HI>Sublime</HI> or <HI>Seraphic?</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Zacharias,</HI> have more than a little of, <HI>The Wonderful,</HI> in them.</P>
<P>'TIS not long, before the <HI>Multitude of the Hea∣venly Host,</HI> invite us to a Consort with <HI>them,</HI> in One
<PB N="5" REF="002241_0010_0FDAD6B9B91E0260"/>of the <HI>Songs</HI> which will enable us to <HI>speak</HI> (and sing) <HI>with the Tongue of Men and Angels.</HI> The Expiring <HI>Simeon</HI> mounting up to Heaven, <HI>Sings as he Mounts.</HI></P>
<P>ANON, in the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> we have more <HI>Songs</HI> in which we over hear the <HI>Holy Ones</HI> in the Heavenly World, Glorifying our GOD and SAVIOUR; And, <HI>O lifted up to Heaven we,</HI> in these Communications!</P>
<P>HERE is our PSALTER! And were we enriched with no more Treasures than These, wherein the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has thus provided for the <HI>Songs</HI> of His People, what a precious Article in, <HI>The Unsearchable Riches of</HI> CHRIST, have we therein to be exceedingly Thankful for?</P>
<P>BUT supposing that we have no <HI>other Portions</HI> of the Inspired Writings exhibited in the <HI>Tuneable Poetry</HI> of the Ancients, must we thence conclude, that we are forbidden to put any other <HI>Portions</HI> of them into such a <HI>Metre,</HI> as may render them capable of being <HI>Song</HI> among the People of GOD? Surely, the Ser∣vants or GOD may take other <HI>Paragraphs</HI> of our BIBLE, especially such as have the most Illustrious <HI>Mystecies of the Gospel,</HI> so plainly Contained and Re∣vealed in them, that in <HI>Singing</HI> thereof, we shall <HI>shew forth the Salvation of</HI> GOD, and they may with the <HI>Singing</HI> thereof, <HI>Give Thanks unto the Lord,</HI> as it becomes <HI>the Redeemed of the Lord.</HI> Yea, The Great &amp; Good <HI>Voe∣tius</HI> does not scruple to say, <HI>Nihil alrenum ab usu Scrip∣turae fe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erint, qui symbolum, quod vocant, Apostolicum, et Decalogum, ad Numeros et Modulos redegerunt.</HI></P>
<P>§ 4. THE <HI>Songs</HI> which are <HI>prepared</HI> for us by the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, in the <HI>Inspired Writings,</HI> that <HI>shine in this Dark Place,</HI> ought certainly to be <HI>preferred</HI> with us, before any meer <HI>Human Composures,</HI> in the <HI>Public Worship of the Faithful.</HI> Those which for their Original are peculiarly the <HI>Songs of Zion,</HI> are the most proper to be used in its <HI>Assemblies.</HI> 'Tis
<PB N="6" REF="002241_0011_0FDAD6A4934063F8"/>true, Devout <HI>Hymns</HI> Composed by the Good Men of our own Time, affected with the Truths of GOD, and able to <HI>Handle the Pen of the Writer,</HI> for soaring Poetry, may be used, and found <HI>good for the Use of Edifying.</HI> From <HI>Tertullian</HI> we Learn, that in his early Days, the Christians used even such <HI>Hymns</HI> as were conceived by themselves, <HI>de proprio Ingenio. Socrates</HI> mentions the <HI>Psalms</HI> written by <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> mentions the <HI>Psalms</HI> written by <HI>Nepos.</HI> The <HI>Arians</HI> made many <HI>Hymns</HI> to be Sung, for the Pro∣pagation of their <HI>Heresies:</HI> And the <HI>Orthodox</HI> willing to be <HI>made wise from their Enemies,</HI> made <HI>Hymns</HI> for the Preservation of the <HI>Faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI> Yea, <HI>Great was the Army</HI> of them, who followed <HI>Am∣brose</HI> in the Publishing of <HI>Hymns</HI> for the use of the Latin Church. The <HI>Te Deum</HI> ascribed unto <HI>Ambrose,</HI> makes to this Day a mighty Noise in the World. The <HI>German Psalter</HI> has in it <HI>Hymns</HI> of <HI>Luthers</HI> Composing. And in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Churches of the later Days, they had a <HI>Cantional</HI> in which there were seven hundred and forty <HI>Sacred Songs</HI> besides the <HI>Davidical Psalms.</HI> But certainly, the <HI>Hymns</HI> of <HI>Uninspired</HI> Men, cannot be so <HI>Profitable</HI> for all <HI>Instruction in Righteousness,</HI> and may not have so much Respect paid unto them, as those that are <HI>given by Inspiration of GOD. Austin</HI> did well to blame the <HI>Donatists,</HI> for leaving the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> and Singing <HI>Hymns</HI> of their own Invention. Yea, if the Limitations ordered by a Synod at <HI>Bracara,</HI> were perhaps a little too strict, <HI>Extra Psalmos veteris Testamenti, nihil Poetice Compositum, in Ecclesia Psallatur,</HI> yet it was a Wise order passed in a Synod at <HI>Laodicea,</HI> that forbad <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Private Psalms</HI> to be used in the Church. The French Churches, have wisely confined themselves unto the <HI>Scriptural Songs;</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Har∣monized with them, in passing that Order, <HI>In Ecclesiis cantabuntur Psalmi Davidis, Omissiscanticis quae in S. Scrip∣tura nou reperiuntur.</HI> Can any thing be so Rich, so Full, so sublime, as what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD
<PB N="7" REF="002241_0012_0FDAD6BB397BE1A0"/>has declared? Every Line will weigh against a <HI>Gol∣den Wedge of Ophir;</HI> Every Word is a <HI>Pearl,</HI> and has a sense and worth in it, that is Invaluable. The Psalms of <HI>David</HI> were Sung in <HI>Jehoshaphats</HI> time, as well as in <HI>Solomon's,</HI> and in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> time, we read, <HI>He commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord, with the Words of David and of Asaph.</HI> Words of an Excellency and an Efficacy, which are not found but where the <HI>Spirit of the Lord speaks by</HI> Men, and <HI>His Word is in their Tongue.</HI> Yea, Even the <HI>Song of the Lamb,</HI> in the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> seems to be fetched out of our <HI>Eighty sixth</HI> Psalm; and the Song of the <HI>Angels</HI> in the <HI>second</HI> of <HI>Luke</HI> seems to be fetched out of our <HI>Eighty fifth.</HI> And our Blessed SAVIOUR Him∣self, a <HI>Greater than David,</HI> and his Antitype, no doubt, at the Passover, as often as it recurred, Sung at least part of what they called, <HI>The Great Hallel,</HI> which was the <HI>Hundred and thirteenth</HI> Psalm, with the Five that followed it. In a word, we are so directed, Eph. V. 19 <HI>Speak to your selves in Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.</HI> In this Direction, there appears an evident Reference, unto the Distinction of the Poems in our <HI>Hebrew Psalter.</HI> The Poems there are distinguished by Three Terms, exactly answering unto <HI>These.</HI> It seems to be said, <HI>Let your Psalter supply you with the Songs, wherein the Admonitions of Piety are to be received, and preserved, and applied among you!</HI></P>
<P>IT would follow from hence, that such a <HI>Version</HI> of the PSALMS, as keeps most <HI>Close to the Original,</HI> were most of all to be wished for. Of about Three Times seven Translations of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> which we have seen fitted for the Tunes of our <HI>Sacred Songs</HI> there is not one, but what for the sake of a needless <HI>Rhyme,</HI> does <HI>Leave out</HI> very much of what the Holy SPIRIT has inserted in the <HI>Original,</HI> and <HI>put in</HI> as much of what is not <HI>there</HI> to be met withal. Of these Translations, there are some <HI>Nearer</HI> to the <HI>Original</HI> than others, and have more of <HI>That</HI> in it, with least of Di∣version
<PB N="8" REF="002241_0013_0FDAD6A61E5C5AA8"/>from it, or Addition to it: And the <HI>Nearest</HI> are certainly the most worthy to have our Medita∣tions employed upon them. After all, of what Con∣sequence is (the <HI>Similis Definentia</HI> of) <HI>Rhyme,</HI> to our <HI>Psalmody,</HI> when even to <HI>Poetry</HI> it self, it is not Essential? The <HI>Psalms</HI> might easily be so turned into <HI>Blank Verse,</HI> that there should be ALL, and ONLY, what it has pleased the Holy One to give us in the <HI>Original.</HI> And no doubt there will a Time come, when Myriads of Christians will chuse to Serve GOD with such a <HI>Pure Offering,</HI> and present unto Him what is <HI>purely His own,</HI> rather than have their Devotions in Danger of being palled, by the sense of <HI>Humane De∣basements,</HI> upon what they Address unto Him. An Honourable Counsellor in the Low-Countries, Mynheer <HI>Bruyne,</HI> published in Dutch, the PSALMS in such <HI>Blank Verse.</HI> But because his Translation differed, as it must, from what was in the <HI>Common Bible,</HI> another who was a Master of Musick, fitted a variety of Tunes to the Psalter, without changing a word in the <HI>Com∣mon Bible.</HI> However the Tunes were so various, and the necessary Repetition of the same Word so frequent, that this did not much mend the matter. Some will think it a pity that the Design of the Excellent <HI>Bruyne,</HI> should not proceed, as the Great <HI>Voetius</HI> expresses it, <HI>Abs{que} aliqua Commotione ple<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Ecclesiasticae.</HI> Or, without some <HI>Discord</HI> among the People.</P>
<P>§ 5. IN the Provision which our <HI>Psalter</HI> has made of <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> for us, we find all the Intentions of PIETY, how admirably provided for!</P>
<P>WOULD we be well Instructed in the <HI>Mysteries</HI> which belong to the Kingdom of GOD, or well ac∣quainted with the <HI>Prophecies</HI> that refer to the Delay or the Coming of the Kingdom? In our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> we shall find our selves <HI>Taught of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> of our GOD is to be implored, how pathetically, how effectually may we with the cries of our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> pierce the Hea∣vens,
<PB N="9" REF="002241_0014_0FDAC942D63B8358"/>till our Hearts are melted with some Assurance of our Pardon?</P>
<P>WHEN we are <HI>Panting</HI> after the Dispositions of a <HI>Sanctified Soul, as the Hart after the Water-Brooks,</HI> our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> will be found, how <HI>sanctifying</HI> ones; and how likely to bring us into the very <HI>Feeling</HI> of what we are <HI>Asking</HI> for?</P>
<P>WHEN we are <HI>Afflicted very much,</HI> be the occasions what they will, what <HI>Consolations of GOD,</HI> which are <HI>not small,</HI> may we find in our <HI>Spiritual Songs,</HI> which GOD <HI>our Maker has given us for the Night,</HI> of those Dark Hours, which our Afflictions may bring upon us?</P>
<P>WOULD we know our <HI>Duty</HI> in every condition? Our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> will soon bring us to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of it, yea, spur us to the <HI>Practice</HI> of it.</P>
<P>WHAT point of our <HI>spiritual,</HI> or even our <HI>Tempo∣ral Prosperity,</HI> is there, that in the Language of our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> we may not Petition for; and with a <HI>Faith</HI> so exercised therein, that we shall have the grant of our Petition?</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Temptations</HI> we are assaulted withal, the Harp of <HI>David</HI> being with our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> well play'd upon, the <HI>Tempter</HI> will ere long depart; <HI>Ser∣pents</HI> will burst and break upon the <HI>Singing</HI> of such <HI>Verses</HI> as these.</P>
<P>WE may have <HI>Adversaries,</HI> of whose Influences to hurt us, we may have some Terror upon us. By our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> we fly away to a <HI>Munition of Rocks.</HI> There was a Time, when the <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD had like to have been overwhelmed with <HI>Adversaries;</HI> but <HI>when the Singers began to Sing,</HI> the Providence of GOD with strange Dispensations defeated them. Only, when <HI>Imprecations upon Enemies</HI> occur in our <HI>Psalms,</HI> let us never dart any of them against any of our Neigh∣bours; be they never so malevolent, never so injuri∣ous When we Sing, <HI>Upon mine Enemies my Eyes their Wish shall see.</HI> Let it be remembred, <HI>Their Wish</HI> is not
<PB N="10" REF="002241_0015_0FDAD6A79A8E1498"/>in the Original. Thy <HI>Word of supply,</HI> O charitable Christian will rather be, <HI>What comes:</HI> For thou will <HI>Wish</HI> for them nothing but Good. The <HI>Imprecations</HI> may indeed be hurled against <HI>Publick Enemies,</HI> and those without whose Confusion the People of GOD cannot be in safety. But rather, Let the <HI>Singer</HI> make his <HI>Interiour Adversaries,</HI> the Objects of all these <HI>Impre∣precations.</HI> And as in the Primitive Times, the <HI>Devils</HI> in Energumens discovered a singular Horror, at the Singing of that Verse, <HI>May GOD arise; His Enemies, may they be scattered; and such as are Haters of Him, fly from before His Face:</HI> Thus, O Singer, Let <HI>Satan</HI> be the <HI>Enemy</HI> against whom thou wilt <HI>sing the Songs of the Lord.</HI> And let thy <HI>Original sin,</HI> be the <HI>Enemy</HI> in like manner stab'd by those <HI>Javelins</HI> of the <HI>Divine Armoury,</HI> and let thy <HI>Lusts</HI> be those <HI>Foes,</HI> against which thou wilt with thy <HI>Songs</HI> as with <HI>slings</HI> cast forth what shall mortify them? One of the <HI>Arnobius's</HI> has very particularly informed us, how the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> did with such an Application of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> carry on, <HI>The Wars of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, What shall be said? Surely, By our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> we may now after some sort begin <HI>Hea∣ven upon Earth.</HI> It was very justly said by <HI>Chrysostom</HI> unto the Devout Singer,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Thou art in a Consort with the Angels of Heaven, in what thou art now a doing.</HI> For which cause, as the <HI>Devils</HI> undergo a peculiar vexation from our <HI>spiritual Songs;</HI> None of our Devotions more Odious or more Tedious to them; So the <HI>Angels</HI> take a more singular and special Delight in doing of Good Offices for those who by <HI>spiritual songs</HI> are much associated with them; always on the <HI>Wing</HI> to be their Guardians. And Oh! how much of <HI>Heaven</HI> have hundreds of thousands found coming down into their Souls, while they have attempted thus to come into a Consort with the <HI>Angels</HI> there! Souls no strangers to the Ex∣perience of what <HI>Austin</HI> reports of himself. <HI>Quantum

All that <HI>Bafil</HI> has written in his First Homily on the <HI>Psalms;</HI> All that <HI>Chrysostom</HI> in his Twenty-eighth Ho∣mily on the <HI>Romans;</HI> All that <HI>Athanasius</HI> in his whole Epistle to <HI>Marcellinus,</HI> in commendation of this <HI>Hea∣venly Exercise,</HI> 'tis all too little; all short of the Merit of the Cause. <HI>'Tis a good thing to celebrate with praise, the Eternal GOD; and to sing praise unto thy Name, O Thou that art most High.</HI> How <HI>Good!</HI> It is beyond what any <HI>Tongue</HI> may utter, or any <HI>Heart</HI> conceive.</P>
<P>§ 6. BUT it is a CASE which very much wants to be considered, <HI>How shall our spiritual Songs come to be so sung, that they may have their Glorious Intentions an∣swered?</HI> It is Required of us; Eph. V. 19. <HI>Singing and making Melody in your Hearts unto the Lord.</HI> And, Col. III. 16. <HI>Singing with Grace in your Hearts unto the Lord.</HI> Be sure, 'Tis not a meer <HI>Noise</HI> in the <HI>Throat,</HI> that will be a <HI>Singing</HI> acceptable unto GOD; No, Tho' it be never so finely, artifically, regularly ma∣naged, yet the <HI>Singing</HI> may be but an <HI>Howling,</HI> before His Holy Majesty.

</LG>
<P>MOST certainly, <HI>Grace</HI> at Work in the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Singer,</HI> will <HI>make Melody in the Heart unto the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Bodily Exercise</HI> without it, will <HI>Profit but a little.</HI> We Sing to little Purpose, if we cannot say, <HI>O thou Eternal GOD, I do lift up my Soul to thee;</HI> And, <HI>My Heart is well prepared, O GOD; my Heart is well prepared.</HI> But, how shall this be attained unto?</P>

<P>BUT let this be one of the First Things prescri∣bed. Study and Labour for such Impressions of PIE∣TY on our Minds, as we may easily discover to have been upon the Minds of the <HI>Inspired Writers,</HI> at the Time when they wrote the <HI>spiritual Songs,</HI> which we are now <HI>Singing unto the Lord.</HI> An Exultation of PIE∣TY in <HI>Singing unto GOD,</HI> has an Infinite Recommen∣dation of it, from This; That the <HI>Prophetic</HI> SPIRIT, falling according to the Good Pleasure of GOD, upon the Children of Men, and His <HI>Good Angels possessing</HI> of them, one of the <HI>Gifts</HI> with which they were en∣dowed, and one of the <HI>Acts</HI> to which they were exci∣ted, was that of <HI>Singing unto GOD.</HI> They could not but break forth into <HI>songs,</HI> wherein the <HI>Great Things of GOD</HI> were celebrated: <HI>When they came together, every one</HI> (whom Heaven Inspired for it) <HI>had a Psalus.</HI> Those <HI>Extraordinary Operations</HI> have been witheld from the Church, during the <HI>Three Years and an half</HI> (that is to say, Twelve hundred and sixty) wherein it <HI>must not Rain.</HI> And whether they will be revived, when that Period shall be Expired, and there will be a <HI>sound of abundance of Rain,</HI> 'tis known only to our <HI>Ascended Lord,</HI> who has the bestowing of them. In the mean time, <HI>This</HI> is what we have to do, that according to <HI>the Dispensation of the Day,</HI> we may <HI>Sing with the Spirit, and Sing also with Understanding.</HI> The Writers of our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> were <HI>Holy Men of GOD;</HI> and had a
<PB N="13" REF="002241_0018_0FDAD6BFEFB18C88"/>Principle of PIETY Sanctifying of them. There can be no doubt of it, but that when the Holy SPI∣RIT with His Afflations, disposed them to write what we have in our Hands, He produced in their <HI>Hearts</HI> those <HI>Motions of Piety,</HI> which were agreeable and answerable to the <HI>Matter</HI> then flowing from their <HI>Pens.</HI> In what they have written, there is very Le∣gible, and a very ordinary Capacity may see, A <HI>Con∣fession</HI> of Holy Truths, with an Heart <HI>Believing</HI> of them, <HI>Consenting</HI> to them; A <HI>Desire</HI> of Promised Blessings, with a <HI>Value</HI> for them; a <HI>Love</HI> to GOD, (and Man;) and a <HI>Zeal</HI> for His Kingdom; and His <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Or∣dinances;</HI> a <HI>Faith</HI> in GOD, and our SAVIOUR, and His Promises; with a Joy in Him; and a Rapturous <HI>Admiration</HI> of Him; An <HI>horror of sin,</HI> and a <HI>sorrow</HI> for it; and a <HI>Fear</HI> of the <HI>Judgments</HI> threatned unto it; a <HI>Resolution</HI> for the Service of GOD; and a Retreat unto Him: with a Despair to find Re∣lief in Creatures; with other <HI>Motions of Piety,</HI> which belong to the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> in the Soul. In Singing our <HI>spiritual Songs,</HI> let us be Inquisitive after those <HI>Motions of Piety,</HI> which are discernible in the Verse now before us; and let us with a Soul flying away to GOD, <HI>for</HI> them, try whether we cannot fly <HI>with</HI> them; and strive to come at <HI>the like;</HI> and give not over the struggle, till we feel our selves come into an Holy <HI>Symphony</HI> with the Saints who had their <HI>Hearts burning</HI> within them, when they <HI>Sang</HI> these things unto the Lord. <HI>Christian,</HI> Behold a lovely Me∣thod of getting into those Heavenly <HI>Frames</HI> &amp; <HI>strains</HI> which will assure thee of thy arriving one Day, to the same state of Blessedness, and those <HI>Everlasting Habita∣tions,</HI> which these <HI>Favourites</HI> and <HI>Amanuenses</HI> of Hea∣ven, thro' whom our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> were convey'd unto us, have been renew'd into. Yea, Thou art already <HI>Caught up to Paradise</HI> in them. Nor is there a Nobler Method, among all our <HI>Hermeneutic Instru∣ments,</HI> to come at the <HI>True sense</HI> of our <HI>spiritual Songs,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="002241_0019_0FDAD6AAB76CEB48"/>than <HI>Affectum scriptorum Sacrorum Observare, Eumque assumere,</HI> as Dr. <HI>spener</HI> advises, or an <HI>Experimental Taste,</HI> of the PIETY which was working in the Hearts of the Writers at the Time of their Inspiration. Even an <HI>Illiterate Christian,</HI> that <HI>Lives unto GOD,</HI> and is no Stranger to the <HI>Sentiments of Piety,</HI> may in that way reach the <HI>True sense</HI> of the <HI>Lively Oracles,</HI> and (a <HI>Luther,</HI> a <HI>Gerhard,</HI> a <HI>Franckius,</HI> and all the Sons of the Orthodox and Genuine <HI>Pietism</HI> will tell us) he will have <HI>within him,</HI> an Exposition far more Valuable, than any of the <HI>Commentators,</HI> (truly <HI>Com∣mentators!</HI>) who are <HI>Alienated from the Life of GOD,</HI> can help him to.</P>
<P>WE read, Rev. XIV. 3. Of, A <HI>song which no man could Learn, but they which were Redeemed from the Earth.</HI> We have now described a <HI>Way of Singing,</HI> which <HI>none can Learn, but such as GOD Redeems from the Earth.</HI> And, O <HI>Earthly-minded Man,</HI> If upon a Trial for it, thou find thy self Enabled unto this <HI>Way of Singing,</HI> This will fetch thee, and raise thee up from the <HI>Earth</HI> in which thy Soul has been buried; It will be a <HI>Token for Good</HI> upon thee, <HI>GOD has Redeemed thee from the Earth;</HI> and the <HI>Heaven</HI> which thou art Anticipating shall be thy Portion.</P>
<P>§. 7. AS in the <HI>Reading</HI> of the <HI>sacred Scriptures</HI> in general, so particularly for the <HI>Singing</HI> of our <HI>Spiritual Songs,</HI> (by all of which we are to be <HI>Ad∣monished</HI>) the <HI>Porismatic</HI> way is a very Notable One, to pay our Homage unto our GOD. That is, To fetch LESSONS out of every <HI>Verse,</HI> and then turn them into PRAYERS; to form a <HI>Note</HI> and a <HI>Wish</HI> upon every <HI>Clause</HI> before us: For which the <HI>Time of Dilatation</HI> which we take in our <HI>Singing</HI> affords usually a sufficient Opportunity. While we do by the Action of <HI>Singing,</HI> put our Minds into
<PB N="15" REF="002241_0020_0FDAD6C521A69408"/>a due Posture for it. We should first <HI>Hear</HI> what the Glorious GOD <HI>speaks</HI> unto us, and then with fit <HI>Echo's of Devotion</HI> give our <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Answer</HI> unto it; and perform what the Psalmist so Exemplified: <HI>seek ye my Face;</HI> On hearing this, <HI>My Heart did speak to thee; Thy Face, O thou Eternal GOD,</HI> Thy Face now <HI>will I will seek.</HI> An <HI>Alternation,</HI> preferrible to those <HI>Antiphona's,</HI> which are now generally dropt in the most Reformed Churches. To do This, re∣quires a Skilful and Intense <HI>Thinking,</HI> 'tis true; It is requisite that our Faculties be roused for it, with an, <HI>O my</HI> awakned <HI>Soul, Do thou Bless the Eternal GOD; and all my Inward Powers the Name of His pure Holiness.</HI> But what we are now doing <HI>before the Ark,</HI> ought always to be done <HI>with all our might.</HI> And such is the <HI>Pleasure</HI> as well as the <HI>profit,</HI> of Conversing with the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD, in this way of Proceeding, that those who are used unto it, will give Thanks to a Gracious GOD for Instructing them in this way of coming at all <HI>Precious and Pleasant Riches,</HI> more than if all the <HI>Vain Riches</HI> of this World had been thrown in upon them; They <HI>Rejoice</HI> in this <HI>Way</HI> of Living on the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of GOD, <HI>as much as in all Riches.</HI> And the treating of our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> in such a manner, does not only Satisfy the Good Men, who might else complain of the <HI>Jewish Dress,</HI> which appears upon many of them, and propose to see <HI>David</HI> stript of his <HI>Harp,</HI> and all his Musical Instruments; a <HI>Psalter</HI> without any Air of the Old Testament in it: — Syrs, The <HI>Things</HI> and the <HI>Terms</HI> Originally pertaining to the Church of <HI>Israel</HI> will do <HI>us</HI> no Damage; There is a Sweet <HI>Gospel</HI> in them, if we give Attention to it; Yea, we lose too much of the Beauty to be discovered in our <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> if we lay them wholly aside! — Is there not a <HI>Zion</HI> of the Gospel, which you are well-acquainted withal? May not the <HI>Ark</HI> of GOD lead you to His CHRIST? The <HI>House</HI> of GOD, and the Courts thereof lead you into His <HI>Church;</HI> and into its <HI>As∣semblies</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002241_0021_0FDAD6AF2C1DCED8"/>here below, and into the <HI>Heavenly World</HI> above? The <HI>Sacrifices</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> lead you to a sacrificed JE∣SUS, and unto the Devotions and Benignities, which are the <HI>spiritual Sacrifices</HI> of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> acceptable to GOD, only thro' that <HI>Great Propitiation!</HI> The <HI>Mu∣sical Instruments</HI> be answered in an <HI>Heart</HI> that is to be a well-tuned <HI>Harp,</HI> and in the <HI>Opportunities</HI> and <HI>Advan∣tages</HI> to Glorify GOD, with which He has furnished you! But it also removes a weak Objection, which the <HI>Non-Singers</HI> make against our uttering the Language of those who had the Holy SPIRIT of GOD filling of them. It has been weakly cavilled by some Secta∣ries, that it would be <HI>Nonsense</HI> or <HI>Falsehood,</HI> in many Persons, to speak the Words of <HI>David</HI> after him. The <HI>End</HI> of our <HI>Psalmody</HI> is not considered by these Cavil∣lers. It may be, O Man, thou canst not say, <HI>I have set the Eternal GOD before me evermore.</HI> But upon <HI>Sing∣ing</HI> of this, thou mayst make that <HI>Observation, That it is a great mark of and help to a godly Man, to have the Great GOD always in his View.</HI> And thou canst send up this <HI>Ejaculation</HI> to Heaven upon it; <HI>My GOD, Let me hive my Eye upon thee contimually.</HI> Thou canst not say, <HI>O thou Eternal GOD, my heart it is not haughty grown.</HI> But upon <HI>Singing</HI> of this, thou mayst make that <HI>Observation, An humble Heart will be the Companion and the Discovery of a Godly Mind.</HI> And thou canst send up this <HI>Ejacula∣tion</HI> to Heaven upon it; <HI>My GOD, cloath me with Humility.</HI> The CXIX Psalm will have in it <HI>Affections</HI> and <HI>Attainments</HI> which thou canst not pretend unto: But it will <HI>Inform</HI> thee of what thou shouldest <HI>Aspire</HI> unto, and should be Sung with <HI>Aspirations.</HI> Thus, <HI>Dicas attente, Dic totum Supplice mente.</HI></P>
<P>§ 8. <HI>SEARCH the Scriptures, for they testify of me,</HI> saith our SAVIOUR. When we are <HI>Digging</HI> in these deep &amp; vast <HI>Mines</HI> of Truth, it won't be long before the <HI>Pearl of great Price</HI> will occur unto us. To <HI>Sing</HI> PSALMS is a Duty not only <HI>Commended</HI> but also <HI>Commanded</HI> unto
<PB N="17" REF="002241_0022_0FDAD6C650A100F8"/>us, in the Example which our SAVIOUR has given us of it, saying, <HI>Do as I have done.</HI> 'Tis what we find our Blessed JESUS us'd unto; and one <HI>Time</HI> above the rest, we Read, Mat. 26. 30. <HI>He Sung an Hymn.</HI> And Oh! what a <HI>Time</HI> was it? It was the <HI>Night</HI> before His <HI>Crucifixion!</HI> It was at the <HI>Time</HI> when He was just going to Encounter Things tremendous, beyond all Imagination: Sufferings and Anguishes that were to make Expiation for the <HI>Iniquities of us all,</HI> which GOD laid upon Him. At <HI>such a Time!</HI> one would have thought, that <HI>Now,</HI> if ever, <HI>Singing</HI> had been unseasonable, unpracticable. Yet Now, we hear Him <HI>Singing</HI> to His Father. When we are <HI>Tuning our Hearts</HI> for a <HI>Song</HI> of GOD, how much may it ani∣mate us to think, <HI>I am going to Imitate my Admirable SAVIOUR!</HI> But, O thou <HI>Follower of the Good One,</HI> what a further Animation of thy <HI>spiritual Songs,</HI> may it be to think, That in Him who is thy <HI>Pattern</HI> for them, thou hast also the <HI>Matter</HI> of them! 'Tis of thy SAVIOUR; they are on that Score, <HI>The Songs of the Lamb,</HI> that thou art now to <HI>Sing</HI> unto Him. There having been promised, at the beginning, <HI>One to be born of a Woman, by whom the Grand Enemy of Mankind should be destroyed, and Mankind be delivered from the Miseries which our Fall from GOD has brought upon us:</HI> Upon the the Faith of this <HI>Promised REDEEMER</HI> our whole <HI>Bible</HI> turns, more than any one thing in the World; and this <HI>Faith,</HI> more than any one thing in the World, explains numberless Passages in this <HI>Book of the MES∣SIAH</HI> where many <HI>Great Things,</HI> would else appear <HI>strange Things</HI> unto us. The People of GOD in the elder Times, had a stronger Idea of the <HI>First Promise</HI> than is commonly imagined in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; their Thoughts, their Hopes, their Aims, ran very much on the <HI>Promised Re∣deemer;</HI> And the Holy SPIRIT of GOD gratified them with various and growing Discoveries of Him. <HI>David</HI> saw more of the <HI>Promised Redeemer</HI> than any that had gone before him; who yet <HI>saw His Day, and
<PB N="18" REF="002241_0023_0FDAD6B09FBB2758"/>were glad.</HI> Yes, as <HI>David</HI> passed thro' many Circum∣stances which were <HI>Typical</HI> of the <HI>Promised Redeemer,</HI> so the Holy SPIRIT of GOD inclined him to write many things, in which the Circumstances of the <HI>Promised Re∣deemer</HI> were much more exhibited than his own. <HI>Christian,</HI> In thy <HI>spiritual Songs,</HI> which are <HI>Fat things full of Marrow,</HI> be still Inquisitive, <HI>What is there of a Glorious CHRIST, which I am now led unto the Contemplation of?</HI> Getting a Taste of <HI>That,</HI> thou hast the very <HI>Marrow</HI> of them. Not only the II, the VI, the VIII, the XVI, the XVIII, the XXII, the XXXIV, the XXXV, the XXXVIII, the XL, the XLI, the XLV, the XLVII, the L, the LV, the LVI, the LVII, the LXI, the LXIII, the LXVI, the LXVIII, the LXIX, the LXXI, the LXXII, the LXXV, the LXXXV, the LXXXVI, the LXXXVIII, the LXXXIX, the XCI, the XCVI, the XCVII, the XCVIII, the CI, the CIX, the CX, the CXVI, the CXVIII, the CXXXII, the CXXXIX, the CXL, the CXLI, the CXLII, the CXLIII, the CXLV, the CXLIX <HI>Psalms,</HI> have a CHRIST sensibly filling of them; a CHRIST <HI>Evidently in them, set before our Eyes:</HI> But a <HI>Folengius</HI> was right in saying, <HI>Totius Vo∣luminis Psalmorum Argumentum CHRISTUS;</HI> A Glorious CHRIST is the Sum and Soul of them all; The Per∣son, the <HI>Natures,</HI> the <HI>Vertues,</HI> the <HI>Humiliation,</HI> the <HI>Ex∣altation,</HI> the Extensive <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and the Admirable Glories of our SAVIOUR, are in the <HI>Psalms,</HI> every where sparkling, like the <HI>Stones of Fire,</HI> with which the Rock is brightned. It has been the Conjecture of some Learned Men, that some of the <HI>Songs</HI> among the Ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> did in reality celebrate the At∣chievements of <HI>Joshua,</HI> with Traditions which <HI>Cadmus</HI> the <HI>Pluenician,</HI> left among them. 'Tis very sure, That our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> do every where celebrate the Per∣fections and the Performances of our wonderful JE∣SUS; and when we find HIM in them, we have then found the very <HI>Kernel</HI> of them: We are then Fed with the <HI>Finest of the Wheat, and satisfied with Honey
<PB N="19" REF="002241_0024_0FDAD6C7F57D6BA0"/>out of the Rock.</HI> O Believer, <HI>Sing</HI> the <HI>Graces,</HI> the <HI>Acti∣ons,</HI> the <HI>Sufferings</HI> and the <HI>Grandeurs</HI> of thy Incomparable SAVIOUR; Yea, get as far as thou canst into the Sentiments, that may somewhat resemble those, which the <HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> here assigns unto thy SAVIOUR, in the Time of His <HI>Working out thy Salvation</HI> for thee; And then, become able, with an Holy Triumph of Soul, to say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I Love thee; and that I love to Sing thy Praises.</HI> The CHRIST in thy PSALMS, may be called <HI>The Key of David,</HI> which lets thee into inestimable <HI>Treasures,</HI> and indeed shows the Things, which the <HI>Angels desire to look into.</HI> Yea, In feeding on this <HI>Man∣na,</HI> thou dost <HI>Eat the Food of Angels!</HI></P>
<P>§ 9. TO give a finishing stroke, unto the Directi∣ons, <HI>How to Sing the songs of the Lord, in the Land of a Stranger?</HI> Here shall be transcribed a Paragraph of an Introduction, to a well-known Edition of the <HI>Psal∣ter</HI> in <HI>Blank Verse,</HI> with <HI>Illustrations</HI> upon it.</P>
<Q><P>THERE is a wonderful Thing to be observed concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much over look'd, by all the <HI>Uninspired Interpre∣ters;</HI> But it is a Thing, which our SAVIOUR, and His Apostles, who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty times, have led us into the Apprehension of. This is, That they are full of <HI>Prophecies;</HI> and our <HI>Psalter</HI> is indeed the most <HI>Prophetical Book</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <HI>Astonishments!</HI> — to be observed, That the Design of the <HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> in the <HI>Psalms</HI> all along, has been to describe the Sufferings of the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> and of the <HI>Christian Surrogate,</HI> under the Tyranny of <HI>Antichrist;</HI> and foretel the Characters and Confusions of that <HI>Wicked one,</HI> and of his Followers; and Pre∣dict the Recovery of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> from their
<PB N="20" REF="002241_0025_0FDAD6B224841560"/>long Dispersions; and a long Felicity for them, and the <HI>Converted Gentiles</HI> associated with them, under the succeeding Reign of the MESSIAH; and the Happy State of the <HI>New Earth,</HI> in which, under the Influen∣ces of the <HI>New Heaven,</HI> there shall <HI>Dwell Righteousness,</HI> and the <HI>Tabernacle of GOD, shall be with Men,</HI> and <HI>He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His People, and GOD Himself shall be with them, and be their GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be the Word which we render, <HI>To the Chief Musician,</HI> but which may be rendred (and was of old so,) <HI>For the End,</HI> may be to intimate, that the <HI>Psalms</HI> are calculated eminently with an Eye to the Things that are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <HI>The time of the End.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Jerom</HI> long ago found <HI>Antichrist</HI> in the <HI>Psalms:</HI> And <HI>Austin</HI> affirmed, That the <HI>Psalms</HI> ought all to be understood of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <HI>After∣Ages.</HI> But we now Improve in our Discoveries.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, The <HI>Devout Singer</HI> like the <HI>Be∣loved Disciple,</HI> shall <HI>be carried away in the Spirit into the Wilderness,</HI> and be shown the <HI>Judgment of the Great Whore, that sitteth upon many Waters.</HI> He shall also in these Visions of GOD, <HI>See the Holy City, New Jerusa∣lem, coming down from GOD out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride for her Husband.</HI> Very depraved must be that Soul, that has not, a Relish for such Contem∣plations, more than for any Earthly Entertainments; and that will not heartily say, <HI>They're more desireable than Gold, yea, than much solid Gold; than Honey also sweeter much, or dropping Honey-Comb.</HI></P></Q>

The Hand∣maids of the Lord, forget <HI>Miriam,</HI> and <HI>All the Women that went out after her,</HI> if they decline their part in <HI>Singing</HI> the Praises of GOD; since diverse of our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> were composed by Persons of the <HI>Female Sex,</HI> 'tis but Reasonable that the <HI>Female Sex</HI> bear their part in <HI>Singing</HI> of these, and all the rest. A <HI>Gorgenia</HI> the Renowned Sister of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> is commemorated for it. And as no <HI>Persons</HI> are to be exempted, so no <HI>Places</HI> are to be excluded from the <HI>Reasonable Service;</HI> but we are to <HI>Sing every where, Lifting up an Holy Voice,</HI> unto the Lord. Not only should we <HI>with all our Heart Praise the Eternal GOD, where the Upright meet Privately, and where more Publickly;</HI> But also the <HI>Christian Hous∣holder</HI> should make this one of his <HI>Family-Sacrifices.</HI> Yea, how comfortably may the <HI>Family</HI> go to Rest, when the last Verse of the <HI>Fourth Psalm</HI> has concluded all? This truly is one of the Excellent Methods, wherein the <HI>Word of CHRIST</HI> is to <HI>Dwell Richly</HI> with us, and be a constant and welcome Lodger in our <HI>Dwellings.</HI> Yea, <HI>Theodoret</HI> reports, That the Faithful in the Pri∣mitive Times, had the <HI>Psalms</HI> by heart, so that they would Recreate themselves with <HI>Singing</HI> them in the <HI>Streets</HI> and in the <HI>Fields,</HI> as well as in their <HI>Dwellings.</HI> A <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> turn a <HI>Dungeon</HI> into a <HI>Palace,</HI> by <HI>Singing</HI> there. One says, <HI>The Earth Danced unto their Musick.</HI></P>
<P>IT is Remarkable, That when the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of GOD has been making any <HI>New Appearance,</HI> a mighty Zeal for the <HI>Singing</HI> of PSALMS, has attended it, and as∣sisted it. And may we see our People grow more <HI>Zealous</HI> of this <HI>Good Work,</HI> what an hopeful <HI>Sign of the Times</HI> would be seen in it, That <HI>the Time of Singing is
<PB N="22" REF="002241_0027_0FDAD6B409DBF4D0"/>come, and the Voice of the Turtle is to be heard in the Land?</HI></P>
<P>BUT in the pursuance of this Holy Intention, it would be very desirable, that people, (and especially our YOUNG PEOPLE, who are most in the Years of Discipline,) would more generally <HI>Learn to SING</HI> and become able to Sing by RULE, and keep to the NOTES of the TUNES, which our <HI>spiritual Songs</HI> are set unto; which would be to <HI>Sing,</HI> as <HI>Origen</HI> expresses it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>Agreeably</HI> and <HI>Me∣ledionsly.</HI> In Early Days a famous Council condemned it; in that there were <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Disorderly Clamours,</HI> with which the <HI>Psalmody</HI> was then sometimes disturbed. In later Days, <HI>Cassander</HI> upbraided it, <HI>Ad feritatem quandum barbaricum composito sono, Boant, Latrant, mugi∣unt, frendunt, rudunt, et quidvis potius quam canunt. — Tarttaricos quosdam clamores Exprimunt.</HI> In plain English, They <HI>made sad and wild Work on't.</HI> It has been found accordingly in some of our Congregations, that in length of Time, their <HI>Singing</HI> has degenerated, into an <HI>Odd Noise,</HI> that has had more of what we want a Name for, than any <HI>Regular Singing</HI> in it; whereby the <HI>Celestial Exercise</HI> is dishonoured; and indeed the <HI>Third Com∣mandment</HI> is trespass'd on. To take notice of the <HI>Ridiculous Pleas,</HI> wherewith some very weak People, go to confirm this Degeneracy, would indeed be to pay too much Respect unto them. And they must have strange Notions of the Divine SPIRIT, and of His Operations, who shall imagine, that the Delight which their <HI>Untuned Ears</HI> take in an <HI>Uncouth Noise,</HI> more than in a <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is any <HI>Communion</HI> with Him. The Skill of <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is among the <HI>Gifts</HI> of GOD unto the Children of Men, and by no means unthankfully to be Neglected or Despised. For the Congregations, wherein 'tis wanting, to recover a <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> would be really a <HI>Reformation,</HI> and a Recovery out of an <HI>Apostacy,</HI> and what we may judge that Heaven would be pleased withal. We ought
<PB N="23" REF="002241_0028_0FDAD6CE23F231B8"/>certainly to Serve our GOD with our <HI>Best,</HI> and <HI>Re∣gular Singing</HI> must needs be <HI>Better</HI> than the confused Noise of a Wilderness. <HI>GOD is not for Confusion in the Churches of the Saints;</HI> but requires, <HI>Let all things be done decently.</HI> 'Tis a Great Mistake of some weak People, That the <HI>Tunes</HI> regulated with the <HI>Notes</HI> used in the <HI>Regular Singing</HI> of our Churches are the same that are used in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And what if they were? Our <HI>Psalms</HI> too are used there. But the <HI>Tunes</HI> used in the <HI>French Psalmody,</HI> and from Them in the <HI>Dutch</HI> also, were set by a famous Martyr of JESUS CHRIST; And when <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI> illuminated <HI>England,</HI> with their Version of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> the <HI>Tunes</HI> have been set by such as a Good Protestant may be willing to hold Commu∣nion withal. The <HI>Tunes</HI> commonly used in our Churches, are <HI>Few;</HI> T'were well if there were <HI>more.</HI> But they are also <HI>Grave,</HI> and such as well <HI>become the Oracles of GOD,</HI> and such as do Steer clear of the Two Shelves, which <HI>Austin</HI> was afraid of; when he did, <HI>In cantu Sacro strictuare, inter Periculum Voluptatis, et Experimentum Salubritatis;</HI> in danger of too much <HI>Delicacy</HI> on the one side, and <HI>Asperity</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Musick</HI> of the Ancient Hebrews, an Ad∣justment whereto seems to be all the <HI>Measure</HI> of their <HI>Poetry,</HI> (after all the Attempts of <HI>Gomarus,</HI> and other Learned Men otherwise to <HI>Measure</HI> it,) being utterly Lost; and as <HI>Aben. Exra</HI> observes, of the <HI>Musical Instruments</HI> in the <HI>Hundred and Fifteth Psalm,</HI> wholly It recoverable; we have no way Left us now, but with <HI>Tunes</HI> composed by the <HI>Chief Musicians</HI> for us, to <HI>do as well as we can.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002241_0029_0FDAD6B5111882B8"/>
IT is to be desired, that we may see in the Rising Generation, a fresh and Strong Disposition to <HI>Learn</HI> the proper <HI>Tunes;</HI> that GOD may be Glorified, and Religion beautified, with a <HI>Regular Singing</HI> among us; And that, <HI>To them that are His Servants, He may let His work be seen; His Glory also unto those that are their Children</HI> here: <HI>And that the Lovely Brightness of the Lord who is our GOD,</HI> may with Conspicuous Lustre be seen shining <HI>upon us.</HI></P>
