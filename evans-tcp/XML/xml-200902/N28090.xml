<HEAD>THE PREFACE BEING A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE DIVERS DISPENSATIONS OF GOD TO MEN, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD TO THAT OF OUR PRESENT AGE, BY THE MINISTRY AND TESTIMONY OF HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT GEORGE FOX, AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENSUING JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P>DIVERS have been the dispensations of God since the creation of the world, unto the sons of men; but the great end of all of them has been the renown of his own excellent name in the creation and restoration of man: man, the emblem of himself, as a god on earth, and the glory of all his works. The world began with innocency: all was then good that the good God had made: and as he blessed the works of his hands, so their natures and har∣mony magnified him their Creator. Then the morning stars sang together for joy, and all parts of his works said Amen to his law. Not a jarr in the whole frame, but man in paradise, the beasts in the field, the fowl in the air, the fish in the sea, the lights in the heavens, the fruits of the earth; yea the air, the earth, the water and fire worshipped, praised and exalted his power, wisdom and goodness. O holy sabbath, O holy day to the Lord!</P>
<P>But this happy state lasted not long: for man, the crown and glory of the whole, being tempted to aspire above his place, unhappily yielded against command and duty, as well as interest and felicity; and so fell below it, lost the divine image, the wisdom, power, and purity he was made in. By which, being no longer fit for paradise, he was ex∣pelled that garden of God, his proper dwelling and residence,
<PB N="iv" REF="037441_0003_100D8D63EA044960"/>and was driven out, as a poor vagabond, from the presence of the Lord, to wander in the earth, the habitation of beasts.</P>
<P>Yet God, that made him, had pity on him; for he seeing he was deceived, and that it was not of malice, or an original presumption in him, but through the subtilty of the serpent (that had first fallen from his own state, and by the mediation of the woman, man's own nature and companion, whom the serpent had first deluded) in his in∣finite goodness and wisdom found out a way to repair the breach, recover the loss, and restore fallen man again by a nobler and more excellent Adam, promised to be born of a woman; that as by means of a woman the evil one had prevailed upon man, by a woman also He should come into the world, who would prevail against him, and bruise his head, and deliver man from his power: and which, in a signal manner, by the dispensation of the Son of God in the flesh, in the fulness of time, was personally and fully accomplished by him, and in him, as man's Saviour and Redeemer.</P>
<P>But his power was not limited, in the manifestation of it, to that time; for both before and since his blessed mani∣festation in the flesh, he has been the light and life, the rock and strength of all that ever feared God: present with them in their temptations, followed them in their travels and af∣flictions, and supported and carried them through and over the difficulties that have attended them in their earthly pil∣grimage. By this, Abel's heart excelled Cain's, and Seth obtained the pre-eminence, and Enoch walked with God. It was this that strove with the old world, and which they rebelled against, and which sanctified and instructed Noah to Salvation.</P>
<P>But the outward dispensation that followed the benighted state of man, after his fall, especially among the patriarchs, was generally that of angels; as the scriptures of the Old Testament do in many places express, as to Abraham, Ja∣cob, &amp;c. The next was that of the law by Moses, which was also delivered by angels, as the apostle tells us. This dispensation was much outward, and suited to a low and servile state; called therefore that of a schoolmaster, to point out and prepare that people to look and long for the Messiah, who would deliver them from the servitude of a ceremonious and imperfect dispensation, by knowing the realities of those mysterious representations in themselves. In this time the law was written on stone, the temple built with hands, at∣tended
<PB N="v" REF="037441_0004_100D8D65E618A3C8"/>with an outward priesthood and external rites and ceremonies, that were shadows of the good things that were to come, and were only to serve till the Seed came, or the more excellent and general manifestation of Christ, to whom was the promise, and to all men only in him, in whom it was Yea and Amen; even life from death, immortality and eternal life.</P>
<P>This the prophets foresaw, and comforted the believing Jews in the certainty of it; which was the top of the Mo∣saical dispensation, and which ended in John's ministry, the forerunner of the Messiah, as John's was finished in him, the fulness of all. And God, that at sundry times and in divers manners had spoken to the fathers by his servants the prophets, spake then by his Son Christ Jesus, <Q>who is heir of all things;</Q> being the gospel-day, which is the dispensation of sonship: bringing in thereby a nearer testa∣ment, and a better hope, even the beginning of the glory of the latter days, and of the restitution of all things; yea, the restoration of the kingdom unto Israel.</P>
<P>Now the Spirit, that was more sparingly communicated in former dispensations, began to be <Q>poured forth upon all flesh,</Q> according to the prophet Joel, and the light that shined in darkness, or but dimly before, the most gra∣cious God caused to shine out of darkness, and the day-star began to arise in the hearts of believers, giving unto them the knowledge of God in the face (or appearance) of his Son Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Now the poor in spirit, the meek, the true mourners, the hungry and thirsty after righteousness, the peace-makers, the pure in heart, the merciful and the persecuted, came more especially in remembrance before the Lord, and were sought out and blessed by Israel's true Shepherd. Old Jerusalem with her children grew out of date, and the new Jerusalem into request, the mother of the sons of the gospel-day. Wherefore no more at old Jerusalem, nor at the mountain of Samaria, will God be worshipped above other places; for, behold, he is declared and preached a Spirit, and he will be known as such, and worshipped in the Spirit and in the Truth. He will come nearer than of old time, and he will write his law in the heart, and put his fear and Spi∣rit in the inward parts, according to his promise. Then signs, types, and shadows flew away, the day having disco∣vered their insufficiency in not reaching to the inside of the cup, to the cleansing of the conscience; and all element∣ary
<PB N="vi" REF="037441_0005_100D8D67B3D71E40"/>services were expired in and by him that is the sub∣stance of all.</P>
<P>And to this great and blessed end of the dispensation of the Son of God, did the apostles testify, whom he had cho∣sen and anointed by his Spirit, to turn the Jews from their prejudice and superstition, and the Gentiles from their vanity and idolatry, to Christ's Light and Spirit that shined in them; that they might be quickened from the sins and tres∣passes in which they were dead, to serve the Living God in the newness of the Spirit of Life, and walk as children of the light, and of the day, even the day of holiness: for such "put on Christ," the light of the world, <Q>and make no more provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</Q> So that the Light, Spirit, and Grace that comes by Christ, and appears in man, was what the apostles ministered from, and turned people's minds unto, and in which they ga∣thered and built up the churches of Christ in their day. For which cause they advised them not to quench the Spirit, but wait for the Spirit, and speak by the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit too, as that which approved them the truly begotten children of God, <Q>born not of flesh and blood, nor of the will of man, but of the will of God;</Q> by doing his will, and denying their own; by drinking of Christ's cup, and being baptized with his baptism of self-denial: the way and path that all the heirs of life have trod to blessedness. But alas! even in the apostles days (those bright stars of the first magnitude of the gospel-light) some clouds (foretelling an eclipse of this pri∣mitive glory) began to appear, and several of them gave early caution of it to the christians of their time; that even then there was, and yet would be more and more, a falling away from the power of godliness, and the purity of that spiritual dispensation, by such as thought to make a fair shew in the flesh, but with whom the offence of the cross ceased: yet with this comfortable conclusion, that they saw beyond it a more glorious time than ever, to the true church. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight was true, and what they foretold to the churches, ga∣thered by them in the name and power of Jesus, came so to pass: for christians degenerated apace into outsides, as days, and meats, and divers other ceremonies. And which was worse, they sell into strife and contention about them, separating one from another, then envying, and, as they had power, persecuting one another, to the shame and scan∣dal of their common christianity, and grievous stumbling
<PB N="vii" REF="037441_0006_100D8D6AA2812CF8"/>and offence of the heathen, among whom the Lord had so long and so marvellously preserved them. And having got at last the worldly power into their hands, by kings and emperors embracing the christian profession, they changed what they could the kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world, into a worldly kingdom; or at least stiled the world∣ly kingdom that was in their hands the kingdom of Christ, and so they became worldly, and not true christians. Then human inventions and novelties, both in doctrine and wor∣ship, crowded fast into the church, a door being opened thereunto by the grossness and carnality that appeared then among the generality of christians; who had long since left the guidance of God's meek and heavenly Spirit, and given themselves up to superstition, will-worship, and voluntary humility. And as superstition is blind, so it is heady and furious; for all must stoop to its blind and boundless zeal, or perish by it: in the name of the Spirit, persecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in others, and oppo∣sing that in them which they resisted in themselves, viz. the Light, Grace, and Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ; but always under the notion of innovation, heresy, schism, or some such plausible name. Though christianity allows of no name or pretence whatever for persecuting of any man for matters of mere religion; religion being in its very nature meek, gentle, and forbearing; and consists of faith, hope, and charity, which no persecutor can have, whilst he re∣mains a persecutor; in that a man cannot believe well, or hope well, or have a charitable or tender regard to another, whilst he would violate his mind or persecute his body for matters of faith or worship towards his God.</P>
<P>Thus the false church sprang up, and mounted the chair. But though she lost her nature, she would keep her good name of the Lamb's bride, the true church and mother of the faithful; constraining all to receive her mark, either in their forehead or right-hand, publickly or privately: but in deed and in truth she was Mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots: mother of those that with all their show and outside of religion, were adulterated and gone from the Spi∣rit, nature, and life of Christ, and grown vain, worldly, ambitious, covetous, cruel, &amp;c. which are the fruits of the flesh, and not of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Now it was that the true church fled into the wilderness, that is, from superstition and violence to a retired, solitary, and lonely state; hidden and as it were out of sight of men,
<PB N="viii" REF="037441_0007_100D8D6C367BE810"/>tho' not out of the world: which shews that her wonted visibility was not essential to the being of a true church in the judgment of the Holy Ghost; she being as true a church in the wilderness, though not as visible and lustrous, as when she was in her former splendor of profession. In this state many attempts she made to return, but the waters were yet too high, and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent children in several nations and centuries fell by the cruelty of superstition, because they would not fall from their faithfulness to the truth.</P>
<P>The last age did set some steps towards it, both as to doctrine, worship, and practice. But practice quickly fail∣ed, for wickedness flowed in a little time, as well among the professors of the reformation, as those they reformed from; so that by the fruits of conversation they were not to be dis∣tinguished. And the children of the reformers, if not the reformers themselves, betook themselves very early to earthly policy and power to uphold and carry on their reformation that had been begun with spiritual weapons; which I have often thought has been one of the greatest reasons the re∣formation made no better progress, as to the life and soul of religion: for whilst the reformers were lowly and spi∣ritually-minded, and trusted in God, and looked to Him, and lived in his fear, and consulted not with flesh and blood, nor sought deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the church such as, one might reasonably say, should be saved. For they were not so careful to be safe from persecution, as to be faithful under it.</P>
<P>Being more concerned to spread the truth by their faith and patience in tribulation, than to get the worldly pow∣er out of their hands that inflicted their sufferings upon them; and it will be well, if the Lord suffer them not to fall by the very same way they took to stand. In doctrine they were in some things short; in other things, to avoid one extreme, they ran into another: and for worship, there was for the generality more of man than God. They owned the Spirit, inspiration and revelation indeed, and grounded their separation and reformation upon the sense and under∣standing they received from it, in the reading of the scrip∣tures of Truth; and this was their plea, The Scripture was the text, the Spirit the interpreter, and that to every one for himself. But yet there was too much of human invention, tradition and art, that remained both in praying and preach∣ing, and of worldly authority and worldly greatness in their
<PB N="ix" REF="037441_0008_100D8D6DCEDC1F78"/>ministers, especially in this kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, and some parts of Germany. God was therefore pleased, among us, to shift from vessel to vessel: and the next remove hum∣bled the ministry, so that they were more strict in preach∣ing, devout in praying, and zealous for keeping the Lord's day, and catechising of children and servants, and repeating at home in their families what they had heard in publick.</P>
<P>But even as these grew into power, they were not only for whipping some out, but others into the temple: and they appeared rigid in their spirits, rather than severe in their lives, and more for a party, than for piety: which brought forth another people, that were yet more retired and select. They would not communicate at large, or in common with others; but formed churches among themselves of such as could give some account of their conversion at least, of very promising experiences of the work of God's grace upon their hearts, and under mutual agreements and covenants of fel∣lowship they kept together. These people were somewhat of a softer temper, and seemed to recommend religion by the charms of its love, mercy, and goodness, rather than by the terrors of its judgments and punishment; by which the former party would have terrified people into Religion.</P>
<P>They also allowed greater liberty to prophecy than those before them; for they admitted any member to speak or pray, as well as their pastor (whom they always chose, and not the civil magistrate). If such found any thing pressing upon them to either duty, even without the distinction of clergy or laity; persons of any trade, be it never so low and mechanical. But alas! even these people suffered great loss. for tasting of worldly empire, and the favour of princes, and the gain that ensued, they degenerated but too much. For though they had cried down national churches, and minis∣try and maintenance too, some of them, when it was their own turn to be tried, fell under the weight of worldly ho∣nour and advantage, got into profitable parsonages too much, and outlived and contradicted their own principles: and, which was yet worse, turned some of them absolute persecutors of other men for God's sake, that but so lately came themselves out of the furnace; which drove many a step farther, and that was into the water. Another baptism, as believing they were not scripturally baptised; and hoping to find that presence and power of God, in submitting to that ordinance, which they desired and wanted.</P>
<P>These people made also profession of neglecting, if not
<PB N="x" REF="037441_0009_100D8D6FBA6EA9F8"/>renouncing and censuring, not only the necessity, but use of all human learning, as to the ministry; and all other qualifications to it, besides the helps and gifts of the Spirit of God, and those natural and common to men; and for a time they seemed, like John of old, a burning and a shining light, to other societies.</P>
<P>They were very diligent, plain and serious, strong in scripture, and bold in profession, bearing much reproach and contradiction: but that which others fell by proved their hurt. For worldly power spoiled them too; who had enough of it to try them, what they would do if they had more; and they rested also too much upon their watery dis∣pensation, instead of passing on more fully to the Fire and Holy Ghost, which was his baptism who came with a <Q>fan in his hand, that he might throughly (and not in part only) purge his floor,</Q> and take away the dross and the tin of his people, and make a man finer than gold. Withal, they grew high, rough, and self-righteous, opposing further attainment; too much forgetting the day of their infancy and littleness, which gave them something of a real beauty; in∣somuch that many left them, and all visible churches and societies. and wandered up and down as sheep without a shepherd, and as doves without their mates; seeking their beloved, but could not find him, as their souls desired to know him; whom their souls loved above their chiefest joy.</P>
<P>These people were called Seekers by some, and the Fa∣mily of Love by others; because, as they came to the know∣ledge of one another, they sometimes met together, not for∣mally to pray or preach, at appointed times and places, in their own wills, as in times past they were accustomed to do; but waited together in silence, and as any thing rose in any one of their minds, that they thought savoured of a divine spring, so they sometimes spoke. But so it was, that some of them not keeping in humility, and in the fear of God. af∣ter the abundance of revelation, were exalted above measure, and for want of staying their minds in an humble depend∣ance upon him that opened their understandings to see great things in his law, they run out in their own imaginations, and mixing them with those divine openings, brought sorth a monstrous birth, to the scandal of those that feared God, and waited daily in the temple. not made with hands, for the consolation of Israel; the Jew inward, and Circumcision in spirit.</P>
<P>This people obtained the name of Ranters from their ex∣travagant
<PB N="xi" REF="037441_0010_100D8D71C3649378"/>discourses and practices. For they interpreted Christ's fulfilling of the law for us, to be a discharging of us from any obligation and duty the law required, instead of the condemnation of the law for sins past, upon faith and re∣pentance, and that now it was no sin to do that which before it was a sin to commit; the slavish fear of the law being ta∣ken off by Christ, and all things good that man did, if he did but do them with the mind and persuasion that it was so. Insomuch that divers fell into gross and enormous practices; pretending in excuse thereof, that they could, without evil, commit the same act which was sin in another to do; there∣by distinguishing between the action and the evil of it, by the direction of the mind and intention in the doing of it. Which was to make sin super-abound by the aboundings of grace, and to turn from the grace of God into wantonness, a securer way of sinning than before: as if Christ came not to take away sin, but that we might sin more freely at his cost, and with less danger to ourselves. I say, this ensnared divers, and brought them to an utter and lamentable loss, as to their eternal state; and they grew very troublesome to the better sort of people, and furnished the looser with an occasion to prophane.</P>
<P>It was about that very same time, as you may see in the ensuing annals, that the eternal, wise, and good God was pleased, in his infinite love, to honour and visit this benight∣ed and bewildered nation with his glorious day-spring from on high; yea with a most sure and certain sound of the word of light and life, through the testimony of a chosen vessel, to an effectual and blessed purpose, can many thousands say, "Glory be to the name of the Lord for ever."</P>
<P>For as it reached the conscience, and broke the heart, and brought many to a sense and search; so what people had been vainly seeking without, with much pains and cost, they by this ministry found within; where it was they wanted what they sought for, viz. the right way to peace with God. For they were directed to the light of Jesus Christ within them, as the Seed and Leaven of the kingdom of God; near all, because in all, and God's talent to all. A faithful and true witness and just monitor in every bosom. The gift and grace of God to life and salvation, that appears to all, though few regard it. This, the traditional christian. con∣ceited of himself, and strong in his own will and righteous∣ness, and overcome with blind zeal and passion, either des∣pised as a low and common thing, or opposed as a novelty,
<PB N="xii" REF="037441_0011_100D8D745E58C898"/>under many hard names and opprobrious terms; denying, in his ignorant and angry mind, any fresh manifestation of God's power and Spirit in man in these days, though never more needed to make true christians: not u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>like those Jews of old, that rejected the Son of God at the very same time that they blindly professed to wait for the Messiah to come; because, alas, he appeared not among them according to their carnal mind and expectation.</P>
<P>This brought forth many abusive books, which filled the greater sort with envy, and lesser with rage, and made the way and progress of this blessed testimony strait and nar∣row indeed to those that received it. However, God owned his own work, and this testimony did effectually reach, ga∣ther, comfort, and establish the weary and heavy laden, the hungry and thirsty, the poor and needy, the mournful and sick of many maladies, that had spent all upon physicians of no value, and waited for relief from heaven, help only from above: seeing, upon a serious trial of all things, nothing else would do but Christ himself, the light of his counte∣nance, a touch of his garment, and help from his hand, who cured the poor woman's issue, raised the centurion's servant, the widow's son, the ruler's daughter, and Peter's mother, and, like her they no sooner felt his power and efficacy upon their souls, but they gave up to obey him in a testi∣mony to his power, and with resigned wills and faithful hearts, through all mockings, contradictions, beatings, pri∣sons, and many other jeopardies that attended them for his blessed name's sake.</P>
<P>And truly, they were very many and very great; so that in all human probability they must have been swallowed up quick of the proud and boisterous waves that swelled and beat against them; but that the God of all their tender mer∣cies was with them in his glorious authority, so that the hills often fled, and the mountains melted before the power that filled them; working mightily for them, as well as in them, one ever following the other. By which they saw plainly, to their exceeding great confirmation and comfort, <Q>that all things were possible with him with whom they had to do.</Q> And that the more that which God required seemed to cross man's wisdom, and expose, them to man's wrath, the more God appeared to help and carry them through all to his glory: insomuch that if ever any people could say in truth, <Q>Thou art our sun and our shield, our rock and sanctuary, and by thee we have leaped over a
<PB N="xiii" REF="037441_0012_100D8D75F7AEB708"/>wall, and by thee we have run through a troop, and by thee we have put the armies of the aliens to flight,</Q> these people had right to say it. And as God had delivered their souls of the wearisome burthens of sin and vanity, and en∣riched their poverty of spirit, and satisfied their great hunger and thirst after eternal righteousness, and filled them with the good things of his own house, and made them stewards of his manifold gifts; so they went forth to all quarters of these nations, to declare to the inhabitants thereof, what God had done for them; what they had found, and where and how they had found it; viz. the way to peace with God: invit∣ing them to come and see and taste for themselves, the truth of what they declared unto them.</P>
<P>And as their testimony was to the principle of God in man, the precious pearl and leaven of the kingdom, as the only blessed means appointed of God to quicken, convince, and sanctify man; so they opened to them what it was in it∣self, and what it was given to them for: how they might know it from their own spirit, and that of the subtil appear∣ance of the evil one, and what it would do for all those, whose minds are turned off from the vanity of the world, and its lifeless ways and teachers, and adhere to this blessed light in themselves, which discovers and condemns sin in all its appearances, and shews how to overcome it, if minded and obeyed in its holy manifestations and convictions: giv∣ing power to such to avoid and resist those things that do not please God, and to grow strong in love, faith, and good works: that so man, whom sin hath made as a wilderness, over-run with briars and thorns, might become as the gar∣den of God, cultivated by his divine power, and replenished with the most virtuous and beautiful plants of God's own right-hand planting, to his eternal praise.</P>
<P>But these experimental preachers of glad tidings of God's truth and kingdom could not run when they lift, or pray or preach when they pleased, but as Christ their Redeemer prepared and moved them by his own blessed Spirit, for which they waited in their services and meetings, and spoke as that gave them utterance, and which was as those having authority, and not like the dreaming, dry, and formal Pha∣risees. And so it plainly appeared to the serious-minded, whose spiritual eye the Lord Jesus had in any measure open∣ed; so that to one was given the word of exhortation, to another the word of reproof, to another the word of conso∣lation,
<PB N="xiv" REF="037441_0013_100D8D780B521DF8"/>and all by the same Spirit and in the good order thereof, to the convincing and edifying of many.</P>
<P>And truly they waxed strong and bold through faithful∣ness; and by the power and Spirit of the Lord Jesus became very fruitful; thousands, in a short time, being turned to the truth through their testimony in ministry and sufferings, insomuch as in most counties, and many of the considerable towns of England, meetings were settled, and daily there were added such as should be saved. For they were diligent to plant and to water, and the Lord blessed their labours with an exceeding great increase, notwithstanding all the op∣position made to their blessed progress, by false rumours, calumnies, and bitter persecutions; not only from the pow∣ers of the earth, but from every one that listed to injure and abuse them: so that they seemed indeed to be as poor sheep appointed to the slaughter, and as a people killed all the day long.</P>
<P>It were fitter for a volume than a preface, but so much as to repeat the contents of their cruel sufferings from profes∣sors as well as from prophane, and from magistrates as well as the rabble; so that it may well be said of this abused and despised people, they went forth weeping, and sowed in tears, bearing testimony to the precious seed, the seed of the kingdom, which stands not in words, the finest, the highest that man's wit can use, but in power; the power of Christ Jesus, to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth, that he might rule angels above, and men below; who impowered them, as their work witnesseth, by the many that were turned through their ministry from darkness to the light, and out of the broad into the narrow way, bringing people to a weighty, serious, and godly con∣versation; the practice of that doctrine which they taught.</P>
<P>And as without this secret divine power there is no quick∣ening and regenerating of dead souls, so the want of this ge∣nerating and begetting power and life is the cause of the lit∣tle fruit that the many ministries that have been, and are in the world bring forth. O that both ministers and people were sensible of this! My soul is often troubled for them, and sorrow and mourning compass me about for their sakes. O that they were wise! O that they would consider and lay to heart the things that truly and substantially make for their lasting peace!</P>
<P>Two things are to be briefly touched upon, the doctrine they taught, and the example they led among all people. I
<PB N="xv" REF="037441_0014_100D8D7A81B001C0"/>have already touched upon their fundamental principle, which is as the corner stone of their fabrick: and to speak eminently and properly, their characteristick, or main di∣stinguishing point or principle, viz. the light of Christ with∣in, as God's gift for man's salvation. This, I say, is as the root of the goodly tree of doctrines that grew and branched out from it, which I shall now mention in their natural and experimental order.</P>
<P>First, repentance from dead works to serve the living God. Which comprehends three operations. First, A sight of sin. Secondly, A sense and godly sorrow for it. Thirdly, An amendment for the time to come. This was the repent∣ance they preached and pressed, and a natural result from the principle they turned all people unto. For of light came sight; and of sight came sense and sorrow; and of sense and sorrow, came amendment of life: which doctrine of repent∣ance leads to justification; that is, forgiveness of the sins that are past through Christ, the alone propitiation; and the sanc∣tification or purgation of the soul from the defiling nature and habits of sin present; which is justification in the complete sense of that word; comprehending both justification from the guild of the sins that are past, as if they had never been cominitted, through the love and mercy of God in Christ Jesus; and the creature's being made inwardly just through the cleansing and sanctifying power and Spirit of Christ re∣vealed in the soul; which is commonly called sanctification.</P>
<P>From hence sprang a second doctrine they were led to de∣clare, as the mark of the prize of the high calling of all true Christians, viz. perfection from sin, according to the scrip∣tures of truth, which testify it to be the end of Christ's com∣ing, and the nature of his kingdom, and for which his Spi∣rit was given. But they never held a perfection in wisdom and glory in this life, or from natural infirmities or death, as some have with a weak or ill mind imagined and insinuated against them.</P>
<P>This they called a redeemed state, regeneration, or the new birth: teaching every where according to their foundation, that without this work were known, there was no inheriting the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Third, to an acknowledgement of eternal rewards and punishment, as they have good reason; for else of all peo∣ple, certainly they must be the most miserable: who for about forty years have been exceeding great sufferers for their pro∣fession,
<PB N="xvi" REF="037441_0015_100D8D7C88359000"/>and in some cases treated worse than the worst of men, yea as the refuse and off-scouring of all things.</P>
<P>This was the purport of their doctrine and ministry; which, for the most part, is what other professors of Christianity pre∣tend to hold in words and forms, but not in the power of god∣liness; that has been long lost by mens departing from that principle and seed of life that is in man, and which man has not regarded, but lost the sense of, and in and by which he can only be quickened in his mind to serve the living God in newness of life. For as the life of religion was lost, and the generality lived and worshipped God after their own wills, and not after the will of God, nor the mind of Christ, which stood in the works and fruits of the Holy Spirit; so that which they pressed was not notion but experience, nor for∣mality but godliness; as being sensible in themselves, through the work of God's righteous judgments, that with∣out holiness no man should ever see the Lord with comfort.</P>
<P>Besides these doctrines, and out of them, as the larger branches, there sprang forth several particular doctrines, that did exemplify and further explain the truth and efficacy of the general doctrine before observed in their lives and exam∣ples. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. Communion and loving one another. This is a noted mark in the mouth of all sorts of people concerning them. "They will meet, they will help and stick one to another." Whence it is common to hear some say, <Q>Look how the Quakers love and take care of one another.</Q> Others less moderate will say, "The Quakers love none but themselves;" and if loving one another, and haying an intimate commu∣nion in religion, and constant care to meet to worship God and help one another, be any mark of primitive christianity, they had it, blessed be the Lord, in an ample manner.</P>
<P N="2">II. To love enemies: this they both taught and prac∣tised: for they did not only refuse to be revenged for injuries done them, and condemned it as of an unchristian spirit, but they did freely forgive, yea help and relieve, those that had been cruel to them, when it was in their power to have been even with them; of which many and singular instances might be given: endeavouring, through patience, to overcome all injustice and oppression, and preaching this doctrine as christian for others to follow.</P>
<P N="3">III. The sufficiency of truth-speaking, according to Christ's own form of words, of yea, yea, and nay, nay, a∣mong christians, without Wearing, both from Christ's ex∣press
<PB N="xvii" REF="037441_0016_100D8D7E7B1AA938"/>prohibition to "swear at all," Mat. v. and for that they being under the tie and bond of truth in themselves, there was both no necessity for an oath, and it would be a reproach to their christian veracity to assure their truth by such an ex∣traordinary way of speaking: but offering at the same time to be punished to the full for false speaking, as others for perjury, if ever guilty of it; and hereby they exclude, with all true, all false and profane swearing; for which the land did and doth mourn, and the great God was and is not a lit∣tle offended with it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Not fighting but suffering is another testimony pe∣culiar to this people: they affirm that Christianity teacheth people <Q>to beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more, that so the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that destroys be entertained in the hearts of people;</Q> exhorting them to employ their zeal against sin, and turn their anger against satan, and no longer war one against another; because all wars and fightings come of mens own hearts lusts, according to the apostle James, and not of the meek Spirit of Christ Jesus, who is captain of another warfare, and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as truth-speaking succeeded swearing, so faith and truth succeeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they for this to be obnoxious to civil government, since if they cannot fight for it, neither can they fight against it; which is no mean security to the state: nor is it reasonable that people should be blamed for not do∣ing more for others than they can do for themselves. And Christianity set aside, if the costs and fruits of war were well considered, peace, with its inconveniencies, is generally pre∣ferable. But though they were not for fighting, they were for submitting to government; and that not only for fear, but for conscience sake, where government doth not interfere with conscience: believing it to be an ordinance of God, and where it is justly administred, a great benefit to mankind: though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in some, and interest in others, to have felt the strokes of it with greater weight and rigour than any other persuasion in this age; whilst they, of all others (religion set aside) have given the civil magistrate the least occasion of trouble in the dis∣charge of his office.</P>
<P N="5">V. Another part of the character of this people is, they refuse to pay tythes, or maintenance to a national ministry,
<PB N="xviii" REF="037441_0017_100D8D8129AE2E68"/>and that for two reasons; the one is, that they believe all compelled maintenance, even to gospel ministers, to be un∣lawful, because expressly contrary to Christ's command, who said, "Freely you have received, freely give:" at least, that the maintenance of gospel ministers should be free and not forced. The other reason of their refusal is, because those ministers are not gospel ones, in that the Holy Ghost is not their foundation, but human arts and parts: so that it is not matter of humour or fullenness, but pure conscience towards God, that they cannot help to support national ministers where they dwell, which are but too much and too visibly become ways of worldly advantage and preferment.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Not to respect persons, was another of their doc∣trines and practices, for which they were often buffeted and abused. They affirmed it to be sinful to give flattering ti∣tles, or to use vain gestures and compliments of respect; though to virtue and authority they ever made a difference, but after their plain and homely manner, yet sincere and substantial way; well remembering the example of Morde cai and Elihu, but more especially the command of their Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who forbad his followers to call men Rabbi, which implies Lord and Master, also the fashionable greetings and salutations of those times; that so self-love and honour, to which the proud mind of man is in∣cident, in his fallen estate, might not be indulged but re∣buked.</P>
<P>They also used the plain language of Thou and Thee to a single person, whatever was his degree among men. And indeed the wisdom of God was much seen, in bringing forth this people in so plain an appearance; for it was a close and distinguishing test upon the spirit of those they came among; shewing their insides and what predominated, notwithstand∣ing their high and great profession of religion. This, among the rest, sounded so harsh to many of them, and they took it so ill, that they would say, <Q>Thou me, thou my dog: if thou thouest me, I'll thou thy teeth down thy throat,</Q> forgetting the language they use to God in their own prayers, and the common style of the Scriptures, and that it is an ab∣solute and essential propriety of speech: and what good had their religion done them, who were so sensibly touch'd with indignation for the use of this plain, honest, and true speech.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They recommended silence by their example, having very few words upon all occasions: they were at a word in dealing; nor could their customers many words tempt them
<PB N="xix" REF="037441_0018_100D8D83901BEAA8"/>from it; having more regard for truth than custom, to ex∣ample than gain, they sought solitude; but when in compa∣ny, they would neither use nor willingly hear unnecessary as well as unlawful discourses; whereby they preserved their minds pure and undisturbed from unprofitable thoughts and diversions: nor could they humour the custom of <Q>good night, good morrow, God speed;</Q> for they knew the night was good, and the day was good, without wishing of either; and that in the other expression, the holy name of God was too lightly and unthinkingly used, and therefore taken in vain. Besides they were words and wishes of course, and are usually as little meant, as are love and service in the custom of cap and knee; and superfluity in those as well as in other things was burthensome to them, and therefore they did not only decline to use them, but sound themselves of∣ten prest to reprove the practice.</P>
<P>For the same reason they forbore drinking to people, or pledging of them, as the manner of the world is: a practice that is not only unnecessary, but they thought evil in the tendencies of it; being a provocation to drinking more than did people good, as well as that it was in itself vain and heathenish.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Their way of marriage is peculiar to them, and is a distinguishing practice from all other societies professing christianity. They say that marriage is an ordinance of God, and that God only can rightly join man and woman in marriage. Therefore they use neither priest nor magis∣trate, but the man and woman concerned take each other as husband and wife in the presence of divers credible wit∣nesses, <Q>promising unto each other, with God's assistance, to be loving and faithful in that relation till death shall se∣parate them.</Q> But, antecedent to all this, they first pre∣sent themselves to the monthly meeting for the affairs of the church where they reside; there declaring their intentions to take one another as man and wife, if the said meeting have nothing material to object against it. They are constantly alked the necessary questions, as in case of parents or guar∣dians, if they have acquainted them with their intention, and have their consent, &amp;c. The method of the meeting is to take a minute thereof, and to appoint proper persons to en∣quire of their conversation and clearness from all others, and whether they have discharged their duty to their parents or guardian, and make report thereof the next monthly meet∣ing; where the same parties are desired to give their attend∣ance.
<PB N="xx" REF="037441_0019_100D8D857A08EB18"/>In case it appears they proceeded orderly, the meet∣ing passes their proposal, and so records it in their meeting-book; and in case the woman be a widow and hath chil∣dren, due care is there taken, that provision also be made by her for the orphans before the said marriage; advising the parties concerned to appoint a convenient time and place, and to give fitting notice to their relations, and such friends and neighbours as they desire should be the wituesses of their marriage: where they take one another by the hand, and by name promising reciprocally after the manner before ex∣pressed. Of all which proceedings a narrative, in a way of certificate, is made, to which the said parties first set their hands, thereby making it their act and deed; and then di∣vers of the relations, spectators, and auditors set their names as witnesses of what they said and signed. Which certisi∣cate is afterwards registered in the record belonging to the meeting where the marriage is solemnized. Which regular method has been, as it deserves, adjudged in courts of law a good marriage, where it has been disputed and contested for want of the accustomed formality of priest and ring. &amp;c. Which ceremonies they have refused, not out of humour, but conscience reasonably grounded, inasmuch as no scrip∣ture-example tells us, that the priest had any other part of old time than that of a witness among the rest, before whom the Jews used to take one another: and therefore this people look upon it as an imposition to advance the power and profits of the clergy. And for the use of the ring, it is enough to say, that it was an heathen and vain custom, and never in practice among the people of God, Jews or primitive Chris∣tians. The words of the usual form, as "With my body I thee worship." &amp;c. are hardly defensible: in short, they are more careful, exact, and regular than any form now used, and it is free of the inconveniencies other methods are attended with. Their care and checks being so many, and such as no clandestine marriages can be performed among them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It may not be unfit to say something here of their births and burials, which make up so much of the pomp and solemnity of too many called Christians. For births, the parents name their own children, which is usually some days after they are born, in the presence of the midwife (if she can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there) and those that were at the birth, &amp;c. who after∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds sign a certificate, for that purpose prepared, of the birth and name of the child or children, which is recorded
<PB N="xxi" REF="037441_0020_100D8D871962E2D8"/>in aproper book in the monthly meeting, to which the pa∣rents belong; avoiding the accustomed ceremonies and festivals.</P>
<P N="10">X. Their burials are performed with the same simplicity. If the corpse of the deceased be near any public meeting-place, it is usually carried thither, for the more convenient reception of those that accompany it to the ground they bu∣ry in; and it so falls out sometimes, that while the meeting is gathering for the burial, some or other have a word of ex∣hortation, for the sake of the people there met together: af∣ter which the body is borne away by the young men, or those that are of their neighbourhood, or that were most of the in∣timacy of the deceased party; the corpse being in a plain coffin, without any covering or furniture upon it. At the ground, they pause some time before they put the body in∣to its grave, that if any one there should have any thing up∣on them to exhort the people, they may not be disappoint∣ed, and that the relations may the more retiredly and so∣lemnly take their last leave of the corpse of their departed kindred, and the spectators have a sense of mortality, by the occasion then given them to reflect upon their own lat∣ter end. Otherwise, they have no set rites or ceremonies on those occasions; neither do the kindred of the deceased ever wear mourning; they looking upon it as a worldly ce∣remony, and piece of pomp; and that what mourning is fit for a christian to have at the departure of a beloved relation or friend, should be worn in the mind, which is only sensi∣ble of the loss, and the love they had to them, and remem∣brance of them, to be outwardly expressed by a respect to their advice, and care of those they have left behind them, and their love of that they loved. Which conduct of theirs, tho' unmodish or unfashionable, leaves nothing of the sub∣stance of things neglected or undone; and as they aim at no more, so that simplicity of life is what they observe with great satisfaction, though it sometimes happens not to be without the mockeries of the vain world they live in.</P>
<P>These things gave them a rough and disagreeable appear∣ance with the generality; who thought them turners of the world upside-down, as indeed in some sense they were; but in no other than that wherein Paul was so charged, viz. to bring things back into their primitive and right order again. For these and such like practices of theirs were not the result of humour, as some have fancied, but a fruit of inward sense, which God, through his fear, had begotten in them. They
<PB N="xxii" REF="037441_0021_100D8D893A926E38"/>did not consider how to contradict the world, or distinguish themselves; being none of their business, as it was not their interest, no, it was not the result of their consultation, or a framed design to declare or recommend schism or novelty. But God having given them a sight of themselves, they saw the whole world in the same glass of truth; and sensibly dis∣cerned the affections and passions of men, and the rise and tendency of things. What gratified <Q>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world;</Q> and from thence sprang in that night of darkness and apostacy, which hath been over people, through their degeneracy from the light and Spirit of God, these and many other vain customs; which are seen by the heavenly day of Christ, which dawns in the soul, to be, either wrong in their original, or, by time or abuse, hurtful in their practice. And though these things seemed trivial to some, and rendered this people stingy and conceit∣ed in such persons opinions, there was and is more in them than they were aware of. It was not very easy to our pri∣mitive friends to make themselves sights and spectacles, and the scorn and derision of the world; which they easily fore∣saw must be the consequence of so unfashionable a conversa∣tion in it. But herein was the wisdom of God seen, in the foolishness of these things. First, That they discovered the satisfaction and concern that people had in and for the fashions of this world, notwithstanding their pretences to an∣other; in that any disappointment about them came so very near them, that the greatest honesty, virtue, wisdom, and ability, were unwelcome without them. Secondly, It sea∣sonably and prositably divided conversation; for making their society uneasy to their relations and acquaintance, it gave them the opportunity of more retirement and solitude, wherein they met with better company, even the Lord God their Redeemer, and grew strong in his love, power, and wisdom, and were thereby better qualified for his service, and the success abundantly shewed it; blessed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>And though they were not great and learned in the esteem of this world (for then they had not wanted followers upon their own credit and authority) yet they were generally of the most sober of the several persuasions they were in, and of the most repute for religion; and many of them of good capa∣city, substance, and account among men.</P>
<P>And also some among them neither wanted for parts,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="037441_0022_100D8D8B9882E318"/>learning nor estate; though then, as of old, not many wise, nor noble, &amp;c. were called, or at least received the heavenly call; because of the cross that attended the profession of it in sincerity: but neither do parts or learning make men the better Christans, though the better orators and disputants; and it is the ignorance of people about the divine gift, that causes that vulgar and mischievous mistake. Theory and practice, expression and enjoyment, words and life, are two things. Oh! 'tis the penitent, the reformed, the lowly, the watchful, the self-denying and holy soul that is the Christian; and that frame is the sruit and work of the Spi∣rit, which is the life of Jesus; whose life, though hid in God the Father, is shed abroad in the hearts of them that truly be∣lieve. Oh! that people did but know this to cleanse them, to circumcise them, to quicken them, and to make them new creatures indeed; re-created or regenerated after Christ Jesus unto good works: that they might live to God, and not to themselves; and offer up living prayers, and living praises, to the living God, through his own living Spirit, in which he is only to be worshipped in this gospel-day. Oh! that they that read me could but feel me; for my heart is affected with this merciful visitation of the Father of lights and spints to this poor nation, and the whole world through the same testimony. Why should the inhabitants thereof re∣ject it? Why should they lose the blessed benefit of it? Why should they not turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and say from the heart, "Speak, Lord, for now thy poor ser∣vants hear?" Oh! that thy will may be done, thy great, thy good and holy will, on earth as it is in heaven: do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us; for we are thine, and desire to glorify thee our Creator, both for that, and because thou art our Redeemer, for thou art redeeming us from the earth, from the vanities and pollutions of it, to be a peculiar people unto thee. Oh! this were a brave day for England, if so she could say in truth. But alas, the case is otherwise, for which some of thine inhabitants, O land of my nativity! have mourned over thee with bitter wailing and lamentation. Their heads have been indeed as waters, and their eyes as fountains of tears, because of thy transgression and stiffneckedness; because thou wilt not hear, and fear, and return to the Rock, even thy Rock, O Eng∣land! from whence thou wert hewn. But be thou warned, O land of great pros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion, to receive him into thy heart! Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> door it is he hath stood so long knocking, but
<PB N="xxiv" REF="037441_0023_100D8D8D86D0CBF8"/>thou wilt yet have none of him. Oh! be thou awakened, lest Jerusalem's judgments do swiftly overtake thee, because of Jerusalem's sins that abound in thee. For she abounded in formality, but made void the weighty things of God's law, as thou daily dost.</P>
<P>She withstood the Son of God in the flesh, and thou re∣sistest the Son of God in the Spirit. He would have gather∣ed her, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and she would not! so would he have gathered thee out of thy lifeless profession, and have brought thee to inherit substance, to have known his power and kingdom, for which he often knocked within, by his Grace and Spirit, and without, by his servants and witnesses; but thou wouldst not be gather∣ed: but on the contrary, as Jerusalem of old persecuted the manifestation of the Son of God in the flesh, and crucified him, and whipped and imprisoned his servants, so hast thou, O land, crucified to thyself afresh the Lord of life and glory, and done despite to his Spirit of grace; slighting the fatherly visitation, and persecuting the blessed dispensers of it by thy laws and magistrates; though they have early and late pleaded with thee in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in love and meekness, that thou mightest know the Lord, and serve him, and become the glory of all lands.</P>
<P>But thou hast evilly entreated and requited them. Thou hast set at nought all their counsel, and wouldst have none of their reproof, as thou shouldst have done. Their ap∣pearance was too strait, and their qualifications were too mean for thee to receive them, who, like the Jews of old, that cried, <Q>Is not this the carpenter's son? and are not his brethren among us? which of the scribes, of the learn∣ed (the orthodox) believe in him?</Q> Prophesying their fall in a year or two, and making and executing of severe laws to bring it to pass, by endeavouring to terrify them out of their holy way, or destroying them for abiding faithful to it. But thou hast seen how many governments that rose against them, and determined their downfal, have been overturned and extinguished, and that they are still preserved, and become a great and a considerable people among the middle sort of thy numerous inhabitants. And notwithstanding the many difficulties, without and within, which they have laboured under, since the Lord God Eternal first gathered them, they are an increasing people, the Lord still adding unto them, in divers parts, such as shall be saved, if they persevere to the end. And to thee were they and are they lifted up as a
<PB N="xxv" REF="037441_0024_100D8D8F34A04A40"/>standard, and as a city set upon a hill, and to the nations round about thee, that in their light thou mayest come to see light, even in Christ Jesus, the light of the world; and therefore thy light and life too, if thou wouldst but turn from thy many evil ways, and receive and obey it. For in the <Q>light of the Lamb must the nations of them that are saved walk,</Q> as the scriptures testify.</P>
<P>Remember, O nation of great profession! how the Lord has waited upon thee since the days of reformation, and the many mercies and judgments with which he has pleaded with thee; and awake and arise out of thy deep sleep, and yet hear his word in thy heart, that thou mayest live.</P>
<P>Let not this thy day of visitation pass over thy head, not neglect thou so great salvation as is this which is come to thy house, O England! For why shouldst thou die. O land that God desires to bless? Be assured it is he that has been in the midst of this people, in the midst of thee; and no de∣lusion, as thy mistaken teachers have made thee believe. And this thou shalt find by their marks and fruits, if thou wilt consider them in the spirit of moderation. For,</P>
<P N="1">I. They were changed men themselves before they went about to change others. Their hearts were rent as well as their garments changed, and they knew the power and work of God upon them. This was seen by the great alteration it made, and their stricter course of life, and more godly con∣versation, that immediately followed upon it.</P>
<P N="2">II. They went not forth or preached in their own time or will, but in the will of God, and spoke not their own stu∣died matter, but as they were opened and moved of his Spi∣rit. with which they were well acquainted in their own con∣version; which cannot be expressed to carnal men so as to give them any intelligible account, for to such it is, as Christ said, <Q>like the blowing of the wind, which no man knows whence it cometh, or whither it goeth:</Q> yet this proof and seal went along with their ministry, that many were turned from their lifeless professions and the evil of their ways, to the knowledge of God and an holy life, as thousands can wit∣ness. And as they freely received what they had to say from the Lord, so they freely administered it to others.</P>
<P N="3">III. The bent and stress of their ministry was conversion to God, regeneration, and holiness; not schemes of doc∣trines and verbal creeds, or new forms of worship; but a leaving off in religion the supersluous, and reducing the ce∣remonious and formal part, and pressing earnestly the substan∣tial,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="037441_0025_100D8D917AF25CD0"/>the necessary and profitable part; as all upon a serious reflection must and do acknowledge.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They directed people to a principle, by which all that they asserted, preached, and exhorted others to, might be wrought in them, and known, through experience, to them to be true; which is a high and distinguishing mark of the truth of their ministry; both that they knew what they said, and were not afraid of coming to the test. For as they were bold from certainty, so they required confor∣mity upon no human authority, but upon conviction, and the conviction of this principle, which they asserted was in them that they preached unto, and unto that directed them, that they might examine and prove the reality of those things which they had affirmed of it, and its manifestation and work in man. And this is more than the many mini∣stries in the world pretend to. They declare of religion; say many things true in words, of God, Christ, and the Spirit; of holiness and heaven; that all men should repent and mend their lives, or they will go to hell, &amp;c. but which of them all pretend to speak of their own knowledge and experience? or ever directed men to a divine principle or agent, placed of God in man, to help him? and how to know it, and wait to feel its power to work that good and acceptable will of God in them?</P>
<P>Some of them indeed have spoke of the Spirit, and the operations of it to sanctification, and performance of worship to God; but where and how to find it, and wait in it to perform, was yet as a mystery reserved for this further de∣gree of reformation. So that this people did not only in words more than equally press repentance, conversion, and holiness, but did it knowingly and experimentally; and directed those to whom they preached to a sufficient princi∣ple, and told them where it is, and by what tokens they might know it, and which way they might experience the power and efficacy of it to their souls happiness: which is more than theory and speculations, upon which most other ministries depend; for here is certainly a bottom upon which man may boldly appear before God in the great day of account.</P>
<P N="5">V. They reached to the inward state and condition of people, which is an evidence of the virtue of their principle, and of their ministring from it, and not their own imagina∣tions, glosses, or comments upon scripture. For nothing reaches the heart but what is from the heart, or pierces the
<PB N="xxvii" REF="037441_0026_100D8D9414B7F098"/>conscience but what comes from a living conscience; inso∣much as it hath often happened, where people have under secrecy revealed their state or condition to some choice friends for advice or ease, they have been so particularly directed in the ministry of this people, that they have challenged their friends with discovering their secrets, and telling the preachers their cases; yea, the very thoughts and purposes of the hearts of many have been so plainly detected, that they have, like Nathaniel, cried out of this inward appear∣ance of Christ, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel." And those that have embraced this divine principle, have found this mark of its truth and divinity, that the woman of Samaria did of Christ when in the flesh, to be the Messiah, viz. "It had told them all that ever they did;" shewed them their insides, the most inward secrets of their hearts, and laid judgment to the line, and righteous∣ness to the plummet; of which thousands can at this day give in their witness. So that nothing has been affirmed by this people of the power and virtue of this heavenly principle, that such as have turned to it have not found true, and more; and that one half had not been told to them of what they have seen of the power, purity, wisdom, mercy, and goodness of God herein.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The accomplishments with which this principle fit∣ted even some of the meanest of this people for their work and service, furnisning some of them with an extraordinary understanding in divine things, and an admirable fluency and taking way of expression, which gave occasion to some to wonder, saying of them, as of their Master, "Is not this such a mechanick's son? how came he by this learning?" As from thence others took occasion to suspect and insinu∣ate they were jesuits in disguise, who have had the reputa∣tion of learned men for an age past, though there was not the least ground of truth for any such reflection.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They came forth low, and despised and hated, as the primitive christians did, and not by the help of worldly wisdom or power, as former reformations in part have done; but in all things it may be said this people were brought forth in the cross, in a contradiction to the ways, worship, fashion, and customs of this world, yea against wind and tide, that so no flesh might glory before God.</P>
<P>They could have no design to themselves in this work, thus to expose themselves to scorn and abuse, to spend and be spent; leaving wife and children, house and land, and
<PB N="xxviii" REF="037441_0027_100D8D95A6F01BF0"/>all that can be accounted dear to men, with their lives in their hands, being daily in jeopardy, to declare this primi∣tive message, 1 John i. v. revived in their spirits by the good Spirit and power of God; viz. <Q>That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all; and that he has sent his Son a light into the world to enlighten all men in order to salvation; and that they that say they have fellowship with God, and are his children and people, and yet walk in darkness, (viz. in disobedience to the light in their con∣sciences, and after the vanity of this world) they lie and do not the truth. But that all such as love the light and bring their deeds to it, and walk in the light, as God is light, the blood of Jesus Christ his son should cleanse them from all sin.</Q></P>
<P N="8">VIII. Their known great constancy and patience in suf∣fering for their testimony, in all the branches of it, and that sometimes unto death, by beatings, bruisings, long and crowded imprisonments, and noisome dungeons. Four of them in New England dying by the hands of the execu∣tioner, purely for preaching amongst that people; besides banishments and excessive plunders and sequestrations of their goods and estates, almost in all parts, not easily to be expressed, and less to be endured, but by those that have the support of a good and glorious cause; refusing deliver∣ance by any indirect ways and means, as often as it was offered to them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That they did not only not shew any disposition to revenge, when it was at any time in their power, but for∣gave their cruel enemies, shewing mercy to those that had none for them.</P>
<P N="10">X. Their plainness with those in authority, not unlike the ancient prophets; not fearing to tell them to their faces of their private and publick sins, and their prophecies to them of their afflictions and downfal, when in the top of their glory; also of some national judgments, as of the plague and fire of London, in express terms, and likewise particular ones to divers persecutors, which accordingly overtook them, and which were very remarkable in the places where they dwelt, and in time they may be made publick for the glory of God.</P>
<P>Thus, reader, thou seest this people in thein rise, princi∣ples, ministry, and progress, both their general and parti∣cular testimony, by which thou mayest be informed how and upon what foot they sprung and became so considerable
<PB N="xxix" REF="037441_0028_100D8D979B29F6D8"/>a people. It remains next that I shew also their care, con∣duct, and discipline, as a christian and reformed society, that they might be found living up to their own principles and profession; and this the rather, because they have hardly suffered more in their character from the unjust charge of error, than by the false imputation of disorder; which ca∣lumny indeed has not failed to follow all the true steps that were ever made to reformation, and under which reproach none suffered more than the primitive christians them∣selves, that were the honour of christianity, and the great lights and examples of their own and succeeding ages.</P>
<P>This people increasing daily both in town and country, an holy care fell upon some of the elders among them for the benefit and service of the church. And the first busi∣ness in their view, after the example of the primitive saints, was the exercise of charity, to supply the necessities of the poor, and answer the like occasions: wherefore collections were early and liberally made for that and divers other ser∣vices in the church, and intrusted with faithful men, fear∣ing God, and of good report, who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own in large proportions, which they never brought to account or desired should be known, much less restored to them, that none might want, nor any service be retarded or disappointed.</P>
<P>They were also very careful, that every one that belonged to them answered their profession in their behaviour among men upon all occasions; that they lived peaceably, and were in all things good examples. They found themselves engaged to record their sufferings and services; and in case of marriage, which they could not perform in the usual me∣thods of the nation, but among themselves, they took care that all things were clear between the parties and all others, and it was then rare that any one entertained such inclina∣tion to a person on that account, till he or she had commu∣nicated it secretly to some very weighty and eminent friends among them, that they might have a sense of the matter; looking to the counsel and unity of their brethren as of great moment to them. But because the charge of the poor, the number of orphans, marriages, sufferings, and other mat∣ters multiplied, and that it was good that the churches were in some way and method of proceeding in such affairs among them, to the end they might the better correspond upon oc∣casion, where a member of one meeting might have to do with one of another; it pleased the Lord in his wisdom and
<PB N="xxx" REF="037441_0029_100D8D9967D382C8"/>goodness to open the understanding of the first instrument of this dispensation of life, about a good and orderly way of proceeding; and he felt an holy concern to visit the churches in person throughout this nation, to begin and establish it among them; and by his epistles the like was done in other nations and provinces abroad, which he also afterwards visited and helped in that service, as shall be ob∣served when I come to speak of him.</P>
<P>Now the care, conduct, and discipline, I have been speak∣ing of, and which is now practised among this people, is as followeth:
This godly elder, in every county where he travelled, exhorted them, that some out of every meeting of worship should meet together once in the month, to confer about the wants and occasions of the church: and as the case re∣quired, so those monthly meetings were fewer or more in number in every respective county; four or six meetings of worship usually making one monthly meeting of business. And accordingly the brethren met him from place to place, and began the said meetings; viz. <Q>For the poor, orphans, orderly walking, integrity to their profession, births, mar∣riages, burials, sufferings, &amp;c.</Q> And that these monthly meetings should in each county make up one quarterly meet∣ing, where the most zealous and eminent friends of the county should assemble to communicate, advise, and help one another, especially when any business seemed difficult, or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter.</P>
<P>Also that these quarterly meetings should digest the re∣ports of the monthly meetings, and prepare one for the county against the yearly meeting, in which the quarterly meetings resolve, which is held yearly in London, where the churches in this nation and other nations and provinces meet, by chosen members of their respective counties, both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to advise and be advised in any depending case to edification; also to provide a requisite stock for the discharge of general ex∣pences for general services in the church, not needful to be here particularized.</P>
<P>At these meetings any of the members of the churches may come, if they please, and speak their minds freely in the fear of God to any matter; but the mind of each meet∣ing therein represented is chiefly understood, as to particu∣lar cases, in the sense delivered by the persons deputed or chosen for that service.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxi" REF="037441_0030_100D8D9C88E9D088"/>
During their yearly meeting, to which their other meet∣ings refer in their order, and resolve themselves, care is taken by a select number, for that service chosen by the ge∣neral assembly, to draw up the minutes of the said meet∣ing upon the several matters that have been under consider∣ation therein, to the end that the respective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings, to∣gether with a general exhortation to holiness, unity and charity: of all which proceedings in yearly, quarterly, and monthly meetings, due record is kept by some one appointed for that service, or that hath voluntarily undertaken it. These meetings are opened and usually concluded in their solemn waiting upon God, who is sometimes graciously pleased to answer them with as signal evidences of his love and pre∣sence, as in any other of their meetings for worship.</P>
<P>It is farther to be noted, that, in these solemn assemblies for the church's service, there is no one presides among them after the manner of the assemblies of other people, Christ only being their president, as he is pleased to appear in life and wisdom in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity or degree, the rest adhere with a firm unity, not of authority but conviction, which is the divine authority and way of Christ's power and spirit in his people; making good his blessed promise, <Q>That he would be in the midst of his, where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world.</Q> So be it.</P>
<P>Now it may be expected I should here set down what sort of authority is exercised by this people upon such members of their society as correspond not in their lives with their profession, and that are refractory to this good and whole∣some order settled among them; and the rather, because they have not wanted their reproach and suffering from some tongues upon this occasion in a plentiful manner.</P>
<P>The power they exercise is such as Christ has given to his own people to the end of the world in the persons of his disciples; viz. "To oversee, exhort, reprove," and after long-suffering and waiting upon the disobedient and refrac∣tory, <Q>to disown them as any more of their communion, or that they will any longer stand charged in the sight and judgment of God or men with their conversation or behaviour as one of them until they repent.</Q> The sub∣ject-matter about which this authority, in any of the fore∣going branches of it, is exercised, is, first, in relation to
<PB N="xxxii" REF="037441_0031_100D8D9E1EEF2C98"/>common and general practice: and, secondly, about those things that more strictly refer to their own character and profession, and distinguish them from all other professors of christianity; avoiding two extremes upon which many split, viz. persecution and libertinism. A coercive power to whip people into the temple; that such as will not conform, though against faith and conscience, shall be punished in their persons or estates; or leaving all loose and at large as to practice, unaccountable to all but God and the magis∣trate. To which hurtful extreme nothing has more con∣tributed, than the abuse of church-power by such as suffer their passions and private interests to prevail with them to carry it to outward force and corporal punishment; a prac∣tice they have been taught to dislike by their extreme suf∣ferings, as well as their known principle for an universal liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>On the other hand they equally dislike an independency in society; an unaccountableness in practice and conversa∣tion to the terms of their own communion, and to those that are the members of it. They distinguish between imposing any practice that immediately regards faith or worship (which is never to be done, nor suffered, or submitted unto) and requiring christian compliance with those methods that only respect church-business in its more civil part and con∣cern, and that regard the discreet and orderly maintenance of the character of the society, as a sober and religious com∣munity. In short, what is for the promotion of holiness and charity, that men may practise what they profess, live up to their own principles, and not be at liberty to give the lie to their own profession without rebuke. They compel none to them, but oblige those that are of them to walk suitably, or they are denied by them: that is all the mark they set upon them, and the power they exercise, or judge a christian society can exercise upon those that are the members of it.</P>
<P>The way of their proceedings against such as have lapsed or transgressed is this. He is visited by some of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice against known and general virtue, or any branch of their particular testimony, which he, in common, professeth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal for the good of his soul, the honour of God, and reputation of their profession, to own his fault, and condemn it, in as ample a manner as the evil or scandal was given by him;
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="037441_0032_100D8DA06AEF4988"/>which for the most part, is performed by some written testi∣mony under the party's hand: and if it so happen that the party prove refractory, and is not willing to clear the truth they profess from the reproach of his or her evil-doing or unfaithfulness, they, after repeated intreaties, and due wait∣ing for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to disown such a fact, and the party offending; recording the same as a testimony of their care for the honour of the truth they profess.</P>
<P>And if he or she shall clear their profession and them∣selves, by sincere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly sorrow for so doing, they are received, and looked upon again as members of their communion. For as God, so his true people upbraid no man after repentance.</P>
<P>This is the account I had to give of the people of God called Quakers, as to their rise, appearance, principles, and practices in this age of the world, both with respect to their faith and worship, discipline and conversation. And I judge it very proper in this place, because it is to preface the journal of the first blessed and glorious instrument of this work, and for a testimony to him in his singular qualifica∣tions and services, in which he abundantly excelled in this his day, and are worthy to be set forth as an example to all succeeding times, to the glory of the Most High God, and for a just memorial to that worthy and excellent man, his faithful servant and apostle to this generation of the world.</P>
<P>I am now come to the third head or branch of my pre∣face, viz. the instrumental author. For it is natural for some to say, Well, here is the people and work, but where and who was the man, the instrument; he that in this age was sent to begin this work and people? I shall, as God shall enable me, declare who and what he was, not only by report of others, but from my own long and most inward converse and intimate knowledge of him; for which my soul blesseth God, as it hath often done; and I doubt not, but by that time I have discharged myself of this part of my preface, my serious readers will believe I had good cause so to do.</P>
<P>The blessed instrument of and in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to write, was GEORGE FOX, dis∣tinguished from another of that name, by that other's addi∣tion of younger to his name in all his writings; not that he was so in years, but that he was so in the truth; but he was also a worthy man, witness and servant of God in his time.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="037441_0033_100D8DA20913DE28"/>
But this George Fox was born in Leicestershire, about the year 1624. He descended of honest and sufficient pa∣rents, who endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the rest of their children, in the way and worship of the nation; especially his mother, who was a woman accomplished above most of her degree in the place where she lived. But from a child he appeared of another frame of mind than the rest of his brethren; being more religious, inward, still, solid, and observing, beyond his years, as the answers he would give, and the questions he would put upon occasion mani∣fested, to the astonishment of those that heard him, especially in divine things.</P>
<P>His mother taking notice of his singular temper, and the gravity, wisdom, and piety that very early shone through him, refusing childish and vain sports and company when very young, she was tender and indulgent over him, so that from her he met with little difficulty. As to his employ∣ment, he was brought up in country business; and as he took most delight in sheep, so he was very skilful in them; an employment that very well suited his mind in several respects, both for its innocency and solitude; and was a just figure of his after ministry and service.</P>
<P>I shall not break in upon his own account, which is by much the best that can be given; and therefore desire, what I can, to avoid saying any thing of what is said already, as to the particular passages of his coming forth: but, in gene∣ral, when he was somewhat above twenty, he left his friends, and visited the most retired and religious people, and some there were at that time in this nation, especially in those parts, who waited for the consolation of Israel night and day, as Zacharias, Anna, and good old Simeon did of old time. To these he was sent, and these he sought out in the neighbouring countries, and among them he sojourned till his more ample ministry came upon him.</P>
<P>At this time he taught and was an example of silence, endeavouring to bring people from self-performances, testi∣fying and turning to the light of Christ within them, and encouraging them to wait in patience to feel the power of it to stir in their hearts, that their knowledge and worship of God might stand in the power of an endless life, which was to be found in the light, as it was obeyed in the mani∣festation of it in man. <Q>For in the Word was life, and that life was the light of men.</Q> Life in the Word, light in men, and life too, as the light is obeyed; the children of
<PB N="xxxv" REF="037441_0034_100D8DA48BBBDC48"/>the light living by the life of the Word, by which the Word begets them again to God, which is the regeneration and new birth, without which there is no coming unto the king∣dom of God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than John, that is, than John's ministry, which was not that of the kingdom, but the consummation of the legal, and open∣ing of the gospel-dispensation. Accordingly, several meet∣ings were gathered in those parts; and thus his time was employed for some years.</P>
<P>In 1652, he being in his usual retirement to the Lord upon a very high mountain, in some of the hither parts of Yorkshire, as I take it, his mind exercised towards the Lord, he had a vision of the great work of God in the earth, and of the way that he was to go forth to begin it. He saw people as thick as motes in the sun, that should in time be brought home to the Lord, that there might be but one Shepherd and one sheepfold in all the earth. There his eye was directed northward, beholding a great people that should receive him and his message in those parts. Upon this mountain he was moved of the Lord to sound out his great and notable day, as if he had been in a great auditory, and from thence went north, as the Lord had shewn him: and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exercise and service shewn to him, so that the Lord was his leader indeed; for it was not in vain that he travelled, God in most places sealing his com∣mission with the convincement of some of all sorts, as well publicans as sober professors of religion. Some of the first and most eminent of them, which are at rest, were Richard Farnsworth, James Nayler, William Dewsberry, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, John Camm. John Audland, Richard Hubberthorn, T. Taylor, John Aldam, T. Holmes, Alexander Parker, William Simpson, William Caton, John Stubbs, Robert Widders, John Burnyeat, Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthouse, and many more worthies, that cannot be well here named, together with divers yet living of the first and great convincement, who after the knowledge of God's purging judgments in themselves, and some time of waiting in silence upon him, to feel and receive power from on high to speak in his name (which none else rightly can, though they may use the same words.) felt the divine mo∣tions, and were frequently drawn forth, especially to visit the publick assemblies, to reprove, inform, and exhort them, sometimes in markets, fairs, streets, and by the highway side,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="037441_0035_100D8DA69BC2EB18"/>calling people to repentance, and to turn to the Lord with their hearts as well as their mouths; directing them to the light of Christ within them, to see and examine and con∣sider their ways by, and to eschew the evil and do the good and acceptable will of God. And they suffered great hard∣ships for this their love and good-will, being often stocked, stoned, beaten, whipped, and imprisoned, though honest men and of good report where they lived, that had left wives and children, and houses and lands, to visit them with a living call to repentance. And though the priests generally set themselves to oppose them, and write against them, and insinuated most false and scandalous stories to defame them, stirring up the magistrates to suppress them, especially in those northern parts, yet God was pleased so to fill them with his living power, and give them such an open door of utterance in his service, that there was a mighty convince∣ment over those parts.</P>
<P>And through the tender and singular indulgence of Judge Bradshaw and Judge Fell, in the infancy of things, the priests were never able to gain the point they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to blood, and if possible, Herod-like, by a cruel exercise of the civil power, to have cut them off and rooted them out of the country. Espe∣cially Judge Fell, who was not only a check to their rage in the course of legal proceedings, but otherwise upon oc∣casion, and finally countenanced this people; for his wife receiving the truth with the first, it had that influence upon his spirit, being a just and wise man, and seeing in his own wise and family a full confutation of all the popular cla∣mours against the way of truth, that he covered them what he could, and freely opened his doors, and gave up his house to his wife and her friends, not valuing the reproach of ignorant or evil-minded people, which I here mention to his and her honour, and which will be I believe an honour and a blessing to such of their name and family as shall be found in that tenderness, humility, love, and zeal for the truth and people of the Lord.</P>
<P>That house was for some years at first, till the truth had opened its way in the southern parts of this island, an emi∣nent receptacle of this people. Others of good note and substance in those northern countries had also opened their houses with their hearts to the many publishers, that in a short time the Lord had raised to declare his salvation to the people, and where meetings of the Lord's messengers
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="037441_0036_100D8DA8F3F423F0"/>were frequently held, to communicate their services and exercises, and comfort and edify one another in their blessed ministry.</P>
<P>But lest this may be thought a digression, having touched upon this before, I return to this excellent man: and for his personal qualities, both natural, moral, and divine, as they appeared in his converse with his brethren and in the church of God, take as follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. He was a man that God endowed with a clear and wonderful depth, a discerner of others spirits, and very much a master of his own. And though the side of his under standing which lay next to the world, and especially the expression of it, might found uncouth and unfashionable to nice ears, his matter was nevertheless very profound, and would not only bear to be often considered, but the more i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was so, the more weighty and instructing it appeared. And as abruptly and brokenly as sometimes his sentences would fall from him about divine things, it is well known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations. And indeed it shewed beyond all contradiction that God sent him, that no arts or parts had any share in the matter or manner of his ministry, and that so many great, excellent, and neces∣sary truths as he came forth to preach to mankind, had there∣fore nothing of man's wit or wisdom to recommend them. So that as to man he was an original, being no man's copy. And his ministry and writings shew they are from one that was not taught of man, nor had learned what he said by study. Nor were they notional or speculative, but sensible and practical truths, tending to conversion and regeneration, and the setting up the kingdom of God in the hearts of men, and the way of it was his work. So that I have many times been overcome in myself, and been made to say with my Lord and Master upon the like occasion, <Q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent of this world, and revealed them to babes;</Q> for many times hath my soul bowed in an humble thankfulness to the Lord, that he did not choose any of the wise and learned of this world to be the first messenger in our age of his blessed truth to men; but that he took one that was not of high degree, or elegant speech, or learned after the way of this world, that his mes∣sage and work he sent him to do might come with less sus∣picion or jealousy of human wisdom and interest, and with more force and clearness upon the consciences of those that
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="037441_0037_100D8DAB0AF45240"/>sincerely sought the way of truth in the love of it. I say, beholding with the eye of my mind, which the God of hea∣ven had opened in me, the marks of God's finger and hand visibly in this testimony from the clearness of the principle, the power and efficacy of it in the exemplary sobriety, plainness, zeal, steadiness, humility, gravity, punctuality, charity, and circumspect care in the government of church∣affairs, which shined in his and their life and testimony that God employed in this work, it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged my soul in a deep love, fear, reverence, and thanksulness for his love and mercy therein to mankind; in which mind I remain, and shall, I hope, to the end of my days.</P>
<P N="2">II. In his testimony or ministry he much laboured to open truth to the people's understandings, and to bottom them upon the principle and principal, Christ Jesus, the light of the world, that by bringing them to something that was of God in themselves, they might the better know and judge of him and themselves.</P>
<P>He had an extraordinary gift in opening the scriptures. He would go to the marrow of things, and shew the mind, harmony, and fulfilling of them with much plainness, and to great comfort and edification.</P>
<P>The mystery of the first and second Adam, of the fall and restoration, of the law and gospel, of shadows and substance, of the servant and son's state, and the fulsilling of the scriptures in Christ, and by Christ the true light, in all that are his, through the obedience of faith, were much of the substance and drift of his testimonies. In all which he was witnessed to be of God, being sensibly felt to speak that which he had received of Christ, and was his own ex∣perience in that which never errs nor fails.</P>
<P>But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness and weight of his spirit, the reverence and solemnity of his address and behaviour, and the fewness and fulness of his words, have often struck even strangers with admiration, as they used to reach others with consolation. The most awful, living, reverent frame I ever felt or beheld, I must say, was his in prayer. And truly it was a testimony he knew, and lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they that know him most will see most reason to approach him with reverence and fear.</P>
<P>He was of an innocent life, no busy-body, nor self-seeker, neither touchy nor critical: what fell from him was very in∣offensive,
<PB N="xxxix" REF="037441_0038_100D8DAD2170CA80"/>if not very edifying. So meek, contented, mo∣dest, easy, steady, tender, it was a pleasure to be in his company. He exercised no authority but over evil, and that every-where and in all; but with love, compassion, and long-suffering. A most merciful man, as ready to forgive as unapt to take or give an offence. Thousands can truly say, he was of an excellent spirit and favour among them, and because thereof the most excellent spirits loved him with an unfeigned and unfading love.</P>
<P>He was an incessant labourer; for in his younger time, before his many great and deep sufferings and travels had enfeebled his body for intinerant services, he laboured much in the word and doctrine and discipline in England, Scotland, and Ireland, turning many to God, and confirming those that were convinced of the truth, and settling good order as to church-affairs among them. And towards the conclusion of his travelling services, between the years seventy-one and seventy-seven, he visited the churches of Christ in the plant∣ations in America, and in the United Provinces, and Ger∣many, as his following Journal relates, to the convincement and consolation of many. After that time he chiefly resi∣ded in and about the city of London, and besides the services of his ministry, which were frequent, he wrote much both to them that are within and those that are without the com∣munion. But the care he took of the affairs of the church in general was very great.</P>
<P>He was often where the records of the affairs of the church are kept, and the letters from the many meetings of God's people over all the world, where settled, come upon occa∣sions; which letters he had read to him, and communicated them to the meeting that is weekly held there for such ser∣vices; he would be sure to stir them up to discharge them, especially in suffering cases: shewing great sympathy and compassion upon all such occasions, carefully looking into the respective cases, and endeavouring speedy relief accord∣ing to the nature of them; so that the churches and any of the suffering members thereof were sure not to be forgotten or delayed in their desires if he were there.</P>
<P>As he was unwearied, so he was undaunted in his services for God and his people; he was no more to be moved to fear than to wrath. His behaviour at Derby, Litchfield, Appleby, before Oliver Cromwell at Lanceston, Scarbo∣rough, Worcester, and Westminster-hall, with many other
<PB N="xl" REF="037441_0039_100D8DAF4F894F68"/>places and exercises, did abundantly evidence it to his ene∣mies as well as his friends.</P>
<P>But as in the primitive times some rose up against the blessed apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, even from among those that they had turned to the hope of the gospel, and who became their greatest trouble, so this man of God had his share of suffering from some that were convinced by him, who through prejudice or mistake ran against him as one that sought dominion over conscience; because he pressed, by his presence or epistles, a ready and zealous compliance with such good and wholesome things as tended to an order∣ly conversation about the assairs of the church, and in their walking before men. That which contributed much to this ill work, was in some a begrudging of this meek man the love and esteem he had and deserved in the hearts of the peo∣ple, and weakness in others that were taken with their ground∣less suggestions of imposition and blind obedience.</P>
<P>They would have had every man independent, that as he had the principle in himself, he should only stand and fall to that and nobody else; not considering that the principle is one in all, and though the measure of light or grace might differ, yet the nature of it was the same, and being so they struck at the spiritual unity, which a people guided by the same principle are naturally led into: so that what is evil to one is so to all, and what is virtuous, honest, and of good report to one, is so to all, from the sense and savour of the one universal principle which is common to all, and (which the disaffected profess to be) the root of all true christian fellowship, and that spirit into which the people of God drink, and come to be spiritually minded, and of one heart and one soul.</P>
<P>Some weakly mistook good order in the government of church-affairs for discipline in worship, and that it was so pressed or recommended by him and other brethren: and they were ready to reflect the same things that dissenters had very reasonably objected upon the national churches, that have coercively pressed conformity to their respective creeds and worships: whereas these things related wholly to con∣versation, and the outward and (as I may say) civil part of the church, that men should walk up to the principles of their belief, and not be wanting in care and charity. But though some have stumbled and fallen through mistakes and an unreasonable obstinacy even to a prejudice, yet blessed be God, the generality have returned to their first love, and
<PB N="xli" REF="037441_0040_100D8DB0EDF6EFF0"/>seen the work of the enemy, that loses no opportunity or advantage by which he may check or hinder the work of God, and disquiet the peace of his church, and chill the love of his people to the truth, and one to another; and there is hope of divers that are yet at a distance.</P>
<P>In all these occasions, though there was no person the discontented struck so sharply at as this good man, he bore all their weakness and prejudice, and returned not reflection for reflection: but forgave them their weak and bitter speech∣es, praying for them that they might have a sense of their hurt, and see the subtilty of the enemy to rend and divide, and return into their first love that thought no ill.</P>
<P>And truly, I must say, that though God had visibly cloathed him with a divine preference and authority, and indeed his very presence expressed a religious majesty, yet he never abused it, but held his place in the church of God with great meekness, and a most engaging humility and moderation. For upon all occasions, like his blessed Master, he was a servant to all, holding and exercising his eldership in the invisible power that had gathered them, with reve∣rence to the head and care over the body, and was received only in that spirit and power of Christ, as the first and chief elder in this age; who as he was therefore worthy of double honour, so for the same reason it was given by the faithful of this day; because his authority was inward and not out∣ward, and that he got it and kept it by the love of God and power of an endless life. I write my knowledge and not report, and my witness is true, having been with him for weeks and months together on divers occasions, and those of the nearest and most exercising nature, and that by night and by day, by sea and by land, in this and in foreign countries: and I can say I never saw him out of his place, or not a match for every service or occasion.</P>
<P>For in all things he acquitted himself like a man, yea a strong man, a new and heavenly-minded man. A divine, and a naturalist, and all of God Almighty's making. I have been surprized at his questions and answers in natural things, that whilst he was ignorant of useless and sophisti∣cal science, he had in him the foundation of useful and commendable knowledge, and cherished it every-where. Civil beyond all forms of breeding in his behaviour; very temperate, eating little and sleeping less, though a bulky person.</P>
<P>Thus he lived and sojourned among us, and as he lived
<PB N="xlii" REF="037441_0041_100D8DB4327ACE48"/>so he died, feeling the same eternal power that had raised and preserved him in his last moments. So full of assurance was he that he triumphed over death; and so even to the last, as if death were hardly worth notice or a mention: re∣commending to some with him the dispatch and dispersion of an epistle, just before written to the churches of Christ, throughout the world, and his own books; but above all, friends, and of all friends those in Ireland and America, twice over: saying, Mind poor friends in Ireland and America.</P>
<P>And to some that came in and inquired how he found himself, he answered, <Q>Never heed, the Lord's power is over all weakness and death, the Seed reigns, blessed be the Lord:</Q> which was about four or five hours before his departure out of this world. He was at the great meeting near Lombard-street on the first day of the week, and it was the third following about ten at night when he left us, being at the house of H. Goldney in the same court. In a good old age he went, after having lived to see his childrens children to several generations in the truth. He had the comfort of a short illness, and the blessing of a clear sense to the last; and we may truly say with a man of God of old, that "being dead, he yet speaketh;" and though absent in body, he is present in Spirit; neither time nor place being able to in∣terrupt the communion of saints, or dissolve the fellowship of the spirits of the just. His works praise him, because they are to the praise of him that worked by him; for which his memorial is and shall be blessed. I have done, as to this part of my preface, when I have left this short epitaph to his name: <Q>Many sons have done virtuously in this day, but, dear GEORGE, thou excellest them all.</Q></P>
<P>And now, Friends, you that profess to walk in the way this blessed man was sent of God to turn us into, suffer I beseech you the word of exhortation, as well fathers as children, and elders as young men. The glory of this day, and foundation of the hope that has not made us ashamed since we were a people, you know is that blessed principle of light and life of Christ, which we profess, and direct all people to, as the great instrument and agent of man's con∣version to God: it was by this we were first touched, and effectually enlightened, as to our inward state; which put us upon the consideration of our latter end, causing us to set the Lord before our eyes, and to number our days, that we might apply our hearts to wisdom. In that day we
<PB N="xliii" REF="037441_0042_100D8DB5CFBAEE88"/>judged not after the sight of the eye, or after the hearing of the ear, but according to the light and sense this blessed principle gave us; we judged and acted in reference to Things and Persons, ourselves and others, yea, towards God our Maker. For being quickened by it in our inward man, we could easily discern the difference of things, and feel what was right, and what was wrong, and what was fit, and what not, both in reference to religion and civil con∣cerns. That being the ground of the fellowship of all saints, it was in that our fellowship stood. In this we desired to have a sense one of another, acted towards one another and all me, in love, faithfulness, and fear.</P>
<P>In the feeling of the motions of this principle we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it, that we might feel those drawings and movings, before we approach∣ed the Lord in prayer, or opened our mouths in ministry. And in our beginning and ending with this, stood our com∣fort, service, and edification. And as we ran faster, or fell short, we made burthens for ourselves to bear; our services finding in ourselves a rebuke, instead of an acceptance; and in lieu of "Well done," <Q>Who hath required this at your hands?</Q> In that day we were an exercised people, our very countenances and deportment declared it.</P>
<P>Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for ourselves, especially the young convinced. Often had we the burthen of the word of the Lord to our neighbours, relations, and acquaintance, and sometimes strangers also: we were in travail for one another's preservation; not seek∣ing, but shunning occasions of any coldness or misunder∣standing, treating one another as those that believed and felt God present; which kept our conversation innocent, serious, and weighty, guarding ourselves against the cares and friend∣ships of the world. We held the truth in the Spirit of it, and not in our own spirits, or after our own will and af∣fections. They were bowed and brought into subjection, in∣somuch that it was visible to them that knew us, we did not think ourselves at our own disposal, to go where we list, or say or do what we list, or when we list. Our liberty stood in the liberty of the Spirit of truth; and no pleasure, no prosit, no fear, no favour could draw us from this retired, strict, and watchful srame. We were so far from seeking occasions of company, that we avoided them what we could, pursuing our own business with moderation, instead of meddling with other people's unnecessarily.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="037441_0043_100D8DB7F894F858"/>
Our words were few and savoury, our looks composed and weighty, and our whole deportment very observable. True it is, that this retired and strict sort of life from the liberty of the conversation of the world, exposed us to the censures of many, as humourists, conceited, and self-righte∣ous persons, &amp;c. But it was our preservation from many snares, to which others were continually exposed by the pre∣valency of the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, that wanted no occasions or temptations to ex∣cite them abroad in the converse of the world.</P>
<P>I cannot forget the humility and chaste zeal of that day. O how constant at meetings, how retired in them, how firm to truth's life, as well as truth's principles, and how intire and united in oar communion, as indeed became those that profess one head, even Christ Jesus the Lord!</P>
<P>This being the testimony and example the man of God before-mentioned was sent to declare and leave amongst us, and we having embraced the same as the merciful visitation of God to us, the word of exhortation at this time is, that we continue to be found in the way of this testimony with all zeal and integrity, and so much the more by how much the day draweth near.</P>
<P>And first, as to you, my beloved and much honoured brethren in Christ that are in the exercise of the ministry: O feel life in the ministry! Let life be your commission, your well-spring and treasury in all such occasions; else you well know there can be no begetting to God, since no∣thing can quicken or make people alive to God, but the life of God: and it must be a ministry in and from life that en∣livens any people to God. We have seen the fruit of all other ministries by the few that are turned from the evil of their ways. It is not our parts or memory, the repetition of former openings in our own will and time, that will do God's work. A dry doctrinal ministry, however sound in words, can reach but the ear, and is but a dream at the best: there is another soundness, that is soundest of all, viz. Christ the power of God. This is the key of David, that opens, and none shuts; and shuts, and none can open; as the oil to the lamp and the soul to the body, so is that to the best of words. Which made Christ to say, <Q>My words they are spirit, and they are life;</Q> that is, they are from life, and therefore they make you alive that receive them. If the disciples, that had lived with Jesus, were to stay at Jerusalem till they received it; so must we wait to receive
<PB N="xlv" REF="037441_0044_100D8DB9D183D360"/>before we minister, if we will turn people from darkness to light, and from Satan's power to God.</P>
<P>I fervently bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may always be like-minded, that you may ever wait reverently for the coming and open∣ing of the word of life, and attend upon it in your ministry and service, that you may serve God in his Spirit. And be it little, or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much, and the least is enough, if from the motion of God's Spirit; and without it, verily, never so little is too much, because to no profit.</P>
<P>For it is the Spirit of the Lord immediately, or through the ministry of his servants, that teacheth his people to profit; and to be sure, so far as we take him along with us in our services, so far are we profitable, and no farther. For if it be the Lord that must work all things in us, and for our∣selves, much more is it the Lord that must work in us for the conversion of others. If therefore it was once a cross to us to speak, though the Lord required it at our hands, let it never be so to be silent, when he does not.</P>
<P>It is one of the most dreadful sayings in the Revela∣tions, That he that adds to the words of the prophecy of this book, God will add the plagues written in this book. To keep back the counsel of God, is as terrible; for he that takes away from the words of the prophecy of this book, God shall take away his part out of the book of life. And truly it has great caution in it to those that use the name of the Lord, to be well assured the Lord speaks, that they may not be found of the number of those that add to the words of the testimony of prophecy which the Lord giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or diminish the same, both being so very offensive to God.</P>
<P>Wherefore, brethren, let us be careful neither to out-go our guide, nor yet loiter behind him; since he that makes haste may miss his way, and he that stays behind lose his guide: for even those that have received the word of the Lord had need wait for wisdom, that they may see how to divide the word aright; which plainly implieth, that it is possible for one that hath received the word of the Lord to miss in the division and application of it, which must come from an impatiency of spirit, and a self-working; which makes an unsound and dangerous mixture, and will hardly beget a right-minded living people to God.</P>
<P>I am earnest in this, above all other considerations, as
<PB N="xlvi" REF="037441_0045_100D8DBC49D78030"/>to publick brethren, well knowing how much it concerns the present and future state and preservation of the church of Christ Jesus, that has been gathered and built up by a living and powerful ministry, that the ministry be held, pre∣served, and continued in the manifestations, motions, and supplies of the same life and power from time to time.</P>
<P>And where-ever it is observed that any one does minister more from gifts and parts than life and power, though they have an enlightened and doctrinal understanding, let them in time be advised and admonished for their preservation; because insensibly such will come to depend upon self-suffi∣ciency, to forsake Christ the living fountain, and to hew out unto themselves cisterns that will hold no living waters, and by degrees draw others from waiting upon the gift of God in themselves, and to feel it in others, in order to their strength and refreshment, to wait upon them, and to turn from God to man again, and so to make shipwreck of the faith once delivered to the Saints, and of a good conscience towards God; which are only kept by that divine gift of life that begat the one and wakened and sanctified the other in the beginning.</P>
<P>Nor is it enough that we have known the divine gift, and in it have reached to the spirits in prison, and been the in∣struments of the convincing of others of the way of God, if we keep not as low and poor in ourselves, and as depend∣ing upon the Lord as ever; since no memory, no repetitions of former openings, revelations, or enjoyments will bring a soul to God, or afford bread to the hungry, or water to the thirsty, unless life go with what we say, and that must be waited for.</P>
<P>O that we may have no other fountain, treafury, or de∣pendance! that none may presume at any rate to act of themselves for God; because they have long acted from God; that we may not supply want of waiting with our own wisdom, or think that we may take less care and more liberty in speaking than formerly; and that where we do not feel the Lord by his power to open us and enlarge us, what∣ever be the expectation of the people or has been our cus∣tomary supply and character, we may not exceed or sill up the time with our own.</P>
<P>I hope we shall ever remember who it was that said, "Of yourselves ye can do nothing;" our sufficiency is in Him: and if we are not to speak our own words, or take thought what we should say to men in our defence when
<PB N="xlvii" REF="037441_0046_100D8DBF4017D590"/>exposed for our testimony, surely we ought to speak none of our own words, or take thought what we shall say in our testimony and ministry in the name of the Lord to the souls of the people; for then of all times, and of all other occa∣sions, should it be fulfilled in us; <Q>for it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of my Father that speaketh in you.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed the ministry of the Spirit must and does keep its analogy and agreement with the birth of the Spirit; that as no man can inherit the kingdom of God unless he be born of the Spirit, so no ministry can beget a soul to God, but that which is from the Spirit. For this, as I said before, the disciples waited before they went forth, and in this our elder brethren, and messengers of God in our day, waited, visited, and reached to us. And having begun in the Spi∣rit, let none ever hope or seek to be made perfect in the flesh: for what is the flesh to the spirit, or the chaff to the wheat? And if we keep in the spirit, we shall keep in the unity of it, which is the ground of true fellowship. For by drinking into that one Spirit, we are made one people to God, and by it we are continued in the unity of the faith and the bond of peace. No envying, no bitterness, no strife can have place with us. We shall watch always for good, and not for evil over one another, and rejoice exceed∣ingly, and not begrudge at one another's increase in the riches of the grace with which God replenisheth his faithful servants.</P>
<P>And, brethren, as to you is committed the dispensation of the oracles of God, which give you frequent opportunities and great place with the people among whom you travel, I beseech you that you would not think it sufficient to declare the word of life in their assemblies, however edifying and comfortable such opportunities may be to you and them; but as was the practice of the man of God before-mentioned in great measure, when among us, inquire the state of the several churches you visit, who among them are afflicted or sick, who are tempted, if any are unfaithful or obstimate, and endeavour to issue those things in the wisdom and power of God, which will be a glorious crown upon your ministry. As that prepares your way in the hearts of the people to re∣ceive you as men of God, so it gives you credit with them to do them good by your advice in other respects. The afflicted will be comforted by you, the tempted strengthen∣ed, the sick refreshed, the unfaithful convicted and restored, and such as are obstinate softened and sitted for reconcilia∣tion
<PB N="xlviii" REF="037441_0047_100D8DC0D3FED5E0"/>which is clenching the nail, and applying and fastening the general testimony by that particular care of the several branches of it, in reference to them more immediately con∣cerned in it.</P>
<P>For though good and wise men and elders too may re∣side in such places, who are of worth and importance in the general and in other places, yet it does not always follow that they may have the room they deserve in the hearts of the people they live among, or some particular occasion may make it unfit for him or them to use that authority; but you that travel as God's messengers, if they receive you in the greater, shall they refuse you in the less? And if they own the general testimony, can they withstand the particular application of it in their own cases? Thus ye will shew yourselves workmen indeed, and carry your busi∣ness before you, to the praise of his name that hath called you from darkness to light, that you might turn others from Satan's power unto God and his kingdom which is within. And oh! that there were more of such faithful labourers in the vineyard of the Lord! never more need since the day of God!</P>
<P>Wherefore I cannot but cry and call aloud to you, that have been long professors of the truth, and know the truth in the convincing power of it, and have had a sober con∣versation among men, yet content yourselves only to know truth for yourselves; to go to meetings, and exercise an or∣dinary charity in the church and an honest behaviour in the world, and limit yourselves within those bounds, feeling little or no concern upon your spirits for the glory of the Lord in the prosperity of his truth in the earth, more than to be glad that others succeed in such service; arise ye in the name and power of the Lord Jesus! behold how white the fields are unto harvest in this and other nations, and how few able and faithful labourers there are to work therein! your country folks, neighbours, and kindred want to know the Lord and his truth, and to walk in it. Does nothing lie at your door upon their account? Search and see, and lose no time, I beseech you, for the Lord is at hand. I do not judge you; there is one that judgeth all men, and his judgment is true: you have mightily increased in your out∣ward substance, may you equally increase in your inward riches, and do good with both while you have a day to do good. Your enemies would once have taken what you had from you for his name's take in whom you have believed,
<PB N="xlix" REF="037441_0048_100D8DC292F90288"/>wherefore he has given you much of the world in the face of your enemies. But oh! let it be your servant and not your master, your diversion rather than your business! let the Lord be chiefly in your eye, and ponder your ways, and see if God has nothing more for you to do; and if you find yourselves short in your account with him, then wait for his preparation, and be ready to receive the word of command, and be not weary of well-doing when you have put your hand to the plough; and assuredly you shall reap, if you faint not, the fruit of your heavenly labour in God's everlasting kingdom.</P>
<P>And you, young convinced ones, be you intreated and exhorted to a diligent and chaste waiting upon God in the way of his blessed manifestation and appearance of himself to you. Look not out but within; let not another's liberty be your snare: neither act by imitation, but sense and feel∣ing of God's power in yourselves: crush not the tender bud∣dings of it in your souls, nor over-run in your desires and your warmness of affections the holy and gentle motions of it. Remember it is a still voice that speaks to us in this day, and that it is not to be heard in the noises and hurries of the mind, but is distinctly understood in a retired frame. Jesus loved and chose out solitudes, often going to moun∣tains, to gardens, and sea-sides, to avoid crowds and hur∣ries, to shew his disciples it was good to be solitary and sit loose to the world. Two enemies lie near your state, Ima∣gination and Liberty; but the plain, practical, living, holy truth, that has convinced you will preserve you, if you mind it in yourselves, and bring all thoughts, imaginations, and affections to the test of it, to see if they are wrought in God, or of the enemy, or your own selves: so will a true taste, discerning, and judgment be preserved to you, of what you should do and leave undone: and in your dili∣gence and faithfulness in this way you will come to inherit substance, and Christ, the eternal wisdom, will fill your treasury. And when you are converted, as well as convin∣ced, then confirm your brethren, and be ready to every good word and work that the Lord shall call you to, that you may be to his praise who has chosen you to be partakers with the Saints in light of a kingdom that cannot be shaken, an inheritance incorruptible, in eternal habitations.</P>
<P>And now, as for you that are the children of God's peo∣ple, a great concern is upon my spirit for your good, and often are my knees bowed to the God of your fathers for
<PB N="l" REF="037441_0049_100D8DC5CF05DB10"/>you, that you may come to be partakers of the same divine life and power, that has been the glory of this day, that a generation you may be to God, a holy nation and a pecu∣liar people, zealous of good works, when all our heads are laid in the dust. Oh! you young men and women, let it not suffice you that you are the children of the people of the Lord! you must also be born again if you will inherit the kingdom of God! Your fathers are but such after the flesh, and could but beget you into the likeness of the first Adam; but you must be begotten into the likeness of the second Adam by a spiritual generation. And therefore look carefully about you, O ye children of the children of God, consider your standing, and see what you are in relation to this divine kindred, family, and birth! Have you obeyed the light, and received and walked in the Spirit, that is the incorruptible seed of the word and kingdom of God, of which you must be born again? God is no respecter of persons: the father cannot save or answer for the child, the child for the father, <Q>but in the sin thou sinnest thou shalt die, and in the righteousness thou doest through Christ Jesus thou shalt live;</Q> for it is the willing and obedient that shall eat the good of the land.</P>
<P>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, such as all nations and people sow, such shall they reap at the hand of the just God. And then your many and great privileges above the children of other people will add weight in the scale against you, if you choose not the way of the Lord; for you have had line upon line, and precept upon precept, and not only good doctrine but good example; and which is more, you have been turned to and acquainted with a principle in yourselves which others have been ignorant of, and you know you may be as good as you please, without the fear of frowns and blows, or being turned out of doors, and for∣saken of father and mother for God's sake and his holy re∣ligion, as has been the case of some of your fathers in the day they first entered into this holy path: and if you, after hearing and seeing the wonders that God has wrought in the deliverance and preservation of them through a sea of troubles, and the manifold temporal as well as spiritual blessings that he has filled them with in the sight of their enemies. should neglect or turn your backs upon so great and so near a salvation, you would not only be most un∣grateful children to God and them, but must expect that God will call the children of those that know him not to
<PB N="li" REF="037441_0050_100D8DC7F7750580"/>take the crown out of your hands, and that your lot will be a dreadful judgment at the hand of the Lord. But oh! that it may never be so with any of you! The Lord forbid, saith my soul.</P>
<P>Wherefore, O ye young men and women, look to the rock of your fathers; choose the God of your fathers: there is no other God but him, no other light but his, no other grace but his, nor Spirit but his to convince you, quicken and comfort you, to lead, guide, and preserve you to God's everlasting kingdom; so will you be possessors as well as professors of the truth, embracing it not only by education but judgment and conviction, from a sense begotten in your souls through the operation of the eternal Spirit and power of God in your hearts, by which you may come to be the seed of Abraham through faith, and the circumcision not made with hands, and so heirs of the promise made to the fathers of an incorruptible crown: that, as I said before, a generation you may be to God, holding up the profession of the blessed truth in the life and power of it. For forma∣lity in religion is nauseous to God and good men; and the more so, where any form or appearance has been new and peculiar, and begun and practised upon a principle with an uncommon zeal and strictness. Therefore, I say, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profession without that salt and savour by which it is come to obtain a good report among men, is not to answer God's love, nor your parents care, nor the mind of truth in yourselves, nor in those that are without; who though they will not obey the truth, have sight and sense enough to see if they do that make a profession of it. For where the divine virtue of it is not felt in the soul, and waited for, and lived in, imperfec∣tions will quickly break out, and shew themselves, and de∣tect the unfaithfulness of such persons, and that their insides are not seasoned with the nature of that holy principle which they profess.</P>
<P>Wherefore, dear children, let me intreat you to shut your eyes at the temptations and allurements of this low and pe∣rishing world, and not suffer your affections to be capti∣vated by those lusts and vanities that your fathers, for truth's sake, long since turned their backs upon: but as you be∣lieve it to be the truth, receive it into your hearts, that you may become the children of God: so that it may never be said of you as the evangelist writes of the Jews of his time, that Christ the true light came to his own, but his own re∣ceived
<PB N="lii" REF="037441_0051_100D8DC9936B8AD8"/>him not; but to as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the <Q>children of God; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</Q> A most close and com∣prehensive passage to this occasion: you exactly and pecu∣liarly answer to those professing Jews, in that you bear the name of God's people, by being the children and wearing the form of God's people: so that he by his light in you may be said to come to his own, and if you obey it not, but turn your back upon it, and walk after the vanities of your minds, you will be of those that receive him not, which I pray God may never be your case and judgment; but that you may be thoroughly sensible of the many and great obligations you lie under to the Lord for his love, and your parents for their care; and with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your strength, turn to the Lord, to his gift and Spirit in you, and hear his voice and obey it, that you may seal to the testimony of your fathers by the truth and evidence of your own experience; that your childrens children may bless you, and the Lord for you, as those that delivered a faithful example, as well as record of the truth of God unto them. So will the grey hairs of your dear parents yet alive go down to the grave with joy, to see you the posterity of truth, as well as theirs, and that not only their natures but Spirit shall live in you when they are gone.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this preface with a few words to those that are not of our communion, into whose hands this may come, especially those of our own nation.</P>
<P>Friends, as you are the sons and daughters of Adam, and my brethren after the flesh, often and earnest have been my desires and prayers to God on your behalf, that you may come to know him that has made you to be your Redeemer and Restorer to the image, that through sin you have lost, by the power and Spirit of his Son Jesus Christ, whom he hath given for the light and life of the world. And O that you, who are called Christians, would receive him into your heart! for there it is you want him, and at that door he stands knocking, that you should let him in, but you do not open him; you are full of other guests, so that a manger is his lot among you now, as well as of old; yet you are full of profession, as were the Jews when he came among them, who knew him not, but rejected and
<PB N="liii" REF="037441_0052_100D8DCB35DA25E8"/>evilly intreated him. So that if you come not to the pos∣session and experience of what you profess, all your forma∣lity in religion will stand you in no stead in the day of God's judgment.</P>
<P>I beseech you ponder with yourselves your eternal con∣dition, and see what title, what ground and foundation, you have for your christianity: if more than a profession, and an historical belief of the gospel. Have you known the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, and the fan of Christ that winnows away the chaff, the carnal lusts and af∣fections? That divine leaven of the kingdom, that, being received, leavens the whole lump of man, sanctifying him throughout in body, soul, and spirit? If this be not the ground of your confidence, you are in a miserable estate.</P>
<P>You will say, perhaps, that though you are sinners, and live in the daily commission of sin, and are not sanctified, as I have been speaking, yet you have faith in Christ, who has borne the curse for you, and in him you are complete by faith; his righteousness being imputed to you.</P>
<P>But my friends, let me intreat you not to deceive your∣selves in so important a point as is that of your immortal souls. If you have true faith in Christ, your faith will make you clean, it will sanctify you; for the saints faith was their victory: by this they overcame sin within and sinful men without. And if thou art in Christ, thou walk∣est not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, whose fruits are manifest. Yea thou art a new creature, new made, new fa∣shioned after God's will and mould: old things are done away, and behold all things are become new: new love, desires, will, affections, and practices. It is not any longer thou that livest, thou disobedient, carnal, worldly one; but it is Christ liveth in thee, and to live is Christ, and to die is thy eternal gain; because thou art assured, "That thy corruptible shall put on incorruption, and thy mortal im∣mortality;" and that thou hast a glorious house eternal in the heavens, that will never wax old or pass away. All this follows being in Christ, as the sensation of heat follows fire, and light the sun.</P>
<P>Therefore have a care how you presume to rely upon such a notion, as that you are in Christ whilst in your old fallen nature. For "what communion hath light with dark∣ness, or Christ with Belial?" Hear what the beloved disci∣ple tells you; "If we say we have fellowship with God, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth." That is,
<PB N="liv" REF="037441_0053_100D8DCD5A25D900"/>if we go on in a sinful way, are captivated by our carnal affections, and are not converted to God, we walk in dark∣ness, and cannot possibly have any fellowship with God. Christ cloaths them with his righteousness, that receive his grace in their hearts, and deny themselves, and take up his cross daily, and follow him. Christ's righteousness makes men inwardly holy, of holy minds, wills, and practices. It is nevertheless Christ's because we have it; for it is ours not by nature, but by faith and adoption: it is the gift of God: but still, though not ours as of or from ourselves, for in that sense it is Christ's, for it is of and from him, yet it is ours, and must be ours in possession, efficacy, and en∣joyment, to do us any good, or Christ's righteousness will profit us nothing. It was after this manner that he was made to the primitive Christians, righteousness, sanctifica∣tion, justification, and redemption; and if ever you will have the comfort, kernel, and marrow of the christian reli∣gion, thus you must come to learn and obtain it.</P>
<P>Now my friends, by what you have read, and will read in what follows, you may perceive that God has visited a poor people among you with this saving knowledge and tes∣timony; whom he has upheld and increased to this day, notwithstanding the fierce opposition they have met withal. Despise not the meanness of this appearance: It was, and yet is, we know, a day of small things, and of small ac∣count with too many; and many hard and ill names are given to it; but it is of God, it came from him, because it leads to him. This we know, but we cannot make another know it as we know it, unless he will take the same way to know it that we took. The world talks of God; but what do they do? They pray for power, but reject the principle in which it is. If you would know God, and worship and serve God as you should do, you must come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpose. Some seek it in books, some in learned men; but what they look for is in themselves, yet they overlook it. The voice is too still, the seed too sinall, and the light shineth in darkness. They are abroad, and so cannot divide the spoil; but the woman, that lost her silver, found it at home, after she had lighted her candle and swept her house. Do you so too, and you shall find what Pilate wanted to know, viz. truth.</P>
<P>The light of Christ within, who is the light of the world, and so a light to you, that tells you the truth of your con∣dition, leads all that take heed unto it out of darkness into
<PB N="lv" REF="037441_0054_100D8DD024E3E4B8"/>God's marvellous light; for light grows upon the obedient. It is sown for the righteous, and their way is a shining light, that shines forth more and more to the perfect day.</P>
<P>Wherefore, O friends, turn in, turn in, I beseech you! Where is the poison, there is the antidote: there you want Christ, and there you must find him; and blessed be God, there you may find him. "Seek and you shall find," I testify for God: but then you must seek aright with your whole heart, as men that seek for their lives, yea, for their eternal lives: diligently, humbly, patiently, as those that can taste no pleasure, comfort, or satisfaction in any thing else, unless you find him whom your souls want, and desire to know and love above all. O it is a travel, a spiritual travel! let the carnal profane world think and say as it will. And through this path you must walk to the city of God, that has eternal foundations, if ever you will come there.</P>
<P>Well! and what does this blessed light do for you? Why, 1. It sets all your sins in order before you: it detects the spirit of this world in all its baits and allurements, and shows how man came to fall from God, and the fallen estate he is in. 2. It begets a sense and sorrow, in such as believe in it, for this fearful lapse. You will then see him distinctly whom you have pierced, and all the blows and wounds you have given him by your disobedience; and how you have made him to serve with your sins, and you will weep and mourn for it, and your sorrow will be a godly sorrow. 3. After this it will bring you to the holy watch, to take care that you do so no more, that the enemy surprise you not again: then thoughts, as well as words and works, will come to judgment, which is the way of holiness, in which the redeemed of the Lord do walk. Here you will come to love God above all, and your neighbours as yourselves. Nothing hurts, nothing harms, nothing makes afraid on this holy mountain: now you come to be Christ's indeed, for you are his in nature and spirit, and not your own. And when you are thus Christ's, then Christ is your's, and not before: and here communion with the Father and with the Son you will know, and the efficacy of the blood of cleans∣ing, even the blood of Jesus Christ, that immaculate Lamb, which speaketh better things than the blood of Abel, and which cleanseth from all sin the consciences of those that, through the living Faith, come to be sprinkled with it from dead works to serve the living God.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="037441_0055_100D8DD1BA009260"/>
To conclude, Behold the testimony and doctrine of the people called Quakers! Behold their Practice and Disci∣pline! And behold the blessed man and men that were sent of God in this excellent work and service! All which will be more particularly expressed in the ensuing annals of the man of God; which I do heartily recommend to my read∣er's most serious perusal, and beseech Almighty God that his blessing may go along with it, to the convincing of many as yet strangers to this holy dispensation, and also to the edification of the church of God in general: who, for his manifold and repeated mercies and blessings to his people, in this day of his great love, is ever worthy to have the glo∣ry, honour, thanksgiving, and renown; and be it rendered and ascribed, with fear and reverence, through him in whom he is well pleased, his beloved Son and Lamb, our light and life, that sits with him upon the throne, world without end. Amen,</P>
<P>Says one whom God has long since mercifully favoured with his fatherly visitation, and who was not disobe∣dient to the heavenly vision and call; to whom the way of truth is more lovely and precious than ever, and that knowing the beauty and benefit of it above all worldly treasure, has chosen it for his chiefest joy, and therefore recommends it to thy love and choice, because he is with great sincerity and affection thy soul's friend,</P>

<HEAD>The TESTIMONY of MARGARET FOX, concerning her late Husband GEORGE FOX: together with a brief Account of some of his Travels, Suffer∣ings, and Hardships endured for the Truth's Sake.</HEAD>
<P>IT having pleased Almighty God to take away my dear husband out of this troublesome world, who was not a man thereof, being chosen out of it, and had his life and being in another region, and his testimony was against the world that the deeds thereof were evil, and therefore the world hated him; so I am now to give in my account and testimony for my dear husband, whom the Lord hath taken unto his blessed kingdom and glory: and it is before me from the Lord, and in my view, to give a relation and leave upon record the dealings of the Lord with us from the beginning.</P>
<P>He was the instrument in the hand of the Lord in this present age, which he made use of to send forth into the world to preach the everlasting gospel, which had been hid from many ages and generations; the Lord revealed it unto him, and made him open that new and living way that leads to life eternal, when he was but a youth and a stripling. And when he declared it in his own country of Leicester∣shire, and in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Warwick∣shire, and his declaration being against the hireling-priests and their practices, it raised a great fury and opposition amongst the priests and people against him; yet there was always some that owned him in several places, but very few that stood firm to him when persecution came on him. There was he and one other put in prison at Derby, but the other declined and left him in prison there; where he con∣tinued almost a whole year, and then he was released out of prison, and went on with his testimony abroad, and was put in prison again at Nottingham; and there he continued awhile, and after was released again.</P>
<P>And then he travelled on into Yorkshire, and passed up and down that great county, and several received him; as William Dewsbury, Richard Farnsworth, Thomas Aldam, and others, who all came to be faithful ministers of the Spi∣rit for the Lord. And he continued in that country, and travelled through Holderness and the Woulds, and abun∣dance were convinced; and several were brought to prison at York for their testimony to the truth, both men and wo∣men:
<PB N="lviii" REF="037441_0057_100D8DD60B9656D0"/>so that we heard of such a people that were risen, and we did, very much inquire after them. And after awhile he travelled up farther towards the dales in Yorkshire, as Wensdale and Sedbur; and amongst the hills, dales and mountains he came on, and convinced many of the eternal truth.</P>
<P>In the year 1652 it pleased the Lord to draw him towards us; so he came on from Sedbur into Westmoreland, to Fir∣bank-Chapel, where John Blaykling came with him; and so on to Preston, Grarig. Kendal, Under-barrow, Poobank, Cartmel, and Staveley, and so on to Swarthmore, my dwel∣ling-house, whither he brought the blessed tidings of the everlasting gospel, which I and many hundreds in these parts have cause to praise the Lord for. My then husband, Thomas Fell, was not at home at that time, but gone the Welsh circuit, being one of the judges of assize; and our house being a place open to entertain ministers and religious people at, one of GEORGE FOX's friends brought him thi∣ther, where he staid all night: and the next day, being a lecture or a fast-day, he went to Ulverston steeple-house, but came not in till people were gathered; I and my chil∣dren had been a long time there before. And when they were singing before the sermon he came in, and when they had done singing he stood up upon a seat or form, and de∣sired "that he might have liberty to speak;" and he that was in the pulpit said he might. And the first words that he spoke were as followeth: <Q>He is not a Jew that is one outward. neither is that circumcision which is outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, and that is circumci∣sion which is of the heart.</Q> And so he went on and said <Q>that Christ was the light of the world, and lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that by this light they mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht be gathered to God,</Q> &amp;c. I stood up in my pew, and wondered at his doctrine; for I had never heard such before. And then he went on, and opened the scrip∣tures and said, <Q>The scriptures were the prophets words, and Christ's and the apostles words, and what, as they spoke, they enjoyed and possessed, and had it from the Lord:" and said, "Then what had any to do with the scriptures, but as they came to the spirit that gave them forth. You will say, Christ saith this, and the apostles say this; but what canst thou say? Art thou a child of light, and hast walked in the light, and what thou speak∣est, is it inwardly from God.</Q> &amp;c. This opened me so,
<PB N="lix" REF="037441_0058_100D8DD8F03C53E0"/>that it cut me to the heart; and then I saw clearly, we were all wrong. So I sat down in my pew again, and cried bit∣terly; and I cried in my spirit to the Lord, <Q>We are all thieves, we are all thieves, we have taken the scriptures in words, and know nothing of them in ourselves.</Q> So that served me, that I cannot well tell what he spoke after∣wards; but he went on in declaring against the false pro∣phets, priests, and deceivers of the people. And there was one John Sawrey, a justice of peace, and a professor, that bid the churchwarden taken him away: and he laid his hands on him several times, and took them off again, and let him alone; and then after a while he gave over, and came to our house again that night. And he spoke in the family amongst the servants, and they were all generally con∣vinced; as William Caton, Thomas Salthouse, Mary Askew, Anne Clayton, and several other servants. And I was struck into such a sadness, I knew not what to do, my husband being from home. I saw it was the truth, and I could not deny it; and I did, as the Apostle saith, "I re∣ceived the truth in the love of it:" and it was opened to me so clear, that I had never a tittle in my heart against it; but I desired the Lord that I might be kept in it, and then I desired no greater portion.</P>
<P>He went on to Dalton, Aldingham, Dendrum, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ramsyde chapels and steeple-houses, and several places up and down, and the people followed him mightily: and abundance were convinced, and saw that which he spoke was truth, but the priests were all in a rage. And about two weeks after James Naylor and Richard Farnsworth fol∣lowed him and enquired him out till they came to Swarth∣more, and there staid awhile with me at our house, and did me much good; for I was under great heaviness and judgment. But the power of the Lord entered upon me within about three weeks that he came, and about three weeks end my husband came home; and many were in a mighty rage, and a deal of the captains and great ones of the country went to meet my then husband as he was coming home, and informed him, <Q>That a great disaster was befallen amongst his family, and that they were witches; and that they had taken us out of our religion; and that he must either set them away, or all the country would be undone.</Q> But no weapons formed against the Lord shall prosper, as you may see hereafter.</P>
<P>So my husband came home greatly offended; and any
<PB N="lx" REF="037441_0059_100D8DDA8853DDD0"/>may think what a condition I was like to be in, that either I must displease my husband or offend God; for he was very much troubled with us all in the house and family, they had so prepossessed him against us. But James Nay∣lor and Richard Farnsworth were both then at our house, and I desired them to come and speak to him; and so they did very moderately and wisely: but he was at first dis∣pleased with them, till they told him "they came in love and good-will to his house." And after that he had heard them speak awhile he was better satisfied, and they offered as if they would go away; but I desired them to stay, and not to go away yet, for GEORGE FOX will come this evening. And I would have had my husband to have heard them all, and satisfied himself farther about them, because they had so prepossessed him against them of such dangerous fearful things in his coming first home. And then he was pretty moderate and quiet, and his dinner being ready he went to it, and I went in and sate me down by him. And whilst I was sitting the power of the Lord seized upon me, and he was struck with amazement, and knew not what to think; but was quiet and still. And the children were all quiet and still, and grown sober, and could not play on their musick that they were learning; and all these things made him quiet and still.</P>
<P>At night GEORGE FOX came: and after supper my husband was sitting in the parlour, and I asked him, If GEORGE FOX might come in? And he said, Yes. So GEORGE came in without any compliment, and walked into the room, and began to speak presently; and the fa∣mily, and James Naylor and Richard Farnsworth came all in: and he spoke very excellently as ever I heard him, and opened Christ's and the apostles practices, which they were in, in their day. And he opened the night of apostacy since the apostles days, and laid open the priests and their practices in the apostacy; that if all in England had been there, I thought they could not have denied the truth of those things. And so my husband came to sec clearly the truth of what he spoke, and was very quiet that night, said no more, and went to bed. The next morning came Lam∣pit, priest of Ulverston, and got my husband into the gar∣den, and spoke much to him there; but my husband had seen so much the night before, that the priest got little entrance upon him. And when the priest, Lampit, was come into the house, GEORGE spoke sharpy to him, and
<PB N="lxi" REF="037441_0060_100D8DDC1D4F8658"/>asked him, <Q>When God spoke to him, and called him to go and preach to the people?</Q> But after awhile the priest went away: this was on the sixth day of the week, about the fifth month, 1652. And at our house divers friends were speaking one to another, how there were several convinced here-aways, and we could not tell where to get a meeting; my husband also being present, he overheard, and said of his own accord, "You may meet here if you will:" and that was the first meeting we had that he offered of his own accord. And then notice was given that day and the next to friends, and there was a good large meeting the first day, which was the first meeting that was at Swarth∣more, and so continued there a meeting from 1652 to 1690. And my husband went that day to the steeple-house, and none with him but his clerk, and his groom that rid with him: and the priest and the people were all fearfully troubled; but praised be the Lord, they never got their wills upon us to this day.</P>
<P>After a few weeks GEORGE went to Ulverston steeple-house again, and the said justice Sawrey, with others, set the rude rabble upon him, and they beat him so that he fell down as in a swoon, and was sore bruised and blackened in his body, and on his head and arms. Then my husband was not at home; but when he came home, he was dis∣pleased that they should do so, and spoke to justice Sawrey, and said, "It was against law to make riots." After that he was sore beat and stoned at Walney till he fell down, and also at Dalton was he sore beat and abused; so that he had very hard usage in divers places in these parts. And then when a meeting was settled here, he went again into Westmoreland, and settled meetings there; and there was a great convincement, and abundance of brave ministers came out there-aways; as John Camm, John Audland, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, Miles Halhead, and John Blaykling, with divers others. He also went over the sands to Lancaster, and Yelland, and Kellet, where Robert Wid∣ders, Richard Hubberthorn, and John Lawson, with many others, were convinced. And about that time he was in those parts, many priests and professors rose up, and falsely accused him for blasphemy, and did endeavour to take away his life, and got people to swear at a sessions at Lancaster that he had spoken blasphemy. But my then husband and colonel West, having had some sight and knowledge of the truth, withstood the two persecuting justices, John Sawrey
<PB N="lxii" REF="037441_0061_100D8DDEEDBCC550"/>and Thompson, and brought him off, and cleared him; for indeed he was innocent. And after the sessions there was a great meeting in the town of Lancaster; and many of the town's people came in, and many were convinced, And thus he was up and down about Lancaster, Yelland, Westmoreland, and some parts of Yorkshire, and our parts above one year; in which time there were above twenty-four ministers brought forth, that were ready to go with their testimony of the eternal truth unto the world: and soon after Francis Howgil and John Camm went to speak to Oliver Cromwel.</P>
<P>In the year 1653 GEORGE's drawings were into Cumber∣land by Milholm, Lampley, Embleton and Brigham, Pard∣sey and Cockermouth, where at or near Embleton he had a dispute with some priests, as Larkham and Benson, but chiefly with John Wilkinson, a preacher at Embleton and Brigham; who was afterwards convinced, and owned the truth, and was a serviceable minister both in England, Ire∣land and Scotland. And then he went to Coldbeck and several places, till he came to Carlisle, and went to their steeple-house: and they beat and abused him, and had him before the magistrates; who examined him, and put him in prison there in the common gaol among the thieves. And at the assizes was one Anthony Pearson, who had been a justice of peace, and was convinced at Appleby, when he was upon the bench, by James Naylor and Francis How∣gil, who were then prisoners there, and brought before him; so Anthony Pearson spake to the justices at Carlisle, he be∣ing acquainted with them, having married his wife out of Cumberland; and after awhile they released him. After∣wards he went into several other parts of Cumberland, and many were convinced, and owned the truth: and he gather∣ed and settled meetings there amongst them, and up and down in several parts there in the north.</P>
<P>In the year 1654 he went southward to his own country of Leicestershire, visiting friends. And then colonel Hack∣er sent him to Oliver Cromwel: and after his being kept prisoner a while, he was brought before Oliver, and was released. And then he stayed a while, visiting friends in London, and the meetings therein; and so passed westward to Bristol, and visited friends there: and after went into Cornwall, where they put him in prison at Launceston, and one Edward Pyot with him; where he had a bad, long imprisonment. When he was released, he passed into ma∣ny
<PB N="lxiii" REF="037441_0062_100D8DE2A98AA0D8"/>parts in that county of Cornwall, and settled meetings there. And then he travelled through many counties, visit∣ing friends and settling meetings all along: and so came into the north, and to Swarthmore, and to Cumberland.</P>
<P>And so for Scotland he passed in the year 1657, and there went with him Robert Widders, James Lancaster, John Grave, and others. And he travelled through many places in that nation, as Douglas, Heads, Hamilton, Glasgow, and to Edinburgh, where they took him, and car∣ried him before general Monk and the council, and examin∣ed him, and asked him his business into that nation; who answered, He came to visit the seed of God. And after they had threatened him, and charged him to depart their nation of Scotland, they let him go. And then he went to Linlithgow, and Stirling, and Johnstons, and many pla∣ces, visiting the people: and several were convinced. And after he had staid a pretty while, and settled some meetings, he returned into Northumberland, and into the bishoprick of Durham, visiting friends and settling meetings as he went; and then returned back again to Swarthmore, and staid amongst friends awhile, and so returned south again. [In 1658 judge Fell died.]</P>
<P>And in 1660 he came out of the south into the north, and had a great general meeting about Balby in Yorkshire; and so came on visiting friends in many places, till he came to Swarthmore again. And king Charles being then come in, the justices sent out warrants, and took him at Swarth∣more, charging him in their warrants, that he drew away the king's liege people, to the endangering the embruing the nation in blood, and sent him prisoner to Lancaster castle. And I having a great family, and he being taken in my house, I was moved of the Lord to go to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Whitehall; and took with me a declaration, and an in∣formation of our principles; and a long time, and much ado I had, to get to him. But at last, when I got to him, I told him, If he was guilty of those things, I was guilty, for he was taken in my house: and I gave him the paper of our principles, and desired that he would set him at liberty, as he had promised that none should suffer for ten∣der consciences, and we were of tender consciences, and desired nothing but the liberty of our consciences. And then with much ado, after he had been kept prisoner near half a year at Lancaster, we got a habeas corpus, and re∣moved him to the King's Bench, where he was released.
<PB N="lxiv" REF="037441_0063_100D8DE443BAE908"/>And then would I gladly have come home to my great fa∣mily; but was bound in my spirit, and could not have freedom to get away for a whole year. And the king had promised me several times, that we should have our liberty: and then the monarchy-men rose; and then came the great and general imprisonment of friends the nation through: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could I not have freedom nor liberty to come home, till we had got a general proclamation for all our friends liberty; and then I had freedom and peace to come home.</P>
<P>In 1663 he came north again, and to Swarthmore: and then they sent out warrants, and took him again, and had him to Holcrof before the justices, and tendered him the oath of allegiance, and sent him prisoner to Lancaster castle. And about a month after, the justices sent for me also out of my house, and tendered me the oath; and sent me pri∣soner to Lancaster. And the next assizes they tendered the oath of allegiance and supremacy again to us both, and pre∣munired me: but they had missed the date and other things in his indictment, and so it was quashed; but they tendered him the oath again, and kept him prisoner a year and a half at Lancaster castle. And then they sent him to Scarborough castle in Yorkshire, where they kept him prisoner close un∣der the soldiers most of a year and a half; so that a friend could scarcely have spoken to him; yet after that, it pleased the Lord that he was released. But I continued in prison, and a prisoner four years at that time; and an order was pro∣cured from the council, whereby I was set at liberty. And in that time I went down into Cornwall with my son and daughter Lower, and came back by London to the yearly meeting; and there I met with him again: And then he told me, The time was drawing towards our marriage, but he might first go into Ireland. And a little before this time was he prisoner in his own country at Leicester for awhile; and then released. And so into Ireland he went: and I went into Kent and Sussex; and came back to London again; and afterward I went to the west, towards Bristol, in 1669, and there I staid till he came over from Ireland, which was eleven years after my former husband's decease. In Ireland he had had a great service for the Lord and his eternal truth amongst friends and many people there, but escaped many dangers, and times of being taken prisoner, they having lain in wait aforehand for him in many places; and being returned, at Bristol he declared his intentions of
<PB N="lxv" REF="037441_0064_100D8DE68CC220E8"/>marriage; and there accordingly our marriage was solemni∣zed: and then within ten days after I came homewards; and my husband staid up and down in the countries amongst friends, visiting them.</P>
<P>Soon after I came home, there came another order from the council to cast me into prison again; and the sheriff of Lancashire sent his bailiff, and pulled me out of my own house, and had me prisoner to Lancaster castle, upon the old premunire; where I continued a whole year: and most part of all that time I was sick and weakly, and also my husband was weak and sickly at that time. After awhile he recovered, and went about to get me out of prison; and a discharge at last was got under the great seal, and so I was set at liberty: and then I was to go up to London again, for my husband was intending for America; and he was full two years away before he came back again to En∣gland: and arriving at Bristol, he came thence to London, and intended to have come to the middle of the nation with me. But when we came into some parts of Worcestershire, they got there information of him; and one justice Parker by his warrant sent him and my son Lower to Worcester gaol; and the justices there tendered him the oath, and pre∣munired him, but released my son Lower; who staid with him most of the time he was prisoner there.</P>
<P>And after some time he fell sick in a long lingering sick∣ness, and many times was very ill; so they wrote to me from London, that if I would see him alive, I might go to him; which accordingly I did. And after I had tarried seventeen weeks with him at Worcester, and no discharge like to be obtained for him, I went up to London, and wrote to the king an account of his long imprisonment, and that he was taken in his travel homewards; and that he was sick and weak, and not like to live, if they kept him long there. And I went with it to Whitehall myself; and I met with the king, and gave him the paper: and he said, I must go to the chancellor, he could do nothing in it. Then I writ also to the lord chancellor, and went to his house, and gave him my paper, and spoke to him, That the king had left it wholly to him; and if he did not take pity, and release him out of that prison. I feared he would end his days there. And the lord chancellor Finch was a very tender man, and spoke to the judge, who gave out an habeas corpus present∣ly. And when we got it, we sent it down to Worcester; and they would not part with him at first, but said, he was
<PB N="lxvi" REF="037441_0065_100D8DE8AD1A95C8"/>premunired, and was not to go out on that manner. And then we were forced to go to judge North, and to the attor∣ney-general, and we got another order, and sent down from them; and with much ado, and great labour and industry of William Mead, and other friends, we got him up to London, where he appeared at Westminster Hall at the King's Bench, before judge Hales, who was a very honest, tender man; and he knew they had imprisoned him but in envy. So that which they had against him was read; and our counsel pleaded, that he was taken up in his travel and journey; and there was but little said till he was acquitted. And this was the last prison that he was in, being freed by the court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>When he was at liberty, he recovered again; and then I was very desirous to go home with him, which we did; and this was the first time that he came to Swarthmore after we were married, and he staid here about two years, and then went to London again to the yearly meeting; and after a∣while went into Holland, and some parts of Germany, where he staid a pretty while, and then returned to London again at the next yearly meeting. And after he had staid awhile in and about London, he came into the north to Swarth∣more again, and staid that time nigh two years; and then he grew weakly, being troubled with pains and aches, hav∣ing had many sore and long travels, beatings, and hard im∣prisonments. But after some time he rode to York, and so passed on through Nottinghamshire and several counties, visiting friends till he came to London to the yearly meet∣ing, and staid there and thereabouts till he finished his course, and laid down his head in peace.</P>
<P>And though the Lord had provided an outward habita∣tion for him, yet he was not willing to stay at it, because it was so remote and far from London, where his service most lay. And my concern for God and his holy eternal truth was then in the north, where God had placed and set me; and likewise for the ordering and governing of my children and family; so that we were willing both of us to live apart some years upon God's account and his truth's service, and to deny ourselves of that comfort which we might have had in being together, for the sake and service of the Lord and his truth. And if any took occasion, or judged hard of us because of that, the Lord will judge them; for we were in∣nocent. And for my own part, I was willing to make many long journeys, for taking away all occasion of evil thoughts:
<PB N="lxvii" REF="037441_0066_100D8DEBB5009E68"/>and though I lived two hundred miles from London, yet have I been nine times there, upon the Lord's and his truth's account; and of all the times that I was at London, this last time was most comfortable, that the Lord was pleased to give me strength and ability to travel that great journey, being seventy-six years of age, to see my dear husband, who was better in his health and strength than many times I had seen him before. I look upon it that the Lord's special hand was in it that I should go then, for he lived but about half a year after I left him; which makes me admire the wisdom and goodness of God in ordering my journey at that time.</P>
<P>And now he hath finished his course and his testimony, and is entered into his eternal rest and felicity. I trust in the same powerful God, that his holy arm and power will carry me through, whatever he hath yet for me to do; and that he will be my strength and support, and the bearer-up of my head unto the end and in the end. For I know his faithfulness and goodness, and I have experience of his love; to whom be glory and powerful dominion for ever. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>The TESTIMONY of some of the AUTHOR's Relations.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER days nor length of time with us can wear out the memory of our dear and honoured father GEORGE FOX, whom the Lord hath taken to himself: and though his earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, and mortality put off, yet we believe he has a <Q>building with God eternally in the heavens, and is entered into rest,</Q> as a reward to those great labours, hard sufferings, and sore trials, he patiently endured for God and his truth. Of which truth he was made an able minister, and one, if not the first promulgator of it in our age; who, though of no great literature, nor seeming much learned as to the out∣ward, being hid from the wisdom of this world, yet he had the tongue of the learned, and could speak a word in due season to the conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary and wanted soul's rest, being deep in the divine mysteries of the kingdom of God. And the word of life and salvation through him reached into many souls,
<PB N="lxviii" REF="037441_0067_100D8DED4D7DA4D0"/>whereby many were convinced of their great duty of inward retiring to wait upon God; and as they became diligent in the performance of that service, were also raised to be preach∣ers of the same everlasting gospel of peace and glad tidings to others; who are as seals to his ministry both in this and other nations, and may possibly give a more full account thereof. Howbeit we knowing his unwearied diligence, not sparing but spending himself in the work and service where∣unto he was chosen and called of God, could not but give this short testimony of his faithfulness therein, and likewise of his tender love and care towards us; who as a tender father to children, in which capacity we stood, being so re∣lated unto him, he never failed to give us his wholesome counsel and advice. And not only so, but, as a father in Christ, he took care of the whole family and houshold of faith, which the Lord had made him an eminent overseer of, and endued him with such an excellent spirit of wis∣dom and understanding, to propose and direct helps and advantages to the well-ordering and establishing of affairs and government in the church, as now are found very ser∣viceable thereunto, and have greatly disappointed and pre∣vented the false, loose, and libertine spirit in some, who to their confusion have endeavoured, by separation and divi∣sion, to disturb the church's peace. And although many of that sort have at sundry times shot their poisonous darts at him, publickly in print, and privately other ways, yet he has always been preserved by the heavenly power of God out of the reach of their envy, and all perils and difficulties that attended on their account; who, as a sixed star in the firmament of God's power, did constantly abide, and held his integrity to the last, being of a sweet savory life, and as to conversation kept his garments clean: and though out∣wardly dead yet liveth, and his memory is right precious unto us; and it is and will be to all that abide in the love of truth, and have not declined the way of it. For he was one of the Lord's worthies, valiant for the truth upon earth, not turning his back in the day of battle; but his bow still abiding in its strength, he, through many hardships, brought gladness and refreshment to Israel's camp, being assisled by the might of that power that always put the armi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of aliens and enemies to flight. And now, having finished his course, is removed from us into a glorious state of immortality and bliss, and is gathered unto the Lord as a shock of corn in

<HEAD>An EPISTLE by way of TESTIMONY to Friends and Brethren of the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in England, Wales, and elsewhere, concerning the Decease of our faithful Brother GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From our Second Day's Morning-Meeting in London, the 26th of the 11th month, 1690.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR and truly beloved friends, brethren, and sisters in Christ Jesus, our blessed Lord and Saviour, we sin∣cerely and tenderly salute you all in his free and tender love, wherewith he hath graciously visited us, and largely shed it abroad in our souls, to our own unspeakable comfort and con∣solation, and towards his whole heritage and offspring: bles∣sed be his pure and powerful name for evermore. And our souls do truly and fervently desire, and breathe unto the God of all our mercies, that you all may be preserved and kept truly faithful and diligent in his work and service, ac∣cording to your heavenly calling and endowments, with his light, grace, and truth unto the end of your days; as be∣ing livingly engaged thereby all your appointed time to serve him, and to wait till your change come; that none may neglect that true improvement of your times and talents that God has afforded you here for your eternal advantage hereaf∣ter in that inheritance and life immortal that never fades away. And that the whole flock and heritage of Christ Jesus, which he has purchased and bought for himself with a price incorruptible, may always be preserved in his own pure love and life, so as to grow, increase, and prosper in the same, and thereby be kept in love, unity, and peace with one
<PB N="lxx" REF="037441_0069_100D8DF20B152498"/>another, as becomes his true and faithful followers, is that which our very hearts and souls desire, being often truly comforted and enlarged in the living sense and feeling of the increase and aboundings thereof among faithful friends and brethren.</P>
<P>And dear brethren and sisters, unto this our tender salu∣tation we are concerned, in brotherly love and true tender-heartedness, to add and impart unto you some account of the decease of our dear and elder brother in Christ, name∣ly, his and his church's true and faithful servant and minis∣ter GEORGE FOX, whom it hath pleased the Lord to take unto himself, as he hath divers others of his faithful servants and ministers of late time; who have faithfully served out their generation, and finished their testimony and course with joy and peace. Howbeit, O dear brethren and friends! that so many worthies in Israel, and serviceable instruments in the Lord's hand, are of late taken away and removed from us, so soon one after another, appears a dispensation that deeply and sorrowfully affects us and many more, whose hearts are upright and tender towards God and one to another in the truth. The consideration of the depth, weight, and meaning thereof is very weighty upon our spi∣rits, tho' their precious life and testimony lives with us, as being of that same body, united to one head, even Jesus Christ; in which we still, and hope ever shall have secret comfort and union with them, whom the Lord has removed and taken to himself, out of their earthly tabernacles and houses, into their heavenly and everlasting mansions.</P>
<P>This our dear brother, GEORGE FOX, was enabled by the Lord's power to preach the truth fully and effectually in our publick meeting in White Hart Court, by Grace∣church-street, London, on the 11th day of this instant 11th month, 1690: after which he said, "I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear." He was the same day taken with some illness or indisposition of body more than usual, and continued weak in body for two days after at our friend Henry Gouldney's house in the same court, close by the meeting-house, in much contentment and peace, and very sensible to the last. In which time he mentioned divers friends, and sent for some in particular; to whom he expres∣sed his mind for the spreading friends books and truth in the world and through the nations thereof, as his spirit in the Lord's love and power was universally set and bent for truth and righteousness, and the making known the way thereof
<PB N="lxxi" REF="037441_0070_100D8DF4CE977170"/>to the nations and people afar off; signifying also to some friends, "That all is well; and the seed of God reigns over all, and over death itself: that though he was weak in body, yet that the power of God is over all, and the seed reigns over all disorderly spirits:" which were his wonted sensible expressions, being in the living faith and sense thereof, which he kept to the end. And on the 13th instant, between the ninth and tenth hour of the night, he quietly departed this life in peace, being two days after the Lord enabled him to publish and preach the blessed truth in the meeting as aforesaid. So that he clearly and evidently ended his days in his faithful testimony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and peace and good-will to all men, being about sixty and six years of age, as we understand, when he departed this life.</P>
<P>And on the sixteenth of this instant, being the day ap∣pointed for his funeral, a very great concourse of friends and other people assembled at our meeting-house in White Hart Court aforesaid, about the mid-day, in order to attend his body to our burying place near Bunhillfields, to be in∣terred, as friends last office of love and respect due on that account. The meeting was held about two hours, with great and heavenly solemnity, manifestly attended with the Lord's blessed power and presence; and divers living testi∣monies given from a lively remembrance and sense of this his dear ancient servant, his blessed ministry and testi∣mony of the breaking forth of this gospel-day; his inno∣cent life, long and great travels, and labours of love in the everlasting gospel, for the turning and gathering many thou∣sands from darkness to the light of Christ Jesus, the foun∣dation of true faith; also of his manifold sufferings, afflic∣tions, and oppositions which he met withal for his faith∣ful testimony, both from his open adversaries and false bre∣thren; and his preservations, dominion, and deliverances out of them all by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour was and is ascribed, in raising up and preserv∣ing this his faithful witness and minister to the end of his days, whose blessed memorial will everlasting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y remain.</P>
<P>He loved truth and righteousness, and bore faithful tes∣timony against deceit and the mystery of iniquity; and often, of late time especially, warned friends against covet∣ousness, earthly-mindedness, against getting into the earth, and into a brittle spirit; and the younger sort, against loose∣ness and pride of life.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxii" REF="037441_0071_100D8DF661F48140"/>
A few days before he died he had a great concern upon his mind concerning some in whom the Lord's power was working, to lead them into a ministry and testimony to his truth; who, through their too much entangling themselves in the things of this world, did make themselves unready to answer the call and leadings of the power of God, and hurt the gift that was bestowed upon them, and did not take that regard to their service and ministry as they ought. And mentioned the apostle's exhortation to Timothy, to <Q>take heed to his ministry, and to shew himself approved,</Q> &amp;c. And expressed his grief concerning such as preferred their own business before the Lord's business, and sought the ad∣vancing worldly concerns before the concerns of truth: and concluded with a tender and fatherly exhortation to all to whom God had imparted of his heavenly treasure, that they would improve it faithfully; and be diligent in the Lord's work, that the earth might be sown with the seed of the kingdom, and God's harvest might be minded by those whom he had called and enabled to labour therein: and that such would commit the care of their outward concerns to the Lord, who would care for them, and give a blessing to them. However, this is not mentioned to encourage any to run unsent, or without being called of God.</P>
<P>Many are living witnesses that the Lord raised him up by his power, to proclaim his mighty day to the nations, and made him an effectual instrument in our day to turn many from darkness to light, and from Satan's power to God; and freely to suffer and bear all reproaches, and the manifold persecutions, buffetings, halings, stonings, impri∣sonments, and cruelties, that were in the beginning and for some time inflicted on him and others, for the name of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>He was in his testimony as a fixed star in the firmament of God's power, where all that be truly wise, and that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever and ever. He knew and preached the mystery of Christ revealed, the life and substance, and the power of godliness, above all shadows and forms: the Lord endued him with a hidden wisdom and life. He loved peace, and earnestly laboured for uni∣versal love, unity, peace, and good order in the churches of Christ: and where-ever he met with the contrary, it was his great grief and burden. He was greatly for the encou∣ragement of faithful labourers in the Lord's work; and it
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="037441_0072_100D7F34499FCA78"/>was a great offence and grief to him to have their testimony weakened, or labours slighted, through prejudice in any professing truth.</P>
<P>And inasmuch as the Lord suffered him not to be deli∣vered up to the will of his enemies and persecutors, who often heretofore breathed out cruelty against him, and de∣signed his destruction; but in his good pleasure so fairly and quietly took him away in his own time, when his tes∣timony was so blessedly finished, and his work accomplish∣ed; this is all remarkable, and worthy of serious and due observation, as being a special and divine providence and wisdom of God; to whom we ascribe the glory of all, and not unto man or creatures. Though we must needs allow and own that good report and due esteem which faithful elders, ministers, and servants of God and Christ have by faith obtained, to the praise of that blessed Power that up∣held them in every age in their day; many whereof are even of late taken away from the evil to come, and are at rest in the Lord, out of the reach of all envy and persecu∣tion, where the wicked cannot trouble them any more.</P>
<P>And we must patiently bear our parting with them, and our loss and sorrow on that account, with respect to their unspeakable gain: yet how can we avoid being deeply af∣fected with sadness of spirit and brokenness of heart, under the sense and consideration of such loss and revolutions, which we have cause to believe are ominous of calamities to the wicked world, though of good to the righteous? Did the death of plain upright Jacob, namely Israel, who was as a prince of God, so deeply affect both his own children and kindred, as that they made a great and sore lamentation for him; and even the Egyptians also, that they bewail∣ed him seventy days? And the death of Moses so deeply affect the Children of Israel, as that they "did weep and mourn for him in the plain of Moab thirty days?" And the death of Stephen, that faithful martyr of Jesus, so deeply affect certain men fearing God, as <Q>that they made great lamentation for him?</Q> And the apostle Paul, when taking his leave of the elders of the church of Ephesus and telling them, "they should see his face no more?" If this did so deeply affect them, that they "wept all abun∣dantly, sorrowing most of all for these words, that they should see his face no more;" with many more of this kind, how then can we otherwise choose but be deeply affected with sorrow and sadness of heart, though not as those which
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="037441_0073_100D8DFA22398920"/>have no hope, when so many of our ancient, dear, and faithful brethren, with whom we have had much sweet so∣ciety, are removed from us one after another? (We pray God raise up and increase more such!) Yet must we all contentedly submit to the good pleasure and wisdom of the Lord our God in all these things; who taketh away, and none can hinder him, nor may any say unto him, "What dost thou?" Yet we have cause to bless the Lord that he hath of late raised, and is raising up more to publish his name in the earth; and we that yet remain have but a short time to stay after them that are gone, but we shall be gone to them also. The Lord God of life keep us all faithful in his holy truth, love, unity, and life to the end. He hath a great work still to bring forth in the earth, and great things to bring to pass, in order to make way for truth and righteousness to take place therein; and that his seed may come forth and be gathered, and the power and kingdom of our God and of his Christ made known and exalted in the earth, unto the ends thereof.</P>
<P>Dear friends and brethren, Be faithful till death, that a crown of life you may obtain. All dwell in the love of God in Christ Jesus, in union and peace in him; to whom we tenderly commit you to keep and strengthen you, bless and preserve you to the end of your days. In whose dear and tender love we remain—</P>

<HEAD>THOMAS ELLWOOD'S Account of that eminent and honourable Servant of the Lord, GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS holy man was raised up by God in an extraor∣dinary manner, for an extraordinary work, even to awaken the sleeping world, by proclaiming the mighty day of the Lord to the nations, and publishing again the ever∣lasting gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, after the long and dismal night of apostacy and darkness. For this work the Lord began to prepare him by many and various trials and exercises from his very childhood; and having fitted and furnished him for it, he called him into it very young; and made him instrumental, by the effectual working of the Holy Ghost, through his ministry, to call many others into the same work, and to turn many thousands from darkness to the light of Christ, and from the power of Satan unto God. I knew him not till they year 1660: from that time to the time of his death, I knew him well, conversed with him often, observed him much, loved him dearly, and ho∣noured him truly; and upon good experience can say, he was indeed an heavenly-minded man, zealous for the name of the Lord, and preferred the honour of God before all things.</P>
<P>He was valiant for the truth, bold in asserting it, patient in suffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, steady in his testimony to it; immovable as a rock. Deep he was in di∣vine knowledge, clear in opening heavenly mysteries, plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer. He was richly endued with heavenly wisdom, quick in discerning, sound in judgment, able and ready in giving, discreet in keeping counsel; a lover of righteousness, an encourager of
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="037441_0075_100D8DFECF84A418"/>virtue, justice, temperance, meekness, purity, chastity, mo∣desty, humility, charity and self-denial in all, both by word and example. Graceful he was in countenance, manly in personage, grave in gesture, courteous in conversation, weighty in communication, instructive in discourse; free from affectation in speech or carriage. A severe reprover of hard and obstinate sinners; a mild and gentle admonish∣er of such as were tender, and sensible of their failings; not apt to resent personal wrongs; easy to forgive injuries; but zealously earnest where the honour of God, the prosper∣ity of truth, the peace of the church were concerned. Very tender, compassionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any sort of affliction; full of brotherly love, full of fatherly care: for indeed the care of the churches of Christ was daily upon him, the prosperity and peace whereof he studiously sought. Beloved he was of God, beloved of God's people; and (which was not the least part of his honour) the common butt of all apostates envy, whose good notwithstanding he earnestly sought.</P>
<P>He lived to see the desire of his soul, the spreading of that blessed principle of divine light through many of the European nations, and not a few of the American islands and provinces, and the gathering many thousands into an establishment therein; which the Lord vouchsafed him the honour to be the first effectual publisher of in this latter age of the world. And having fought a good fight, finish∣ed his could, and kept the faith, his righteous soul, freed from the earthly tabernacle, in which he had led an exem∣plary life of holiness, was translated into those heavenly mansions, where Christ our Lord went to prepare a place for his; there to possess that glorious crown of righteous∣ness which is laid up for, and shall be given by the Lord the righteous judge to all them that love his appearance. Ages to come and people yet unborn shall call him blessed, and bless the Lord for raising of him up: and blessed shall we also be, if we so walk as we had him for an exam∣ple: for whom this testimony lives in my heart, He lived and died the SERVANT of the LORD.</P>

<HEAD>The Appearance of the Lord's Everlasting Truth breaking forth again in his Eternal Power in this our Day and Age in ENGLAND—</HEAD>
<P>WHerein the Lord's mighty power and word of life hath been richly and freely preached, to the gather∣ing of many into reconciliation with God, by it; to the exaltation and glory of the great God, through the bring∣ing forth of the heavenly and spiritual fruits, from such as have been gathered by his eternal light, power, and Spirit unto himself. And by the sowing to the Spirit in the hearts of people, life eternal hath been reaped: that the flocks have been gathered, which have the milk of the word plenteous∣ly: that the riches of the word have flourished, and migh∣tily abounded; and God's heavenly plough with his spirit∣ual men hath gone on cheerfully, to the overturning the fallow ground of the hearts that had not borne heavenly fruit to God. And God's heavenly threshers with his hea∣venly flail have with joy and delight threshed out the chaff and the corruptions that have been atop of God's seed and wheat in man and woman: and thus have they threshed in hope, and are made partakers of their hope; through which God's seed is come into his garner.</P>
<P>O the unutterable glory and the inexpressib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> excellency of the everlasting glorious truth, gospel, and word of life, that the infinite, invisible, and wise God (who is over all) hath revealed and manifested! And how have the profess∣ors, priests, and powers risen up in opposition against his children, that are born of the immortal seed by the word of God! And O how great have the persecutions and re∣proaches, and spoiling of goods been, that have been exe∣cuted upon them! But they that have touched them, and touch them, which are as dear to God as the apple of his eye, how hath the Lord manifested himself to stand by them, in overthrowing powers, priests, and states! What changes have there been since 1644 and 1650, and 1652! How have the gaols been filled since then in this nation with the heirs of life, God's chosen ones, who had no helper in the earth but the Lord and his Christ! So that truth's faithful witnesses were scarcely to be found but in gaols and prisons, where the righteous were numbered among the nanigressors;
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="037441_0077_100D8E03CCE39F20"/>who had neither staff nor bag from man, but the staff, the bread of life, and the bag that holds the treasure that waxes not old.

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OR HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRAVELS, SUFFERINGS, &amp;c. OF GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THAT all may know the dealings of the LORD with me, and the various exercises, trials, and troubles through which be led me; in order to prepare and fit me for the work unto which he had appointed me, and may thereby be drawn to admire and glorify his Infinite Wisdom and Goodness; I think fit, before I proceed to set forth my publick travels in the service of Truth, briefly to mention how it was with me in my youth, and how the work of the LORD was begun, and gradually carried on in me, even from my childhood.</P>
<P>I was born in the month called July, in the year 1624, at Drayton in the Clay, in Leicestershire. My father's name was Christopher Fox. He was by profession a weav∣er, an honest man, and there was a Seed of GOD in him. The neighbours called him Righteous Christer. My mother was an upright woman; her maiden name was Mary Lago, of the family of the Lago's, and of the stock of the martyrs.</P>
<P>In my very young years I had a gravity and stayedness of mind and spirit not usual in children; insomuch that when I have seen old men carry themselves lightly and wan∣tonly towards each other, a dislike thereof hath risen in my heart, and I have said within myself. <Q>If ever I come to be a man, surely I should not do so, nor be so wanton.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="037441_0079_100D8EB560F9E8E8"/>
When I came to eleven years of age, I knew pureness and righteousness; for while I was a child I was taught how to walk so as to be kept pure. The LORD taught me to be faithful in all things, and to act faithfully two ways, viz. inwardly to GOD, and outwardly to man; and to keep to yea and nay in all things. For the LORD shewed me, though the people of the world have mouths full of deceit and changeable words, that I was to keep to yea and nay in all things, that my words should be few and savoury, seasoned with grace; and that I might not eat and drink to make myself wanton, but for health, using the creatures in their service, as servants in their places, to the glory of him that created them: they being in their covenant, and I being brought up into the covenant, as sanctified by the Word which was in the beginning, by which all things are upheld, wherein is unity with the creation.</P>
<P>But people being strangers to the covenant of life with God, they eat and drink to make themselves wanton with the creatures, wasting them upon their lusts, living in all filthiness, and devouring the creation; all this in the world, in the pollutions thereof without God: therefore I was to shun all such.</P>
<P>As I grew up my relations thought to have made me a priest; but others persuaded to the contrary. Whereupon I was put to a man who was a shoe-maker by trade, and dealt in wool. He also used grazing, and sold cattle; and a great deal went through my hands. While I was with him he was blest, but after I left him he broke and came to nothing. I never wronged man or woman in all that time; for the Lord's power was with me, and over me, to preserve me. While I was in that service, I used in my dealings the word [Verily] and it was a common saying among those that knew me, <Q>If George says verily, there is not altering him.</Q> When boys and rude persons would laugh at me: I let them alone and went my way: but people had gene∣rally a love to me for my innocency and honesty.</P>
<P>When I came towards nineteen years of age, being up∣on business at a fair, one of my cousins, whose name was Bradford, a professor, having another professor with him, came and asked me to drink part of a jug of beer with them, I, being thirsty, went in with them; for I loved any who had a sense of good, or that sought after the Lord. When we had drank a glass apiece, they began to drink healths, and called for more drink, agreeing together, That he that
<PB N="3" REF="037441_0080_100D7F4C48348E30"/>would not drink, should pay all. I was grieved that any, who made profession of religion should offer to do so. They grieved me very much, having never had such a thing put to me before, by any sort of people. Wherefore I rose up, and putting my hand in my pocket, took out a groat, and laid it upon the table before them, saying. "If it be so, I will leave you." So I went away; and when I had done my business returned home; but did not go to bed that night, nor could I sleep; but sometimes walked up and down, and sometimes prayed, and cried to the Lord, who said unto me; ☟ <Q>Thou seest how young people go together into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou must forsake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as a stranger unto all.</Q></P>
<P>Then at the command of God, the ninth of the seventh month, 1643, I left my relations, and broke off all famili∣arity or fellowship with young or old. I passed to Lutter∣worth where I staid some tirae. From thence I went to Northampton, where also I made some stay; then passed to Newport-pagnel, in Buckinghamshire; where, after I had staid awhile I went to Barnet, in the fourth month called June, in the year 1644. As I thus travelled through the country, professors took notice of me, and sought to be ac∣quainted with me; but I was afraid of them: for I was sensible they did not possess what they professed. During the time I was at Barnet, a strong temptation to despair came upon me. I then saw how Christ was tempted, and mighty troubles I was in. Sometimes I kept myself retired in my chamber, and often walked solitary in the Chace to wait upon the Lord.</P>
<P>I wondered why these things should come to me. I look∣ed upon myself, and said, "Was I ever so before?" Then I thought, because I had forsaken my relations, I had done amiss against them. So I was brought to call to mind all my time that I had spent, and to consider whether I had wronged any: but temptations grew more and more, and I was tempted almost to despair; and when Satan could not effect his design upon me that way, he laid snares and baits to draw me to commit some sin, whereby he might take advantage to bring me to despair. I was about twenty years of age when these exercises came upon me, and some years I continued in that condition in great trouble, and fain I would have put if from me. I went to many a priest to look for comfort, but found no comfort from them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037441_0081_100D7F4DCC896578"/>
From Barnet I went to London, where I took a lodging, and was under great misery and trouble there; for I looked upon the great professors of the city of London, and saw all was dark and under the chain of darkness. I had an uncle there, one Pickering, a baptist, and they were tender then: yet I could not impart my mind to him, nor join with them; for I saw all, young and old, where they were. Some tender people would have had me staid, but I was fearful, and returned homeward into Leicestershire, having a regard upon my mind to my parents and relations, lest I should grieve them; who, I understood, were troubled at my absence.</P>
<P>Being returned into Leicestershire, my relations would have had me married; but I told them I was but a lad, and must get wisdom. Others would have had me into the auxiliary band among the soldiery, but I refused, and was grieved that they offered such things to me, being a tender youth. Then I went to Coventry, where I took a cham∣ber for awhile at a professor's house, till people began to be acquainted with me; for there were many tender people in that town. After some time I went into my own country again, and continued about a year, in great sorrow and trou∣ble, and walked many nights by myself.</P>
<P>Then the priest of Drayton, the town of my birth, whose name was Nathaniel Stevens, came often to me, and I went often to him; and another priest sometimes came with him; and they would give place to me, to hear me; and I would ask them questions, and reason with them. This priest Stevens asked me, <Q>Why Christ cried out upon the cross, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</Q> And why he said, <Q>If it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not my will, but thine be done?</Q> I told him; at that time the sins of all mankind were upon him, and their in∣iquities and transgressions, with which he was wounded; which he was to bear and to be an offering for, as he was man, but died not as he was God; so, in that he died for all men, tasting death for every man, he was an offering for the sins of the whole world. This I spoke, being at that time in a measure sensible of Christ's sufferings. The priest said, <Q>It was a very good, full answer, and such a one as he had not heard.</Q> At that time he would applaud and speak highly of me to others; and what I said in discourse to him on week-days, he would preach of on first-days,
<PB N="5" REF="037441_0082_100D7F4F64776B30"/>which gave me a dislike to him. This priest afterwards be∣came my great persecutor.</P>
<P>After this I went to another ancient priest at Mansetter in Warwickshire, and reasoned with him about the ground of despair and temptations; but he was ignorant of my con∣dition: he bid me take tobacco and sing psalms. Tobacco was a thing I did not love, and psalms I was not in a state to sing; I could not sing. He bid me come again, and he would tell me many things; but when I came he was angry and pettish, for my former words had displeased him. He told my troubles, sorrows, and griefs to his servants, so that it was got among the milk-lasses. It grieved me that I should open my mind to such a one. I saw they were all miserable comforters, and this increased my troubles upon me. I heard of a priest living about Tamworth, who was account∣ed an experienced man. I went seven miles to him, but found him like an empty, hollow cask. I heard of one cal∣led Dr. Cradock, of Coventry, and went to him; I asked him the ground of temptations and despair, and how trou∣bles came to be wrought in man? He asked me, <Q>Who was Christ's father and mother?</Q> I told him Mary was his mother, and that he was supposed to be the son of Jo∣seph; but he was the Son of God. As we were walking to∣gether in his garden, the alley being narrow, I chanced, in turning, to set my foot on the side of a bed; at which he raged as if his house had been on fire. Thus all our discourse was lost, and I went away in sorrow, worse than I was when I came: I thought them miserable comforters, and saw they were all as nothing to me; for they could not reach my con∣dition. After this I went to another, one Macham, a priest, in high account. He would needs give me some physick, and I was to have been let blood; but they could not get one drop of blood from me, either in arms or head, though they endeavoured it, my body being, as it were, dried up with sorrows, grief, and troubles, which were so great upon me, that I could have wished I had never been born, or that I had been born blind, that I might never have seen wick∣edness nor vanity; and deaf, that I might never have heard vain and wicked words, or the Lord's name blasphemed. When the time called Christmas came, while others were feasting and sporting themselves, I looked out poor widows from house to house, and gave them some money. When I was invited to marriages I went to none at all; but the next day, or soon after, I would go and visit them; and if
<PB N="6" REF="037441_0083_100D7F6B5DB20D00"/>they were poor I gave them some money; for I had where∣with both to keep myself from being chargeable to others, and to administer something to the necessities of others.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1646, as I was going into Coventry, a consideration arose in me, how it was said, that "All christians are believers, both protestants and pa∣pists;" and the Lord opened to me that if all were be∣lievers, then they were all born of God, and passed from death to life; and that none were true believers but such: and though others said they were believers, yet they were not. At another time as I was walking in a field on a first-day morning, the Lord opened unto me, <Q>That being bred at Oxford or Cambridge was not enough to fit and qua∣lify men to be ministers of Christ:</Q> and I. wondered at it, because it was the common belief of people. But I saw it clearly as the Lord opened it to me, and was satisfied and admired the goodness of the Lord, who had opened this thing unto me that morning. This struck at priest Stevens's ministry, namely, that <Q>to be bred at Oxford or Cam∣bridge was not enough to make a man fit to be a minister of Christ.</Q> So that which opened in me, I saw struck at the priest's ministry. But my relations were much trou∣bled, that I would not go with them to hear the priest; for I would go into the orchard or the fields, with my bible, by myself. I asked them, did not the apostle say to be∣lievers, <Q>That they needed no man to teach them, but as the anointing teacheth them?</Q> Though they knew this was scripture, and that it was true, yet they were grieved because I could not be subject in this matter, to go to hear the priest with them. I saw that to be a true believer was another thing than they looked upon it to be; and I saw that being bred at Oxford or Cambridge did not qualify or fit a man to be a minister of Christ; what then should I follow such for? So neither them, nor any of the dissent∣ing people could I join with; but was as a stranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>At another time it was opened in me, <Q>That God who made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands.</Q> This at the first seemed strange, because both priests and people used to call their temples or churches, dreadful places, holy ground, and the temples of God. But the Lord shewed me clearly, that he did not dwell in these temples which men had commanded and set up, but in peoples hearts. Both Stephen and the apostle Paul bore
<PB N="7" REF="037441_0084_100D7F6E0DAA3AE0"/>testimony, that he did not dwell in temples made with hands, not even in that which he had once commanded to be built, since he put an end to the typical dispensation; but that his people were his temple, and he dwelt in them. This opened in me, as I walked in the fields to my rela∣tion's house. When I came there, they told me Nathaniel Stevens, the priest, had been there, and said, <Q>He was afraid of me for going after new lights.</Q> I smiled in my∣self, knowing what the Lord had opened in me concerning him and his brethren; but I told not my relations, who though they saw beyond the priests, yet went to hear them, and were grieved because I would not go also. But I shewed them by the scriptures, there was an anointing within man to teach him, and that the Lord would teach his people himself. I had great openings concerning the things written in the Revelations; and when I spoke of them, the priests and professors would say, that was a sealed book, and would have kept me out of it. But I told them, Christ could open the seals, and that they were the nearest things to us; for the Epistles were written to the saints that lived in former ages, but the Revelations were written of things to come.</P>
<P>After this I met with a sort of people that held, women have no souls (adding in a light manner) no more than a goose. I reproved them, and told them that was not right: for Mary said, <Q>My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</Q></P>
<P>Removing to another place I came among a people that relied much on dreams. I told them except they could distinguish between dream and dream they would confound all together; for there were three sorts of dreams: multitude of business sometimes caused dreams; and there were whis∣perings of Satan in man in the night season; and there were speakings of God to man in dreams. But these people came out of these things, and at last became friends.</P>
<P>Though I had great openings, yet great trouble and temptations came many times upon me, so that when it was day I wished for night, and when it was night I wished for day; and by reason of the openings I had in my troubles, I could say as David said, <Q>Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</Q> When I had openings they answered one another, and answered the scriptures; for I had great openings of the scriptures; and
<PB N="8" REF="037441_0085_100D7F49F2061378"/>when I was in troubles, one trouble also answered to another.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1647 I was moved of the Lord to go into Derbyshire, where I met with some friendly people, and had many discourses with them. Then passing into the Peak-country, I met with more friendly people, and with some in empty high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>notions. Travelling through some parts of Leicestershire, and into Nottingham∣shire, I met with a tender people, and a very tender wo∣man, whose name was Elizabeth Hootton. With these I had some meetings and discourses; but my troubles conti∣nued, and I was often under great temptations. I fasted much, walked abroad in solitary places many days, and often took my bible, and sate in hollow trees and lonesome places till night came on; and frequently in the night walked mournfully about by myself: for I was a man of sorrows in the time of the first workings of the Lord in me.</P>
<P>During all this time I was never joined in profession of religion with any, but gave up myself to the Lord, having forsaken all evil company, taken leave of father and mo∣ther, and all other relations, and travelled up and down as a stranger in the earth, which way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myself in the town where I came, and tarrying sometimes more, sometimes less in a place: for I durst not stay long in a place, being afraid both of professor and profane, lest, being a tender young man, I should be hurt by conversing much with either. For which reason I kept much as a stranger, seeking hea∣venly wisdom, and getting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord alone. Though my exercises and troubles were very great, yet were they not so continual but that I had some inter∣missions, and was sometimes brought into such an heavenly joy, that I thought I had been in Abraham's bosom. As I cannot declare the misery I was in, it was so great and heavy upon me, so neither can I set forth the mercies of God unto me in all my misery. O the everlasting love of God to my soul, when I was in great distress! when my troubles and torments were great, then was his love exceed∣ing great. Thou, Lord, makest a fruitful field a barren wilderness, and a barren wilderness a fruitful field! thou bringest down and settest up! thou killest and makest alive! all honour and glory be to thee, O Lord of Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y! The knowledge of thee in the Spirit is life; but that knowledge
<PB N="9" REF="037441_0086_100D7F6FA172B2C8"/>which is fleshly works death. While there is this knowledge in the flesh, deceit and self will conform to any thing, and will say Yes, Yes, to that it doth not know. The know∣ledge which the world hath, of what the prophets and apostles spake, is a fleshly knowledge; and the apostates from the life, in which the prophets and apostles were, have got their words, the holy scriptures, in a form, but not in the life nor spirit that gave them forth. So they all lie in con∣fusion; and are making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, but not to fulfil the law and command of Christ in his power and Spirit: for that, they say they can∣not do; but to fulfil the lusts of the flesh, that they can do with delight.</P>
<P>After I had received that opening from the Lord, that to be bred at Oxford or Cambridge, was not sufficient to fit a man to be a minister of Christ, I regarded the priests less, and looked more after the dissenting people. Among them I saw there was some tenderness; and many of them came af∣terwards to be convinced, for they had some openings. But as I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; then, O then, I heard a voice which said, "There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition." When I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition, namely, that I might give him all the glory. For all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief, as I had been, that Jesus Christ might have the pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who shall let it? This I knew experimentally. My desires after the Lord grew stronger, and zeal in the pure know∣ledge of God, and of Christ alone, without the help of any man, book, or writing. For though I read the scriptures that spake of Christ and of God, yet I knew him not but by revelation, as he who hath the key did open, and as the Father of life drew me to his Son by his Spirit. Then the Lord gently led me along, and let me see his love, which was endless and eternal, surpassing all the knowledge that men have in the natural state, or can get by history or books. That love let me see myself, as I was without him;
<PB N="10" REF="037441_0087_100D8E0858005D08"/>and I was afraid of all company: for I saw them perfect∣ly, where they were, through the love of God which let me see myself. I had not fellowship with any people, priests, nor professors, nor any sort of separated people, but with Christ who hath the key, and opened the door of light and life unto me. I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could see nothing but corruptions, and the life lay under the burden of corruptions. When I was in the deep, under all shut up, I could not believe that I should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows, and my tempta∣tions were so great, that I often thought I should have de∣spaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ opened to me how he was tempted by the same devil, and had overcome him, and had bruised his head; and that through him and his power, light, grace, and Spirit, I should overcome also, I had confidence in him. So he it was that opened to me when I was shut up, and had neither hope nor faith. Christ, who had enlightened me, gave me his light to believe in, and gave me hope, which is himself revealed in me, and gave me his spirit and grace, which I found sufficient in the deeps and in weakness. Thus in the deepest miseries, in the greatest sorrows and temptations that beset me, the Lord in his mercy did keep me. I found two thirsts in me; the one after the creatures, to have got help and strength there; and the other after the Lord the Creator, and his Son Jesus Christ; and I saw all the world could do me no good. If I had had a king's diet, palace and attendance, all would have been as nothing; for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power. I saw professors, priests, and people, were whole and at ease in that condition which was my mi∣sery, and they loved that which I would have been rid of. But the Lord did stay my desires upon himself, from whom my help came, and my care was cast upon him alone. Therefore, all wait patiently upon the Lord, whatsoever condition you be in; wait in the grace and truth that comes by Jesus; for if ye so do, there is a promise to you, and the Lord God will fulfil it in you. Blessed are all they in∣deed that do indeed hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be satisfied with it. I have found it so, praised be the Lord who filleth with it, and satisfieth the desires of the hungry soul. O let the house of the spiritual Israel say, His mercy endureth for ever! It is the great love of God, to make a wilderness of that which is pleasant to the out∣ward eye and fleshly mind; and to make a fruitful field of
<PB N="11" REF="037441_0088_100D8E09ED3B48E0"/>a barren wilderness. This is the great work of God. But while people's minds run in the earthly, after the creatures and changeable things, changeable ways and religions, and changeable uncertain teachers, their minds are in bondage, and they are brittle and changeable, tossed up and down with windy doctrines, thoughts, notions, and things; their minds being out of the unchangeable truth in the inward parts, the light of Jesus Christ, which would keep them to the unchangeable. He is the way to the Father; who in all my troubles preserved me by his Spirit and power, praised be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>Again, I heard a voice which said, Thou serpent, thou dost seek to destroy the life, but canst not; for the sword which keepeth the tree of life shall destroy thee. So Christ, the Word of God, that bruised the head of the serpent, the destroyer, preserved me; my mind being joined to his good seed that bruised the head of this serpent, the destroyer. This inward life sprung up in me, to answer all the oppos∣ing professors and priests, and brought scriptures to my memory to refute them with.</P>
<P>At another time I saw the great love of God, and was filled with admiration at the infiniteness of it. I saw what was cast out from God, and what entered into God's king∣dom; and how by Jesus, the opener of the door by his heavenly key, the entrance was given. I saw death, how it had passed upon all men, and oppressed the seed of God in man, and in me; and how I in the seed came forth, and what the promise was to. Yet it was so, that there seemed to be two pleading in me; and questionings arose in my mind about gifts and prophecies, and I was tempted again to despair, as if I had sinned against the Holy Ghost. I was in great perplexity and trouble for many days; yet I gave up myself to the Lord still. One day, when I had been walking solitarily abroad, and was come home, I was taken up in the love of God, so that I could not but ad∣mire the greatness of his love; and while I was in that con∣dition, it was opened unto me by the eternal light and pow∣er, and I therein clearly saw. That all was done and to be done in and by Christ; and how he conquers and destroys this tempter the devil, and all his works, and is atop of him; and that all these troubles were good for me, and temptations for the trial of my faith, which Christ had giv∣en me. The Lord opened me, that I saw through all these troubles and temptations. My living faith was raised, that
<PB N="12" REF="037441_0089_100D8E0CB2CF8D98"/>I saw all was done by Christ the life, and my belief was in him. When at any time my condition was veiled, my se∣cret belief was stayed firm, and hope underneath held me, as an anchor in the bottom of the sea, and anchored my immor∣tal soul to its bishop, causing it to swim above the sea, the world, where all the raging waves, foul weather, tempests and temptations are. But O! then did I see my troubles, trials, and temptations more clearly than ever I had done. As the light appeared, all appeared that is out of the light; darkness, death, temptations, the unrighteous, the ungodly; all was manifest and seen in the light. After this, a pure fire appeared in me: then I saw how he sat as a refiner's fire, and as the fuller's sope. Then the spiritual discerning came into me; by which I discerned my own thoughts, groans, and sighs; and what it was that veiled me, and what it was that opened me. That which could not abide in the patience, nor endure the fire, in the light I found to be the groans of the flesh, that could not give up to the will of God; which had so veiled me, that I could not be patient in all trials, troubles, anguishes, and perplexities; could not give up self to die by the cross, the power of God, that the living and quickened might follow him, and that that which would cloud and veil from the presence of Christ, that which the sword of the Spirit cuts down, and which must die, might not be kept alive. I discerned the groans of the Spirit, which opened me, and made intercession to God: in which Spirit is the true waiting upon God, for the redemption of the body, and of the whole creation. By this true Spirit, in which the true sighing is I saw over the false sighings and groanings. By this invisible Spirit I discerned all the false hearing, the false seeing, and the false smelling, which was above the Spirit, quenching and grieving it; and that all that were there were in confusion and deceit, where the false asking and praying is, in deceit and atop, in that nature and tongue that takes God's holy name in vain, wallows in the Egyptian sea, and asketh but hath not; for they hate his light, resist the Holy Ghost, turn the grace into wantonness, rebel against the Spirit, and are erred from the faith they should ask in, and from the Spirit they should pray by. He that knoweth these things in the true Spirit can witness them. The divine light of Christ manifesteth all things, the spiritual fire trieth and severeth all things. Several things did I then see, as the Lord opened them to me; for he shewed me that which can live in his holy
<PB N="13" REF="037441_0090_100D8E0EAC19FE48"/>refining fire, and that can live to God under his law. He made me sensible, how the law and the prophets were until John; and how the least in the everlasting kingdom of God is greater than John. The pure and perfect law of God is over the flesh, to keep it and its works, which are not per∣fect, under, by the perfect law: and the law of God which is perfect, answers the perfect principle of God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every one. This law the Jews, the prophets, and John were to perform and do. None knows the giver of this law but by the Spirit of God; neither can any truly read it, or hear its voice, but by the Spirit of God. He that can receive it, let him. John, who was one of the greatest prophets that was born of a wo∣man, bore witness to the light which Christ, the great heaven∣ly prophet, hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal; that they might believe in it, become the children of light, and so have the light of life, and not come into condemnation. For the true belief stands in the light that condemns all evil; and the devil, who is the prince of darkness, and would draw out of the light into condemna∣tion. They that walk in this light, come to the mountain of the house of God, established above all mountains, and to God's teaching, who will teach them his ways. These things were opened to me in the light.</P>
<P>I saw also the mountains burning up, and the rubbish, the rough, crooked ways and places made smooth and plain, that the Lord might come into his tabernacle. These things are to be found in man's heart; but to speak of these things being within, seemed strange to the rough, crooked, and mountainous ones. Yet the Lord saith, <Q>O earth, hear the word of the Lord!</Q> The law of the Spirit crosseth the fleshly mind, spirit, and will, which lives in disobedi∣ence, and doth not keep within the law of the Spirit. I saw this law was the pure love of God which was upon me, and which I must go through, though I was troubled while I was under it; for I could not be dead to the law but through the law, which did judge and condemn that which is to be condemned. I saw, many talked of the law, who had never known the law to be their school-master; and many ralked of the gospel of Christ, who had never known life and immortality brought to light in them by it. You that have been under that school-master, and the condemn∣ation of it, know these things; for though the Lord in that day opened these things unto the in secret, they have been since published by his eternal Spirit, as on the house-top.
<PB N="14" REF="037441_0091_100D8E10476BCBA8"/>As you are brought into the law, and through the law to be dead to it, and witness the righteousness of the law ful∣filled in you, ye will afterwards come to know what it is to be brought into the faith, and through faith from under the law; and abiding in the faith, which Christ is the author of, ye will have peace and access to God. But if ye look out from the faith, and from that which would keep you in the victory, and look after fleshly things or words, ye will be brought into bondage to the flesh again, and to the law which takes hold upon the flesh and sin, and worketh wrath, and the works of the flesh will appear again. This law of God takes hold upon the law of sin and death; but the law of faith, the law of the Spirit of life, which is the love of God, and which comes by Jesus (who is the end of the law for righteousness-sake) makes free from the law of sin and death. The law of life fleshly-minded men do not know; yet they will tempt you, to draw you from the Spi∣rit into the flesh, and so into bondage. Therefore ye, who know the love of God, and the law of his Spirit, and the freedom that is in Jesus Christ, stand fast in him, in that divine faith which he is the author of in you; and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage. For the ministry of Christ Jesus, and his teaching, bringeth into liberty and freedom; but the ministry that is of man, and by man, which stands in the will of man, bringeth into bondage, and under the shadow of death and darkness. Therefore none can be ministers of Christ Jesus but in the eternal Spirit, which was before the scriptures were given forth; for if they have not his Spirit, they are none of his. Though they may have his light to condemn them that hate it, yet they can never bring any into unity and fellowship in the Spirit, except they be in it; for the seed of God is a burthensome stone to the selfish, fleshly, earthly will, which reigns in its own knowledge and understanding that must perish, and its own wisdom that is devilish. The Spirit of God is grieved, vexed, and quenched with that which brings into the fleshly bondage; and that which wars against the Spirit of God must be mortified by it; for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are con∣trary the one to the other. The flesh would have its liber∣ty, and the Spirit would have its liberty; but the Spirit is to have its liberty, and not the flesh. If therefore ye quench the Spirit, join to the flesh, and be servants of it, then ye are judged and tormented by the Spirit; but if ye join to
<PB N="15" REF="037441_0092_100D8E11FA0FBD30"/>the Spirit, and serve God in it, ye have liberty and victory over the flesh and its works. Therefore keep in the daily cross, the power of God, by which ye may witness all that to be crucified which is contrary to the will of God, and which shall not come into his kingdom. These things are here mentioned and opened for information, exhortation, and comfort to others, as the Lord opened them unto me in that day. In that day I wondered that the children of Israel should murmur for water and victuals, for I could have fasted long without murmuring or minding victuals. But I was judged at other times, that I was not contented to be sometimes without the water and bread of life, that I might learn to know how to want, and how to abound.</P>
<P>I heard of a woman in Lancashire, who had fasted two-and-twenty days, and I travelled to see her; but when I came to her, I saw she was under a temptation. When I had spoken to her what I had from the Lord, I left her, her father being high in profession. Passing on, I went among the professors at Duckenfield and Manchester, where I staid awhile and declared truth among them. There were some convinced, who received the Lord's teaching, by which they were confirmed, and stood in the truth. The profes∣sors were in a rage, all pleading for sin and imperfection; and could not endure to hear talk of perfection, or of a holy and sinless life. But the Lord's power was over all; though they were chained under darkness and sin, which they pleaded for, and quenched the tender thing in them.</P>
<P>About this time there was a great meeting of the baptists at Broughton, in Leicestershire, with some that had sepa∣rated from them. People of other counties went thither, and I went also. Not many of the baptists came, but abundance of other people were there; and the Lord open∣ed my mouth, and his everlasting truth was declared amongst them, and the power of the Lord was over them all. In that day the Lord's power began to spring; I had great openings in the scriptures, and several were convinced in those parts, and turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God: his power they did receive, and by it many were raised up to praise God. When I reasoned with professors and other people, some were con∣vinced, and did stand. Yet I was under great temptations sometimes, and my inward sufferings were heavy; but I could find none to open my condition to but the Lord alone, unto whom I cried night and day. I went back
<PB N="16" REF="037441_0093_100D8E14EC4E4518"/>into Nottinghamshire, where the Lord shewed me, that the natures of those things which were hurtful without, were within in the hearts and minds of wicked men. The na∣tures of dogs, swine, vipers, of Sodom and Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain Ishmael, Esau, &amp;c. The natures of these I saw with∣in though people had been looking without. I cried to the Lord, saying, <Q>Why should I be thus, seeing I was never addicted to commit those evils?</Q> And the Lord answered, <Q>It was needful I should have a sense of all con∣ditions, how else should I speak to all conditions?</Q> In this I saw the infinite love of God. I saw also, that there was an ocean of darkness and death; but an infinite ocean of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkness. In that also I saw the infinite love of God, and I had great openings. As I was walking by the steeple-house side in the town of Mansfield, the Lord said unto me, <Q>That which people trample upon must be thy food.</Q> And as the Lord spake he opened to me, that people and professors trampled upon the life, even the life of Christ was trampled upon; they fed upon words, and fed one another with words; but trampled under foot the blood of the son of God, which blood was my life: and they lived in their airy notions talking of him. It seemed strange to me at the first, that I should feed on that which the high professors tram∣pled upon; but the Lord opened it clearly to me by his eternal Spirit and power.</P>
<P>Then came people from far and near to see me; but I was fearful of being drawn out by them: yet I was made to open things to them. One Brown had great prophecies and sights upon his death-bed of me. He spoke openly, of what I should be made instrumental by the Lord to bring forth. And of others he spoke, that they should come to nothing; which was fulfilled on some, who then were something in shew. When this man was buried, a great work of the Lord fell upon me, to the admiration of many, who thought I had been dead; and many came to see me for about fourteen days. I was very much altered in countenance and person, as if my body had been new-moulded o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> changed. While I was in that condition, I had a sense and discerning given me by the Lord, through which I saw plainly, that when many people talked of God and of Christ, &amp;c. the serpent spoke in them; but this was hard to be borne. Yet the work of the Lord went on in some, and my sorrows and troubles began to wear off,
<PB N="17" REF="037441_0094_100D8E1778552868"/>and tears of joy dropped from me, so that I could have wept night and day with tears of joy to the Lord, in humi∣lity and brokenness of heart. I saw into that which was without end, things which cannot be uttered, and of the greatness and infiniteness of the love of God, which cannot be expressed by words. For I had been brought through the very ocean of darkness and death, and through and over the power of Satan, by the eternal glorious power of Christ; even through that darkness was I brought which covered over all the world, which chained down all, and shut up all in the death. The same eternal power of God which brought me through these things, was that which af∣terwards shook the nations, priests, professors, and people. Then could I say, I had been in spiritual Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, and the grave; but by the eternal power of God I was come out of it, was brought over it, and the power of it into the power of Christ. And I saw the harvest white, and the seed of God lying thick in the ground, as ever did wheat that was sown outwardly, and none to gather it; for this I mourned with tears. A report went abroad of me, that I was a young man who had a discerning spirit; where∣upon many came to me from far and near, professors, priests, and people. The Lord's power broke forth, and I had great openings and prophecies, and spoke unto them of the things of God, which they heard with attention and si∣lence, and went away and spread the same thereof. Then came the tempter and set upon me again, charging me, that I had sinned against the Holy Ghost; but I could not tell in what. Then Paul's condition came before me, how after he had been taken up into the third heavens, and seen things not lawful to be uttered, a messenger of Satan was sent to buffet him. Thus by the power of Christ I got over that temptation also.</P>
<P>In the year 1648, as I was sitting in a friend's house in Nottinghamshire (for by this time the power of God had opened the hearts of some to receive the word of life and reconciliation) I saw there was a great crack to go through∣out the earth, and a great smoke to go as the crack went, and that after the crack there should be a great shaking. This was the earth in people's hearts, which was to be sha∣ken before the seed of God was raised out of the earth. And it was so: for the Lord's power began to shake them, and great meetings we began to have, and a mighty power
<PB N="18" REF="037441_0095_100D8E190F05DEF8"/>and work of God there was amongst people, to the asto∣nishment of both people and priests.</P>
<P>There was a meeting of priests and professors at a justice's house, and I went among them. Here they discoursed how Paul said, <Q>He had not known sin but by the law, which said, Thou shalt not lust:</Q> and they held that to be spo∣ken of the outward law. But I told them, Paul spoke that after he was convinced; for he had the outward law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the lust of persecu∣tion; but this was the law of God in his mind which he served, which the law in his members warred against: for that which he thought had been life to him, proved death. So the more sober of the priests and professors consented that it was not the outward law, but the inward, which shewed the inward lust which Paul spake of after he was convinced; for the outward law took hold of the outward action, but the inward law of the inward lust.</P>
<P>After this I went again to Mansfield, where was a great meeting of professors and people, where I was moved to pray; and the Lord's power was so great, that the house seemed to be shaken. When I had done, some of the professors said, <Q>It was now as in the days of the apostles, when the house was shaken where they were.</Q> After I had prayed, one of the professors would pray which brought deadness and a veil over them. Others of the professors were grieved at him, and told him, "It was a temptation upon him." Then he came to me, and desired that I would pray again; but I could not pray in man's will.</P>
<P>Soon after there was another great meeting of professors, and a captain named Amor Stoddard came in. They were discoursing of the blood of Christ. As they were discours∣ing of it, I saw, through the immediate opening of the invisible Spirit, the blood of Christ; and cried out among them, saying, <Q>Do ye not see the blood of Christ? See it in your hearts, to sprinkle your hearts and consciences from dead works, to serve the living God.</Q> For I saw the blood of the new covenant, how it came into the heart. This startled the professors, who would have the blood only without them, and not in them. But captain Stoddard was reached, and said, <Q>Let the youth speak, hear the youth speak;</Q> when he saw they endeavoured to bear me down with many words.</P>
<P>There were also a company of priests, that were looked upon to be tender; one of their names was Kellet, and se∣veral
<PB N="19" REF="037441_0096_100D8E1B2BB8A468"/>tender people went to hear them. I was moved to go after them, and bid them mind the Lord's teaching in their inward parts. Priest Kellet was against parsonage then: but afterwards he got a great one, and turned perse∣cutor.</P>
<P>After I had some service in these parts, I went through Derbyshire into my own country Leicestershire again, and several tender people were convinced. Passing thence, I met with a great company of professors in Warwickshire, who were praying and expounding the scriptures in the fields. They gave the bible to me, and I opened it on the fifth of Matthew, where Christ expounded the law; and I opened the inward state to them, and outward state; upon which they fell into a fierce contention, and parted: but the Lord's power got ground.</P>
<P>Then I heard of a great meeting to be at Leicester for a dispute, wherein presbyterians, independents, baptists, and common-prayer-men, were said to be all concerned. The meeting was in a steeple-house; to which I was moved by the Lord God to go, and be amongst them. I heard their discourse and reasonings, some being in pews, and the priest in the pulpit, abundance of people being gathered together. At last one woman asked a question out of Peter, What that birth was, viz. A being born again of incorruptible seed, by the Word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever? The priest said to her, I permit not a woman to speak in the church; though he had before given liberty for any to speak. Whereupon I was wrapped up as in a rapture, in the Lord's power; and I stepped up, and asked the priest, Dost thou call this place (the steeple-house) a church? or dost thou call this mixed multitude a church? For the wo∣man asking a question, he ought to have answered it, having given liberty for any to speak. But, instead of answering me, he asked me, What a church was? I told him, The church was the pillar and ground of truth, made up of liv∣ing stones, living members, a spiritual houshold, which Christ was the head of: but he was not the head of a mix∣ed multitude, or of an old house made up of lime, stones, and wood. This set them all on a fire. The priest came down from his pulpit, and others out of their pews, and the dispute there was marred. I went to a great inn, and there disputed the thing with the priests and professors, who were all on fire. But I maintained the true church, and the true head thereof, over their heads, till they all gave out and
<PB N="20" REF="037441_0097_100D8E1D5D9086F8"/>fled away. One man seemed loving, and appeared for a while to join with me; but he soon turned against me, and joined with a priest, in pleading for infant baptism, though himself had been a baptist before; so he left me alone. Howbeit, there were several convinced that day; the woman that asked the question was convinced, and her family: and the Lord's power and glory shined over all.</P>
<P>After this I returned into Nottinghamshire again, and went into the Vale of Beavor. As I went, I preached re∣pentance to the people. There were many convinced in the Vale of Beavor, in many towns; for I staid some weeks amongst them. One morning, as I was sitting by the fire, a great cloud came over me, a temptation beset me; and I sat still. It was said, "All things come by nature:" and the elements and stars came over me, so that I was in a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er quite clouded with it. But as I sat still and said nothing, the people of the house perceived nothing. And as I sat still under it and let it alone, a living hope and a true voice arose in me, which said, <Q>There is a living God who made all things.</Q> Immediately the cloud and tempt∣ation vanished away, and life rose over it all; my heart was glad, and I praised the living God. After some time I met with some people who had a notion that there was no God, but that all things come by nature. I had a great dispute with them, and overturned them, and made some of them confess, that there is a living God. Then I saw that it was good that I had gone through that exercise. We had great meetings in those parts; for the power of the Lord broke through in that side of the country. Returning into Nottinghamshire, I found there a company of shattered baptists, and others. The Lord's power wrought mightily, and gathered many of them. Afterwards I went to Mans∣field and there-away; where the Lord's power was wonder∣fully manifested both at Mansfield, and other towns there∣abouts. In Derbyshire the mighty power of God wrought in a wonderful manner. At Eton, a town near Derby, there was a meeting of friends, where appeared such a mighty power of God that they were greatly shaken, and many mouths were opened in the power of the Lord God. Many were moved by the Lord to go to steeple-houses to the priests and people, to declare the everlasting truth unto them.</P>
<P>At a certain time when I was at Mansfield there was a sitting of the justices about hiring servants; and it was up∣on
<PB N="21" REF="037441_0098_100D8E200456CF30"/>me from the Lord to go and speak to the justices, that they should not oppress the servants in their wages. So I walked towards the inn where they sat; but finding a com∣pany of fiddlers there, I did not go in, but thought to come in the morning, when I might have a more serious opportunity to discourse with them, not thinking that a sea∣sonable time. But when I came again in the morning, they were gone, and I was struck even blind, that I could not see. I inquired of the inn-keeper, where the justices were to sit that day? He told me, At a town eight miles off. My sight began to come to me again; and I went and ran thitherward as fast as I could. When I was come to the house where they were, and many servants with them, I exhorted the justices not to oppress the servants in their wa∣ges, but to do that which was right and just to them; and I exhorted the servants to do their duties, and serve honest∣ly, &amp;c. They all received my exhortation kindly, for I was moved of the Lord therein.</P>
<P>Moreover, I was moved to go to several courts and stee∣ple-houses at Mansfield and other places, to warn them to leave off oppression and oaths, and to turn from deceit to the Lord, and do justly. Particularly at Mansfield, after I had been at a court there, I was moved to go and speak to one of the wickedest men in the country, one who was a common drunkard, a noted whoremaster, and a rhime-ma∣ker; and I reproved him, in the dread of the mighty God, for his evil courses. When I had done speaking, and left him, he came after me, and told me, He was so smitten when I spake to him, that he had scarce any strength left in him. So this man was convinced, turned from his wic∣kedness, and remained an honest, sober man, to the asto∣nishment of the people who had known him before. Thus the work of the Lord went forward, and many were turned from darkness to light, within the compass of these three years, 1646, 1647, and 1648. Divers meetings of friends, in several places, were then gathered to God's teaching, by his light, Spirit, and power: for the Lord's power broke forth daily more and more wonderfully.</P>
<P>Now was I come up in Spirit, through the flaming sword, into the paradise of God. All things were new; and all the creation gave another smell unto me than before, beyond what words can utter. I knew nothing but pureness, inno∣cency, and righteousness, being renewed up into the image of God by Christ Jesus; so that I was come up to the state
<PB N="22" REF="037441_0099_100D8E21966A72F8"/>of Adam, which he was in before he fell. The creation was opened to me; and it was shewed me, how all things had their names given them, according to their nature and virtue. I was at a stand in my mind, whether I should practice physick for the good of mankind, seeing the nature and virtues of the creatures were so opened to me by the Lord. But I was immediately taken up in Spirit, to see into another or more steadfast state than Adam's in innocen∣cy, even into a state in Christ Jesus, that should never fall. The Lord shewed me, that such as were faithful to him, in the power and light of Christ, should come up into that state in which Adam was before he fell; in which the ad∣mirable works of the creation, and the virtues thereof may be known, through the openings of that divine Word of wisdom and power by which they were made. Great things did the Lord lead me into, and wonderful depths were opened unto me, beyond what can by words be declared; but as people come into subjection to the Spirit of God, and grow up in the image and power of the Almighty, they may receive the word of wisdom that opens all things, and come to know the hidden unity in the Eternal Being.</P>
<P>Thus travelled I in the Lord's service, as he led me. When I came to Nottingham, the mighty power of God was there among friends. From thence I went to Clauson in Leicestershire, in the Vale of Beavor, and the mighty power of God appeared there also, in several towns and villages where friends were gathered. While I was there, the Lord opened to me three things, relating to those three great professions in the world, law, physick, and divinity (so called.) He shewed me, that the physicians were out of the wisdom of God, by which the creatures were made; and knew not the virtues of the creatures, because they were out of the Word of wisdom, by which they were made. He shewed me, the priests were out of the true faith, which Christ is the author of; the faith which purifies, gives vic∣tory, and brings people to have access to God. by which they please God; the mystery of which faith is held in a pure conscience. He shewed me also, that the lawyers were out of the equity, out of the true justice, and out of the law of God, which went over the first transgression, and over all sin, and answered the Spirit of God, that was grieved and transgressed in man. And that these three, the physicians, the priests, and the lawyers, ruled the world out of the wis∣dom, out of the faith, and out of the equity and law of
<PB N="23" REF="037441_0100_100D8E2373121CA8"/>God; the one pretending the cure of the body, the other the cure of the soul, and the third the protection of the pro∣perty of the people. But I saw they were all out of the wisdom, out of the faith, out of the equity and perfect law of God. And as the Lord opened these things unto me, I felt his power went forth over all, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive and bow unto it. The priests might be reformed, and brought into the true faith, which is the gift of God. The lawyers might be reformed, and brought into the law of God, which answers that of God, which is transgressed, in every one, and brings to love one's neighbour as himself. This lets man see, if he wrongs his neighbour, he wrongs himself; and this teaches him to do unto others as he would they should do unto him. The physicians might be reformed, and brought into the wisdom of God, by which all things were made and created; that they might receive a right knowledge of the creatures, and understand the virtues of them, which the Word of Wis∣dom, by which they were made and are upheld, hath given them. Abundance was opened concerning these things; how all lay out of the wisdom of God, and out of the righteousness and holiness that man at the first was made in. But as all believe in the light, and walk in the light which Christ hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal, and become children of the light, and of the day of Christ; in his day all things are seen, visible and invisible, by the divine light of Christ, the spiritual heavenly man, by whom all things were made and created.</P>
<P>I saw concerning the priests, that although they stood in the deceit, and acted by the dark power which both they and their people were kept under; yet they were not the greatest deceivers spoken of in the scriptures, for they were not come so far as many of these had come. But the Lord opened to me who the greatest deceivers were, and how far they might come; even such as came as far as Cain, to hear the voice of God; such as came out of Egypt, and through the Red Sea, to praise God on the banks of the sea-shore; such as could speak by experience of God's miracles and wonders; such as were come as far as Corah, Dathan, and their company; such as were come as far as Balaam, who could speak the word of the Lord, who heard his voice and knew it, and knew his Spirit, and could see the star of Jacob, and the goodliness of Israel's Tent; the second birth, which no enchantment could prevail against; these that
<PB N="24" REF="037441_0101_100D8E26D36721F0"/>could speak so much of their experiences of God, and yet turned from the Spirit and the Word, and went into the gainsaying, these were and would be the great deceivers, far beyond the priests. Likewise among christians, such as should preach in Christ's name, should work miracles, cast out devils, and go as far as a Cain, a Corah, and a Balaam in the gospel-times, these were and would be the great de∣ceivers. They that could speak some experiences of Christ and God, but lived not in the life, these were they that led the world after them, who got the form of godliness, but de∣nied the power; who inwardly ravened from the Spirit, and brought people into the form, but persecuted them that were in the power, as Cain did; and ran greedily after the error of Balaam, through covetousness, loving the wages of un∣righteousness, as Balaam did. These followers of Cain, Corah, and Balaam, have brought the world, since the apostles days to be like a sea. Such as these I saw might deceive now, as they did in former ages; but it is impossi∣ble for them to deceive the elect, who were chosen in Christ, who was before the world began, and before the deceiver was: though others may be deceived in their openings and prophecies, not keeping their minds to the Lord Jesus Christ, who doth open and reveal to his.</P>
<P>I saw the state of those, both priests and people, who in reading the scriptures cry out much against Cain, Esau, Judas, and other wicked men of former times, mentioned in the holy scriptures; but do not see the nature of Cain, of Esau, of Judas, and those others, in themselves. These said, it was they, they, they, that were the bad people; put∣ting it off from themselves: but when some of these came, with the light and Spirit of truth, to see into themselves, them they came to say, I, I, I, it is I myself, that have been the Ishmael, the Esau, &amp;c. For then they saw the nature of wild Ishmael in themselves; the nature of Cain, Esau, Corah, Balaam, and of the son of perdition in themselves, sitting above all that is called God in them. I saw, it was the fallen man that was got up into the scriptures, and was finding fault with those before-mentioned; and with the backsliding Jews, calling them the sturdy oaks, tall cedars, fat bulls of Bashan, wild heifers, vipers, serpents, &amp;c. and charging them, that it was they that closed their eyes, stop∣ped their ears, hardened their hearts, and were dull of hear∣ing; it was they that hated the light, rebelled against it, quenched the Spirit, vexed and grieved it, walked despite∣fully
<PB N="25" REF="037441_0102_100D8E28DC07A0F0"/>against the Spirit of grace, and turned the grace of God into wantonness; it was they that resisted the Holy Ghost, got the form of godliness, and turned against the power; and they were the inwardly ravening wolves who had got the sheep's cloathing; they were the wells without water, clouds without rain, trees without fruit, &amp;c. But when these, who were so much taken up with finding fault with others, and thought themselves clear from these things, came to look into themselves, and with the light of Christ throughly to search themselves, they might see enough of this in themselves; then the cry could not be, It is he or they, but I and we are found in these conditions.</P>
<P>I saw also, how people read the scriptures without a right sense of them, and without duly applying them to their own states. For when they read, that death reigned from Adam to Moses; that the law and the prophets were un∣til John; and that the least in the kingdom is greater than John; they read these things without them, and ap∣plied them to others (and the things were true of others) but they did not turn in to find the truth of these things in themselves. As these things were opened in me, I saw death reigned over them from Adam to Moses; from the entrance into transgression, till they came to the ministration of condemnation, which restrains people from sin that brings death. When the ministration of Moses is passed through, the ministry of the prophets comes to be read and under∣stood, which reaches through the figures, types, and sha∣dows unto John, the greatest prophet born of a woman; whose ministration prepares the way of the Lord, by bring∣ing down the exalted mountains, and making straight paths. As this ministration is passed through, an entrance comes to be known into the everlasting kingdom. I saw plainly, that none could read Moses aright without Moses's Spirit, by which he saw how man was in the image of God in pa∣radise, how he fell, how death came over him, and how all men have been under this death. I saw how Moses receiv∣ed the pure law, that went over all transgressors; and how the clean beasts, which were figures and types, were offered up, when the people were come into the righteous law that went over the first transgression. Moses and the prophets saw through the types and figures, and beyond them, and saw Christ the great prophet, that was to come to fulfil them. I saw that none could read John's words aright, and with a true understanding of them, but in and with
<PB N="26" REF="037441_0103_100D8E2A718B0778"/>the same divine Spirit by which John spake them; and by his burning, shining light which is sent from God. For by that Spirit their crooked nature might be made straight, their rough natures smooth, and the exacter and violent doer in them might be cast out; and those that had been hypocrites, might come to bring forth fruits meet for re∣pentance, and their mountain of sin and earthliness might be laid low, and their valley exalted in them, that there might be a way prepared for the Lord in them: then the least in the kingdom is greater than John. But all must first know the voice crying in the wilderness in their hearts, which through transgression were become as a wilderness. Thus I saw it was an easy matter to say, death reigned from Adam to Moses; and that the law and the prophets were until John; and that the least in the king∣dom is greater than John; but none could know how death reigned from Adam to Moses, &amp;c. but by the same holy Spirit which Moses, the prophets, and John were in. They could not know the spiritual meaning of Moses, the pro∣phets, and John's words, nor see their path and travels, much less to see through them, and to the end of them into the kingdom, unless they had the Spirit and light of Jesus; nor could they know the words of Christ and of his apostles without his Spirit. But as man comes thro' by the Spirit and power of God to Christ (who fulfils the types, figures, shadows, promises, and prophecies concerning him) and is led by the Holy Ghost into the truth and substance of the scriptures, sitting down in him who is the author and end of them, then are they read and understood with profit and great delight.</P>
<P>Moreover the Lord God let me see, when I was brought up into his image in righteousness and holiness, and into the paradise of God, the state, how Adam was made a living soul; and also the stature of Christ, the mystery that had been hid from ages and generations: which things are hard to be uttered, and cannot be borne by many. For of all the sects in Christendom (so called) that I discoursed withal, I found none who could hear to be told, that any should come to Adam's perfection, into that image of God, that righteousness and holiness that Adam was in before he fell; to be clear and pure without sin as he was. Therefore, how should they be able to bear being told, that any should grow up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, when they cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear to hear that any shall come, whilst
<PB N="27" REF="037441_0104_100D8E2CB7FC1F70"/>upon earth, into the same power and Spirit that the prophets and apostles were in? Though it be a certain truth, that none can understand their writings aright, without the same spirit by which they were written.</P>
<P>The Lord God opened to me by his invisible power, how "every man was enlightened by the divine light of Christ." I saw it shine through all, and that they that believed in it came out of condemnation to the light of life, and became the children of it; but they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemned by it, though they made a profession of Christ. This I saw in the pure openings of the light without the help of any man; neither did I then know where to find it in the scriptures; though afterwards, searching the scriptures, I found it. For I saw in that Light and Spirit which was before the Scriptures were given forth, and which led the holy men of God to give them forth, that all must come to that Spirit, if they would know God or Christ, or the scriptures aright, which they that gave them forth were led and taught by.</P>
<P>But I observed a dulness and drowzy heaviness upon people, which I wondered at; for sometimes, when I would set myself to sleep, my mind went over all to the beginning, in that which is from everlasting to everlasting I saw death was to pass over this sleepy, heavy state, and I told people they must come to witness death to that sleepy, heavy nature, and a cross to it in the power of God, that their minds and hearts might be on things above.</P>
<P>On a certain time, as I was walking in the fields, the Lord said unto me, <Q>Thy name is written in the Lamb's book of life, which was before the foundation of the world:</Q> and as the Lord spoke it, I believed and saw it in the new birth. Some time after, the Lord commanded me to go abroad into the world, which was like a briery, thorny wilderness. When I came in the Lord's mighty power with the word of life into the world, the world swel∣led and made a noise like the great raging waves of the sea. Priests and professors, magistrates and people, were all like a sea, when I came to proclaim the day of the Lord amongst them, and to preach repentance to them.</P>
<P>I was sent to turn people from darkness to the light, that they might receive Christ Jesus; for to as many as should receive him in his light, I saw he would give power to become the sons of God; which I had obtained by re∣ceiving Christ. I was to direct people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Spirit, that
<PB N="28" REF="037441_0105_100D8E2EAC473480"/>gave forth the scriptures, by which they might be led into all truth, and up to Christ and God, as those had been who gave them forth. I was to turn them to the grace of God, and to the truth in the heart, which came by Jesus; that by this grace they might be taught, which would bring them salvation, that their hearts might be established by it, their words might be seascned, and all might come to know their salvation nigh. I saw Christ died for all men, was a propitiation for all, and enlightened all men and women with his divine and saving light; and that none could be true believers, but those who believed therein. I saw that the grace of God, which brings salvation, had appeared to all men, and that the manifestation of the Spirit of God was given to every man, to profit withal. These things I did not see by the help of man, nor by the letter, though they are written in the letter; but I saw them in the light of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by his immediate Spirit and power, as did the holy men of God by whom the holy scriptures were written. Yet I had no slight esteem of the holy scriptures, they were very precious to me; for I was in that Spirit by which they were given forth; and what the Lord opened in me, I afterwards found was agreeable to them. I could speak much of these things, and many volumes might be written; but all would prove too short to set forth the infinite love, wisdom, and power of God, in preparing, fitting, and furnishing me for the service he had appointed me to; letting me see the depth of Satan on the one hand, and opening to me, on the other hand, the divine mysteries of his own everlasting kingdom.</P>
<P>When the Lord God and his Son Jesus Christ sent me forth into the world to preach his everlasting gospel and kingdom, I was glad that I was commanded to turn peo∣ple to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nward light, spirit, and grace, by which all might know their salvation and their way to God; even that Divine Spirit which would lead them into all truth, and which I infallibly knew would never deceive any.</P>
<P>But with and by this divine power and spirit of God. and the light of Jesus, I was to bring people off from all their own ways, to Christ the new and living way; from their churches, which men had made and gathered, to the church in God, the general assembly written in heaven, which Christ is the head of; and off from the world's teach∣ers made by men, to learn of Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of whom the Father said, <Q>This is
<PB N="29" REF="037441_0106_100D8E3131940828"/>my beloved Son, hear ye him;</Q> and off from all the world's worships, to know the Spirit of truth in the inward parts, and to be led thereby, that in it they might worship the Father of spirits, who seeks such to worship him; which Spirit they that worshipped not in, knew not what they worshipped. I was to bring people off from all the world's religions, which are in vain; that they might know the pure religion might visit the fatherless, the widows and the strangers, and keep themselves from the spots of the world: then there would not be so many beggars; the sight of whom often grieved my heart, as it denoted so much hard-heartedness amongst those that professed the name of Christ. I was to bring them off from all the world's fellowships, prayings, and singings, which stood in forms without pow∣er; that their fellowship might be in the Holy Ghost, the eternal Spirit of God; that they might pray in the Holy Ghost, sing in the Spirit, and with the grace that comes by Jesus; making melody in their hearts to the Lord, who hath sent his beloved Son to be their Saviour, caused his heavenly sun to shine upon all the world, and through them all; and his heavenly rain to fall upon the just and the unjust (as his outward rain doth fall, and his out∣ward sun doth shine on all) which is God's unspeakable love to the world. I was to bring people off from Jewish ceremonies, from heathenish fables, from men's inventions and windy doctrines, by which they blowed the people about, this way and the other way, from sect to sect; and from all their beggarly rudiments, with their schools and colleges, for making ministers of Christ, who are indeed ministers of their own making, but not of Christ's; and from all their images, crosses, and sprinkling of infants, with their holy-days (so called) and all their vain traditions, which they had got up since the apostles days, which the Lord's power was against. In the dread and authority thereof was I moved to declare against them all, and against all that preached and not freely, as such who had not re∣ceived freely from Christ.</P>
<P>Moreover, when the Lord sent me into the world, he forbad me "to put off my hat" to any, high or low; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women, with∣out any respect to rich or poor, great or small. And as I travelled up and down, I was not to bid people Good morrow, or Good evening, neither might I bow or scrape with my leg to any one; this made the sects and professions
<PB N="30" REF="037441_0107_100D8E32CBBF7240"/>rage. But the Lord's power carried me over all to his glory, and many came to be turned to God in a little time; for the heavenly day of the Lord sprung from on high, and broke forth apace; by the light of which many came to see where they were.</P>
<P>Oh! the rage that was in the priests, magistrates, profes∣sors, and people of all sorts; but especially in priests and professors: for though thou to a single person was according to their accidence and grammar rules, and according to the bible, yet they could not bear to hear it; and because I could not put off my hat to them, it set them all into a rage. But the Lord shewed me that it was an honour be∣low, which he would lay in the dust and stain; an honour which proud flesh looked for, but sought not the honour which comes from God only. That it was an honour in∣vented by men in the fall and in the alienation from God, who were offended if it was not given them; yet would be looked upon as saints, church-members, and great Chris∣tians: but Christ saith, <Q>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? And I (saith Christ) receive not honour of men.</Q> Shewing that men have an honour which they will receive and give, but Christ will have none of it. This is the honour which Christ will not receive, and which must be laid in the dust. Oh! the scorn, heat, and fury that arose! Oh! the blows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments that we underwent for not putting off our hats to men! For that soon tried all mens patience and sobriety, what it was. Some had their hats violently pluck'd off and thrown away, so that they quite lost them. The bad language and evil usage we received on this ac∣count is hard to be expressed, besides the danger we were sometimes in of losing our lives for this matter, and that by the great professors of christianty, who thereby discovered they were not true believers. And though it was but a small thing in the eye of man, yet a wonderful confusion it brought among all professors and priests; but, blessed be the Lord, many came to see the vanity of that custom of putting off the hat to men, and felt the weight of Truth's testimony against it.</P>
<P>About this time I was sorely exercised in going to their courts to cry for justice, in speaking and writing to judges and justices to do justly; in warning such as kept publick houses for entertainment, that they should not let people
<PB N="31" REF="037441_0108_100D8E34F15A00B0"/>have more drink than would do them good; in testifying against wakes, feasts, may-games, sports, plays, and shews, which trained up people to vanity and looseness, and led them from the fear of God; and the days set forth for holi∣days were usually the times wherein they most dishonoured God by these things. In fairs also, and in markets, I was made to declare against their deceitful merchandize, cheat∣ing, and cozening; warning all to deal justly, to speak the truth, to let their yea be yea, and their nay be nay, and to do unto others as they would have others do unto them; forewarning them of the great and terrible day of the Lord, which would come upon them all. I was moved also to cry against all sorts of musick, and against the mountebanks playing tricks on their stages; for they burthened the pure life, and stirred up people's minds to vanity. I was much exercised too with school-masters and school-mistresses, warning them to teach children sobriety in the fear of the Lord, that they might not be nursed and trained up in lightness, vanity, and wantonness. I was made to warn masters and mistresses, fathers and mothers in private fami∣lies, to take care that their children and servants might be trained up in the fear of the Lord, and that themselves should be therein examples and patterns of sobriety and virtue to them. For I saw that as the Jews were to teach their children the law of God, the old covenant, and to train them up in it, and their servants, yea the very strangers were to keep the sabbath among them, and be circumcised, before they might eat of their sacrifices; so all that made a profession of christianity ought to train up their children and servants in the new covenant of light, Christ Jesus, who is God's salvation to the ends of the earth, that all may know their salvation. And they ought to train them up in the law of life, the law of the Spirit, the law of love and of faith, that they might be made free from the law of sin and death. And all christians ought to be circumcised by the Spirit, which puts off the body of the sins of the flesh, that they may come to eat of the heavenly sacrifice, Christ Jesus, that true spiritual food, which none can rightly feed upon but they that are circumcised by the Spirit. Likewise I was exercised about the star-gazers, who drew people's minds from Christ, the bright and the morning-star, and from the Sun of righteousness, by whom the sun, moon, and stars, and all things else were made, who is the wisdom of God, from whom the right knowledge of all things is received.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="037441_0109_100D8E3760BBC6A8"/>
But the black earthly spirit of the priest wounded my life: and when I heard the bell toll to call people together to the steeple-house, it struck at my life; for it was like a market-bell to gather people together, that the priest might set forth his ware to sale. Oh! the vast sums of money that are got by the trade they make of selling the scriptures, and by their preaching, from the highest bishop to the lowest priest! What one trade else in the world is comparable to it? notwithstanding the scriptures were given forth freely, Christ commanded his ministers to preach freely, and the prophets and apostles denounced judgment against all co∣vetous hirelings and diviners for money. But in this free Spirit of the Lord Jesus was I sent forth to declare the word of life and reconciliation freely, that all might come to Christ, who gives freely, and renews up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, that they might sit down in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>As I went towards Nottingham on a first-day in the morning, with friends to a meeting there, when I came on the top of a hill in sight of the town, I espied the great sheeple-house; and the Lord said unto me, <Q>Thou must go cry against yonder great idol, and against the wor∣shippers therein.</Q> I said nothing of this to the friends, but went with them to the meeting, where the mighty pow∣er of the Lord God was amongst us; in which I left friends sitting in the meeting, and went to the steeple-house. When I came there all the people looked like fallow ground, and the priest, like a great lump of earth, stood in his pulpit above: he took for his text these words of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <Q>We have also a more sure word of prophecy, where unto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts.</Q> He told the people this was the scriptures, by which they were to try all doctrines, religions, and opinions. Now the Lord's power was so mighty upon me, and so strong in me, that I could not hold; but was made to cry out, <Q>Oh! no; it is not the scriptures;</Q> and told them it was the holy Spirit, by which the holy men of God gave forth the scriptures, whereby opinions, religions, and judgments were to be tried; for it led into all truth, and so gave the knowledge of all truth. The Jews had the scriptures, yet resisted the Holy Ghost, and rejected Christ, the bright morning-star.
<PB N="33" REF="037441_0110_100D8E38F4C9BBA0"/>They persecuted him and his apostles, and took upon them to try their doctrines by the scriptures, but erred in judg∣ment, and did not try them right; because they tried without the Holy Ghost. As I spoke thus amongst them, the offi∣cers came, took me away, and put me into a nasty stinking prison; the smell whereof got so into my nose and throat, that it very much annoyed me.</P>
<P>But that day the Lord's power sounded so in their ears, that they were amazed at the voice, and could not get it out of their ears for some time after; they were so reached by the Lord's power in the steeple-house. At night they took me before the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs of the town. When I was brought before them, the mayor was in a peevish fretful temper, but the Lord's power allay'd him. They examined me at large; and I told them how the Lord had moved me to come. After some discourse be∣tween them and me, they sent me back to prison; but some time after the head sheriff, whose name was John Reckless, sent for me to his house. When I came in, his wife met me in the hall, and said, "Salvation is come to our house." She took me by the hand, and was much wrought upon by the power of the Lord; and her husband, children, and servants were much changed, for the power of the Lord wrought upon them. I lodged at the sheriff's, and great meetings we had in his house. Some persons of consider∣able condition in the world came to them, and the Lord's power appeared eminently amongst them. This sheriff sent for the other sheriff, and a woman they had had dealings with in the way of trade; and he told her before the other sheriff, that they had wronged her in their dealings with her (for the other sheriff and he were partners) and that they ought to make her restitation. This he spoke cheerfully; but the other sheriff denied it, and the woman said she knew nothing of it. But the friendly sheriff said it was so, the other knew it well enough; and having discovered the matter, and acknowledged the wrong done by them, he made restitution to the woman, and exhorted the other sheriff to do the like. The Lord's power was with this friendly sheriff, wrought a mighty change in him, and great openings he had. The next market-day, as he was walk∣ing with me in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ruber, he said, <Q>I must go into the market, and preach repentance to the people.</Q> Accord∣ingly he went in his slippers into the market, and into seve∣ral
<PB N="34" REF="037441_0111_100D8E3B408EF1C0"/>others also in the town were moved to speak to the mayor and magistrates, and to the people, exhorting them to re∣pent. Hereupon the magistrates grew very angry, sent for me from the sheriff's house and committed me to the com∣mon prison. When the assize came on, one person was mov∣ed to come and offer up himself for me, body for body, yea, life also: but when I should have been brought before the judge, the sheriff's man being somewhat long in bringing me to the sessions-house, the judge was risen before I came. At which I understood the judge was offended, and said, <Q>He would have admonished the youth, if he had been brought before him:</Q> for I was then imprisoned by the name of a youth. So I was returned to prison again, and put into the common gaol. The Lord's power was great among friends; but the people began to be very rude: wherefore the governor of the castle sent soldiers, and dis∣persed them; after that they were quiet. Both priests and people were astonished at the wonderful power that broke forth; several of the priests were made tender, and some did confess to the power of the Lord.</P>
<P>After I was set at liberty from Nottingham gaol, where I had been kept prisoner a pretty long time, I travelled as before, in the work of the Lord. Coming to Mansfield Woodhouse, there was a distracted woman under a doctor's hand, with her hair loose about her care. He was about to let her blood, she being first bound, and many people about her, holding her by violence; but he could get no blood from her. I desired them to unbind her and let her alone, for they could not touch the spirit in her by which she was tormented. So they did unbind her; and I was moved to speak to her, and in the name of the Lord to bid her be quiet and still; and she was so. The Lord's power settled her mind. and she mended. Afterwards she received the truth, and continued in it to her death; and the Lord's name was honoured; to whom the glory of all his works belongs. Many great and wonderful things were wrought by the heavenly power in those days; for the Lord made bare his omnipotent arm, and manifested his power to the astonishment of many; by the healing virtue whereof many have been delivered from great infirmities, and the devils were made subject through his name; of which particular instances might be given, beyond what this unbelieving age is able to receive or bear. Blessed for ever be the name of the Lord, and everlastingly honoured,
<PB N="35" REF="037441_0112_100D8E3CE30FFB90"/>and over all exalted and magnified be the arm of his glori∣ous power, by which he hath wrought gloriously: let the honour and praise of all his works be ascribed to him alone.</P>
<P>While I was at Mansfield Woodhouse, I was moved to go to the steeple-house, and declare the truth to the priest and people. But the people fell upon me in great rage, struck me down, and almost stifled me. I was cruelly beaten and bruised by them with their hands, bibles, and sticks. Then they haled me out, though I was hardly able to stand, and put me into the stocks, where I sat some hours; and they brought dog-whips and horse-whips, threatening to whip me. After some time they had me before the magistrate, at a knight's house, where were many great persons; who, seeing how evilly I had been used, after much threatening set me at liberty: but the rude peo∣ple stoned me out of the town, for preaching the Word of life to them. I was scarce able to go, or well to stand, by reason of the ill usage I had received; yet with much ado I got about a mile from the town, and then I met with some people that gave me something to comfort me, because I was inwardly bruised: but the Lord's power soon healed me again. That day some people were convinced of the Lord's truth, and turned to his teaching; at which I re∣joiced.</P>
<P>Then went I out of Nottinghamshire into Leicestershire, several friends accompanying me. There were some baptists in that country, whom I desired to speak with, because they were separated from the publick worship. So Oats, one of their chief teachers, and others of the heads of them, with several of their company, came to meet us at Barrow, where we discoursed with them. One of them said, What was not of faith, was sin. Whereupon I afked them, What Faith was? and how it was wrought in man? But they turned off from that, and spake of their baptism in water. Then I asked them, Whether their mountain of sin was brought down, and laid low in them? and their rough and crooked ways made smooth and straight in them? They looked upon the scriptures as meaning outward moun∣tains and ways; but I told them, they must sind them in their own hearts; which they seemed to wonder at. We asked them, Who baptized John the baptist? who baptized Peter, John, and the rest of the apostles? and put them to prove by scripture, that these were baptized in water: but they were silent, Then I asked them, Seeing Judas,
<PB N="36" REF="037441_0113_100D8E40D45B9FC8"/>who betrayed Christ, and was called the son of perdition, had hanged himself, what son of perdition was that which Paul spake of, that sat in the temple of God, exalted above all that is called God? And what temple of God that was in which this son of perdition sat? And whether he, that betrays Christ within in himself, be not one in nature with that Judas that betrayed Christ without? But they could not tell what to make of this, nor what to say to it. So after some discourse we parted; and some of them were loving to us.</P>
<P>On the first-day following we came to Bagworth, and went to a steeple-house, where some friends were got in, and the people locked them in, and themselves too, with the priest. But after the priest had done, they opened the door, and we went in also, and had service for the Lord amongst them. Afterwards we had a meeting in the town, amongst several that were in high notions. Then passing from thence, I heard of a people in prison at Coventry for re∣ligion. As I walked towards the gaol, the word of the Lord came to me saying, MY LOVE WAS ALWAYS TO THEE, AND THOU ART IN MY LOVE. And I was ra∣vished with the sense of the love of God, and greatly strengthened in my inward man. But when I came into the gaol where those prisoners were, a great power of dark∣ness struck at me; and I sat still, having my spirit gathered into the love of God. At last these prisoners began to rant, vapour and blaspheme; at which my soul was greatly griev∣ed. They said, they were God; but we could not bear such things. When they were calm, I stood up and asked them, Whether they did such things by motion, or from Scripture? They said, From Scripture. Then a bible lying by, I asked them for that scripture; and they shewed me that place where the sheet was let down to Peter; and it was said to him, what was sanctified he should not call common or unclean. When I had shewed them That scripture made nothing for their purpose, they brought another, which spake of God's reconciling all things to himself, things in heaven and things in earth. I told them I owned that scripture also; but shewed them it was nothing to their purpose neither. Them seeing they said, They were God, I asked them, If they knew whether it would rain to mor∣row? They said, They could not tell. I told them, God could tell. I asked them, If they thought they should be always in that condition, or should change? They answer∣ed.
<PB N="37" REF="037441_0114_100D8E4264C99658"/>They could not tell. Then said I, God can tell, and he doth not change. You say you are God; at I yet you cannot tell whether you shall change or no. So they were consounded, and quite brought down for the time. After I had reproved them for their blasphemous expressions, I went away; for I perceived they were Ranters. I had met with none before; and I admired the goodness of the Lord in appearing so unto me, before I went amongst them. Not long after this, one of these Ranters, whose name was Jo∣seph Salmon, published a recantation; upon which they were set at liberty.</P>
<P>From Coventry I went to Atherstone; and it being their lecture-day, I was moved to go to their chapel to speak to the priest and people. They were generally pretty quiet; only some sew raged, and would have had my relations to have bound me. I declared largely to them, that God was come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his people himself, and to bring them from all their man-made teachers, to hear his Son; and some were con∣vinced there.</P>
<P>Then I went to Market-Bossoth, and there was a lecture also. He that preached was Nathaniel Stevens, the priest of the town where I was born. He raged much when I spake, and told the people I was mad; though he had said before to Colonel Purfoy, There was never such a plant bred in England: he bid the people not to hear me; who, being stirred up by this deceitful priest, fell upon us, and stoned us out of the town: yet they did not do us much hurt. Howbeit some people were made loving that day; and others were confirmed, seeing the rage of both priests and professors; and some cried out, that the priest durst not stand to prove his ministry.</P>
<P>As I travelled through markets, fairs, and divers places, I saw death and darkness in all people, where the power of the Lord had not shaken them. As I was passing on in leicestershire, I came to Twy-Cross, where there were ex∣cisemen. I was moved of the Lord to go and warn them to take heed of oppressing the poor; and people were much affected with it. There was in that town a great man that had long lain sick, and was given over by the physicians. Some friends in the town desired me to visit him. I went up to him in his chamber, and spake the word of life to him, and was moved to pray by him; and the Lord was entreated, and restored him to health. When I was come down the stairs into a lower room, and was speaking to the
<PB N="38" REF="037441_0115_100D8E44592C5DD0"/>servants, and others there, a servant man of his came raving out of another room, with a naked rapier in his hand, and set it just to my side. I looked steadfastly on him, and said, <Q>Alack for thee, poor creature! what wilt thou do with thy carnal weapon? It is no more to me than a straw.</Q> The standers-by were much troubled, and he went away in a rage. But when the news of it came to his master, he turned him out of his service. Thus the Lord's power preserved me, and raised up the, weak man; who afterwards was very loving to friends. When I came to that town again, both he and his wife came to see me.</P>
<P>After this I was moved to go into Derbyshire, where the mighty power of God was among friends. I went to Ches∣terfield, where one Britland was priest. He saw beyond the common sort of priests; for he had been partly convin∣ced, and had spoken much on behalf of truth before he was priest there: but when the priest of that town died, he got the parsonage, and choked himself with it. I was mo∣ved to speak to him and the people in the great love of God, that they might come off from all men's teaching un∣to God's teaching; and he was not able to gainsay. But they had me before the mayor, and threatened to send me, with some others, to the house of correction; and kept us in custody till it was late in the night. Then the officers with the watchmen, put us out of the town, leaving us to shift as we could. I bent my course towards Derby, hav∣ing a friend or two with me. In our way we met with ma∣ny professors; and at Kidsey Park many were convinced.</P>
<P>Coming to Derby, I lay at a doctor's house, whose wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was convinced; and several more in the town. As I was walking in my chamber, the bell rung; and it struck at my life at the very hearing of it. So I asked the woman of the house, What the bell rung for? She said, There was to be a great lecture there that day, and many officers of the ar∣my, priests, and preachers, were to be there, and a colonel, that was a preacher. Then was I moved of the Lord to go up to them. When they had done, I spake to them what the Lord commanded me; and they were pretty quiet. But there came an officer, and took me by the hand, and said, I must go before the magistrates, and the other two that were with me. It was about the first hour after noon that we came before them. They alked me, Why we came thither? I said, God moved us so to do; and told them, "God dwells not in temples made with hands." I
<PB N="39" REF="037441_0116_100D8E45F39C3438"/>also said, All their preaching, baptism, and sacrifices would never sanctify them; and bid them look unto Christ in them, and not unto men; for it is Christ that sanctisies. Then they ran into many words; but I told them they were not to dispute of God and Christ, but to obey him. The power of God thundered among them, and they did fly like chaff before it. They put me in and out of the room often, hurrying me backward and forward, for they were from the first hour till the ninth at night in examining me. Sometimes they would tell me in a deriding manner, that I was taken up in raptures. At last they asked me, Whether I was sanctified? I answered, Yes; for I was in the paradise of God. Then they asked me, If I had no sin? I answered, Christ my Saviour has taken away my sin; and in him there is no sin. They asked, How we knew that Christ did abide in us? I said, By his Spirit that he hath given us. They temptingly asked, If any of us were Christ? I answered, Nay, we were nothing, Christ was all. They said, If a man steal, is it no sin? I answered, All unright∣eousness is sin. When they had wearied themselves in exa∣mining me, they committed me and one other man to the house of correction in Derby for six months, as blas∣phemers; as may appear by the mittimus, a copy whereof here followeth:</P>

Now did the priests bestir themselves in their pulpits to preach up sin for term of life. Much of their work was, to plead for it; so that people said, Never was the like heard. After some time, the person committed with me, not stand∣ing faithful in his testimony, got in with the gaoler, and by him made way to the justice to have leave to go see his mother; and so got his liberty. It then was reported, that he said I had bewitched and deceived him: but my spirit was strengthened when he was gone. The priests, profes∣sors, justices, and the gaoler, were all in a great rage against me. The gaoler watched my words and actions, often ask∣ing me questions to ensnare me; and sometimes he would ask me such silly questions, as, Whether the door was latched or not? Thinking to draw some sudden, unadvised answer from me, from whence he might take advantage to charge sin upon me: but I was kept watchsul and chaste, so that they could get no advantage of me; which they admired.</P>

<P>O Friends, I was sent to you to tell you, That if you had received the gospel freely, you would minister it freely without money or price: but you make a trade and sale of what the prophets and apostles have spoken; and so you corrupt the truth. You are the men that lead silly women captive, who are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: you have a form of godliness, but you deny the power. As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do you resist the truth; be∣ing men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, But you shall proceed no further; for your folly shall be made manifest to all men, as theirs was. Moreover the Lord sent me to tell you, that he doth look for fruits. You asked me, If the scripture was my rule? It is not your rule, to rule your lives by, but to talk of in words. You are the men that live in pleasures, pride, and wan∣tonness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulness of bread, and abundance of idleness: see if this be not the sin of Sodom.

He doth re∣quire justice and mercy, to break every yoke, and to let the oppressed go free. But who calleth for justice? or loveth mercy? or contendeth for the truth? Is not judgment turned backward?

<P>THOU that dost profess God and Christ in words, see how thou followest him. To take off burdens, to visit them that are in prison, to shew mercy, cloath thy own flesh, and deal thy bread to the hungry; these are God's commandments. To relieve the fatherless, to visit the widows in their affliction, and to keep thyself unspot∣ted of the world, this is pure religion before God. But if thou profess Christ, and followest covetousness and earthly-mindedness, thou deniest him in life, deceivest thy∣self and others, and takest him for a cloak. Wo be to you, greedy men and rich men; weep and howl for your mise∣ry that shall come! Take heed of covetousness and ex∣tortion: God doth forbid that. Wo be to the man that coveteth an evil covetousness, that he may set his nest on high, and cover himself with thick clay. Oh! do not love that which God forbids. His servant thou art whom thou dost obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.

<P>THOU art set in place to do justice; but, in impri∣soning my body, thou hast done contrary to justice, according to your own law. O take heed of pleasing men more than God, for that's the way of the scribes and pharisees: they sought the praise of men more than God.

<P>While I was here in prison divers professors came to discourse with me. I had a sense before they spoke, that
<PB N="45" REF="037441_0122_100D8E54B366B100"/>they came to plead for sin and imperfection. I asked them, Whether they were believers and had faith? They said, Yes. I asked them, In whom? They said, In Christ. I replied, If ye are true believers in Christ, you are passed from death to life; and if passed from death, then from sin that bringeth death: and if your faith be true, it will give you victory over sin and the devil, purisy your hearts and consciences (for the true faith is held in a pure conscience) and bring you to please God, and give you access to him again. But they could not endure to hear of purity, and of victory over sin and the devil. They said, <Q>They could not believe any could be free from sin on this side the grave.</Q> I bid them give over babbling about the scriptures, which were holy men's words, whilst they plead∣ed for unholiness. At another time a company of professors came, who also began to plead for sin. I asked them, Whether they had hope? They said. Yes: God forbid but we should have hope. I asked them, What hope is it that you have? Is Christ in you the hope of your glory? Doth it purify you, as he is pure? But they could not abide to hear of being made pure here. Then I bid them forbear talking of the scriptures, which were the holy men's words; for the holy men that wrote the scriptures pleaded for holiness in heart, life, and conversation here; but since you plead for impurity and sin, which is of the devil, what have you to do with the holy men's words?</P>
<P>The keeper of the prison, being an high professor, was greatly enraged against me, and spoke very wickedly of me; but it pleased the Lord one day to strike him so, that he was in great trouble, and under much terror of mind. And as I was walking in my chamber, I heard a doleful noise; and standing still, I heard him say to his wife, <Q>Wife, I have seen the day of judgment; and I saw GEORGE there, and I was afraid of him; because I had done him so much wrong, and spoken so much against him to the ministers and professors, and to the justices, and in taverns and alchouses.</Q> After this, towards the evening, he came into my chamber, and said to me, <Q>I have been as a lion against you; but now I come like a lamb, and like the gaoler that came to Paul and Silas trembling.</Q> And he desired he might lodge with me; I told him, I was in his power, he might do what he would: but he said, <Q>Nay, he would have my leave; and he could desire to be always with me, but not to have me as a prisoner.</Q> He said,
<PB N="46" REF="037441_0123_100D8E564B77C698"/><Q>He had been plagued, and his house had been plagued for my sake.</Q> So I suffered him to lodge with me. Then he told me all his heart, and said, He believed what I had said of the true faith and hope to be true; and he wondered that the other man, who was put in prison with me, did not stand it; and said, <Q>That man was not right, but I was an honest man.</Q> He confessed also to me, that at those times when I had asked him to let me go forth to speak the word of the Lord to the people, when he refused to let me go, and I laid the weight thereof upon him, that he used to be under great trouble, amazed, and almost distracted for some time after, and in such a condi∣tion that he had little strength left him. When the morn∣ing came, he rose and went to the justices, and told them, "That he and his house had been plagued for my sake." One of the justices replied (as he reported to me) that the plagues were upon them too for keeping me. This was justice Bennet of Derby, who was the first that called us Quakers, because I bid them tremble at the word of the Lord. This was in the year 1650.</P>
<P>After this the justices gave leave, that I should have liberty to walk a mile. I perceived their end, and told the gaoler. If they would set down to me how far a mile was, I might take the liberty of walking it sometimes. For I had a sense that they thought I would go away. And the gaoler confessed afterwards they did it with that intent to have me go away, to ease them of their plague; but I told him I was not of that spirit.</P>
<P>This gaoler had a sister, a sickly young woman. She came up into my chamber to visit me; and after she had staid some time, and I had spoken the words of truth to her, she went down, and told them, <Q>we were an inno∣cent people, and did none any hurt, but did good to all, even to them that hated us;</Q> and desired them to be tender towards me.</P>
<P>As by reason of my restraint I had not the opportunity of travelling about to declare and spread truth through the countries, it came upon me to write a paper, and send it forth to be spread amongst friends and other tender people, for the opening of their understandings in the way of truth, and directing them to the true teacher in themselves. It was after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord doth shew unto man his thoughts, and dis∣co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth all the secret workings in man. A man may
<PB N="47" REF="037441_0124_100D8E588701E648"/>be brought to see his evil thoughts, running mind, and vain imaginations, and may strive to keep them down, and to keep his mind in; but cannot overcome them, nor keep his mind within to the Lord. In this state and con∣dition submit to the Spirit of the Lord that shews them, and that will bring to wait upon the Lord; and he that hath discovered them will destroy them. Therefore stand in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ (who is the author of the true faith) and mind him; for he will discover the root of lusts, evil thoughts, and vain imaginations; how they are begotten, conceived, and bred; how they are brought forth, and how every evil member doth work. He will discover every principle from its own nature and root.</P>
<P>So mind the faith of Christ, and the anointing which is in you, to be taught by it, which will discover all work∣ings in you. As he teacheth you, so obey and forsake; else you will not grow in the faith, nor in the life of Christ, where the love of God is received. Love beget∣teth love, its own nature and image: and when mercy and truth meet, what joy there is! Mercy triumphs in judg∣ment; and love and mercy bear the judgment of the world in patience. That which cannot bear the world's judg∣ment is not the love of God; for love beareth all things, and is above the world's judgment; for the world's judg∣ment is but foolishness. Though it be the world's judg∣ment and practice to cast all the filthiness that is among themselves upon the saints, yet their judgment is false. The chaste virgins follow Christ the lamb, that takes away the sins of the world; but they that are of that spirit which is not chaste, will not follow Christ the lamb in his steps, but are disobedient to him in his commands. The fleshly mind doth mind the flesh, talketh fleshly, and its know∣ledge is fleshly, and not spiritual; but savours of death, not of the Spirit of life. Some men have the nature of swine wallowing in the mire. Some have the nature of dogs, to bite both the sheep and one another. Some have the nature of lions, to tear, devour, and destroy. Some the nature of wolves, to tear and devour the lambs and sheep of Christ: and some the nature of the serpent (that old adversary) to sting, envenom, and poison. <Q>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear,</Q> and learn these things within himself. Some men have the natures of other beasts and creatures, minding nothing but earthly and vi∣sible things, and feeding without the fear of God. Some
<PB N="48" REF="037441_0125_100D8E5A37305778"/>have the nature of a horse, to prance and vapour in their strength, and to be swift in doing evil. Some have the nature of tall sturdy oaks, to flourish and spread in wis∣dom and strength, who are strong in evil, which must pe∣rish and come to the fire. Thus evil is but one in all, but worketh many ways; and whatsoever a man or wo∣man's nature is addicted to that is outward, the evil one will suit him, and please his nature and appetite, to keep his mind in his inventions, and in the creatures from the Cre∣ator. O therefore let not the mind go from God; for if it do, it will be stained, venomed, and corrupted. If the mind go forth from the Lord, it is hard to bring it in again: therefore take heed of the enemy, and keep in the faith of Christ. Oh! therefore mind that which is eternal and invisible, and him who is the Creator and Mover of all things: for the things that are made, are not made of things that appear; for the visible covereth the invisible sight in you. But as the Lord, who is invisible, doth open you by his invisible power and spirit, and brings down the carnal mind in you; so the invisible and immor∣tal things are brought to light in you. O therefore you that know the light, walk in the light! for there are chil∣dren of darkness that will talk of the light, and of the truth, yet not walk in it; but the children of light love the light, and walk in the light. But the children of darkness walk in darkness, and hate the light. In them the earthly lusts and carnal mind choke the seed of faith, which bringeth oppression on the seed, and death over themselves. O therefore mind the pure Spirit of the ever∣lasting God, which will teach you to use the creatures in, their right place, and which judgeth the evil. <Q>To thee, O God, be all glory and honour, who art Lord of all visibles and invisibles! To thee be all praise, who bringest out of the deep to thyself; O powerful God, who art worthy of all glory!</Q> For the Lord who created all, and "gives life and strength to all, is over all and merciful to all. <Q>So thou, who hast made all, and art over all, to thee be all glory! In thee is my strength, refreshment, and life, my joy and my gladness, my rejoicing and glorying for evermore!</Q> To live and walk in the Spirit of God is joy, peace, and life; but the mind going forth into the creatures, or into any visible things from the Lord, this bringeth death. When the mind is got into the flesh, and into death, the accuser gets within, and the law of sin and
<PB N="49" REF="037441_0126_100D8E5D59AFF168"/>death gets into the flesh. Then the life suffers under the law of sin and death, and then there is straitness and fail∣ings. For then the good is shut up, and the self-righte∣ousness is set atop. Then man doth work in the outward law, though he cannot justify himself by the law, but is condemned by the light: for he cannot get out of that state, but by abiding in the light, resting in the mercy of God, and believing in him from whom all mercy flows. For there is peace in resting in the Lord Jesus. This is the narrow way that leads to him, the life; but few will abide in it. Keep in the innocency, and be obedient to the faith in him. Take heed of conforming to the world, and of reasoning with flesh and blood, for that bringeth disobedience; and then imaginations and questionings arise, to draw from obedience to the truth of Christ. But the obedience of faith destroyeth imaginations, question∣ings. and reasonings, with all the temptations in the flesh, buffetings, lookings forth, and fetching up things that are past. But, not keeping in the life and light, not crossing the corrupt will by the power of God, the evil nature grows up in man; then burdens will come, and man will be stained with that nature. But Esau's mountain shall be laid waste, and become a wilderness, where the dragons lie; but Jacob, the second birth, shall be fruitful and shall arise. For Esau is hated, and must not be lord; but Jacob, the second birth, which is perfect and plain, shall be lord; for he is beloved of God.</P>

<P>While I was in the house of correction, my relations came to see me; and being troubled for my imprisonment, they went to the justices that cast me into prison, and desi∣red to have me home with them; offering to be bound in one hundred pounds, and others of Derby in fifty pounds apiece with them, that I should come no more thither to de∣clare against the priests. So I was had up before the justices; and because I would not consent that they or any should be bound for me (for I was innocent from any ill behaviour. and had spoken the word of life and truth unto them) jus∣tice Bennet rose up in a range; and as I was kneeling down to pray to the Lord to forgive him, he ran upon me, and struck me with both his hands, crying, <Q>away with him, gaoler: take him away, gaoler.</Q> Whereupon I was had again to prison, and there kept, till the time of my com∣mitment for six months was expired. But I had now the liberty of walking a mile by myself; which I made use of as I felt freedom. Sometimes I went into the market and streets, and warned the people to repent of their wicked∣ness; and returned to prison again. And there being per∣sons of several forts of religion in the prison, I sometimes visited them in their meetings on first-days.</P>
<P>After I had been before the justices, and they had requi∣red sureties for my good behaviour (which I could not con∣sent

All men's words will do me no good, nor their bonds neither, to keep my heart, if I have not a guide within, to keep me in the upright life to God. But I believe in the Lord, that through his strength and power I shall be preserved from ungodliness and worldly lusts. The scrip∣ture saith, "Receive strangers;" but you imprison such.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU profess to be the ministers of Jesus Christ in words, but you shew by your fruits what your minis∣try is. Every tree shews its fruit: the ministry of Jesus Christ is in mercy and love, to loose them that are bound, to bring out of bondage, and to let them that are captivated go free. Now, friends, where is your example, if the scrip∣tures be your rule, to imprison for religion? Have you any command for it from Christ? If that were in you, which you profess, you would walk in their steps who spake the scriptures. But he is not a Jew who is one outward, whose praise is of Men; but he is a Jew who is one inward, whose praise is of God. But if you build upon the pro∣phets and apostles in words, and pervert their life, remem∣ber the woes which Jesus Christ spake against such. They that spoke the prophets words, but denied Christ, they professed a Christ to come; but had they known him, they would not have crucified him. The saints, whom the love of God did change, were brought thereby to walk in love and mercy; for he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God. But where envy, pride, and hatred rule, the nature of the world rules, not the nature of Jesus Christ. I write with no hatred to you; but that you may weigh your∣selves, and see how you pass your time.</P>

Thus having cleared my conscience to the priests, it was not long before a concern came upon me to write again to the justices, which I did as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM moved to warn you to take heed of giving way to your own wills. Love the cross; satisfy not your own minds in the flesh; but prize your time while you have it. and walk up to that you know, in obedience to God; then you shall not be condemned for that you know not, but for that you know, and do not obey. Consider betimes, weigh yourselves, see where you are, and whom you serve. For if ye blaspheme God, and take his name in vain, if ye swear and lie, if ye give way to envy, ha∣tred, covetousness, and greediness, pleasures and wanton∣ness, or any other vices, be assured that ye serve the devil; but if ye fear the Lord and serve him, ye will loath all these things. He that loveth God, will not blaspheme his name: but where there is opposing of God, and serv∣ing the devil, that profession is sad and miserable. O prize your time; do not love that which God forbids; lying, wrath, malice, envy, hatred, greediness covetousness, oppression, gluttony, drunkenness, whoredom, and all unrighteousness, God doth forbid. So consider, Evil communication corrupts good manners. Be not deceived, God will not be mocked with vain words; the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness. Therefore obey that which convinceth you of all evil, and telleth you that you should do no, evil: it will lead to re∣pentance, and keep you in the fear of the Lord. O look at the mercies of God, prize them, and do not turn them into wantonness. O eye the Lord, and not earthly things!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Besides this, I wrote the following to Colonel Barton, who was both a justice and a preacher:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO not cloak and cover thyself; there is a God who knoweth thy heart, and will uncover thee. He seeth thy way. <Q>Wo be to him that covereth, and not with my Spirit, saith the Lord.</Q> Dost thou do contrary to the law, and then put it from thee. Mercy and true judg∣ment thou neglectest; look what was spoken against such. My Saviour said to such, <Q>I was sick and in prison, and ye visited me not; I was hungry, and ye sed me not; I
<PB N="54" REF="037441_0131_100D8E67D05F7F70"/>was a stranger, and ye took me not in.</Q> 'And when they said, <Q>When saw we thee in prison, and did not come to thee,</Q> &amp;c. He replied, <Q>Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these little ones, ye did it not to me.</Q> Friend, thou hast imprisoned me for bearing witness to the life and power of truth, and yet professest to be a mi∣nister of Christ; but if Christ had sent thee, thou wouldst bring out of prison, out of bondage, and wouldst receive strangers. Thou hast been wanton upon earth, thou hast lived plenteously, and nourished thy heart as in a day of slaughter. Thou hast killed the just. O look where thou art, and how thou hast spent thy time! O remember thy∣self, and now while thou hast time, prize it. Do not slight the free mercy of God, and despise his long suffer∣ing, which is great salvation; but mind that in thee which doth convince thee, and would not let thee swear, nor lie, nor take God's name in vain. Thou knowest thou shouldst do none of these things; thou hast learned that which will condemn thee; therefore obey the light which doth convince thee, forsake thy sins, look at the mercies of God and prize his love in sparing thee till now. The Lord saith, <Q>Look unto me, all ye ends of the earth, and be ye saved;</Q> and <Q>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.</Q> Friend, prize thy time, and see whom thou servest; for his servant thou art whom thou dost obey, whether of sin unto death, or obedience unto right∣eousness. If thou servest God and fearest him, thou wilt not blaspheme his name, nor curse, nor swear, nor take his name in vain, nor follow pleasures and wantonness, whoredom and drunkenness or wrath, or malice, or revenge, or rashness, or headiness, pride or gluttony, greediness, oppression or covetousness, or foolish jesting, or vain songs; God doth forbid these things, and all unrighteousness. If thou professest God, and actest any of these things, thou takest him for a cloak, and servest the devil. Consider with thyself, and do not love that which God hateth. He that loveth God keepeth his commandments. The devil will tell thee, It is an hard thing to keep God's command∣ments; but it is an easy thing to keep the devil's com∣mandments, and to live in all unrighteousness and ungod∣liness, turning the grace of God into wantonness. But let the unrighteous man forsake his ways, and turn unto me, saith the Lord, and I will have mercy; <Q>Turn ye, why will ye die? saith the Lord.</Q></P>

Howl, ye great ones, for the plagues are pouring out upon you! Howl, ye oppressors, for recompense and ven∣geance is coming upon you! Wo unto them that covet∣ously join one house to another, and bring one field so nigh unto another that the poor can get no more ground; that ye may dwell upon the earth alone. These things are in the ears of the Lord of Hosts. Wo unto him that covetously getteth evil-gotten goods into his house, that he may set his nest on high, to escape from the power of evil.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>While I was in the house of correction, there came a trooper, and said, As he was sitting in the steeple-house, hearing the priest, exceeding great trouble fell upon him; and the voice of the Lord came to him, saying, <Q>Dost thou not know that my servant is in prison? Go to him for di∣rection.</Q> So I spake to his condition, and his under∣standing was opened. I told him, That which shewed him his sins, and troubled him for them, would shew him his salvation; for he that shews a man his sin, is the same that takes it away. While I was speaking to him, the Lord's power opened him so that he began to have a good under∣standing in the Lord's truth, and to be sensible of God's mercies. He spoke boldly in his quarters amongst the soldiers, and to others, concerning truth (for the scriptures were very much opened to him) insomuch that he said, <Q>His colonel was a blind as Nebuchadnezzar, to cast the servant of the Lord into prison.</Q> Upon this, his colonel conceived a spite against him: and at Worcester fight the year after, when the two armies lay near one another, two came out from the king's army, and challenged any two of the parliament army to fight with them; his colonel made choice of him and another to answer the challenge. And when in the encounter his companion was slain, he drove both his enemies within musket-shot of the town, without siring a pistol at them. This, when he returned, he told me with his own mouth. But when the sight was over, he saw the deceit and hypocrisy of the officers; and being sensible how wonderfully the Lord had preserved him, and seeing also to the end of fighting, he laid down his arms.</P>
<P>The time of my commitment to the house of correction be∣ing very near out, and there being many new soldiers raised, the commissioners would have made me captain over them; and the soldiers cried, They would have none but me. So the keeper of the house of correction was commanded to
<PB N="56" REF="037441_0133_100D8E6BEEF73950"/>bring me before the commissioners and soldiers in the mar∣ket-place; where they offered me that preferment, as they called it, askingme, If I would not take up arms for the com∣monwealth against Charles Stewart? I told them I knew from whence all wars arose, even from the lusts, according to James's doctrine; and that I lived in the virtue of that life and power that took away the occasion of all wars. Yet they courted me to accept of their offer, and thought I did but compliment them. But I told them I was come into the covenant of peace, which was before wars and strifes were. They said, They offered it in love and kindness to me, be∣cause of my virtue; and such-like flattering words they used. But I told them, If that was their love and kind∣ness, I trampled it under my feet. Then their rage got up, and they said, <Q>Take him away, Gaoler, and put him into the prison amongst the rogues and felons.</Q> So I was put into a lousy stinking place, without any bed, amongst thirty felons, where I was kept almost half a year; yet at times they would het me walk to the garden, believing I would not go away. When they had got me into Derby pri∣son, it was the saying of people that I should never come out; but I had faith in God that I should be delivered in his time: for the Lord had given me to believe that I was not to be removed from that place yet, being set there for a service which he had for me to do.</P>
<P>After it was bruited abroad that I was in Derby prison, my relations came to see me again; and were much trou∣bled that I should be in prison; for they looked upon it to be a great shame to them for me to lie in gaol. It was a strange thing then to be imprisoned for religion; and some thought I was mad, because I stood for purity, righteous∣ness and perfection.</P>
<P>Among others that came to see and discourse with me, there was a certain person from Nottingham, a soldier, who had been a baptist, as I understood, and with him came several others. In discourse, this person said to me, <Q>Your faith stands in a man that died at Jerusalem, and there never was any such thing.</Q> Being exceedingly grieved to hear him, I said, <Q>How! did not Christ suffer without the gates of Jerusalem, through the professing Jews, chief priests, and Pilate?</Q> He denied that ever Christ suf∣fered there outwardly. Then I asked him, Whether there were not chief priest, and Jews, and Pilate there outward∣ly? When he could not deny that, I told him, As cer∣tainly
<PB N="57" REF="037441_0134_100D8E6DE1406F98"/>as there was a chief priest, and Jews and Pilate there outwardly, so certainly was Christ persecuted by them, and did suffer there outwardly under them, Yet from this man's words was a stander raised upon us, That the Quakers should deny Christ, that suffered and died at Jerusalem: which was all utterly false; the least thought of it never entered our hearts. The same person also said. That never any of the prophets, nor apostles, nor holy men of God, suffered any thing outwardly, but all their sufferings were inward. I instanced to him many of the prophets and apostles, how and by whom they suffered. So the power of the Lord was brought over his wicked imaginations and whimsies.</P>
<P>There came also another company to me, that pretended they were triers of spirits: I asked them, What was the first step to peace? And what it was by which a man might see his salvation? They were presently up in the airy mind, and said, I was mad. Thus they came to try spirits, who did not know themselves nor their own spirits.</P>
<P>In this time of my imprisonment I was exceedingly ex∣ercised about the proceedings of the judges and magistrates in their courts of judicature, and was moved to write to the judges concerning their putting men to death for small mat∣ters; and to shew them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time; for I was under great suffering in my spirit because of it, and under the very sense of death; but standing in the will of God, an heavenly breathing arose in my soul to the Lord. Then did I see the heavens open∣ed, and I rejoiced, and gave glory to God. So I wrote to the judges in manner following:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM moved to write unto you, to take heed of putting men to death for stealing cattle, or money, &amp;c. for thieves in old time were to make restitution; and if they had not wherewith, they were to be sold for their theft. Mind the laws of God in the scriptures, and the Spirit that gave them forth; let them be your rule in exe∣cuting judgment; and shew mercy, that you may receive mercy from God, the judge of all. Take heed of gifts and rewards, and of pride; for God doth forbid them, and they blind the eyes of the wise. I do not write to give li∣berty to sin, God hath forbidden it; but that you should judge according to his laws, and shew mercy; for he de∣lighteth in true judgment, and in mercy. I beseech you,
<PB N="58" REF="037441_0135_100D8E7010C99798"/>mind these things, prize your time, now you have it; fear God, and serve him, for he is a consuming fire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Besides this, I wrote another letter to the judges, to this effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM moved to write unto you, that ye do true justice to every man; see that none be oppressed nor wronged, nor any oaths imposed; for the land mourneth because of oaths, adulteries, forceries, drunkenness, and prophane∣ness. O consider, ye that are in authority: be moderate, and in lowliness consider these things. Shew mercy to the fatherless, to the widows, and to the poor. Take heed of rewards or gifts, for they blind the eyes of the wise; the Lord doth loath all such. Love mercy and true judg∣ment, justice and righteousness; for the Lord delighteth in such. Consider these things in time, and take heed how ye spend your time. Now ye have time, prize it; and shew mercy, that ye may receive mercy from the Lord: for he is coming to try all things, and will plead with all flesh as by fire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Moreover, I laid before the judges what an hurtful thing it was that prisoners should lie so long in gaol; shewing how they learned wickedness one of another, in talking of their bad deeds; therefore speedy justice should be done. For I was a tender youth, and dwelt in the fear of God; and being grieved to hear their bad language, I was often made to reprove them for their wicked words, and evil car∣riage towards each other. People admired that I was so preserved and kept; for they never could catch a word or action from me, to make any thing of against me, all the time I was there; for the Lord's infinite power upheld and preserved me all that time; to him be praises and glo∣ry for ever!</P>
<P>While I was here, there was a young, woman in the gaol for robbing her master. When she was to be tried for her life, I wrote to the judge and jury, shewing them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time to put people to death for stealing; and moving them to shew mercy. Yet she was condemned to die, and a grave was made for her; and at the time appointed she was carried forth to execution. Then I wrote a few words, warning all to beware of greedi∣ness or covetousness, for it leads from God; and that all should fear the Lord, avoid earthly lusts, and prize their
<PB N="59" REF="037441_0136_100D8E71A4AB2560"/>time while they have it: this I gave to be read at the gal∣lows. And though they had her upon the ladder, with a cloth bound over her face, ready to be turned off. yet they did not put her to death, but brought her back to prison, where she afterwards came to be convinced of God's ever∣lasting truth.</P>
<P>There was also in the gaol, while I was there, a wicked ungodly man who was reputed a conjurer. He threatened he would talk with me, and what he would do; but he never had power to open his mouth to me. And the gaoler and he falling out, he threatened to raise the devil, and break his house down; so that he made the gaoler afraid. I was moved of the Lord to go in his power and rebuke him, and to say to him <Q>Come, let's see what thou canst do; do thy worst.</Q> I told him <Q>The devil was raised high enough in him already; but the power of God chained him down;</Q> so he slunk away from me.</P>
<P>The time of Worcester fight coming on, justice Bennet sent constables to press me for a soldier, seeing I would not voluntarily accept of a command. I told them, that I was brought off from outward wars. They came again to give me press-money; but I would take none. Then I was brought up to serjeant Holes, kept there awhile, and taken down again. Afterwards the constables brought me a se∣cond time before the commissioners, who said I should go for a soldier; but I told them I was dead to it. They said I was alive. I told them, where envy and hatred is, there is confusion. They offered me money twice, but I refused it. Being disappointed, they were angry, and committed me close prisoner, without bail or mainprize. Whereupon I wrote to them again, directing my letter to colonel Bar∣ton, a preacher, and the rest that were concerned in my commitment. I wrote thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>YOU who are without Christ, and yet use the words which he and his saints have spoken, consider neither he nor his apostles did ever imprison any; but our Saviour is merciful even to the unmerciful and rebellious. He brings out of prison and bondage; but men, while the carnal mind rules, oppress and imprison. My Saviour saith, <Q>Love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use and per∣secute you.</Q> For the love of God doth not persecute any, but loveth all where it dwelleth. <Q>He that hateth
<PB N="60" REF="037441_0137_100D8E74B1746298"/>his brother is a murderer.</Q> You profess to be Christians, and one of you a minister of Jesus Christ; yet you have imprisoned me, who am a servant of Jesus Christ. The apostles never imprisoned any, but were imprisoned them∣selves. Take heed of speaking of Christ in words, and denying him in life and power. O friends, the imprison∣ing my body is to satisfy your wills; but take heed of giving way to your wills, for that will hurt you. If the love of God had broken your hearts, you would not have imprisoned me; but my love is to you, as to all my fel∣low-creatures; and that you may weigh yourselves, and see how you stand, is this written.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>About this time I was moved to give forth the following lines, to go amongst the convinced and tender people, to manifest the deceits of the world, and how the priests have deceived the people.</P>
<P>To all that love the Lord Jesus Christ with a pure and naked heart, and the generation of the righteous.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST was ever hated; and the righteous for his sake. Mind who they were that did ever hate them. He that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit; so it is now. Mind who were the chiefest against Christ; even the great learned men, the heads of the people, rulers, and teachers, that professed the law and the prophets, and looked for Christ. They looked for an outwardly-glorious Christ, to hold up their outward glory; but Christ spoke against the works of the world, and against the priests, scribes, and pharisees, and their hypocritical profession. He that is a stranger to Christ, is an hireling; but the servants of Christ are free men. False teachers always laid burdens upon the peo∣ple; and the true servants of the Lord declared against them. Jeremiah spoke against hirelings, and said. It was an horrible thing; and, What will ye do in the end? For the people and priests were given to covetousness. Paul spoke against such as made gain upon the people, and ex∣horted the saints to turn away from such as were covetous and proud, such as loved pleasures more than God, such as had a form of godliness, but denied the power thereof. "For of this sort;", said he <Q>are they, that creep into houses, and lead captive silly women, who are ever learn∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="037441_0138_100D8E77A2B3BE48"/>but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, and as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these re∣sist the truth; but they shall proceed no farther, for their folly shall be made manifest unto all men.</Q> Moses for∣sook honours and pleasures, which he might have enjoy∣ed. The apostle in his time saw this corruption entering, which now is spread over the world, of having a form of godliness but denying the power. Ask any of your teach∣ers, whether you, may ever overcome your corruptions or sins? None of them believe that: but <Q>as long as man is here, he must (say they) carry about with him the body of sin.</Q> Thus pride is kept up, and that honour and mastership which Christ denied, and all unrightcousness. Yet multitudes of teachers! heaps of teachers! the golden cup full of abominations! Paul did not preach for wa∣ges, but laboured with his hands, that he might be an example to all that follow him. O people, see who fol∣low Paul! The prophet Jeremiah said, <Q>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means;</Q> but now the priests bear rule by the means they get from the people: take away their means, and they will bear rule over you no longer. They are such as the apostle said, <Q>Intruded into those things which they never saw, being vainly puffed up with a fleshly mind;</Q> and as the scriptures declare of some of old, <Q>They go in the way of Cain, who was a murderer, and in the way of Balaam, who coveted the wages of unrighteousness.</Q> The prophet Micah also cried against the judges that judged for reward, and the priests that taught for hire, and the prophets that prophesied for money; yet leaned on the Lord, saying. "Is not the Lord amongst us?" Gifts blind the eyes of the wise. The gift of God was never purchased with mo∣ney. All the holy servants of God did ever cry against deceit; and where the Lord hath manifested his love, they loath it, and that nature which holdeth it up:</P>

<P>I DESIRE you to consider in time whom ye imprison; for the magistrate is set for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well. But when
<PB N="62" REF="037441_0139_100D8E7933276DB0"/>the Lord sends his messengers to warn you of the woes that will come upon you except you repent, you perse∣cute them, put them in prison, and say <Q>We have a law, and by our law we may do it.</Q> For you indeed jus∣tify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts. He will not be worshipped with your forms, professions, and shews of religion. Therefore consider ye that talk of God, how ye are subject to him; for those are his children that do his will. What doth the Lord require of you, but to do justice, to love and shew mercy, to walk hum∣bly with him, and to help the widows and fatherless to their right? But instead thereof ye oppress the poor. Do not your judges judge for rewards, and your priests teach for hire? The time is coming, that he who seeth all things will discover all your secrets. Know this assuredly, The Lord will deliver his servants our of your hands, and he will recompense all your unjust dealings towards his people. I desire you to consider of these things; search the scriptures, and see, whether any of the people of God did ever imprison any for religion. They were them∣selves imprisoned. I desire you to consider, that it is written, <Q>When the church is met together ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may hear, learn, and be comforted;</Q> and then, <Q>If any thing be revealed to him that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</Q> Thus it was in the true church, and thus it ought now to be; but it is not so in your assemblies. He that teaches for hire may speak, and none may contradict him. Again, consider the liberty given to the apostles, even among the unbelieving Jews, when after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue said unto them, <Q>Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on,</Q> I desire you to consider in still∣ness, and strive not against the Lord; for he is stronger than you. Though ye hold his people fast for a time, yet when he cometh, he will make known who are his; for his coming is like the refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap. Then the stone that is set at nought by you build∣ers shall be the head-stone of the corner. O friends, lay these things to heart. Let them not seem light things to you. I wrote to you in love, to mind the laws of God, and your own souls, and to do as the holy men of God did.</P>

Great was the exercise and travail in spirit that I under∣went during my imprisonment here, because of the wicked∣ness that was in this town; for though some were con∣vinced, yet the generality were a hardened people. I saw the visitation of God's love pass away from them. I mourned over them; and it came upon me to give forth the following lines, as a lamentation for them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>AS the waters run away when the flood-gates are up, so doth the visitation of God's love pass away from thee, O Derby! Therefore look where thou art, and how thou art grounded; and consider, before thou art utterly forsaken. The Lord moved me twice before I came to cry against the deceits and vanities that are in thee, and to warn all to look at the Lord, and not at man. The wo is against the crown of pride, against drunkenness and vain pleasures, and against them that make a profes∣sion of religion in words, yet are high and lofty in mind, and live in oppression and envy. O Derby! thy profes∣sion and preaching stinks before the Lord. You profess a sabbath in words, and meet together, dressing yourselves in fine apparel, and you uphold pride. Thy women go with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, &amp;c. which the true prophets of old cried against. Your assemblies are odious, an abomination to the Lord: pride is set up and bowed down to, covetousness abounds, and he that doth wickedly is honoured. So deceit bears with deceit, yet they profess Christ in words. Oh! the deceit that is within thee! It even breaks my heart to see how God is dishonoured in thee, O Derby!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After I had seen the visitation of God's love pass away from this place, I knew that my imprisonment here would, not continue long; but I saw that when the Lord should bring me forth, it would be as the letting of a lion out of a den amongst the wild beasts of the forest. For all pro∣fessions stood in a beastly spirit and nature, pleading for sin, and for the body of sin and imperfection, as long as they lived. They raged, and ran against the life and spirit which gave forth the scriptures, yet professed them in words, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>There was a great judgment upon the town, and the ma∣gistrates were uneasy about me; but could not agree what to do with me. One while they would have sent me up to
<PB N="64" REF="037441_0141_100D8E7CDF069C98"/>the parliament; another while they would have banished me to Ireland. At first they called me a deceiver, a sedu∣cer, and a blasphemer. Afterwards, when God had brought his plagues upon them, they stiled me an honest virtuous man. But their good report and bad report were nothing to me; for the one did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lift me up, nor the other cast me down: praised be the Lord! At length they were made to turn me out of gaol, about the beginning of winter in the year 1651, after I had been a prisoner in Derby almost a year; six months in the house of correction, and the rest of the time in the common gaol.</P>
<P>Being at liberty I went on, as before, in the work of the Lord. passing through the country into Leicestershire, hav∣ing meetings as I went; and the Lord's Spirit and power accompanied me. Afterwards I went near Burton upon Trent, where some were convinced; and to Bushel-House, where I had a meeting. I went into the country, where there were friendly people; yet an outrageous wicked pro∣sessor had an intent to have done me a mischief, but the Lord prevented him: blessed be the Lord!</P>
<P>As I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head, and saw three steeple-house spires, and they struck at my life. I asked them what place that was? They said, Lichfield. Immediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither. Being come to the house we were going to, I wish'd friends to walk into the house, saying nothing to them whither I was to go. As soon as they were gone I stept away, and went by my eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a great field, shepherds were keeping their sheep. Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it was winter; and the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I put off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor shepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then I walked on about a mile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the Lord came to me again, saying; Cry, <Q>Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield!</Q> So I went up and down the streets, cry∣ing with a loud voice, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! It being market-day, I went into the mar∣ket-place, and to and fro in the several parts of it, and made stands, crying as before, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying through the streets, there seemed to
<PB N="65" REF="037441_0142_100D8E7F5C26F860"/>me to be a channel of blood running down the streets, and the market-place appeared like a pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt myself clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to the shep∣herds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them again. But the sire of the Lord was so in my feet, and all over me, that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a stand whether I should or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so to do: them, after I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again. After this a deep consideration came upon me, for what reason I should be sent to cry against that city, and call it THE BLOODY CITY! For though the parliament had the minster one while, and the king another, and much blood had been shed in the town during the wars between them, yet that was no more than had befallen many other places. But afterwards I came to understand, that in the emperor Dio∣clesian's time a thousand Christians were martyr'd in Lich∣field. So I was to go, without my shoes, through the channel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the market-place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of those martyrs, which had been shed above a thou∣sand years before, and lay cold in their streets. So the sense of this blood was upon me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord. Ancient records testify how many of the christian Britons suffered there. Much I could write of the sense I had of the blood of the martyrs, that hath been shed in this nation for the name of Christ, both under the ten persecutions and since; but I leave it to the Lord, and to his book, out of which all shall be judged; for his book is a most certain record, and his Spirit a true recorder.</P>
<P>Then I passed through the countries, having meetings amongst friendly people in many places; but my relations were offended at me. After some time I returned into Nottinghamshire, to Mansfield, and into Derbyshire, visit∣ing friends. Then passing into Yorkshire, I preached re∣pentance through Doncaster, and several other places; and came to Balby, where Richard Far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sworth and others were convinced. So travelling through several places, preaching repentance, and the word of life to the people, I came into the parts about Wakefield, where James Nayler lived; who, with Thomas Goodyear, came to me, and were both convinced, and received the truth. William Dewsbury also and his wife, with many more came to me, who were
<PB N="66" REF="037441_0143_100D8E81972F68D8"/>convinced, and received the truth. From thence I passed towards captain Pursloe's by Selby, and visited John Leek, who had been to see me in Derby prison, and was convin∣ced. I had a horse, but was fain to leave him, not know∣ing what to do with him; for I was moved to go to many great houses, to admonish and exhort the people to turn to the Lord. I was moved of the Lord to go to Beverly steeple-house, which was a place of high profession. Being very wet with rain, I went first to an inn. As soon as I came to the door, a young woman of the house said, "What! is it you? Come in," as if she had known me before; for the Lord's power bowed their hearts. So I re∣freshed myself, and went to bed. In the morning, my cloaths' being still wet, I got ready, and having paid for what I had, went up to the steeple-house, where was a man preaching. When he had done, I was moved to speak to him and to the people in the mighty power of God, and turned them to their teacher, Christ Jesus. The power of the Lord was so strong, that it struck a mighty dread amongst the people. The mayor came and spoke a few words to me; but none had power to meddle with me. So I passed out of the town, and in the afternoon went to another steeple-house about two miles off. When the priest had done I was moved to speak to him and to the people very largely, shewing them the way of life and truth, and the ground of election and reprobation. The priest said, he was but a child, and could not dispute with me. I told him I did not come to dispute, but to hold forth the word of life and truth unto them, that they might all know the one seed which the promise of God was to, both in the male and in the female. Here the people were very loving, and would have had me come again on a week∣day, and preach among them: but I directed them to their teacher, Christ Jesus; and the next day went to Cransick, to captain Pursloe's; who accompanied me to justice Ho∣tham's. Justice Hotham was a pretty tender man, and had some experience of God's workings in his heart. After some discourse with him of the things of God, he took me into his closet; where sitting together, he told me he had known that principle these ten years, and was glad that the Lord did now send his servants to publish it abroad to the people. After awhile a priest came to visit him, with whom I had some discourse concerning truth. His mouth was
<PB N="67" REF="037441_0144_100D8E83F08A1238"/>quickly stopt; for he was nothing but a notionist, and not in possession of what he talked of.</P>
<P>While I was there, a great woman of Beverly came to justice Hotham about some business. In discourse she told him, <Q>The last sabbath-day, as she called it, there was an angel or spirit came into the church at Beverly, and spoke the wonderful things of God, to the astonishment of all that were there; and when it had done, it passed away, and they did not know whence it came nor whither it went; but it astonished all, priest, professors, and ma∣gistrates.</Q> This relation justice Hotham gave me after∣wards; and then I gave him an account that I had been that day at Beverly steeple-house, and had declared truth to the priest and people there.</P>
<P>In the country thereabouts were some noted priests and doctors that justice Hotham had acquaintance with. He would fain have them speak with me, and offered to send for them, under pretence of some business he had with them; but I wish'd him not to do so.</P>
<P>When first-day was come, justice Hotham walked out with me into the fields; and captain Pursloe coming after us, justice Hotham left us, and returned home; but captain Pursloe went with me into the steeple-house. When the priest had done, I spoke to both priest and people; decla∣red to them the word of life and truth, and directed them where they might find their teacher, the Lord Jesus Christ. Some were convinced, received the truth, and stand fast in it, and have a sine meeting to this day.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went to another steeple-house, about three miles off, where preached a great high priest, called a doctor, one of them whom justice Hotham would have sent for to have spoken with me. I went into the steeple-house, and staid till the priest had done. The words which he took for his text were these: <Q>Ho, every one that thirst∣eth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</Q> Then was I moved of the Lord God to say to him, <Q>Come down, thou de∣ceiver; dost thou bid people come freely, and take of the water of life freely, and yet thou takest three hundred pounds a year of them for preaching the scriptures to them? Mayst thou not blush for shame? Did the pro∣phet Isaiah and Christ do so, who spake the words, and gave them forth freely?</Q> Did not Christ say to his minis∣ters,
<PB N="68" REF="037441_0145_100D8E86CD5C6900"/>whom he sent to preach, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give?</Q> The priest, like a man amazed, hasted away. After he had left his flock, I had as much time as I could desire to speak to the people. I directed them from darkness to the light, and to the grace of God that would teach them, and bring them salvation; to the Spirit of God in their inward parts, which would be a free teacher unto them.</P>
<P>Having cleared myself amongst that people, I returned to justice Hotham's that night; who, when I came in, took me in his arms, and said, His house was my house, for he was exceeding glad at the work of the Lord, and that his power was revealed. Then he told me why he went not with me to the steeple-house in the morning, and what rea∣sonings he had in himself about it; for he thought, if he had gone with me to the steeple-house, the officers would have put me to him; and then he should not have known what to have done: but he was glad, he said, when captain Pursloe came up to go with me; yet neither of them was dressed, nor had their bands about their necks. It was a strange thing then to see a man come into a steeple-house without a band; yet captain Pursloe went in with me with∣out his band, the Lord's power and truth had so affected him that he minded it not.</P>
<P>From hence I passed on, and came at night to an inn where was a company of rude people. I bid the woman of the house, if she had any meat, to bring me some; but be∣cause I said Thee and Thou to her, she looked strangely on me. I asked her if she had any milk? She said, No. I was sensible she spake falsely; and, being willing to try her fur∣ther, I asked her, If she had any cream? She denied that she had any. There stood a churn in the room, and a little boy playing about, put his hands into it, and pulled it down, and threw all the cream on the floor before my eyes. Thus was the woman manifested to be a liar. She was amazed, blessed herself, took up the child, and whipped it sorely: but I reproved her for her lying and deceit. After the Lord had thus discovered her deceit and perverseness, I walked out of the house, and went away till I came to a stack of hay, and lay in the hay-stack that night, in rain and snow; it being but three days before the time called Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as.</P>
<P>The next day I came into York, where were several very tender people. Upon the first-day following. I was com∣manded of the Lord to go and speak to priest Bowles and
<PB N="69" REF="037441_0146_100D8E8941FF9CA8"/>his hearers in their great cathedral. Accordingly I went: When the priest had done, I told them I had something from the Lord God to speak to the priest and people. <Q>Then say on quickly.</Q> said a professor, for it was frost and snow, and very cold weather. Then I told them, This was the word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in words, but God Almighty looked for fruits amongst them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth, they hurried me out, and threw me down the steps. But I got up again without hurt, and went to my lodging, and seve∣ral were convinced there. For what arose from the weight and oppression that was upon the Spirit of God in me, would open people, strike them, and make them consess that the groans which brake forth through me did reach them; for my life was burthened with their profession with∣out possession, and words without fruit.</P>
<P>After I had done my present service in York, and several were convinced there, received the truth of God, and were turned to his teaching; I looked towards Cleaveland, and saw there was a people that had tasted of the power of God. I saw there was a seed in that country, and that God had an humble people there. Passing onwards that night, a papist overtook me, and talked to me of his religion, and of their meetings; and I let him speak all that was in his mind. That night I staid at an alehouse. Next morning I was moved to speak the word of the Lord to this papist. So I went to his house, and declared against all their super∣stitious ways; and told him, that God was come to teach his people himself. This put him into such a rage, that he could not endure to stay in his own house.</P>
<P>Next day I came to Burraby, where a priest and several friendly people were met together. Many of the people were convinced, and have continued faithful ever since. There is a great meeting of friends in that town. The priest also was forced to confess to truth, though he came not in∣to it.</P>
<P>The day following I went to Cleaveland, amongst those people that had tasted of the power of God. They had formerly had great meetings, but were then shattered to pie∣ces, and the heads of them turned Ranters. I told them, That after they had such meetings, they did not wait upon God to seel his power to gather their minds inward, that they might seel his presence and power amongst them in their meetings, to sit down therein and wait upon him: for
<PB N="70" REF="037441_0147_100D8E8ADB815DD8"/>they had spoken themselves dry; they had spent their por∣tions, and not living in that which they spake of, they were now become dry. They had some kind of meetings still; but they took tobacco, and drank ale in their meetings, and were grown light and loose. But my message unto them from the Lord was, That they should all come together again, and wait to seel the Lord's power and Spirit in themselves; to gather them to Christ, that they might be taught of him, who says, "Learn of me." For when they had declared that which the Lord had opened to them, then the people were to receive it; and both the speakers and the hearers were to live in that themselves. But when these had no more to declare, but went to seek forms without life, that made themselves dry and barren, and the people also; and from thence came all their loss: for the Lord renews his mercies and his strength to them that wait upon him. The heads of them came to nothing: but most of the people were convinced, and received God's everlasting truth, and continue a meeting to this day, sitting under the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ their Saviour.</P>
<P>Upon the first day of the next week, the word of the Lord came to me to go to the steeple-house; which I did. When the priest had done, I spake the truth to him and the people, and directed them to their teacher within. Christ Jesus, their free teacher who had bought them. The priest came to me, and I had a little discourse with him; but he was soon stopped, and silent. Then, being clear of the place, I passed away, having had several meetings amongst those people.</P>
<P>Though the snow was very deep, I kept travelling; and came to a market-town, where I met with many professors, with whom I had much reasoning. I asked them many questions, which they were not able to answer; saying, They never had such deep questions put to them in their lives.</P>
<P>From them I went to Stath, where I met with many pro∣fessors, and some Ranters. I had large meetings amongst them, and a great convincement there was. Many received the truth: amongst whom one was a man of an hundred years of age; another was a chief constable; a third was a priest, whose name was Philip Scafe. Him the Lord, by his free Spirit, did afterwards make a free minister of his free gospel.</P>
<P>The priest of this town was a losty one, who much op∣pressed
<PB N="71" REF="037441_0148_100D8E8D14637B80"/>the people for his tythes. If they went a fishing many leagues off, he would exact the tythe-money of what they made of their fish, though they catched them at a great distance, and carried them as far as Yarmouth to sell. I was moved to go to the steeple-house there, to declare the truth, and lay open the priest. When I had spoken to him, and laid his oppressing of the people upon him, he fled away. The chief of the parish were very light and vain. After I had spoken the word of life to them, I turned away from them, because they did not receive it; and left them. But the word of the Lord, which I had declared amongst them, stuck with some, so that at night some of the heads of the parish came to me. Most of them were convinced and satisfied, and confessed to the truth. Thus the truth began to spread in that country, and great meetings we had; at which the priest began to rage, and the Ranters to be stirred; who sent me word they would have a dispute with me; both the oppressing priest and the leader of the Ranters. A day was fixed, and the Ranter came with his company. Another priest, a Scotchman, came; but not the oppressing priest of Stath. Philip Scafe was with me; and a great number of people met. When we were settled, T. Bushel, the Ranter, told me. He had had a vision of me, that I was sitting in a great chair, and that he was to come and put off his hat, and bow down to the ground before me; which he did. I told him, It was his own fi∣gure; and said, "Repent, thou beast." He said it was jea∣lousy in me to say so. I asked him the ground of jealousy, and how it came to be bred in man? And the nature of a beast, what made it, and how it was bred in man? For I saw him directly in that nature of the beast; and there∣fore I queried how that nature came to be bred in him? I told him. He should give me an account of things done in the body, before we came to discourse of things done out of the body. So I stopt his mouth, and his fellow Rant∣ers were silenced: for he was the head of them. Then I called for the oppressing priest; but only the Scotch priest came, whose mouth was soon stopt, with a very few words, he being out of the life of what he professed. Then I had good opportunity with the people. I laid open the Ranters, ranking them with the old Ranters in Sodom. The priests I maniselted to be of the same stamp with their fellow hirelings, the false prophets of old, and the priests that then bore rule over the people by their means, seeking their
<PB N="72" REF="037441_0149_100D8E8EB179C580"/>gain from their quarter, divining for money, and teaching for filthy lucre. I brought all the prophets, Christ and the apostles, over the heads of the priests, shewing how the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, had long since discover∣ed them by their marks and fruits. I directed the people to the inward teacher, Christ Jesus their Saviour; and preach∣ed up Christ in the hearts of his people, when all these mountains were laid low. The people were all quiet, and the gainsayers mouths were stopped; for though they broil∣ed inwardly, the divine power so bound them down, that they could not break out.</P>
<P>After the meeting, this Scottish priest desired me to walk with him atop of the cliffs. Whereupon I called a bro∣ther-in-law of his, who was in some measure convinced, and desired him to go with me, telling him, I was willing to have somebody by to hear what we said; lest the priest, when I was gone, should report any thing of me which I did not say. We went together, the priest asking me many things concerning the light, and concerning the soul; all which I answered him fully. When he had done question∣ing, we parted; and he went his way; and meeting with Philip Scafe, he brake his cane against the ground in mad∣ness, and said, If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I should have his; adding, that he would give his head, if I was not knocked down within a month. By this, friends suspected his intent was, in desiring me to walk with him alone, either to have thrust me down from the cliff, or to have done me some other mischief; and being frustrated, it made him rage. But I neither regarded his prophecies, nor his threats; for I feared God Almighty. After some years, this very Scotch priest and his wife came to be convinced of the truth; and about twelve years after I was at their house.</P>
<P>Another priest came to a meeting where I was; one in repute above all the priests in the country. As I was de∣claring, that the gospel was the power of God, and how it brought life and immortality to light in men, and was turn∣ing people from darkness to light; this high-flown priest said, The gospel was mortal. I told him, The true mi∣nister said, The gospel was the power of God; and would he make the power of God mortal? Upon that, the other priest Philip Scafe, that was convinced, and had felt the immortal power of God in himself, took him up and re∣proved him; so a great dispute arose between them: the
<PB N="73" REF="037441_0150_100D8E916FF93060"/>convinced priest holding that the gospel was immortal, and the other holding it was mortal. But the Lord's power was too hard for this opposer, and stopped his mouth; and many were convinced, seeing the darkness of the opposing priest, and the light that was in the convinced priest.</P>
<P>Another priest sent to have a dispute with me, and friends went with me to the house where he was; but when he un∣derstood we were come, he slipt out of the house, and hid himself under an hedge. The people went and found him, but could not get him to come to us. Then I went to a steeple-house hard by, where the priest and people were in a great rage: this priest had threatened friends what he would do: but when I came, he sled: for the Lord's pow∣er came over him and them. Yea, the Lord's everlasting power was over the world, and reached to the hearts of people, and made both priests and professors tremble. It shook the earthly and airy spirit, in which they held their profession of religion and worship; so that it was a dread∣ful thing to them, when it was told them, "The man in leathern breeches is come." At the hearing thereof the priests in many places got out of the way; they were so struck with the dread of the eternal power of God; and fear surprised the hypocrites.</P>
<P>We passed to Whitby and Scarborough, where we had some service for the Lord: large meetings are settled there since. From thence I passed over the Woulds to Malton, where we had great meetings, as we had also at the towns thereabouts. At one town a priest sent me a challenge to dispute with me; but when I came he would not come forth. I had a good opportunity with the people, and the Lord's power laid hold upon them. One, who had been a wild drunken man, was so reached, that he came to me as lowly as a lamb; though he and his companions had before sent for drink to make the people rude, on purpose that they might abuse us. When I found the priest would not come forth, I was moved to go to the steeple-house, and he was confounded; the Lord's power coming over all.</P>
<P>On first-day following, came one of the highest indepen∣dent professors, a woman, who had let in such a prejudice against me, that she said, before the came, She could wil∣lingly have gone to see me hanged. But coming, the was convinced, and remains a friend.</P>
<P>I turned to Malton again, and very great meetings there
<PB N="74" REF="037441_0151_100D8E93A26EED18"/>were; to which several more would have come, but durst not for fear of their relations; for it was thought a strange thing then to preach in houses, and not go to the church, as they called it; I was therefore much desired to go and speak in the steeple-houses. One of the priests wrote to me, and invited me to preach in his steeple-house, calling me his brother: another priest, a noted man, kept a lec∣ture there. The Lord shewed me, while I was in Derby prison, that I should speak in steeple-houses, to gather peo∣ple from thence; and a concern sometimes came upon my mind about the pulpits that the priests lolled in. For the steeple-houses and pulpits were offensive to my mind, be∣cause both priests and people called them the house of God, and idolized them; reckoning that God dwelt in the outward house. Whereas they should have looked for God and Christ to dwell in their hearts, and their bodies to be made the temples of God; for the apostle said, <Q>God dwelleth not in temples made with hands:</Q> but by rea∣son of the people's idolizing those places, it was counted an heinous thing to declare against them. When I came into the steeple-house, there were not above eleven hearers, and the priest was preaching to them. But after it was known in the town that I was there, it was soon filled with people. When the priest had done, he sent the other priest who had invited me thither, to bring me into the pul∣pit; but I sent him word, that I needed not go into the pulpit. He sent to me again, desiring me to go up into it; for, he said, it was a better place, and there I might be seen of the people. I sent him word again, I could be seen and heard well enough where I was; and that I came not there to hold up such places, nor their main∣tenance and trade. Upon this they began to be angry, and said, <Q>These false prophets were to come in the last times.</Q> Their saying so grieved many of the people, and some began to murmur at it. Whereupon I desired all to be quiet; and, stepping upon an high seat, declared to them the marks of the false prophets, shewing that they were already come; and set the true prophets, Christ, and his apostles over them; and manifested these to be out of the steps of the true prophets, of Christ and his apostles. I directed the people to their inward teacher, Christ Jesus, who would turn them from darkness to light. And having opened divers scriptures to them, I directed them to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might come to
<PB N="75" REF="037441_0152_100D8E95F34CD000"/>him, and by which they might also come to know who the false prophets were. So having had a large opportunity among them, I departed in peace.</P>
<P>After some time, I came to Pickering, where in the stee∣ple-house the justices held their sessions, justice Robinson being chairman. I had a meeting in the school-house at the same time; and abundance of priests and professors came to it, asking questions, which were answered to their satis∣faction. It being sessions-time, four chief constables and many other people were convinced that day; and word was carried to justice. Robinson that his priest was overthrown and convinced; whom he had a love to, more than to all the priests besides. After the meeting, we went to an inn, Justice Robinson's priest was very lowly and loving, and would have paid for my dinner; but I would by no means suffer it. Then he offered me his steeple-house to preach in; but I refused it, and told him and the people, that I came to bring them off from such things to Christ.</P>
<P>The next morning I went with the four chief constables and some others, to visit justice Robinson, who met me at his chamber-door. I told him, I could not honour him with man's honour. He said he did not look for it. So I went into his chamber, and opened to him the state of the false prophets, and of the true prophets; and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the true prophets, Christ, and the apostles, over the other; and di∣rected his mind to Christ his teacher. I opened to him the parables, and how election and reprobation stood; as that reprobation stood in the first birth, and election in the se∣cond birth. I shewed also what the promise of God was to, and what the judgment of God was against. He confessed to it all, and was so opened with the truth, that when an∣other justice made some little opposition, he informed him. At our parting, he said, It was very well that I did exer∣cise that gift which God had given me. He took the chief constables aside, and would have given them some money for me, saying. He would not have me be at any charge in their country; but they told him, they themselves could not get me to take any money; and so accepting his kind∣ness, I refused his money.</P>
<P>From thence I passed into the country, and the priest that called me brother (in whose school-house I had the meeting at Pickering) went along with me. When we came into a town to bait, the bells rang. I asked what they rang for? They said, For me to preach in the steeple-house.
<PB N="76" REF="037441_0153_100D8E98654E8D68"/>After some time I felt drawings that way: and as I walked to the steeple-house, I saw the people gathered together in the yard. The old priest would have had me gone into the steeple-house. I said, It was no matter. But it was some∣thing strange to the people, that I would not go into that which they called the house of God. I stood up in the steeple-house yard, and declared to the people, That I came not to hold up their idol-temples, nor their priests, nor their tythes, nor their augmentations, nor their priests-wa∣ges, nor their Jewish and heathenish ceremonies and tradi∣tions (for I denied all these) and told them, that piece of ground was no more holy than another piece of ground. I shewed them, that the apostles going into the Jews syna∣gogues and temples, which God had commanded, was to bring people off from that temple, and those synagogues, and from the offerings, tythes, and covetous priests of that time; that such as came to be convinced of the truth, con∣verted to it, and believed in Jesus Christ, whom the apos∣tles preached, met together in dwelling-houses; and that all who preach Christ, the Word of life, ought to preach freely, as the apostles did, and as he commanded. So I was sent of the Lord God of heaven and earth to preach freely, and to bring people off from these outward temples made with hands, which God dwelleth not in; that they might know their bodies to become the temples of God and of Christ; and to draw people off from all their superstitious ceremonies, Jewish and heathenish customs, traditions, and doctrines of men; and from all the world's hireling teach∣ers, that take tythes and great wages, preaching for hire, and divining for money, whom God and Christ never sent, as themselves confess, when they say, They never heard God's nor Christ's voice. I exhorted the people to come off from all these things, directing them to the Spirit and grace of God in themselves, and to the light of Jesus in their own hearts; that they might come to know Christ, their free teacher, to bring them salvation, and to open the scrip∣tures to them. Thus the Lord gave me a good opportunity to open things largely unto them. All was quiet, and many were convinced: blessed be the Lord.</P>
<P>I passed to another town, where was another great meet∣ing, the old priest being with me; and there came profes∣sors of several sorts to it. I sate on a hay-stack, and spoke nothing for some hours; for I was to famish them from words. The professors would ever and anon be speaking to
<PB N="77" REF="037441_0154_100D8E9A74284B80"/>the old priest, and asking him when I would begin, and when I would speak? He bade them wait; and told them, that the people waited upon Christ a long while before he spoke. At last I was moved of the Lord to speak; and they were struck by the Lord's power. The word of life reached to them, and there was a general convincement amongst them.</P>
<P>From hence I passed on, the old priest being still with me, and several others. As we went along, some people called to him and said, <Q>Mr. Boyes, we owe you some money for tythes, pray come and take it.</Q> But he threw up his hands, and said, <Q>He had enough, he would have none of it; they might keep it:</Q> and, <Q>he praised the Lord he had enough.</Q></P>
<P>At length we came to his steeple-house in the Moors, and he went before me, and held open the pulpit door; but I told him I would not go into it. This steeple-house was very much painted. I told him and the people, the painted beast had a painted house. I opened to them the rise of those houses; and their superstitious ways; shewing them, that as the end of the apostles going into the temple and synagogues, which God had commanded, was not to hold them up, but to bring them to Christ the substance; so the end of my coming there was not to hold up these temples, priests, and tythes, which God had never com∣manded, but to bring them from all these things to Christ the substance. I shewed them the true worship which Christ had set up, and distinguished Christ the true way from all the false ways, opening the parables to them, and turning them from darkness to the true light, that by it they might see themselves, their sins, and Christ their Saviour; that believing in him they might be saved from their sins.</P>
<P>After this we went to one Birdet's, where I had a great meeting; and this old priest accompanied me still, leaving his steeple-house. He had been looked upon as a famous priest, above common-prayermen, presbyters, and inde∣pendents too. Before he was convinced he went sometimes into their steeple-houses, and preached; for he had been a zealous man in his way: and when they complained of him to justice Hotham, he bid them distrain his horse for travel∣ling on the Lord's day, as he called it; but Hotham did that to put them off, for he knew the priest used no horse, but travelled on foot.</P>
<P>Now I came towards Crantsick to captain Pursloe's and
<PB N="78" REF="037441_0155_100D8E9C8EA06E38"/>justice Hotham's, who received me kindly, being glad the Lord's power had so appeared, that truth was spread and so many had received it, and that justice Robinson was so civil. Justice Hotham said, If God had not raised up this principle of light and life, which I preached, the nation had been over-run with Ranterism, and all the justices in the nation could not have stopped it with all their laws; be∣cause, said he, they would have said as we said, and done as we commanded, and yet have kept their own principle still. But this principle of truth overthrows their principle in the root and ground thereof; therefore he was glad the Lord had raised up this principle of life and truth.</P>
<P>From thence I travelled into Holderness, and came to a justice's house, whose name was Pearson, where was a very tender woman, that believed in the truth, and was so af∣fected therewith, that she said, <Q>She could have left all and have followed me.</Q></P>
<P>Thence I went to Oram, to George Hartise's; where many of that town were convinced. On the first-day I was moved to go into the steeple-house, where the priest had got another to help him: and many professors and con∣tenders were got together. But the Lord's power was over all; the priests fled away, and a great deal of good service I had for the Lord amongst the people. Some of those great professors were convinced, and became honest faithful friends; being men of account in that place.</P>
<P>The next day, friends and friendly people having left me, I travelled alone, declaring the day of the Lord amongst people in the towns where I came, and warning them to repent. I came towards night into a town called Patring∣ton. As I walked along the town, I warned both priests and people (for the priest was in the street) to repent and turn to the Lord. It grew dark before I came to the end of the town, and a multitude of people gathered about me, to whom I declared the word of life.</P>
<P>When I had cleared myself I went to an inn, and de∣sired them to let me have a lodging; but they would not. I desired a little meat or milk, and I would pay for it; but they refused. So I walked out of the town, and a company of fellows followed, and asked me, What news? I bid them repent, and fear the Lord. After I was gone a pretty way, I came to another house, and desired the people to let me have a little meat, drink, and lodging for my money; but they denied me. I went to another house, and desired the
<PB N="79" REF="037441_0156_100D8E9EC14706C0"/>same; but they refused me also. By this time it was grown so dark that I could not see the highway; but I discerned a ditch, and got a little water and refreshed myself. Then I got over the ditch; and, being weary with travelling, I sate down amongst the furze bushes till it was day. About break of day I got up, and passed on the fields. A man came after me with a great pikestaff, and went along with me to a town; and he raised the town upon me, with the constable and chief constable, before the sun was up. I declared God's everlasting truth amongst them, warning them of the day of the Lord, that was coming upon all sin and wickedness; and exhorted them to repent. But they seized me, and had me back to Patrington, about three miles, guarding me with watch-bills, pikes, staves, and hal∣berds. When I was come to Patrington, all the town was in an uproar, and the priest and constables were consulting together; so I had another opportunity to declare the word of life amongst them, and warn them to repent. At last a professor, a tender man, called me into his house, and there I took a little milk and bread, having not eaten for some days before. Then they guarded me about nine miles to a justice. When I was come near his house, a man came riding after us, and asked me, whether I was the man that was apprehended? I asked him, wherefore he asked? He said, for no hurt. I told him, I was: so he rode away to the justice before us. The men that guarded me said, It was well if the justice was not drunk before we got to him; for he used to get drunk early. When I was brought in before him, because I did not put off my hat, and said Thou to him, he asked the man that rode thither before me, whe∣ther I was not mazed or fond? The man told him, no; it was my principle. I warned him to repent, and come to the light, which Christ had enlightened him withal; that by it he might see all his evil words and actions, and turn to Christ Jesus whilst he had time; and that whilst he had time he should prize it. Ay, ay, said he, the light that is spoken of in the third of John. I desired he would mind it, and obey it. As I admonished him, I laid my hand upon him, and he was brought down by the power of the Lord; and all the watchmen stood amazed. Then he took me into a little parlour with the other man, and desired to see what I had in my pockets of letters or intelligence. I plucked out my linen, and shewed him I had no letters. He said, he is not a vagrant by his linen: then he set me at
<PB N="80" REF="037441_0157_100D8EA0EC481328"/>liberty. I went back to Patrington with the man that had rode before me to the justice: for he lived at Patrington. When I came there, he would have had me had a meeting at the Cross; but I said, it was no matter, his house would serve. He desired me to go to bed, or lie down upon a bed; which he did, that they might say they had seen me in or upon a bed, for they had got a report that I would not lie on any bed, because I laid many times without doors. When first-day was come I went to the steeple-house, and declared the truth to the priest and people; and the people did not molest me, for the power of God was come over them. Presently after I had a great meeting at the man's house where I lay, and many were convinced of the Lord's everlasting truth, who stand faithful witnesses of it to this day; and they were exceedingly grieved that they did not receive me, nor give me lodging, when I was there before.</P>
<P>From hence I travelled through the country to the fur∣thest part thereof, warning people in towns and villages to repent, and directing them to Christ Jesus, their teacher.</P>
<P>On first-day I came to colonel Overton's, and had a great meeting of the prime of the people of that country, where many things were opened out of the scriptures, which they had never heard before. Many were convinced, and re∣ceived the word of life, and were settled in the truth of God.</P>
<P>I returned to Patrington again, and visited those friends that were convinced there; by whom I understood, that taylor and some wild blades in that town had occasioned my being carried before the justice. The taylor came to ask me forgiveness, fearing I would complain of him. The constables also were afraid, lest I should trouble them. But I forgave them all, and warned them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their lives. That which made them the more afraid was this: when I was in the steeple-house at Oram not long before, a professor gave me a push on the breast in the steeple-house, and bid me get out of the church. Alas! poor man! said I, dost thou call the steeple-house the church? The church is the people whom God hath purchased with his blood, and not the house. It happen∣ed that justice Hotham came to hear of this man's abuse, sent his warrant for him, and bound him over to the ses∣sions; so affected was he with the truth, and so zealous to keep the peace: and indeed this justice had asked me be∣fore,
<PB N="81" REF="037441_0158_100D8EA3C9210170"/>whether any had meddled with me or abused me? But I was not to tell him any thing of that kind; but was to forgive all.</P>
<P>From Patrington I went to several great men's houses, warning them to repent. Some received me lovingly, and some slighted me. At night I came to another town, where I desired lodging and meat, and I would pay for it; but they would not lodge me, except I would go to the consta∣ble, which was the custom (they said) of all lodgers at inns, if strangers. I told them, I would not go; for that custom was for suspicious persons, I was an innocent man. After I had warned them to repent, declared to them the day of their visitation, and directed them to the light of Christ and the spirit of God, that they might come to know salvation, I passed away; and the people were somewhat tendered and troubled afterwards. When it grew dark, I spied a hay-stack, and went and sate under it till morning.</P>
<P>The next day I passed into Hull, admonishing and warn∣ing people, as I went, to turn to Christ Jesus, that they might receive salvation. That night I got a lodging; but was very sore with travelling on foot so far.</P>
<P>Afterwards I came to Balby, visited friends up and down in those parts, and then passed into the edge of Nottingham∣shire, visiting friends there: and so into Lincolnshire, and visited friends there. On first-day I went to a steeple-house on this side of Trent, and in the afternoon to another on the other side of Trent, declaring the word of life to the people, and directing them to their teacher Christ Jesus, who died for them, that they might hear him and receive salvation by him. Then I went further into the country, and had seve∣ral meetings. To one meeting came a great man, a priest, and many professors; but the Lord's power came over them all, and they went their way peaceably. There came a man to that meeting, who had been at one before, and raised a false accusation against me, and made a noise up and down the country, reporting, that I said I was Christ; which was utterly false. When I came to Gainsborough, where a friend had been declaring truth in the market, the town and market-people were all in an uproar. I went into a friendly man's house, and the people rushed in after me; so that the house was filled with professors, disputers, and rude people. This false accuser came in, and charged me openly before the people, <Q>That I said I was Christ, and he had got witnesses to prove it.</Q> Which put the people into such a rage, that they had much to do
<PB N="82" REF="037441_0159_100D8EA55D4535B8"/>to keep their hands off me. I was moved of the Lord to stand up upon the table, in the eternal power of God, and tell the people, <Q>That Christ was in them, except they were reprobates; and that it was Christ, the eternal power of God, that spoke in me at that time unto them; NOT that I was CHRIST.</Q> And the people were greatly satis∣fied, except himself, a professor, and his own false witnesses. I called the accuser Judas, and was moved to tell him that Judas's end should be his; that was the word of the Lord and of Christ through me to him. The Lord's power came over all, and quieted the minds of the people, and they de∣parted in peace. But this Judas shortly after hanged him∣self, and a stake was driven into his grave. Afterwards the wicked priests raised a scandal upon us, and reported that a Quaker had hanged himself in Lincolnshire, and had a stake driven through him. This falsehood they printed to the nation, adding sin to sin; which the truth and we were clear of: for he was no more a Quaker than the priest that printed it, but one of their own people. Notwith∣standing this wicked slander by which the adversary design∣ed to defame us, and turn people's minds against the truth we held forth, many in Lincolnshire received the gospel, being convinced of the Lord's everlasting truth, and sate down therein under his heavenly teaching.</P>
<P>I passed in the Lord's power into Yorkshire, came to Warnsworth, and went to the steeple-house in the forenoon; but they shut the door against me: yet after awhile they let in Thomas Aldam, and then shut it again; and the priest fell upon him, asking him questions. At last they opened the door, and I went in. As soon as I was come in the priest's sight he left preaching, though I said nothing to him; and asked me, "What have you to say?" and presently cried out. <Q>Come, come, I will prove them false prophets in Matthew.</Q> But he was so confounded, he could not sind the chapter. Then he sell on me, asking me many questions; and I stood still all this while, not saying any thing amongst them. At last I said, <Q>Seeing here are so many questions asked, I may answer them.</Q> But as soon as I began to speak, the people violently rushed upon me, thrust me out of the steeple-house again, and locked the door against me. As soon as they had done their ser∣vice, and were come forth, the people ran upon me, knock∣ed me sorely with their staves, threw clods and stones at me, and abused me much: the priest also, being in a great rage,
<PB N="83" REF="037441_0160_100D8EA7695FC430"/>laid violent hands on me himself. I warned them and him of the terrible day of the Lord, and exhorted them to re∣pent and turn to Christ. Being filled with the Lord's re∣freshing power, I was not sensible of much hurt I had re∣ceived by their blows. In the afternoon I went to another steeple-house, but the priest had done before I got thither: so I preached repentance to the people that were left, and directed them to their inward teacher, Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Balby, and Doucaster, where I had formerly preached repentance on the market-day; which had made a noise and alarm in the country. On first-day I went to the steeple-house, and after the priest had done, I spoke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me: and they were in a great rage, hurried me out, threw me down, and haled me before the magistrates. A long ex∣amination they made of me, and much work I had with them. They threatened my life, if ever I came there again; and that they would leave me to the mercy of the people. Nevertheless I declared truth amongst them, and directed them to the light of Christ in them; testifying unto them, <Q>That God was come to teach his people himself, whether they would hear or forbear.</Q> After awhile they put us out (for some friends were with me) among the rude multi∣tude, and they stoned us down the streets. An innkeep∣er, a bailiff, came and took us into his house; and they broke his head, so that the blood ran down his face, with the stones that they threw at us. We staid awhile in his house, and shewed the more sober people the priest's fruits. Then we went away to Balby about a mile off. The rude people laid wait for us, and stoned us down the lane; but, blessed be the Lord, we did not receive much hurt.</P>
<P>The next first-day I went to Tickhill, whither the friends of that side gathered together, and a mighty brokenness by the power of God there was amongst the people. I went out of the meeting, being moved of God to go to the stee∣ple-house. When I came there, I found the priest and most of the chief of the parish together in the chancel. I went up to them, and began to speak; but they immediate∣ly fell upon me; the clerk up with his bible, as I was speaking, and <Q>struck me on the face with it, so that my face gushed out with blood; and I bled exceedingly in the steeple-house.</Q> The people cried, <Q>Let us have him out of the church.</Q> When they had got me out, they beat me exceedingly, threw me down, and turned me
<PB N="84" REF="037441_0161_100D8EA9B4AF7CE0"/>over a hedge. They afterwards dragged me through a house into the street, stoning and beating me as they dragged me along; so that I was all over besmeared with blood and dirt. They got my hat from me, which I never had again. Yet when I was got upon my legs, I declared the word of life, shewed them the fruits of their teacher, and how they dishonoured christianity. After awhile I got into the meet∣ing again amongst friends, and the priest and people coming by the house, I went with friends into the yard, and there spoke to the priest and people. The priest scof∣fed at us, and called us Quakers. But the Lord's power was so over them, and the word of life was declared in such authority and dread to them, that the priest fell a trembling himself; and one of the people said, <Q>Look how the priest trembles and shakes, he is turned a Quaker also.</Q> When the meeting was over, friends departed; and I went with∣out my hat to Balby about seven or eight miles. Friends were much abused that day by the priest and his people: insomuch that some moderate justices hearing of it, two or three of them came and sate at the town to examine the business. He that had shed my blood was afraid of having his hand cut off, for striking me in the church, as they cal∣led it; but I forgave him, and would not appear against him.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this year 1652, great rage got up in priests and people, and in some of the magistrates, in the west riding of Yorkshire, against the truth and friends, in∣somuch, that the priest of Warnsworth procured a warrant from the justices against me and Thomas Aldam, to be ex∣ecuted in any part of the west riding of Yorkshire. At the same time I had a vision of a bear and two great mastiff dogs; that I should pass by them, and they should do me no hurt: and it proved so. For the constable took Tho∣mas Aldam, and carried him to York. I went with Thomas twenty miles towards York, and the constable had a war∣rant for me also, and said, <Q>He saw me, but he was loth to trouble strangers;</Q> but Thomas Aldam was his neigh∣bour. So the Lord's power restrained him, that he had not power to meddle with me. We went to lieutenant Roper's, where we had a great meeting of many considerable men. The truth was powerfully declared amongst them, the scrip∣tures wonderfully opened, the parables and sayings of Christ expounded, the state of the church in the apostles days plainly set forth, and the apostacy since from that state dis∣covered.
<PB N="85" REF="037441_0162_100D8EAC45B4E060"/>The truth had great dominion that day: so that those great men present did generally confess to it, saying, <Q>They believed this principle must go over the whole world.</Q> There were at this meeting James Nayler, Tho∣mas Goodyear, and William Dewsbury, who had been con∣vinced the year before, and Richard Farnsworth also. The constable staid with Thomas Aldam till the meeting was over, and then went towards York prison; but did not meddle with me.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Wakefield, and the first-day after to a steeple-house, where James Nayler had been a mem∣ber of an independent church; but, upon his receiving truth, he was excommunicated. When I came in, and the priest had done, the people called me to come to the priest; which I did: but when I began to declare the word of life to them, and to lay open the deceit of the priest, they rushed upon me on a sudden, thrust me out at the other door, punching and beating me, and cried <Q>Let us have him to the stocks.</Q> But the Lord's power was over them, and so restrained them, that they were not able to put me in. So I passed away to the meeting, where were a great many professors and friendly people gathered, and a great convincement there was; for the people were mightily sa∣tisfied, that they were directed to the Lord's teaching in themselves. Here we got lodging; for four of us had lain abroad under a hedge the night before, there being then few friends in that place.</P>
<P>The same day Richard Farnsworth went to another great steeple-house belonging to a high priest, and declared the word of truth unto the people; and great service he had amongst them: for the Lord's dread and power was mighti∣ly over all.</P>
<P>The priest of that church, which James Nayler had been a member of, whose name was Marshal, raised many wicked slanders upon me, <Q>That I carried bottles about with me, and made people drink of my bottles, which made them follow me.</Q> And, <Q>That I rid upon a great black horse, and was seen in one country upon my black horse in one hour, and in the same hour in another country threescore miles off;</Q> and <Q>That I should give a fellow money to follow me when I was on my black horse.</Q> With these hellish lies he fed his people, to make them think evil of the truth which I had declared amongst them. But by these lies he preached many of his hearers away
<PB N="86" REF="037441_0163_100D8EADDA1C7A90"/>from him; for I travelled on foot, and had no horse at that time; and that the people generally knew. The Lord soon after met with this envious priest, and cut him off in his wickedness.</P>
<P>After this I came to High-Town, where dwelt a woman who had been convinced a little before. We went to her house, and had a meeting. The town's people gathered to∣gether; we declared the truth to them, had some service for the Lord amongst them; and they passed away again peaceably. But there was a widow woman in the town, whose name was Green, who, being filled with envy, went to one called a gentleman in the town, who was reported to have killed two men and one woman, and informed him against us, though he was no officer. The next morning we drew up some queries, to be sent to the priest. When we had done, and were just going away, some of the friend∣ly people of the town came running, and told us, That this murdering man had sharpened a pike to stab us, and was coming with his sword by his side. Being just pas∣sing away, we missed him. But he came to the house where we had been; and the people generally concluded, if we had not been gone, he would have murdered some of us. That night we lay in a wood, and were very wet, for it rained exceedingly. In the morning I was moved to return to that town, when we had a full relation of this wicked man.</P>
<P>From hence we passed to an house at Bradford, where we met with Richard Farnsworth, from whom we had parted a little before. When we came in they set meat before us; but as I was going to eat, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <Q>Eat not the bread of such as have an evil eye.</Q> Immediately I arose from the table, and ate no∣thing. After I had exhorted the family to turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, and hearken to his teachings in their own hearts, we departed thence.</P>
<P>As we travelled through the country, preaching repent∣ance to the people, we came into a market-town, where a lecture was held that day. I went into the steeple-house, where many priests, professors and people were. The priest that preached, took for his text those words of Jeremiah, chap. 5. ver. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. "My people love to have it so;" leaving out the foregoing words, viz. <Q>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means.</Q> I shewed the people his deceit; and directed them to Christ,
<PB N="87" REF="037441_0164_100D8EB0378A3F18"/>the true teacher within; declaring, that God was come to teach his people himself, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers and hirelings; that they might come to re∣ceive freely from him. Then warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all flesh, I passed from thence without much opposition.</P>
<P>At night we came to a country place, where there was no publick house near. The people desired us to stay all night; which we did, and had good service for the Lord, declaring his truth amongst them.</P>
<P>The Lord had said unto me, <Q>If but one man or woman were raised by his power, to stand and live in the same Spirit that the prophets and apostles were in who gave forth the scriptures, that man or woman should shake all the country in their profession for ten miles round.</Q> For people had the scriptures, but were not in the same light, power, and Spirit, which those were in who gave forth the scriptures; so they neither knew God, Christ, nor the scrip∣tures aright; nor had they unity one with another, being out of the power and Spirit of God. Therefore we warned all, where-ever we met them, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</P>
<P>As we travelled, we came near a very great high hill, called Pendlehill, and I was moved of the Lord to go up to the top of it; which I did with much ado, it was so very steep and high. When I was come to the top, I saw the sea bordering upon Lancashire. From the top of this hill the Lord let me see in what places he had a great peo∣ple to be gathered. As I went down, I found a spring of water in the side of the hill, with which I refreshed myself; having eaten or drunk but little several days before.</P>
<P>At night we came to an inn, and declared truth to the man of the house, and wrote a paper to the priests and pro∣fessors, declaring <Q>the day of the Lord, and that Christ was come to teach people himself, by his power and Spi∣rit in their hearts, and to bring people off from all the world's ways and teachers, to his own free teaching who had bought them, and was the Saviour of all them that believed in him.</Q> The man of the house spread the pa∣per abroad, and was himself mightily affected with the truth. Here the Lord opened unto me, and let me see a great people in white raiment by a river-side, coming to the Lord. The place that I saw them in was about Went∣zerdale and Sedbergh.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="037441_0165_100D8EB3571F0970"/>
The next day we travelled on, and at night got a little fern to put under us, and lay upon a common. Next morning we reached a town, where Richard Farnsworth parted from me; and then I travelled alone again. I came up Wentzerdale, and at the market-town in that dale there was a lecture on the market-day. I went into the steeple-house; and after the priest had done, <Q>proclaimed the day of the Lord to the priest and people; warning them to turn from the darkness to the light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might come to know God and Christ aright, and to receive his teaching, who teach∣eth freely.</Q> Largely and freely did I declare the word of life unto them, and had not much persecution there. After∣wards I passed up the dales, warning people to fear God; and preaching the everlasting gospel. In my way I came to a great house, where was a schoolmaster; and they got me into the house. I asked them questions about then re∣ligion and worship; and afterwards declared the truth to them. They had me into a parlour, and locked me in, pretending I was mad, and had got away from my rela∣tions; and they would keep me till they could send to them. But I soon convinced them of their mistake; and they let me forth, and would have had me to stay, but I was not to stay there. Having exhorted them to repentance, and directed them to the light of Christ Jesus, that thro' it they might come unto him, and be saved, I passed from them, and came in the night to a little alehouse on a com∣mon, where a company of rude fellows were drinking. Because I would not drink with them, they struck me with their clubs. But I reproved them, and brought them to be somewhat cooler; and then walked out of the house upon the common in the night. After some time one of these drunken fellows came out, and would have come close up to me, pretending to whisper to me; but perceiving he had a knife, I kept off him, and bid him repent, and fear God. So the Lord by his power preserved me from this wicked man; and he went into the house again. Next morning I went through other dales, warning and exhorting people every where, as I passed, to repent and turn to the Lord; and several were convinced. At one house, the man of the house whom I afterwards sound to be a kinsman of John Blakelin's, would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</P>
<P>As I travelled through the dales, I came to another
<PB N="89" REF="037441_0166_100D7F458D51D5F8"/>man's house, whose name was Tennant. I was moved to speak to the family, and declare God's everlasting truth to them; and as I was turning away from them, I was moved to turn again, and speak to the man himself; who was con∣vinced, with his family, and lived and died in the truth. Thence I came to major Bousfield's, who received me, as did several others. Some that were then convinced have stool faithful ever since. I went also through Grysedale, and several other of those dales; in which some were con∣vinced. In Dent many were convinced also. From major Bousfield's I came to Richard Robinson's and declared the everlasting truth to him.</P>
<P>The next day I went to a meeting at justice Benson's, where met a people that were separated from the publick worship. This was the place that I had seen, where a peo∣ple came forth in white raiment. A large meeting it was; the people were generally convinced, and continue a large meeting still of friends near Sedbergh; which was then first gathered through my ministry in the name of Jesus.</P>
<P>The same week there was a great fair, at which servants used to be hired. I went and declared the day of the Lord through the fair. After I had done so, I went into the steeple-house yard; and many of the people of the fair came to me, with abundance of priests and professors. <Q>There I declared the everlasting truth of the Lord, and the word of life for several hours; shewing, that the Lord was come to teach his people himself, and to bring them off from all the world's ways and teachers to Christ the true teacher, and the true way to God. I laid open their teachers, shewing, that they were like those that were of old condemned by the prophets, by Christ, and by the apostles. I exhorted the people to come off from the temples made with hands; and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know themselves to be the temples of God.</Q> Not one of the priests had power to open his mouth against what I declared. At last a cap∣tain said, <Q>Why will you not go into the Church? This is not a fit place to preach in.</Q> I told him, I denied their church. Then stood up Francis Howgill, who was preach∣er to a congregation. He had not seen me before; yet he undertook to answer that captain; and soon put him to silence. Then said Francis Howgill of me, <Q>This man speaks with authority, and not as the scribes.</Q> After this, I opened to the people, that that ground and house was no
<PB N="90" REF="037441_0167_100D8EB6F59909F0"/>holier than another place; and that the house is not the church, but the people, whom Christ is the head of. After awhile the priests came up to me, and I warned them to repent. One of them said, I was mad; so they turned away. But many were convinced there that day, who were glad to hear the truth declared, and received it with joy. Amongst these was captain Ward, who received the truth in the love of it, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>The next first-day I came to Firbank Chapel in West∣moreland, where Francis Howgill and John Audland had been preaching in the morning. The chapel was full of people, so that many could not get in. Francis said, He thought I looked into the chapel, and his spirit was ready to sail, the Lord': power did so surprize him: but I did not look in. They made haste, and had quickly done, and they and some of the people went to dinner; but abundance staid till they came again. John Blakelin and others came to me, and desired me not to reprove them publickly; for they were not parish-teachers, but pretty tender men. I could nor tell them whether I should or no, though I had not at that time any drawings to declare publickly against them; but I said, They must leave me to the Lord's mov∣ings. While others were gone to dinner, I went to a brook, got a little water, and then came and sat down on the top of a rock hard by the chapel. In the afternoon the people gathered about me, with several of their preachers. It was judged there were above a thousand people; to whom I declared God's everlasting truth and word of life freely and largely for about the space of three hours; directing all to the Spirit of God in themselves; that they might be turned from darkness to light, and believe in it, that they might become the children of it, and might be turned from the power of Satan unto God; and by the Spirit of truth might be led into all truth, and sensibly understand the words of the prophets, of Christ, and of the apostles; and might all come to know Christ to be their teacher to instruct them, their counsellor to direct them, their shepherd to seed them, their bishop to oversee them, and their prophet to open di∣vine mysteries to them; and might know their bodies to be prepared, sanctified, and made sit temples for God and Christ to dwell in. In the openings of heavenly life. I explained unto them the prophets, and the figures and sha∣dows, and directed them to Christ, the substance. Then I opened the parables and sayings of Christ, and things that
<PB N="91" REF="037441_0168_100D8EB8E5DDF458"/>had been long hid; shewing the intent and scope of the apos∣tles writings and that their epistles were written to the elect. When I had opened that state, I shewed also the state of the apostacy since the apostles days; that the priests have got the scriptures, but are not in the Spirit which gave them forth; and have put them into chapter and verse, to make a trade of the holy mens words; that the teachers and priests now are found in the steps of the false prophets, chief priests, scribes and pharisees of old, and are such as the true prophets, Christ and his apostles cried against, and so are judged and condemned by the Spirit of the true pro∣phets, of Christ, and of his apostles; and that none in that Spirit could own them. Many old people went into the chapel, and looked out at the windows; thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strange thing to see a man preach on an hill or mountain, and not in their church, as they called it; whereupon I was moved to inform the people, <Q>That the steeple-house, and the ground whereon it stood, were no more holy than that mountain; and that those temples, which they called the dreadful houses of God, were not set up by the com∣mand of God and of Christ; nor their priests called, as Aaron's priesthood was; nor their tythes appointed by God, as those amongst the Jews were: but that Christ was come, who ended both the temple and its worship, and the priests and their tythes; and all now should hearken to him: for he said, "Learn of me:" and God said of him, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</Q> I declared that the Lord God had sent me to preach the everlasting gospel and word of life amongst them; and to bring them off from all these temples, tythes, priests, and rudiments of the world, which had got up since the apostles days, and had been set up by such as had erred from the Spirit and power that the apostles were in.</Q> Very largely was I opened at this meet∣ing; the Lord's convincing power accompanied my mini∣stry, and reached home to the hearts of the people; where∣by many were convinced, and all the teachers of that con∣gregation (who were many) were convinced of God's ever∣lasting truth.</P>
<P>After the meeting, I went to John Audland's, and from thence to Preston Patrick Chapel, where a great meeting was appointed; to which I went, and had a large opportu∣nity to preach the everlasting gospel; acquainting the peo∣ple that the end of my coming into that place was not to
<PB N="92" REF="037441_0169_100D8EBB51C68980"/>hold it up; no more than the apostles going into the Jew∣ish synagogues and temple was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> uphold those; but to bring them off from all such things (as the apostles brought the saints of old from off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jewish temple and Aaron's priesthood) that they might come to witness their bodies to be the temples of God, and Christ in them to be their teacher.</P>
<P>From this place I went to Kendal, where a meeting was appointed in the town-hall, in which I declared the word of life amongst the people, shewing them, <Q>How they might come to the saving knowledge of Christ, and to have a right understanding of the holy scriptures; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the way of reconciliation with God; and what would be their con∣demnation.</Q> After the meeting I staid awhile in the town: several were convinced there, and many appeared loving. One Cork met me in the street, and would have given me a roll of tobacco. I accepted his love, but did not receive the tobacco.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Under-barrow, to Miles Bate∣man's; and several going along with me, great reasonings I had with them, especially with Edward Burrough. At night the priest and many professors came to the house; and a great deal of disputing I had with them. Supper being provided for the priest and the rest of the company. I had not freedom to eat with them; but told them, If they would appoint a meeting for the next day at the steeple-house, and acquaint the people with it, I might meet them. They had a great deal of reassoning about it; some being for, and some against it. In the morning, after I had spoken to them again concerning the meeting, as I walked upon a bank by the house, there came several poor travellers, asking relief, who I saw were in necessity; and they gave them nothing, but said they were cheats. It grieved me to see such hard-heartedness amongst professors; whereupon, when they were gone in to their breakfast, I ran after the poor people about a quarter of a mile, and gave them some money. Mean while some that were in the house, coming out, and seeing me a quarter of a mile off, said, I could not have gone so far in such an instant, if I had not had wings. Hereupon the meeting was like to have been put by; for they were filled with such strange thoughts concerning me, that many of them were against having a meeting with me. I told them. I ran after those poor people to give them sorme mo∣ney;
<PB N="93" REF="037441_0170_100D8EBDB573E620"/>being grieved at their hard-heartedness, who gave them nothing. Then came Miles and Stephen Hubbersty; who, being more simple-hearted men, would have the meeting held. So to the chapel I went, and the priest came. A great meeting there was, and the way of life and salvation was opened; and after awhile the priest fled away. Many of Crook and Under-barrow were convinced that day, re∣ceived the word of life, and stood fast in it under the teach∣ing of Christ Jesus. After I had declared the truth to them for some hours, and the meeting was ended, the chief con∣stable and some other professors fell to reasoning with me in the chapel yard. Whereupon I took a bible and opened the scriptures. and dealt tenderly with them, as one would do with a child. They that were in the light of Christ and Spirit of God, knew when I spake scripture, though I did not mention chapter and verse, after the priests for to them.</P>
<P>From hence I went with an ancient man, whose heart the Lord had opened, and he invited me to his house; his name was Jatnes Dickinson. He was convinced that day, received the truth, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>I came the next day to James Taylor's, of Newton in Cartmel, in Lancashire. On first-day I went to the chapel, where priest Camelford used to preach; and after he had done, I began to speak the word of life to the people. But he was in such a rage, did so fret, and was so peevish, that he had no patience to hear; but stirred up the rude multi∣tude, who haled me out, struck, and threw me headlong over a stone wall. Yet blessed be the Lord, his power pre∣served me. He that did this violence to me, was John Knipe, a wicked man, whom afterwards the Lord cut off. There was a youth in the chapel, writing after the priest. I was moved to speak to him, and he came to be convinced, and received a part of the ministry of the gospel: his name was John Brathwait.</P>
<P>Then I went to an alehouse, to which many resorted betwixt the time of their morning and afternoon preaching; and had a great deal of reasoning with the people, declaring to them, That God was come to teach his people himself, and to bring them off from all false teachers, such as the prophets. Christ, and the apostles cried against. Many re∣ceived the word of life at that time, and abode in it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went about two or three miles to a steeple-house or chapel called Lyndal, When the priest
<PB N="94" REF="037441_0171_100D8EBF4D5F8DB0"/>had done, I spoke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me, and there were great opposers; but after∣wards they came to be convinced. After this I went to captain Sands, who with his wife seemed somewhat affected with truth, and if they could have held the world and truth together, they would have received it; but they were hypo∣crites, and he a very chaffy light man. Wherefore I re∣proved him for his lightness and jesting; telling him, It was not seemly in a great professor as he was. Thereupon he told me. He had a son, who upon his death-bed had also reproved him for it, and warned him of it. But he neither regarded the admonition of his dying son, nor the reproofs of God's Spirit in himself.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Ulverstone, and to Swarthmore to judge Fell's; whither came one Lampitt, a priest, who was an high notionist. With him I had a great deal of reasoning; for he would talk of high notions and perfection, and thereby deceived the people. He would have owned me but I could not own or join with him, he was so full of firth. He said. He was above John; and made as though he knew all things. But I told him, <Q>Death reign∣ed from Adam to Moses; and that he was under death, and knew not Moses: for Moses saw the paradise of God; but he knew neither Moses, nor the prophets, nor John.</Q> For that crooked and rough nature stood in him, and the mountain of sin and corruption; and the way was not prepared in him for the Lord. He confessed he had been under a cross in things; but now he could sing psalms, and do any thing. I told him, <Q>Now he could see a thief, and join hand in hand with him: but he could not preach Moses, nor the prophets, nor John, nor Christ, except he were in the same Spirit that they were in.</Q> Margaret Fell had been abroad in the day-time; and at night her children told her, priest Lampitt and I had disagreed; which somewhat troubled her, because she was in profession with him; but he hid his dirty actions from them. At night we had great reasoning; and I declared the truth to her and her family. Next day Lampitt came again, and I had a great deal of discourse with him before Margaret Fell, who then clearly discerned the priest. A convincement of the Lord's truth came upon her and her family. Soon after a day was to be observed for an humi∣liation; and Margaret Fell asked me to go with her to the steeple-house at Ulverstone, for she was not wholly come
<PB N="95" REF="037441_0172_100D8EC121CDC348"/>off from them: I replied, <Q>I must do as I am ordered by the Lord.</Q> So I left her, and walked into the fields; and the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <Q>Go to the steeple-house after them.</Q> When I came, Lampitt was singing with his people; but his spirit was so foul, and the matter they sung so unsuitable to their states, that after they had done singing, I was moved of the Lord to speak to him and the people. The word of the Lord to them was, <Q>He is not a Jew that is one outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, whose praise is not of man, but of God.</Q> Then, as the Lord opened further, I shewed them, <Q>That He was come to teach his people by his Spirit, and to bring them off from all their old ways, religions, churches, and worships; for all their religions, worships, and ways were but talking of other men's words; but they were out of the life and Spirit which those were in who gave them forth.</Q> Then cried out one justice Sawrey. <Q>Take him away;</Q> but judge Fell's wife said to the officers, <Q>Let him alone; why may he not speak, as well as any other?</Q> Lampitt also, the priest, in deceit, said, "Let him speak." So at length, when I had declared a pretty while, justice Sawrey caused the constable to put me out; and then I spoke to the people in the grave-yard.</P>
<P>The first-day after, I was moved to go to Aldenham steeple-house, and when the priest had done, I spoke to him; but he got away. Then I declared the word of life to the people, and warned them to turn to the Lord.</P>
<P>From thence I passed to Ramside, where was a chapel, in which Thomas. Lawson used to preach, who was an eminent priest. He very lovingly acquainted his people in the morning of my coming in the afternoon; by which means many were gathered together. When I came, I saw there was no place so convenient as the chapel: where∣fore I went into the chapel, and all was quiet. Thomas Lawson went not up into his pulpit, but left all the time to me. The everlasting day of the eternal God was pro∣claimed that day, and the everlasting truth was largely declared; which reached and entered into the hearts of the people, and many received the truth in the love of it. This priest came to be convinced, left his chapel, threw off his preaching for hire, and came to preach the Lord Jesus and his kingdom freely. After that some rude peo∣ple cast scandals upon him, and thought to have done him an injury; but he was carried over all, grew in the wis∣dom
<PB N="96" REF="037441_0173_100D8EC442F9BBE8"/>of God mightily, and proved very serviceable in his place.</P>
<P>I returned to Swarthmore again, and the next first-day went to Dalton steeple-house; where, after the priest had done, I declared the word of life to the people, that they might be turned from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God; and might come off from their superstitious ways, and from their teachers made by man, to Christ the true and living way, to be taught of him.</P>
<P>From thence I went into the island of Walnah; and after the priest had done. I spoke to him, but he got away. Then I declared the truth to the people, but they were something rude. I went to speak with the priest at his house, but he would not be seen. The people said, he went to hide himself in the hay-mow, and they looked for him there, but could not find him. Then they said, he was gone to hide himself in the standing corn, but they could not find him there neither. I went to James Lan∣caster's, who was convinced in the island, and from thence returned to Swarthmore, where the Lord's power seized upon Margaret Fell, her daughter Sarah, and several others.</P>
<P>Then I went to Becliss, where Leonard Fell was convin∣ced, and became a minister of the everlasting gospel. Se∣veral others were convinced there, and came into obedience to the truth. Here the people said, they could not dispute; and would fain have put some other to hold talk with me; but I bid them, <Q>Fear the Lord; and not in a light way hold a talk of the Lord's words, but put the things in practice.</Q> I directed them to the Divine Light <Q>of Christ and his Spirit in their hearts, which would let them see all the evil thoughts, words, and actions, that they had thought, spoken, and acted; by which light they might see their sin, and also their Saviour Christ Jesus to save them from their sins. This I told them was their first step to peace, even to stand still in the light that shewed them their sins and transgressions; by which they might come to see they were in the fall of old Adam, in darkness and death, strangers to the covenant of promise, and without God in the world: and by the same light they might see Christ that died for them to be their Re∣deemer and Saviour, and their way to God.</Q></P>
<P>After this I went to a chapel beyond Gleaston: which was built, but never a priest had preached in it. Thither
<PB N="97" REF="037441_0174_100D8EC64D9A5878"/>the country people came; and a quiet, peaceable meeting it was, in which the word of life was declared, and many were convinced of the truth about Gleaston.</P>
<P>From thence I returned to Swarthmore again. After I had staid a few days, and most of the family were convin∣ced, I went into Westmoreland, where priest Lampitt had been amongst the professors on Kendal side, and had mightily incensed them against me; telling them I held many strange things. I met with those that he had so in∣censed, sate up all night with them at James Dickinson's, and answered all their objections. They were both tho∣roughly satisfied with the truth I had declared, and dissatisfied with him and his lies, so that he clearly lost the best of his hearers and followers, who hereby came to see his de∣ceit, and forsook him.</P>
<P>I passed to John Audland's and Gervase Benson's, and had great meetings amongst those that had been convinced before. I passed to John Blakelin's and Richard Robin∣son's, where I had mighty meetings, and then towards Grisedale.</P>
<P>Soon after, judge Fell being come home, Margaret his wise sent to me, desiring me to return thither; and I, feeling freedom from the Lord so to do, went back to Swarthmore. I found the priests and professors, and justice Sawrey, had much incensed judge Fell and captain Sands against the truth by their lies; but when I came to speak with him, I answered all his objections, and so thorough∣ly satisfied him by the scriptures, that he was convinced in his judgment. He asked me, <Q>If I was that George Fox whom justice Robinson spoke so much in commendation of amongst many of the parliament men?</Q> I told him, I had been with justice Robinson, and justice Hotham, in Yorkshire, who were very civil and loving to me; and that they were convinced in their judgment by the Spirit of God, that the principle which I bore testimony to was the truth, and they saw beyond the priests of the nation; so that they and many others were now come to be wiser than their teachers. After we had discoursed a pretty while together, judge Fell himself was satisfied also, and came to see, by the openings of the Spirit of God in his heart, over all the priests and teachers of the world; and did not go to hear them for some years before he died; for he knew it was the truth that I declared, and that Christ was the teacher of his people, and their Saviour. He sometimes
<PB N="98" REF="037441_0175_100D8EC7DEBC0AC0"/>wished that I was awhile with judge Bradshaw to discourse with him. There came to judge Fell's captain Sands be∣fore-mentioned, endeavouring to incense the judge against me; for he was an evil-minded man, and full of envy against me; yet he could speak high things, use the scrip∣ture-words, and say, "Behold, I make all things new." But I told him, Then he must have a new God; for his God was his belly. Besides him came also that envious justice John Sawrey. I told him, <Q>His heart was rotten, and he was full of hypocrisy to the brim.</Q> Several others also carne, whose states the Lord gave me a discern∣ing of; and I spoke to their conditions. While I was in those parts, Richard Farnsworth and James Nayler came to see me and the family; and judge Fell, being satisfied that it was the way of truth, notwithstanding all their op∣position, suffered the meeting to be kept at his house; and a great meeting was settled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued near forty years, until the year 1690, that a new meeting-house was erected near it.</P>
<P>After I had staid awhile, and the meeting there was well settled, I departed to Under-barrow, where I had a great meeting. From thence I went to Kellet, and had a great meeting at Robert Withers's, to which several came from Lancaster, and some from York; and many were convin∣ced. On the market-day I went to Lancaster, and spoke through the market in the dreadful power of God; declar∣ing the day of the Lord to the people, and crying out against all their deceitful merchandize. I preached right∣eousness and truth unto them, which all should follow after, walk and live in; directing them how and where they might find and receive the Spirit of God to guide them thereinto. After I had cleared myself in the market, I went to my lodging, whither several people came; and many were convinced, who stood faithful to the truth.</P>
<P>The first-day following, in the forenoon, I had a great meeting in the street at Lancaster, amongst the soldiers and people, to whom I declared the word of life, and the ever∣lasting truth. I opened unto them, That all the traditions they had lived in, all their worships and religions, and the profession they made of the scriptures, were good for no∣thing, while they lived out of the life and power which those were in who gave forth the scriptures. I directed them to the light of Christ, the heavenly man, and to the Spirit of God in their own hearts, that they might come to
<PB N="99" REF="037441_0176_100D8EC982ACA1A0"/>be acquainted with God and Christ, receive him for their teacher, and kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his kingdom set up in them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went to the steeple-house at Lancaster, and declared the truth to the priest and people; laying open before them the deceit they lived in, and directing them to the power and Spirit of God which they wanted. But they haled me out, and stoned me along the street till I came to John Lawson's house.</P>
<P>Another first-day I went to a steeple-house by the water∣side, where one Whitehead was priest; to whom and to the people I declared the truth in the dreadful power of God. There came a doctor, so full of envy, that he said, <Q>He could find in his heart to run me through with his ra∣pier, though he was hanged for it the next day;</Q> yet this man came afterwards to be convinced of the truth, so far as to be loving to friends. Some were convinced there∣abouts, who willingly sate down under the ministry of Christ, their teacher; and a meeting was settled there in the power of God, which has continued to this day.</P>
<P>After this I returned into Westmoreland, and spoke through Kendal on a market-day. So dreadful was the power of God upon me, that people flew like chaff be∣fore me into their houses. I warned them of the mighty day of the Lord, and exhorted them to hearken to the voice of God in their own hearts, who was now come to teach his people himself. When some opposed, many others took my part. At last some fell to fighting about me; but I went and spoke to them, and they parted again. Several were convinced.</P>
<P>The first-day after I had a very large meeting in Under∣barrow at Miles Bateman's, where I was moved to declare, <Q>That all people in the fall were gone from the image of God, righteousness, and holiness, and were become as wells without the water of life, as clouds without the hea∣venly rain, as trees without the heavenly fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>; and were degenerated into the nature of beasts, of se pents, of tall cedars, of oaks, of bulls, and of heifers: so that they might read the natures of these creatures within, as the prophets described them to the people of old, that were out of truth. I opened to them, how some were in the nature of dogs and swine, biting and reading; some in the nature of briers, thistles, and thorns; some like the owls and dragons in the night; some like the wild asses and horses, snuffing up the wind; and some like the
<PB N="100" REF="037441_0177_100D8ECD21A88FD8"/>mountains and rocks, and crooked and rough ways. Wherefore I exhorted them to read these things within in their own natures, as well as without: and that, when they read without of the wandering stars, they should look within, and see how they have wandered from the bright and morning star. And they should consider, that as the fallow ground in their fields must be plowed up before it would bear seed to them, so must the fallow ground of their hearts be plowed up before they could bear seed to God. All these names and things I shewed were spoken of and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an and woman, since they fell from the image of God; but as they come to be renewed again into the image of God, they come out of the natures of these things, and so out of the names thereof.</Q> Many more such things were declared to them, and they were turned to the light of Christ, by which they might come to know and receive him, and might witness him to be their sub∣stance, their way, their salvation and true teacher. Many were convinced at that time.</P>
<P>After I had travelled up and down in those countries, having great meetings. I came to Swarthmore again; and when I had visited friends awhile in those parts, I heard of a great meeting the priests were to have at Ulverstone on a lecture-day. I went to it, and into the steeple-house in the dread and power of the Lord. When the priest had done, I spoke among them the word of the Lord, which was as an hammer, and as a fire amongst them. And though Lampitt, the priest of the place, had been at variance with most of the priests before, yet against the truth they all joined together. But the mighty power of the Lord was over all; and so wonderful was the appearance thereof, that priest Bennet said, "The church shook;" insomuch that he was afraid and trembled. And after he had spoken a few confused words, he hastened out for fear the steeple∣house would fall on his head. There were many priests got together, but they had no power as yet to persecute.</P>
<P>When I had cleared my conscience amongst them, I went to Swarthmore again. Thither came four or five of the priests. In discourse, I asked them, <Q>Whether any one of them could say, he ever had the word of the Lord to go and speak to such or such a people?</Q> None of them durst say he had; but one of them burst into a passion, and said, <Q>He could speak his experiences as well as I,</Q> I told him experience was one thing; but to receive
<PB N="101" REF="037441_0178_100D8ECF56C7A270"/>and go with a message, and to have a word from the Lord as the prophets and apostles had, and as I had had to them, was another thing. And therefore I put it to them again; <Q>Could any one of them say, he ever had a command or word from the Lord immediately at any time?</Q> But none of them could say so. Then I told them, The false prophets, false apostles, and antichrists, could use the words of the true prophets, true apostles, and of Christ, and would speak of other men's experiences, though themselves never knew nor heard the voice of God and Christ: and such as they might get the good words and experiences of others. This puzzled them much, and laid them open. For at another time, when I was discoursing with several priests at judge Fell's house, and he was by, I asked them the same question, <Q>Whether any of them ever heard the voice of God or Christ, to bid him to go to such or such a people, to declare his word or message unto them!</Q> for any one, I told them, that could but read, might declare the experiences of the prophets and apostles, which were recorded in the scriptures. Hereupon Thomas Taylor, an ancient priest, did ingenuously confess before judge Fell, <Q>That he had never heard the voice of God, nor of Christ, to send him to any people; but he spoke his experiences, and the experiences of the saints in former ages, and that he preached.</Q> This very much confirm∣ed judge Fell in the persuasion, <Q>That the priests were wrong;</Q> for he had thought formerly, as the generality of people then did, "That they were sent from God."</P>
<P>Thomas Taylor was convinced at this time, and travel∣led with me into Westmoreland. Coming to Crosland sleeple-house, we found the people gathered: and the Lord opened Thomas Taylor's mouth (though he was convinced but the day before) so that he declared amongst them, "How he had been before he was convinced," and, like the good scribe converted to the kingdom, he brought forth things new and old to the people, and shewed them, <Q>how the priests were out of the way:</Q> which fretted the priest. Some little discourse I had with them, but they fled away; and a precious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's pow∣er was over all, and the people were directed to the Spirit of God, by which they might come to know God and Christ, and to understland the Scriptures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. After this I passed on, visiting friends, and had very large meetings in Westmoreland.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="037441_0179_100D8F8FB7AB1170"/>
Now began the priests to rage more and more, and as much as they could to stir up persecution. James Nayler and Francis Howgill were cast into prison in Appleby gaol, at the instigation of the malicious priests; some of whom prophesied, <Q>That within a month we should be all scat∣tered again, and come to nothing.</Q> But blessed for ever be the worthy name of the Lord, his work went on and prospered; for about this time John Audland, Francis Howgill, John Camm, Edward Burrough, Richard Hub∣berthorn, Miles Hubbersty, and Miles Halhead, with se∣veral others, being endued with power from on high, came forth in the work of the ministry, and approved themselves faithful labourers therein; travelling up and down, and preaching the gospel freely; by means whereof multitudes were convinced, and many effectually turned to the Lord. Amongst these, Christopher Taylor was one, brother to Thomas Taylor before-mentioned, who had been preacher to a people as well as his brother; but after they had re∣ceived the knowledge of the truth, they soon came into obedience thereunto, and left their preaching for hire or re∣wards; and having received a part of the ministry of the gospel, they preached Christ freely, being often sent by the Lord to declare his word in steeple-houses and markets, and great sufferers they were.</P>
<P>After I had visited friends in Westmoreland, I returned into Lancashire, and went to Ulverstone, where Lampitt was priest; who though he had preached of a people that should own the teachings of God, and had said, <Q>That men and women should come and declare the gospel:</Q> yet when it came to be fulfilled, he persecuted both it and them. To this priest's house I went, where abundance of priests and professors were got together after their lecture, with whom I had great disputings concerning Christ and the scriptures; for they were loth to let their trade go down, which they made of preaching Christ's, the apostles, and prophets words. But the Lord's power went over the heads of them all, and his word of life was held forth amongst them; though many of them were exceeding envi∣ous and devilish. Yet after this, many priests and professors came to me from far and near. Those that were innocent and simple-minded were satisfied, and went away refreshed; but the fat and full were fed with judgment and sent away empty: for that was the word of the Lord to be divided to them.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="037441_0180_100D7F5696074C28"/>
When meetings were set up, and we met in private houses, Lampitt began to rage. He said, <Q>We forsook the temple, and went to Jeroboam's calves houses.</Q> So many professors began to see how he was declined from that which he had formerly held and preached. Hereupon the case of Jeroboam's calves was opened to the professors, priests, and people. It was manifested unto them, <Q>That their house (called churches) were more like Jeroboam's calves houses, even the old mass-houses, which were set up in the darkness of popery, which they who called themselves protestants, and professed to be more enlight∣ened than the papists, did still hold up, altho' God had never commanded them; whereas that temple, which God had commanded at Jerusalem, Christ came to end the service of; and those that received and believed in him, their bodies came to be the temples of God, of Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, to dwell in them, and to walk in them. And such were gathered into the name of Jesus, whose Name is above every name, and there is no salvation by any other name under the whole heaven but by the name of Jesus. And they that were thus gather∣ed met together in several dwelling-houses, which were not called the temple nor the church; but their bodies were the temples of God, and the believers were the church which Christ was the head of. So that Christ was not called the head of an old house, which was made by mens hands, neither did he come to purchase, sanctify, and redeem with his blood an old house, which they call∣ed their church; but the people, which he is the head of.</Q> Much work I had in those days with priests and people, concerning their old mass-houses called churches; for the priests had persuaded the people, that they were the houses of God; whereas the apostle says, <Q>Whose house we are,</Q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 6. The people in whom he dwells are God's house. The apostle saith, <Q>Christ pur∣chased his church with his own blood;</Q> and Christ calls his church his spouse, his bride, the lamb's wife: so that this title church and spouse was not given to an old house, but to his people the true believers.</P>
<P>On a lecture-day I was moved to go to the steeple-house at Ulverstone, where were abundance of professors, priests, and people. I went near to priest Lampitt, who was blus∣tering on in his preaching. After the Lord had opened my mouth to speak, John Sawrey the justice came to
<PB N="104" REF="037441_0181_100D7F59508A63E8"/>me, and said, <Q>If I would speak according to the scrip∣tures, I should speak,</Q> I admired at him for speaking so to me, and told him, <Q>I would speak according to the scriptures, and bring the scriptures to prove what I had to say; for I had something to speak to Lampitt and to them</Q> Then he said. I should not speak; contradict∣ing himself, who had said just before, <Q>I should speak, if I would speak according to the scriptures.</Q> The peo∣ple were quiet, and heard me gladly, till this justice Saw∣rey (who was the first stirrer up of cruel persecution in the north) incensed them against me, and set them on to hale, beat, and bruise me. But now on a sudden the people were in a rage, and fell upon me in the steeple-house before his face, knock'd me down, kick'd me, and trampled upon me. So great was the uproar, that some tumbled over their seats for fear. At last he came and took me from the people, led me out of the steeple-house, and put me into the hands of the constables and other officers; bidding them whip me, and put me out of the town. They led me about a quarter of a mile, some taking hold by my col∣lar, some by my arms and shoulders, who shook and drag∣ged me along. Many friendly people being come to the market, and some to the steeple-house to hear me, divers of these they knock'd down also, and broke their heads, so that the blood ran down from several; and judge Fell's son running after to see what they would do with me, they threw him into a ditch of water; some of them crying, "Knock the teeth out of his head." When they had haled me to the common moss side, a multitude following, the constables and other officers gave me some blows over my back with their willow rods, and thrust me among the rude multitude; who, having furnished themselves with staves, hedge-stakes, holm or holly bushes, fell upon me, and beat me on my head, arms, and shoulders, till they had deprived me of sense; so that I fell down upon the wet common. When I recovered again, and saw myself lying in a watery common, and the people standing about me, I lay still a little while, and the power of the Lord sprang through me, and the eternal refreshings revived me; so that I stood up again in the strengthening power of the eternal God, and stretching out my arms amongst them, I said, with a loud voice, "Strike again; here are my arms, my head, and my cheeks." There was in the company a mason, a pro∣fessor, but a rude fellow, who with his walking rule-staff
<PB N="105" REF="037441_0182_100D7F67E6CA86D8"/>gave me a blow with all his might just over the back of my hand, as it was stretched out; with which blow my hand was so bruised, and my arm so benumbed. that I could not draw it to me again; so that some of the people cried, <Q>He hath spoiled his hand for ever having the use of it any more.</Q> But I looked at it in the love of God (for I was in the love of God to all that persecuted me) and after awhile the Lord's power sprang through me again, and through my hand and arm, so that in a moment I recovered strength in my hand and arm in the sight of them all. Then they began to fall out among themselves: some of them came to me, and said, If I would give them money, they would secure me from the rest. But I was moved of the Lord to declare the word of life, and shewed them their false christianity, and the fruits of their priest's mi∣nistry; telling them, They were more like heathens and Jews, than true christians. Then was I moved of the Lord to come up again through the midst of the people, and go into Ulverstone market. As I went, there met me a sol∣dier, with his sword by his side; "Sir," said he to me," I <Q>see you are a man, and I am ashamed and grieved that you should be thus abused;</Q> and offered to assist me in what he could. I told him, The Lord's power was over all, and I walked through the people in the market, none of whom had power to touch me then. But some of the market people abusing some friends in the market, I turned about, and saw this soldier among them with his naked rapier; whereupon I ran, and, catching hold of the hand his rapier was in, bid him put up his sword again, if he would go along with me: for I was willing to draw him out from the company lest some mischief should be done. A few days after, seven men fell upon this soldier, and beat him cruelly, because he had taken part with friends and me. It was the manner of the persecutors of that country, for twenty or forty people to run upon one man. They fell so upon friends in many places, that they could hardly pass the highways, stoning, beating, and breaking their heads. When I came to Swarthmore, I found the friends there dressing the heads and hands of friends and friendly people, which had been broken or hurt that day by the professors and hearers of Lampitt. My body and arms were yellow, black and blue, with the bruises I received amongst them. Now began the priests
<PB N="106" REF="037441_0183_100D8ED0EC166080"/>to prophesy again, That within half a year we should be all put down and gone.</P>
<P>About two weeks after this, I went into Walney island, and James Nayler with me. We staid one night at a little town on this side, called Cockan, and had a meeting there, where one was convinced. After awhile came a man with a pistol; whereupon the people ran out of doors. He cal∣led for me; and when I came to him, he snapped his pis∣tol at me; but it would not go off. This caused the peo∣ple to make a great bustle about him; and some of them took hold of him, to prevent his doing mischief. But I was moved in the Lord's power to speak to him; and he was so struck by divine power that he trembled for fear, and went and hid himself. Thus the Lord's power came over them all, though there was a great rage in the country.</P>
<P>Next morning I went in a boat to James Lancasler's. As soon as I came to land, there rushed out about forty men, with staves, clubs, and fishing-poles; who fell upon me, beating, punching me, and endeavouring to thrust me backward into the sea. When they had thrust me almost into the sea, and I saw they would have knocked me down in it, I went up into the middle of them; but they laid at me again, knocked me down, and stunned me. When I came to myself, I looked up and saw James Lancaster's wife throwing stones at my face, and her husband lying over me, to keep the blows and stones from me. For the people had persuaded James's wife that I had bewitched her husband; and had promised her, That if she would let them know when I came thither, they would be my death; and having got knowledge of my coming, many of the town rose up in this manner with clubs and staves to kill me; but the Lord's power preserved me, that they could not take away my life. At length I got upon my feet, but they beat me down again into the boat; which James Lan∣caster observing, he presently came into the boat to me, and set me over the water from them; but while we were on the water, within their reach, they struck at us with long poles, and threw stones after us. By that time we were come to the other side, we saw them beating James Nayler: for whilst they had been beating me, he walked into a field, and they never minded him till I was gone; then they fell upon him, and all their cry was <Q>Kill him, kill him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="037441_0184_100D8ED2D2AC74E0"/>
When I was come over to the town again, on the other side of the water, the townsmen rose up with pitchforks, flails, and staves, to keep me out of the town, crying, <Q>Kill him, knock him on the head; bring the cart, and carry him away to the church-yard.</Q> So after they had abused me, they drove me a pretty way out of the town, and there left me. Then went James Lancaster again, to look after James Nayler; and I being now left alone, went to a ditch; and having washed myself, walked about three miles to Thomas Hutton's, where lodged Thomas Lawson, the priest that was convinced. When I came in, I could hardly speak to them, I was so bruised; only I told them where I left James Nayler. Whereupon they took each of them a horse, and went and brought him thither that night. The next day Margaret Fell hearing of it, sent an horse for me; but so sore I was with bruises, that I was not able to bear the shaking of the horse without much pain. When I was come to Swarthmore, justice Sawrey and justice Thompson of Lancaster granted a warrant against me; but judge Fell coming home, it was not served upon me: for he was out of the country all this time that I was thus cruelly abused. When he came home, he sent warrants into the isle of Walney, to apprehend all those riotous persons; whereupon some of them sled the country. James Lancaster's wife was afterwards convinced of the truth, and repented of the evil she had done me; and so did some others of those bitter persecutors also; but the judgments of God fell upon some, and destruction is come upon many of them since. Judge Fell desired me to give him a relation of my persecution; but I told him, They could do no otherwise in the spirit wherein they were; and that they manifested the fruits of their priest's ministry, and their pro∣fession and religion to be wrong. So he told his wife I made nothing of it; and that I spake of it as a man that had not been concerned: for indeed the Lord's power heal∣ed me again.</P>
<P>After I was recovered, I went to Yell and, where was a great meeting. In the evening came a priest to the house, with a pistol in his hand, under pretence to light a pipe of tobacco. The maid of the house seeing the pistol, told her master: who thereupon, clapping his hands on both the door-posts, told him, He should not come in there. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e he stood there, keeping the door way, he looked up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d spied over the wall a company of men coming, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed
<PB N="108" REF="037441_0185_100D8ED60C8EF740"/>with staves, and one with a musket. But the Lord pre∣vented their bloody design; so that seeing themselves dis∣covered, they went their way, and did no harm.</P>
<P>The time for the sessions at Lancaster being come, I went thither with judge Fell; who on the way told me, He never had such a matter brought before him, and could not well tell what to do in the business. I answered when Paul was brought before the rulers, and the Jews and priests came down to accuse him, and laid many false things to his charge, Paul stood still all that while. When they had done, Festus the governor and king Agrippa beckoned to him to speak for himself; which Paul did, and cleared him∣self of all those accusations: so he might do by me. Being come to Lancaster, and justice Sawrey and justice Thomp∣son having granted a warrant to apprehend me, though I was not apprehended by it, yet hearing of it, I appeared at the sessions; where there appeared against me about forty priests. These had chosen one Marshal, a priest of Lan∣caster, to be their orator; and had provided one young priest and two priests sons to bear witness against me, who had sworn beforehand that I had spoken blasphemy. When the justices were set, they heard all that the priests and their witnesses could say and charge against me; their orator Marshal sitting by, and explaining their sayings for them; but the witnesses were so confounded, that they dis∣covered themselves to be false witnesses. For when the court had examined one of them upon oath, and then be∣gan to examine another of them, he was at such a loss, he could not answer directly; but said. The other could say it. Which made the justices say to him, <Q>Have you sworn it, and given it in already upon oath, and now say, that he can say it? It seems, you did not hear those words spo∣ken yourself, though you have sworn it?</Q></P>
<P>There were then in court several who had been at that meeting, wherein the witnesses swore I spoke those blasphe∣mous words which the priests accused me of; and these, being men of integrity and reputation in the country, did declare and affirm in court, That the oath, which the witnesses had taken against me, was altogether false; and that no such words as they had sworn against me were spoken by me at that meeting. Indeed, most of the serious men of that side of the country, then at the sessions, had been at that meet∣ing and had heard me both at that and other meetings also. This was taken notice of by colonel West, who being a
<PB N="109" REF="037441_0186_100D8ED823216498"/>justice of the peace, was then upon the bench; and having long been weak in body, blessed the Lord, and said, The Lord had healed him that day; adding, That he never saw so many sober people and good faces together in all his life. Then turning himself to me, he said in the open sessions, <Q>George, if thou hast any thing to say to the people, thou mayest freely declare it.</Q> I was moved of the Lord to speak: and as soon as I began, priest Marshal, the orator for the rest of the priests, went his way. That which I was moved to declare, was this: <Q>That the holy scriptures were given forth by the Spirit of God; and all people must first come to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might know God and Christ, of whom the prophets and apostles learnt; and by the same Spirit know the holy scriptures; for as the Spirit of God was in them that gave forth the scriptures, so the same Spirit must be in all them that come to understand the scriptures. By which Spirit they might have fellowship with the Father, with the Son, with the scriptures, and with one another: and without this Spirit they can know neither God, Christ, nor the scriptures, nor have a right fellowship one with another.</Q> I had no sooner spoken these words, but about half a dozen priests, that stood behind me, burst into a passion. One of them, whose name was Jackus, amongst other things that he spake against the truth, said, That the Spirit and the letter were inseparable. I replied, <Q>Then every one that hath the letter, hath the Spirit; and they might buy the Spirit with the letter of the scriptures.</Q> This plain discovery of darkness in the priest moved judge Fell and colonel West to reprove them openly, and tell them. That according to that position, they might carry the Spirit in their pockets as they did the scriptures. Upon this, the priests, being confounded and put to silence, rush∣ed out in a rage against the justices, because they could not have their bloody ends upon me. The justices, seeing the witnesses did not agree, and perceiving they were brought to answer the priests envy, and finding that all their evi∣dences were not sufficient in law to make good their charge against me, discharged me. And after judge Fell had spo∣ken to justice Sawrey and justice Thompson concerning the warrant they had given forth against me, and shewing them the errors thereof, he and colonel West granted a super∣sedeas to stop the execution of it. Thus I was cleared in open sessions of those lying accusations which the malicious
<PB N="110" REF="037441_0187_100D8ED9B3FCDA68"/>priests had laid to my charge: and multitudes of people praised God that day, for it was a joyful day to many. Justice Benson of Westmoreland was convinced; and major Ripan, mayor of the town of Lancaster, also. It was a day of everlasting salvation to hundreds of people: for the Lord Jesus Christ, the way to the Father, the free Teacher, was exalted and set up; his everlasting gospel was preach∣ed, and the word of eternal life was declared over the heads of the priests, and all such lucrative preachers. For the Lord opened many mouths that day to speak his word to the priests, and several friendly people and professors re∣proved them in their inns, and in the streets, so that they fell, like an old rotten house: and the cry was among the people, That the Quakers had got the day, and the priests were fallen. Many were convinced that day, amongst whom Thomas Briggs was one, who before had been so averse to friends and truth, that discoursing with John Lawson, a friend, concerning perfection, Thomas said to him, "Dost thou hold perfection?" and lift up his hand, to have given the friend a box on the ear. But Thomas, being convinced of the truth that day, declared against his own priest Jackus; and afterwards became a faithful mi∣nister of the gospel, and stood so to the end of his days.</P>
<P>When the sessions were over, James Nayler, who was present, gave a brief account of the proceedings thereof in a letter, which soon after he wrote to friends, and is here added for the reader's further satisfaction:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ, my dear love unto you all, desiring you may be kept steadfast in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the power of his love, boldly to witness forth the truth, as it is re∣vealed in you by the mighty working of the Father: to him alone be everlasting praise and honour for evermore! Dear friends, the Lord doth much manifest his love and power in these parts. The second day of the last week my brother George and I were at Lancaster. There were abundance of friends from all parts; and a great many who sided with the priests, giving out, They now hoped to see a stop put to that great work which had gone on so fast, and with such power, that their kingdom is much shaken. We were called before judge Fell, colonel West, justice Sawrey, &amp;c. to answer what was charged against George. There were three witnesses to eight particu∣lars,
<PB N="111" REF="037441_0188_100D8EDB4E6201C0"/>but they were much confused in themselves; which gave much light to the truth: whereby the justices did plainly see that it was envy; and they divers times told them so. One of the witnesses was a young priest, who confessed, He had not meddled, had not another priest sent for him, and set him on work. The other witnesses were two priests sons. It was proved there by many, that heard one of them say, If he had power, he would make George deny his profession, and that he would take away his life. This was a single witness to one of the greatest untruths charged against George. The justices told him, They saw, because he could not take away his life, he went about to take away his liberty. There was one priest chosen out of the whole number, as an orator, to plead against us; who spared no pains to shew his envy against the truth: and when he could not prevail, he went down in a rage; and there came a number of them into the room, among whom was one Jackus. George was then speaking in the room (one of the judges having wished, if he had any thing to say, that he would speak:) at which priest Jackus was in such a rage, that he brake forth into many high expressions against the truth spoken by my dear brother George; amongst which this was one, That the letter and the Spirit were inseparable. Hereupon the justices stood up, and bid him prove that, before he went any further. Then he seeing himself caught, would have denied it; and when he could not get off so, the rest of the priests would have helped him to a meaning for his words: but the justices would admit no othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ning than the plain sense of the words, and told him, He had laid down a position, and it was fit he should prove it; pressing the matter close upon him. Whereupon the priests, be∣ing put to silence, went down in a greater rage than before; and some of them, after they were gone down, being asked what they had done, lied, and said, They could not get into the room; thereby to hide their shame, and keep the people in blindness. The justices, judge Fell, and colonel West, were much convinced of the truth, and did set up justice and equity; and have much silenced the rage of the people. Many bitter spirits were at Lancaster, to see the event; but went home, and cried, The priests had lost the day. Everlasting pralses be to him who fought the battle for us, who is our King
<PB N="112" REF="037441_0189_100D8EDE9A61C8C0"/>for ever! There were others called, who the witnesses confessed were in the room when the things charged on George were said to have been spoken; but they all, as one man, denied that any such words were spoken: which gave much light to the justices, and they durst rely on what they witnessed; for they said, they knew many of them to be honest men. There was a warrant granted against us at Appleby; but justice Benson told them it was not according to law; and so it ceased. I hear he is a faithful man to the truth. The priests began to preach against the justices, and said, They were not to meddle in these things, but to end controversy betwixt neighbour and neighbour. They are not pleased with the law, be∣cause it is not in the statute to imprison us, as the priest that pleaded against us said. The justices bid him go put it into the statute, if he could; he said, It should want no will of his. They are much afraid that they shall lose all. They are much discontented in these parts; and some of them cry, "All is gone." Dear friends, dwell in patience, and wait upon the Lord, who will do his own work. Look not at man, in the work; nor at man, who opposeth the work: but rest in the will of the Lord, that so ye may be furnished with patience both to do and to suffer what ye shall be called unto; that your end in all things may be his praise. Take up his cross freely, which keeps low the fleshly man; that Christ may be set up and honoured in all things, the light advanced in you, and the judgment set up, which must give sentence against all that opposeth the truth; that the captivity may be led captive, and the prisoner set free to seek the Lord; that righteousness may rule in you, and peace and joy may dwell in you, wherein consisteth the kingdom of the Fa∣ther; to whom be all praise for ever! Dear friends, meet often together; take heed of what exalteth itself above its brother; keep low, and serve one another in love for the Lord's sake. Let all friends know how it is with us, that God may have the praise of all.</P>

<P>At this time I was in a fast, and was not to eat until this work of God, which then lay weighty upon me, was ac∣complished. But the Lord's power was wonderfully exalt∣ed, and he gave truth and friends dominion therein over
<PB N="113" REF="037441_0190_100D8EE1868C3D30"/>all. His glory was freely preached that day, over the heads of about forty hireling priests. I staid two or three days afterwards in Lancaster, and had some meetings there. The rude and baser sort of people plotted together to have drawn me out of the house, and to have thrown me over Lancaster bridge, but the Lord prevented them. Then they invented another mischief, which was this: After a meeting at Lancaster, they brought down a distracted man, and another with him, having bundles of birchen rods, bound together like besoms, with which they should have whipped me; but I was moved to speak to them in the Lord's mighty power, which chained down the distracted man, and the other also; and made them cahn and quiet. Then I bid him throw his rods into the fire, and burn them; which he did. Thus the Lord's power being over then, they departed quietly.</P>
<P>The priests, fretting to see themselves overthrown at the sessions at Lancaster, got some of the envious justices to join with them; and at the following assize at Lancaster informed judge Windham against me. Whereupon the judge made a speech against me in open court; and com∣manded colonel West, who was clerk of the assize, to issue a warrant for the apprehending of me; but colonel West told the judge of my innocence, and spoke boldly in my defence. Yet the judge commanded him again, either to write a warrant, or go from his seat. Then he told the judge plainly, that he would not do it; but that he would offer up all his estate, and his body also for me. Thus he stopped the judge, and the Lord's power came over all; so that the priests and justices could not get their envy exe∣cuted. The same night I came into Lancaster, it being the assize-time: and hearing of a warrant to be given out against me, I judged it better to shew myself openly, than for my adversaries to seek me. So I went to judge Fell's and colonel West's chambers. As soon as I came in, they smiled on me; and colonel West said, <Q>What! are you come into the dragon's mouth?</Q> I staid till the judge went out of town; and I walked up and down the town, but no one meddled with me, nor questioned me. Thus the Lord's blessed power, which is over all, carried me through and over this exercise, gave dominion over his ene∣mies, and enabled me to go on in his glorious work and service for his great name's sake. For though the beast
<PB N="114" REF="037441_0191_100D8EE318EFD9A0"/>maketh war against the saints, yet the Lamb hath got and will get the victory.</P>
<P>From Lancaster I returned to Robert Withers's. From thence I went to Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mas Leper's, and a very blessed meet∣ing we had there; after which, I walked in the evening to Robert Withers's again. No sooner was I gone, but there came a company of disguised men to Thomas Leper's, with swords and pistols; who suddenly entering the house, put out the candles, and swung their swords about amongst the people of the house, so that they were fain to hold up the chairs before them, to save themselves from being cut and wounded. At length they drove all the people out, and then searched the house for me, who it seems was the only person they looked for. They had laid wait before in the highway, by which I should have gone if I had rid to Robert Withers's, and not meeting with me on the way, they thought to have found me in the house, but the Lord prevented them. Soon after I came to Robert Withers's, some friends from the town where Thomas Leper lived gave us a relation of this wicked attempt; and were afraid lest they should come and search Robert Withers's house also for me, and do me a mischief; but the Lord restrained them, that they came not. These men were in disguise, yet friends perceived some of them were Frenchmen, and supposed them to be servants belonging to one called Sir Robert Bindlas: for some of them had said, in their na∣tion they used to tie the protestants to trees, and whip and destroy them. His servants often abused friends, both in, and going to and from their meetings. They once took Richard Hubberthorn and serveral others out of the meet∣ing, carried them a long way into the fields, bound them, and left them in the winter season. Another time one of his servants came to Francis Fleming's, and thrust his naked rapier in at the door and windows; but a kins∣man of Francis Fleming's, not a friend, came with a cudgel, and bid the servant man put up his rapier; which when he would not, but vapoured at him with it, and was rude, he knocked him down, took his rapier from him, and, had it not been for friends, would have run him through with it. So friends preserved his life, that would have destroyed theirs.</P>
<P>From Robert Withers's I went to visit justice West, Richard Hubberthorn accompanying me. Not knowing the way, nor the danger of the sands, we rode where, we
<PB N="115" REF="037441_0192_100D8EE5951B2ED8"/>were afterwards told, no man ever rode before, swimming our horses over a very dangerous place. When we were come in, justice West asked us, If we did not see two men riding over the sands? "I shall have their cloaths anon," said he, <Q>for they cannot escape drowning; and I am the coroner.</Q> But when we told him we were the men, he was astonished, and wondered how we escaped drowning. Upon this the envious priests and professors raised a stan∣derous report, That neither water could drown me, nor could they draw blood of me; and therefore I was a witch: indeed, somtimes when they beat me with great staves, they did not much draw my blood, though they bruised my body very sorely. But all these slanders were nothing to me with respect to myself; though I was concerned on the truth's behalf, which I saw they endeavoared by these means to prejudice people against; for I considered that their forefathers, the apostate Jews, called the master of the house Beelzebub; and these apostate christians from the life and power of God could do no less to his seed. But the Lord's power carried me over their slanderous tongues, and their bloody murderous spirits; who had the ground of witchcraft in themselves, which kept them from coming to God and to Christ.</P>
<P>Having visited justice West, I went to Swarthmore, vi∣siting friends, and the Lord's power was over all the per∣secutors there. I was moved to write letters to the magis∣trates, priests, and professors thereabouts, who had raised persecution before. That to justice Sawrey was after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOU wast the first beginner of all the persecution in the north. Thou wast the beginner and maker of the people tumultuous. Thou wast the first stirrer of them up against the righteous seed, and against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he truth of God; the first strengthener of the hands of evil-doers against the innocent and harmless: and thou shalt not prosper. Thou wast the first stirrer up of strikers, stoners, persecutors, stockers, mockers, and imprisoners in the north, and of revilers, slanderers, railers, and false accu∣sers. This was thy work; this thou stirredst up. So thy fruits declare thy spirit. Inslead of stirring up the pure mind in people, thou hast stirred up the wicked, ma∣licious, and envirous; and taken hand with the wicked.
<PB N="116" REF="037441_0193_100D8EE869482550"/>Thou hast made the people's minds envious up and down the country: this was thy work. But God hath shorten∣ed thy days, limited and set thy bounds, broken thy jaws, discovered thy religion to the simple and babes, and brought thy deeds to light. How is thy habitation fallen, and become the habitation of devils! How is thy beauty lost, and thy glory withered! How hast thou shewed thy evil, that thou hast served God but with thy lips, and thy heart far from him, and thou in the hypocrisy! How hath the form of thy teaching discovered itself to be the mark of the false prophets, whose fruit declares itself! for by their fruits they are known. How are the wise men turned backward! View thy ways! take notice with whom thou hast taken part. That of God in thy conscience will tell thee. The Ancient of days will reprove thee. How hath thy zeal appeared to be the blind zeal of a persecu∣tor which Christ and his apostles forbad Christians to sol∣low! How hast thou strengthened the hands of evil-doers, and been a praise to them, and not to those that do well! How like a madman and a blind man didst thou turn thy sword backward against the saints, against whom there is no law! How wilt thou be gnawed and burned one day, when thou shalt feel the flame, and have the plagues of God poured upon thee, and thou begin to gnaw thy tongue for pain, because of the plagues! Thou shalt have thy reward according to thy works. Thou canst not escape; the Lord's righteous judgment will find thee out, and the witness of God in thy con∣science shall answer it. How hast thou caused the heathen to blaspheme, gone with the multitude to do evil, and joined hand in hand with the wicked! How is thy lat∣ter end worse than thy beginning, who art come with the dog to bite, and art turned as a wolf to devour the lambs! How hast thou discovered thyself to be a man more fit to be kept in a place to be nurtured, than to be set in a place to nurture! How wast thou exalted and puffed up with pride! And now art thou fallen down with shame, that thou comest to be covered with that which thou stir∣redst up and broughtest forth. Let not John Sawrey take the words of God into his mouth till he be reformed: let him not take his name into his mouth, till he depart from iniquity. Let not him and his teacher make a pro∣fession of the saints words, except they intend to proclaim themselves hypocrites, whose lives are so contrary to the
<PB N="117" REF="037441_0194_100D8EEA6245C208"/>lives of the saints; whose church hath made itself manifest to be a cage of unclean birds. You having a form of godliness, but not the power, have made them that are in the power your derision, your by-word, and your talk at your feasts. Thy ill savour, John Sawrey, the country about have smelled, and of thy unchristian carriage all that fear God have been ashamed; and to them thou hast been a grief: in the day of account thou shalt know it, even in the day of thy condemnation. Thou wast mount∣ed up and hadst set thy nest on high, but never got high∣er than the fowls of the air. Now thou art run among the beasts of prey, and art fallen into the earth; so that earthliness and covetousness have swallowed thee up. Thy conceitedness would not carry thee through, in whom was found the selfish principle which hath blinded thine eye. Thy back must be bowed down always; for thy table is already become thy snare.</P>

<P>THE word of the Lord to thee, O Lampitt! A de∣ceiver, surfeited and drunk with the earthly spirit, rambling up and down in the scriptures, and blending thy spirit amongst the saints conditions; who hadst a pro∣phecy, as thy father Balaam had, but art erred from it, as thy father did.

Thou art in the seat of the Pharisees, art called of men master, slandest pray∣ing in the synagogues, and hast the chief seat in the assemblies; a right hypocrite in the steps of the Phari∣sees, and in the way of thy fathers, the hypocrites, which our Lord Jesus Christ cried wo against.

<P>Having thus cleared my conscience to the justice and the priest of Ulverstone, it was upon me to send this warn∣ing in writing to the people of Ulverstone in general.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CONSIDER, O people! who are within the parish of Ulverstone, I was moved of the Lord to come into your publick places to speak among you, being sent of God to direct your minds to him, that you might know where to sind your teacher; that your minds might be stayed alone upon God, and you might not gad abroad without you for a teacher; for the Lord alone will teach his people; he is coming to teach them, and to gather his people from idols temples, and from the customary wor∣ships which all the world is trained up in. God hath given to every one of you a measure of his Spirit accord∣ing to your capacity; liars, drunkards, whoremongers, and thieves, and who follow filthy pleasures, you all have this measure in you. This is the measure of the Spirit of God that shews you sin, evil, and deceit; which le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s you see lying is sin; theft, drunkenness, and uncleanness, to be the works of darkness. Therefore mind your mea∣sure (for nothing that is unclean shall enter into the king∣dom of God) and prize your time while you have it, lest the time come that you will say, with sorrow, we had
<PB N="119" REF="037441_0196_100D8EED9857E348"/>time, but it is past. Oh! why will ye die! Why will ye choose your own ways! Why will ye follow the course of the world! Why will ye follow envy, malice, drunk∣enness, and foolish pleasures! Know ye not in your con∣sciences, that all these are evil and sin? and that such as act these things shall never enter into the kingdom of God? Oh! that ye would consider and see how you have spent your time, and mind how ye spend your time, and observe whom ye serve; for the wages of sin is death. Do not ye know, that whatsoever is more than yea and nay cometh of evil? Oh! ye drunkards, who live in drunkenness, do ye think to escape the fire, the judgment of God? Though ye swell in venom, and live in lust for awhile, yet God will find you out, and bring you to judgment. Therefore love the light which Christ hath enlightened you withal, who saith, I am the light of the world, and who enlightens every one that cometh into the world. One loves the light, and brings his works to the light, and there is no occasion at all of stumbling: the other hates the light, because his deeds are evil, and the light will reprove him. Thou that hatest this light thou hast it. Thou knowest, lying is evil, drunk∣enness is evil, swearing is evil, whoredom, thest, all un∣godliness, and unrighteousness, are evil. Christ Jesus hath given thee light enough to let thee see these are evil. This light, if thou lovest it, will teach thee holiness and righteousness, without which none shall see God; but if thou hatest this light, it is thy condemnation. Thus are Christ's words found to be true, and fulfilled among you. You that hate this light set up hirelings and idols temples, and such priests as bear rule by their means; such shepherds as hold up such things, such as are called of men masters and have the chiefest place in the assem∣blies, whom Christ cried wo against, Mat. xxiii. such as go in the way of Cain, in envy, and after the error of Balaam for wages, gifts, and rewards, these have been your teachers, and these you have held up. But those who love the light are taught of God, and the Lord is coming to teach his people himself, and to gather his from the hirelings, from such as seek for their gain from their quarter, and from such as bear rule by their means. The Lord is opening the eyes of people, that they shall see such as bear rule over them. But all, whose eyes are shut, are such as the prophet spoke of <Q>That have eyes, and
<PB N="120" REF="037441_0197_100D8EF0A28A6840"/>see not; but are foolish, upholding such things.</Q> There∣fore, poor people, as ye love your own souls, consider the love of God to your souls while ye have time, and do not turn the grace of God into wantonness. That which shews you ungodliness and worldly lusts should and would be your teacher, if you would hearken to it; for the saints of old witnessed the grace of God to be their teacher, which taught them to live soberly and godly in this present world. You that are not sober, this grace of God hath appeared unto you; but you turn it into want∣tonness, and set up teachers without you, who are not sober, not holy, not godly. Here you are left without excuse, when the righteous judgment of God shall be re∣vealed upon all who live ungodlily. Therefore to the light in you I speak; and when the book of conscience shall come to be opened, then shall you witness what I say to be true, and you all shall be judged out of it. God Almighty direct your minds (such of you especially as love honesty and sincerity) that you may receive mercy in the time of need. Your teacher is within you; look not forth: it will teach you both lying in bed, and going abroad, to shun all occasion of sin and evil.</P>

<P>As the foregoing was directed to all the inhabitants of Ulverstone in general, so it was upon me to write to those more particularly that most constantly followed W. Lam∣pitt. To these I wrote after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord God to all the people that follow priest Lampitt, who is a blind guide. Ye are such as are turned from the light of Christ within, which he hath enlightened you withal: ye are such as follow that which Christ cried wo against, that go not in Christ's way, but in the Pharisees way, as ye may read, Mat. xxiii. which our Lord cried wo against. He is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; but him ye own not while ye follow such as he cried wo against, though ye make a profession, and Lampitt, your priest, makes a trade of Christ's and the saints words, as his fathers, the Pharisees, made a profession of the prophets and of Mo∣ses's words. Wo was unto them who had not the life, so wo is unto you who have not the life that gave forth the scriptures, as your fruits have made manifest. For
<PB N="121" REF="037441_0198_100D8EF2C0AC2650"/>when the Lord moved some to come amongst you, to preach the truth freely, you knock'd them down, beat, punched, and haled them out of your assemblies. Such a people serves thee, O Lampitt, to make a prey upon, and these are thy fruits. Oh! let shame, shame strike thee and you all in the faces, who make a profession of Christ's words, yet are stoners, strikers, mockers, and scoffers. Let all see, if this be not a cage of unclean birds, which they who had the life of the scriptures spoke of. Such a company of people thou deceivest, feedest them with thy fancies, makest a trade of the scriptures, and takest them for thy cloak. But thou art manifest to all the children of light, for that cloak will not cover thee, thy skirts are seen and thy nakedness appears. The Lord made one to go naked among you, a figure of thy naked∣ness, and of your nakedness, and as a sign amongst you, before your destruction cometh; that you might see you were naked and not covered with the truth. To the light in all your consciences I speak, which Christ Jesus doth enlighten you withal. It will shew you the time you have spent, and all the evil you have done in that time, who follow such a teacher, that acts contrary to this light, and leads you into the ditch. When you are in the ditch together, both teacher and people, remember ye were warned in your life-time. If ever your eye come to see repentance, and you obey the light of Jesus Christ in you, you will witness me to have been a friend of your souls, and that I have sought your eternal good, and written this in dear love to you. Then will you own your con∣demnation; which you must all own before you can come into that blessed life, of which there is no end. But ye, who hate the light, because your deeds are evil, this light is your condemnation. Oh! that ye would love this light and hearken to it! It would teach you, as you walk up and down about your occasions, and as you lie upon your beds, and would never let you speak a vain word. In loving it, you love Christ; in hating it, you bring the condemnation thereof upon yourselves. To you this is the word of God, from under which you can never pass, not ever escape the terror of the Lord in the state you are in, who hate the light.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord to thee, priest Tatharn, who art found out of the doctrine of Christ; having the chiefest place in the assembly, being called of men master, and standing praying in the synagogue in the steps of the Pharisees, which our Lord Jesus Christ cried wo against. In his way thou art not, but in the way of the Scribes and Pharisees; as thou mayest read, Matth. xxiii. There Christ's words judge thee, and the scriptures of truth con∣demn thee. For thou art such a one as sues men at law for tithes, yet professest thyself to be a minister of Christ; which Christ never empowered his to do: neither did any of his apostles or ministers ever do so. Here I charge thee in the presence of the Living God as one out of their doctrine, and that thou art one of those evil beasts the scripture speaks of, that mindest earthly things which the life of the scriptures is against. Thou art for destruction
<PB N="123" REF="037441_0200_100D8EF5F67C6CE0"/>in the state wherein thou standest; and it will be thy por∣tion eternally, if thou dost not repent. To that of God in thy conscience I speak, which will witness the truth of what I say. Thou art one that goest in Cain's way, in envy, an enemy to God, and from the command of God. Thou art one that goest in Balaam's way, from the Spirit of God. for gifts and rewards, the wages of unrighteous∣ness. Thou son of Balaam, thou art worse than thy fa∣ther: for though he loved the wages of unrighteousness, yet he durst not take it; but thou not only takest it, but suest men at law if they will not give it thee: which no true minister of Jesus Christ ever did. Therefore stop thy mouth for ever, and make no mention of them, nor profess thyself one of them. With the light thou art seen and comprehended; who art light and vain, and speakest a divination of thy own brain, and deceivest the people. That in thy conscience will witness what I say, and will condemn thee, who art one of those that bear rule by their means, which the Lord sent Jeremiah to cry against, Jer. v. and so thou holdest up the <Q>horrible and filthy thing, that is committed in the land.</Q> They that do not tremble at the word of the Lord are the foolish peo∣ple that hold thee up, they are sottish children without understanding. They are wise to do evil, but not to do good, who are deceived by thee. Thou art one of those that seek their gain from their quarter; a greedy dumb dog that never hath enough, as thy practice makes manifest; such the Lord sent Isaiah to cry against, Isa. lvi. 11, 12. Thou art such a one as the Lord sent Ezekiel to cry against, who feedest of the fat, and clothest with the wool, and makest a prey of the people. But the Lord is ga∣thering his sheep from thy mouth, that to thee they shall be a prey no longer. Thou enemy of God, here this prophecy is fulfilled upon thee, Ezek. xxxiv. and thou art one of them. I charge it upon thee in the presence of the Living God. A hireling thou art, and those that put not into thy mouth, thou preparest war against. Thou hatest the good, and lovest the evil; which the Lord sent Micah to cry against, Mic. iii. Cover thy lips, and stop thy mouth for ever, thou child of darkness; for with the light thou art comprehended, and seen to be among them which the holy men of God cried wo against; and by the Spirit of the Living God thou art judged.

If ever thine eye see repentance, this thy condemnation thou must own.</P>

<P>I wrote also to—Burton, priest of Sedberg, to the same purpose, he being in the same evil ground, nature, and practice. Many other epistles also and papers I wrote about that time, as the Lord moved me thereunto, which I sent among the priests, professors, and people of all sorts, for the laying their evil ways open before them, that they might see and forsake them; and opening the way of truth unto them, that they might come to walk therein; which are too many and large to be inserted in this place.</P>
<P>After I had cleared my conscience to the priests and peo∣ple near Swarthmore, I went again into Westmoreland. A company of men with pikes and slaves laid wait for me at a bridge a the way; and they met with some friends, but missed me. Afterwards they came to the meeting with their pikes and staves; but justice Benson being there, and many considerable people besides, they were prevented from doing that mischief they intended. So they went away in a great rage, without hurting any body.</P>
<P>I went from the meeting to Grayrigg, and held a meet∣ing at Alexander Dickson's; to which the priest, who was a baptist and a chapel-priest, came to oppose but the Lord confounded him by his power. Some of the people tumbled down some milk-pails which stood upon the side of the house (which was much crowded) whereupon the priest, after he and his company were gone, raised a slan∣der, <Q>That the devil frighted him, and took away a side of the house, while he was in the meeting.</Q> And though this was a known falsehood, yet it served the priests and professors to feed on for awhile; and so shameless they were, that they printed and published it.</P>
<P>Another time this priest came to a meeting, and fell to jangling. First he said, <Q>The scriptures were the word of God.</Q> I told him, they were the words of God, but not
<PB N="125" REF="037441_0202_100D8EFC3A6C0248"/>Christ, the Word; and bid him prove by scripture what he said. Then he said, it was not the scripture that was the word; and setting his foot upon the bible, said, it was but copies bound up together. Many unsavory words came from him, but after he was gone we had a blessed meeting; the Lord's power and presence was preciously mainfested and felt among us. Soon after he sent me a challenge to meet him at Kendal. I sent him word he need not go so far as Kendal, for I would meet him in his own parish. The hour being fixed, we met, and abundance of rude peo∣ple gathered together (besides the baptized people who were his own members) with intent to do mischief, but God prevented-them. I declared the day of the Lord to them, and directed them to Christ Jesus. Then the priest out with his bible, and said, It was the word of God. I told him it was the words of God, but not God the Word. His answer was, He would prove the scriptures to be the word before all the people. I let him go on, having a man there that could take down in writing both what he and I said. When he could not prove it (for I kept him to scripture-proof, chapter and verse for it) the people gnashed their teeth for anger, and said, He would have me anon: but in going about to prove that one error, he ran into many. And when at length he saw he could not prove it, he said, he would prove it a God: so he toiled himself afresh, till he sweat again; but could not prove what he had affirmed. And he and his company were full of wrath: for I kept his assertions on the head of him and them all; and told them, I owned what the scriptures said of them∣selves, namely, that they were the words of God, but Christ was the Word. So the Lord's power came over all, and they being confounded went away. The Lord disappoint∣ed their mischievous intentions against me; friends were established in Christ, and many of the priest's followers saw the folly of their teacher.</P>
<P>After this, priest Bennet, of Cartmel, sent a challenge to dispute with me. I came to his steeple-house on a first-day, and found him preaching. When he had done, I spoke to him and his people; yet the priest would not stand the trial, but went his way. After he was gone, I had a great deal of discourse with the people: and when I was come into the steeple-house yard, discoursing further with the professors and declaring truth unto them, one of them set his foot behind me, and two of them ran against
<PB N="126" REF="037441_0203_100D8EFDD0A82900"/>my breast, and threw me down backwards against a grave∣stone, wickedly and maliciously seeking to have hurt me: but I got up again, and was moved of the Lord to speak to them. Then I went to the priest's house, and desired him to come forth that I might discourse with him, seeing he had challenged me; but he would not be seen. So the Lord's power came over them all, which was greatly mani∣fest at that time. There was amongst the priest's hearers one Richard Roper, one of the bitterest professors the priest had, who was very fierce and hot in contention; but after∣wards he came to be convinced of God's eternal truth, be∣came a minister thereof, and continued faithful to his death.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1653 I returned to Swarthmore, and going to a meeting at Gleaston, a profes∣sor challenged a dispute with me. I went to the house where he was, and called him to come forth; but the Lord's power was over him, so that he durst not meddle. I departed thence, visited the meetings of friends in Lanca∣shire, and came back to Swarthmore. Great openings I had from the Lord, not only of divine and spiritual matters, but also of outward things relating to the civil government. Being one day in Swarthmore-hall, when judge Fell and justice Benson were talking of the news, and of the parlia∣ment then sitting (called the long parliament) I was moved to tell them, Before that day two weeks the parliament should be broken up and the speaker plucked out of his chair; and that day two weeks justice Benson told judge Fell, that now he saw George was a true prophet; for Oli∣ver had broken up the parliament.</P>
<P>About this time I was in a fast for about ten days, my spirit being greatly exercised on truth's behalf: for James Milner and Richard Myer went out into imaginations, and a company followed them. This James Milner and some of his company had true openings at the first; but getting up into pride and exaltation of spirit, they ran out from truth. I was sent for to them, and was moved of the Lord to go and shew them their out-goings: and they were brought to see their folly, and condemned it, and came in∣to the way of truth again. After some time I went to a meeting at Arnside, where Richard Myer was, who had been long lame of one of his arms. I was moved of the Lord to say unto him amongst all the people, <Q>Stand up upon thy legs,</Q> for he was sitting down; and he stood up, and stretched out his arm that had been lame a long
<PB N="127" REF="037441_0204_100D8F0080579DB0"/>time, and said, <Q>Be it known unto you, all people, that this day I am healed.</Q> Yet his parents could hardly be∣lieve it; but after the meeting was done, had him aside, took off his doublet, and then saw it was true. He came soon after to Swarthmore meeting, and there declared how the Lord had healed him. Yet after this the Lord com∣manded him to go to York with a message from him; which he disobeyed, and the Lord struck him again, so that he died about three quarters of a year after.</P>
<P>Now were great threatenings given forth in Cumberland, That if ever I came there, they would take away my life. When I heard it. I was drawn to go into Cumberland; and went to Miles Wennington's, in the same parish from which those threatenings came: but they had not power to touch me.</P>
<P>About this time Anthony Pearson was convinced, who had been an opposer of friends. He came to Swarthmore; and I being then at colonel West's, they sent for me. Co∣lonel West said, <Q>Go, George, for it may be of great ser∣vice to the man.</Q> So I went, and the Lord's power reached him.</P>
<P>About this time also the Lord opened several mounths to declare the truth to priests and people, and divers were cast into prison. I went again into Cumberland; and Antho∣ny Pearson and his wife, and several friends, went along with me to Bootle, where Anthony left me, and went to Carlisle sessions: for he was a justice of the peace in three counties. Upon the first-day I went into the steeple-house at Bootle; and when the priest had done, I began to speak. The people were exceeding rude, and beat me in the steeple-house yard. One gave me a very great blow over my wrist, so that the people thought he had broken my hand to pieces. The constable was very willing to have kept the peace, and would have set some of those by the heals that struck me, if I would have given way to it. After my service amongst them was over, I went to Joseph Nicholson's, and the constable accompanied us, to keep off the rude multitude. In the afternoon I went up again; and then the priest had got another priest to help him, that came from London, who was highly accounted of. Before I went into the steeple-house, I sat a little upon the cross, and friends with me; but they were moved to go into the steeple-house, and I went in after them. The London priest was preaching, who gathered up all the scriptures he
<PB N="128" REF="037441_0205_100D8F02A2AF5948"/>could think of, that spake of false prophets, antichrists, and deceivers, and threw them upon us. When he had done, I recollected all those scriptures, and brought them back upon himself. Then the people fell upon me in a rude manner; but the constable charged them to keep the peace, and made them quiet again. Then the priest began to rage; and said, I must not speak there. I told him, He had his hour-glass, by which he had preached; and he having done, the time was free for me, as well as for him: for he was but a stranger there himself. So I opened the scriptures to them, and let them see, <Q>That those scriptures, which spake of the false prophets, antichrists, and deceivers, described them and their generation, and belonged to them who were found walking in their sleps, and bringing forth their fruits; and not unto us, who were not guilty of such things.</Q> I manifested to them, that they were out of the steps of the true prophets and apostles; and shewed them clearly, by the fruits and marks, that they, and not we, were such as those scriptures spoke of. And I declared the truth and the word of life to the people, and directed them to Christ their teacher. All was quiet while I was speak∣ing; but when I had done, and was come forth; the priests were in such a fret and rage, that they foamed at the mouth for anger against me. The priest of the place made an ora∣tion to the people in the steeple-house yard, saying, <Q>This man hath gotten all the honest men and women in Lan∣cashire to him, and now he come here to do the same.</Q> Then said I to him, <Q>What wilt thou have left? And what have the priests left them, but such as themselves? For if they be the honest that receive the truth and are turned to Christ, then they must be the dishonest that follow thee, and such as thou art.</Q> Some also of the priest's people began to plead for their priest, and for tythes. I told them, It were better for them to plead for Christ, who had ended the tything priesthood with the tythes, and had sent forth his ministers to give freely, as they had received freely. So the rude people, that they could not do the mischief they intended. When I came down again to Joseph Nichol∣son's house, I saw a great hole in my coat, which was cut with a knife, but it was not cut through my waistcoat for the Lord had prevented their mischief. The next day there was a rude wicked man would have done violence to a friend, but the Lord's power stopped him.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="037441_0206_100D8F055893FA18"/>
Now was I moved to send James Lancaster to appoint a meeting at John Wilkinson's steeple-house near Cocker∣mouth; a preacher in great repute, who had three parishes under him; wherefore I staid at Milholm in Bootle till he came back again. In the mean time some of the gentry of the country had formed a plot against me, and had given a little boy a rapier to do me a mischief with. They came with the boy to Joseph Nicholson's to seek me; but the Lord had so ordered it, I was gone into the fields. They met with James Lancaster, but did not much abuse him; and not finding me in the house, went away again. So I walked up and down in the fields that night, and did not go to bed as very often I used to do. We came the next day to the steeple-house, where James Lancaster had ap∣pointed the meeting. There were at this meeting twelve soldiers and their wives, from Carlisle; and the country people came in, like as it had been to a fair. I lay at an house somewhat short of the place, so that many friends were got thither before me. When I came, I found James Lancaster speaking under a yew-tree; which was so full of people, I feared they would break it down. I looked about for a place to stand upon, to speak unto the people: for they lay all up and down, like people at a leaguer. After I was discovered, a professor asked, If I would not go into the church? I seeing no place abroad convenient to speak to the people from, told him, Yes: whereupon the people rushed in; so that when I came, the house and pulpit was so full, I had much ado to get in. Those that could not get in, stood abroad about the walls. When the people were settled, I stood up on a seat. <Q>And the Lord opened my mouth to declare his everlasting truth and his ever∣lasting day; and to lay open their teachers, with the rudi∣ments, traditions, and inventions they had been under in the night of apostacy since the apostles days. I turned them to Christ the true teacher, and to the true spiritual worship; directing them where to find the Spirit and truth, that they might worship God therein. I explained Christ's parables unto them, and directed them to the Spirit of God in themselves, that would open the scrip∣tures unto them. I shewed them, how all might come to know their Saviour, fit under his teaching, come to be heirs of the kingdom of God, and know God's and Christ's voice, by which they might discover all the false shep∣herds and teachers they had been under, and be gathered
<PB N="130" REF="037441_0207_100D8F06EECF1010"/>to the true Shepherd, Priest, Bishop, and Prophet Christ Jesus, whom God commanded all to hear.</Q></P>
<P>When I had largely declared the word of life unto them for about the space of three hours, I walked from amongst the people, who passed away well satisfied. Among the rest a professor followed me, praising and commending me; but his words were like a thistle to me. At last I turned about, and bid him 'Fear the Lord;' whereupon priest Larkham of Cockermouth (for several priests were got to∣gether on the way, who came after the meeting was done) said to me, <Q>Sir, why do you judge so? you must not judge.</Q> I turned to him, and said, <Q>Friend, dost thou not discern an exhortation from a judgment? I admo∣nished him to fear God; and dost thou say I judge him?</Q> So this priest and I falling into discourse, I mani∣fested him to be amongst the false prophets and covetous hirelings; and several being moved to speak to them, he and two other of the priests soon got away. When they were gone, John Wilkinson, preacher of that parish, and of two other parishes in Cumberland, began to dispute against his own conscience for several hours, till the people generally turned against him: for he thought to have tired me out; but the Lord's power tired him out, and the Lord's truth came over him and them all. Many hundreds were convinced that day, who received the Lord Jesus Christ and his free teaching with gladness; of whom some have died in the truth, and many stand faithful witnesses thereof. The soldiers also were convinced and their wives, and continued with me till first-day.</P>
<P>On first-day I went to the steeple-house at Cockermouth, where priest Larkham lived. When he had done, I began to speak, and the people began to be rude; but the soldi∣ers told them, we had broken no law, and they became quiet. Then I turned to the priest, and laid him open among the false prophets and hirelings; at which word he went his way, saying, 'He calls me hireling;' which was true; all the people knew it. 'Some great men of the town said,' 'Sir, we have no learned men to dispute with you.' I told them, I came not to dispute, but to shew the way of salvation to them, the way of everlasting life. I decla∣red largely the way of life and truth to them, and directed them to Christ their teacher, who died for them, and bought them with his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="037441_0208_100D8F08873F7030"/>
When I had done, I went about two miles to another great steeple-house of John Wilkinson's, called Brigham; where the people, having been at the other meeting, were mightily affected, and would have put my horse into the steeple-house yard: but I said, <Q>No; the priest claims that; have him to an inn.</Q> When I came into the stee∣ple-house yard, I saw the people coming in great compa∣nies, as to a fair; and abundance were already gathered in the lanes and about the steeple-house. I was very thirsty, and walked about a quarter of a mile to a brook, where I got some water, and refreshed myself. As I came up again, I met Wiskinson; who, as I passed by him, said, 'Sir, will you preach to-day? If you will,' said he, <Q>I will not oppose you in word or thought.</Q> I replied, <Q>Oppose, if thou wilt; I have something to speak to the people. And,</Q> said I, <Q>thou carriedst thyself foolishly the other day, and spakest against thy conscience and reason, inso∣much, that thy hearers cried out against thee.</Q> So I left him, and went on; for he saw it was in vain to oppose, the people were so affected with the Lord's truth. When I came into the steeple-house yard, a professor asked, If I would not go into the church? And I seeing no convenient place abroad, went in; and stood up on a seat, after the people were settled. The priest came in also, but did not go up to his pulpit. <Q>The Lord opened my mouth, and I declared his everlasting truth and word of life to the people; directing them to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might know God, Christ, and the scrip∣tures, and come to have heavenly fellowship in the Spirit. I declared to them, that every one that cometh into the world was enlightened by Christ the life; by which light they might see their sins, and Christ, who was come to save them from their sins, and died for them. And if they came to walk in this light, they might therein see Christ to be the author of their faith, and the finisher thereof; their Shepherd to feed them, their Priest to teach them, their great Prophet to open divine mysteries unto them, and to be always present with them. I explained also to them, in the openings of the Lord, the first convenant, shewing them the figures, and the substance of those figures; bringing them on to Christ, the new covenant. I also manifested to them, that there had been a night of apostacy since the apostles days; but that now the ever∣lasting gospel was preached again, which brought life and
<PB N="132" REF="037441_0209_100D8F0BF03C28E8"/>immortality to light; and the day of the Lord was come, and Christ was come to teach his people himself by his light, grace, power, and spirit.</Q> A fine opportunity the Lord gave me to preach truth that day for about three hours, and all was quiet. Many hundreds were convinced; and some of them praised God, and said, <Q>Now we know the first step to peace.</Q> The preacher also said privately to some of his hearers, that I had broken them, and over∣thrown them.</P>
<P>After this I went to a village, and many people accom∣panied me. As I was sitting in an house full of people, declaring the word of life unto them, I cast mine eye upon a woman, and discerned an unclean spirit in her. I was moved of the Lord to speak sharply to her; and told her, she was under the influence of an unclean spirit. Where∣upon the woman went out of the room. I being a stranger there, and knowing nothing of the woman outwardly, the people wondered, and told me afterwards, I had discovered a great thing: for all the country looked upon her to be a wicked person. The Lord had given me a Spirit of dis∣cerning, by which I many times saw the states and condi∣tions of people, and could try their spirits. Not long be∣fore, as I was going to a meeting, I saw some women in a field, and discerned an evil spirit in them; and I was mov∣ed to go out of my way into the field to them, and declare unto them their conditions. Another time there came one into Swarthmore hall in the meeting-time, and I was mov∣ed to speak sharply to her, and told her she was under the power of an evil spirit; and the people said afterwards, she was generally accounted so to be. There came also another time a woman, and stood at a distance from me. I cast mine eye upon her, and said, 'Thou hast been an harlot:' for I perfectly saw the condition and life of the woman. She answered, Many could tell her of her outward sins, but none could tell her of her inward. I told her, Her heart was not right before the Lord; and that from the in∣ward came the outward. This woman was afterwards con∣vinced of God's truth, and became a friend.</P>
<P>From the aforesaid village we came to Thomas Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley's, near Coldbeck; and from thence, having had some service for the Lord there, I passed to a market-town, where I had a meeting at the cross; and all was pretty quiet. When I had declared the truth unto them, and directed them to Christ their teacher, some received the truth. We had
<PB N="133" REF="037441_0210_100D8F0D9A8379C0"/>another meeting upon the borders, in a steeple-house yard, to which many professors and contenders came; but the Lord's power was over all; and when the word of life had been declared amongst them, some received the truth there also.</P>
<P>From thence we travelled to Carlisle, and the pastor of the baptists, with most of his hearers, came to the abbey, where I had a meeting, and declared the word of life amongst them. Many of the baptists and of the soldiers were convinced. After the meeting, the pastor of the bap∣tists, an high notionist, and a flashy man, asked me, <Q>What must be damned?</Q> I was moved immediately to tell him, 'That which spoke in him was to be damned.' This stop∣ped his mouth; and the witness of God was raised up in him. I opened to him the states of election and reproba∣tion; so that he said, He never heard the like in his life. He came afterwards to be convinced.</P>
<P>Then I went to the castle among the soldiers; who beat a drum, and called the garrison together. I preached the truth amongst them, <Q>directing them to the Lord Jesus Christ to be their teacher, and to the measure of his Spirit in themselves, by which they might be turned from dark∣ness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. I warned them all, that they should do no violence to any man, but should shew forth a christian life: telling them, that be who was to be their teacher, would be their con∣demner, if they were disobedient to him.</Q> So I left them, having no opposition from any of them, except the ser∣jeants, who afterwards came to be convinced.</P>
<P>On the market-day I went to the cross. The magistrates had both threatened, and sent their serjeants; and the ma∣gistrates wives had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> If I came there, they would pluck the hair off my head; and the serjeants should take me up. Nevertheless I obeyed the Lord God, went upon the cross, and declared unto them, <Q>That the day of the Lord was coming upon all their deceitful ways and doings, and de∣ceitful merchandize; that they should put away all cozen∣ing and cheating, and keep to Yea and Nay, and speak the truth one to another: so the truth and the power of God was set over them.</Q> After I had declared the word of life to the people, the throng being so great that the serjeants could not reach me, nor the magistrates wives come at me, I passed away quietly. Many people and soldiers came to me, and some baptists, that were bitter contenders; amongst
<PB N="134" REF="037441_0211_100D8F0FDC720F08"/>whom one of their deacons, an envious man, finding the Lord's power was over them, cried out for very anger. Whereupon I set my eyes upon him, and spoke sharply to him in the power of the Lord: and he cried, <Q>Do not pierce me so with thy eyes, keep thy eyes off me.</Q></P>
<P>The first-day following I went into the steeple-house: and after the priest had done, I preached the truth to the people, and declared the word of life amongst them. The priest got away; and the magistrates desired me to go out of the steeple-house. But I still declared the way of the Lord unto them, and told them, I came to speak the word of life and salvation from the Lord amongst them. The power of the Lord was dreadful amongst them, so that the people trembled and shook; and they thought the steeple-house shook; some of them feared it would have fallen down on their heads. The magistrates wives were in a rage, and strove mightily to have been at me: but the soldiers and friendly people stood thick about me. At length the rude people of the city rose, and came with staves and stones into the steeple-house, crying, <Q>Down with these round-headed rogues:</Q> and they threw stones. Where∣upon the governor sent a file or two of musqueteers into the steeple-house to appease the tumult; and com∣manded all the other soldiers out. So those soldiers took me by the hand in a friendly manner, and said, they would have me along with them. When we came into the street, the city was in an uproar; the governor came down; and some of those soldiers were put in prison for standing by me against the town's-people. A lieutenant, who had been convinced, came and brought me to his house, where there was a baptist meeting, and thither came friends also. We had a very quiet meeting; they heard the word of life glad∣ly, and many received it. The next day, the justices and magistrates of the town being gathered together in the town-hall, they granted a warrant against me; and sent for me before them. I was then gone to a baptist's; but hearing of it, I went up to the hall, where many rude people were: some of whom had sworn strange false things against me. I had a great deal of discourse with the magistrates, wherein I laid open the fruits of their priests preaching; shewed them how they were void of Christianity; and that, though they were such great professors (for they were independents and presbyterians) they were without the possession of that which they profeised. After a large examination, they com∣mitted
<PB N="135" REF="037441_0212_100D8F11C392B7F8"/>me to prison as a blasphemer, an heretick, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ducer; though they could not justly charge any such thing against me. The gaol at Carlisle had two gaolers, an up∣per and an under, who looked like two bear-wards. When I was brought in, the upper gaoler had me up into a great chamber, and told me, I should have what I would in that room. But I told him, he should not expect any money from me, for I would neither lie in any of his beds, nor eat any of his victuals. Then he put me into another room; where after awhile I got something to lie upon. There I lay till the assizes came; and then all the talk was, that I was to be hanged. The high sheriff, Wilfred Lawson, stir∣red them much up to take away my life; and said, He would guard me to my execution himself. They were in a rage, and set three musqueteers for guard upon me; one at my chamber-door, another at the stairs-foot, and a third at the street-door; and they would let none come at me, except one sometimes, to bring me some necessary things. At night they would bring up priests to me, sometimes as late as the tenth hour; who were exceeding rude and de∣vilish. There were a company, of bitter Scotch priests, presbyterians, made up of envy and malice, who were not sit to speak of the things of God, they were so foul-mouthed; but the Lord by his power gave me dominion over them all, and I let them see both their fruits and their spirits. Great ladies also (as they were called) came to see the man that they said was to die. While the judge, justices, and sheriff were contriving together how they might put me to death, the Lord disappointed their designs by an unexpect∣ed way. For the judge's clerk, as I was informed, started a question among them, which confounded all their coun∣sels; after which, they had not power to call me before the judge.</P>
<P>Anthony Pearson being then in Carlisle, and perceiving they did not intend to bring me upon my trial, wrote a letter to the judges, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the judges of assize and gaol-delivery for the north∣ern parts, sitting at Carlisle.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are raised up to do righteousness and justice, and sent forth to punish him that doth evil, and to en∣courage him that doth well, and to set the oppressed free. I am therefore moved to lay before you the condition of
<PB N="136" REF="037441_0213_100D8F1490354EA8"/>GEORGE FOX, whom the magistrates of this city have cast into prison for words that he is accused to have spo∣ken, which they call blasphemy. He was sent to the gaol, till he should be delivered by due course of law; and it was expected he should have been proceeded against in the common law-course at this assizes. The informations against him were delivered into court, and the act al∣lows and appoints that way of trial. How hardly and unchristianly he hath been hitherto dealt with, I shall not now mention; but you may consider, that nothing he is accused of is nice and difficult. And, to my knowledge, he utterly abhors and detests every particular which by the act against blasphemous opinions is appointed to be punished, and differs as much from those people against whom the law was made, as light from darkness. Though he be committed, judgment is not given him, nor have his accusers been face to face, to affirm before him what they have informed against him; nor was he heard as to the particulars of their accusation, nor doth it appear that any word they charge against him is within the act. But indeed I could not yet so much as see the information, no not in court, though I desired it both of the clerk of the assizes and of the magistrate's clerk; nor hath he had a copy of them. This is very hard; and that he should be so close restrained, that his friends may not speak with him, I know no law nor reason for. I do therefore claim for him a due and lawful hearing, and that he may have a copy of his charge, and freedom to answer for himself; and that rather before you, than to be left to the rulers of this town, who are not competent judges of blasphemy, as by their mittimus appears; who have committed him upon an act of parliament, and mention words as spoken by him at his examination which are not within the act, and which he utterly denies. The words mentioned in the mittimus he denies to have spoken, and hath neither pro∣fessed nor avowed them.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding this letter, the judges were resolved not to suffer me to be brought before them; but reviling and scoffing at me behind my back, left me to the magistrates of the town: giving them what encouragement they could to exercise their cruelty upon me. Whereupon (though I had been kept so close in the gaoler's house that friends
<PB N="137" REF="037441_0214_100D8F16CD0845F0"/>were not suffered to come at me, and colonel. Benson and justice Pearson were denied to see me, yet) the next day, after the judges were gone out of town, an order was sent to the gaoler to put me down into the prison amongst the moss-troopers, thieves, and murderers; which accordingly he did. A filthy, nasty place it was, where men and wo∣men were put together in a very uncivil manner, and never a house of office to it; and the prisoners so lousy, that one woman was almost eaten to death with lice. Yet as bad as the place was, the prisoners were all made very loving and subject to me, and some of them were convinced of the truth, as the publicans and harlots were of old; so that they were able to confound any priest that might come to the grates to dispute. But the gaoler was cruel, and the under-gaoler very abusive both to me and to friends that came to see me; for he would beat friends with a great cudgel, who did but come to the window to look in upon me. I could get up to the grate, where sometimes I took in my meat; at which the gaoler was often offended. Once he came in a great rage, and beat me with his cudgel, though I was not at the grate at that time; and as he beat me, he cried, come out of the window, though I was then far from it. While he struck me, I was moved to sing in the Lord's pow∣er, which made him rage the more. Then he fetched a fiddler, and set him to play, thinking to vex me; but while he played, I was moved in the everlasting power of the Lord God to sing; and my voice drowned the noise of the fiddle, struck and confounded them, and made them give over fiddling and go their way.</P>
<P>Justice Benson's wife was moved of the Lord to come to visit me, and to eat no meat but what she eat with me at the bars of the prison window. She was afterwards her∣self imprisoned at York, when she was great with child, for speaking to a priest; and was kept in prison, and not suffered to go out when the time of her travail was come: so she was delivered of her child in the prison. She was an honest, tender woman, and continued faithful to the truth until she died.</P>
<P>Whilst I was in prison at Carlisle, James Parnel, a little lad about sixteen years of age, came to see me, and was convinced. The Lord quickly made him a powerful mi∣nister of the word of life, and many were turned to Christ by him, though he lived not long. For travelling into Essex in the work of the ministry, in the year 1655, he
<PB N="138" REF="037441_0215_100D8F18F6C053B0"/>was committed to Colchester castle, where he endured very great hardships and sufferings; being put by the cruel gaoler into a hole in the castle wall, called the oven, so high from the ground that he went up to it by a ladder, which being six feet too short, he was obliged to climb from the ladder to the hole by a rope that was fastened above. And when friends would have given him a cord and a bas∣ket to have drawn up his victuals in, the inhuman gaoler would not suffer them, but forced him to go down and up by that short ladder and rope to fetch his victuals (which for a long time he did) or else he might have fa∣mished in the hole. At length his limbs being much be∣numbed with lying in that place, yet being obliged to go down to take up some victuals, as he came up the ladder again with his victuals in one hand, and catched at the rope with the other, he missed the rope and fell down from a very great height upon the stones; by which fall he was so wounded in his head, arms, and body, that he died in a short time after. When he was dead the wicked professors, to cover their cruelty, wrote a book of him, and said, "He fasted himself to death!" which was an abominable falsehood, and was manifested so to be by another book, wrote in answer to that, called, <Q>The Lamb's Defence against Lies.</Q></P>
<P>When I saw that I was not like to be brought to a pub∣lick hearing and trial (although I had before answered in writing the particular matters charged against me at the time of my first examination and commitment) I was mo∣ved to send the following paper, as a publick challenge to all those that belied the truth and me behind my back, to come forth and make good their charge.</P>

<P>While I thus lay in prison, the report raised at the time of the assizes, "That I should be put to death," was gone far and near; insomuch that the parliament then sitting, which I think was called the little parliament, hearing that a young man at Carlisle was to die for religion, caused a let∣ter to be sent to the sheriff and magistrates concerning me.

<P>YOUR noise is gone up to London before the sober people. What imprisoning, what gagging, what havock and spoiling the goods of people have you made within these few years! Unlike men; as though you had never read the scriptures, or had not minded them! Is this the end of Carlisle's religion? Is this the end of your ministry? Is this the end of your church, and of your profession of christianity? You have shamed it by your folly, madness, and blind zeal. Was it not always the work of the blind guides, watchmen, leaders, and false prophets, to prepare war against them that could not put into their mouths? Have not you been the priests pack∣horses and executioners? When they spur you up to bear the sword against the just, do not you run on against those that cannot hold up such as the scriptures always testified against? Yet will you lift up your unholy hands, and call upon God with your polluted lips, and pretend a fast, who are full of strife and debate. Did your hearts never burn within you? Did you never come to question your
<PB N="140" REF="037441_0217_100D8F1CB5F93AF0"/>conditions? Are you wholly given up to do the devil's lusts, to persecute? Where is your loving enemies? Where is your entertaining strangers? Where is your overcoming evil with good? Where are your teachers, that can stop the mouths of gain-sayers, convince gain-sayers, and such as oppose themselves? Have you no ministers of the Spi∣rit, no soldiers with spiritual weapons, displaying Christ's colours? But all the dragon's, the murderer's, the perse∣cutor's, arm of flesh, Cain's weapons, chief priests taking counsel, Judas and the multitude with swords and staves, Sodom's company raging about Lot's house, like the priests and princes against Jeremiah, like the dragon, beast, and great whore, and the false church, which John saw should cast into prison, kill, and persecute? Whose weapons are you bearing? Doth not the false church, the whore, make merchandize of cattle, corn, wine, and oil, even to the very souls of men? Hath not all this been since the true church went into the wilderness? Read Revelations the 12th, with the 18th: do you not read and see what a spirit you are of, and what a bottomless pit you are in? Have not you dishonoured the place of justice and authority? What! turned your sword back∣ward, like madmen, who are a praise to the evil-doer, and would be a terror to the good, with all force and might to stop the way of justice! Doth not the Lord, think you, behold your actions? How many have you wronged? How many have you imprisoned, persecuted, and put out of your synagogues? Are you they that must fulfil the prophecy of Christ, Matth. xxiii. John xvi. Read the scriptures, see how unhke you are to the prophets, Christ, and his apostles, and what a visage you have, like unto them that persecuted the prophets, Christ, and the apos∣tles. You are found in their steps, wrestling with flesh and blood, not with principalities and powers, and spiri∣tual wickedness; your teachers imprisoning and perse∣cuting for outward things, you being their executioners; the like whereof hath not been in all the nations. The havork that hath been made, the spoiling of people's goods, taking away their oxen and fatted beeves, their sheep, corn, wool, and houshold goods, and giving them to the priests that have done no work for them. More like moss-troopers than ministers of the gospel, they take them from friends; suing them in your courts, and fining them because they will not break the command of Christ;
<PB N="141" REF="037441_0218_100D8F1F93AA5510"/>that is, because they will not swear. Thus you act against them that do not lift up a hand against you, and as much as you turn against them you turn against Christ. But he is risen that will plead their cause, and you cannot be hid. Your works are come to light, and the end of your ministry is seen, what it is for; for means. You have dis∣honoured the truth, the gospel; and are of those that make it chargeable. You have lost your glory. You have dis∣honoured yourselves. Persecution was ever blind and mad. Read the apostle, what he saith of himself, when he was in your nature. Exaltation and pride, and your lifting up yourselves, hath brought you to this; not being humble, not doing justice, not loving mercy. When such as have been beaten and bruised by your rude company to whom you are a praise and encouragement, have come and laid things before you, that you might have done jus∣tice, preserved and kept peace, you knowing they could not swear, have put an oath to them. This hath been your trick and cover, that ye might not do justice to the just; but by this means go on still further to encourage the evil-doer. But the Lord sees your hearts! If ye were not men past feeling, ye would fear and tremble before the God of the whole earth; who is risen, and will stain your glory, mar your pride, deface your beauty, and lay it in the dust. Though for a time you may swell in your pride, glory in your shame, and make a mock of God's messengers, who, for reproving sin in the gate, are become your prey; you will feel the heavy hand of God and his judgments at the last. This is from a lover of the truth, of righteousness, and of your souls; but a witness against all such as make a trade of the prophets, Christ's, and the apostles words, and are found in the steps of them who persecuted the prophets, Christ's and the apostles life; who persecute those that will not hold you up, put into your mouths, and give you means. Tithes were before the law, and tithes were in the law; but tithes since the days of the apostles have been only since the false church got up. Christ, who is come to end the law, and to end war, redeems men out of the tenths, and out of the nines also. The redeemed of the Lord shall reign upon the earth, and know the election which was before the world began. Since the days of the apostles, tithes have been set up by the papists, and by them that went from the apostles into the world; set up by the false church that
<PB N="142" REF="037441_0219_100D8F219C46EFF8"/>made merchandize of the people, since the true chutch went into the wilderness. But now is the judgment of the great whore come; the beast and false prophet (the old dragon) shall be taken and cast into the fire, and the Lamb and his saints shall have the victory. Now it Christ come who will make war in righteousness, and de∣stroy with the sword of his mouth all these inventors and inventions that have been set up since the days of the apostles, and since the true church went into the wilder∣ness. and the everlasting gospel, which is the power of God, shall be preached again to all nations, kindreds, and tongues in this the Lamb's day; before whom you shall appear to judgment. You have no way to escape. For he hath appeared who is the First and the Last, the Be∣ginning and the Ending, the Alpha and the Omega: he that was dead is alive again, and lives for evermore!</P>

<P>I mentioned before, that Gervase Benson and Anthony Pearson, though they had been justices of the peace, were not permitted to come to me in the prison; whereupon they jointly wrote a letter to the magistrates, priests, and people at Carlisle, concerning my imprisonment: thus,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>HE who is called George Fox, who is persecuted by rulers and magistrates, by justices, priests, and pec∣ple, and who suffers the imprisonment of his body at this present time as a blasphemer, an heretick, and a seducer, him do we witness (who in measure are made partakers of the same life which lives in him) to be a minister of the eternal word of God, by whom the everlasting gospel is preached; by the powerful preaching whereof the eternal Father of the saints hath opened the blind eyes, unstop∣ped the deaf ears, let the oppressed go free, and hath rais∣ed the dead out of the graves. Christ is now preached in and among the saints, the same that ever he was; and because his heavenly image is borne up in this his faithful servant, therefore doth fallen man (rulers, priests, and people) persecute him. Because he lives up out of the fall, and testifies against the works of the world, that the deeds thereof are evil, he suffers by you magistrates, not as an evil-doer. Thus it was ever where the seed of God was kept in prison under the cursed nature, that nature sought to imprison them in whom it was raised. The Lord will make him to you as a burdensome stone; for
<PB N="143" REF="037441_0220_100D8F2393E73318"/>the sword of the Spirit of the Almighty is put into the hands of the saints, which shall wound all the wicked; and shall not be put up till it hath cut down all corrupt judges, justices, magistrates, priests and professors; till be hath brought his wonderful thing to pass in the earth, which is to make new heavens and a new earth, where∣in shall dwell righteousness; which now he is about to do. Therefore fear the Lord God Almighty, ye judges, justices, commanders, priests, and people; ye that for∣get God, suddenly will the Lord come and destroy you with an utter destruction, and will sweep your names out of the earth, and will restore his people judges as at the first, and counsellors as at the beginning. And all persecutors shall partake of the plagues of the whore, who hath made the kings of the earth and the great men drunk with the wine of her fornications, and hath drunk the blood of the saints; and therefore shall you be partakers of her plagues. We are not suffered to see our friend in prison, whom we witness to be a messenger of the Living God. Now, all people, mind whether this be according to law, or from the wicked, perverse, envious will of the envious rulers and magistrates, who are of the same gene∣ration that persecuted Jesus Christ; for the said, <Q>as they have done to me, so will they do to you.</Q> And as he took the love, the kindness, and service that was shewed and performed to any of his afflicted ones in their suffer∣ings and distress, as done unto himself; so the injuries and wrongs that were done by any to any of his little ones, he resented as done unto himself also. Therefore you, who are so far from visiting him yourselves in his suffering servant that ye will not suffer his brethren to visit him, ye must depart, ye workers of iniquity, into the lake that burns with fire. The Lord is coming to thresh the mountains, and will beat them to dust; and all cor∣rupt rulers, corrupt officers, and corrupt laws, the Lord will take vengeance on, by which the tender consciences of his people are oppressed. He will give his people his law, and will judge his people himself, not according to the sight of the eye and hearing of the ear, but with righteousness and equity. Now are your hearts made manifest to be full of envy against the living truth of God. which is made manifest in his people, who are contemned and despised of the world, and scornfully called Quakers. You are worse than the heathens that put Paul in prison,
<PB N="144" REF="037441_0221_100D8F25AA96B5C0"/>for none of his friends or acquaintance were hindered to come to him by them: therefore they shall be witnesses against you. Ye are made manifest to the saints to be of the same generation that put Christ to death, and that put the apostle in prison, on the same pretence as you act under; in calling truth error, and the ministers of God blasphemers, as they did. But the day is dreadful and terrible that shall come upon you, ye evil magistrates, priests, and people, who profess the truth in words out∣wardly, and yet persecute the power of truth and them that stand in and for the truth. While ye have time, prize it, and remember what is written, Isa. liv. 17.</P>

<P>Not long after this the Lord's power came over the justi∣ces, and they were made to set me at liberty. But some time before the governor and Anthony Pearson came down into the prison to see the place where I was kept, and un∣derstand what usage I had. They found the place so bad, and the favour so ill, that they cried shame of the magis∣trates for suffering the gaoler to do such things. They cal∣led for the gaolers into the prison, and required them to find sureties for their good behaviour; and the under-gaol∣er who had been such a cruel fellow, they put into the pri∣son with me amongst the moss-troopers.</P>
<P>After I was set at liberty I went to Thomas Bewley's, where came a baptist-teacher to oppose me; who was con∣vinced. Robert Widders being with me was moved to go to Coldbeck steeple-house, and the baptist-teacher went along with him the same day. The people fell upon them, almost killed Robert Widders, and took the baptist's sword from him and beat him sorely. This baptist had the inhe∣ritance of an impropriation of tithes, and he went home and gave it up freely. Robert Widders was sent to Carlisle gaol, where having lain awhile he was set at liberty. Wil∣liam Dewsbury also went to a steeple-house hard by, and the people almost killed him, they beat him so; but the Lord's power was over all and healed them again. In that day many friends went to the steeple-houses to declare the truth to the priests and people; and great sufferings they underwent, but the Lord's power sustained them.</P>
<P>Now I went into the country, and had mighty great
<PB N="145" REF="037441_0222_100D8F27A4F31370"/>meetings. The everlasting gospel and word of life flou∣rished, thousands were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ and to his teaching. Several who had taken tithes as im∣propriators denied the receiving of them any longer, and delivered them up freely to the parishioners. Passing into Westmoreland I had many great meetings. At Strickland∣bead I had a large meeting, where Henry Draper, a justice of peace out of Bishoprick, came, and many contenders were there. The priests and magistrates were in a great rage against me in Westmoreland, and had a warrant to ap∣prehend me; which they renewed from time to time. Yet the Lord did not suffer them to serve it upon me. I tra∣velled amongst friends, visiting meetings till I came to Swarthmore, where I heard the baptists and professors in Scotland had sent to have a dispute with me. I sent them word, I would meet them in Cumberland at Thomas Bew∣ley's, whither accordingly I went, but none of them came. Some dangers at this time I underwent in my travels. Going through Wigton on a market-day, the people of the town had set a guard with pitch-forks; and though some of their own neighbours were with us, they kept us out of the town and would not let us pass through it, under a pretence of preventing the sickness, which there was no occasion for. However, they fell upon us, and had like to have spoiled us and our horses; but the Lord restrained them, that they did not much hurt; and we passed away. Another time, as we were passing between two friends houses, some rude fellows lay in wait in a lane, and exceed∣ingly stoned and abused us; but at last, through the Lord's assistance, we got through them, and had not much hurt. But this shewed the fruits of the priest's teaching, which shamed their profession of christianity.</P>
<P>After I had visited friends in that county. I went into Bishoprick, having large meetings by the way. A very large meeting I had at Anthony Pearson's, where many were convinced. From thence I passed through Northumber∣land to Derwentwater, where we had great meetings; and the priests threatened they would come, but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> came. The everlasting word of life was freely preached, and freely re∣ceived; hundreds being turned to Christ, their teacher.</P>
<P>In Northumberland many came to dispute. Some pleaded against perfection; to whom I declared, <Q>That Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell: and all that God made was perfect; and that the imperfection came
<PB N="146" REF="037441_0223_100D8F29C2612180"/>by the devil and the fall: but Christ, who came to de∣stroy the devil,</Q> said, "Be ye perfect." One of the pro∣fessors alledged that Job said, <Q>Shall mortal man be more pure than his Maker? The heavens are not clean in his sight. God charged his angels with folly.</Q> I shewed him his mistake, and let him see, <Q>it was not Job that said so, but one of those that contended against him; for Job stood for perfection, and held his integrity; and they were called miserable comforters.</Q> These professors said, The outward body was the body of death and sin. I discovered their mistake in that also, shewing them, <Q>That Adam and Eve had each of them an outward body, before the body of death and sin got into them; and that man and woman will have bodies, when the body of sin and death is put off again; when they are renewed up into the image of God again by Christ Jesus, which they were in before they fell.</Q> They ceased at that time from opposing, and glorious meetings we had in the Lord's power.</P>
<P>Then passed we to Hexam, where we had a great meet∣ing atop of an hill. The priest threatened he would come and oppose us, but he came not; so all was quiet: And <Q>the everlasting day and renowned truth of the everliving God was sounded over those dark countries, and his Son exalted over all. It was proclaimed amongst the people, that the day was now come, wherein all that made a pro∣fession of the Son of God, might receive him; and that to as many as would receive him, he would give power to become the sons of God, as he had done to me.</Q> It was further declared, <Q>That he who had the Son of God, had life eternal; but he that had not the Son of God (though he professed all the scriptures, from the first of Genesis to the last of the Revelations) had no life.</Q> So after all were directed to the light of Christ, by which they might see him, receive him, and know where their true teacher was, and the everlasting truth had been largely de∣clared amongst them, we passed through Hexam peacea∣bly, and came into Gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land, a country noted for thiev∣ing.</P>
<P>Here a friend spying the priest, went to speak to him; wherenpon he came to our inn, and the town's-people ga∣thered about us. The priest said, He would prove us de∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vers out of the bible, but could find no scripture for his purpose. Then he went into the inn, and after awhile came out again, and brought some broken sentences of scripture,
<PB N="147" REF="037441_0224_100D8F2B9E6186E0"/>that mention the doctrines and commandments of men, &amp;c. and Touch not. Taste not. &amp;c. for they perish with the using. All which, poor man! was his own condition; whereas we were persecuted because we would not taste, nor touch, nor handle their doctrines and traditions which we knew perished with using. I asked him, What he called the steeple-house? 'Oh,' said he, <Q>the dreadful house of God, the temple of God.</Q> I shewed him, and the poor, dark people, <Q>That their bodies should be the temples of God, and that Christ never commanded these temples, but ended that temple at Jerusalem which God had com∣manded.</Q> While I was speaking, the priest got away: and afterwards the people made as if they feared we would take their purses, or steal their horses; judging us like them∣selves, who are naturally given to thieving.</P>
<P>The next day we came into Cumberland again, where we had a general meeting of thousands of people atop of an hill near Langlands. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was; for the glory of the Lord did shine over all; and there were as many as one could well speak over the multitude was so great. Their eyes were turned to Christ their teacher; and they came to sit under their own vine; insomuch that Francis Howgill, coming afterwards to visit them, sound they had no need of words; for they were sitting under their teacher Christ Jesus; in the sense whereof he sat down amongst them, without speaking any thing. A great con∣vincement there was in Cumberland, Bishoprick, Northum∣berland. Westmoreland, Lancashire, and Yorkshire; and the plants of God grew and flourished, the heavenly rain de∣scending. and God's glory shining upon them: many mouths were opened by the Lord to his praise; yea, to babes and sucklings he ordained strength.</P>
<P>After my release from Carlisle prison, I was moved to go to priest Wilkinson's steeple-house again: and being got in before him, when he came, I was declaring the truth to the people, though they were but few; for the most and best of his hearers were turned to Christ's free teaching; and we had a meeting of friends hard-by, where Thomas Stubbs was declaring the word of life amongst them. As soon as the priest came in he opposed me: and there we staid most part of the day: for when I began, he opposed me so if any law was broken, he broke it. When his people would be haling me out, I manifested his fruits to be such as Christ spake of, when he said. <Q>They shall hale you out of
<PB N="148" REF="037441_0225_100D8F2DCB618360"/>their synagogues:</Q> and then he would be ashamed, and they would let me alone. There did he stand, till it was almost night, jangling, and opposing me; and would not go to his dinner, for he thought to have wearied me out. But at last the Lord's power and truth came so over him, that he packed away with his people. When he was gone, I went to the meeting of friends, who were turned to the Lord, and established by his power upon Christ, the rock and foundation of the true prophets and apostles.</P>
<P>About this time the priests and professors fell to prophe∣sying against us afresh. They had said long before, That we should be destroyed within a month; after that, they prolonged the time to half a year: but that time being long expired, and we mightily increased in number, they now gave out, That we would eat out one another. For after meetings, many tender people, having a great way to go, tarried at friends houses by the way, and sometimes more than there were beds to lodge in; so that some have lain on the hay-mows: hereupon fear possessed the professors and world's people. For they were afraid, that when we had eaten one another out, we would all come to be maintained by the parishes, and be chargeable to them. But after awhile, when they saw that the Lord blessed and increased friends, as he did Abraham, both in the field and in the basket, at their goings forth and comings in, at their risings up and lyings down, and that all things prospered with them; then they saw the falsehood of all their prophecies against us; and that it was in vain to curse where God had blessed. At the first convincement, when friends could not put off their hats to people, nor say You to a single person, but Thou and Thee, or could not bow, nor use flattering words in salutations, nor go into the fashions and customs of the world; many friends, that were tradesmen, lost their customers; for the people were shy of them, and would not trade with them; so that for a time some could hardly get money enough to buy bread. But afterwards, when people came to have experience of friends honesty and faithfulness and found that their Yea was Yea, and their Nay was Nay; that they kept to a word in their dealings, and that they would not cozen and cheat them; but that if they sent a child to their shops for any thing, they were as well used as if they had come themselves; the lives and conversations of friends did preach, and reached to the witness of God in the people. Then things altered so, that all the inquiry
<PB N="149" REF="037441_0226_100D8F3094E3B3B8"/>was. <Q>Where was a draper, or shopkeeper, or taylor, or shoemaker, or any other tradesman, that was a Quaker?</Q> Insomuch that friends had more business than many of their neighbours; and if there was any trading, they had a great part of it. Then the envious professors altered their note, and began to cry out. 'If we let these Quakers' one, they 'will take the trade of the nation out of our hands.' This hath been the Lord's doings to and for his people! which my desire is, that all who profess his holy truth may be truly kept sensible of; and that all may be preserved in and by his power and Spirit, faithful to God and man: first to God, in obeying him in all things; and then in doing unto all men that which is just and righteous, in all things that they have to do or deal with them in: that the Lord God may be glorified in their practising truth, holiness, godli∣ness, and righteousness amongst people, in their lives and conversations.</P>
<P>Friends being grown very numerous in the northern parts of this nation, and divers young convinced ones com∣ing daily in among us, I was moved of the Lord to write the following epistle, and send it amongst them, for the slitting up the pure mind, and raising an holy care and watchfulness in them over themselves, and one another, for the honour of truth.</P>

<P>IN the measure of the life of God wait for wisdom from God, from whom it comes. And all ye, who are chil∣dren of God, wait for the living food from the living God, to be nourished up to eternal life, from the one fountain from whence life comes; that in order ye may all be guided and walk: servants in your places, young men and young women in your places, and rulers of families; that every one, in your respective places, may adorn the truth in the measure of it. With it let your minds be kept up to the Lord Jesus, from whence it doth come; that a sweet sa∣vour ye may be to God, and in wisdom ye may all be ordered and ruled: that a crown and a glory ye may be one to another in the Lord. And that no strife, bitter∣ness, nor self-will may appear amongst you; but with the Light in which the unity is, all that may be condemned. And that every one in particular may see to and take care of the ordering and ruling of their own family; that in
<PB N="150" REF="037441_0227_100D8F3227A2CE08"/>righteousness and wisdom it may be governed, the fear and dread of the Lord set in every one's heart, that the secrets of the Lord every one may come to receive, that stewards of his grace you may come to be, to dispense it to every one as they have need; and so in favouring and right-discerning you may all be kept: that nothing con∣trary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e pure life of God may be brought forth in you, or among you, but all that is contrary to it, may by it be judged; that in light, in life and love ye may all live: and all that is contrary to the light, life, and love, may be brought to judgment, and by that light be condemned. And that no fruitless trees be among you; but all out down, condemned by the light, and cast into the fire; that every one may bear and bring forth fruit to God, and grow fruitful in his knowledge and in his wisdom; and that none may appear in words, beyond what they are in the life that gave forth the words. Here none shall be as the untimely figs; none shall be of those trees whose fruit withers: such go in Cain's way, from the light; and by it are condemned. Let none of you boast yourselves above your measure; if you do, out of God's kingdom you are excluded: for in that boasting part gets up the pride and the strife which is contrary to the light that leads to the kingdom of God, gives an entrance thereinto, and an understanding to know the things that belong to the kingdom. There the light and life of man every one receives; him who was before the world was, by whom it was made; who is the righteousness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, and his wis∣dom: to whom all glory, honour, thanks, and praise belongs, who is God blessed for ever. Let no image nor likeness be made; but wait in the light, which will bring condemnation on that part which would make images; for that prisons the just. To the lust yield not the eye, nor the flesh; for the pride of life stands in that which keeps out the love of the Father; and upon which his judgments and wrath remain, where the love of the world is sought after, and a crown that is mortal. In this ground the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il enters, which is cursed; which brings forth briers and thorus, where death reigns, and tribula∣tion and anguish are upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soul, and the Egyptian tongue is heard: all which is by the light condemned.

<P>While friends abode in the northern parts, a priest of Wrexham in Wales, named Morgan Floyd, having heard reports concerning us, sent two of his congregation into the north to inquire concerning us, to try us, and bring him an account of us. When these triers came amongst us, the power of the Lord seized on them, and they were both convinced of the truth. So they staid some time with us, and then returned to Wales; where afterwards one of them departed from his convincement; but the other named John-ap-John, abode in the truth, and received a part of the ministry, in which he continued faithful.</P>
<P>Now were the priests greatly disturbed at Newcastle, Kendal, and in most of the northern counties. There be∣ing one Gilpin, who had sometimes come amongst us at Kendal, and soon ran out from the truth into vain imagi∣nations; they made what evil use they could of him against us; but the Lord's power confounded them all. And the Lord God cut off two of those persecuting justices at Car∣lisle; and the other, after a time, was turned out of his place, and left the town.</P>
<P>About this time the oath or engagement to O. Cromwel was tendered to the soldiers; many of whom were disband∣ed, because in obedience to Christ, they could not swear: John Stubbs, for one, who was convinced when I was in Carlisle prison, became a good soldier in the Lamb's war, and a faithful minister of Christ Jesus; travelling much in the service of the Lord in Holland, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Egypt, and America. And the Lord's power pre∣served him out of the hands of the papists, though many times he was in great danger of the inquisition. But some of the soldiers, who had been convinced in their judgment, but had not come into obedience to the truth, took O. Cromwel's oath; and, going afterwards into Scotland, and coming before a garrison there, the garrison thinking they
<PB N="152" REF="037441_0229_100D8F3668D46480"/>had been enemies, sired at them, and killed divers of them; which was a sad event.</P>
<P>When the churches were settled in the north, and friends were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t down under Christ's teaching, and the glory of the Lord shined over them, I passed from Swarthmore to Lancaster about the beginning of the year 1654, visiting friends, till I came to Synder hill-green, where a meeting was appointed three weeks before; leaving the north fresh and green, under Christ their teacher. We passed through Halisax, a rude town of professors, and came to Thomas Taylor's, who had been a captain, where we met with some janglers: but the Lord's power was over all; for I travel∣led in the motion of God's power. When I came to Synde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-hill-green, there was a mighty meeting; some thou∣sands of people, as it was judged, and many persons of note were there, captains, and other officers; and there was a general convincement; for the Lord's power and truth was set over all, and there was no opposition.</P>
<P>About this time did the Lord move upon the spirits of many whom he had raised up, and sent forth to labour in his vineyard, to travel southwards, and spread themselves in the service of the gospel to the eastern, southern, and western parts of the nation: Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough to London; John Camin and John Audland to Bristol; Richard Hubberthorn and George Whitehead to∣wards Norwich; Thomas Holmes into Wales, and many others different ways: for above sixty ministers had the Lord raised up, and did now send abroad out of the north country. The sense of their service being very weighty upon me, I was moved to give forth the following paper:</P>

Where it is head, and hath bruised the head of the other, to the beginning you are come; and the younger is known, and he that is servant to the younger; and the promise of God, which is to the Seed, is fulfilled and fulfilling; and the scriptures come to be opened and owned; and the flesh of Christ

Christ takes upon him the seed of Abraham, and is a priest after the order of Melchisedeck; without father, without mother, without beginning of days or end of life: this is the priest that ever lives; the cove∣nant of life, light, and peace. The everlasting offering here is known once for all, which offering overthrows that nature which offered; out of which the priesthood arose, that could not continue by reason of death. And here is the other offering known, the everlasting offering; which perfects for ever them that are sanctified: which offering blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, triumphs over them, and ascends above all principalities and powers. He that hath the Spirit of Jesus, sees this; and here is the love of God received, that doth not rejoice in iniqui∣ty, but leads to repent of it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, friends every where scattered abroad, Know the power of God in one another, and in that re∣joice; for then you rejoice in the cross of Christ, who is not of the world; which cross is the power of God to all them that are saved. You, that know and feel the power, you feel the cross of Christ, you feel the gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believ∣eth. He that believes in the light, believes in the ever∣lasting covenant, in the one offering, comes to the life of the prophets and Moses, comes to see Christ the hope, the mystery, which hope perisheth not; lets you see the hope that perisheth, which is not that mystery: and the expecta∣tion in that perishing hope fades. Where this never-failing hope is witnessed, the Lord comes to be sanctified in the heart, and you come to the beginning, to Christ the hope, which perisheth not; but the other hope, the other expect∣ation perisheth. So all of you, know the perishing of the other, and the failing of the expectation therein; and know that which perisheth not: that you may be ready to give a reason of this hope with meekness and fear, to every man that asketh you. Christ the hope, the mystery, perisheth not; the end of all perishing things, the end of all changeable things, the end of the decaying covenant, the end of that which waxeth old; the end of the first co∣venant, of Moses, and of the prophets; the righteousness of God. Christ Jesus the Son: his throne ye will know, heirs with him ye will be; who makes his children kings
<PB N="154" REF="037441_0231_100D8F3A6A6BF858"/>and priests to him, and brings them to know his throne, and his power. There is no justification out of the light, out of Christ; justification is in the light, in Christ. Here is the doer of the will of God; here is the entering into the kingdom. He that believes in the light, becomes a child of light; and here the wisdom is received, that is justified of her children. Here believing in the light, you shall not abide in darkness; but shall have the light of life; and come every one to witness the light that shines in your hearts, which will give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je∣sus Christ. With this light you will see him reign, who is the prince of life and peace; which light turns from him that is out of the truth, and abode not in it; where the true peace is not.</P>
<P>Friends. Be not hasty: for he that believes in the light, makes not haste. Here the grace is received, by which you come to be saved; the election is known, which ob∣tains the promise; the will is seen, that wills; the mind is known. that runs, which obtains not; but stops and dulls. Now, that with the light being seen, and judged, and stopped, the patience is here known, which obtains the crown; and the immortality is brought to light. So all who act contrary to the light, and do not believe in it, do not come to justification. And all friends, if you go from the light, from wanting to have the promise of God fulfilled to the Seed, whereby you may know Christ reign, you thereby bring on yourselves changeable garments, and come to wear the changeable garments, and the strange flesh, which leads to adultery, which the law goes upon; which shuts out of the kingdom: and out of this will doth proceed the work or building that is for the fire; whereby you may come to suffer loss. Therefore love the light, which doth condemn that; and receive the power from the Lord, with which you stand over that, and condemn it; feeling and seeing that which gives you victory over the world, and to see out of time, to before time. Again, friends, Know Abraham, that must obey the voice of Sa∣rah, that bears seed; which casts forth the bond-woman and her son. Do not go forth, there will the wildness lodge. Know that which bears the wild son, and its mo∣ther, who is not Sarah; for the promise is to the Seed, not of many, but one; which seed is Christ: and this seed now you come to witness stands on the top of all,
<PB N="155" REF="037441_0232_100D8F3C00C5C4E8"/>yea, on the head of the serpent. And so all, as I said before, who come to feel and witness this, come to the beginning: and this to all the seed of God, the church, that it you may all come to know, where there is no ble∣mish, nor spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing. This is that which is purchased by the blood of Jesus, and to the Father presented out of all that defiles; which is the pillar and ground of truth. None attain to this, but such who come to the light of Christ, who purchased this church. They who go from the light, are shut out and condemned, though they profess all the scriptures declared from it. Therefore walk in the light, that you may have fellowship with the Son, and with the Father; and come all to wit∣ness his image, his power, and his law, which is his light, that hath converted your souls, and brought them to sub∣mit to the higher power, above that which is out of the truth: that you may know here the mercy and truth, and the faith that works by love, which Christ is the author of; who lighteth every one of you: which faith gives the victory. That which gives the victory, is perfect; and that which the ministers of God received from God, is that which is perfect; and that which they are to minister, is for the perfecting of the saints; till they all come in the unity of the faith unto a perfect man. This is the word of the Lord to you all: Every one in the measure of life wait. that with it all your minds may be guided up to the Father of life, the Father of spirits: to receive power from him, and wisdom, that with it you may be ordered to his glory: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whom be all glory for ever! All keep in the light and life, that judgeth down that which is contrary to the light and life. So the Lord God Almighty be with you all. And keep your meetings every-where, being guided by that of God; by that you may see the Lord among you, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; that men who are come into the world might be∣lieve. He that believeth not, the light condemns him he that believeth, cometh out of condemnation. This light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, which they that hate it stumble at, is the light of men.</P>
<P>All friends that speak in publick, see that it be in the life of God; for that begets to God; the fruits of that shall never wither. This sows to the Spirit which is in prison, and of the Spirit reaps life; and the other sows to the
<PB N="156" REF="037441_0233_100D8F3EAF1AC6E0"/>flesh, and of the flesh reaps corruption. This you may see all the world over amongst these seeds-men, what may be reaped in the field, that is the world. Therefore in the Spirit of the Lord wait, which cuts down and casts out all this, the root and branches of it. So in that wait to receive power, and the Lord God Almighty preserve you in it; whereby you may come to seel the light, that comprehends time and the world, and fathoms it: which, believed in, gives you victory over the world. Here the power of the Lord is received, which subdues all the con∣trary, and puts off the garments that will stain and pol∣lute. With this light you come to reach the light in every man, which Christ enlightens every man that cometh into the world withal; and here the things of Christ come to be known, and the voice of Christ heard. Therefore keep in the light, the covenant of peace; and walk in the covenant of life. There is that which maketh merry over the witness of God, and there is that which maketh merry in the Lord; which rejoiceth over that which hath made merry over it: of that take notice, you who be in the light. Such the Lord doth beautify, whose trust is in his strength; and the Lord doth see such, and them that are in his light. But such as be from the light, whose eyes are after their abominations and idols, their eyes are to be blinded, their beautiful idols and their abominations to be destroyed, and by the light condemned, which they have made from the life in their own strength: which with the light is seen, and overthrown by the power of God. <Q>If you can change my covenant,</Q> faith the Lord, <Q>which keeps the day in its season, and the night in its season (mark, my covenant, the light) if you can change this, then may you change the covenant of God with his seed.</Q> So all friends that are turned to the light which cometh from him by whom the world was made, who was before it was made, Christ Jesus, the Saviour of your souls, abide in the light, and you will see your salvation to be walls and bulwarks against that which the light discovers to be contrary to it. Waiting in the light you will re∣ceive the power of God, which is the gospel of peace, that you may be shod with it. Know that in one another which raiseth up the seed of God, sets it over the world and the earth, and crucisies the affections and lusts: then the truth comes to reign, which is the guide.</P>

About this time Rice Jones of Nottingham (who had been a Baptist and was turned Ranter) and his company began to prophesy against me, giving out. That I was then at the highest, and after that time I should fall down as fast. He sent a bundle of railing papers from Nottingham to Mansfield, Clauson, and the towns thereabouts, judging friends for declaring the truth in the markets and in the steeple-houses; which papers I answered. But their pro∣phecies came upon themselves; for soon after they fell to pieces, and many of his followers became friends, and con∣tinued so. And through the Lord's blessed power truth and friends have increased, and do increase in the increase of God; and I by the same power have been and am pre∣served, and kept in the everlasting seed that never fell nor changes. But Rice Jones took the oaths that were put to him, and so disobeyed the command of Christ. Many such false prophets have risen up against me, but the Lord hath blasted them, and will blast all who rise against the blessed seed, and me in that. My confidence is in the Lord; for whosoever did, I saw their end, and how the Lord would confound them before he sent me forth.</P>
<P>I was now at Synder-hill-green, where I had a large meeting in the day-time, and another at night in Thomas Stacy's house; for the people came from far and could not soon depart. The high sheriff of the county told captain Bradford he intended to come up, with half a dozen of his troopers, to the meeting; but the Lord prevented him. When I had staid some meetings thereabouts, I travelled up and down in Yorkshire as far as Holderness, and to the Land's-end that way, visiting friends and the churches of Christ; which were sinely settled under his teaching. At length I reached captain Bradford's house, whither many Ranters came from York to wrangle; but they were con∣founded. Thither came she called the lady Montague; who was then convinced, and lived and died in the truth.</P>
<P>Then I went to Thomas Taylor's within three miles of Halifax, where was a meeting of about two hundred peo∣ple; amongst which were many rude persons, and divers butchers, who had bound themselves with an oath before they came out, that they would kill me (as I was told): one of those butchers had been accused for killing a man and a woman. They came in a very rude manner, and made a great disturbance in the meeting, which being in a close, Thomas Taylor stood up and said to them, <Q>If you
<PB N="158" REF="037441_0235_100D8F42E812F110"/>will be civil, you may stay; but if not, I charge you to be gone from off my ground.</Q> But they grew worse, and said they would make it like a common; and they yelled and made a noise as if they had been at a bear-baiting. They thrust friends up and down, who being peaceable, the Lord's power came over them. Several times they push'd me off from the place I stood on, by the crowding of the people together against me; but still I was moved of the Lord to stand up again as I was thrust down. At last I was moved of the Lord to say to them, <Q>If they would dis∣course of the things of God, let them come up to me one by one; and if they had any thing to object, I would an∣swer them all, one after another;</Q> but they were all silent, and had nothing to say: and then the Lord's power came so over them all, and answered the divine witness in them, that they were bound by the power of God, and a glorious powerful meeting we had, and the minds of the people were turned by the holy Spirit in them to God, and to Christ their teacher. The powerful word of life was largely declared that day, and in the life and power of God we broke up our meeting; and that rude company went their way to Halifax. The people asked them, <Q>Why they did not kill me, according to the oath they had sworn?</Q> They maliciously answered, <Q>I had so bewitched them they could not do it.</Q> Thus was the devil chained at that time. Friends told me, they used to come at other times and be very rude, and sometimes break their seats and make frightful work amongst them; but the Lord's power had now bound them. Shortly after, this butcher, that had been accused of killing a man and a woman be∣fore, and who was one of those that had bound himself by an oath to kill me, killed another man, and was thereupon sent to York gaol. Another of those rude butchers, who had also sworn to kill me, having accustomed himself to thrust his tongue out of his mouth in derision of friends when they passed by him, had his tongue so swollen out of his month that he could never draw it in again, but died so. Several strange and sudden judgments came upon many of these conspirators against me, which would be too large to declare here. God's vengeance from heaven came upon the blood-thirsty, who soughe after blood; for all such spi∣rits I laid before the Lord, and left him to deal with them, who is stronger than all, in whose power I was pre∣served and carried on to do his work. The Lord hath
<PB N="159" REF="037441_0236_100D8F455F0FC070"/>raised a fine people in those parts, whom he hath drawn to Christ, and gathered in his name; who feel Christ amongst them, and sit under his teaching.</P>
<P>After this I came to Balby; from whence several friends accompanied me into Lincolnshire, of whom some went to the steeple-house, and some to private meetings. There came to the meeting where I was, the sheriff of Lincoln, and several with him; who made great contention and jan∣gling for a time: but at length the Lord's power struck him, that he was convinced of the truth, and received the word of life, as did several others also who had opposed, and continued amongst friends till they died. Great meetings there were, and a large convincement in those parts. Many were turned to the Lord Jesus, and came to sit under his teaching, leaving their priests and their superstitious ways; and the day of the Lord flourished over all amongst them that came to our meetings in that country. One called Sir Richard Wrey was convinced; also his brother and his brother's wife, who abode in the truth and died therein; though he afterwards ran out.</P>
<P>Having visited those countries, I came into Derbyshire; the sheriff of Lincoln, who was lately convinced, being with me. In one meeting we had some opposition; but the Lord's glorious power gave dominion over all. At night came a company of bailiffs and serving-men, and called me out. I went out to them, having some friends with me. They were exceeding rude and violent; for they had, it seems, plotted together, and intended to have carri∣ed me away with them in the dark of the evening by force, to have done me a mischief; but the Lord's power chained them, so that they could not effect their design; and at last they went away. The next day Thomas Aldam, under∣standing the serving-men belonged to a knight, who lived not far off, went to his house and laid before him the bad carriage of his servants. The knight rebuked them, and did not allow of their evil behaviour towards us.</P>
<P>After this we came to Skegby, in Nottinghamshire, where we had a great meeting of divers sorts; and the Lord's power went over them, and all was quiet. The people were turned to the Spirit of God, by which many came to receive his power, and to sit under the teaching of Christ, their Saviour. A great people the Lord hath in those parts.</P>
<P>I passed towards Kidsley-park, where came many Rant∣ers;
<PB N="160" REF="037441_0237_100D8F47D7EC09E8"/>but the Lord's power check'd them. From thence I went into the Peak-country to Thomas Hammersley's where came the Ranters of that country, and many high professors. The Ranters opposed me, and fell a swearing. When I reproved them for swearing, they would bring scripture for it, alledging Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph swore; and the priests, Moses, the prophets, and the angels swore. <Q>I confessed all these did so, as the scripture re∣cords; but said I. Christ (who said, Before Abraham was I am) commanded, Swear not at all. Christ ends the prophets, the old priesthood, the dispensation of Moses, and reigns over the house of Jacob and Joseph; and he says, Swear not at all. And God, when he bringeth the first-begotten into the world, saith, Let all the angels of God worship him, to wit, Christ Jesus, who saith. Swear not at all. As for the plea that men make for swearing to end their strife, Christ, who says. Swear not at all, de∣stroys the devil and his works, who is the author of strife; for that is one of his works. And God said, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</Q> So the Son is to be heard who forbids swearing. And the apostle James, who did hear the Son of God, followed him, and preached him, forbids all oaths, James v. 12.</Q> So the Lord's power went over them: and his Son and his doctrine was set over them. The word of life was fully and richly preached, and many were convinced that day. This Thomas Hammersly being summoned to serve upon a jury, was admitted to serve without an oath; and being foreman of the jury, when he brought in the verdict, the judge declared, <Q>That he had been a judge so many years, but never heard a more upright verdict than that Quaker had then brought in.</Q> Much might be written of things of this nature, which time would fail to declare. But the Lord's blessed power and truth was exalted over all, who is worthy of all praise and glory for ever!</P>
<P>Travelling through Derbyshire. I visited friends till I came to Swanington, in Leicestershire, where was a general meeting, to which many Ranters, Baptists, and other pro∣fessors came: for great contests there had been with them, and with the priests in that town. To this meeting several friends came from divers parts; John Audland. Francis Howgill, Edward Pyot from Bristol, and Edward Burrough from London; and several were convinced in those parts.
<PB N="161" REF="037441_0238_100D8F49F7276280"/>The Ranters made a disturbance, and were very rude; but at last the Lord's power came over them, and they were confounded. The next day Jacob Bottomly, a great Ranter, came from Leicester; but the Lord's power stopt him, and came over them all. There came a priest too; but he also was confounded by the mighty power of the Lord. About this time the priests, Baptists, Ranters, and other professors were very rude, and stirred up rude peo∣ple against us. We sent to the Ranters to come forth, and try their god. Abundance of them came, who sung, whis∣tled, and danced; but the Lord's power so prevailed over them that many of them were convinced.</P>
<P>After this I went to Twycross, whither came some Rant∣ers, who sung and danced before me; but I was moved in the dread of the Lord to reprove them: and the Lord's power came over them, so that some of them were convin∣ced, and received the Spirit of God; who are become a pretty people, living and walking soberly in the truth of Christ. I went to Anthony Brickley's, in Warwickshire, where there was a great meeting; several Baptists and others came and jangled: but the Lord's power came over them.</P>
<P>Then I went to Drayton, in Leicestershire, to visit my relations. As soon as I was come in, Nathaniel Stephens, the priest, having got another priest, and given notice to the country, sent to me to come to them; for they could not do any thing till I came. I, having been three years away from my relations, knew nothing of their design. But at last I went into the steeple-house yard, where the two priests were; and they had gathered abundance of people. They would have had me gone into the steeple-house. I asked them, what I should do there? They said, Mr. Stephens could not bear the cold. I told them, he might bear it as well as I. At last we went into a great hall, Richard Farnsworth being with me; and a great dispute we had with these priests concerning their practice, how contraty they were to Christ and his apostles. The priests would know where tithes were forbidden or ended. I shewed them out of the seventh chapter to the Hebrews, <Q>That not only tithes, but the priesthood that took tithes, was ended; and the law was ended and disan∣nulled by which the priesthood was made, and tithes were commanded to be paid.</Q> Then they stirred up the people to some lightness and rudeness. I had known Stephens from a child, therefore I laid open his condition and the
<PB N="162" REF="037441_0239_100D8F4B8D030630"/>manner of his preaching: <Q>and how he, like the rest of the priests, did apply the promises to the first birth which must die. But I shewed that the promises were to the seed, not to many seeds, but to the one seed, Christ; who was one in male and female: for all were to be born again, before they could enter into the kingdom of God.</Q> Then he said, I must not judge so. I told him, <Q>He that was spiritual judged all things.</Q> Then he confessed, That was a full scripture; But, neighbours, said he, this is the busi∣ness; GEORGE FOX is come to the light of the sun, and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he thinks to put out my star-light. I told him, <Q>I would not quench the least measure of God in any, much less put out his star-light, if it were true light from the morning-star. But I told him, if he had any thing from Christ, he ought to speak it freely, and not take tither from the people for preaching; seeing Christ commanded his ministers to give freely, as they had received freely.</Q> So I charged him to preach no more for tithes or any hire. But he said, he would not yield-to that. After awhile the people began to be vain and rude, whereupon we broke up; yet some were made loving to the truth that day. Be∣fore we parted, I told them. <Q>If the Lord would, I intend∣ed to be at the town again that day seven-night.</Q> In the interim I went into the country, had meetings, and came again that day seven-night. Against that time this priest had got seven priests to help him; for he had given notice at a lecture on a market-day at Adderston, that such a day there would be a meeting and a dispute with me. I knew nothing of it; but only had said I should be in town that day seven-night again. These eight priests had gathered several hundreds of people, even most of the country there∣abouts, and would have had me into the steeple-house. I refused to go in, and got on a hill, and there spoke to them and the people. Thomas Taylor, James Parnel, and se∣veral other friends were with me. The priests thought that day to have trampled down truth; but the truth came over them. Then they grew light and the people rude. The priests would not stand trial with me; but would be con∣tending here and there a little with one friend or other. At last one of the priests brought his son to dispute with me; but his mouth was soon stopt. When he could not tell how to answer, he would ask his father, and his father was confounded also when he came to answer for his son. So after they had toiled themselves, they went in a rage to
<PB N="163" REF="037441_0240_100D8F4DBA1867F0"/>priest Stephens's house to drink. As they went away I said, <Q>I never came to a place where so many priests toge∣ther would not stand the trial with me.</Q> Whereupon they and some of their wives came about me, laid hold of me, and fawningly said, <Q>What might I have been, if it had not been for the Quakers?</Q> Then they fell a pushing of friends to and fro, to thrust them from me, and to pluck me to themselves. After awhile several lusty fellows came, took me up in their arms, and carried me into the steeple-house porch, intending to have carried me into the steeple-house by force; but the door being locked, they fell down on an heap, having me under them. As soon as I could I got from them to my hill again: then they got me from that place, took me to the steeple-house wall, and set me on a bass like a stool; and all the priests, being come back, stood under with the people. The priess cried, Come, to argument, to argument. I said, <Q>I denied all their voices, for they were the voices of hirelings and strangers.</Q> They cried, Prove it, prove it. I directed them to the tenth of John, where they might see what Christ said of such; he declared, <Q>He was the true Shepherd that laid down his life for his sheep, and his sheep heard his voice and fol∣lowed him; but the hireling would fly when the wolf came, because he was an hireling.</Q> I offered to prove that they were such hirelings. Then the priests plucked me off from the bass again, and themselves got all upon basses under the steeple-house wall. Then I felt the mighty power of God arise over all, and told them, <Q>If they would give audience, and hear me quietly, I would shew them by the scriptures why I denied those eight priests or teachers that stood before me, and all the hireling teachers of the world whatsoever, and I would give them scriptures for what I said.</Q> Whereupon both priests and people consented. Then I shewed them out of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Fzeksel, Micah, Malachi, and other prophets, that they were in the steps of such as God sent his true prophets to cry against; for, said I. <Q>You are such as the prophet Jere∣miah cried against, chap. v. when he said, <Q>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means;</Q> which he called an horrible filthy thing. You are such as used their tongues, and said. Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord never spoke to them. Such as followed their own spirits, and saw nothing; but spoke a divination of their own brain: and by their lies and their lightness
<PB N="164" REF="037441_0241_100D8F50328D77A0"/>caused the people to err, Jer. xiv. You are such as they were that sought their gain from their quarter; that were as greedy dumb dogs, that could never have enough, whom the Lord sent his prophet Isaiah to cry against, Isa. lvi. You are such as they were who taught for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, who sewed pillows under people's arm-holes, that they might lie soft in their sins. Ezek. xiii. You are such as they that taught for the fleece and the wool, and made a prey of the people, Ezek. xxxiv. But the Lord is gathering his sheep from your mouths, and from your barren mountain; and is bringing them to Christ, the one shepherd, whom he hath set over his flocks; as by his prophet Ezekiel he then declared he would do. You are such as those that divined for money, and preached for hire; and if a man did not put into their, mouths they prepared war against him, as the prophet Micah complained, chap. iii.</Q> Thus I went through the prophets too largely to be here repeated. Then coming to the New Testament, I shewed from thence, that <Q>that they were like the chief priests, scribes, and pharisees, whom Christ cried wo against, Matth. xxiii. And that they were such false apostles as the true apostles cried against, such as taught for filthy lucre; such antichrists and de∣ceivers as they cried against, that minded earthly things, and served not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bel∣lies: for they that served Christ gave freely and preached freely, as he commanded them. But they that will not preach without hire, tithes, or outward means, serve their own bellies, and not Christ; and through the good words of the scriptures, and feigned words of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, they made merchandize of the people then, as (said I) ye do now. When I had largely quoted the scriptures, and shewed them wherein they were like the pharisees, loving to be called of men masters, to go in long robes, to stand praying in the synagogues, to have the uppermost rooms at feasts and the like; and when I had thrown them out in the sight to the people amongst the false prophets, de∣ceivers, scribes, and pharisees, and shewed at large how such as they were judged and condemned by the true prophets, Christ, and the aposstles, I directed them to the light of Jesus, who enlightens every man that cometh into the world; that by it they might see whether these things were not true as had been spoken.</Q> When I appealed to that of God in their consciences, the light of Christ Jesus
<PB N="165" REF="037441_0242_100D8F52C2BD85D8"/>in them, they could not abide to hear it; they were all quiet till then; but then a professor said, George, what! wilt thou never have done? I told him, I should have done shortly. I went on a little longer, and cleared myself of them in the Lord's power. When I had done, all the priests and people stood silent for a time; at last one of the priests said, They would read the scriptures that. I had quoted. I told them, with all my heart. They began to read the twenty-third of Jeremiah, where they saw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rks of the false prophets that he cried against. When the had read a verse or two, I said, Take notice, people; but the priests said, Hold thy tongue, George. I bid them read the whole chapter throughout. for it was all against them. Then they stopt, and would read no further; but asked me a question. I told them I would answer their question the matter being first granted that I had charged them with, viz that they were false prophets, false teachers, antichrists, and deceivers, such as the true prophets, Christ, and the apostles cried against. A professor said Nay to that; but I said, <Q>Yea: for you leaving the matter, and going to another thing, seem to consent to the proof of the former charge.</Q> Then I answered their question, which was this; <Q>Seeing those false prophets were adulte∣rated, Whether I did judge priest Stephens to be an adulterer?</Q> To which I answered, <Q>He was adulterated from God in his practice, like those false prophets and the Jews.</Q> They would not stand to vindicate him, but broke up the meeting. Then the priests whispered together; and Stephens came to me, and desired that my father, brother, and I might go aside with him, that he might speak to me in private, and the rest of the priests should keep the peo∣ple from coming to us. I was very loth to go aside with him; but the people cried, <Q>Go, George; do, George, go aside with him.</Q> Being afraid, if I did not go, they would say I was disobedient to my parents, I went, and the rest of the priests were to keep the people off; but they could not, for the people, being willing to hear, drew close to us. I asked the priest, what he had to say? He said, <Q>If he was out of the way I should pray for him, and if I was out of the way he would pray for me; and he would give me a form of words to pray for him by?</Q> I replied, <Q>It seems thou dost not know whether thou beest in the right way or no; neither dost thou know whether I am in the right way or no; but I know that I am in the ever∣lasting
<PB N="166" REF="037441_0243_100D8F54561682B0"/>way. Christ Jesus, which thou art out of. Thou wouldst give me a form of words to pray by yet thou de∣niest the Common Prayer Book to pray by as well as I, and I deny thy form of words as well as it. If thou wouldst have me pray for thee by a form of words, is not this to deny the apostle's doctrine and practice of praying by the Spirit, as it gave words and utterance?</Q> Here the people fell a laughing; but I was moved to speak more to him. And when I had cleared myself to him and them we parted, after I had told them, that I should, God willing, be in town that day seven-night again. So the priests pack'd away, and many people were convinced that day; for the Lord's power came over all. Many that were con∣vinced before, were by that day's work confirmed in the truth, and abode in it: and a great shake it gave to the priests. Yea, my father, though a hearer and follower of the priest, was so well satisfied, that he struck his cane up∣on the ground, and said, <Q>Truly I see, he that will but stand to the truth, it will bear him out.</Q> I passed about in the country till that day seven-night, and then came a∣gain: for we had appointed a meeting at my relations house. Priest Stephens, having notice beforehand thereof, had got another priest to him. They had a company of troopers with them; and sent for me to come to them. But I sent them word, our meeting was appointed, and they might come to it if they would. The priests came not; but the troopers came, and many rude people. They had laid their plot, That the troopers should take every one's name, and then command them to go home; and such as would not go, they should take, and carry away with them. Accord∣ingly they began, and took several names, charging them to go home; but when they came to take my name, my rela∣tions told them I was at home already: so they could not take me away that time. Nevertheless they took my name; but the Lord's power was over them, and they went away, both professors and troopers, crossed and vexed because they had not their ends. But several were convinced that day, and admired the love and power of God. This was that priest Stephens, who once said of me, <Q>Never such a plant was bred in England:</Q> yet afterwards he reported, <Q>That I was carried up into the clouds, and found again full of gold and silver;</Q> and many false reports he raised on me, but the Lord swept them all away. The reason why I would not go into their steeple-house was, because I
<PB N="167" REF="037441_0244_100D8F55F14E21A0"/>was to bear my testimony against it, and to bring all off from such places to the Spirit of God; that they might know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Ghost; and to bring them off from all the hireling teachers to Christ, their free teacher, who died for them, and purchased them with his blood.</P>
<P>After this I went into the country, had several meet∣ings, and came to Swanington, where the soldiers came; but the meeting was quiet, the Lord's power was over all, and the soldiers did not meddle. Then I went to Lei∣cester, and from Leicester to Whetstone. There came about seventeen troopers of colonel Hacker's regiment, with his marshal, and took me up before the meeting, though friends were beginning to gather together; for there were several friends from divers parts. I told the marshal, <Q>He might let all the friends go, I would answer for them all.</Q> Whereupon he took me, and let all the friends go; only Alexander Parker went along with me. At night they had me before colonel Hacker, his major, and captains, a great company of them; and a great deal of discourse we had about the priests, and about meetings; for at this time there was a noise of a plot against O. Cromwel. Much reason∣ing I had with them about the light of Christ, which en∣lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. Col. Hacker asked, Whether it was not this light of Christ that made Judas betray his master, and after led him to hang himself? I told him, <Q>No: that was the spirit of dark∣ness, which hated Christ and his light.</Q> Then col. Hacker said, I might go home, and keep at home; and not go abroad to meetings. I told him, <Q>I was an innocent man, free from plots, and denied all such work.</Q> His son Need∣ham said, <Q>Father, this man hath reigned too long; it is time to have him cut off.</Q> I asked him, <Q>For what? What had I done? or whom had I wronged from a child? for I was bred and born in that country, and who could accuse me of any evil from a child?</Q> Col. Hacker asked me again, If I would go home, and stay at home? I told him, <Q>If I should promise him so, it would manifest that I was guilty of something, to make my home a prison: and if I went to meetings, they would say I broke their order. Therefore I told them, I should go to meetings, as the Lord should order me; and could not submit to their requirings: but I said, we were a peaceable people.</Q> 'Well then,' said colonel Hacker, <Q>I will send you to∣morrow
<PB N="168" REF="037441_0245_100D8F597B479150"/>morning by six o'clock to my lord protector, by captain Drury, one of his life-guard.</Q> That night I was kept prisoner at the Marshalsea; and the next morning by the sixth hour I was delivered to captain Drury. I desired he would let me speak with colonel Hacker before I went; and he had me to his bed-side. Colonel Hacker set upon me presently again to go home, and keep no more meetings. I told him, <Q>I could not submit to that; but must have my liberty to serve God, and to go to meetings.</Q> 'Then,' said he, 'you must go before the protector.' Whereupon <Q>I kneeled on his bed-side, and besought the Lord to for∣give him; for he was as Pilate, though he would wash his hands; and when the day of his misery and trial should come upon him, I bid him, Then remember what I had said to him.</Q> But he was stirred up and set on by Ste∣phens, and the other priests and professors, wherein their envy and baseness was manifest; who, when they could not overcome me by disputes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arguments, not resist the Spi∣rit of the Lord that was in me, they got soldiers to take me up.</P>
<P>Afterwards, when colonel Hacker was imprisoned in Lon∣don, a day or two before his execution, he was, put in mind of what he had done against the innocent; and he remem∣bered it, and confessed it to Margaret Fell; saying, He knew well whom she meant; and he had trouble upon him for it. So his son, who had told, his father I had reigned too long, and it was time to have me cut off, might observe how his father was cut off afterwards, he being hanged at Tyburn.</P>
<P>I was carried up prisoner by captain Drury from Leices∣ter; and when we came to Harborough, he asked me, If I would go home, and stay a fortnight? I should have my liberty, he said, if I would not go to nor keep meetings. I told him, I could not promise any such thing. Several times upon the road did he ask, and try me after the same manner; and still I gave him the same answers. So he brought me to London, and lodged me at the Mermaid over against the Mews at Charing-Cross. As we travelled, I was moved of the Lord to warn people at the inns and places, where I came, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them. William Dewsbury and Marmaduke Storr being in prison at Northampton, he let me go and visit them.</P>
<P>After captain Drury had lodged me at the Mermaid, he
<PB N="169" REF="037441_0246_100D8F5B86CA8680"/>went to give the protector an account of me. When he came to me again, he told me, The prorector required that I should promise not to take up a carnal sword or weapon against him or the government, as it then was; and that I should write it in what words I saw good, and set my hand to it. I said little in reply to captain Drury. But the next morning I was moved of the Lord to write a paper <Q>To the protector, by the name of Oliver Cromwel; wherein I did in the presence of the Lord God declare, that I did deny the wearing or drawing of a carnal sword, or any other outward weapon, against him or any man. And that I was sent of God to stand a witness a∣gainst all violence, and against the works of darkness; and to turn people from darkness to light; to bring them from the occasion of war and fighting to the peaceable gospel; and from being evil-doers, which the magistrates sword should be a terror to.</Q> Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I had written what the Lord had given me to write, I set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y name to it, and gave it to captain Drury to hand to O. Cromwel; which he did. Af∣ter some time captain Drury brought me before the protect∣or himself at Whitehall. It was in a morning, before he was dressed; and one Harvey, who had come a little among friends, but was disobedient, waited upon him. When I came in, I was moved to say, <Q>Peace be in this house: and I exhorted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o keep in the fear of God, that he might receive wisdom from him; that by it he might be ordered, and with it might order all things under his hand unto God's glory.</Q> I spoke much to him of truth; and a great deal of discourse I had with him about religion: wherein he carried himself very moderately. But he said, We quarrelled with the priests, whom he called ministers. I told him, <Q>I did not quarrel with them, they quarrelled with me and my friends. But, said I, if we own the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, we cannot hold up such teachers, prophets, and shepherds, as the prophets, Christ, and the apostles declared against; but we must declare against them by the same power and Spirit. Then I shewed him, That the prophets, Christ, and the apos∣tles declared freely, and declared against them that did not declare freely; such as preached for filthy lucre, divined for money, and preached for hire, and were covetous and greedy, like the dumb dogs that could never have enough: and that they, who have the same Spirit that Christ and the prophets, and the apostles had, could not but declare
<PB N="170" REF="037441_0247_100D8F5D1B303C50"/>against all such now, as they did then.</Q> As I spoke he several times said, It was very good, and it was truth. <Q>I told him, That all Christendom (so called) had the scrip∣tures but they wanted the power and Spirit that those had who gave forth the scriptures; and that was the reason they were not in fellowship with the Son, nor with the Father, nor with the scriptures, nor one with another.</Q> Many more words I had with him; but people coming in, I drew a little back. As I was turning, he catched me by the hand, and with tears in his eyes, said, Come again to <Q>my house; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we should be nearer one to the other;</Q> adding, That he wished me no more ill than he did to his own soul. I told him, <Q>If he did, he wronged his own soul; and ad∣monished him to hearken to God's voice, that he might stand in his counsel, and obey it; and if he did so, that would keep him from har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess of heart: but if he did not hear God's volce, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>art would be hardened.</Q> He said, It was true. Then I went out; and when captain Drury came out after me, he told me, His lord protector said, I was at liberty, and might go whither I would. Then I was brought into a great hall, where the protector's gentle∣men were to dine. I asked them, What they brought me thither for? They said, It was by the protector's order, that I might dine with them. I bid them let the protector know, I would not eat of his bread, nor drink of his drink. When he heard this, he said, <Q>Now I see there is a people risen, that I cannot win either with gifts, honours, offices or places; but all other sects and people I can.</Q> It was told him again, <Q>That we had forsook our own; and were not like to look for such things from him.</Q></P>
<P>Being set at liberty, I went to the inn where captain Drury at first lodged me. This captain, though he some∣times carried it fairly, was an enemy to me and to truth, and opposed it. When professors came to me, while I was under his custody, and he was by, he would scoff at trem∣bling, and call us Quakers, as the Independents and Pres∣byterians had nicknamed us before. But afterwards he came and told me, That, as he was lying on his bed to rest him∣self in the day-time, a sudden trembling seized on him, that his joints knocked together; and his body shook so that he could not rise from his bed: he was so shaken, that he had not strength enough left to rise. But he felt the power of the Lord was upon him; and he tumbled off his bed, and
<PB N="171" REF="037441_0248_100D8F5EC885EA50"/>cried to the Lord, and said, He would never speak against the Quakers more, such as trembled at the word of God.</P>
<P>During the time I was prisoner at Charing-Cross, there came abundance to see me, almost of all sorts, priests, pro∣fessors, officers of the army, &amp;c. Once a company of officers being with me, desired me to pray with them. I sat still, with my mind retired to the Lord. At last I felt the power and Spirit of God move in me; and the Lord's power did so shake and shatter them, that they wondered, though they did not live in it.</P>
<P>Among those that came was colonel Packer, with several of his officers. While they were with me, came in one Cob. and a great company of Ranters with him. The Ranters began to call for drink and tobacco; but I desired them to forbear it in my room, telling them, <Q>If they had such a mind to it, they might go into another room.</Q> One of them cried, 'All is ours:' and another of them said, 'All is well.' I replied, <Q>How is all well, while thou art so peevish, envious, and crabbed?</Q> for I saw he was of a peevish nature. I spake to their conditions, and they were sensible of it, and looked one upon another, won∣dering.</P>
<P>Then colonel Packer began to talk with a light, chaffy mind, concerning God, Christ, and the scriptures: it was a great grief to my soul and spirit, when I heard him talk so lightly; so that I told him, <Q>He was too light to talk of the things of God: for he did not know the solidity of a man.</Q> Thereupon the officers raged, and said, Would I say so of their colonel? Packer was a Baptist: he and the Ranters bowed and scraped to one another very much; for it was the manner of the Ranters to be exceeding compli∣mental, so that Packer bid them give over their compli∣ments; but I told them, <Q>They were fit to go together, for they were both of one spirit.</Q></P>
<P>This colonel lived at Theobalds near Waltham, and was made a justice of peace. He set up a great meeting of the Baptists at Theobalds Park; for he and some other officers had purchased it. They were exceeding high, railed against friends and truth; and threatened to apprehend me with their warrants, if ever I came there. Yet after I was set at liberty, I was moved of the Lord to go to Theobalds, and appoint a meeting hard-by them; to which many of his people came, and divers of his hearers were convinced of the way of truth, received Christ the free teacher, and
<PB N="172" REF="037441_0249_100D8F60C39E6828"/>came off from the Baptist; which made him rage the more. But the Lord's power came over him so, that he was not able to meddle with me. Then I went to Waltham, hard∣by him, and had a meeting there. The people were very rude, gathered about the house, and broke the windows. Whereupon I went out to them, with the bible in my hand, desired them to come in; and told them, <Q>I would shew them scripture both for our principles and practices.</Q> When I had done so, I shewed them also <Q>that their teach∣ers were in the steps of such as the prophets, Christ, and the apostles cried against. I directed them to the light of Christ, the Spirit of God in their own hearts; that by it they might come to know their free teacher, the Lord Jesus Christ.</Q> The meeting being ended, they went away quieted and satisfied; and a meeting hath since been settled in that town. But this was some time after I was set at liberty by O. Cromwel.</P>
<P>When I came from Whitehall to the Mermaid at Cha∣ring-Cross, I staid not long there: but went into the city of London, where we had great and powerful meetings; so great were the throngs of people, that I could hardly get to and from the meetings for the crowds; and the truth spread exceedingly. T. Aldam and R. Craven, who had been sheriffs of Lincoln, and divers friends, came up to London after me: but A. Parker abode with me.</P>
<P>After awhile I went to Whitehall again, and was moved to declare <Q>the day of the Lord amongst them; and that the Lord was come to teach his people himself:</Q> so I preached truth both to the officers, and to them that were called Oliver's gentlemen, who were of his guard. But a priest opposed, while I declared the word of the Lord amongst them: for Oliver had several about him, of which this was his news-monger; an envious priest, a light, scorn∣ful, chaffy man. I bid him repent; and he put it in his news-paper the next week, that I had been at Whitehall, and had bid a godly minister there repent. When I went thither again, I met with him; and abundance of people gathered about me. I manifested the priest to be a liar in several things that he had affirmed; and he was put to silence. He put in the news, that I wore silver buttons; which was false; for they were but ochimy. Afterwards he put in the news, that I hung ribands on people's arms, which made them follow me. This was another of his lies; for I never used nor wore ribands in my life. Three
<PB N="173" REF="037441_0250_100D8F63AE903A20"/>friends went to examine this priest, that gave forth this false intelligence; and to know of him where he had that infor∣mation? He said, It was a woman that told him so; and if they would come again, he would tell them the woman's name. When they came again, he said, It was a man, but would not tell them his name then; but if they would come again, he would tell them his name, and where he lived. They went the third time; and then he would not say who told him; but offered, if I would give it under my hand that there was no such thing, he would put that into the news. Thereupon the friends carried it to him under my hand; but when they came, he broke his promise, and would not put it in: but was in a rage, and threatened them with the constable. This was the deceitful doing of this forger of lies: and these lies he spread over the nation in the news, to render truth odious, and to put evil into people's minds against friends and truth: of which a more large account may be seen in a book printed soon after this time, for the clearing of friends and truth from the slanders and false reports raised and cast upon them. These priests, the news-mongers, were of the independent sect, like them in Leicester; but the Lord's power came over all their lies, and swept them away; and many came to see the naughti∣ness of these priests. The God of heaven earried me over all in his power, and his blessed power went over the na∣tion; insomuch that many friends about this time were moved to go up and down, to found forth the everlasting gospel in most parts of this nation, and also in Scotland; and the glory of the Lord was felt over all to his everlasting praise. A great convincement there was in London; some in the protector's house and family. I went to have seen him again, but could not get to him, the officers were grown so rude.</P>
<P>The Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists were greatly disturbed; for many of their people turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, sat down under his teachings, received his power, and felt it in their hearts; and then they were moved of the Lord to declare against the rest of them.</P>
<P>I appointed a meeting in the fields near Acton, in which the word of life, the saving truth was declared sreely. The Lord's power was eminently manifested, and his blessed day exalted over all.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write a paper, and send it among the professors, on this wise:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<OPENER><SALUTE>To all professors of Christianity:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL those that professed Jesus Christ in words, and yet heard him not when he was come, said, he was a deceiver and a devil. The chief priests called him so. The Jews said, <Q>He hath a devil and is mad; why do ye hear him?</Q> But others said, <Q>These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</Q> The Jews then doubted whether he was the Christ, or no. So all, like the Jews, in the knowledge, in the notion, that profess Christ without only, where he is risen within, do not own him, but doubt of him; though Christ be the same now and for ever. He said, <Q>I and my Father are one; then the Jews took up stones to stone him;</Q> and where Jesus Christ is now spi∣ritually come and made manifest, such as are christians in outward profession only, have the same hard hearts in∣wardly now as the Jews had then; and cast stones at him, where he is risen. Jesus said, <Q>For which of these good works do ye stone me?</Q> The Jews answered, <Q>For thy good works we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, in that thou being a man, makest thyself God.</Q> Jesus answered 'them, <Q>Is it not written in your law, I said you are gods? and the scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? The Jews said to him, Say we not well, that thou hast a devil? Jesus answered, I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. And they that were in the syna∣gogue rose up, and thrust him out of the city; and took him up to the edge of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong. The Pharisees said, He casteth out devils by the prince of devils.</Q> Christ was called a glutton and a wine-bibber; a friend of pub∣licans and sinners; but wisdom is justified of her children. The officers, when the high-priests and Pharisees asked them, "Why have ye not brought him?" said <Q>Never man spake like this man.</Q> The Pharisees said, <Q>Are you also deceived? Do any of the rulers or of the Pha∣risees believe on him? but this people, which know not the law, are accursed. Nicodemus said unto them (he that came unto Jesus by night) doth our law judge any man before it hear him?</Q> When Stephen confessed Je∣sus, the substance of all figures and types, and was
<PB N="175" REF="037441_0252_100D8F67AE9041F0"/>brought before the chief priests to his trial, he told them, <Q>The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</Q> and brought the prophets words to witness, and told them, They were stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, and always resisted the Holy Ghost, as their fathers had done. Stephen was full of the Holy Ghost, and said, He saw Jesus; and they ran upon him, and stoned him to death, as he was calling upon the Lord. When Paul confessed Jesus Christ, and his Resurrection, Festus said, He was mad. When Paul preached the resur∣rection, some mocked. The Jews persuaded the people, and they stoned him, and drew him out of the city, think∣ing he had been dead. The Jews stirred up the Gentiles, to make their minds evil-affected towards the brethren. The Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief of the city: and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts: and there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them. In like manner all in the nature of those Jews now, whose religion stands in notions, stir up the rulers and the ignorant people, and incense them against Jesus Christ, to stone all with one consent in whom he is risen. This is, that the scripture might be fulfilled, and the blindness of the people might be discovered. The same power now is made manifest, and doth overturn the world, as did then overturn the world, to the exalting of the Lord, and the pulling down of the kingdom of Satan and of this world, and setting up his own kingdom, to his everlasting praise. The Lord is now exalting himself, and throwing down man's self. The proud one's head is aloft, fearing he should lose his pride and his crown. The priests incense the ignorant people, for fear their trade should go down; and professors shew forth what is in them, being full of rage; which shews that Jesus Christ the substance is not there; but a stony heart, to stone the precious, where it is risen. The carnal mind feeds upon the outward letter; earth feeds upon earth; and that vine∣yard is not dressed, but is full of briers and nettles; and ravenous beasts, swine, dogs, wolves, and lions, and all venomous creatures lodge in that habitation. That house is not swept. These are the persecutors of the just, ene∣mies of the truth, and of Christ. These are blasphemers of God and his truth. These call upon God with their
<PB N="176" REF="037441_0253_100D8F6A5DD1F4F8"/>lips, but their hearts are far from him. These feed on lies; priests and people. These incense the people, and stir up envy; for it begets its own, one like itself. These are as the waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame. These have double eyes; whose bodies are full of dark∣ness. These paint themselves with the prophets, with Christ's, and with the apostles words most fair. Whited walls, painted sepulchres, murderers of the just you are, Your eyes are double, your minds are double, your hearts are double. Ye flatterers, repent and turn from your carnal ends, who are full of mischief; pretending God and godliness, taking him for your cloak; but he will un∣cover you, and he hath uncovered you to his children. He will make you bare, discover your secrets, take off your crown, take away your mantle and your veil, and strip you of your cloathing; that your nakedness may ap∣pear, and how you sit deceiving the nations. Your abo∣mination and your falsehood is now made manifest to those who are of God; who in his power triumph over you, re∣joice over you, the beast, the dragon, the false prophet, the seducer, the hypocrite, the mother of all harlots. Now thou must have thy cup double. Give it to her double. Sing over her, ye righteous ones, sing over them all, ye saints; triumph in glory, triumph over the deceit: sing the song of the lamb; triumph over the world, spread the truth abroad. Come ye captives out of prison; rejoice with one accord, for the joyful days are coming. Let us be glad, and rejoice for ever! Singleness of heart is come; pureness of heart is come; joy and gladness is come. The glorious God is exalting himself: truth hath been talked of, but now it is possessed. Christ hath been talked of; but now he is come and possessed. The glory hath been talked of; but now it is possessed, and the glory of man is defacing. The Son of God hath been talked of; but now he is come, and hath given us an understanding. Unity hath been talked of; but now it is come. Virgins have been talked of; but now they are come with oil in their lamps. He will be glorified alone. Where pride is thrown down, earth and the fleshly will is thrown down, and the pure is raised up; there alone is the Lord exalted. Let the heavens bow down to him, and the earth reel to and fro, and stagger up and down. The Lord is setting up his throne and his crown, and throwing down the crown of man; he alone will be glorified: to whom be
<PB N="177" REF="037441_0254_100D8F6CACFE5B38"/>all honour and glory, all praises and all thanks! He gives his children wisdom and strength, knowledge and virtue, power and riches, blessings and durable substance; an eye to discern, and an ear to hear things singly; brings down the pride of man's heart, and turns the wicked out of the kingdom. The righteous inherit righteousness; the pure, pureness; the holy, holiness. Praises, praises be to the Lord, whose glory now shines, whose day is broken forth; which is hid from the world, hid from all worldly-wise ones, from all the prudent of this world; from the fowls of the air; from all vultures eyes, all venomous beasts, all liars, all dogs, and all swine. But to them that fear his name, the secrets of the Lord are made manifest, the trea∣sures of wisdom are opened, and the fulness of knowledge: for thou, O Lord! dost make thyself manifest to thy children.</P>

<P>WHAT a world is this! how doth the devil gar∣nish himself! how obedient are people to do his will and mind! They are altogether carried away with fooleries and vanities, both men and women. They have lost the hidden man of the heart, the meek and quiet spi∣rit; which with the Lord is of great price. They have lost the adorning of Sarah; they are putting on gold and gay apparel; women plaiting the hair, men and women powdering it; making their backs look like bags of meal. They look so strange, that they can scarce look at one another; they are so lifted up in pride. Pride is flown up into their head; and hath so lifted them up, that they snuff up, like wild asses, and like Ephraim: they feed upon wind, and are got to be like wild heifers, who feed upon the mountains. Pride hath puffed up every one of them. They are out of the fear of God; men and wo∣men. Young and old; one puffs up another. They must be in the fashion of the world, else they are not in esteem; nay they shall not be respected, if they have not gold or silver upon their backs, or if the hair be not
<PB N="178" REF="037441_0255_100D8F6E5099CD38"/>powdered. But if one have store of ribands hanging about his waist, at his knees, and in his hat, of divers colours, red, white, black, or yellow, and his hair pow∣dered; then he is a brave man, then he is accepted, then he is no Quaker. He hath ribands on his back, belly, and knees, and his hair powdered. This is the array of the world. But is not this from the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, or the pride of life? Likewise the women having their gold, their patches on their faces, noses, cheeks, foreheads, their rings on their fingers, wear∣ing gold, their cuffs double under and above, like a butcher with his white sleeves; their ribands tied about their hands, and three or four gold laces about their cloaths; this is no Quaker, say they. This attire pleaseth the world; and if they cannot get these things, they are discontented. But this is not the attire of Sarah, whose adorning was in the hidden man of the heart, of a quiet and meek spirit. This is the adorning of the heathen; not of the apostle, nor of the saints, whose adorning was, not wearing of gold, nor plaiting of hair, but that of a meek and quiet spirit, which is of great price with the Lord. Here was the sobriety and good ornament which was accepted of the Lord. This was Paul's exhortation and preaching. But we see, the talkers of Paul's words live out of Paul's command, and out of the example of Sarah, and are found in the steps of the great heathen, who comes to examine the apostles in his gorgeous ap∣parel. Are not these, that have got ribands hanging about their arms, hands, back, waists, knees, hats, like fiddlers boys? This shews, that they are got into the basest and most contemptible life, who are in the fashion of fiddlers boys and stage-players, quite out of the paths and steps of solid men; in the very steps and paths of the wild heads, who give themselves up to every invention and vanity of the world that appears, and are inventing how to get it upon their backs, heads, feet, and legs; and say, If it be out of the fashion, it is nothing worth. Are not these spoilers of the creation, who have the fat and the best of it, and waste and destroy it? Do not these incumber God's earth? Let that of God in all consciences answer, and who are in the wisdom judge. And further; if one get a pair of breeches like a coat, and hang them about with points, and up almost to the middle, a pair of double cuffs upon his hands, and
<PB N="179" REF="037441_0256_100D8F6FEDA0B9A0"/>a feather in his cap, here's a gentleman; bow before him, put off your hats, get a company of fiddlers, a set of mu∣sick, and women to dance. This is a brave fellow. Up in the chamber; up in the chamber without, and up in the chamber within. Are these your fine Christians? Yea, say they, They are Christians; but say the serious people, They are out of Christ's life, out of the apostle's command, and out of the saints ornament. To see such as are in the fashions of the world before-mentioned, a com∣pany of them playing at bowls, or at tables, or at shovel∣board, or each taking his horse, with bunches of ribands on his head, as the rider hath on his own, perhaps a ring in his ear too, and so go to horse-racing to spoil the crea∣tures. Oh! these are gentlemen indeed, these are bred up gentlemen, these are brave fellows, they must take their recreation; for pleasures are lawful. These in their sports, set up their shouts like wild asses. They are like the kine or beasts, when they are put to grass, lowing when they are full. Here is the glorying of those before-mentioned; but it is in the flesh, not in the Lord. These are bad christians, and shew that they are gluttoned with the crea∣tures, and then the flesh rejoiceth. Here is evil breeding of youth and young women, who are carried away with the vanities of the mind in their own inventions, pride, arrogance, lust, gluttony, uncleanness. They eat and drink, and rise up to play. This is the generation which God is not well pleased with; for their eyes are full of a∣dultery, who cannot cease from evil. These be they that live in pleasures upon earth these be they who are dead while they live; who glory not in the Lord, but in the flesh: these be they that are out of the life that the scrip∣tures were given forth from, who live in the fashions and vanities of the world, out of truth's adorning in the devil's adorning (who is out of the truth) not in the adorning of the Lord, which is a meek and quiet spirit, and is with the Lord of great price. But this ornament and this a∣dorning is not put on by them that adorn themselves, and have the ornament of him that is out of the truth. That is not accepted with the Lord which is accepted in their eye.</P>

<P>It came upon me about this time from the Lord to write <Q>a short paper and send forth, as an exhortation and warn∣ing to the pope, and all kings and rulers in Europe.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YE heads, rulers, kings, and nobles, of all sorts, Be not bitter, nor hasty in persecuting the lambs of Christ, neither turn yourselves against the visitation of God, and his tender love and mercies from on high, who sent to visit you; lest the Lord's hand, arm, and power take hold swiftly upon you; which is now stretched over the world. It is turned against kings, and shall turn wise men backward, will bring their crowns to the dust, and lay them low and level with the earth. The Lord will be king, who gives crowns to whomsoever obey his will. This is the age, wherein the Lord God of heaven and earth is staining the pride of man and defacing his glory. You that profess Christ, and do not love your enemies, but on the contrary shut up and imprison those who are his friends; these are marks that you are out of his life, and do not love Christ, who do not the things he com∣mands. The day of the Lord's wrath is kindling, his fire is going forth to burn up the wicked, which will leave nei∣ther root nor branch. They that have lost their habita∣tion with God are out of his Spirit that gave forth the scriptures, and from the light that Jesus Christ hath enlight∣ened them withal; and so from the true foundation. Therefore be swift to hear, slow to speak, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower to persecute; for the Lord is bringing his people to himself, from all the world's ways, to Christ the way; from all the world's churches, to the church which is in God, the Fa∣ther of our Lord Jesus Christ; from all the world's teach∣ers, to teach his people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mself by his Spirit; from all the world's images, into the image of himself; and from all the world's crosses of stone or wood, into his power which is the cross of Christ. For all these images, crosses, and likenesses are among them that are apostatized from the image of God, the power of God, the cross of Christ, which now fathoms the world, and is throwing down that which is contrary to it; which power of God never chan∣ges.</P>
<P>Let this go to the kings of France and of Spain, and to the pope, for them to prove all things and to hold that which is good. And first to prove, that they have not quenched the Spirit; for the mighty day of the Lord is come, and coming upon all wickedness, ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who will plead with all flesh by fire and by sword. And the truth, the crown of glory,
<PB N="181" REF="037441_0258_100D8F74D220D2C8"/>and the sceptre of righteousness over all shall be exalted; which shall answer that of God in every one upon the earth, though they be from it. Christ is come a light into the world, and doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, that all through him might believe. He that feeleth the light, that Christ hath enlightened him withal, he feeleth Christ in his mind, and the cross of Christ, which is the power of God; he shall not need to have a cross of wood or stone to put him in mind of Christ, or of his cross, which is the power of God manifest in the inward parts.</P>

<P>Besides this I was moved to write a letter to the Protect∣or (so called) <Q>to warn him of the mighty work the Lord hath to do in the nations, and the shaking of them; and to beware of his own wit, craft, subtilty, and policy, or seeking any by-ends to himself.</Q></P>
<P>There was about this time an order for the trying of mi∣nisters (so called) and for approving, or ejecting them out of their places or benefices; whereupon I wrote a paper to the justices and other commissioners, who were appointed to that work.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that are justices, and in commission to try-mi∣nisters, who have so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been in the vineyard of God, see whether they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as are mentioned in the scriptures, whom the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, Christ, and the apostles disapproved of. And if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be such as they disapproved, see how ye can stand, approved in the sight of God, to let such go into his vineyard, and approve of them who will admire your persons because of advantage, and if you do not give them advantage they will not admire your per∣sons; such Jude speaks of. See if they be not such as teach for filthy lucre, for love of money, covetous, such as love themselves, who have a form of godliness, but deny the power; from such the apostle bids, Turn away. The apostles said, their mouths should be stopped, who served not the Lord Jesus, but their own bellies; being evil beasts, flow bellies, who mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rthly things. Paul gave Timothy a description to try ministers by: he said, They must not be covetous, nor given to wine, nor filthy lucre, nor novices; lest being lifted up into pride, they fall into
<PB N="182" REF="037441_0259_100D8F775AA85358"/>the condemnation of the devil. These he was to try and prove without partiality. Take heed of approving such as he disapproved; for since the apostles days, such as he disapproved have had their liberty; and they have told us, The tongues were their original, that they were ortho∣dox men, and that the steeple-house, with a cross on the top of it, was the church (the Papists mass-house, you may look on the top of it and see the sign.) But the scriptures tell us, <Q>All the earth was of one language before the building of Babel.</Q> And when Pilate cruci∣fied Christ, he set the tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin over his head. And John tells us, that the beast had power over the tongues, kindreds and nations: and that the whore sits upon the tongues, of whose cup all nations have drunk, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. John also said, The tongues are waters. Christ gives marks to his disciples, and to the mul∣titude, how to try such as these that you are to try. They are called of men master, they love the chiefest seat in the assemblies, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sayers but not doers; and, said he, they shall put you out of the synagogues. Seven woes he denounced against them, and therefore disapproved them. Christ said, False prophets should come; and John saw, They were come: for they went forth from them; and the world since hath gone after them. But Babylon must be confounded, the mother of harlots; and the devil must be taken, and with him they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and the false prophet must be cast into the lake of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Lamb and his faints over all must reign, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the victory. The Lord sent his prophets of old to cry against the shepherds that sought for the fleece, Ezek. xxxiv. and to cry against such shep∣herds as seck for their gain from their quarter, and never have enough, Isa. v. 6. and to cry against the prophets that prophesied falsely, and the priests that bore rule by their means; which was the filthy and horrible thing, Jer. v. And if you would forbear to give them means, you would see how long they would bear rule. There was in old time a storehouse for the fatherless, strangers, and widows, to come to and be filled; and those did not pros∣per then who did not bring their tithes to the storehouse. But did not Christ put an end to that priesthood, tithes, temple, and priests? Doth not the apostle say, The priest∣hood is changed, the law is changed, and the command∣ment disannulled? Might not they have pleaded the law
<PB N="183" REF="037441_0260_100D8F79DD096D08"/>of God, that gave them tithes? Was not the first author of them since Christ's time the pope, or some of his church? Did the apostles cast men into prison for tithes, as your ministers do now? As instance: Ralph Holling∣worth, priest of Phillingham, for petty tithes, not exceed∣ing six shillings, hath cast into Lincoln prison a poor thatcher, Thomas Bromby; where he hath been about eight and thirty weeks, and still remains prisoner: and the priest petitioned the judge, that the poor man might not labour in the city to get a little money towards his maintenance in prison. Is this a good savour amongst you that are in commission to choose ministers? Is this glad ti∣dings? to cast in prison a man that is not his hearer, be∣cause he could not put into his mouth? Can such as are in the fear of God, and in his wisdom, own such things? the ministers of Christ are to plant a vineyard, and then eat of the fruit; to plow, sow, and thresh, and get the corn; and then let them reap: but not cast them into prison for whom they do no work. Christ, when he sent forth his ministers, bid them give freely as they had re∣ceived freely; and into what city or town soever they came, inquire who were worthy and there abide; and what they set before you, said he, that eat. And when these came back again to Christ, and he asked them, If they wanted any thing? they said, No. They did not go to a town, and call the people together, to know how much they might have by the year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these that are in the apo∣stacy do now. The apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Have I not power to eat and to drink? But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not say, To take tithes, easter-reckonings, midsummer-dues, augmentations, and great sums of money; but have I not power to eat and to drink? Yet he did not use that power among the Corinthians. But they that are apostatized from him will take tithes, great sums of money, easter-reckonings, and midsummer-dues; and cast those into prison that will not give it them, whom they do no work for. The ox's mouth must not be muzzled that treads out the corn; but see if the corn be trodden out in you, and the wheat be in the garner? This is from a lover of your souls, and one that disires your eternal good.</P>

<P>After I had made some stay in the city of London, I was moved of the Lord to go into bedfordshire to John
<PB N="184" REF="037441_0261_100D8F7BE8202FB0"/>Crook's; where there was a great meeting, and people ge∣nerally convinced of the Lord's truth. When I was come thither. John Crook told me, that the next day several of those called the gentlemen of the country would come to dine with him, and to discourse with me. They came, and I declared to them God's eternal truth. Several friends went to the steeple-houses that day. And there was a meet∣ing in the country, which Alexander Parker went to; and towards the middle of the day it came upon me to go to it, though it was several miles off. John Crook went with me. When we came there, there was one—Gritton, who had been a Baptist, but he was got higher than they, and called himself a trier of spirits. He used to tell people their fortunes, and pretended to discover when goods were stolen, or houses broken up, who the persons were that did it: by which he had got into the affections of many thereabouts. This man was in that meeting speaking, and making an hi∣deous noise over the young convinced friends, when I came in; and he bid Alexander Parker give a reason of his hope. Alexander Parker told him, Christ was his hope; but be∣cause he did not answer him so soon as he expected, he boastingly cried, His mouth is stopped. Then Gritton directed his speech to me; for I stood still and heard him express many things not agreeable to scripture. I asked him, <Q>Whether he could make those things out by scrip∣ture which he had spoken?</Q> He said, Yes, yes. Then I bid the people take out their bibles and search the places he should quote for proof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his assertions; but he could not make good by scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he had said. So he was ashamed, and fled out of the house, and his people were generally convinced; for his spirit was discovered, and he came no more amongst them. When they were settled in God's truth, they published a book against him, denying his spirit and his false discoveries. Many were turned to Christ that day, and came to sit under his teaching; inso∣much that the judges were in a great rage, and many of the magistrates in Bedfordshire, because so many were turned from the hireling priests to the Lord Jesus Christ's free teaching. But John Crook was kept by the power of the Lord; yet he was discharged from being a justice.</P>
<P>After some time I returned to London again; where friends were finely established in the truth, and great com∣ings-in there were. About this time several friends went beyond sea, to declare the everlasting truth of God. When
<PB N="185" REF="037441_0262_100D8F7E886A4FE8"/>I had staid awhile in the city, I went into Kent. When we came into Rochester, there was a guard kept to examine passengers; but we passed by, and were not stopped. So I went to Cranbrook, where there was a great meeting; se∣veral soldiers were at it, and many were turned to the Lord that day. After the meeting some of the soldiers were somewhat rude; but the Lord's power came over them. Thomas Howsigoe, an Independent preacher, who lived not far from Cranbrook, was convinced, and became a faith∣ful minister for the Lord Jesus. Some friends had travelled into Kent before, as John Stubbs and William Caton; and the priests and professors had stirred up the magistrates at Maidstone to whip them for declaring God's truth unto them; as may be seen in the journal of William Caton's life. Captain Dunk was also convinced in Kent. He went with me to Rye, where we had a meeting; to which the mayor, officers, and several captains came. They took what I said in writing, which I was well pleased with. All was quiet, and the people affected with the truth.</P>
<P>From Rye I went to Rumney, where the people had notice of my coming some time before. There was a very large meeting. Thither came Samuel Fisher, an eminent preacher among the Baptists, who had a parsonage reputed worth two hundred pounds a year; which for conscience sake he had given up. There was also the pastor of the Baptists, and abundance of their people. The power of the Lord was so mightily over the meeting, that many were reached, and one greatly shaken; and the life sprang up in divers. One of the pastors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Baptists, being amazed at the work of the Lord's power, bid one of our friends that was so wrought upon, Have a good conscience. Whereupon I was moved of the Lord to bid him, Take heed of hypocrisy and deceit; and he was silent. A great convincement there was that day. Many were turned from darkness to the divine light of Christ, and came to see their teachers errors, and to sit under the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching; to know him their way, and the covenant of light, which God had given to be their salvation; and they were brought to the one Baptism, and to the one Bap∣tizer, Christ Jesus. When the meeting was done, Samuel Fisher's wife said, <Q>We may discern this day betwixt flesh and Spirit, and distinguish spiritual teaching from fleshly.</Q> The people were generally well satisfied with what had been declared; but the two Baptist teachers and their compa∣ny,
<PB N="186" REF="037441_0263_100D8F801A2121F8"/>when they were gone from the meeting, fell to reason∣ing amongst the people. Samuel Fisher, with divers others, reasoned for the word of life, which had been declared that day, and the other pastor and his party reasoned against it; so it divided them asunder and cut them in the midst. A friend came and told me, <Q>That the Baptists were disputing one with another, and desired me to go to them.</Q> I said, 'Let them alone, the Lord will divide them, and they that 'reason for truth will be too hard for the other: and so it was. Samuel Fisher received the truth in the love of it, became a faithful minister, preached Christ freely, and la∣boured much; being moved of the Lord to go and declare the word of life at Dunkirk, in Holland, and in divers parts of Italy, as Leghorn, and Rome itself; yet the Lord preserved him and his companion John Stubbs out of their inquisitions.</P>
<P>From Rumney I passed to Dover, and had a meeting, where several were convinced. Near Dover a governor and his wife were convinced, who had been Baptists. The Bap∣tists thereabouts were much offended, and grew very envi∣ous; but the Lord's power came over all. Luke Howard of Dover was convinced some time before, and became a faithful minister of Christ.</P>
<P>Returning from Dover I went to Canterbury, where a few honest-hearted people were turned to the Lord; who sate down under Christ's teaching. Thence I passed to Cranbrook again, where I had a great meeting. A friend went to the steeple-house, and was cast into prison; but the Lord's power was manif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, and his truth spread.</P>
<P>From thence I passed into Sussex, and lodged near Horsham, where was a great meeting; and many con∣vinced. Also at Steyning we had a great meeting in the market-house, and several were convinced there and there∣away; for the Lord's power was with us. Several meet∣ings I had thereabouts; amongst the rest a meeting was appointed at a great man's house, and he and his son went to fetch several priests who had threatened to come and dis∣pute. But none of them came, for the Lord's power was mighty in us. A glorious meeting we had. The man of the house and his son were vexed, because none of the priests would come. So the hearts of the people were opened by the Spirit of God, and they were turned from the hirelings to Christ Jesus, their shepherd, who had pur∣chased them without money, and would seed them without
<PB N="187" REF="037441_0264_100D8F81F29DA440"/>money or price. Many that came, expecting to hear a dispute, were convinced; amongst whom Nicholas Beard was one.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord's power came over all, and his day many came to see. There were abundance of Ranters in those parts, and professors, who had been so loose in their lives that they began to be weary of them, and had thought to have gone into Scotland to have lived privately; but the Lord's net catched them, and their understandings were opened by his light, Spirit, and power, through which they came to receive the truth, and to be settled upon the Lord; and so became very sober men, and good friends in the truth. Great blessing and praising the Lord there was amongst them, and great admiration in the country.</P>
<P>Out of Sussex I travelled till I came to Reading; where I found a few that were convinced of the way of the Lord. I staid till the first-day, and had a meeting in George Lam∣boll's orchard; and a great part of the town came to it. A glorious meeting it proved; great convincement there was, and the people were mightily satisfied. Thither came two of judge Fell's daughters to me, and George Bishop, of Bristol, with his sword by his side, for he was a captain. After the meeting many Baptists and Ranters came privately, reasoning and discoursing; but the Lord's power came over them. The Ranters pleaded, that God made the devil: I denied it, and told them, <Q>I was come into the power of God, the seed Christ, which was before the devil was, and bruised his head; and he became a de∣vil by going out of truth; and so became a murderer and a destroyer. I shewed them, that God did not make him a devil; for God is a God of truth, and made all things good, and blessed them; but God did not bless the devil. And the devil is bad, and was a liar and a murderer from the beginning, and spoke of himself, and not from God.</Q> So the truth stopt and bound them, and came over all the highest notions in the nation, and confounded them. For by the power of the Lord I was manifest, and sought to be made manifest to the Spirit of God in all, that by it they might be turned to God; as many were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ by the holy Spirit, and were come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it under his teaching.</P>
<P>After this I passed to London, where I staid awhile, and had large meetings: then went into Essex, and came to Cogshall, where was a meeting of about two thousand
<PB N="188" REF="037441_0265_100D8F84EEE0CB20"/>people, as it was judged, which lasted several hours, and a glorious meeting it was; for the word of life was freely declared, and people were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, their teacher and Saviour, the way, the truth, and the life.</P>
<P>On the sixth-day I had a large meeting near Colchester, to which many professors and the Independent teachers came. After I had done speaking, and was stept down from the place on which I stood, one of the Independent teachers began to make a jangling; which Amor Stoddart perceiv∣ing, said, Stand up again, George; for I was going away, and did not at the first hear them. But when I heard the Independent, I stood up again, and after awhile the Lord's power came over him and his company; who were con∣founded, and the Lord's truth went over all. A great flock of sheep hath the Lord in that country, that feed in his pastures of life. On the first-day following we had a very large meeting not far from Colchester, wherein the Lord's power was eminently manifested, and the people were very well satisfied; for being turned to the Lord Jesus Christ's free teaching, they received it gladly. Many of these peo∣ple were of the stock of the martyrs.</P>
<P>As I passed through Colchester, I went to visit James Parnel in prison; but the gaoler would hardly let us come in, or stay with him. Very cruel they were to him. The gaoler's wife threatened to have his blood; and in that gaol they did destroy him, as the reader may see in a book printed soon after his death, giving an account of his life and death; and also in an epistle printed with his collected books and writings.</P>
<P>From Colchester I went to Ipswich, where we had a lit∣tle meeting, and very rude; but the Lord's power came over them. After the meeting, I said, <Q>If any had a desire to hear further, they might come to the inn;</Q> and there came in a company of rude butchers that had abused friends: but the Lord's power so chained them they could not do mischief. Then I wrote a paper and gave it forth to the town, <Q>warning them of the day of the Lord, that they might repent of the evils they lived in; directing them to Christ, their teacher and way; and exhorting them to forsake their hireling-teachers.</Q></P>
<P>We passed from Ipswich to Mendlesham, in Suffoll, where Robert Duncon lived. There we had a large meet∣ing that was quiet, and the Lord's power was preciously
<PB N="189" REF="037441_0266_100D8F870C7E5D40"/>felt amongst us. Then we passed to a meeting at captain Lawrence's, in Norfolk; where, it was judged, were above a thousand people; and all was quiet. Many persons of note were present, and a great convincement there was. They were turned to Christ, and many of them received him, and sate down under him, their vine. Here we par∣ted with Amor Stoddart and others, who intended to meet us again in Huntingdonshire.</P>
<P>About the second hour in the morning we took horse for Norwich, where Christopher Atkins, that dirty man, had run out, and brought dishonour upon the blessed truth and the name of the Lord. But he had been denied by friends, and afterwrads he gave forth a paper of condemnation of his sin and evil. We came to Yarmouth, and staid awhile; where there was a friend, Thoms Bond, in prison, for the truth of Chirst. There we had some service; some being turned to the Lord in that town. From thence we rode to another town about twenty miles off, where were many tender people. I was moved of the Lord to speak to the people as I sat upon my horse, in several places as I passed along. We went to another twon about five miles from thence, and set upon my horse, in several places as I passed along. We went to another town about five miles from thence, and set upon my horses as an inn; Richard Hubber∣thorn annd I having travelled five-and-forty miles that day. There were some friendly people in the town; and we had a tender, broken meeting amongst them, in the Lord's power, to his paise.</P>
<P>We bid the hostler have our horses ready by three in the morning; for we imended to tide to Lynn, about three-and-thirty miles, next morning. But when we were in bed, about elevent at night came the constable and officers, with a great rabble of people into the inn, and said, They were come with an hue and cry from a justice of peace, that lived near the town where I had spoken to the people in the streets as I rode along, to search for two horsemen that rode upon grey horses, and in grey cloaths; an house having been broken upon the seventh-day before at night. We told them, <Q>We were honest innocent men, and ab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horred such things;</Q> yet they apprehended us, and set a guard with halberds and pikes upon us that night; making some of those friendly people, with others, watch us. Next morning we were up betime, and the constable with is guard carried us bofore a justice of peace about five miles off. We took two or three of the sufficient men of the twon with us, who had been at the meeting at captain
<PB N="190" REF="037441_0267_100D8F88D2B5DB20"/>Lawrence's, and could testify that we lay both the seventh-day night and the first-day night at captain Lawrence's; and it was the seventh-day night that they said the house was broken up. The reader is to be informed, that during the time I was prisoner at the Mermaid at Charing-Cross, this captain Lawrence brought several Independent justices to see me there, with whom I had a great deal of discourse; which they took offence at. For they pleaded for imperfec∣tion, and to sin as long as they lived; but did not like to hear of Christ's teaching his people himself, and making people as clear whilst here upon the earth as Adam and Eve were before they fell. These justices had plotted toge∣ther this mischief against me in the country, pretending an house was broken up; that they might send their hue and cry after me. They were vexed also and troubled to hear of the great meeting at John Lawrence's; for a colonel was convinced there that day, who lived and died in the truth. But Providence so ordered, that the constable carried us to a justice about five miles onward in our way towards Lynn, who was not an Independent justice, as the rest were. When we were brought before him, he began to be angry, because we did not put off our hats to him. I told him, I had been before the protector, and he was not offended at my hat; and why should he be offended, who was but one of his servants? Then he read the hue and cry; and I told him, <Q>That night, wherein the house was said to be broken up, we were at captain Lawrence's house; and that we had several men present could testify the truth thereof.</Q> Thereupon the justice, having examined us and them, said, <Q>He believed we were not the men that had broken the house; but he was sorry,</Q> he said, <Q>that he had no more against us.</Q> We told him, <Q>He ought not to be sorry for not having evil against us, but rather to be glad; for to rejoice when he got evil against people, as for house-breaking or the like, was not a good mind in him.</Q> It was a good while yet before he could resolve, whether to let us go, or send us to prison; and the wicked constable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irred him up against us, telling him, <Q>We had good horses; and that if it pleased him, he would carry us to Norwich gaol.</Q> But we took hold of the justice's confession, <Q>That he believed we were not the men that had broken the house;</Q> and after we had admonished him to fear the Lord in his day, the Lord's power came over him, that he let us go; so their snare was broken. A great peo∣ple
<PB N="191" REF="037441_0268_100D8F8AEF5C7B30"/>were afterwards gathered to the Lord in that town, where I was moved to speak to them in the street, from whence the hue and cry came.</P>
<P>Being set at liberty, we travelled to Lynn; to which we came about the third hour in the afternoon. Having set up our horses, we met with Joseph Fuce, who was an en∣sign. We desired him to speak to as many of the people of the town as he could, that feared God; and the captains and officers to come together: which he did. We had a very glorious meeting amongst them, and turned them to the Spirit of God, by which they might know God and Christ, and understand the scriptures; and learn of God and of Christ, as the prophets and apostles did. Many were convinced there; and a fine meeting there is, of them that are come off from the hirelings teaching, and sit under the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Lynn being then a garrison, we desired Joseph Fuce to get us the gate opened by the third hour next morning; for we had forty miles to ride next day. By that means getting out early, we came next day by the eleventh or twelfth hour to Sutton, near the isle of Ely, where Amor Stoddart, and the friends with him, met us again. A mul∣titude of people was gathered thither, and no less than four priests. The priest of the town made a great jangle; but the Lord's power so confounded him, that he went away. The other three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id; and one of them was convinced. One of the other two, whilst I was speaking, came to lean upon me: but I bid him sit down, seeing he was so sloth∣ful. A great convincement there was that day. Many hundreds were turned from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and from the spirit of error to the Spirit of truth, to be led thereby into all truth. People came to this meeting from Huntingdon, and beyond; the mayor's wife of Cambridge was there also. A glorious meeting it was; many were settled under Christ's teaching, and knew him their Shepherd to feed them: for the word of life was freely declared, and gladly received by them. The meeting ended in the power of the Lord, and in peace; and after it was done, I walked into a garden: where I had not been long, before a friend came and told me, seve∣ral justices were come to break up the meeting. But ma∣ny of the people were gone away; so they missed of their design; and after they had staid awhile, they departed also in a fret.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="037441_0269_100D8F8D48EB4788"/>
That evening I passed to Cambridge. When I came in∣to the town, the scholars, hearing of me, were up, and were exceeding rude. I kept on my horse's back, and rode thro' them in the Lord's power; but they unhorsed Amor Stoddart before he could get to the inn. When we were in the inn, they were so rude in the courts and in the streets, that the miners, colliers, and carters could never be ruder. The people of the house asked us, What we would have for supper? 'Supper!' said I, <Q>were it not that the Lord's power is over them, these rude scholars look as if they would pluck us in pieces, and make a supper of us.</Q> They knew I was so against the trade of preaching, which they were there as apprentices to learn, that they raged as bad as ever Diana's craftsmen did against Paul. At this place John Crook met us. When it was within night, the may∣or of the town, being friendly, came and fetched me to his house; and as we walked through the streets, there was a bustle in the town; but they did not know me, it being darkish. They were in a rage not only against me, but against the mayor also; so that he was almost afraid to walk the streets with me, for the tumult. We sent for the friendly people, and had a fine meeting in the power of God; and I staid there all night. Next morning, having ordered our horses to be ready by the sixth hour, we passed peaceably out of town; and the destroyers were disappointed: for they thought I would have staid long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the town, and intended to have done us mischief; but our passing away early in the morning frustrated their evil purposes against us.</P>
<P>Then we rode to Bishop-Stortford, where some were convinced; and to Hertford, where also some were convin∣ced; and where now there is a large meeting.</P>
<P>From thence we returned to London, where friends re∣ceived us gladly; the Lord's power having carried us through many snares and dangers. Great service we had, for many hundreds were brought to sit under the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ their Saviour, and to praise the Lord through him. James Nayler also was come up to London; and Richard Hubberthorn and I staid some time in the city, visiting friends, and answering gainsayers: for we had great disputes with professors of all sorts. Many reproaches they cast upon truth, and lying slanderous books they gave forth against us; but we answered them, cleared God's truth, set it over them, and the Lord's power was over all.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="037441_0270_100D7F5510CBAEC0"/>
Amongst other services for the Lord, which then lay up∣on me in the city, I was moved to give forth a paper to those that made a scorn at trembling and quaking:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord to you all, that scorn trem∣bling and quaking, who scorn, throw stones at, and belch forth oaths against those who are trembling and quaking, threatening and beating them. Strangers ye are to all the apostles and prophets; and are of the generation that stoned them and mocked them in those ages. Ye are of the scoffers which they spake of, that are come in the last times. Be ye witnesses against yourselves. To the light in all your consciences I speak, that with it you may see yourselves to be out of the life of the holy men of God.</P>
<P>Moses, who was judge over all Israel, trembled, feared, and quaked, when the Lord said unto him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; then he trembled, and durst not behold. This, which makes to tremble now, ye teachers and people scoff at, and scorn those in your streets who witness the power of the Lord. Moses forsook the pleasures of the world, which he might have enjoyed for a season. He might have been called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; he re∣fused it, and forsook Pharaoh's house; yet was no vaga∣bond. David, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, trembled. He was mocked; they made songs on him; they wagged their heads at him. Will you profess David's words, and Moses's words, who are in the generation of your fathers, mockers, scoffers, wonderers and despisers, which are to perish? O blush! Be ashamed of all your profession, and be confounded! Job trembled, his flesh trembled, and they mocked him; so do you now mock them in whom the same power of God is made manifest; yet you profess Job's words. O deceitful hypocrites! will ye not own scripture? O for shame! Never profess scripture words, and deny the power, which, according to the scripture, makes the keepers of the house to tremble, and the strong man to bow him∣self. These things priests, magistrates, and people scoff at; but with the power ye are judged, and by the power and life condemned.</P>
<P>The prophet Jeremiah trembled, he shook, his bones quaked, he reeled to and fro, like a drunken man, when he saw the deceit of the priests and prophets who were
<PB N="194" REF="037441_0271_100D8F9151B59D78"/>turned from the way of God; and they were not ashamed, neither could they blush. Such were gone from the light; and such were they that ruled over the people. But he was brought to cry, O foolish people! that had eyes, and could not see; that had ears, and could not hear; that did not fear the Lord, and tremble at his presence, who placed the sands for bounds to the sea by a perpetual decree, that the waves thereof cannot pass! And be said. <Q>A horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means. Shall not I visit for these things, saith the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged upon such a nation as this?</Q> They were such as did not tremble at the word of the Lord; there∣fore he called them a foolish people. Hear all ye the word of the Lord, ye foolish people, who scorn trembling and quaking. Give over professing the prophet Jeremiah's words, and making a trade of them; for with his words you are judged to be among the scoffers, scorners, and stockers. For he was stocked by your generation; and you now stock them that tremble at the word of the Lord, at the power of the mighty God, which raises up the Seed of God, and throws down the earth which hath kept it down. So you that are in the fall, where death reigneth, enemies of the truth, despising the pow∣er of God, as those of your generation ever did wo and misery is your portion, except y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> speedily repent. Isaiah said, <Q>Hear the word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his word.</Q> And he said, <Q>This was the man that God did regard, who was of a broken and contrite heart, and trembled at his word. When their brethren hated and persecuted them, saying, Let the Lord be glo∣rified; he shall appear to your joy, but they shall be ashamed,</Q> Isa. lxvi. 5. Now all ye scoffers and scorners, that despise trembling, you regard not the word of the Lord; they are not regarded by you, that tremble at the word; who are regarded by the Lord: therefore you are contrary to Isaiah's words. Profess him and his words no more for shame, nor make a trade of his words. Ye that seek for your gain from your quarter, ye greedy, dumb dogs, that never have enough, ye are they that de∣spise trembling; ye are such as Isaiah cried against, who himself witnessed trembling. Here therefore be ye wit∣nesses against yourselves, that with the light in your con∣sciences ye may see ye are out of the prophet Isaiah's spi∣rit,
<PB N="195" REF="037441_0272_100D8F92E5E8A6A0"/>and are haters of them that tremble, whom the Lord regards; but such you regard not, but hate, persecute, mock, and rail against. It is manifest you walk in the steps of your forefathers, that persecuted the prophets. Habakkuk, the prophet of the Lord, trembled. Joel, the prophet of the Lord, said, <Q>Blow the trumpet in Zion, and let all the inhabitants of the earth tremble.</Q> The people shall tremble, and all faces shall gather blackness; and the people shall be much pained. And now this trembling is witnessed by the power of the Lord. This power of the Lord is come; the trumpet is sounding, the earth is shaking; the inhabitants of the earth are trem∣bling; the dead is arising; and the living is praising God: the world is raging; the scoffers are scorning; and they that witness trembling and quaking wrought in them by the power of the Lord, can scarce pass up and down the streets but with stones and blows, fists and sticks, or dogs set at them, or they are pursued with mockings and re∣proaches. Thus you vent your malice against them that witness the power of the Lord, as the prophets did; who are come to the broken heart and contrite spirit; who tremble at the word of the Lord, and whom the Lord regards: these you stone, stock, set your dogs at; these you scoff and scorn; these you revile and reproach; but these reproaches are our riches; praised be the Lord who hath given us p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er over them. If you see one, as Ha∣bakkuk, whose lips quivered, whose belly shook; who said, "Rottenness was entered into his bones," and who trembled in himself; if you see such an one in this condi∣tion now, ye say he is bewitched. Here again you shew yourselves strangers to that power, to that life which was in the prophet: therefore, for shame, never make a pro∣fession of his words, nor a trade of his words; nor of Joel's, who witnessed trembling, which ye scorn and scoff at. Ye proud scorners, misery is your end, except you speedily repent. Daniel, a servant of the most high God, trembled; his strength and his breath were gone. He was prisoned, he was hated, he was persecuted. They laid baits and snares for him, in whom the holy Spirit of God was. For shame, you that make a profession of Da∣niel's words, give over your profession, priests and people, who scoff and scorn at trembling: with the light you are seen to be out of Daniel's life, and by the same power you are judged, at which you scorn and scoff <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again
<PB N="196" REF="037441_0273_100D8F95CA290748"/>be ye witnesses against yourselves, that you are scorners and scoffers against the truth; and with the scripture you are judged to be coutrary to the life of the holy men of God. Paul, a minister of God, made by the will of God a messenger of the Lord Jesus, a vessel of the Lord, to carry his name abroad into several nations, when the dark, blind world have got some of his words and epistles, you teachers make a trade of them, and get great sums of mo∣ney for it, so you destroy souls for dishonest gain; making a trade of his words, and of the rest of the apostles, pro∣phets, and of Christ's words, but denying the Spirit and life that they were guided by, and that power which shook the flesh and the earth; which the apostle witnessed, who said, <Q>When he came among the Corinthians, he was with them in weakness and fear, and in much trembling, that their faith might not stand in the wisdom of words, but in the power of God;</Q> in that power which made him to tremble. This power it is that the world, and all the scoffing teachers, scoff at and scorn at in your towns, in your villages, in your assemblies, in your alchouses. For shame, lay aside all your professions of the apostle's words and conditions! Some that scoff at this power, call it the power of the devil. Some persecute, stone and stock, imprison and whip them, in whom that power is made manifest, and load them with reproaches, as not worthy to walk on the earth; hated and persecat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the off-scour∣ing of all things. Here you may see you are in the steps of your forefathers, who persecuted the apostles, and acted so against them; stocked them, mocked them, prisoned them, stoned them, whipped them, haled them out of the synagogues, reproached them, and shamefully treated them. Do not you here fulfil the scripture and Christ's saying, who said, <Q>If they kill you, they will think they do God service?</Q> Yet you make a profession of Christ's words, of the prophets and apostles words, and call your∣selves churches, and ministers of the gospel. I charge you, in the presence of the living God, to be silent who act such things! Mind the light in your consciences, ye scoffers and scorners, which Christ hath enlightened you withal; that with it ye may see yourselves, what ye act, and what ye have acted; for who act such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God: all such things are by the light condemned.</P>
<P>You who come to witness trembling and quaking, the
<PB N="197" REF="037441_0274_100D8F98821ABDF8"/>powers of the earth to be shaken, the lustful nature to be destroyed, the scorning and scoffing nature judged by the light; in it wait to receive power from him who shakes the earth. That power we own, and our faith stands in it, which all the world scoffs at; the lofty, the proud, the presumptuous, who live in presumption, and yet make a profession of the scriptures, as your fathers the Pharisees did, who were painted sepulchres and serpents; and as the Scribes did, who had the chiesest places in the assem∣blies, stood praying in the synagogues, and were called of men, Masters, whom Christ cried wo against. These are not come so far as the trembling of devils, who believed and trembled. Let that judge you. The light and life of the scripture is seen and made manifest, and with it all you scorners, persecutors, and railers are seen.</P>
<P>Take warning, all ye powers of the earth, how ye per∣secute them whom the world nicknames and calls Quakers, who dwell in the eternal power of God; lest the hand of the Lord be turned against you, and ye be all cut off. To you this is the word of God, Fear and tremble, and take warning; for this is the man whom the Lord doth regard, who trembles at his word; which you, who are of the world, scorn, stock, persecute, and imprison. Here ye may see ye are contrary to God, contrary to the pro∣phets; and are such as hate what the Lord regards, which we, whom the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld scorns, and calls Quakers, own. We exalt and honour that power which makes the devils tremble, shakes the earth, throws down the loftiness of man, the haughtiness of man, and makes the beasts of the field to tremble, and causes the earth to reel to and fro, cleaves it asunder, and overturneth the world. This pow∣er we own, honour, and preach up, whom the world scornfully calls Quakers. But all persecutors, railers, and scorners, stockers and whippers, we deny by that power which throweth down all that nature; as seeing that all who act such things, without repentance, shall not inherit the kingdom of God, but are for destruction.</P>
<P>Rejoice, all ye righteous ones, who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for great is your reward in heaven. Rejoice, ye that suffer for well-doing; for ye shall not lose your reward. Wait in the light, that you may grow up in the life that gave sorth the scriptures; that with it ye may see the saints conditions, and all that which they testified against; with it ye will see the state of those that
<PB N="198" REF="037441_0275_100D8F9A157CC350"/>did reproach and scoff them, mock, persecute, whip, stock, and hale them out of the synagogues before magistrates. To you, who are in the same light and life, the same things they do now; that they may fill up the measure of their fathers. With the light now they are seen, where the light, life, and power of God is made manifest; for as they did unto them, so will they do unto you. Here is our joy; the scripture is fulfilled, and fulfilling; with the light which was before the world was, which is now made manifest in the children of light, they see the world, comprehend it, and the actions of it: for he that loves the world, and turns from the light is an enemy to God; he turneth into wickedness: for the whole world lieth in wickedness. He who turns from the light, turns into the works of evil, which the light of Christ testifies against. By this light, where it is made manifest, all the works of the world are seen and made manifest.</P>

<P>Great was the rage and enmity of the people, professors as well as prophane, against the truth and people of God at this time; and great the contempt and disdain they shewed of friends plainness. Wherefore I was moved to write the following paper, and send it forth, directed as— An epistle to gathered churches into outward forms, upon earth.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL ye churches gathered into outward forms upon the earth, the Son of God is come to reign; he will tread and trample, will shake, and make you quiver, you that are found without his life, his light, and his power. His day hath appeared; mortar and clay will you be found. Breaking, shaking, and quaking is coming among you! Your high building is to be laid desolate; your professed liberty shall be your bondage: the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it. Tremble, ye hypocrites, ye notionists. The fenced cities shall be laid desolate, the fruitful fields shall become a wilderness; your false joy shall become your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaviness: the time of weeping and defolation draweth nigh! Come ye witty ones, see how ye can stand before the Almighty, who is now come to plead with you. You'll fall like leaves, and wither like weeds! Come you, that have boasted of my name, saith the Lord, and have gloried in the flesh, ye shall fade like
<PB N="199" REF="037441_0276_100D8F9BA7262010"/>a flower: who have slain my witness, yet boast of my words, which have been as a song unto you. Come ye novelists, who love novelties, changeable suits of apparel, who are in the fashions outward and inward, putting on one thing this day, and another the other day. <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strip thee,</Q> saith the Lord, <Q>I'll make thee bare, I'll make thee naked, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</Q> What! hast thou professed the prophets words? hast thou professed the apostles words, and my Son's words? hast thou covered thyself with their expressions? thinkest thou not that I see thee out of my life? thinkest thou, thou witty one, to hide thyself where none can see thee? think∣est thou, if thou fliest to the uttermost parts of the earth, that I am not there? Is not the earth mine, and the ful∣ness of it, saith the Lord? Come all ye that have trusted in your own conceited knowledge and wisdom, who were never yet out of the earth, and the lusts of it, never yet got the load of thick clay off you, never were out of the drunken spirit, whose imperfection appears, which must be come upon as a potter's vessel; broken cisterns; ye that have been wise in your own conceit, wise in your own eyes, in which pride hath lifted you up, and not humility; you must be abased. You have run on, every one after his own invention, and every man hath done that which was right in his own eyes, that which pleased himself. This hath been the course of people upon earth. Ye have run on without a king, without Christ, the light of the world, which hath enlightened every one that is come into the world. But now is truth risen, now are your fruits withering. You that are fortified, and have fortified your strong houses, called your churches, make your cords strong, the Lord will break you asunder, ye that are gathering in, and ye that are gathered. For the Lord is risen to scatter you, his witness is risen in the hearts of his people; they will not be fed with dead words, nor with that which dies of itself; nor will they be satisfied with the husks which the swine feed upon. All ye priests in the nation, and teachers, that now stand against the light, your envy shews that ye are in Cain's way; your greediness shews that ye are in Balaam's way; your standing against the light, which hath enlightened eve∣ry man that cometh into the world, doth manifest that you are in Core's way, that spoke the great high words of va∣nity; ye, whose consciences are seared as with an hot iron,

O the grievous actions that are seen done by you, the ministers of unrighteousness; whose fruits declare to the whole nation, that you are not the messengers of God! your actions declare it; your taking tithes, augmenta∣tions, treble damages, midsummer-dues, as ye call them, of those ye do no work for, nor minister to.</P>

Come you proud, lofty ones, who have not considered the handy-works of the Lord, but have destroyed them; nor have regarded the way of the Lord, but have had plenty of the creatures; and have therewith fatted up yourselves, and forgotten the Lord and his way: O let shame cover your faces here upon earth! Come ye, that are given to pleasures, who spend your time in sports, idleness, and fulness; your fruits dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the sins of So∣dom; yet you will make a talk of my name, and of my saints words. "But I behold you afar off," saith the Lord. You are proud and lofty; you are bad patterns, bad examples. full, rich, and idle; who say, others are idle, that cannot maintain your lusts. Oh! the unright∣eous balances that are among people! O the iniquity in measuring! O the oppression in ruling and govern∣ing! Because of these things my hand shall come upon you, saith the Lord. For the oppression is entered into the ears of the Lord, who gives rest to the wearied, to the hardened, to the oppressed; who feeds the hungry, and clothes the naked; who brings the mighty from their seats, beats the lofty to the ground, and makes the haughty bend. Come, faith the Lord, ye meckers, scorners, and rebellious ones, light and wild people, vain and heady; you have had your day of joy, you have scoffed, you have mocked and derided my messengers, my ambassadors, who have preached in your streets, and cried in your sy∣nagogues

I'll take away your pride and your height; I'll shake you as a leaf, and bring you to be as men distracted. I'll distract you, and make you that you shall not trust one another in the earth; who have joined hand in hand against my servants in the truth. I'll smite you with terrors, and bring frets and fears upon you; the cup of my indigna∣tion and fury shall you drink. Where will you appear, when repentance is hid from your eyes; when prophane Esau, your father, is set before you, and Ishmael and Cain, wild and envious, whose fruits declare the stock? Come, ye proud priests, who have eaten up the fat of the nation, who by violence have taken other men's goods, whose envy hath slain many, whose wickedness and darkness hath abounded, and whose unrighteousness daily appears. Your fruits every day declare it, in summoning up by writs and subpoenas from most parts of the nation for wages and tithes, such as ye do no work for. Oh! the abomi∣nable unrighteousness! how is the state of man lost, that these things they do not take to heart, to feel them! What havock is made in most parts of the nation by such! And all ye priests and teachers, who are railing and brawl∣ing in the pulpit, setting people at variance one against ano∣ther, haters and hateful, provoking people to hate one another; here is the seed of enmity seen which you have sown and are sowing, whose seed must be brunsed by the seed of the woman, which atop of your heads is set.</P>

<P>This year came out the oath of abjuration, by which many friends suffered. Several friends went to speak with the Protector about it; but he began to harden. And suf∣ferings increasing upon friends, by reason that envious ma∣gistrates made use of that oath as a snare to catch them in, who the knew could not swear at all; I was moved to write to the Protector as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE magistrate is not to bear the sword in vain, who ought to be a terror to the evil-doers; but the ma∣gistrate that bears the sword in vain, as he is not a terror to evil-doers, so he is not a praise to them that do well. Now hath God raised up a people by his power, whom people, priests, and magistrates, out of the fear of God,
<PB N="202" REF="037441_0279_100D9059D4E8E7C0"/>scornfully call Quakers, who cry against drunkenness (for drunkards destroy God's creatures) and cry against oaths (for because of oaths the land mourns) and these drunkards and swearers, to whom the magistrate's sword should be a terror, are, we see, at liberty; but for crying against such, many are cast into prison, and for crying against their pride and filthiness, their deceitful merchandize in mar∣kets. their cozening, their cheating, their excess and naughtiness, their playing at bowls and shovel-boards, at cards and at dice, and their other vain and wanton plea∣sures. Who live in pleasures are dead while they live, and who live in wantonness kill the just. This we know by the Spirit of God which gave forth the scriptures, which God the Father hath given to us, and hath placed his righteous law in our hearts; which law is a terror to evil-doers, and answers that which is of God in every man's conscience. They who act contrary to the measure of God's Spirit in every man's conscience, cast the law of God behind their backs, and walk despitefully against the Spirit of Grace. The magistrate's sword, we see, is borne in vain, whilst evil-doers are at liberty to do evil, and they that cry against such are, for so doing, punished by the magistrate, who hath turned his sword backward against the Lord. Now the wicked one fenceth himself, and persecutes the innocent, as vagabonds and wanderers, for crying against sin, unrighteousness, and ungodliness openly, in the markets and in the highways; or as railers, because they tell them what judgment will come upon those that follow such practices. Here they that depart from iniquity are become a prey, and few lay it to heart. But God will thresh the mountains, beat the hills, cleave the rocks, and cast into his press which is trodden with∣out the city, and will bathe his sword in the blood of the wicked and unrighteous. You that have drunk the cup of abominations, an hard cup have you to drink, you who are the enemies of God, of you he will be avenged. You in whom something of God is remaining, consider; If the sword was not borne in vain, but turned against evil-doers, the righteous would not suffer, and be cast into holes, dungeons, corners, prisons, and houses of correction, as peace-breakers, for crying against sin openly, as they are commanded of the Lord, and for crying against the covetousness of the priests and their false worships; who exact money of poor people, whom they do no work for.
<PB N="203" REF="037441_0280_100D7F61C239C360"/>Oh! where will you appear in the day of the Lord? How will you stand in the day of his righteous judgment? How many gaols and houses of correction are now made places to put the lambs of Christ in, for following him and obeying his commands! The royal law of Christ, "To do as ye would be done by," is trodden down under foot; so that men can profess him in words, but crucify him wheresoever he appears, and cast him into prison, as the talkers of him always did in generations and ages past. The labourers, which God, the master of the harvest, hath sent into his vineyard, do the chief of the priests and the rulers now take counsel together against to cast them into prison: here are the fruits of priests, people, and rulers, without the fear of God. The day is come and coming that every man's work doth and shall appear; glo∣ry be to the Lord God for ever! See and consider the days you have spent, and the days you do spend; for this is your day of visitation. Many have suffered great fines, because they could not swear, but abide in Christ's doctrine, who saith, Swear not at all: and by that means are they made a prey upon for abiding in the command of Christ. Many are cast into prison and made a prey up∣on, because they cannot take the oath of abjuration, tho' they denied all that is abjured in it; and by that means many of the messengers and ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ are cast into prison, because they will not swear nor go out of Christ's command. Therefore, O man! consi∣der; to the measure of the life of God in thee I speak. Many also lie in gaols, because they cannot pay the priests tithes; many have their goods spoiled, and treble dama∣ges taken of them; many are whipped and beaten in the houses of correction, who have broken no law. These things are done in thy name, in order to protect them in these actions. If men fearing God bore the sword, and covetousness was hated, and men of courage for God were set up, then they would be a terror to evil-doers and a praise to them that do well; and not cause such to suffer. Here equity would be heard in our land, and righteous∣ness would stand up and take place; which giveth not place to the unrighteous, but judgeth it. To the measure of God's Spirit in thee I speak, that thou mayest consider and come to rule for God: that thou mayest answer that which is of God in every man's conscience; for that is it which bringeth to honour all men in the Lord. There∣fore
<PB N="204" REF="037441_0281_100D7F64E3249118"/>consider for whom thou rulest, that thou mayest come to receive power from God to rule for him; and all that is contrary to God may by his light be condemned.</P>

<P>Sufferings and imprisonments continuing and increasing, and the Protector, under whose name they were inflicted, hardening himself against the complaints that were made to him, I was moved to give forth the following lines amongst friends, to bring the weight of their sufferings more heavy upon the heads of the persecutors.</P>

Likewise where any suffer for the truth by them who are in the untruth, if any brother be moved of the Lord to go to the magistrate, judge, gene∣ral, or protector, and offer up themselves to the prison, to lay down their lives for the brethren; as Christ hath laid down his life for you, so offer your lives one for ano∣ther.

<P>After I had cleared myself of those services for the Lord. which lay upon me in the city of London, I passed into Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire. At Wellingborough, in Northamptonshire, I had a great meeting, in which the Lord's everlasting power and truth was over all; and many in that country were turned to the Lord. Great rage was amongst the professors; for the wicked priests, Presbyteri∣ans, and Independents falsely reported, <Q>That we carried bottles about with us, which we gave people to drink of, which made them follow us:</Q> but the Power. Spirit, and Truth of God kept friends over the rage of the people. Great spoiling also there was of friends goods for tithes by the Independent, Presbyterian, and some Baptist p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sts, who had got into the sleeple-houses.</P>
<P>From Wellingborough I went into Leicestershire, where colonel Hacker had threatened, If I came he would impri∣son me again, though the Protector had set me at liberty: but when I was come to Whetstone, the meeting from which he took me before, all was quiet. Colonel Hacker's wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and his marshal came to the meeting, and were convinced; for the glorious, powerful day of the Lord was exalted over all, and many were convinced that day. There were at that meeting two justices of the peace from Wales, their names
<PB N="206" REF="037441_0283_100D8FA4AE6E13F0"/>were Peter Price and Walter Jenkin; who came both to be ministers of Christ.</P>
<P>I went from thence to Sileby, to William Smith's, where was a great meeting, to which several Baptists came; one of them, a Baptist teacher, was convinced, and came to sit under the Lord's teaching by his Spirit and Power. This Baptist said. He had baptized thirty in a day.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Drayton, my native town, where so many priests and professors had formerly gathered to∣gether against me; but now never a priest nor professor did appear. I asked some of my relations, Where all the priests and professors were? They said the priest of Non-eaton was dead, and eight or nine of them were secking to get his benefice. 'They will let you alone now,' said they, <Q>for they are like a company of crows, when a rotten sheep is dead, they all gather together to pull out the puddings; so do the priests for a fallen benefice.</Q> These were some of their own hearers that said so of them: but they had spent their venom against me, and the Lord delivered me by his power out of their snare.</P>
<P>Then I went to Badgley, where was a great meeting. Numbers came far to it. Many were convinced, and turn∣ed to the Lord; who came under christ's teaching, and were settled upon him, their foundation and rock.</P>
<P>From thence I passed into Nottinghamshire, and had large meetings; and into derbyshire, where the Lord's power came over all. Many were turned from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and came to re∣ceive the Holy Ghost. Great miracles were wrought in many places by the power of the Lord through several.</P>
<P>In Derbyshire James Nayler met me, and told me, se∣ven or eight priests had challenged him to a dispute. I had a travail in my Spirit for him, and the Lord answered me. I was moved to bid him go on, <Q>and God Almighty would be with him, and give him the victory in his pow∣er.</Q> And the Lord did so; insomuch that the people saw the priests were foiled, and cried, <Q>A Nailer, a Nailer hath confuted them all.</Q> After the dispute he came to me again, praising the Lord. Thus was the Lord's day proclaimed, and set over all their heads. People began to see the apos∣tacy and slavery they had been under to their hireling teachers, and came to know their teacher the Lord Jesus, who had purchased them, and made their peace betwixt God and them. While we were here, friends came out of
<PB N="207" REF="037441_0284_100D8FA702C361D8"/>Yorkshire to see us, and were glad of the prosperity of truth.</P>
<P>After this I passed into Warwickshire amongst friends, visiting their meetings; and so into Worcestershire. I had a meeting at Birmingham, where several were convinced, and turned to the Lord. I came to one Cole's house near Chattan. This Cole had given an Independent preacher a meeting-place, who came to be convinced; after which he laid aside his preaching; whereupon the old man— Cole gave him an hundred pounds a year. I had a meet∣ing there; a very great one it was, insomuch that the meeting-place would not hold the people. Many were turned to the Lord that day. Afterwards, when the time of trials came, this Independent did not stand to that which had convinced him; but turned back: whereupon the old man took away his 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year from him again. But Cole himself died in God's truth.</P>
<P>I heard that at Evesham the magistrates had cast several friends into divers prisons; and that, hearing of my coming, they made a pair of high stocks. I sent for Edward Pitta∣way, a friend, who lived near Evesham, and asked him the truth of the thing. He said, it was so. I went that night with him to Evesham; and in the evening we had a large, precious meeting, wherein friends and people were refresh∣ed with the word of life, the power of the Lord. Next morning I rode to one of the prisons, and visited friends there, and encouraged them. Then I rode to the other prison, where were several prisoners. Amongst them was Humphry Smith, who had been a priest, but was now be∣come a free minister of Christ. When I had visited friends at both prisons, and was turned to go out of the town, I espied the magistrates coming up the town to have seized me in prison. But the Lord frustrated their intent, the in∣nocent escaped their snare, and God's blessed power came over them all. But exceeding rude and envirous were the priests and professors about this time in these parts.</P>
<P>I went from Evesham to Worcester, and had a precious meeting there, and quiet. After which, coming towards our inn, some professors fell to discourse with friends, and were like to have made a tumult in the city. As we went into the inn, they all cluttered into the yard; but I went among them and got them quieted. Next day I walked into the town, and had a great deal of discourse with some of the professors concerning Christ and the way of truth.
<PB N="208" REF="037441_0285_100D8FA905412378"/>One of them denied, that Christ was of Abraham according to the flesh, and that he was declared to be the Son of God according to the Spirit. I proved from Rom. i. that he was of the seed of Abraham, being made of the seed of Da∣vid according to the flesh; and that according to the Spirit he was declared to be the Son of God. Afterwards I wrote a paper concerning it.</P>
<P>From Worcester we went to Tewksbury, where in the evening we had a great meeting, to which came the priest of the town with a great rabble of rude people. The priest boasted, that he would see whether he or I should have the victory. <Q>I turned the people to the Divine Light, which Christ, the heavenly and spiritual man, enlighteneth them withal; that with that Light they might see their sins, and that they were in death and darkness, and with∣out God in the world; and might also see Christ from whom it cometh, their Saviour and Redeemer, who shed his blood and died for them; who is the way to God, the truth, and the life.</Q> Here the priest began to rage against the Light, and denied it; for neither priest nor professor could endure to hear the Light spoken of. Having railed at the Light the priest went away, and left his rude com∣pany amongst us; but the Lord's power came over them, though mischief was in their hearts.</P>
<P>Leaving Tewksbury we passed to Warwick, where in the evening we had a meeting at a widow-woman's house with many sober people. A precious meeting we had in the Lord's power; several were convinced, and turned to the Lord. After the meeting, a Baptist in the company began to jangle; and the bailiff of the town, with his officers, came in and said. What do these people here at this time of night? So he secured John Crook, Amor Stoddart, Gerrard Roberts, and me; but we had leave to go to our inn, and to be forth-coming in the morning. The next morning many rude people came into the inn, and into our chambers, desperate fellows; but the Lord's power gave us dominion over them. Gerrard Roberts and John Crook went to the batliff to know what he had to say to us. He said, we might go our ways, for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to say to us. As we rode out of town, it lay upor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to ride to his house, to let him know. <Q>That the Prote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>r having giver forth an instrument of government, in which liberty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> science was grante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it was very strange that, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that instrument of government, he would trouble peace∣able
<PB N="209" REF="037441_0286_100D8FAB102C7508"/>people that feared God.</Q> The friends went with me. but the rude people gathered about us with stones. One of them took hold of my horse's bridle, and broke it; but the horse drawing back threw him under him. Though the bailiff saw this, yet he did not stop, not so much as rebuke the rude multitude; so that it was much we had not been slain or hurt in the streets; for the people threw stones and struck at us as we rode along the town.</P>
<P>When we were quite out of the town, I told friends, <Q>It was upon me from the Lord that I must go back into the town again; and if any one of them felt any thing upon him from the Lord, he might follow me; the rest that did not, might go on to Dun-cow.</Q> So I passed through the market in the dreadful power of God, declar∣ing the word of life to them; and John Crook followed me. Some struck at me; but the Lord's power was over them, and gave me dominion over all. I shewed them their unworthiness of the name of christians, and the un∣worthiness of their teachers, that had not brought them into more sobriety; and what a shame they were to christianity!</P>
<P>Having cleared myself I turned out of the town again, and passed to Coventry; where we found the people closed up with darkness. I went to a professor's house I had for∣merly been at, and he was drunk; which grieved my soul so, that I did not go into any house in the town; but rode into some of the streets, and into the market-place. I felt the power of the Lord was over the town.</P>
<P>Then I went to Dun-cow, and had a meeting in the evening, and some were turned to the Lord by his Spirit, as some also were at Warwick and Tewksbury. We lay at Dun-cow that night; where we met with John Camm, a faithful minister of the everlasting gospel. In the morning there gathered a rude company of priests and people, who behaved more like beasts than men; for some of them came riding on horseback into the room where we were; but the Lord gave us dominion over them.</P>
<P>From thence we passed into Leicestershire, where we had a great meeting at the place where I had been taken for∣merly. After that we came to Badgley, in Warwickshire. Here William Edmundson who lived in Ireland, having some drawings upon his spirit to come into England to see me, met with me; by whom I wrote a sew lines to friends then convinced in the north of Ireland.</P>

<P>When these few lines were read amo gst the friends in Ireland at their meeting, the power of the Lord seized up∣on all in the room.</P>
<P>From Badgley we passed to Swanington and Higham, and into Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire, having great meet∣ings. Many were turned to the Lord by his Power and Spirit. When we came to Baldock in Hertfordshire, I ask∣ed, 'If there was nothing in that town, no profession?' It was answered me, There were some Baptists, and a Baptist woman sick. John Rush of Bedfordshire went with me to visit her. When we came in, many tender people were about her. They told me, <Q>She was not a woman for this world; but if I had any thing to comfort her concerning the world to come. I might speak to her.</Q> I was moved of the Lord to speak to her; and he raised her up again, to the astonishment of the town and country. Her husband's name was Baldock. This Baptist woman and her husband came to be convinced; and many hundreds of people have met at their house since. Great meetings and convince∣ments were in those parts afterwards; many received the word of life, and fat down under the teaching of Christ their Saviour.</P>
<P>When we had visited this sick woman, we returned to our inn; where we found two desperate fellows fighting so furiously, that none durst come nigh to part them. But I was moved in the Lord's power to go to them: and when I had loosed their hands, I held one of them by one hand, and the other by the other, sheved them the evil of their doings, and reconciled them one to the other; and they were so loving and thankful to me, that people admired at it.</P>
<P>From thence I passed to Market-street, where God had a people; and through Albans to London, where friends were glad of the prosperity of truth, and the manifestation of the Lord's glorious power, which had delivered us, and
<PB N="211" REF="037441_0288_100D8FAEA1337F18"/>carried us through many dangers and difficulties. I also rejoiced to find truth prosper in the city, and all things well amongst friends there. Only there was one John Toldervey, who had been convinced of truth, and run out from it; and the envirous priests took occasion from thence to write a wicked book against friends which they stuffed with many lies, to render truth and friends odious. They intituled their book, "The Foot out of the Snare." But this poor man came to see his folly, and returned, condem∣ned his backsliding, answered the priests book, and mani∣fested all their lies and wickedness. Thus the Lord's pow∣er came over them; his everlasting Seed reigned, and reigns to this day.</P>
<P>After I had tarried some time in London, and had visi∣ted friends in their meetings, I went out of town, leaving James Nayler in the city. As I passed from him, I cast my eyes upon him, and a fear struck me concerning him; but I went away, and rode to Ryegate in Surry where I had a little meeting. There friends told me of one Tho∣mas Moore, a justice of peace, that lived not far from Rye∣gate, a friendly, moderate man; whereupon I went to visit him at his house, and he came to be a serviceable man in truth.</P>
<P>We passed to Thomas Patchings, of Binscombe in Go∣dalming, where we had a meeting, to which several friends came from London. John Bolton and his wife came on soot in frost and snow. After we had parted with friends there, we went towards Horsham Park; where having visit∣ed friends, we went to Arundel and Chichester, where we had meetings. At Chichester many professors came in, and made some jangling: but the Lord's power was over them. The woman of the house, where the meeting was, though convinced of truth, yet not keeping her mind close to that which convinced her, she fell in love with a man of the world, who was there that time. When I knew it, I took her aside, and was moved to speak to her and to pray for her; but a light thing got up in her mind, and she slighted it. Af∣terwards she married that man; and soon after went dis∣tracted; Then was I sent for to her; and the Lord was entreated, raised her up again, and settled her mind by his power. Afterwards her husband died; and she acknowledged the just judgments of God were come upon her, for slight∣ing the exhortation and counsel I had given he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="037441_0289_100D8FB0B1676A48"/>
After we left Chichester, we travelled to Portsmouth. There the soldiers had us to the governor's house. After some examination, the Lord's power came over them, and we were set at liberty, and had a meeting in the town. Af∣ter which we came to Ringwood, where in the evening we had a meeting. Several were convinced, and turned to the Spirit of the Lord, and to the teaching of Christ Jesus their Saviour.</P>
<P>From Ringwood we came to Pool; and, having set up our horses at an inn, we sent into the town to inquire for such as feared the Lord, and such as were worthy; and we had a meeting there with several sober people. William Baily, a Baptist teacher, was convinced at that time. The people received truth in the inward parts, and were turn∣ed to the Lord Jesus Christ, their rock and foundation, their teacher and Saviour; and there is become a great ga∣thering in the name of Jesus of a very tender people, who continue under Christ's teaching.</P>
<P>We went also to Southampton, and had a meeting, where several were convinced. Edward Pyot of Bristol travelled with me all this western journey.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Dorchester, and alighted at an inn, a Baptist's house: we sent into the town to the Bap∣tists, to let us have their meeting-house to assemble in, and to invite the sober people to the meeting; but they denied it us. We sent to them again, to know why they would deny us their meeting-house? so the thing was noised in the town. Then we sent them word, If they would not let us come to their house, they, or any people that feared God, might come to our inn, if they pleased; but they were in a great rage. Their teacher, and many of them came up, and flapped their bibles on the table. I asked them, <Q>Why they were so angry? were they angry with the bible?</Q> But they fell into a discourse about their water∣baptism. I asked them, <Q>Whether they could say they were sent of God to baptize people, as John was? And whether they had the same Spirit and power that the apos∣tles had?</Q> They said, They had not. Then I asked them, <Q>How many powers there are? Whether there are any more than the power of God, and the power of the devil?</Q> They said. There was not any other power than those two. Then said I, <Q>If you have not the power of God that the apostles had, you act by the power of the devil.</Q> Many sober people were present, who said, <Q>They
<PB N="213" REF="037441_0290_100D8FB351E6C768"/>have thrown themselves on their backs.</Q> Many substan∣tial people were convinced that night; a precious service we had there for the Lord, and his power came over all. Next morning, as we were passing away, the Baptists, be∣ing in a rage, began to shake the dust off their feet after us. 'What,' said I, <Q>in the power of darkness! We, who are in the power of God, shake off the dust of our feet against you.</Q></P>
<P>Leaving Dorchester, we came to Weymouth; where also we inquired after sober people; and about fourscore of them gathered together at a priest's house, all very sober people. Most of them received the word of life, and were turned to their teacher Christ Jesus, who had enlightened them with his divine light, by which they might see their sins, and him who saveth from sin. A blessed meeting we had with them, and they received the truth in the love of it, with gladness of heart. The meeting held several hours. <Q>The state of their teachers, and the apostacy was opened to them; and the state of the apostles, and of the church in their days: and the state of the law and of the prophets before Christ, and how Christ came to fulsil them; that he was their teacher in the apostles days; and that he was come now to teach his people himself by his power and spirit.</Q> All was quiet, the meeting broke up peaceably, the people were very loving; and a meeting is continued in that town to this day. Many are added to them; and some who had been Ranters came to own the truth, and to live very soberly.</P>
<P>There was a captain of horse in the town, who sent to me, and would fain have had me to have staid longer; but I was not to stay. He and his man rode out of town with me about seven miles; Edward Pyot also being with me. This captain was the fattest, merriest, cheerfullest man, and the most given to laughter, that ever I met with: insomuch that I was several times moved to speak in the dreadful power of the Lord to him; yet it was become so customary to him, he would presently laugh at any thing he saw. But I still admonished him to come to sobriety, and the fear of the Lord, and sincerity. We lay at an inn that night; and the next morning I was moved to speak to him again, when he parred from us. Next time I saw him, he told me, When I spoke to him at parting, the power of the Lord so struck him, that before he got home he was serious enough, and had left his laughing. He afterwards was convinced, and became a serious good man, and died in the truth.</P>

Parting from him, we went to Honiton; and at our inn inquired, What people were in the town that feared God, and sent for them. There came to us some of the particular Baptists, with whom we had a great deal of rea∣soning. I told them, <Q>They held their doctrine of par∣ticular election in Esau's, Cain's, and Ishmael's nature; not in Jacob, the second birth: but they must be born again before they could enter the kingdom of God. And that as the promise of God was to the Seed, not as many, but as one, which was Christ; so the election and choice stainds in Christ; and they must be such as walk in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth.</Q></P>
<P>From thence we passed to Topsham, and staid over first, day; but the inn-keeper and his people were rude. Next morning we gave forth some queries to the priests and pro∣fessors: whereupon some rude professors came to our inn; and, had we not gone when we did, they had stopped us. I wore a girdle, which through forgetfulness I left behind me, and afterwards sent to the inn-keeper for; but he would not let me have it again. Afterwards, when he was troubled in his mind about it, he burnt it, lest he should be bewitched by it, as he said; yet when he had burnt it, he was more trou∣bled than before. Some, notwithstanding the rudeness of the place, were convinced, and a meeting was afterwards settled in that town, which hath continued ever since.</P>
<P>After this we passed to To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes, a dark town. We lodged there at an inn; and that night Edward Pyot was sick, but the Lord's power healed him, so that the next day we got to King's Bridge, and at our inn inquired for the sober people of the town. They directed us to Nicholas Tripe and his wise; and we went to their house. They sent for the priest, with whom we had some discourse; but he be∣ing confounded, quickly left us. Nicholas Tupe and his wise were convinced; and since there is a good meeting of friends in that country. In the evening we returned to our inn. There being many people drinking in the house, <Q>I was moved of the Lord to go amongst them, and direct them to the light which Christ the heavenly man had en∣lightened them withal; by which they might see all their evil ways, words, and deeds, and by the same light they might also see Christ Jesus their Saviour.</Q> The inn-keeper stood uneasy, seeing it hindered his guests from drinking; and as soon as the last words were out of my mouth, he snatched up the candle, and said, <Q>Come, here is a light
<PB N="215" REF="037441_0292_100D8FB86CE7E920"/>for you to go into your chamber.</Q> Next morning, when he was cool, I represented to him, <Q>What an uncivil thing it was for him so to do;</Q> then warning him of the day of the Lord, we got ready and passed away.</P>
<P>We came next day to Plymouth, refreshed ourselves at our inn, and went to Robert Cary's, where we had a very precious meeting. At this meeting was Elizabeth Trelaw∣ny, daughter to a baronet. She being somewhat thick of hearing, came close up to me, and clapped her ear very nigh me, while I spake; and she was convinced. After this meeting came in some jangling Baptists; but the Lord's power came over them, and Elizabeth Trelawny gave testi∣mony thereto. A sine meeting was settled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued ever since; where ma∣ny faithful friends have been convinced.</P>
<P>From thence we passed into Cornwall, and came to an inn in the parish of Menhenniot. At night we had a meet∣ing at Edward Hancock's, to which came Thomas Mounce and a priest, with a great deal of people. We brought the priest to confess, That he was a minister made by the state, and maintained by the state; and he was confounded and went his way: but many of the people staid. I directed them to the <Q>light of Christ, by which they might see their sins, and their Saviour Christ Jesus, the way to God, their Me∣diator to make peace betwixt God and them; their Shep∣herd to feed them, and their Prophet to teach them. I di∣rected them to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might know the scriptures, and be led into all truth; and by the Spirit might know God, and in it have unity one with another.</Q> Many were convinced at that time, and came under Christ's teaching; and there are fine gatherings in the name of Jesus in those parts at this day.</P>
<P>We travelled from thence through Penryn, and came to Helston; but could not get to the knowledge of any sober people, through the badness of the inn-keepers. At length we came to a village, where some Baptists and sober people lived, with whom we had discourse. Some of them were brought to confess, that they stumbled at the light of Christ. They would have had us to have staid with them; but we passed thence to Market-Jew; and having taken up our lodging at an inn, we sent over night to inquire for such as feared the Lord. Next morning the mayor and aldermen gathered together, with the high-sheriff of the county; and lent the constables to bid us come before them. We asked
<PB N="216" REF="037441_0293_100D8FBA8ED12EB0"/>them for their warrant; and they saying they had none, we told them, we should not go along with them without a warrant. Upon the return of the constables without us, they sent their sergeants, and we asked them for their war∣rant. They said, they had none; but told us, the mayor and aldermen staid for us. We told them, the mayor and his company did not well to trouble us in our inn; and we should not go with them without a warrant. So they went away, and came again; and when we asked them for their warrant, one of them plucked his mace from under his cloak. We asked them. Whether it was their custom to molest and trouble strangers in their inns and lodgings? After some time Edward Pyot went to the mayor and alder∣men, and a great deal of discourse he had with them; but the Lord's power gave him dominion over them all. When he returned, several of the officers came to us; and we laid before them the incivility and unworthiness of their carriage towards us, the servants of the Lord God, thus to stop and trouble us in our inns and lodgings; and what an unchris∣tian act it was. Before we left the town. I wrote a little paper, to be sent to the seven parishes at the Land's End.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE mighty day of the Lord is come, and coming, wherein all hearts shall be made manifest, and the secrets of every one's heart shall be revealed by the light of Jesus, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, that all men through him might believe, and the the world might have life through him, who saith, <Q>Learn of me;</Q> and of whom God saith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</Q> Christ is come to teach his people himself; and every one that will not hear this Propher, which God hath raisec up, and which Moses spake of, when he said, <Q>Like unto me will God raise you up a Prophet, him shall you hear:</Q> every one, I say that will not hear this prophet, is to be cut off. They that de∣spised Moses's law, died under the hand of two or three witnesses; but how much greater punishment will come upon them that neglect this great salvation. Christ Jesus, who saith. <Q>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life;</Q> who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and by his light lets him see his evil ways and evil deeds. But if you hate that light, and go on in evil, this light will be your condemner. Therefore, now ye have tune, prize it: for this is the day of your visitation,

It is the light that shews you these evil deeds: which if you love, and come unto it, and follow it, it will lead you to Christ, who is the way to the Father, from whom it comes; where no unrighte∣ousness enters, nor ungodliness. If you hate this light, it will be your condemnation; but if you love it, and come to it, you will come to Christ; and it will bring you off from all the world's teachers and ways, to learn of Christ, and will preserve you from the evils of the world, and all the deceivers in it.</P>

<P>This paper a friend, then with me, had; and when we were gone three or four miles from Market-Jew towards the west, he meeting with a man upon the road, gave him a copy of the paper. This man proved to be a servant to Peter Ceely, a major in the army, and a justice of peace in that county; and, riding before us to a place called St. Ives, shewed the paper to his master. When we came to Ives, Edward Pyot's horse having cast a shoe, we staid to have a shoe set; and while he was getting his horse shod, I walked to the sea-side. When I came back, I found the town in an uproar. They were haling Edward Pyot and the other friend before major Ceely. I followed them into the justice's house, though they did not lay hands upon me. When we came in, the house was full of rude people; whereupon I asked, Whether there were not an officer among them, to keep the people civil? Major Ceely said, he was a magistrate. I told him, <Q>He should shew forth gravity and sobriety then, and use his authority to keep the people civil; for I never saw any people ruder: the Indians were more like Christians than they.</Q> After awhile they brought the paper, and asked, Whether I would own it? I said, Yes. Then he tendered the oath of abju∣ration to us: whereupon I put my hand in my pocket, and produced the answer to it, which had been given to the protector. After I had given him that, he examined us severally, one by one. He had with him a silly, young priest, who asked us many frivolous questions; amongst the rest, he desired to cut my hair, which then was pretty long; but I was not to cut it, though many were offended at it,
<PB N="218" REF="037441_0295_100D8FBE4E0278B8"/>I told them, <Q>I had no pride in it; and it was not of my own putting on.</Q> At length the justice put us under a guard of soldiers, who were hard and wild, like the justice himself: nevertheless we <Q>warned the people of the day of the Lord, and declared the truth to them.</Q> The next day he sent us guarded by a party of horse, with swords and pistols, who took us to Redruth. On first-day the soldiers would have carried us away; but we told them, It was their sabbath, and it was not usual to travel on that day. Several of the town's people gathered about us; and whilst I held the soldiers in discourse, Edward Pyot spoke to the people; and afterwards Edward Pyot held the soldiers in discourse whilst I spoke to the people. In the mean time the other friend got out backwards, and went to the steeple∣house, to speak to the priest and people. The people were exceeding desperate, in a mighty rage against him, and abused him. The soldiers also missing him, were in a great rage, and seerred ready to kill us; but I declared the day of the Lord, and the word of eternal life to the people. In the afternoon the soldiers were resolved to have us away; so we took horse. When we had rid to the town's end, I was moved of the Lord to go back again, to speak to the old man of the house. The soldiers drew out their pistols, and swore I should not go back. I heeded them not; but rode back, and they rode after me. So I cleared myself to the old man and the people; and then returned with them, and reproved them for being so rude and violent.</P>
<P>At night we were brought to a town then called Smeth∣ick, but since Falmouth. It being the evening of the first-day, there came into our inn the chief constable of the place, and many sober people; some of whom began to inquire concerning us. We told them, We were prisoners for truth's sake; and a great deal of discourse we had with them concerning the things of God. They were very sober, and very loving to us. Some of them were convinced, and stood faithful ever after.</P>
<P>When the constable and these people were gone, others came in, who also were very civil, and went away very loving. When all were gone, we went to our chamber to go to bed; and about the eleventh hour Edward Pyot said. <Q>I will shut the door, it may be some may come to do us a mischief.</Q> Afterwards we understood captain Keat, who commanded the party, purposed to have done us some in∣jury that night; but the door being bolted, he missed his
<PB N="219" REF="037441_0296_100D8FC046C5B808"/>design. Next morning captain Keat brought a kinsman of his, a rude, wicked man, and put him into the room; him∣self standing without. This evil-minded man walked huff∣ing up and down the room; I bid him fear the Lord. Whereupon he ran upon me, struck me with both his hands; and, clapping his leg behind me, would have thrown me down, if he could; but he was not able, for I stood stiff and still, and let him strike. As I looked to∣wards the door, I saw, captain Keat look on, and see his kinsman thus beat and abuse me. Whereapon I said to him, 'Keat, dost thou allow this?' He said he did. <Q>Is this manly or civil,</Q> said I, <Q>to have us under a guard, and put a man to abuse and beat us? Is this manly, ci∣vil, or christian?</Q> I desired one of our friends to send for the constables, and they came. Then I desired the captain to let the constables see his warrant or order, by which he was to carry us; which he did; and his warrant was, to conduct us safe to captain Fox, governor of Pen∣dennis castle; and if the governor should not be at home, he was to convey us to Lanceston gaol. I told him, He had broken his order concerning us; for we, who were his prisoners, were to be safely conducted; but he had brought a man to beat and abuse us: so he having broken his or∣der, I wished the constable to keep the warrant. Accord∣ingly he did, and told the soldiers, They might go their ways, for he would take charge of the prisoners; and if it cost twenty shillings in charges to carry us up, they should not have the warrant again. I shewed the soldiers the baseness of their carriage towards us; and they walked up and down the house, pitifully blank and down. The constables went to the castle, and told the officers what they had done. The officers shewed great dislike of captain Keat's base carriage towards us; and told the constables, major-general Desborough was coming to Bodmin, and that we should meet him; and it was likely he would free us. Mean-while our old guard of soldiers came by way of entreaty to as, and promised they would be civil to us, if we would go with them. Thus the morning was spent till about the eleventh hour; and then, upon the soldiers en∣treaty, and promise to be more civil, the constables gave them the order again; and we went with them. Great was the civility and courtesy of the constables and people of that town towards us, who kindly entertained us; and the Lord tewarded them with his truth; for many of them have since
<PB N="220" REF="037441_0297_100D8FC325FD1518"/>been convinced thereof, and are gathered into the name of Jesus, and sit under Christ, their Teacher and Saviour.</P>
<P>Captain Keat who commanded our guard, understanding that captain Fox, who was governor of Pendennis castle, was gone to meet major-general Desborough, did not carry us thither; but took us directly to Bodmin, in the way to Lanceston. We met major-general Desborough on the way. The captain of his troop, that rode before him, knew me, and said, 'Oh, Mr. Fox, what do you here?' I re∣plied, 'I am a prisoner.' 'Alack,' said he, 'for what?' I told him, 'I was taken up as I was travelling.' 'Then,' said he, <Q>I will speak to my lord, and he will set you at liberty.</Q> So he came from the head of his troop, and rode up to the coach, and spoke to the major-general. We also gave him an account how we were taken. He began to speak against the light of Christ; against which I ex∣horted him. Then he told the soldiers, They might carry us to Lanceston; for he could not stay to talk with us, lest his horses should take cold.</P>
<P>To Bodmin we were had that night; and when we came to our inn, captain Keat, who was in before us, put me in∣to a room, and went his way. When I was come in, there stood a man with a naked rapier in his hand. Whereupon I turned out again, called for captain Keat, and said, <Q>What now, Keat, what trick hast thou played now, to put me into a room where there is a man with his naked ra∣pier? What is thy end in this?</Q> 'Oh,' said he, <Q>pray hold your tongue; for if you speak to this man, we cannot all rule him, he is so devilish.</Q> 'Then,' said I, <Q>dost thou put me into a room where there is such a man with a naked rapier, that thou say'st, You cannot all rule him? What an unworthy, base trick is this? and to put me single into this room from the rest of my friends, that were fellow-prisoners with me?</Q> Thus his plot was discovered, and the mischief they intended was prevented. Afterward we got another room, where we were together all night; and in the evening we declared the truth to the people: but they were dark and hardened. The soldiers, notwith∣standing their fair promises, were very rude and wicked to us again, and sat up drinking and roaring all night.</P>
<P>Next day we were brought to Lanceston, where captain Keat delivered us to the gaoler. Now was there no friend, nor friendly people near us; and the people of the town were a dark, hardened people. The gaoler required us to
<PB N="221" REF="037441_0298_100D8FC4B75C6CA0"/>pay seven shillings a week for our horse-meat, and seven shillings a week for our diet apiece. After some time seve∣ral sober persons came to see us, and some of the town were convinced; and many friendly people out of several parts of the country came to visit us, and were convinced. Then got up a great rage among the professors and priests against us. They said, This people Thou and Thee all men with∣out respect, and will not put off their hats, nor bow the knee to any man; but we shall see, when the assize comes, whether they will dare to Thou and Thee the judge, and keep on their hats before him. They expected we should be hanged at the assize. But all this was little to us; for we saw how God would stain the world's honour and glo∣ry; and were commanded not to seek that honour, nor give it; but knew the honour that cometh from God only, and sought that.</P>
<P>It was nine weeks from the time of our commitment to the assizes, to which abundance of people came from far and near to hear the trial of the Quakers. Captain Brad∣den lay with his troop of horse there, whose soldiers and the sherisf's men guarded us to the court through the multitude that filled the streets; and much ado they had to get us through. Besides, the doors and windows were filled with people looking upon us. When we were brought into the court, we stood a pretty while with our hats on, and all was quiet; and I was moved to say, <Q>Peace be amongst you?</Q> Judge Glyn, a Welshman then chief justice of England, said to the gaoler, <Q>What be these you have brought here into the court?</Q> 'Prisoners, my lord,' said he. 'Why do you not put off your hats?' said the judge to us. We said nothing. 'Put off your hats.' said the judge again. Still we said nothing. Then said the judge, 'The court commands you to put off your hats.' Then I queried, <Q>Where did ever any magistrate, king, or judge, from Moses to Daniel, command any to put off their hats, when they came before them in their courts, either amongst the Jews (the people of God) or amongst the heathen? And if the law of England doth command any such things, shew me that law either written or print∣ed.</Q> The judge grew very angry, and said. <Q>I do not carry my law-books on my back.</Q> 'But,' said I. <Q>tell me where it is printed in any statute-book, that I may read it.</Q> Then said the judge, <Q>Take him away, prevaricator! I'll serk him.</Q> So they took us away, and put us among
<PB N="222" REF="037441_0299_100D8FC73453CC38"/>the thieves. Presently after he called to the gaoler. <Q>Bring them up again! Come,</Q> said he, <Q>where had they hats from Moses to Daniel? Come, answer me; I have you fast now.</Q> I replied, <Q>Thou mayest read in the third of Daniel, that the three children were cast into the fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's command, with their coats, their hose, and their hats on.</Q> This plain instance stop∣ped him; so that not having any thing else to the point, he cried again, 'Take them away, gaoler.' Accordingly we were taken away, and thrust in among the thieves; where we were kept a great while; and then, without being called again, the sheriff's men and the troopers made way for us to get through the crowd, and guarded us to prison again, a multitude of people following us, with whom we had much discourse and reasoning at the gaol. We had some good books to set forth our principles, and to inform people of the truth; which the judge and justices hearing of, they sent captain Bradden for them, who came and vio∣lently took our books from us, some out of Edward Pyot's hands, and carried them away; so we never get them again.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we were had up again into the chamber by the gaoler, sheriff's men, and troopers; who had a mighty toil to get us through the crowd of people. When we were in the court, waiting to be called, observing the jurymen, and such a multitude of others swearing, it griev∣ed my life to see, that such as professed christianity should so openly disobey and break the command of Christ and the apostle. And I was moved of the Lord to give forth a paper against swearing, which I had about me, to the grand and petty juries.</P>
<P>Concerning SWEARING.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TAKE heed of giving people oaths to swear: for 'Christ our Lord and Master saith, <Q>Swear not at all; but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</Q> If any was to suffer death, it must be by the hand of two or three witnesses; and the hands of the witnesses were to be first upon him to put him to death. The apostle James saith, <Q>My brethren, above all things swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, lest ye fall into condemnation.</Q> Hence ye may see
<PB N="223" REF="037441_0300_100D8FCA1D0A18E8"/>those that swear fall into condemnation, and are out of Christ's and the apostle's doctrine. Every one of you have a light from Christ, who saith, <Q>I am the light of the world,</Q> and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. He saith, "Learn of me," whose doc∣trine, and that of the apostle, is not to swear; <Q>Let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay, in all your com∣munication; for whatsoever is more cometh of evil:</Q> they that go into more than yea and nay go into evil, and are out of the doctrine of Christ. If you say, <Q>That the oath was the end of controversy and strife;</Q> those who are in strife are out of Christ's doctrine; for he is the covenant of peace, and who are in that, are in the co∣venant of peace. The apostle brings that but as an ex∣ample: as men swearing by the greater, and the oath was the end of controversy and strife among men; saying, Verily, men swear by the greater: but God having no greater swears by himself concerning Christ; who, when he was come, taught not to swear at all. So those who are in him, and follow him, cannot but abide in his doc∣trine. If you say, <Q>They swore under the law, and under the prophets;</Q> Christ is the end of the law, and of the prophets, to every one that believeth for righteousness sake. Now mark, <Q>If you believe, I am the light of the world, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> saith Christ, by whom it was made; now every man of you that is come into the world is en∣lightened with a light that comes from Christ, by which the world was made, that all of you through him might believe, that is the end for which he doth enlighten you. Now if you do believe in the light, as Christ commands, "Believe in the light, that you may be children of light;" you believe in Christ, and learn of him, who is the way to the Father. This is the light which shews the evil ac∣tions you have all acted, the ungodly deeds you have committed, the ungodly speeches you have spoken; and all your oaths, cursed speaking, and ungodly actions. If you hearken to this light, it will let you see all that you have done contrary to it; and loving it, it will turn you from your evil deeds, evil ways, and evil words, to Christ, who is not of the world; but is the light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and testifies against the world, that the deeds thereof are evil. So doth the light in every man, received from him, testify against all
<PB N="224" REF="037441_0301_100D8FCC0F2048B0"/>evil works, that they are contrary to the light; and each shall give an account, at the day of judgment, for every idle word that is spoken. This light shall bring every tongue to consess, yea and every knee to bow, at the name of Jesus: in which light, if you believe, you shall not come into condemnation, but to Christ, who is not of the world, to him by whom it was made: but if you believe not in the light, this is your condemnation.</P>

<P>This paper passing among them from the jury to the justices, they presented it to the judge; so when we were called before the judge, he bid the clerk give me that paper, and then asked me, Whether that seditious paper was mine? I told him, <Q>If they would read it up in open court that I might hear it, if it was mine, I would own it, and stand by it.</Q> He would have had me to have taken it, and looked upon it in my own hand; but I again desired, <Q>That it might be read, that all the country might hear it, and judge whether there was any sedition in it or no; for if there was. I was willing to suffer for it.</Q> At last the clerk of the assize read it with an audible voice, that all the people might hear it. When he had done, I told them, <Q>It was my paper. I would own it; and so might they too, except they would deny the scripture: for was not this scripture language, the words and commands of Christ and the apostle, which all true christians ought to obey?</Q> Then they dropped that subject; and the judge sell upon us about our hats again, bidding the gaoler take them off; which he did; and giving them to us, we put them on again. We asked the judge and justices, <Q>What we had lain in prison for these nine weeks, seeing they now ob∣jected nothing to us but about our hats?</Q> And as for putting off our hats, I told them, <Q>That was the honour which God would lay in the dust, though they made so much ado about it; the honour which is of men, and which men seck one of another, and is a mark of unbe∣lievers,</Q> For "How can ye believe," faith Christ. <Q>who receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th from God only?</Q> Christ saith. <Q>I receive not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from men;</Q> and all true christians should be 'of his mind.' Then the judge began to make a pompous speech, how he represented the lord Protector's person, who made him lord chief juslice of England, and sent him to
<PB N="225" REF="037441_0302_100D8FCDA2126D68"/>come that circuit, &amp;c. <Q>We desired him then, that he would do us justice for our false imprisonment which we had suffered nine weeks wrongfully.</Q> But instead of that, they brought an indiciment framed against us; so full of hes, that I thought it had been against some of the thieves, <Q>That we came by force and arms, and in a hostile man∣ner into the court;</Q> who were brought as aforesaid. I told them, <Q>It was all false; and still we cried for justice for our false imprisomment, being taken up in our journey without cause by major Caedy.</Q> Then Peter Ceely said to the judge, <Q>May it please you, my lord, this man (point∣ing to me) went aside with me, and told me how service∣able I might be for his design; that he could raise forty thousand men at an hour's warning, involve the nation in blood, and so bring in king Charles. I would have aided him out of the country, but he would not go. If it please you, my lord, I have a witness to swear it.</Q> So he called upon his witness; but the judge not being forward to ex∣amine the witness, I desired, <Q>That he would be pleased to let my mittimus be read in the sace of the court and coun∣try, in which my crime was signified for which I was sent to prison.</Q> The judge said, It should not be read. I said, <Q>It ought to be, seeing it concerned my liberty and my life.</Q> The judge said again. It shall not be read. I said, <Q>It ought to be read; for if I have done any thing worthy of death, or of bonds, let all the country know it.</Q> Then seeing they would not read it, I spoke to one of my fellow∣prisoners. 'Thou hast a copy of it, read it up said I.' It shall not be read, said the judge; gaoler, take him away. I'll see whether he or I shall be master. So I was taken away, and awhile after called for again. I still called to have the mittimus read; for that signified the canse of my commitment. I again spoke to the friend, my follow-pri∣soner, to read it up; which he did, and the judge, justices, and the whole court were silent; for the people were eager to hear it. It was as followeth:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When it was read I spoke thus to the judge and justices, <Q>Thou that sayest thou art chief justice of England, and you justices, know that, if I had put in sureties, I might have gone whither I pleased, and have carried on the de∣sign (if I had had one) which major Ceely hath charged me with. And if I had spoken those words to him, which he hath here declared, judge ye whether bail or mainprize could have been taken in that case.</Q> Then, turning my speech to major Ceely, I said, <Q>When or where did I take thee aside? Was not thy house full of rude people, and thou as rude as any of them, at our examination; so that I asked for a constable or some other officer to keep the people civil? But if thou art my accuser, why sittest thou on the bench? It is not the place of accusers to sit with the judge. Thou oughtest to come down and stand by me, and look me in the face. Besides, I would ask the judge and justices, Whether or no major Ceely is not guilty of this treason, which he charges against me in con∣cealing it so long as he hath done? Does he understand his place, either as a soldier or a justice of the peace? For he tells you here, <Q>That I went aside with him, and told him what a design I had in hand, and how service∣able he might be for my design: that I could raise forty thousand men in an hour's time, bring in king Charles,
<PB N="227" REF="037441_0304_100D8FD26330BA60"/>and involve the nation in blood.</Q> He saith moreover, <Q>He would have aided me out of the country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed me to prison for want of sureties for the good behaviour,</Q> as the mittimus declares. Now do you not see plainly, that major Ceely is guilty of this plot and treason he talks of, and hath made himself a party to it, by desiring me to go out of the country, demanding bail of me, and not charging me with this pretended treason till now, nor discovering it? But I deny and abhor his words, and am innocent of his de∣vilish design.</Q> So that business was let fall; for the judge saw clear enough, that instead of ensnaring me, he had en∣snared himself.</P>
<P>Major Ceely got up again, and said, <Q>If it please you, my lord, to hear me: this man struck me, and gave me such a blow as I never had in my life.</Q> At this I smiled in my heart, and said, <Q>Major Ceely, art thou a justice of peace, and a major of a troop of horse, and tellest the judge in the face of the court and country, that I, a pri∣soner, struck thee, and gave thee such a blow as thou ne∣ver hadst the like in thy life? What! art thou not ashamed? Prithee, major Ceely, said I, where did I strike thee? and who is thy witness for that? who was by? He said, It was in the Castle-green, and captain Bradden was standing by when I struck him. I desired the judge to let him produce his witness for that; and call∣ed again upon major Ceely to come down from the bench, telling him, It was not fit the accuser should sit as judge over the accused.</Q> When I called again for his witness, he said captain Bradden was his witness. Then I said, <Q>Speak, captain Bradden, didst thou see me give him such a blow, and strike him as he saith?</Q> Captain Bradden made no answer, but bowed his head towards me. <Q>I de∣sired him to speak up, if he knew any such thing; but he only bowed his head again. Nay, said I, speak up, and let the court and country hear; let not bowing of the head serve the turn. If I have done so, let the law be inflicted on me; I fear not sufferings, nor death itself, for I am an innocent man concerning all his charge.</Q> But captain Bradden never testified to it. The judge, finding those snares would not hold, cried, Take him away, gaoler; and when we were taken away, he fined us twenty marks apiece for not putting off our hats; to be kept in prison till we paid it; and sent us back to the gaol.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="037441_0305_100D8FD4F5A7D700"/>
At night captain Bradden came to see us, and seven or eight justices with him who were very civil to us, and told us, They believed, neither the judge nor any in the court gave credit to those charges which major Ceely had accused me of in the face of the country. And captain Bradden said, Major Ceely had an intent to have taken away my life, if he could have got another witness. <Q>But said I, Captain Bradden, why didst not thou witness for me, or against me. seeing major Ceely produced thee for a wit∣ness that thou sawest me strike him? When I desired thee to speak either for me or against me, according to what thou sawest or knewest, thou wouldst not speak.</Q> Why, said he, when major Ceely and I came by you, as you were walking in the Castle-green, he put off his hat to you, and said. How do you, Mr. Fox? your servant, Sir, Then you said to him, Major Ceely, take heed of hypocri∣sy and of a rotten heart; for when came I to be thy master, and thou my servant? Do servants use to cast their masters into prison? This was the great blow he meant that you gave him. Then I called to mind that they walked by us, and that he spoke so to me, and I to him; which hypocrisy and rotten-heartedness he manifested openly, when he com∣plained of this to the judge in open court, and in the face of the country; whom he would have made believe that I struck him with my hand.</P>
<P>Now were we kept in prison, and divers came from far and nigh to see us, of whom some were people of account in the world; for the report of our trial was spread abroad, and our boldness and innocency in our answers to the judge and court was talked of in the town and country. Among others Humphry Lower came to visit us, a grave, sober, ancient man, who had been a justice of peace, and was ve∣ry sorry we should lie in prison; telling us, how serviceable we should be if we were at liberty. We reasoned with him concerning swearing: and having acquainted him they tendered the oath of abjuration to us as a snare, because they knew we could not swear; and shewed him, that no people could be serviceable to God if they disobeyed the command of Christ; and that they that imprisoned us for the hat-honour, which was of men, and which men sought for, they prisoned the good, and grieved the Spirit of God in themselves, which should have turned their minds to him. So we directed him to the Spirit of God in his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, the light of Christ Jesus: and he was thoroughly convinced,
<PB N="229" REF="037441_0306_100D8FD68EA86930"/>and continued so to his death, and became very serviceable to us.</P>
<P>There came also to see us, one colonel Rouse, a justice of peace, and a great company with him. He was full of words and talk, as ever I heard any man in my life, so that without intruding, there was no speaking to him. At length I asked him, <Q>Whether he had ever been at school, and knew what belonged to questions and answers?</Q> (this I said to slop him.) At school! said he, yes. At school! said the soldiers; Doth he say so to our colonel, that is a scholar? Then said I, <Q>If he be so, let him be still and re∣ceive answers to what he hath said.</Q> Then I was moved of the Lord to speak the word of life to him in God's dread∣ful power; which came so over him that he could not open his mouth. His face swelled, and was red like a turkey. His lips moved, and he mumbled something; but the peo∣ple thought he would have fallen down. I stept to him; and then he said, He was never so in his life before; for the Lord's power stopped the evil power and air in him, so that he was almost choked. The man was ever after ve∣ry loving to friends, but not so full of airy words to us; though he was full of pride: but the Lord's power came over him, and the rest that were with him.</P>
<P>Another time there came an officer of the army, a very malicious, bitter professor, whom I had known in London. He was full of airy talk also, and spoke slightly of the light of Christ, and against the truth, as colonel Rouse had done, and against the Spirit of God being in men, as it was in the apostles days, till the power of God that bound the evil in him had almost choked him also, as it did colonel Rouse; for he was so full of evil air, that he could not speak; but blubbered and stuttered. From that time that the Lord's power struck him, and came over him, he was ever after more loving to us.</P>
<P>The assizes being over, and we settled in prison upon such a commitment that we were not likely to be soon re∣leased, we broke off from giving the gaoler seven shillings a week apiece for our horses, and, seven shillings a week for ourselves, and sent our horses into the country. Upon which he grew very wicked and devilish, and put us down into Doomsdale, a nasty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linking place, where they used to put murderers after they were condemned. The place was so noisome, that it was observed few that went in did ever come out again in health. There was no house of
<PB N="230" REF="037441_0307_100D8FD89C4C7608"/>office in it; and the excrement of the prisoners, that from time to time had been put there, had not been carried out (as we were told) for many years. So that it was all like mire, and in some places to the top of the shoes in water and urine; and he would not let us cleanse it, nor suffer us to have beds or straw to lie on. At night some friendly people of the town brought us a candle and a little straw; and we went to burn a little of our straw to take away the stink. The thieves lay over our heads, and the head-gaol∣er in a room by them over our heads also. It seems the smoke went up into the room where the gaoler lay; which put him into such a rage that he took the pots of excrement from the thieves, and poured them through a hole upon our heads in Doomsdale, till we were so bespattered that we could not touch ourselves nor one another. And the slink increased upon us; so that what with stink, and what with smoke, we had like to have been choked and smother∣ed. We had the stink under our fect before, now we had it on our heads and backs also; and he having quenched our straw with the filth he poured down, had made a great smother in the place. Moreover he railed at us most hide∣ously, calling us hatchet-faced dogs, and such strange names as we had never heard of. In this manner we were obliged to stand all night, for we could not sit down, the place was so full of filthy excrement. A great while he kept us after this manner before he would let us cleanse it, or suffer us to have any victuals brought in but what we got through the grate: One time a girl brought us a little meat; and he arrested her for breaking his house, and sued her in the town-court for breaking the prison. A great deal of trouble he put the young woman to; whereby others were so dis∣couraged that we had much ado to get water, drink, or vic∣tuals. Near this time we sent for a young woman, Ann Downer, from London, who could write and take things well in short-hand, to buy and dress our meat for us; which she was very willing to do, it being also upon her spirit to come to us in the love of God; and she was very service∣able to us.</P>
<P>The head-gaoler, we were informed, had been a thief, and was burnt both in the hand and in the shoulder: his wise too had been burnt in the hand. The under∣gaoler had been burnt both in the hand and in the shoul∣der: his wise had been burnt in the hand also. Colonel Bennet, a baptist-teacher, having purchased the gaol and
<PB N="231" REF="037441_0308_100D8FDA39791E98"/>lands belonging to the castle, had placed this head-gaoler there. The prisoners and some wild people would be talk∣ing of spirits that haunted Doomsdale, and how many had died in it, thinking perhaps to terrify us therewith. But I told them, <Q>That if all the spirits and devils in hell were there, I was over them in the power of God, and feared no such thing; for Christ, our Priest, would sanctify the walls of the house to us, he who bruised the head of the devil.</Q> The priest was to cleanse the plague out of the walls of the house under the law, which Christ, our Priest, ended; who sanctifies both inwardly and outwardly the walls of the house, the walls of the heart, and all things to his people.</P>
<P>By this time the general quarter-sessions drew nigh; and the gaoler still carrying himself basely and wickedly towards us, we drew up our suffering case, and sent it to the sessions at Bodmin. Upon the reading of which the justices gave order. <Q>That Doomsdale-door should be opened, and that we should have liberty to cleanse it, and to buy our meat in the town.</Q> We sent up a copy also of our sufferings to the Protector, setting forth how we were taken and com∣mitted by major Ceely, and abused by captain Keat as aforesaid, and the rest in order. Whereupon the Protector sent an order to captain Fox, governor of Pendennis-castle; to examine the matter about the soldiers abusing us, and striking me. There were at that time many of the gentry of the country at the castle; and captain Keat's kinsman, that struck me, was sent for before them, and much threat∣ened. They told him, <Q>If I should change my principle, I might take the extremity of the law against him, and might recover sound damages of him.</Q> Captain Keat was also check'd for suffering the prisoners under his charge to be abused. This was of great service in the country; for afterwards friends might have spoken in any market or stee∣ple-house thereabouts, and none would meddle with them. I understood that Hugh Peters, one of the Protector's chaplains, told him, <Q>They could not do George Fox a greater service for the spreading of his principles in Corn∣wall than to imprison him there.</Q> And indeed my impri∣sonment there was of the Lord, and for his service in those parts; for aftere the assizes were over, and it was known we were likely to continue prisoners, several friends from most parts of the nation came into the country to visit us, Those parts of the west were very dark countries at that
<PB N="232" REF="037441_0309_100D8FDC5381E198"/>time; but the Lord's light and truth broke forth, shined over all, and many were turned from darkness to light, and from satan's power unto God. Many were moved to go to the steeple-houses, several were sent to prison to us, and a great convincement began in the country: for now we had liberty to walk in the Castle-green, and divers came to us on first-days, to whom we declared the word of life. Great service we had, many were turned to God up and down the country; but great rage got up in the priests and professors against the truth and us. One of the envious professors had gathered together many scripture-sentences to prove, <Q>That we ought to put off our hats to the peo∣ple,</Q> and he invited the town of Lanceston to come into the Castle-yard to hear him read them. Amongst other instances that he brought, one was, <Q>That Saul bowed to the witch of Endor.</Q> When he had done we got a little liberty to speak, and shewed both him and the people, <Q>That Saul was gone from God, and had disobeyed him, like them, when he went to the witch of Endor: that neither the prophets, nor Christ, nor the apostles ever taught people to bow to a witch.</Q> The man went away with his rude people; but some staid with us, and we shewed them, That this was not gospel-instruction, to teach people to bow to a witch. For now people began to be affected with the truth, and the devil's rage increased; so that we were often in great danger.</P>
<P>One time there came a soldier, and while one of our friends was admonishing and exhorting him to sobriety, &amp;c. I saw him begin to draw his sword. Whereupon I stept to him, and represented what a shame it was to offer to draw his sword upon a naked man, and a prisoner, and how unfit and unworthy he was to carry such a weapon; and that, if he should have offered such a thing to some men, they would have taken his sword from him and have bro∣ken it to pieces. So he was ashamed and went his way; and the Lord's power preserved us.</P>
<P>Another time, about eleven at night, the gaoler being half drunk, came and told me, He had got a man now to dispute with me (this was when we had leave to go a little into the town.) As soon as he spoke these words, I felt there was mischief intended to my body. All that night and the next day I lay down on a grass-plat to slumber, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> something still about my body; and I started up, and struck at it in the power of the Lord, and still it was
<PB N="233" REF="037441_0310_100D8FDED37500B8"/>about my body. Then I rose and walked into the Castle∣green, and the under-keeper came and told me, There was a maid would speak with me in the prison. I felt a snare in his words too, therefore I went not into the prison, but to the grate; and looking in, I saw a man that was lately brought to prison for being a conjurer, who had a naked knife in his hand. I spoke to him, and he threaten∣ed, to cut my chaps; but being within the gaol he could not come at me. This was the gaoler's great disputant. I went soon after into the gaoler's house, and found him at breakfast; he had then got his conjurer out with him. I told the gaoler, his plot was discovered. Then he got up from the table, and cast his napkin away in a rage; and I left them, and went away to my chamber; for at this time we were out of Doomsdale. At the time the gaoler had said the dispute should be, I went down and walked in the court (the place appointed) till about the eleventh hour; but no∣body came. Then I went up to my chamber again; and after awhile heard one call for me. I stepped to the stairs∣head, where I saw the gaoler's wife upon the stairs, and the conjurer at the bottom of the stairs, holding his hand behind his back, and in a great rage. I asked him, <Q>Man, what hast thou in thy hand behind thy back?</Q> <Q>Pluck thy hand before thee,</Q> said I; 'let's see thy hand, and 'what thou hast in it? Then he angrily plucked forth his hand with a naked knise in it. I shewed the gaoler's wife their wicked design against me; for this was the man they brought to dispute of the things of God. But the Lord discovered their plot, prevented their evil design; and they both raged, and the conjurer threatened. Then I was moved of the Lord to speak sharply to him in the dreadful power of the Lord; and the Lord's power came over him, and bound him down; so that he never after durst appear before me, to speak to me. I saw it was the Lord alone that preserved me out of their bloody hands; for the devil had a great enmity to me, and stirred up his instruments to seek my hurt. But the Lord prevented them; and my heart was filled with thanksgivings and praises to him.</P>
<P>Now while I was exercised with people of divers sorts, that came some out of good-will to visit us, some out of an envious carping mind to wrangle and dispute wish us, and some out of curiosity to see us; Edward Pyot, who before his convincement had been a captain in the army, and had a good understanding in the laws and rights of the people,
<PB N="234" REF="037441_0311_100D8FE0D5E4FB00"/>being sensible of the injustice and envy of judge Glyn to us at our trial, and willing to lay the weight thereof upon him, and make him sensible thereof also, wrote an epistle to him, on behalf of us all, which was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To John Glyn, chief justice of England:</SALUTE>
<SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are freemen of England, free-born; our rights and liberties are according to law, and ought to be defended by it; therefore, with thee, by whose hand we have so long suffered, and yet do suffer, let us a little plainly reason concerning thy proceedings against us, whe∣ther they have been according to law, and agreeable to thy duty and office, as chief minister of the law or justice of England? And in meekness and lowliness abide, that the witness of God in thy conscience may be heard to speak and judge in this matter: for thou and we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Therefore, friend, in moderation and so∣berness weigh what is herein laid before thee.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, before we were brought before thee at the assize at Lanceston, thou didst cause divers scores of our books to be violently taken from us by armed men without due process of law; which books being perused, to see if any thing in them could have been found to have been laid to our charge (who were innocent men, and then upon our legal issue) thou hast detained from us to this very day. Our books are our goods, our goods are our property, and our liberty it is to have and enjoy our property: and of our liberty and property the law is the defence; which saith, <Q>No freeman shall be disseized of his freehold, liberties, or free customs, &amp;c. nor any way otherwise destroyed: nor we shall not pass upon him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land, Magna Charta, cap. 29.</Q> Now, friend, consider, is not the taking away of a man's goods violently, by force of arms, as aforesaid, contrary to the law of the land? Is not the keeping of them, so taken away, a disseizing him of his property, and a destroying of it and his liberty, yea, his very being, so far as the invading of the guard the law sets about him is in order thereunto? Calls not the law this a destroying of a man? Is there any more than
<PB N="235" REF="037441_0312_100D8FE3D4F34800"/>one common guard or defence to property, liberty, and life, viz. the law? And can this guard be broken on the former, viz. property and liberty, and the latter, viz. life, be sure? Doth not he, that makes an invasion upon a man's property and liberty (which he doth, who, contrary to law, which is the guard, acts against either) make an inva∣sion upon a man's life; since that which is the ground of the one is also of the other? If a penny or penny's worth be taken from a man contrary to law, may not by the same rule all a man hath be taken away? If the bond of the law be broken upon a man's property, may it not on the same ground be broken upon his person? And by the same rea∣son as it is broken on one man, may it not be broken upon all, since the liberty, property, and beings of all men under a government are relative, a communion of wealth, as the members in the body, but one guard and defence to all, the law? One man cannot be injured therein, but it redounds to all. Do not such things tend to the subversion and dis∣solution of government? Where there is no law, what is become of government? And of what value is the law made, when the ministers thereof break it at pleasure upon men's properties, liberties, and persons? Canst thou clear thyself of these things, as to us? To that of God in thy conscience, which is just, do I speak. Hast thou acted like a minister, the chief minister of the law, who hast taken our goods, and yet detainest them, without so much as going by lawful warrant, grounded upon due information, which in this our case thou couldst not have; for none had perused them, whereby to give thee information? Shouldest thou exercise violence and force of arms on prisoners goods, in their prison-chamber, instead of proceeding orderly and legally, which thy place calls upon thee above any man to tender, defend, and maintain against wrong, and to pre∣serve intire the guard of every man's being, liberty, and livelihood? Shouldst thou, whose duty it is to punish the wrong-doer, do wrong thyself? Who oughtest to see the law be kept and observed, break the law, and turn aside the due adininistration thereof? Surely, from thee, consider∣ing thou art chief justice of England, other things were expected, both by us and by the people of this nation.</P>
<P>And friend, when we were brought before thee and stood upon our legal issue, and no accuser or accusation came in against us, as to what we had been wrongfully imprisoned for, and in prison detained for the space of nine weeks,
<PB N="236" REF="037441_0313_100D8FE568050A78"/>shouldest not thou have caused us to have been acquitted by proclamation? Saith not the law so? Oughtest thou not to have examined the cause of our commitment, and there not appearing a lawful cause, to have discharged us? Is it not the substance of thy office and duty, to do justice according to the law and custom of England? Is not this the end of the administration of the law? of the general assizes? of the gaol-deliveries? of the judges go∣ing the circuits? Hast not thou, by doing otherwise, acted contrary to all these, and to Magna Charta? which, Cap. 29. saith, <Q>We shall sell to no man, we shall deny or defer to no man, either justice or right.</Q> Hast thou not both deferred and denied to us, who had been so long oppressed, this justice and right? And when of thee justice we demanded, saidst thou not, <Q>If we would be uncovered, thou wouldst hear us, and do us justice?</Q> —<Q>We shall self to no man, we shall deny or defer to no man either justice or right,</Q> saith Magna Charta as afore∣said: again, <Q>We have commanded all our justices, that they shall from henceforth do even law, and execu∣tion of right to all our subjects, rich and poor, without having regard to any man's person; and without letting to do right for any letters or commandments which may come to them from us, or from any other, or by any other cause, &amp;c. upon pain to be at our will, body, lands and goods, to do therewith as shall please us, in case they do contrary,</Q> saith Stat. 20 Edw. III. Cap. 1. Again, <Q>Ye shall swear, that ye shall do even law and execution of right to all, rich and poor, without having regard to any person; and that ye deny to no man common right by the king's letters, nor none other man's, nor for none other cause. And in case any letter come to you contrary to the law, that ye do nothing by such letter; but certify the king thereof, and go sorth to do the law notwithstand∣ing those letters. And in case ye be from henc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>forth sound in default in any of the points aforesaid, ye shall be at the king's will of body, lands and goods, thereof to be done, as shall please him:</Q> saith the oath appointed by the statute to be taken by all the judges, Stat. 18 Ed. III. But none of these, nor any other law, hath such an expression or condition in it as this. <Q>Provided he will put off his hat to you, or be uncovered.</Q> Nor doth the law of God so say, or that your persons be re∣spected; but the contrary. From whence then comes
<PB N="237" REF="037441_0314_100D8FE78FAF0F78"/>this new law, <Q>If ye will be uncovered, I will hear you, and do you justice?</Q> This hearing complaint of wrong, this doing of justice, upon condition; wherein lies the equity and the reasonableness of that? When were these fundamental laws repealed, which were the issue of so much blood and war; which to uphold, cost the miseries and blood of the late wars, that we shall now be heard, as to right, and have justice done us but upon condition, and that too such a trifling one as the putting off the hat? Doth thy saying so, who art commanded, as aforesaid, re∣peal them, and make them of no effect, and all the mise∣ries undergone, and the blood shed for them of old and of late years? Whether it be so or not indeed, and to the nation, thou hast made it so to us; to whom thou hast denied the justice of our liberty when we were before thee, and no accuser nor accusation came in against us, and the hearing of the wrong done to us who are innocent, and the doing us right. And bonds hast thou cast and conti∣nued upon us until this day, under an unreasonable and cruel gaoler, for not performing that thy condition, for conscience sake. But thinkest thou that this thine own conditional justice maketh void the law? or can it do so? or absolve thee before God or man? or acquit the penalty mentioned in the laws aforesaid? unto which hast thou not consented and sworn? viz. <Q>And in case ye be from henceforth found in default in any of the points aforesaid, ye shall be at the king's will, of body, lands, and goods, thereof to be done as shall please him.</Q> And is not thy 'saying. <Q>If ye will be uncovered (or put off your hats) I will hear you, and do you justice;</Q> and because we could not put them off for conscience-sake, thy denying us justice, and refusing to hear us, as to wrong, who had so unjustly suffered, a default in thee against the very es∣sence of those laws, yea, an overthrow thereof, for which things sake (being of the highest importance to the well∣being of men) so just, so equal, so necessary those laws were made, and all the provisions therein? To make a default in any one point of which provisions, exposeth to the said penalty. Dost not thou by this time see where thou art? Art thou sure thou shalt never be made to understand and feel the justice thereof? Is thy seat so high, and thy fence so great, and art thou so certain of thy time and station, above all that have gone before thee, whom justice hath cut down, and given them their due,
<PB N="238" REF="037441_0315_100D8FE9846221A0"/>that thou shalt never be called to an account, nor with its long and sure stroke be reached? Deceive not thyself, God is come nearer to judgment than the workers of iniquity in this age imagine, who persecute and evil-intreat those that witness the Just and Holy One, for their witnessing of him, who is come to reign for ever and ever. Saith he not, he will be a swist witness against the false swearers? God is not mocked.</P>
<P>Surely friend, that must needs be a very great offence, which deprives a man of justice, of being heard as to wrong, of the benefit of the law, and of those laws afore-rehearsed; to defend the justice and equity of which, a man hath adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red his blood and all that is dear to him. But to stand covered (or with the hat on) in conscience to the command of the Lord, is made by thee such an of∣fence (which is none in law) and rendered upon us (who are innocent, serving the living God) effectual to de∣ny us justice; though the laws of God, and of man, and the oath, and equity and reason say the contrary, and on it pronounceth such a penalty. <Q>If ye will be uncovered (Uncovered, saidst thou) I will hear you, and do you justice:</Q> but justice we had not, nor were we heard, be∣cause Jesus, Christ, who is the higher power, the lawgiver of his people, in our consciences commanded us not to respect persons; whom to obey we choose rather than man. And for our obedience unto him hast thou cast us into pri∣son, and continuest us there, till this very day; having shewed us neither law for it, not scripture, nor instances of either, nor examples of heathens or others. Friend, Come down to that of God, that is just in thee, and consider, was there ever such a thing as this heard of in this nation? What is become of seriousness, of true judgment, and of righteousness! An unrighteous man, standing before thee with his hat off shall be heard; but an innocent man ap∣pearing with his hat on in conscience to the Lord, shall neither he heard, nor have justice. Is not this regarding of persons contrary to the laws aforesaid, and the oath, and the law of God? Understand, and judge. Did we not own authority and government oftentimes before the count? Didst thou not say in the court, Thou wast glad to hear so much from us of our owning magistracy? Pleaded we not to the indictment, though it was such a new-found one as England never heard of before? Came we not when thou sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st for us? Went we not when thou bidst us go?
<PB N="239" REF="037441_0316_100D8FEB44144020"/>And are we not still prisoners at thy command and at thy will? If the hat had been such an offence to thee, couldst thou not have caused it to have been taken off, when thou heardst us so often declare, we could not do it in consci∣ence to the commands of the Lord; and that for that cause we forbore it, not in contempt of thee, or of authority, nor in disrespect to thine or any man's person (for we said, we honoured all men in the Lord, and owned authority, which was a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well; and our souls were subject to the higher powers for conscience sake) as thou causedst them to be taken off, and to be kept so, when thou calledst the jury to find us transgressors without a law? What ado hast thou made to take away the righteousness of the righteous from him, and to cause us to suffer further, whom thou knewest to have been so long wrongfully in prison contrary to law? Is not liberty of conscience a natural right? Had there been a law in this case, and we bound up in our consciences that we could not have obeyed it, was not liberty of conscience there to take place? For where the law saith not against, there needs no plea of liberty of conscience: but the law have we not offended; yet in thy will hast thou caused, and dost thou yet cause us to suffer for our consciences, where the law requires no such thing: and yet for liberty of conscience hath all the blood been spilt, and the mise∣ries of the late wars undergone, and, as the protector saith, this government undertaken, to preserve it; and a na∣tural right, he saith, it is; and he that would have it, he saith, ought to give it. And if it be a natural right, as is undeniable, then to attempt to force it, or to punish a man for not doing contrary to it, is to act against nature: which as it is unreasonable, so it is the same as to offer violence to a man's life. And what an offence that is in the law, thou knowest; and how, by the common law of England, all acts, agreements and laws, that are against nature, are mere nullities: and all the judges cannot make one case to be law, that is against nature. But put the case, our standing with our hats on had been an offence in law, and we wilfully, and in contempt, and not out of conscience had stood so (which we deny) yet that is not a ground wherefore we should be denied justice, or to be heard, as to the wrong done to us. <Q>If ye will not offend in one case, I will do you justice in another:</Q> this is not the language of the law, or of justice, which distributes to eve∣ry
<PB N="240" REF="037441_0317_100D8FEDD1993FC0"/>one their right; justice, to whom justice is due; pu∣nishment, to whom punishment is due. A man who doth wrong, may also have wrong done to him; shall he not have right, wherein he is wronged, unless he right him whom he hath wronged? The law saith not so; but the wrong-doer is to suffer, and the sufferer of wrong to be righted. Is not otherwise to do, a denying, a letting or stopping of even law, and execution of justice, and a bringing under the penalties aforesaid? Mind and consider.</P>
<P>And shouldst thou have accused, when no witness ap∣peared against us, as in the particulars of striking Peter Ceely, and dispersing books (as thou saidst) against ma∣gistracy and ministry, with which thou didst falsely accuse one of us? Saith not the law, <Q>The judge ought not to be the accuser?</Q> much less a false accuser. And wast thou not such an one, in affirming, that he dispersed books against magistracy and ministry, when the books were violently taken out of our chamber, undispersed by him, or any of us? Nor didst thou make it appear in one particular, wherein those books, thou so violently didst cause to be taken away, were against magistracy or minis∣try; or gavest one instance or reply, when he denied what thou chargedst therein; and spoke to thee to bring forth those books, and make thy charge appear. Is not the sword of the magistrate of God to pass upon such evil-do∣ing? And according to the administration of the law, ought not accusations to be by way of indictment, wherein the offence is to be charged, and the law expressed, against which it is? Can there be an issue without an indictment? Or can an indictment be found, before proof be made of the offence charged therein? And hast not thou herein gone contrary to the law, and the administration thereof, and thy duty, as a judge? What just cause of offence gave George Fox to thee, when, upon thy producing a paper concerning swearing, sent by him (as thou saidst) to the grand jury, and requiring him to say, Whether it was his hand-writing? he answered, <Q>Read it up before the country; and when he heard it read, if it were his, he would own it?</Q> Is it not equal, and according to law, that what a man is charged with before the country, should be read in the hearing of him and of the country? When a paper is delivered out of a man's hand, altera∣tions may be made in it to his prejudice, which, on a sud∣den looking over it, may not presently be discerned; but
<PB N="241" REF="037441_0318_100D8FF03445B2D8"/>by hearing it read up, may be better understood whether any such alterations have been made therein? Couldst thou in justice have expected, or required him otherwise to do? Considering also, that he was not insensible how much he had suffered already, being innocent; and what endea∣vours there were used to cause him further to suffer? Was not what he said a plain and single answer, and sufficient in the law? Though (as hath been demonstrated) contrary to law thou didst act, and to thy office, in being his ac∣cuser therein, and producing the paper against him. And in his liberty it was, whether he would have made thee any answer at all to what thou didst exhibit, or demand out of the due course of law: for to the law answer is to be made; not to thy will. Wherefore then wast thou so filled with rage and fury upon that his reply? Calmly, and in the fear of the Lord consider: Wherefore didst thou revile him, particularly with the reproachful names of jug∣gler and prevaricator? Wherein did he juggle? Wherein did he prevaricate? Wherefore didst thou use such threat∣ening language, and such menacings to him and us, say∣ing, Thou wouldst ferk us, with such like? Doth not the law forbid reviling, and rage, and fury, and threatening and menacing of prisoners? Soberly mind; is this to act like a judge, or a man? Is not this transgression? Is not the sword of the magistrate of God to pass on this as evil-doing, which the righteous law condemns, and the higher power is against, which judgeth for God? Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: <Q>Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed, and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts,</Q> said Jehoshaphat to the judges of Judah. Pride, and fury and passion, and rage, and reviling, and threatening are not the Lord's: these, and the principle out of which they spring, are for judg∣ment, and must come under the sword of the magistrate of God; and of an ill favour, especially such an expres∣sion, as to threaten to ferk us. Is not such a saying more becoming a pedant, or schoolmaster with his rod or ferula in his hand, than thee, who art the chief justice of the nation, who sittest in the highest seat of judgment; who oughtest to give a good example, and so to judge, that others may hear and fear? Weight it soberly and consider, Doth not threatening language demonstrate an inequality
<PB N="242" REF="037441_0319_100D8FF22A8400B0"/>and partiality in him who sits as a judge? Is it not a de∣terring of a prisoner from standing to and pleading the innocency of his cause? Provides not the law against it? Saith it not. That irons and all other bonds shall be taken from the prisoner, that he may plead without amazement, and with such freedom of spirit as if he were not a pri∣soner? But when he, who is to judge according to the law, shall beforehand threaten and menace the prisoner contrary to the law, how can the mind of the prisoner be free, to plead his innocency before him? or expect equal judgment from him, who before he hears him, threatens what he will do to him? Is not this the case between thee and us? Is not this the measure we have received at thy hands? Hast thou herein dealt according to law? or to thy duty? or as thou wouldst be done unto? Let that of God in thy conscience judge.</P>
<P>And didst not thou say, there was a law for putting off the hat; and that thou wouldst shew a law? and didst not thou often so express thyself? But didst thou produce any law? or shew where that law might be found? or any judicial precedent, or in what king's reign, when we so often desired it of thee? having never heard of or known any such law, by which thou didst judge us. Was not what we demanded of thee reasonable and just? Was that a savoury answer, and according to law, which thou gavest us, <Q>I am not to carry the law-books at my back, up and down the country; I am not to instruct you?</Q> Was ever such an expression heard before these days to come out of a judge's mouth? Is he not to be of counsel in the law for the prisoner, and to instruct him therein? Is it not for this cause that the prisoner, in many cases, is not allowed counsel by the law? In all courts of justice in this nation, hath it not been known so to have been? And to the prisoner hath not this been often declared, when he hath demanded counsel, alleging his ignorance in the law, by reason of which his cause might miscarry, though it were righteous, viz. <Q>The court is of counsel for you?</Q> Ought not he, that judgeth in the law, to be expert in the law? Couldst not thou tell by what act of 'parliament it was made, or by what judicial precedent, or in what king's reign, or when it was adjudged so by the common law (which are all the grounds the law of En∣gland hath) had there been such a law, though the words of the law thou couldst not remember? Surely, to inform
<PB N="243" REF="037441_0320_100D8FF4DB1F92B0"/>the prisoner when he desired it, especially as to a law which was never heard of, by which he proceeds to judge him, that he may know what law it is by which he is to be judged, becomes him who judgeth for God: for so the law was read to the Jews, by which they were to be judg∣ed, yea every sabbath-day; this was the commandment of the Lord. But instead thereof to say, <Q>I am not to carry the law books at my back up and down the country; I am not to instruct you:</Q> To say, "There is a law," and to say, "Thou wilt shew it;" and yet not shew it, nor to tell where it is to be found; consider whether it be con∣sistent with savouriness, truth, or justice?</P>
<P>Have not thy whole proceedings against us made it evidently to appear that thy desire was to cause us to suffer, not to deliver us, who being innocent, suffered; to have us aspersed and reproached before the country, not to have our innocency cleared and vindicated? Doth not the taking away our books as aforesaid, and the pe∣rusing of them in such haste before our trial, and thy ac∣cusing us with something which thou saidst was contained in them, make it appear that matter was sought out of them wherewithal to charge us, when the Et Cetera war∣rant would not stand in law by which we were committed, and were then upon our delivery according to the due course of law? Doth it not further appear, by thy refu∣sing to take from our hands a copy of the strange Et Cetera warrant by which we were committed, and of the paper for which we stood apprehended, to read it or cause it to be read; that so our long sufferings by reason of both might be looked into, and weighed in the law, whether just or righteous, and the country might as well see our innocency and sufferings without a cause, and the manner of dealing with us, as to hear such reports which went of us as great offenders, when we called upon thee often so to do, and which thou oughtest to have done, and saidst, Thou wouldst do, but didst it not; nor so much as took notice before the country that we had been falsely imprisoned, and had wrongfully suffered? But what might asperse and charge us thou broughtest in thyself, contrary to law, and didst call to have us charged therewith. Is not this further manifest, in that thou didst cause us on a sudden to be withdrawn, and the petty jury to be called in with their verdict; whereupon Peter Ceely's falsely accusing George Fox <Q>with telling him privately of a design, and
<PB N="244" REF="037441_0321_100D8FF77654CC58"/>persuading him to join therein.</Q> was by George Fox made so clear to be a manifest falsehood, and so plainly to be perceived, that the cause of our sufferings was not any evil we had done, or law that we had transgressed, but malice and wickedness? And is it not abundantly clear from thy not permitting us to answer, and clear our∣selves of the many foul slanders charged upon us in the new-found indictment, of which no proof was made? But when we were answering thereunto, and clearing our∣selves thereof, thou didst stop us, saying, <Q>Thou mindedst not those things, but only the putting off the hat:</Q> when as before the country the new-found indictment charged us with those things, and the petty jury brought in their verdict, <Q>Guilty of the crespasles and contempts montion∣ed therein;</Q> of which (except as to the hat) not one wit∣ness or evidence was produced; and as to the hat, not any law or judicial precedent, upon the transgression of which all legal indictments are to be grounded? Now the law seeks not for causes whereby to make the innocent suffer; but helpeth him to right who suffers wrong, re∣lieveth the oppressed, and searcheth out the matter, Whe∣ther that of which a man stands accused be so or no; seeking judgment and hastening righteousness: and it saith, "The innocent and the righteous slay thou not," But whether thou hast done so to us, or the contrary, let the witness of God in thee search and judge; as these thy fruits do also make manisest.</P>
<P>And, friend, consider how abominably wicked, and how highly to be abhorred, denied, and witnessed against, and how contrary to the laws such a proceeding is, as to charge a man with many offences in an indictment, which they who draw the indictment, they who prosecute, and they who find the bill, know to be false, and to be put in purposely to reproach and wound his good name; whom, with some sinall matter which they can prove, they charge and indict, as is the common practice at this day. Prove but one particular charge in the indictment, and it must stand (say they) for a true bill; though there be ne∣ver so many salsehoods and lies therein, on set purpose to wrong him who is maliciously prosecuted: this is known to the judges, and almost to every man who hath to do with and attends their courts. How contrary is this to the end and righteousness of the law, which clears the innocent and condemns the guilty, and condemneth not
<PB N="245" REF="037441_0322_100D8FF90B477768"/>the righteous with the wicked! Much it is cried out of; but what reformation is there thereof? How else shall clerks of assize, and other clerks of courts fill up their bags (out of which perhaps their master must have a secret consideration) and be heightened in pride and impudence; that even in open court they take upon them to check and revile men without reproof, when a few lines might serve instead of an hundred? How else shall the spirit that is in men, that lusteth unto envy, malice, strife, and contention, be cherished and nourished, to feed the law∣yers and dependants on courts with the bread of men's children and the ruin of their families, to maintain their long suits and malicious contentions! For a judge to say, <Q>I mind not these things; I'll not hear you; clear your∣selves of what you are falsely accused of: one thing I mind in your charge, the rest are but matter of form, set there to render you such wicked men before the country, as the thing that is to be proved against you is not suf∣ficient to make out.</Q> Oh! abominable wickedness, and perverting of the righteous end of the law, which is so careful and tender of every man's peace and innocency! How is the law in the administration thereof adulterated by the law∣yers, as the scriptures are man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by the priests! And that which was made to preserve the righteous, and to punish the wicked, perverted to the punishing of the right∣eous and the preserving of the wicked! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, life for life, burning for burning, wound for wound, a stripe for a stripe; he that accuseth a man falsely, to suffer the same as he should have suffer∣ed who was falsely accused, if he had been guilty. This saith the righteous law of God; which is agreable to that of God in every man's conscience. Are not such forms of iniquity to be denied, which are so contrary to the law of God and man? Which serve for the gender∣ing of strife, and the kindling of contention? And of this nature was not that, with which thou didst cause us to be indicted? And this form didst not thou uphold, in not permitting us to answer to the many foul slanders therein; saying, "Those things thou mindedst not?" Will not the wrath of God be revealed from heaven against all un∣godliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; who are so far from the power of god∣liness, that they have not the form, but the form of ini∣quity, which is set up and held up instead of and as a
<PB N="246" REF="037441_0323_100D8FFA9F98DA18"/>law, to overthrow and destroy the righteousness of the righteous, and so to shut him up as by the law he can never get out? Is not the cry, thinkest thou, gone up? <Q>It is time for thee to set to thine hand, O Lord, for thine enemies have made void thy law!</Q> Draws not the hour nigh? Fills not up the measure of iniquity apace? Surely the day is coming, and hasteneth. Warned ye have been from the presence, and by the mouth of the Lord; and clear will he be when he cometh to judgment, and upright when he giveth sentence. That of God in every one of your consciences shall so to him bear witness and confess, and your mouths shall be stopped, and be∣fore your judge shall ye be silent, when he shall divide you your portion, and render unto you according to your deeds. Therefore, whilst thou hast time, prize it, and repent: for verily, <Q>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people; and the heavens shall declare his righte∣ousness: for God is judge himself. Consider this, ye that forget God, lest he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</Q></P>
<P>And, friend, shouldst thou have given judgment against us (wherein thou didst fine us twenty marks a-piece, and imprisonment till payment) without causing us, being pri∣soners, to be brought before thee, to hear the judgment, and to move what we had to say in arrest of judgment? Is not this contrary to the law, as is manifest to those who understand the proceedings thereof? Is not the prisoner to be called before judgment be given? And is not the in∣dictment to be read? and the verdict thereupon? And is not liberty to be given him to move in arrest of judgment? And if it be a just exception in the law, ought not there to be an arrest of judgment? For the indictment may not be drawn up according to law, and may be wrong placed, and the offence charged therein may not be a crime in law; or the jury may have been corrupted or menaced, or set on by some of the justices; with other particulars, which are known to be legal and just exceptions. And the judgment ought to be in the prisoner's hearing, not behind his back; as if the judge were so conscious of the error thereof, that he dares not give it to the face of the prisoner. But these privileges of the law, this justice we
<PB N="247" REF="037441_0324_100D8FFD2FBB3D00"/>(who had so long and so greatly suffered contrary to law) received not, nor could have at thy hands; no, not so much as a copy or sight of that long and new-found in∣dictment (which in England was never heard of before, nor that the matter contained therein was an offence in law, nor ever was there any law or judicial precedent that made it so) though two friends of ours, in our names and behalfs, that night, the next day, and the day following often desired it of the clerk of the assize, and his assistant and servants; but they could not have it, nor so much li∣berty as to see it. And it is like it was not unknown or unperceived by thee, that, had we been called as we ought to have been, or had known when it was to be giv∣en, three or four words might have made a sufficient legal arrest of the judgment given on that new-found indictment, and the verdict thereupon. Therefore as our liberties, who are innocent, have not in thy account been worth the minding, and esteemed fit for nothing but to be trampled under foot and destroyed; so, if we find fault with what thou hast done, thou hast taken care that no door be left open to us in the law, but a writ of error: the considera∣tion whereof, and the judgment to be given thereon, is to be had only where thyself is chief; of whom such com∣plaint is to be made, and the error assigned for the reverse of thy judgment. And what the fruit of that may be well expected to be, by what we have already mentioned as having received at thy hands, thou hast given us to un∣derstand. And here thou mayst think thou hast made thyself secure and sufficiently barred up our way of relief, against whom (though thou knewest we had done nothing contrary to the law or worthy of bonds, much less of the bonds and sufferings we had sustained) thou hast proceeded, as hath been rehearsed; notwithstanding that thou art, as are all the judges of the nation, intrusted not with a legis∣lative power, but to administer justice, and to do <Q>even law and execution to all, high and low, rich and poor, without having regard to any man's person;</Q> and art sworn so to do; and wherein thou dost contrary art liable to punishment, as ceasing from being a judge, and becom∣ing a wrong doer and an oppressor; which what it is to be many of thy predecessors have understood, some by death, others by fine and imprisonment. And of this thou mayst not be ignorant, that to deny a prisoner any of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣leges the law allows him, is to deny him justice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

</LETTER>
<P>By this letter the reader may observe how contrary to law we were made to suffer; but the Lord, who saw the integri∣ty of our hearts to him, and knew the innocency of our cause, was with us in our sufferings, bore up our spirits, and made them easy to us; and gave us opportunities of publishing his name and truth amongst the people: so that several of the town came to be convinced, many were made loving to us, and friends from divers parts came to visit us; amongst whom were two out of Wales, who had been jus∣tices of peace. Judge Hagget's wife, of Bristol, came to visit us, who was convinced, with several of her children; and her husband was very kind and serviceable to friends, and had a great love to God's people, which he retained to his death.</P>
<P>In Cornwall, Devonshire, Dorsetshire, and Somerset∣shire, truth began mightily to spread; many were turned to Christ Jesus and his free teaching: for many friends that came to visit us were drawn to declare the truth in those
<PB N="249" REF="037441_0326_100D900112D85B28"/>counties; which made the priests and professors rage, and they stirred up the magistrates to ensnare friends. They set up watches in the streets and highways, on pretence of taking up suspicious persons; under which colour they stop∣ped, and took up friends coming to visit us in prison; which they did, that they might not pass up and down in the Lord's service. But that which they thought to have stopped the truth by, was the means of spreading it so much the more; for then friends were frequently moved to speak to one constable, and t'other officer, and to the justices they were brought before; which caused the truth to spread the more in all their parishes. And when friends were got among the watches, it would be a fortnight or three weeks before they could get out of them again; for no sooner had one constable taken and carried them before the justices, and they had discharged them, but another would take them up and carry them before other justices: which put the country to a great deal of needless trouble and charges.</P>
<P>As Thomas Rawlinson was coming out of the north to visit us, a constable in Devonshire took him up; and at night took twenty shillings out of his pocket: and after being thus robbed he was cast into Exeter gaol. They cast Henry Pollexfen also into prison in Devonshire, under pre∣tence of his being a jesuit; who had been a justice of peace for the most part of forty years before. Many friends were cruelly beaten by them; nay some clothiers that were but going to mill with their cloth, and others about their out∣ward occasions, they took up and whipped; though men of about eighty or an hundred pounds by the year, and not above four or five miles from their families.</P>
<P>The mayor of Lanceston took up all he could, and cast them into prison. He would search substantial grave wo∣men, their petticoats and their head-cloaths. A young man coming to see us, I drew up all the gross, inhuman, and unchristian actions of the mayor, gave it him, and bid him seal it up, and go out again the back way; and then come into the town through the gates. He did so, and the watch took him up, and carried him before the mayor; who pre∣sently searched his pockets and found the letter; wherein he saw all his actions characterized; which shamed him so, that from that time he meddled little with the Lord's servants.</P>
<P>From the sense I had of the snare that was laid, and mis∣chief intended in setting up those watches at that time to
<PB N="250" REF="037441_0327_100D9002A4591978"/>stop and take up friends, it came upon me to give forth the following lines, as—</P>
<P>An exhortation and warning to the magistrates.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL ye powers of the earth, Christ is come to reign, and is among you, and ye know him not; who doth enlighten every one of you, that ye all through him might believe in him; who is the light, who treads the wine∣press alone without the city, and whose feet are upon it. Therefore see all, and examine with the light what ye are ripe for; for the press is ready for you.</P>
<P>Before honour is humility. You that would have ho∣nour before ye have humility, are ye not as the heathen are? Ye would have honour before ye have humility; did not all the persecutors that ever were upon the earth want this humility? They wanted the honour, and yet would have the honour before they had the humility, and had learned that. So ye that are out of humility, are out of the honour, and ye are not to have the honour who have not the humility; for before honour is humility: mark, before it.</P>
<P>Ye pretend liberty of conscience, yet one shall not carry a letter to a friend, nor men visit their friends, nor visit prisoners, nor carry a book about them, either for their own use or for their friends. Men shall not see their friends; but watches are set up against them to catch and stop them: and these must be well armed too against an innocent people, that have not so much as a stick in their hands, who are in scorn called Quakers. Yet by such as set up these watches is pretended liberty of conscience; who take up them whose consciences are exercised towards God and men, who worship God in spirit and truth; which they that are out of the light call heresy. These set up watches against those they in scorn call Quakers, because they confess and witness the true light, that light∣eth every one that cometh into the world, amongst people as they pass through the country, or among their friends. This is the dangerous doctrine which watchmen are set up against, to subdue error, as they call it, which is the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world; him by whom the world was made, who was glorified with the Father before the world began. For those whom they in scorn call Quakers, have they set up their watch∣es,
<PB N="251" REF="037441_0328_100D90054A472E08"/>able men, well armed, to take them up that bear this testimony either in words, books, or letters. So that is the light you hate, which enlightens every man that com∣eth into the world; and these that witness to this light you put in prison; and after you have imprisoned them, you set up your watches to take all up that go to visit them, and to imprison them also: so that by setting up your watches, ye would stop all relief from coming to prison∣ers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord God to you, and a charge to you all, in the presence of the living God of heaven and earth: every man of you being enlighten∣ed with a light that cometh from Christ, the saviour of people's souls; to this light, all take heed, that with it you may see Christ from whom the light cometh, you may see him to be your Saviour by whom the world was made, who saith, Learn of me. But if ye hate this light, ye hate Christ who doth enlighten you all, that through him you might believe. But not believing in the light, nor bringing your deeds to the light, which will make them manifest and reprove them, this becomes your condemner, even the light. Remember you are warned in your life∣time; for this light is your way to salvation, if you walk in it; and this light is your condemner, if you reject and hate it. You can never come to Christ, the Second Priest, until you come to the light which the Second Priest hath enlightened you withal. So ye that come not to the light, ye go to the priests that take tithes, as did the first priest∣hood; and so hale out of your synagogues and temples as that priesthood did which took tithes: which those of the second priesthood did not. Was there ever such a gene∣ration! Or did ever such a generation of men appear as doth now in this age, who are so full of madness, envy, and persecution, that they stand up in watches, with bills and weapons, against the truth, to persecute it, as the towns and countries declare; which rings as Sodom, and like Gomorrah! And this hath its liberty, and truth is stood against; to reprove sin is accounted a breach of the peace, as those say who are out of the truth, and set up their watches against it.</P>

<P>Besides this general warning, there coming to my hand a copy of a warrant issued from the sessions of Exon, in express terms, "For apprehending of all Quakers;" where∣in truth and friends were reproached and vilified; I was
<PB N="252" REF="037441_0329_100D9007A621A090"/>moved to write an answer thereunto, and send it abroad, for the clearing of truth and friends from the slanders therein cast upon them: and to manifest the wickedness of that persecuting spirit from whence it proceeded; which was after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>WHEREAS there was a warrant granted the last sessions holden at Exon, on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, 1656, which warrant is <Q>For the appre∣hending and taking up all such as are Quakers, or call themselves Quakers, or go under the notion of Quakers;</Q> 'and is directed to the chief constables, to be sent by them to the petty constables, requiring them to set watch∣es, able men with bills, to take up all such Quakers as aforesaid; and whereas in your said warrant you speak of the Quakers spreading seditious books and papers; I answer, They, whom ye in scorn call Quakers, have no seditious books or papers; but their books are against se∣dition, and seditious men, seditious books, seditious teach∣ers, and seditious ways. Thus ye have numbered honest men, godly men, holy men, men that fear God, among beggars, rogues, and vagabonds; putting no difference between the precious and the vile. You are not fit to judge, who have set up your bills, and armed your men to stand up together in battle against innocent people, the lambs of Christ, who have not lifted up an hand against you. But if ye were sensible of the state of your own country, your cities, your towns, your villages, how the cry of them is like Gomorrah, the ring like Sodom, and the sound like the old world, where all flesh had corrupted its way, which God overthrew with the flood; if you did consider this with yourselves, you would find some∣thing to turn the sword against, and not against the lambs of Christ, and not make a mock of the innocent, that stand a witness against all sin and unrighteousness in your towns and steeple-houses. Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, was grieved with the filthy conversation of the wicked: so are we now. Just Lot was grieved with their-unmerciful deeds, and the filthy conver∣sation of Sodom. And were not these hated of the world, and of them that lived in filthiness? And whereas you speak of those you in scorn call Quakers, that they are a grief to those whom you call pious and religious people, and their religion; such as are in the religion that is vain, whose
<PB N="253" REF="037441_0330_100D90093829BF20"/>tongues are not bridled, I believe the Quakers are a grief to; but are not a grief to such as are in the pure religion, which keepeth unspotted of the world; which sets not up bills, nor watches, to maintain it by the world; for they are not of the world, who are in the pure religion, which keeps them unspotted of the world: mark, the <Q>pure religion, which keeps unspotted of the world.</Q> But such as are in the religion that is not pure, who have a form of godliness, and not the power, such as you call pious, the truth itself to such was always a grief; and so it is in this age. And now your fruits appear, the end of your reli∣gion and profession, and what you possess; but you are in the error, and have been but in the profession, out of the possession of the Spirit, who are not in the Spirit of truth. For where did that ever set bounds, and number the just and innocent with the wicked? But the wicked set bounds and limits to the just, and numbered them among the wicked; yea, all manner of evil they spoke of them, as ye are doing now of us. According as it was foretold in the scripture, such as tremble at the word of God, you cast out and hate, you that have your temple-worship. You say, the Quakers come to disturb you in your churches. Was it not the practice of the apostles to go into the syna∣gogues and temples, to witness against the priesthood that took tythes? Was it not the practice of the Jews to hale them out, persecute them, and stone them, that witnessed Christ the second priest, and went to bring people off from the first priesthood? Was it not the practice of the prophets to go and cry against the high places? And was it not the practice of the Jews, when they were back-slid∣den, and of the heathen, to imprison and persecute the prophets, and send after them into other countries? Is not this your practice now, who are holding up your high places erected by the Papists, which ye now call your churches; where ye beat and persecute? What kind of re∣ligious people are you, that are filled with so much mad∣ness? Did not Paul confess he was mad while he was in your practice, haling, beating, prisoning, putting out of the synagogues, having his authority from the chief priests? And are not the chief priests the cause of this? Was there ever such a cry made in any age past, as there is now in the pulpits, railing against an innocent people, who lift not up an hand against you; and who are indeed the pi∣ous, that are of the pure religion, who fear God, and
<PB N="254" REF="037441_0331_100D900B2C15C440"/>worship him in the Spirit and in the truth, but cannot join with you in your religion? Do not the ministers of God say, that the scriptures are a declaration, which you call the word? Do not you rob Christ of his title, and of his honour, and give it to the letter, and shew yourselves out of the doctrine of the ministers of God, who called the scriptures by the name of writings and treatises, and declarations; and said, Christs name is called the Word of God? Are not you here in the error you speak of, which is common talk among you? There was talk among some of you of your gospel-shining. Doth the gos∣pel persecute? Did ever any of those that did possess it cast into prison, and not suffer others to visit them? Are you like Christians in this, or like heathen, who set bounds and watches over the land, that they should not pass to visit those in prison? Was ever the like heard in any age? Search and see, if you have not outstript them all in your watches, if not in your manner of persecution, and in your imprisonments. Oh! never talk that we are a grief to them that are in the pure religion.</P>
<P>And whereas in your warrant we are represented as disaf∣fected to government; I say, the law, that is a terror to the evil-doer, we own; the higher power, to which the soul must be subject; but we deny the evil-doer, the malicious man reigning, and the envious man seeking for his prey, whose envy is against the innocent; who raiseth up the country against honest men, and so becomes a trouble to the coun∣try, in raising them up to take the innocent: but that we leave to the Lord to judge. Your false accusations of heresy and blasphemy we deny. You should have laid them down in particulars, that people might have seen them; and not have slandered us behind our backs. The law saith, The crime should be mentioned in the warrant. Then for your saying. <Q>We deny the godly ministers to be a true ministry of Christ;</Q> that is false; for we say, The godly ministers are the ministers of Christ. But which of your ministers dare say that they are cruly godly? And for your charging us with seducing many weak peo∣ple, that is false also; we seduce none. But you, that deny the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, are seduced from the anointing which should teach you; and if ye would be taught by it, ye would not need that any man should teach you. But such as are taught by the anointing which abideth in them, and deny
<PB N="255" REF="037441_0332_100D900CE4582748"/>man's teaching, these ye call seducers, quite contrary to John's doctrine, 1. Joh. 2. That which is truth, ye call seducing; and that which he calls seducing, you call truth. Read the latter part of the chapter. I warn you all from the Lord God of glory, set not any bound against him. Limit not the Holy One of Israel; for the Lord is rising in power and great glory, who will rule the nations with a rod of iron, which to him are but as the drop of a buck∣et. He that measures the waters in the hollow of his hand, will dash nations together as a potter's vessel. And know, you that are found in this his day blaspheming his work which he hath brought forth, calling it blasphemy, fighting against it, setting up your carnal weapons, making your bonds strong; God will break asunder that which your carnal policy hath invented, and which by your car∣nal weapons ye would uphold, and make you know there is a God in heaven, who carries his lambs in his arms, which are come among wolves, and are ready to be torn in pieces in every place, yea, in your steeple-houses; where people have appeared without reason and natural affection. Therefore all ye petty constables, sheriffs, and justices, take warning; take heed what ye do against the lambs of Christ; for Christ is come, and coming, who will give to every one of you a reward according to your works, you that have the letter, which speaks of Christ; who are persecuting that which the scripture speaks of: so your fruits make you manifest. Therefore every one, sheriffs, justices, constables, &amp;c. consider what ye possess, and what a profession ye are now in, that all these carnal weapons are set up against the innocent, yea, against the truth; which shews, that ye have not the spiritual wea∣pons: and that ye want the counsel of Gamaliel, yea, ye want the counsel of such a man among you, who said, <Q>Let the apostles alone: if it be of God, it will stand; if it be not, it will come to nought.</Q> But ye may see yourselves, on the contrary, in the spirit of them that came with Judas, with swords and staves from the chief priests against Christ: still it is against Christ, where he is made manifest. Paul (while Saul) went against him, though he and the Jews professed a Christ that was to come: yet Paul persecuted him, where he was manifested in his saints. So ye profess a Christ that is come, but persecute him where he is manifest. You that have the letter, the high places, the synagogues, you persecute
<PB N="256" REF="037441_0333_100D900F33E1E028"/>him where he is made manifest in his saints, as the Jews did. Those who were in the letter, out of the life, per∣secuted them that were in the life of that which they pro∣fess in the letter: so do you persecute them that are in the life, and are yourselves strangers to it; as your fruits make appear. You have numbered the people of God amongst transgressors; but have you prisoned any of the rogues and transgressors you speak of? You have prisoned the in∣nocent, and let the others go free.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When I had sent abroad the foregoing, so great a sense came upon me of the veil of darkness that was over the priests and professors of christianity, that I was moved to give forth the following, as an awakening warning to them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>BLINDNESS hath happened to the professed chris∣tians of the letter now-a-days, as blindness happen∣ed to the Jews; who professed the letter, but owned not the life, which the letter speaks of: as the christians now, to whom this blindness hath happened, who profess the scripture, but own not the life which the scripture speaks of. For against the life the Jews stood, who professed the letter of the scripture; but they were blind, they gathered counsel against the life: they were in an uproar, when the babe was born in Bethlehem, Herod and all the chief priests. And Herod sought to destroy all the young chil∣dren in Bethlehem, yet missed the babe; Herod, that fox, though he put John to death. You may see here, how the literal professors stood up, not for the truth, but quite against it. Furthermore, the chief priests consulted together how they might take Jesus by subtilty, and put him to death; mark, by their subtilty. The professors of a Christ that was to come, they preached of a Messias, of a Christ, of a Saviour; but denied the life. When he was made manifest, the chief priests, who were gathered together with the council, said, His disciples had stolen him away by night; and gave large sums of money to the soldiers to declare this. Likewise in the day, when the children of Israel were in Egypt, and they with their children began to spread and multiply, "Come." said the Egyptians. <Q>let us deal wisely with them to afflict them, and tax them:</Q> which held till the Lord overthrew their oppressors, and brought his seed by his mighty power from under the oppressor, and exalted his son above all;
<PB N="257" REF="037441_0334_100D9011206DE528"/>though the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things. He made his power known, that all might see that there was no God upon the earth but himself. This power now hath brought forth the work of the Lord! Many, who are turned to the light, Christ, have received the power of God, and are thereby become the sons of God. Now this birth, that is born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, are the powers of the world joined together to crucify; to put to death those Jews in the Spirit, as they put Christ to death in the flesh formerly. This is the birth that all the wicked world is enraged against. Against this they set their watch∣es, this birth, brought forth by the mighty God of Jacob, who rides upon the high places of the earth. This is the birth that the professed christians without the life in our days rage against, and lay out all their wisdom about. Are not the chief priests and wise men of the earth con∣sulting together how they may destroy this birth? Is not this the birth that is banished out of your hearts, you that profess the scripture, and are talkers of it, but do not own the light and life which the scripture speaks of, as the Jews would not; and so will not have Christ to reign over you, as they would not? Do you not hale out of your synagogues, and before magistrates? Do you not herein fulfil Christ's words, who said to his disciples, They should be haled out of the synagogues, and before rulers? Do you not persecute them from city to city? Do you not almost sill your prisons with them? And now set your watches, that none should visit them, whom you have put into prison? Is not this an unchristian spirit? How can you for shame say, you are upholders of truth? Or how can you for shame say, that truth hath been professed among you? We grant that you have talked of it. And how can you for shame say, <Q>The gospel shines among you,</Q> when you will not own it, the life of it; when you call it error, and the evil seed? Yea, the very truth, the very life of truth ye have blasphemed against now, as the Jews did against Christ, calling him a devil; you now call it error, and the evil seed, and stand up against it, and turn the sword against it. It was the Jews in their days who turned the sword against Christ; so it is in these days the christian professors of the scripture, but out of the life that gave it forth; as those were the Jews outward in the flesh, not the Jews in the Spirit. Is it not a shame to the ministers of the gospel (as they are called) that they
<PB N="258" REF="037441_0335_100D9012F6317190"/>'can find no better way to maintain that which they call the truth, and their gospel, than by carnal weapons, stocks, prisons, whips, watches, and wards, and powers of the earth? Were these the apostles weapons? Carnal watches, stocks, prisons, and halings out of the synagogues, when they came to speak? Judge yourselves, what an antichristian p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it you have. Never talk of defending truth with that which is against truth. For are you not setting up the rabble of the world against it? Do they not join with you, with swords and staves against it? Is this the life of christians? Is not this the life of error, and of the evil seedsman? Surely ye would find work enough, if ye were in the fear of the Lord, to turn your swords against the profaneness, the oaths and wickedness, that are in your streets and highways. How do they ring like Sodom, and give a sound like Gomorrah! But these are become a prey in this age, that reprove in your gate sin, wickedness, and profaneness. They are become your by∣word. Against them your councils are gathered, them you cast into prison, and hale them out of your syna∣gogues: and cast them likewise into prison that write and speak against it; and set your guards to stop and hinder any from visiting them whom you cast into prison, and give them the names of vagabonds and wanderers. Was ever the like heard in the days of the heathen against the apos∣tles, who, witnessed the gospel? Did they set guards and watches in every town, in every city, to take the disciples, the brethren, the believers, that heard the apostles were cast into prison, and came to see what they wanted? Shew ye not as much rage and fury now in your age, as was in those in that age? How can you talk of the gospel, and of defending the gospel, when you are setting guards and watches against it, are defending that which stands against it; and the lambs of Christ are almost torn to pieces amongst you, who are like wolves? for the Lord hath now sent his lambs among wolves. Have not you professed the words of Christ, the prophets and apostles, as the Jews had long professed the scriptures, the words of Moses, and the prophets, that prophesied of Christ then to come; and stood against him when he was come? as you do in this day of his reign, in this day of his glorious gospel, who are persecuting the messengers of it, impri∣soning them, persecuting them in your streets and high∣ways, and setting up your watches against them who bring
<PB N="259" REF="037441_0336_100D9014E7ABDA70"/>the glad tidings of peace to your souls; whose feet are beautiful atop of the mountains; mark, atop of the moun∣tains; that against which the mountains rage and swell; but God will make them to melt; the Sun is risen, which will make them to melt. God will cleave the rocks and mountains asunder, and make the hills to bow perpetual∣ly; for his Son he will exalt, and his glory he will give to him, and not to another. Therefore be awakened, ye rulers of the earth, and take counsel of the Lord. Take not counsel together against him. Make not your bonds strong. Set not yourselves in battle against him: for ye will be found but as briers and thorns before him, which the fire shall consume. Therefore be awakened, all ye talkers of the scripture, that gather yourselves together by your multitudes and meetings, and have had your teach∣ers; but not having the Spirit that gave forth the scrip∣tures, the Lord God of glory, the Father of spirits, will scatter you. All your bonds will not hold you together, who are out of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace. The threshing instrument is gone forth, which will beat the hills to pieces. Sion is risen to thresh. Out of the ho∣ly mountain is the trumpet sounded. Stand not up against the Lord: for all nations are to him as the drop of a buck∣et. He that measures the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighs the earth in scales, the Lord of Hosts is his name, who is now risen and rising, to plead the cause of the innocent, and is exalting his Son, and bringing his sheep to him. Now are they seen and known, that feed upon wind, that are lifted up, given up to believe lies; who report, and say, "Report, and we will report it." Now are they seen, who have a form of godliness, but deny the power: so Christ is denied; for Christ is the power of God. And the power being denied by you, that have a form of godliness, and the words of the scrip∣tures; the gospel is denied: for the gospel is the power of God. Thus it is among you that have the knowledge and wisdom that is sensual, earthly, and devilish. Doth it not appear so? Let your gaols and watches witness your fruits in every town. Your wisdom is earthly, sen∣sual, and devilish. You have a knowledge and wisdom, but not that which is from above; for that is pure and gentle, so is not your knowledge. But to know Christ, is life eternal. Your fruits have manifested, that you are not of this; and so out of the power of God, which
<PB N="260" REF="037441_0337_100D901736A46F10"/>is the cross of Christ; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the cross of Christ, persecuting. So that which doth persecute, and send forth writings and decrees to stop and take up all, and set watches, and prepare bonds to limit the Lord; to im∣prison and persecute, and suffer none to go and visit them: this shews you are not christians, but stand against the christian life, which brings to love enemies. Where is your love to your enemies who are thus persecuting your friends? <Q>He came to his own, and his own re∣ceived him not.</Q> Here is a turning the sword against the just. Do you shew here a christian's life, or yourselves christians, who are filling your gaols with the christians in the Spirit, you that are in the letter (in shadows) as the Jews in the letter did, put the Jews in the Spirit into prison? Is not this the fruit in our days of christians in the letter, to put christians in the Spirit into prison? Doth not this shew that your decrees, which you have sent forth, proceed from death, who thus act against the life, and them that are in it; which the scriptures were given forth from? Is it not here, as it was with Saul, when he went to persecute, to hale to prison, and bind all that he could sind calling upon that name, who were christians in the life, the Spirit, such as you are persecuting, because they are in the life, though you profess their words? Are not your decrees gone forth from the same spirit of envy, against the same Spirit of Christ they were in? Is it not manifest to all that fear God, and to the sober-minded and honest-hearted people, that see your practices, your decrees, your letters, to stop, to molest, to hinder, to imprison them that are moved of the Lord to do his will, or to go to visit prisoners whom you have imprisoned? Doth this shew you to have a spirit like Paul, yea, or nay? Are you not quite contrary, like them that persecuted Paul? The day hath declared it. To that of God in you all I speak, which shall witness it at the last day, the day of judgment. Persecution was blind in all ages; and mad∣ness and folly led it: yet persecution got always a form or pretence of godliness, a talk of religion, as in the days of Moses, of Jeremy, of Christ, and of the apostles. "Come," saith the council, <Q>let us crush them while they are young, they have almost overspread the nation in every corner.</Q> This is as much as to say. <Q>Let us put this birth to death, as Pharaoh and Herod did the chil∣dren.</Q>
<PB N="261" REF="037441_0338_100D9019264D6B80"/>But the Lord caused his truth the more to spread. For you may read what numbers came out of Egypt! and what multitudes followed Christ! Therefore with consi∣deration read these lines, and not with fury. Let not fool∣ishness appear; but consider in humility the paths you go in, what spirit you are of, and what the end of your conversation is; for in love to your souls I write, that in the day of your visitation you may consider it.</P>
<P>From him who loveth righteousness, and the esta∣blishing of it, and truth, peace, and faith, which is by Christ Jesus (Mercy and peace be multiplied among such!) But a witness against all hypocrites, and all who have a profession, but live out of the possession; in an hypocritical religion, in the lusts and fashions of the world, having a form of godli∣ness, but standing against the power with might and main, sword and staff. Which things declare your conversation and practices to be out of Christ's life against the gospel practice, and contrary to the manner and order of the saints.</P>

<P>We were continued in prison till the next assize; before which divers friends, both men and women, were sent to prison, who had been taken by the watches. When the assize was come, several of these were called before the judge, and indicted: and though the gaoler brought them into court, yet they indicted them, that they came in 'by force of arms, and in an hostile manner;' and the judge sined them, because they would not put off their hats. But we were not called before the judges any more.</P>
<P>Great work we had, and service for the Lord, both be∣tween the assizes, and after, amongst professors and people of all sorts: for many came to see us, and to reason with us. Elizabeth Trelawny of Plymouth (daughter of one called a baronet) being convinced, the priests, professors, and some great persons of her kindred, were exasperated, and wrote letters to her. She being a wise and tender woman, and fearing to give them any advantage, sent their letters to me; which I answered, and returned them to her again, for her to send the answers to them. Which she did: till growing in the power, Spirit, and wisdom of God, she be∣came able to answer the wisest priest and professor of them
<PB N="262" REF="037441_0339_100D901AD5AD9750"/>all; and had dominion over them in the truth, through the power of the Lord, by which she was kept faithful to her death.</P>
<P>While I was in prison here, the Baptists and Fifth mo∣narchy-man prophesied. That this year Christ should come, and reign upon earth a thousand years. And they looked upon this reign to be outward: when he was come inwardly in the hearts of his people, to reign and rule; where these professors would not receive him. So they failed in their prophecy and expectation, and had not the possession of him. But Christ is come, and doth dwell and reign in the hearts of his people. Thousands, at the door of whose hearts he hath been knocking, have opened to him; and he is come in, and doth sup with them, and they with him; the heavenly supper with the heavenly and spiritual man. So many of these Baptists and Monarchy∣people turned the greatest enemies to the followers of Christ: but he reigns in the hearts of his saints over all their envy.</P>
<P>At the assize divers justices came to us, and were pretty civil, and reasoned of the things of God soberly; expres∣sing a pity to us. Captain Fox, governor of Pendennis Castle, came and looked me in the sace, and said never a word; but went to his company, and told them, <Q>He ne∣ver</Q> saw a simpler man in his life. I called after him and said, 'Stay, man, we will see who is the simpler man.' But he went his way. A light chaffy person.</P>
<P>Thomas Lower also came to visit us, and offered us money, which we refused; accepting nevertheless of his love. He asked us many questions concerning our deny∣ing the scriptures to be the word of God; concerning the sacraments, and such like: to all which he received satis∣faction. I spoke particularly to him; and he afterwards sud. My wars were as a slash of lightning, they ran so through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He said. He never met with such men in his life, for they knew the thoughts of his heart; and were as the wise master-builders of the assemblies, that faslened their words like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He came to be convinced of the truth, and remans a friend to this day. When he came home to his aunt Hembley's, where he then lived, and mode report to her concerning us; she, with her sister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, hearing the report of truth, came to visit us in prison, and was convinced also. Great sufferings and
<PB N="263" REF="037441_0340_100D901D6BA7F2F8"/>spoiling of goods both he and his aunt have undergone for the truth's sake.</P>

<P>IN the power of life and wisdom, and dread of the Lord God of life, and heaven and earth, dwell; that in the wisdom of God over all ye may be preserved, and be a terror to all the adversaries of God, and a dread, answer∣ing that of God in them all, spreading the truth abroad, awakening the witness, confounding the deceit, gathering up out of transgression into the life, the covenant of light and peace with God. Let all nations hear the sound by word or writing. Spare no place, spare no tongue, nor pen; but be obedient to the Lord God: go through the work; be valiant for the truth upon earth; tread and trample upon all that is contrary. Ye have the power, do not abuse it; and strength and presence of the Lord; eye it, and the wisdom; that with it you may all be ordered to the glory of the Lord God. Keep in the dominion; keep in the power over all deceit; tread over them in that, which lets you sec to the world's end, and the utmost parts of the earth. Reign and rule with Christ, whose sceptre and throne are now set up, whose dominion is over all to the ends of the earth; whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, his throne an everlasting throne, his kingdom an everlasting kingdom, his power above all powers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord to you all: "Keep in the wisdom of God," that spreads over all the earth; the wisdom of the creation, that is pure from above, not destructive. For now shall salvation go out of Zion, to judge the mount of Esau; now shall the law go forth from Jerusalem, to answer the principle of God in all; to hew down all inventors and inventions. For all the princes of the earth are but as air to the pow∣er of God, which you are in, and have tasted of: there∣fore live in it, that is the word of the Lord to you all; do not abuse it; keep down and low; and take heed of false joys, that will change.</P>
<P>Bring all into the worship of God. Plow up the fallow ground. Thresh and get out the corn; that the seed, the wheat, may be gathered into the barn: that to the begin∣ning all people may come; to Christ, who was before the
<PB N="264" REF="037441_0341_100D901F59A59510"/>world was made. For the chaff is come upon the wheat by transgression. He that treads it out is out of transgres∣sion, fathoms transgression, puts a difference between the precions and the vile, can pick out the wheat from the tares, and gather into the garner; so brings to the lively hope the immortal soul into God, out of which it came. None worship God but who come to the principle of God, which they have transgressed. None are plowed up but he who comes to the principle of God in him, that he hath transgressed. Then he doth service as to God; then is the planting, watering, and increase from God. So the ministers of the Spirit must minister to the Spirit that is in prison, which hath been in captivity in∣every one; that with the Spirit of Christ people may be led out of captivity up to God, the Father of Spirits, to serve him, and have unity with him, with the scriptures, and one with another. This is the word of the Lord to you all, a charge to you all in the presence of the living God; Be patterns, be examples in all countries, places, islands, nations, where-eyer you come; that your life and conduct may preach among all sorts of people, and to them. Then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in every one; whereby in them ye may be a blessing, and make the witness of God in them to bless you: then to the Lord God you shall be a sweet savour, and a blessing.</P>
<P>Spare no deceit. Lay the Sword upon it; go over it. Keep yourselves clear of the blood of all men, either by word or writing, and keep yourselves clean, that you may stand in your throne, and every one have his lot and stand in the lot in the Ancient of days. The blessing of the Lord be with you, and keep you over all the idolatrous worships and worshippers. Let them know the living God; for teachings, churches, worships. must be thrown down with the power of the Lord God, set up by man's carthly understanding, knowledge, and will. All this must be thrown down with that which gave forth the scrip∣ture; and who are in that, reign over it all. That is the word of the Lord to you all. In that is God worshipped, that brings to declare his will, and brings to the church in God, the ground and pillar of truth: for now is the mighty day of the Lord appeared, and the arrows of the Almighty gene forth; which shall stick in the hearts of the wicked. Now will I arise, saith the Lord God Al∣mighty,
<PB N="265" REF="037441_0342_100D902147685CC0"/>to trample and thunder down deceit, which hath long reigned and stained the earth. Now will I have my glory out of every one. The Lord God Almighty over all in his strength and power keep you to his glory, that you may come to answer that of God in every one. Pro∣claim the mighty day of the Lord of fire and sword, who will be worshipped in spirit and in truth; and keep in the life and power of the Lord God, that the inhabitants of the earth may tremble before you: that God's power and majesty may be admired among hypocrites and hea∣thens, and ye in the wisdom, dread, life, terror, and domi∣nion preserved to his glory; that nothing may rule or reign but power and life itself, and in the wisdom of God ye may be preserved in it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all. The call is now out of transgression, the Spirit bids, Come. The call is now from all false wor∣ships and Gods, from all inventions and dead works, to serve the living God. The call is to repentance, to amendment of life, whereby righteousness may be brought forth, which shall go throughout the earth. Therefore ye that be chosen and faithful, who are with the Lamb, go through your work faithfully in the strength and power of the Lord, and be obedient to the power; for that will save you out of the hands of unreasonable men, and pre∣serve you over the world to himself. Hereby you may live in the kingdom that stands in power, which hath no where glory and life is.</P>

<P>After the assizes, the sheriff. with some soldiers, came to guard a woman to execution that was sentenced to die; and we had a great deal of discourse with them. One of them wickedly said, <Q>Christ was as passionate a man as any that lived upon the earth.</Q> For which wicked saying we re∣buked him. Another time we asked the gaoler, what do∣ings there were at the sessions? He said, small matters, only about thirty for bastardy. We thought it very strange that they, who professed themselves Christians, should make small matters of such things. But this gaoler was very bad himself. I often admonishee him to sobricty; but he would abuse people that came to visit us. Edward Pyot had a cheese sent him by his wife from Bristol; and the gaoler took the cheese from him, and carried it to the mayor, to fearch it for treasonable letters, as, he said: and though they
<PB N="266" REF="037441_0343_100D9022DB1C0488"/>found no treason in the cheese, they kept it from us. This gaoler might have been rich, if he had carried himself civil∣ly; but he fought his own ruin. which soon after came upon him: for the next year he was turned out of his place, and for some wickedness was cast into the gaol himself; and there begged of our friends. And for some unruliness in his carriage, he was by the succeeding gaoler put into Doomsdale, locked in irons, beaten, and bid to <Q>remember how he had abused those good men, whom he had wick∣edly, without any cause, cast into that nasty prison:</Q> and told, <Q>That now he deservedly should suffer for his wicked∣ness, and the same meature he had meted to others, he should have meted out to himself.</Q> He became very poor, and died in prison. His wife and family came to misery.</P>
<P>While I was in prison at Lanceston, a friend went to Oliver Cromwel, and offered himself, body for body, to lie in Doomsdale in my stead; if he would take him, and set me at liberty. Which thing so struck him, that he said, to his great men and council; <Q>Which of you would do so much for me, if I were in the same condition?</Q> And though he did not accept of the friend's offer, but said, 'He could not do it, for it was contrary to law;' yet the truth thereby came mightily over him. A good while after this he sent down major general Desborow pretending to set us at liberty. When he came, he offered, if we would say, 'We would go home and preach no more,' we should have our liberty; but we could not promise him. Then he urged, that we should promise <Q>to go home if the Lord permitted:</Q> whereupon Edward Pyot wrote him this following letter:</P>

<P>THOUGH much might be said as to the liberty of Englishmen to travel in any part of England, it be∣ing as the Englishman's house by the law, and he to be protected in any part of it; and if he transgress the law, the penalty upon the transgressor is to be inslicted. And as to the liberty of conscience, which is a natural right, and a fundamental, and the exercise of it by those who profess saith in God by Jesus Christ, it is to be protected, as by the instrument of government it appears, though
<PB N="267" REF="037441_0344_100D9024CED370D0"/>they differ in doctrine, worship, and discipline; provided that liberty extend not to property, or prelacy, nor to li∣centiousness. Where these rights are denied us, our liber∣ties are infringed, which are the price of much blood and treasure in the late wars. Yet in the power of God over all, by which all are to be ruled, are we, and in it dwell, and by it alone are guided to do the will of God; whose will is free, and we, in the freedom of his will, walk by the power, either as it commands or permits, without any condition or enforcement thereunto by men; but as the power moves, either by command or permission. And although we cannot covenant or condition to go forth of these parts, or to do this or that thing, if the Lord permit (for that were to do the will of man by God's permission) yet it is like we may pass forth of these parts in the liberty of the will of God, as we may be severally moved and guided by the pure power, and not of necessity. We who were first committed were passing homeward when we were apprehended; and, as far as I know, we might pass, if the prison doors were commanded to be opened, and we freed of our bonds. Should we stay, if the Lord com∣mands us to go, or should we go if the Lord command us to stay; or having no command to stay, but being permitted to pass from hence, the pure power moving thereto, and we yet stay; or go, when as before com∣manded to stay; we should then be wanderers indeed; for such are wanderers, who wander out from the will and power of God, abroad, at large, in their own wills and earthly minds. And so, in the fear of the Lord God, well weigh and consider, with the just weight and just balance, that justice thou mayst do to the just and inno∣cent in prison.</P>

<P>WE who are in the power of God, the ruler of all, the upholder of all things, and know and dwell in his power, to it we must be obedient; which brings us to
<PB N="268" REF="037441_0345_100D90271A9ACE68"/>stand out of all men's wills, unlimited. To say, <Q>We will if the Lord permit,</Q> in a case of buying and selling to get gain, if the intent be so to do, may be done; but we standing in the power of God to do his will, and to stand out of man's will, if man propose, <Q>We shall have our liberty if we will say, we will go to our outward be∣ing, if the Lord permit, or if it be the will of God;</Q> and because we cannot say these words in this case, shall not have our liberty, when we know that the will of God is, we shall "go to speak at some other place:" here we can∣not say these words truly. For to say, <Q>We will go to our outward habitation, if it be according to the will of God,</Q> when we know the will of God is otherwise; we cannot speak so, truly and clearly. Neither can any man say so to him, that requires it of him; who stands in the pow∣er, and knows the power of God to lead him, according to ;God's will, and it leads him to another prace than his out∣ward home. But the Son of God, who came to do and did the will of God, had no place whereon to lay his head: and the apostles, and many of the followers of Christ, had no certain dwelling-place. Now if these should have been restrained, because they could not say they would go to their outward homes, if it were the will of God, when they knew it was the will of God they should not, and they could not do the will of God in doing so, and there∣fore could not speak those words to satisfy man's mind and will, would not such restraint have been evil? Abraham could not do the will of God, but in going from his native country; and who are of faith are of Abraham, of whom Christ came according to the flesh. Now, if you allege, "This is to let all loose and at liberty to idleness," I say, No: such as are in the power of God, who do the will of God, come to receive his wisdom, by which all his crea∣tures were created, and by which they are used to his glo∣ry. This I shall say, whoever are moved by the Lord God of glory and power to go to their outward habitati∣ons, such of us may go to our outward homes; and there be diligent in serving the Lord, that they may be a bles∣sing from God in their generation; diligently serving him in life and doctrine, in manners, in conversation, in all things. And who are moved of the Lord to go to any other place, we standing in his will, and being moved by his power, which comprehends all things, and is not to be limited, we shall do his will which we are commanded to
<PB N="269" REF="037441_0346_100D902907F0C2B8"/>do. So the Lord God open your understandings, that you may see this great power of the Lord, which he is now manifesting among his children in this his day; that ye may not withstand it in our friends, that are come into the power of God, and to God, and know him by whom the world was made, by whom all things were created that were created, and there was not any thing made but what was made for him, and to him, and by him; who is the power of God, and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. Friends being come to this light which cometh from Christ, and having received power from him by whom all things were created, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, who is the wisdom of God; we have received wisdom and power from him, by which the Lord doth give us to know how to use and order the crea∣tures to the glory of him, the Creator of all things. Friends here are taught of the Lord to be diligent, serving him; and who come into the life, the scriptures were given forth from, are given up to serve the Lord. Of this I have in all your consciences a witness. So, if thou open the pri∣son-door, we shall not stay there. If thou send a liberate, and set us free, we shall not stay in prison; so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Israel is to go out free, whose freedom is purchased by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he power of God and the blood of Jesus.

<P>After this major Desborow came to the Castle-green, and played at bowls with the justices and others. Several friends were moved to go and admonish them against 'spending time so vainly;' desiring them to consider, <Q>That though they professed themselves to be christians, yet they gave themselves up to their pleasures, and kept the servants of God mean-while in prison;</Q> and also told them, <Q>The Lord would plead with them, and visit them for such things.</Q> But notwithstanding what was wrote or said to him, he went away, and left us in prison. We understood afterwards that he left the business to colonel Bennet, who had the command of the gaol. For some time after Bennet would have set us at liberty, if we would have paid his gaol∣er's
<PB N="270" REF="037441_0347_100D902B40AC0AF8"/>fees. But we answered, <Q>We could give the gaoler no fees, for we were innocent sufferers; how could they ex∣pect ;fees of us, who had suffered so long wrongfully?</Q> After awhile colonel Bennet coming to town sent for us to an inn, and insisted again upon fees, which we refused. At last the power of the Lord came so over him, that the thir∣teenth of the seventh month, 1656, we were set at liberty. We had been prisoners nine weeks at the first assize, called the Lent-assize, in the spring of the year.</P>
<P>Observing while I was here prisoner how much the peo∣ple (they especially who were called gentry) were addicted to pleasures and vain recreations, I was moved, before I left the place, to give forth several papers as a warning to them, and to all that so mispend their time. One of which was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>This to go abroad among those, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o are given to plea∣sures and wantonness.</HEAD>
<P>THE sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were pride, ful∣ness of bread, and abundance of idleness. Their fil∣thy conversation vexed the righteous soul of just Lot day by d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and they would not take warning; on whom God therefore sent fire, and turned them into ashes. And in spiritual Sodom and Egypt was our Lord Jesus Christ crucified; and it is written, <Q>The people sate down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play; with whom God was not well pleased, and there fell three and twenty thousand in one day.</Q> These the apostle commanded the saints they should not follow; for these things happened to them for examples, and are written for our admonition. God spared not the old world; but reserving Noah, a preacher of righteousness, brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly, making them an example to all that after should live ungodly. Mark, ye ungodly ones, who are as natural brute beasts, who speak great swelling words of vanity, alluring through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day-time, sporting yourselves with your own deceiv∣mgs; ye shall receive the reward of unrighteousness. Ye are as dogs and swine turned to the vomit, and wallowing in the mire, speaking evil of things that ye know not; and unless ye repent, ye shall utterly perish in your own cor∣ruptions. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and
<PB N="271" REF="037441_0348_100D902D54B05748"/>been wanton. Ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just, and he doth not resist you. Go to, weep and howl for the mi∣sery that is coming upon you. She that liveth in plea∣sures, is dead while she liveth. God condemned the ci∣ties of Sodom and Gomorrah, making them an example to all those that after should live ungodly, in the wicked, fil∣thy conversation: mark, here is your example. Hear this, ye that are given to pleasures, and read your exam∣ples.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord to all you vain and idle mind∣ed people, who are lovers of sports, pleasures, foolish exercises, and recreations, as you call them; consider of your ways, what it is you are doing. Was this the end of your creation? Did God make all things for you, and you to serve your lusts and pleasures? Did not the Lord make all things for you, and you for himself, to fear and wor∣ship him in spirit and in truth, in righteousness and true holiness? But where is your service of God, so long as your hearts run after lusts and pleasures? ye cannot serve God and the foolish pleasures of the world, as bowling, drinking, hunting, hawking, and the like. If these have your hearts, God will not have your lips. Consider, for it is true. Therefore from the Lord must you all witness wo and misery, tribulation and wrath, who continue in the love and practice of your vain sports, lusts, and plea∣sures. Now is the day, when all every-where are exhort∣ed to repentance. O foolish people, wicked and flow of heart to believe the threatenings of the great Jehovah against the wicked! What will you do in the day of the Lord's fierce wrath, that makes haste to come upon the world of ungodly men! What good have your foolish sports and delights done you, now they are past? Or what good will they do you, when the Lord calls for your souls? Therefore all now awake from sleep, and see where you are; and let the light of Jesus Christ, that shines in every one of your consciences, search you thoroughly, and it will let you clearly see, for all your profession of God, Christ, and the scriptures, you are ignorant of them, and enemies to them all, and your own souls also; and being
<PB N="272" REF="037441_0349_100D902F4C0ABBB0"/>found living in pleasures, you are dead while you live. Therefore doth the Lord by many messengers forewarn you; and calls you to repentance and deep humiliation; that you may forsake the evil of your doings, own this day of your visitation, and while you have time prize it; lest the things which belong to your peace be hid from your eyes for your disobedience and rebellion against the Holy One. And then it had been good that you never had been born: repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. A∣gain I say, Repent!</P>

<P>Being released, we got horses, rid towards Humphry Lower's, and met him upon the road. He told us, <Q>He was much troubled in his mind concerning us, and could not rest at home; but was going to colonel Bennet to seek our liberty.</Q> When we told him, <Q>We were set at liber∣ty, and were going to his house;</Q> he was exceeding glad. To his house we went, and had a fine, precious meeting; many were convinced, and turned by the Spirit of the Lord to the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching.</P>
<P>From his house we went to Loveday Hambley's; where we had a fine large meeting. The Lord's power was over all; many were convinced there also, and turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, their teacher.</P>
<P>After we had tarried there two or three days, we came to Thomas Mounce's, where we had a general meeting for the whole county; which, being very large, was held in his orchard. Friends from Plymouth were there, and from many places. The Lord's power was over all, and a great convincement there was in many parts of the county. Their watches were down, and all was plain and open; for the Lord had let me see, before I was at liberty, that he would make all the country plain before us. Thomas and Ann Curtis, with an alderman of Reading who was con∣vinced, had come to Lanceston to see us while I was pri∣soner; and when Ann and the other man returned, Thomas Curtis staid behind in Cornwall, and had good service for the Lord at that time.</P>
<P>From Thomas Mounce's we passed to Lanceston again, and visited the little remnant of friends that had been raised up there while we were in prison; and the Lord's plants
<PB N="273" REF="037441_0350_100D9031416D47B8"/>grew finely, and were established on Christ, their rock and foundation. As we were going out of town again, the constable of Lanceston came running to us with the cheese that had been taken from Edward Pyot; which they had kept from us all this while, and were troubled with it. But we, being now at liberty, would not receive it.</P>
<P>From Lanceston we came to Okington; and lay at an inn, which the mayor of the town kept. He had stopped and taken up several friends, but was very civil to us; and was convinced in his judgment.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Exeter, where many friends were in prison; and amongst the rest James Nayler. For a little before we were set at liberty, James had run out into imaginations, and a company with him, who raised up a great darkness in the nation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James Nayler was a monument of human frailty. His gift in the ministry was eminent; his experience in divine things truly great. He sell through unwatchfulness, but was restored through deep sufferings and anfeigned repentance. His own writings are the most clear and lively de∣scription of the various dispensations he underwent: some of them deserve to be transmitted to the latest posterity.</NOTE> He came to Bristol, and made a disturbance there. From thence he was coming to Lanceston, to see me; but was stopped by the way, and imprisoned at Exeter; as were several others, one of whom, an honest, tender man, died in prison there; whose blood lieth on the heads of his persecutors.</P>
<P>The night that we came to Exeter, I spoke with James Nayler: for I saw he was out, and wrong, and so was his company. The next day, being first-day, we went to visit the prisoners, and had a meeting with them in the prison; but James Nayler, and some of them could not stay the meeting. There came a corporal of horse into the meeting, who was convinced, and remained a very good friend. The next day I spoke to James Nayler again; and he slighted what I said, was dark, and much out; yet he would have come and kissed me. But I said, <Q>Since he had turned against the power of God, I could not receive his shew of kindness. The Lord moved me to slight him, and to set the power of God over him.</Q> So after I had been war∣ring with the world, there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst friends to war against. I admonished him and his company. When he was come to London, his resisting the power of God in me, and the truth that was declared to him by me, became one of his greatest burdens. But
<PB N="274" REF="037441_0351_100D90333791EBF0"/>he came to see his out-going, and to condemn it; and after some time he returned to truth again: as in the printed re∣lation of his repentance, condemnation, and recovery may be more fully seen.</P>
<P>We passed from Exeter through Cullumpton and Taun∣ton, visiting friends; and had meetings amongst them. From thence we came to Puddimoor, to William Beaton's; where on a first-day we had a very large meeting. A great convincement there was up and down that country; many meetings we had, and the Lord's power was over all; many were turned, by the power and Spirit of God, to the Lord Jesus Christ, who died for them, and came to sit under his free teaching.</P>
<P>From thence we went to John Dando's, where we had another precious meeting. The Lord's power was over all, and many were convinced of God's eternal truth. Some contention was raised by professors and Baptists, in some places; but the Lord's power came over them. From thence we came to Edward Pyot's, near Bristol. It was, the seventh-day at night that we came thither. It was quickly noised over the town that I was come. I had never been there before.</P>
<P>On first-day morning I went to the meeting in Broadmead at Bristol; which was large and quiet. Notice was given of a meeting to be in the afternoon in the orchard. There was at Bristol a rude Baptist, named Paul Gwin, who had used before to make great disturbance in our meetings; be∣ing encouraged by the mayor, who, as was reported, would sometimes give him his dinner to encourage him. Such multitudes of rude people would he gather after him, that it was thought there had been sometimes ten thousand peo∣ple at our meeting in the orchard. As I was going into the orchard, the people told me, That Paul Gwin, the rude, jangling Baptist, was going to the meeting. I bid them, "Never heed; it was nothing to me, who went to it." When I was come into the orchard, I stood upon the stone that friends used to stand on when they spoke: and was moved of the Lord to put off my hat, and to stand a pretty while; and let the people look at me; for some thousands of people were there. While I thus stood silent, this rude Baptist began to find fault with my hair; but I said nothing to him. Then he ran on into words; and at last, <Q>Ye wise mon of Bristol,</Q> said he, <Q>I strange at you that you will stand here, and hear a man speak and affirm that which
<PB N="275" REF="037441_0352_100D9035B4E467C0"/>he cannot make good.</Q> Then the Lord opened my mouth (for as yet I had not spoken a word) and I asked the peo∣ple, <Q>Whether they ever heard me speak: or ever saw me before?</Q> And bid them <Q>take notice what kind of man this was that should so impudently say amongst them, that I spoke and affirmed that which I could not make good; and yet neither he nor they ever heard me or saw me before. Therefore that was a lying, envious, malicious spirit that spoke in him; and it was of the devil, and not of God. I charged him in the dread and power of the Lord to be silent; and the mighty power of God came over him, and all his company. A glorious, peaceable meeting we had; the word of life was divided amongst them; and they were turned from darkness to light, and to Jesus their Saviour. The scriptures were largely opened to them; and the traditions, rudiments, ways, and doctrines of men were laid open before the people, and they were turned to the light of Christ, that with it they might see them, and see him to lead them out of them. I opened also to them the types, figures, and shadows of Christ in the time of the law; and shewed them, That Christ was come, and had ended the types, shadows, tythes, and oaths, and put down swearing, and had set yea and nay instead of it, and a free ministry: for he was now come to teach people himself, and his heavenly day was springing from on high.</Q> For many hours did I declare the word of life amongst them in the eternal power of God; that by him they might come up into the beginning and be reconciled to him. And having turned them to the Spirit of God in themselves, that would lead into all truth, I was moved to pray in the mighty power of God; and the Lord's power came over all. When I had done, this fellow began to babble again; and John Audland was moved to bid him repent, and fear God. So his own people and followers being ashamed of him, he passed away, and never came again to disturb the meeting. The meeting broke up qui∣etly. and the Lord's power and glory shined over all: a blessed day it was, and the Lord had the praise. After awhile this Paul Gwin went beyond sea; and many years after, I met with him again at Barbadoes: of which in its place.</P>
<P>From Bristol we returned to Edward Pyot's, where we had a great meeting. The Lord's power was over all, truth was declared and spread abroad, and many were turn∣ed
<PB N="276" REF="037441_0353_100D903818AA8788"/>to Christ Jesus, their life, their Prophet to teach them, their Shepherd to feed them, and their Bishop to oversee them. After the meeting I had reasoning with some pro∣fessors; and the Lord's truth and power came over them.</P>
<P>From Edward Pyot's we passed to Slattenford, where we had a very large meeting (Edward Pyot and another friend being still with me;) and a great turning of people there was to the Lord Jesus Christ their teacher. People were glad that they were brought to know their way, their free teacher, and their Saviour Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>The first-day following we went to Nathaniel Crips's house, who had been a justice of peace in Wiltshire; where it was supposed between two and three thousand people were at a meeting, and all was quiet. <Q>The mighty power of God was manifest, and people were turned to the grace and truth in their hearts, that came by Jesus Christ, which would teach them to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly and godly in this present world. So that every man and woman might know the grace of God, which had appeared to all men, which was saving, and sufficient to bring their salvation. This teacher, the grace of God, would teach them how to live, what to do, and what to deny: it would season their words, and esta∣blish their hearts. This was a free teacher to every one of them: so that they might come to be heirs of this grace, and of Christ, by whom it came; who hath ended the prophets, and the priests that took tythes, and the Jewish temple. And as for these hireling priests that take tythes now, and their temples (which priests were made at schools and colleges of man's setting up, and not by Christ) they, with all their inventions, were to be de∣nied. For the apostles denied the true priesthood and which God had commanded, after Christ had put an end thereto. The scriptures, and the truths therein contained, were largely opened, and the people turned to the Spirit of God in their hearts; that by it they might be led into all truth, understand the scriptures, know God and Christ, and come to have unity with them, and one with another in the same Spirit.</Q> The people went away generally satisfied, and were glad that they were turned to Christ Jesus, their Teacher and Saviour.</P>
<P>The next day we went to Marlborough, where we had a little meating. The sessions being held that day, they were granting a warrant to send for me; but justice Stooks,
<PB N="277" REF="037441_0354_100D9039A9F1C718"/>being at the sessions, stopped them, telling them there was a meeting at his house yesterday, at which were several thousands. So the warrant was stopped, our meeting was quiet; and several received Christ Jesus their teacher, and came into the new covenant, and abode in it.</P>
<P>From hence we went to Newbury, where we had a large blessed meeting; several were convinced. Thence we pass∣ed to Reading, where we had a large, precious meeting in the Lord's power amongst the plants of God. Many of other professions came in, were reached, and added to the meeting. All was quiet, and the Lord's power was over all. We went from Reading to Kingston upon Thames, where a few came to us that were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ: but since it is become a large meeting.</P>
<P>Leaving Kingston, we rode to London. When we came near Hyde Park, we saw a great concourse of people, and looking towards them, espied the protector coming in his coach. Whereupon I rode to his coach side. Some of his life-guard would have put me away; but he forbad them. So I rode by his coach side with him, <Q>declaring what the Lord gave me to say to him, of his condition, and of the sufferings of friends in the nation; shewing him, how contrary this persecution was to Christ and his apostles, and to christianity.</Q> When we were come to James's Park Gate, I left him; and at parting he desired me to come to his house. The next day, one of his wife's maids, whose name was Mary Sanders, came to me at my lodging, and told me, Her master came to her, and said, he would tell her some good news. When she asked him, What it was? He told her, George Fox was come to town. She replied, That was good news indeed (for she had re∣ceived truth) but she said, She could hardly believe him; till he told her how I met him, and rode from Hyde Park to James's Park with him.</P>
<P>After a little time Edward Pyot and I went to White∣hall; and when we came before him, Dr. Owen, vice∣chancellor of Oxford, was with him. We were moved to <Q>speak to Oliver Cromwel concerning the sufferings of friends, and laid them before him: and directed him to the light of Christ, who had enlightened every toan that cometh into the world. He said; It was a ratural light; but we shewed him the contrary; and manifested that it was divine and spiritual, proceeding from Christ the spi∣ritual and heavenly man; and that which was called the
<PB N="278" REF="037441_0355_100D903BA0B76D60"/>life in Christ the Word, was called the light in us. The power of the Lord God arose in me, and I was moved in it to bid him lay down his crown at the feet of Jesus.</Q> Several times I spoke to him to the same effect. I was standing by the table, and he came and sat upon the table's side by me, saying, He would be as high as I was: and so continued speaking against the light of Christ Jesus; and went his way in a light manner. But the Lord's power came over him, so that when he came to his wife and other company, he said, 'I never parted so from them before:' for he was judged in himself.</P>
<P>After he had left us, as we were going out, many great persons came about us; one of them began to speak against the light, and against the truth; and I was made to slight him, for speaking so lightly of the things of God. Where∣upon one of them told me he was the major-general of Northamptonshire. 'What!' said I, <Q>our old persecutor, that has persecuted and sent so many of our friends to pri∣son, and is a shame to christianity and religion! I am glad I have met with thee,</Q> said I. So I was moved to speak sharply to him of his unchristian carriages; and he slunk away: for he had been a cruel persecutor in North∣amptonshire.</P>
<P>After I had visited the meetings of friends in and about London, I went into Buckinghamshire, and Edward Pyot was with me; and in several places in that county many received the truth. Great meetings we had, and the Lord's power was eminently manifested. I passed through North∣amptonshire and Nottinghamshire into Lincolnshire. After several meetings in Lincolnshire, I had at last a meeting, where two knights, one called Sir Richard Wrey, the other Sir John Wrey, with their wives, were at the meeting. One of then wives was convinced, received the truth, and died in it. When the meeting was done, we passed away; and it being in the evening, and dark, a company of wild serving men encompassed ine about, with intent, as I ap∣prehended, to have done me some mischief. But I spoke aloud to them, and asked, 'What are ye? highwaymen? Whereupon some friends and friendly people behind came up to us, and knew some of them. So I reproved them for their uncivil and rude carriage, exhorted them to fear God, and the Lord's power came over them, and stopped their misehievous design; blessed be his name for ever.</P>
<P>Then I turned into Huntingdonshire. The mayor of
<PB N="279" REF="037441_0356_100D903DE81DED90"/>Huntingdon came to visit me, and was very loving, and his wife received the truth.</P>
<P>Thence I passed into Cambridgeshire, and into the Fen Country; where I had many meetings, and the Lord's truth spread. Robert Craven (who had been sheriff of Lincoln) Amor Stoddart, and Alexander Parker were with me. We went to Crowland, a very rude place; for the town's people were got together at the inn we went to, and were half drunk, both priest and people. <Q>I reproved them for their drunkenness, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the wicked; exhort∣ing them to leave their drunkenness, and turn to the Lord in time.</Q> Whilst I was thus speaking to them, and shew∣ing the priest the fruits of his ministry, the priest and the clerk broke out into a rage, and got up the tongs and fire∣shovel at us; so that had not the Lord's power preserved us, we might have been murdered amongst them. Yet, for all their rudeness and violence, some received the truth then; and have stood in it ever since.</P>
<P>From thence we passed to Boston, where most of the chief of the town came to our inn, and the people seemed to be much satisfied. But there was a raging man in the yard; and Robert Craven was moved to speak to him, and told him, He shamed christianity; which, with some few other words, so stopped the man, that he went away quiet. Some were convinced there also.</P>
<P>Thus we had large meetings up and down; for I travel∣led into Yorkshire, and returned out of Holderness, over Humber, visiting friends; and then going into Leicester∣shire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire, among friends. I had a meeting at Edge-hill. There came to it Ranters, Baptists, and several sorts of rude people; for I had sent word about three weeks before, to have a meeting there; so that hundreds of people were gathered, and many friends came from far to it. The Lord's ever∣lasting truth and word of life reached over all; rude and unruly spirits were chained down; and many that day were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, by his power and Spirit, who came to sit under his blessed free teaching, and to be fed with his eternal, heavenly food. All was peaceable; the people passed quietly away, and some of them said, It was a mighty, powerful meeting: for the presence of the Lord was felt, and his power and Spirit amongst them.</P>
<P>From hence I passed to Warwick, and to Bagley; hav∣ing
<PB N="280" REF="037441_0357_100D90404E5BEB28"/>precious meetings. From thence into Gloucestershire, and so to Oxford, where the scholars were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, and great meetings we had up and down, as we travelled. Then I went to colo∣nel Grimes's, where was a very large meeting; and from thence to Nathaniel Crips's, where came another justice to the meeting, who was also convinced. At Cirencester also we had a meeting, which is much increased; so we came to Evesham again, where I met John Camm.</P>
<P>Thus having travelled over most part of the nation, I returned to London, having cleared myself of that which lay upon me from the Lord. For after I was released out of Lanceston gaol, I was moved of the Lord to travel over most parts of the nation (the truth being now spread, and finely planted in most places) that I might answer, and re∣move out of the minds of people some objections, which envious priests and professors had raised and spread concern∣ing us. For, what Christ said of false prophets and anti∣christs coming in the last days, that they applied to us; and said, We were they.</P>
<P>Therefore was I moved to open this through the nation, and to shew, 'That they, who said we were the false pro∣phets, antichrists, and deceivers, that should come in the last days, were indeed themselves they. For when Christ told his disciples in the viith and xxivth of Matthew, that false prophets and antichrists should come in the last times, and, if it were possible, should deceive the very elect, he said, <Q>By their fruits ye shall know them: for they should be inwardly ravening wolves, having the sheeps cloathing. And,</Q> said he, <Q>do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</Q> as much as to say, Their nature and spirit should be like a thorn, or like a thistle; and he bids his disciples not go after them. But before the disciples were deceased, the antichrists, false prophets, and deceivers were come. For John in his first epistle said, <Q>Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</Q> So here, as Christ said to his disciples, They should come; the disciples saw they were come: as may be seen at large in Peter. Jude, John, and other places of scripture; "whereby," says John, "we know it is the last time:" and this last time began above sixteen hundred years since. John said <Q>They went out from us;</Q> the false prophets, antichrists, seducers, and
<PB N="281" REF="037441_0358_100D9041E0DE5A38"/>deceivers, went out from the church; "But you," said he to the church, <Q>have an anointing which abideth in you; and you need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things; and as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</Q> Christ said to his disciples, <Q>Go not after them, for they are inwardly ra∣vening wolves;</Q> and John exhorts the saints to the anointing within them; and the rest of the apostles ex∣hort the churches to the grace, the light, the truth, the Spirit, the word of faith, and to Christ in their hearts, the hope of glory. Christ told the saints, that the Spirit of truth, the Holy Ghost, should be their leader into all truth; and Jude exhorts the church to <Q>pray in the Ho∣ly Ghost,</Q> and <Q>to be built up in their most holy faith, which Christ was the author of.</Q> Christ, by his servant <Q>John, exhorted the seven churches to hear what the Spirit said to the churches;</Q> and this was an inward spiritual hearing. Christ says, the inwardly ravening wolves should have the sheeps cloathing. Paul speaks of some in his time that had a form of godliness, but denied the power. John said, "They went out from us." Jude said, <Q>They go in Cain's way, and in Balaam's and Corah's way.</Q> By all which it may be clearly seen, that the false prophets and antichrists, which Christ foretold should come, the apostles saw were come; and in their day the last time was begun. These went from them into the world, and the world went after them! These were the fore-men, the leaders of the world, that brought them into a form of godliness, but inwardly ravened from the power and Spirit! These have the sheeps cloathing, the words of Christ, of the prophets, and of the apostles; but are in∣wardly ravened from the power and Spirit that they were in who gave forth the scriptures. These have made up the beast, and the whore! These have gotten the dragon's power, the murdering, destroying, persecuting, power! And these are they that the world wonders after! These have drunk the blood of the martyrs, prophets, and saints, and persecuted the true church into the wilderness! These have set up the salse, compelling worships, and have drunk the blood of the saints, that will not drink of their cup! These have made the cage for the unclean birds, that have their several unclean notes in their cage; which cage is made up by the power of darkness, and unclean ghost: and the birds of the cage deny the Holy Chofl, and the
<PB N="282" REF="037441_0359_100D9043747C1C88"/>power of God, which the apostles were in, to be now manifested in the saints! Thus since Christ said, the false prophets and antichrists should come, and the apostle said. They were come, the beast's and the dragon's wor∣ship hath been set up; the whore is got up with her false prophets, her cage hath been made, all nations have drunk of her cup of fornication, the blood of the martyrs and saints they have drunk, and the true church hath fled into the wilderness. All this since the apostles days. Yet the blind deceivers of all sorts, the antichrists and false prophets of our age, would make us and people believe that the false prophets, antichrists, and deceivers are come but now; though John and other of the apostles tell us, they began to come above sixteen hundred years ago. And ye may see what work and confusion they have made in the world; how much blood these Cains have drunk, that went in Cain's way: which blood cries to God for vengeance upon Christendom! And how these Balaams, who have erred from the power of the Spirit which the apostles were in, have coveted after other men's estates, the many gaols, courts, and spoiling of goods will bear witness. And how these Corahs have gainsayed the lise, power, and spirit which the apostles and true church were in, and the free teaching of Christ and of his apostles, and the work of their ministry, which was <Q>to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,</Q> hath been evident.</P>
<P>Therefore in the name and power of the Lord Jesus was I sent to preach again the everlasting gospel, which had been preached before unto Abraham, and in the apostles days; and was to go over all nations, and to be preached to every creature. For as the apostacy hath gone over all nations since the apostles days, so that the nations are be∣come as waters, unstable, being gone from Christ, the foundation; so must the gospel, the power of God, go over all nations again. We find the false prophets, anti∣christs deceivers, whore, false church, beast, and his wor∣ship in the dragon's power, have got up in the times betwixt the apostles and us. For Christ said, <Q>They should come:</Q> and the apostles saw, "They were come," and coming in their days; and that they went forth from them, and the world went after them. And now hath the Lord raised us up beyond them, and set us over them in the everlasting gospel, the power of God: that as all have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned by the beasts, whore, false prophets, and anti∣christs,
<PB N="283" REF="037441_0360_100D90456F1FCFF0"/>so the everlasting gospel may be preached again by us to all nations, and to every creature, which will bring life and immortality to light in them, that they may see over the devil and his false prophets, antichrists, seducers and deceivers, and over the whore and beast, and to that which was before they were. This message of the glorious, everlasting gospel was I sent forth to declare and publish, and thousands by it are turned to God, having received it; and are come into subjection to it, and into the holy order of it. And since I have declared this message in this part of the world and in America, and have written books of the same, to spread it universally abroad, the blind pro∣phets, preachers, and deceivers have given over telling us, the salse prophets should "come in the last times;" for a great light is sprung up and shines over their heads: so that every child in truth sees the folly of their sayings.</P>
<P>Then they got other objections against us, and invented shifts to save themselves from truth's stroke. For when we blamed them for taking tithes, which came from the tribe of Levi, and were set up here by the Romish church, they would plead, <Q>That Christ told the scribes and pharisees, they ought to pay tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, though they neglected the weightier matters:</Q> and that Christ said, <Q>the scribes and pharisees sat in Moses's seat, therefore all that they bid you do, that do and observe.</Q> And when we told them they were envious persecuting priests, they would reply, <Q>That some preached Christ of envy, and some of contention, and some of good-will.</Q> Now these scriptures and others such-like they would bring to darken the minds of their hearers, and to persuade them and us, <Q>That we ought to do as they say, though they themselves were like the pharisees; and that we should re∣joice when envious men and men of strife preached Christ; and that we should give them the tithes as the Jews did to the tribe of Levi.</Q> These were fair glosses; here was a great heap of husks, but no kernel. Now this was their blindness; for the Levitical priesthood Christ hath ended, and disannulled the commandment that gave them tithes, and the law by which those priests were made. Christ did not come after that order, neither did he send forth his mi∣nisters after that order: for those of that order were to take tithes for their maintenance, but his ministers he sent forth freely. And as for hearing the pharisees and the Jews pay∣ing tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, that was before
<PB N="284" REF="037441_0361_100D90475E444A80"/>Christ was sacrificed and offered up; the Jews were then to do the law, and perform their offerings and sacrifices which the Jewish priests did teach them. But after Christ was offered up, he bid them then <Q>Go into all nations and preach the gospel; and lo,</Q> said he, <Q>I will be with you to the end of the world;</Q> and in another place he saith, "I will be in you." He did not bid them go to hear the pharisees then, and pay tithe of mint, anise, and cummin then; but <Q>Go, preach the gospel, and believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, and receive the gospel,</Q> which would bring people off from the Jews, the tithes, the Levitical law, and the offerings thereof, to Christ, the one Offering, made once for all. O what work had the apostle both with the Galatians and the Romans to bring them off the law to the faith in Christ!</P>
<P>And as for the apostle's saving, <Q>Some preached Christ of envy and strife,</Q> &amp;c. That was at the first spreading of Christ's name abroad, when they were in danger not on∣ly to be cast out of the synagogues, but to be stoned to death, that confessed to the name of Jesus; as may be seen by the uproars that were among the Jews and Diana's worshippers at the preaching of Christ. So the apostle might well rejoice if the envious, and men of strife and contention did preach Christ at that time; though they thought thereby to add affliction to his bonds. But af∣terward, when Christ's name was spread abroad, and ma∣ny had got a form of godliness, but denied the power thereof, <Q>Envious, proud, contentious men, men of strife, covetous men, teachers for filthy lucre,</Q> the apostle com∣manded the saints to turn from, and not to have any fel∣lowship with them. And the deacons and ministers were first to be proved, to see if they were in the power of godliness, and the Holy Ghost made them overseers and preachers. So it may be seen how the priests have abus∣ed these scriptures for their own ends, and have wrested them to their own destruction, to justify envious, conten∣tions men, and men of strife. Whereas the apostle says, "The man of God must be patient, and apt to teach;" and they were to follow Christ, as they had them for their examples. The apostle indeed was very tender to people, while he saw them walk in simplicity, as in the case of those that were scrupulous about meats and days; but when the apostle saw, that some drew them into the observation of days, and to settle in such things, he then
<PB N="285" REF="037441_0362_100D9049A1445B80"/>reproves them sharply, and asks them, <Q>Who had be∣witched them?</Q> So in the case of marrying he was ten∣der, lest their minds should be drawn from the Lord's joining; but when they came to forbid marriage, and to set up rules for meats and drinks, he called it a <Q>doctrine of devils,</Q> and an "erring from the true faith." So also he was tender concerning circumcision, and in tenderness suffered some to be circumcised; but when he saw they went to make a sect of it, and to set up circumcision as a standing practice, he told them plainly, <Q>If they were circumcised, Christ would profit them nothing.</Q> In like manner he was tender concerning the baptizing with water; but when he saw they began to make sects about it, some crying up Paul, others Apollos, he judged them, and called them carnal, and thanks God he had baptized no more but such and such; declaring plainly, that he was sent to preach the gospel, and not to baptize; and brought them to the one baptism by the one spirit, into the one body which Christ, the spiritual man, is the head of; and exhorted the church, <Q>all to drink into that one Spirit.</Q> For he asserted in the church the one saith, which Christ was the author of; and one baptism, which was that of the Spirit into the one body; and one Lord Jesus Christ, who was the spiritual baptizer, who John said should come after him. And further the aposile de∣clared, that they, who worshipped and served God in the Spirit, were of the circumcision of the Spirit, which was "not made with hands;" by which the <Q>body of the sins of the flesh was put off:</Q> which circumcision Christ is the minister of.</P>
<P>Another great objection they had, <Q>That the Quakers denied the sacrament,</Q> as they called it, <Q>of bread and wine, which</Q> they said, <Q>they were to take, and do in re∣membrance of Christ to the end of the world.</Q> A great deal of work we had with the priests and professors about this, and about the several modes of receiving it in Christ-endom, so called: for some of them take it lanceling, some sitting; but none of them all, that ever I could sind, take it as the disciples took it. For they took it in a chamber after supper; but these generally take it before dinner and some say, after the priest hath blessed it, it is <Q>Christ body.</Q> But as to the matter, Christ said, <Q>Do this in remembrance of me.</Q> He did not tell them how oft they should do it, or how long; neither did he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
<PB N="286" REF="037441_0363_100D904B56A35190"/>do it always as long as they lived, or that all believers in him should do it to the world's end. The apostle Paul, who was not converted till after Christ's death, tells the Corinthians, that he had received of the Lord that which he delivered unto them concerning this matter, and relates Christ's words concerning the cup thus; "This do ye," as oft as ye drink it, "in remembrance of me:" and himself adds, <Q>For [as often as] ye do eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</Q> So according to what the apostle here delivers, neither Christ nor he did enjoin people to do this always, but leaves it to their liberty, ["as oft as ye drink it," &amp;c.] The Jews did use to take a cup, and to break bread and divide it among them in their seasts; as may be seen in the Jewish Antiquities; so the breaking of bread and drinking of wine were Jewish rites, which were not to last always. They did also baptize with water, which made it not seem a strange thing to them, when John the Baptist came with his decreasing ministration of water-baptism. But as to the bread and wine, after the disciples had taken it, some of them questioned whether Jesus was the Christ? For some of them said, after he was crucified, <Q>We trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel,</Q> &amp;c. And though the Corinthians had the bread and wine, and were baptized in water, the apostle told them they were "reprobates, if Christ was not in them;" and bid them "examine themselves." And as the apostle said, <Q>As oft as ye do cat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do s;hew forth the Lord's death [till he come;]</Q> so Christ had said before that he was the "bread of life," which "came down from heaven;" and that <Q>he would come, and dwell in them;</Q> which the apostles did witness ful∣filled; and exhorted others to seek for that which <Q>comes down from above:</Q> but the outward bread and wine, and water, are not from above but from below. Now ye that eat and drink this outward bread and wine in remem∣brance of Christ's death, and have your fellowships in that, will ye come no nearer to Christ's death than to take bread and wine in remembrance of it? After ye have eaten in remembrance of his death, ye must come into his death, and die with him, as the apostles did, if ye will live with him. This is a nearer and further advanced state, to be with him in the fellowship of his death, than only to take bread and wine in remembrance of it. You must have
<PB N="287" REF="037441_0364_100D904D8A7E5EF0"/>fellowship with Christ in his sufferings; if ye will reign with him, ye must suffer with him; if ye will live with him, ye must die with him; and if ye die with him, ye must be buried with him; and being buried with him in the true baptism, ye also rise with him. Then having suf∣fered with him, died with him, and been buried with him, if ye are risen with Christ, <Q>seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</Q> Eat the bread which comes down from above, which is not outward bread; and drink the cup of salvation which he gives in his kingdom, which is not outward wine. And then there will not be a looking at the things that are seen (as outward bread and wine and water are:) for, as says the apostle, <Q>The things that are seen are tempo∣ral, but the things that are not seen are eternal.</Q> So here are many states and conditions to be gone through before people come to see that, and partake of that which "cometh down from above." For first, There was <Q>a taking of the outward bread and wine in remembrance of Christ's death.</Q> This was temporary, and not of neces∣sity; but at their liberty, "As oft as ye do it," &amp;c. Se∣condly, There must be <Q>a coming into his death, a suf∣fering with Christ;</Q> and this is of necessity to salvation; and not temporary, but continual: there must be <Q>a dying daily.</Q> Thirdly, "a being buried with Christ." Fourthly, "a rising with Christ." Fifthly, After they are risen with Christ, then <Q>a seeking those things which are above, a seeking the bread that comes down from heaven,</Q> and a <Q>feeding on that and having fellowship in that.</Q> For outward bread, wine, and water are from below, and are visible and temporal; but, saith the apos∣tle, <Q>We look not at things that are seen, for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.</Q> So the fellowship that stands in the use of bread, wine, water, circumcision, outward temple, and things seen will have an end: but the fellowship which stands in the gospel, the power of God, which was before the devil was, and which brings life and immortality to light, by which people may see over the devil that has darkened them, this fellowship is eternal, and will stand. And all that are in it seek that which is heavenly and eternal, which comes down from above, and are settled in the eternal mystery of the fellowship of the gospel, which is hid from all eyes that look only at visible things. The apostle told

<P>Thus were the objections which the priests and professors had raised against friends answered, and the stumbling-blocks they had laid in the way of the weak removed. And as things were thus opened, people came to see over them and through them, and to have their minds settled upon the Lord Jesus Christ, their free teacher: which was the service for which I was moved to travel over the nation after my imprisonment in Lanceston gaol. In this year the Lord's truth was finely planted over the nation, and many thousands were turned to the Lord; insomuch that there were seldom sewer than one thousand in prison in this na∣tion for truth;s testimony; some for tithes, some for going to the steeple-houses, some for contempts, as they called them, some for not swearing, and others for not putting off their hats, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I had visited most parts of the nation, and was come to London again, finding that evil spirit at work which had drawn J. N. and his followers out of the truth, to run friends into heats about him, I wrote a short epistle to friends, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TO all the elect seed of God called Quakers, where the death is brought into death, and the elder is servant to the younger, and the elect is known, which cannot be deceived, but obtains victory. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, Go not forth to the aggravating part, to strive with it out of the power of God, lest ye hurt yourselves, and run into the same na∣ture, out of the life. For patience must get the victory, and to answer that of God in every one, which must bring every one to it to bring them from the contrary. Let your moderation, temperance, and patience be known unto all men in the seed of God. For that which reacheth to the aggravating part without life, sets up the aggravating part and breeds confusion; and hath a life in outward strife, but reacheth not to the witness of God in every one, through which they might come into peace and covenant with God, and fellowship one with another. Therefore that which reacheth this witness of God in yourselves, and in others, is the life and light; which will out-last all is
<PB N="289" REF="037441_0366_100D9051C8BC5018"/>over all, and will overcome all. Therefore in the seed of life live, which bruiseth the seed of death.</P>

<P>I wrote another short epistle to friends, to encourage them to keep up their meetings in the Lord's power; which here followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>KEEP your meetings in the power of the Lord; which power is over all that which is in the fall and must have an end. Therefore be wise in the wisdom of God, which is from above, by which all things were made and created; that that may be justified among you, and you all kept in the solid life, which was before death was; and in the light which was before darkness was with all its works. In which light and life ye all may feel and have heavenly unity and peace, possessing the gospel-fellowship that is everlasting; which was before that which doth not last for ever, and will remain when that is gone. For the gospel being the power of God, is pure and everlasting. Know it to be your portion; in which is stability, life, and immortality, shining over that which darkens the mortal. So be faithful every one to God in your mea∣sures of his power and life, that ye may answer God's love and mercy to you, as obedient children of the Most High; dwelling in love, unity, peace, and innocency of heart towards one another; that God may be glorified in you, and you kept faithful witnesses for him, and valiant for the truth on earth. God Almighty preserve you all to his glory, that ye may feel his blessing among you, and that ye may be possessors thereof.</P>

<P>About this time many mouths being opened in our meetings to declare the goodness of the Lord, some that were young and tender in the truth would sometimes utter a few words in thanksgiving and praises to God; that no disorder might arise from thence in our meetings, I was moved to write an epistle to friends by way of advice in that matter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL my dear friends in the noble seed of God, who have known his power, life, and presence among
<PB N="290" REF="037441_0367_100D9053B9BB7EC8"/>you, let it be your joy to hear or see the springs of life break forth in any; through which ye have all unity in the same, feeling life and power. And above all things take heed of judging any one openly in your meetings, except they be openly prophane or rebellious, such as are out of the truth; that by the power, life, and wisdom ye may stand over them, and by it answer the witness of God in the world, that such, whom ye bear your testimony against, are none of you: that therein the truth may stand clear and single. But such as are tender, if they should be moved to bubble forth a few words, and speak in the seed and Lamb's power, suffer and bear that; that is, the ten∣der. And if they should go beyond their measure, bear it in the meeting for peace and order's sake, and that the spi∣rits of the world be not moved against you. But when the meeting is done, if any be moved to speak to them, be∣tween you and them, one or two of you that feel it in the life, do it in the love and wisdom that is pure and gentle from above, for love is that which edifies, bears all things, suffers long, and fulfils the law. In this ye have order and edification, ye have wisdom to preserve you all wise and in patience; which takes away the occasion of stumb∣ling the weak, and the occasion of the spirits of the world to get up: but in the royal feed, the heavy stone, ye keep down all that is wrong, and by it answer that of God in all. For ye will hear, see, and feel the power of God preach∣ing, as your faith is wholly in it (when ye do not hear words) to bind, to chain, to limit, to frustrate, that no∣thing shall rise nor come forth but what is in the power; with that ye will hold back, with that ye will let up and open every spring, plant, and spark; in which will be your joy and refreshment in the power of God. Ye that know the power of God and are come to it, which is the cross of Christ, that crucifies you to the state that Adam and Eve were in in the fall, and so to the world, by this power of God ye come to see the state that Adam and Eve were in before they fell: which power of God is the cross, in which stands the everlasting glory, which brings up into righteousness and holiness, the image of God, and cruci∣fies to unrighteousness and unholiness, the image of satan, that Adam and Eve and their sons and daughters are in under the fall. Through this power of God ye come to see the state they were in before they fell; yea, and I say, to an higher state, to the Seed Christ, the Second Adam,
<PB N="291" REF="037441_0368_100D90558FF2CB50"/>by whom all things were made. For man hath been driv∣en from God. All Adam and Eve's sons and daughters, being in the state of the fall in the earth, are driven from God. But it is said. "The church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:" so who come to the church, which is in God the Father of Christ, they must come to God again, out of the state that Adam and his children are in in the sall, out of the image of God, out of righteous∣ness and holiness; and they must come into the righteous∣ness, into the true holiness, the image of God, and out of the earth whither man hath been driven, when they come to the church which is in God. The way to this is Christ, the Light, the Life, the Truth, the Saviour, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier, and the Justifier, in and through whose power, light, and life, conversion, regeneration, and translation is known from death to life, from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to God again. These are members of the true church, who know the work of re∣generation in the operation and feeling of it; and being come to be members of the church of God, they are indeed members one of another in the power of God, which was before the power of darkness was. So they that come to the church that is in God and Christ, must come out of the state that Adam was in in the fall, driven from God, to know the state that he was in before he fell. But they that live in the state that Adam was in in the fall, and can∣not believe a possibility of coming into the state he was in before he fell, come not to the church which is in God; but are far from that, are not passed from death to life, but are onemies to the cross of Christ, which is the power of God. For they mind earthly things, and serve not Christ; nor love the power which should bring them up to the state that Adam was in before he fell, and crucify them to the state that man is in in the fall; that through this pow∣er they might see to the beginning, the power that man was in before the heavenly image, holiness and righteous∣ness was lost: by which power they might come to know the Seed. Christ, which brings out of the old things, and makes all things new; in which life eternal is felt. For all the poorness, emptiness, and barrenness is in the state that man is in in the fall, out of God's power; by which power he is made rich again, and in winch power he hath strength again: which power is the cross, in which the my∣stery of the fellowship stands; and in which is the true glo∣rying,
<PB N="292" REF="037441_0369_100D90584250F0F8"/>which crucifies to all other glorings. And friends, though ye may have been convinced, and have tasted of the power, and felt the light, yet afterwards ye may feel a winter-storm, tempest and hail, frost and cold, and tempt∣ation in the wilderness. Be patient and still in the power and in the light that doth convince you, to keep your minds to God; in that be quiet, that ye may come to the summer; that your flight be not in the winter. For if ye sit still in the patience which overcomes in the power of God, there will be no flying. The husbandman, after he hath sown his seed, is patient. And ye by the power be∣ing kept in the patience, will come by the light to see through and feel over winter-storms and tempests, and all the coldness, barrenness, and emptiness: and the same light and power will go over the tempter's head; which power and light was before he was. So in the light stand∣ing still, ye will see your salvation, ye will see the Lord's strength, ye will feel the small rain, ye will feel the fresh springs, your minds being kept low in the power and light: for that which is out of the power lifts up. But in the power and light ye will feel God, revealing his secrets, inspiring your minds, and his gifts coming in unto you; through which your hearts will be filled with God's love, and praises to him that lives for evermore; for in his light and power his blessing is received. So in that, the eternal power of the Lord Jesus Christ preserve and keep you! Live every one in the power of God, that ye may all come to be heirs of that, and know that to be your portion; even the kingdom that hath no end, and the endless life which the Seed is heir of. Feel that set over all, which hath the promise, and blessing of God for ever.</P>

<P>About this time I received some lines from a high-flown professor concerning the way of Christ; to which I return∣ed the following answer:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not oncumstances we contend about; but the way of Christ and his light, which are but one; though the world hath imagined many ways, and all out of the light which by the light are condemned. He who preach∣ed this light, said, <Q>He that knoweth God, heareth us;
<PB N="293" REF="037441_0370_100D7F5CC216F150"/>he that is not of God, heareth us not: hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</Q> It is the same now with them that know the truth; though the whole world lies in wickedness. All dispensations and differences that are not one in the light we deny; and by the light, that was before separation, do we see them to be self-separations in the sensual, having not the Spirit. Their fruits and end are weighed in the even balance, and found to be in the dark, the Lo-here. and Lo-there thou tellest of; and the presence of Christ is not with them, though the blind see it not; who see not with the pure eye, which is single; but with the many eyes, which lead into the many ways. Nor are any the people of God, 'but who are baptized into this principle of light: which all the faithful servants of the Lord were ever guided by in all ages, since the apostacy and before. For the apo∣stacy was and is from the light; and all that oppose the light are apostates. Who contest against the truth, are enemies to it, and are not actuated by the Spirit; but have another way than the light. All such are in the world, its words, fashions, and customs, though of seve∣ral forms, as to their worship; yet all under the god of this world, opposing the light and appearance of Christ, which should lead out from under his power, of what form soever they are; yet are they all joined against the light. All these are of the world; and fighting against them who are not of the world; but are gathered and gathering out of the world: so it ever was against the people of God, under what name soever. They only are saints by calling, who are called into the light; and sons of Sion, which vary not from the light, to which the Spirit is promised, which is not tied to any forms out of the light; wherein all inherit, who are co-heirs with Christ; which many talk of who inherit the earthly, instead of the heavenly. And whereas thou speakest of Christ and his apostles cloath∣ing themselves with the sayings and words of the prophets; and of their being your example in so doing; I say, wolves will take the sheeps cloathing; but the light and life finds them out, and judges (not by their stolen words, but) by their works. Nor did Christ cover himself with any words, but what were fulfilled in him: neither do any of Christ's boast in other men's lines made ready without them; to which rule if ye be obedient, fewer words and more life will be seen among you. Then ye will not
<PB N="294" REF="037441_0371_100D905C0F80CFA0"/>count in straitness to silence the flesh; and hear what he saith, who speaks peace, <Q>that his people turn no more to folly.</Q> If ye once know, that what is stolen must be restored fourfold; the mouth of the false prophet will be stopped, which builds up in deceit, but, not in righteous∣ness. And whereas thou sayest, <Q>The Spirit of truth affords nothing but endless varieties;</Q> I say, the Spirit of truth thou knowest not: for the Spirit of truth said, "There is but one thing needful;" and to speak the same thing again is safe for the hearers; but that spirit which affords nothing but endless varieties, is not the Spirit of truth, but is gone out into curious notions; and the num∣ber of his names and colours is read no-where but in the unity of the Spirit of truth. All others call truth deceit, and deceit truth, as the blind that opposed the light ever did, who are ever learning endless varieties, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, nor to an end of their labours: but when they are out of one form get into ano∣ther, so long as they can find a green tree without. Thus ye are kept at work all your life, and to the grave in for∣row, as the dumb priests, thou tellest of, have been before you; only ye have got a finer image, but less life. And thou, whose teaching hath no' end, art in the horse-mill thou speakest of. I have read the epistles to Timothy, and to the Hebrews; and there I find, the duty of all believers is to see the law of the new covenant written in the heart, whereby all may know God, from the least to-the greatest. I know the holy scriptures are profitable for the man of God; but what is that to the man of sin, to the first-born, who is out of the light, and being unstable and unlearned, wrest them to their own destruction; but to the life cannot come? And for your two ordinances thou speakell of, I say, upon the same account ye deny the priests of the world therein, we deny you; being both of you not-only out of the life, but out of the form too. That command, Matt. xxviii. 19. ye never had, nor its pow∣er; which was, <Q>To baptize into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</Q> What Paul received of the Lord, that body and that bread, ye know as little of, but what ye have found in the chapter; nor of the coming of Christ neither, who cannot believe his light. And where∣as thou speakest of preaching Christ of envy, and pleadest for it; I say, such preachers we have enough of in these days. What else art thou doing, who sayest, Paul was
<PB N="295" REF="037441_0372_100D7F5E449AD540"/>sent to baptize; though Paul says, he was not: so thou wouldest prove him a liar, if any would believe thee before him. Thou sayest also, <Q>For aught thou knowest, he might baptize thousands.</Q> Thou mightest as easily have said millions, and as soon have proved it. Thou mayest say the same of circumcision also, and on the same ground. As for the signs that followed those that believed. which thou sayest are ceased; I say, they who cannot re∣ceive the light cannot see the signs, nor could believe them, if they should see them to carp at; no more than sormerly they could do, who opposed the light in former ages. They cannot properly be said to cease to such, who never had them; but have only heard or read that others long ago had them. But that the power, and signs, and pre∣sence of God is not the same that ever it was, in the mea∣sure wherein he is received in the light, that I deny; and declare it to be false, and from a spirit that knows not God, nor his power. And as for the gospel-foundation thou speakest of, I say, it is to be laid again in all the world. Ye never were on it, since the man of sin set up his forms without power. Till ye can own the light of Christ, which the saints preached, and their life and practice; for shame, cease to talk of their foundation, or glorious work, or quakings and tremblings, the faints experiences, which the world knows not, nor can own: though ye cannot read that ever any came aright to declare how they knew God, or received his word, without them. In thy exhortation thou biddest me, "Love Christ, wherefoever I see him." But hadst thou told me where one might come to see him, or how one might know him, thou hadst shewn more of a christian in that than in all thou hast spoken. But it seems, ye are not all of one mind. Some of you say, "He is gone, and will be no more seen till doomsday." But if ever ye come to see Christ to your comfort, while ye oppose his light, then God hath not spoken by me. This thou shalt remember, when thy time thou hast spent.</P>

<P>Great opposition did the priests and professors make about this time against the light of Christ Jesus, denying it to be universally given; and against the pouring forth of the Spirit, and sons and daughters prophesying thereby. Much they laboured to darken the minds of people, that they might keep them still in a dependence on their teach∣ing
<PB N="296" REF="037441_0373_100D905E00DCF280"/>Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to give forth the following lines, for the opening of the minds and un∣derstandings of people, and to manifest the blindness and darkness of their teachers.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TO you professors, priests, and teachers, who are in darkness, and know not the Spirit in prison, nor the light that shines in darkness, which the darkness doth not comprehend; but are as infidels, whom the god of the world hath blinded, and to whom the gospel is hid. For though ye have the four books, the gospel is hid to you; who are now stranging at the work of God, and do not believe that Christ hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world. To you I offer some scriptures to read, which will prove your spirits, and try them, how contrary they are to the apostles spirit, the Spirit of Christ and of the saints. <Q>Christ went, and preached to the spirits in prison,</Q> 1 Pet. iii. 19. He that readeth, let him under∣stand whether this was a measure of the Spirit, yea or nay, or the Spirit without measure, which he ministered to? <Q>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him,</Q> Joh. iii. 34. Here Christ had not the Spirit given unto him by measure. The apostle said, <Q>We will not boast of things without (or beyond) our measure,</Q> 2 Cor. x. 13. So here was measure, and not by measure. Christ, who received not the Spirit by measure, told his disciples he would <Q>send them the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, that he should guide them into all truth: for the should not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you,</Q> Joh. xvi. 13, 14. Mind, read, and learn; the Comforter shall receive of mine, saith Christ, and shall shew it unto you: who hath the measure, re∣ceives of his who hath not by measure. The Comforter, when he comes, is to reprove the world of sin, of righte∣ousness, and of judgment, ver. 8. Now mind the great work of God: the Spirit of truth, which leads the saints into all truth, which receives of Christ's, and shews it unto the disciples, who are in the measure, he shall reprove the world of sin, because they do not believe, &amp;c. The Comforter, whom Christ will send, takes of his, and shews it to the disciples, the same reproves the world. Mind
<PB N="297" REF="037441_0374_100D90604972CED8"/>now, whether this be a measure, yea or nay, which comes from him who received not the Spirit by measure? He that leads the believer into all truth, reproves the unbe∣liever in the world, of sin, of righteousness, and of judg∣ment. He that is led into all truth, sees that which is re∣proved, by the Spirit of truth that leads him. Christ saith, "He shall take of mine, and shew it unto you." Is 'this a measure, yea or nay, from him whom God gave the Spirit not by measure unto?</P>
<P>Again the Lord said, both by his prophet, Joel ii. 28, and his apostle, Acts ii. 17, 18. <Q>It shall come to pass in the last days, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants and on my hand∣maidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</Q> Look, ye deceivers; here the Lord saith, he will pour of his Spirit: mark the word OF the Lord's Spirit upon all flesh. What! young men, old men, sons and daughters, and maids, all these to have the Spirit of God poured upon them? Here, say they, these deny the means then. Nay, that's the means. And the great and notable day of the Lord is coming, wherein it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. The God of the spirits of all flesh is known: and, saith the apostle, who would not boast of things beyond his measure, <Q>That which may be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them,</Q> Rom. i. 19. By this which was of God manifest in them, they knew covetousness, malice, murder, deceit, and ungodliness; knew that the judgments of God were upon such things; and that they were worthy of death; not only that did the same, but who had pleasure in them that did them. Therefore, said the abostle, <Q>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,</Q> &amp;c. Now this of God manifest in them, which God shewed unto them, by which they know unrighteousness, and God's judg∣ments thereupon, and that they which commit such things are worthy of death; whether this be a measure, yea or nay, which is of God, and which he hath shewed to them? What was that in them, that <Q>did by nature the things con∣tained in the law, which shewed the work of the law written in their hearts,</Q> Rom. ii. 14, 15. Mark, "writ∣ten:"
<PB N="298" REF="037441_0375_100D906255209D78"/>shall not this judge them that have the outward law, but are out of the life of it? The apostle saith, <Q>The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</Q> 1 Cor. xii. 7. There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; the manifestation of it is given to <Q>every man</Q> to profit withal. Mark, <Q>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another the word of know∣ledge by the same Spirit: to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit: to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, di∣viding to every man severally as he will.</Q> Mark that, To every man severally as he will.</P>
<P>Again the apostle saith, <Q>The grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,</Q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now ye that turn from this grace, which brings salvation, into lasciviousness, ye deny it, and say, that which teacheth the saints, who by grace are saved, hath not appeared to all men. Jude saith, <Q>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him,</Q> ver. 15. Here mark again; him that cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to convince all of their ungodly deeds and hard speeches: here it is, ALL of their ungodly deeds; and ALL of their hard speeches; none left out, but ALL to be con∣vinced and judged, the world reproved, by him who comes with ten thousands of his saints, and will reign, and be king and judge. And have not ye all something in you, that doth reprove you for your hard speeches, and your ungodly deeds, the ungodliest of you all, who live in your hard speeches against him, and against his light and spi∣ritual appearance in his people.</P>
<P>Again, the apostle, writing to the Gentiles, saith, <Q>But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the mea∣sure of the gift of Christ,</Q> Ephes. iv. 7. Now mark, Here is the measure of the gift of Christ. <Q>who lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> Joh. i. 9. <Q>that
<PB N="299" REF="037441_0376_100D9063E6CDAB88"/>all men through him might believe. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned, &amp;c. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,</Q> &amp;c. Joh. iii. 18, 19. Now every man that cometh into the world being enlightened, one loveth it, and brings his deeds to the light, that with the light he may see whether they be wrought in God: the other hates the light, "because his deeds are evil;" he will not bring his deeds to the light, because he knows the light will reprove him. So he that hates the light, wherewith Christ hath enlightened him, knows the light will reprove him for his evil deeds; and therefore he will not come to the light.</P>
<P>Again, the Lord by his prophet saith concerning Christ, <Q>I will give him for a light to the Gentiles, that he may be my salvation to the ends of the earth,</Q> Isa. xlix. 6. And what is that which the children, that walk according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the <Q>spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,</Q> Ephes. ii. 2. are disobedient to? Mark, and read yourselves, who, being disobedient, walk according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air; Mark, I say, what it is that all such are disobedient to? He that hath an ear, let him hear. The apostle saith to the Colossians, <Q>The wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience,</Q> Col. iii. 6. Come, ye professors, let us see, Is not this something of God that is disobeyed? Is it not that which is of God manifest in them, which God hath shewed them, which lets them see God's judgments are upon such, when they act unrighteously? Is not this the measure of God, the Spirit that is in prison? and the Spirit of God that is grieved?</P>
<P>And ye professors, come, let us read the parable of the talents, and reckon with you, and see who it is that hath hid the Lord's money in the earth? Come, ye that have gained, enter ye into your master's joy. Go, thou that hast hid the Lord's money in the earth, into utter dark∣ness; "take if from him, and give it to him that hath:" every man shall have his reward. For the Lord hath given to "every man according to his several ability," Mat. xxv. 15. Mark that, <Q>To every man according to his several ability:</Q> Read this, if you can. Now is the Lord coming to call every man severally to account, to
<PB N="300" REF="037441_0377_100D9066A4671398"/>'whom he hath given severally, according to their ability. Now the wicked and slothful servant, who hid the Lord's money in the earth, will be found out; and the Lord's money will be taken from him, although he hath hidden it. To him the Lord's commands have been grievous; but to us they are not, who love God and keep his com∣mandments. "And," saith the apostle to the Romans, <Q>I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think: but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith,</Q> Rom. xii. 3. Read and mark, here is a measure of faith.</P>
<P>"And." saith another apostle, <Q>as every man hath re∣ceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as stewards of the manifold grace of God,</Q> 1 Pet. iv. 10. "For the grace of God hath appeared to all men." the good stewards can give their account with joy: but ye bad stewards, that turn from the grace of God into lascivious∣ness, ye will be reckoned withal; ye shall have your re∣ward. "But," say the world, <Q>must every one minister as he hath received the gift?</Q> Yea, say I, <Q>but let him speak as the oracles of God; and let him do it as of the ability which God giveth,</Q> ver. 11. John in the Reve∣lation saith, <Q>They were judged every man according to their works,</Q> Rev. xx. 13. Christ saith, <Q>Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment,</Q> Mat. xii. 36. <Q>Ye that name the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</Q> 2 Tim. ii. 19. <Q>The Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he shall reward every man ac∣cording to his works.</Q> Mat. xvi.

So let the light, which cometh from Christ, examine; for the Lord is appearing. Ye that have recoved according to your ability, smite not your fellow-servant.

<P>The apostle tells the Ephesians, that unto him <Q>this
<PB N="301" REF="037441_0378_100D906954F1A9F0"/>grace was given—to make all men see what is the fellow∣ship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ,</Q> Eph. iii. 9. Read and understand every one with the light which comes from Christ, the mystery; which will be your condemnation, if ye believe not in it. This is to all who stumble at the work of the Spirit of God, the manifestation of it, <Q>which is given to every man to profit withal.</Q> Come, ye professors, who stumble at it; let us read the parables. <Q>A sower went forth to sow; and some seed fell on the highway-ground, and some on stony ground, and some on thorny ground: the seed is the Word, the Son of Man is the seedsman. He that hath an ear, let him hear,</Q> Mat. xiii. Now look, all ye professors, what ground ye are? And what ye have brought forth? And whether the wicked seedsman hath not got his seed into your ground? <Q>He that hath an ear, let him hear it.</Q> And come, read another parable of the householder hiring labourers to go into the vine∣yard, and agreeing with every man for a penny, Mat. xx. Every man is to have his penny; the last that went in, as well as the first; <Q>and the last shall be first, and the first shall be last; for many are called, but few are cho∣sen.

<P>The Lord said, he would make a new covenant, by <Q>writing his law in people's hearts, and putting his Spirit in their inward parts,</Q> whereby they should all come to know the Lord, by whom the world was made. Now every one of you mind the law written in your hearts, and this Spirit put in your inward parts, that it need not be said to you, "Know the Lord:" but that ye may wit∣ness the promise of God fulfilled in you. But, say the world and professors, "If every one must come to witness
<PB N="302" REF="037441_0379_100D9113BA4F3B18"/>the law of God written in their hearts, and the Spirit put in the inward parts, "what must we do with all our teachers?" As we come to witness that, we need not any man to teach us to know the Lord, having his law written in our hearts, and his Spirit put in our inward parts. This is the covenant of life, the everlasting covenant, which decays not, nor changes not: and here is the way to the Father, without which no man cometh unto the Father. Here is the ever∣lasting priesthood, the end of the old priesthood, whose lips were to preserve knowledge; but now, saith Christ, "Learn of me:" who is the high-priest, of the new priest∣hood. And, saith the apostle,— <Q>That ye may grow up in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, in whom are hid the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</Q> So we are brought off from the old priesthood that did change, to Christ, to the new priesthood that doth not change; off from the first covenant that doth decay, to the everlasting covenant that doth not decay, Christ Jesus, the Covenant of Light, from whom every one of you have a light, that ye might believe in the Covenant of Light. If ye do not believe, ye are condemned; for light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil. "I am come a light into the world," saith Christ, <Q>that whosoever believeth in me should not abide in darkness, but have the light of life,</Q> John xii. 46. "Believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light" Ye who do not believe in the light, but hate it because it manifests your deeds to be evil, ye are condemned by the light. Therefore while ye have time, prize it. Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is nigh; lest ye say, "Time is past:" for the rich glut∣ton's time was past. Therefore, while time is not quite past, consider, search yourselves, and see if you be not they that hate the light, and so are builders that stumble at the corner-stone; for they that hated the light, and did not believe in the light, did so in ages past. <Q>I am the light of the world,</Q> saith Christ, "who," the apostle saith, "doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world." Christ also saith, "Learn of me;" and of him God saith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." Here is your Teacher. But ye that hate the light do not learn of Christ, will not have him to be your king to reign over you; him, to whom all power in heaven and earth is giv∣en, who bears his government upon his shoulders, who is
<PB N="303" REF="037441_0380_100D7F75C470CB88"/>now come to reign, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, who will give to every man a reward ac∣cording to his works, whether they be good or evil. So every man, with the light that comes from Christ, will see his deeds, both he that hates it and he that loves it. And he that will not bring his deeds to the light, because the light will reprove him, that is his condemnation; and he shall have a reward according to his deeds. For the Lord is come to reckon with you. He looks for fruits; the ax is laid to your root; and every tree of you, that bears not good fruit, must be hewn down and cast into the fire.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having staid some time in London, and visited the meet∣ings of friends in and about the city, and cleared myself of what services the Lord had at the time laid upon me there, I left the town and travelled into Kent, Sussex, and Sur∣ry, visiting friends; amongst whom I had great meetings, and often met with opposition from Baptists and other jangling professors; but the Lord's power went over them.</P>
<P>We lay one night at Farnham, where we had a little meet∣ing. The people were exceeding rude; but at last the Lord's power came over them. After meeting we went to our inn, and gave notice, <Q>That any who feared God might come to our inn to us.</Q> There came abundance of rude people, the magistrates of the town, and some professors. I declared the truth to them; and those of the people that be∣haved themselves rudely, the magistrates put out of the room. When they were gone, another rude company of professors came up, and some of the chief of the town. They called for faggots and drink, though we forbad them, and were as rude a people as ever I met withal. The Lord's power chained them, that they had not power to do us any mischief; but when they went away they left all the faggots and beer, which they had called for into the room, for us to pay for in the morning. We shewed the innkeep∣er what an unworthy thing it was; but he told us, <Q>we must pay it;</Q> and pay it we did. Before we left the town, I wrote to the magistrates and heads of the town, and to the priest, shewing them how he had taught his people, and laying before them their rude and uncivil carriage to strangers that sought their good.</P>
<P>Leaving that place we came to Basingstoke, a very rude town; where they had formerly very much abused friends.
<PB N="304" REF="037441_0381_100D7F784C054540"/>There I had a meeting in the evening, which was quiet; for the Lord's power chained the unruly. At the close of the meeting I was moved to put off my hat, and to pray to the Lord to open their understandings; upon which they raised a report, <Q>That I put off my hat to them, and bid them good night,</Q> which was never in my heart. After the meet∣ing, when we came to our inn, I sent for the innkeeper, as I used to do; and he came into the room to us, and shew∣ed himself a very rude man. I admonished him to be so∣ber, and fear the Lord; but he called for faggots and a pint of wine, and drank it off himself; then called for another, and called up half a dozen men into our chamber. Thereup∣on I bid him go out of the chamber, and told him he should not drink there; for we sent for him up to speak to him con∣cerning his eternal good. He was exceeding mad, rude, and drunk. When he continued his rudeness and would not be gone, I told him, <Q>The chamber was mine for the time I lodged in it;</Q> and called for the key. Then he went away in a rage. In the morning he would not be seen; but I told his wife of his unchristian carriage towards us.</P>
<P>After this we came to Bridport, having meetings in the way. We went to an inn, and sent into the town for such as feared God; and there came a shopkeeper, a professor, and put off his hat to us: and seeing we did not the like to him again, but said Thou and Thee to him, he told us, 'He was not of our religion;' and after some discourse he went away. After awhile he sent to the inn to us, to de∣sire us 'to come to his house, for some would speak with us.' Thomas Curtis went to his house; where when he came, the man had got the priest and magistrates thither, and they boasted much that they had catched George Fox, taking him for me. When they perceived their mistake they were very angry; yet the Lord's power came over them, so that they let him go again. Mean while I had an opportunity of speaking to some sober people that came to the inn. When Thomas was returned, and we were passing out of the town, some came to us, and said, <Q>The officers were coming to fetch me;</Q> but the Lord's power was over them, so that they had not power to touch me. There were some con∣vinced in the town who were turned to the Lord, and have stood faithful in their testimony to the truth ever since, and a sine meeting is settled there.</P>
<P>Passing from hence we visited Portsmouth and Pool, where we had glorious meetings; and many were turned to
<PB N="305" REF="037441_0382_100D7F7ADD295CD0"/>the Lord. At Ringwood we had a large general meeting, where the Lord's power was over all. At Weymouth we had a meeting; and from thence came through Dorchester to Lime, where the inn we went to was taken up with mountebanks, so that there was hardly any room for us or our horses. In the evening we drew up some queries con∣cerning the ground of all diseases, and the nature and virtues of medicinable creatures, and sent them to the mountebanks; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting them know, <Q>If they would not an∣swer them, we would stick them on the cross next day.</Q> This brought them down and made them cool, for they could not answer them; but in the morning they reasoned a little with us. We left the queries with some friendly people that were convinced in the town, to stick upon the market-cross. The Lord's power reached some of the sober people in that place, who were turned by the Light and Spirit of Christ to his free teaching.</P>
<P>We then travelled to Exeter; and at the Seven Stars, an inn at the bridge foot, we had a general meeting of friends out of Cornwall and Devonshire; to which came Humphry Lower, Thomas Lower, and John Ellis from the Land's∣end, Henry Pollexfen, with friends from Plymouth, Eli∣zabeth Trelawny, and divers other friends. A blessed hea∣venly meeting we had, and the Lord's everlasting power came over all; in which I saw, and said, <Q>That the Lord's power had surrounded this nation round about as with a wall and bulwark, and his seed reached from sea to sea.</Q> Friends were established in the everlasting feed of life, Christ Jesus, their life, rock, teacher, and shepherd.</P>
<P>The next morning, major Blackmore sent soldiers to ap∣prehend me; but I was gone before they came. As I was riding up the street, I saw the officers going down. So the Lord crossed their design, and friends passed away peacea∣bly and quietly. The soldiers examined some friends after I was gone, 'What they did there?' but when they told them, <Q>They were in their inn, and had business in the city,</Q> they passed away without meddling any further with them.</P>
<P>From Exeter I took meetings as I went, till I came to Bristol; and was at the meeting there. After it was done I did not stay in the town, but passed into Wales, and had a meeting at the Slone. Thence going to Cardiff, a justice of peace sent to me, desiring, <Q>I would come with half a dozen of my friends to his house,</Q> So I took a friend or
<PB N="306" REF="037441_0383_100D7F7C61E45888"/>two and went to him, and he and his wife received us very civilly. The next day we had a meeting in Cardiff in the town-hall; to which that justice sent about seventeen of his family. There came some disturbers, but the Lord's power was over them; and many were turned to the Lord. To some who had run out with James Nayler, and forsook meetings, I had to send word, <Q>That the day of their visit∣ation was over;</Q> and they never prospered after.</P>
<P>We travelled from Cardiff to Swansea, where we had a blessed meeting; and a meeting was settled there in the name of Jesus. In our way thither we passed over in a passage-boat with the high sheriff of the county. The next day I went to have spoken with him, but he refused.</P>
<P>We went to another meeting in the country; where the Lord's presence was much with us. From thence we went to a great man's house, who received us very lovingly; but the next morning he would not be seen: one, that in the mean time came to him, had so estranged him, that we could not get to speak with him again.</P>
<P>We passed through the countries, having meetings, and gathering people in the name of Christ, their heavenly teacher, till we came to Brecknock; where we set up our horses at an inn. There went with me Thomas Holmes, and John-ap-John, who was moved of the Lord to <Q>speak in the streets.</Q> I walked out but a little into the fields; and when I returned the town was in an uproar. When I came into the chamber in the inn, it was full of people, and they were speaking in Welch. I desired them to speak in English, which they did; and much discourse we had. After awhile they went away. Towards night the magis∣trates gathered in the streets with a multitude of people, and they bid them shout, and gathered up the town; so that, for about two hours together, there was such a noise as the like we had not heard; and the magistrates set them on to shout again when they had given over. We thought it looked like the uproar, which we read was amongst Diana's craftsmen. This tumult continued till it was within night, and if the Lord's power had not limited them, they seemed likely to have pulled down the house, and us to pieces.</P>
<P>At night the woman of the house would have had us go to supper in another room; but we, discerning her plot, refused. Then she would have had half a dozen men come into the room to us, under pretence of discoursing with us.
<PB N="307" REF="037441_0384_100D7F81F6BF0B90"/>We told her, <Q>No person should come into our room that night, neither would we go to them.</Q> Then she said, we should 'sup in another room;' but we told her, we would have no supper if we had it not in our own room. At length, when she saw she could not get us out, she brought up our supper. So she and they were crossed in their de∣sign; for they had an intent to have done us mischief, but the Lord prevented them. Next morning I wrote a paper to the town concerning their unchristian carriage, shewing the fruits of their priests and magistrates; and as I passed out of town I spoke to the people, and told them, They were a shame to Christianity and religion.</P>
<P>From this place we went to a great meeting in a steeple-house yard; where was a priest, and Walter Jenkin, who had been a justice, and another justice. A blessed glorious meeting we had. There being many professors, I was mov∣ed of the Lord to open the <Q>scriptures to them, and to answer the objections which they stuck at in their profes∣sion (for I knew them very well;) and to turn them to Christ, who had enlightened them; with which light they might see the sins and trespasses they had been dead in, and their Saviour who came to redeem them out of them, who was to be their way to God, the truth and the life to them, and their priest made higher than the heavens; so that they might come to sit under his teaching.</Q> A peace∣able meeting we had; many were convinced, and settled in the truth that day. After the meeting, I went with Walter Jenkin to the other justice's, who said to me, <Q>You have this day given great satisfaction to the people, and answer∣ed all the objections that were in their minds.</Q> For the people had the scriptures, but they were not turned to the Spirit, which should let them see that which gave them forth, the Spirit of God, which is the key to open them.</P>
<P>From hence we passed to Richard Hamborow's at Ponte∣moil, where was a great meeting; to which there came an∣other justice, and several great people; whose understand∣ings were opened by the Lord's Spirit and power, and they were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, from whence it came. A great convincement there was; a large meeting is gather∣ed in those parts, and settled in the name of Jesus.</P>
<P>After this returning to England, we came to Shrewsbury, where we had a great meeting; and visited friends up and down the country in their meetings, till we came to Wil∣liam Gandy's, in Cheshire, where we had a meeting of be∣tween
<PB N="308" REF="037441_0385_100D7FD6EF9820B8"/>two and three thousand people, as it was thought; and the everlasting word of life was held forth, and received that day. A blessed meeting it was; for friends were settled by the power of God upon Jesus Christ, the rock and foun∣dation.</P>
<P>At this time there was a great drought; and after this general meeting was ended there fell so great a rain, that friends said, They thought we could not travel, the waters would be so risen. But I believed the rain had not gone so far as they had come that day to the meeting. The next day in the afternoon, when we turned back into some parts of Wales again, the ways were dusty, and no rain had fallen thereabouts.</P>
<P>When Oliver Cromwel set forth a proclamation for a fast throughout the nation for rain, in a very great drought, it was observed, that as far as truth had spread in the north, there were pleasant showers and rain enough; yet the south, in many places, was almost spoiled for want of rain. At that time I was moved to write an answer to the Pro∣tector's proclamation; wherein I told him: <Q>If he had come to own God's truth, he should have had rain; and that drought was to them a sign of their barrenness, and want of the water of life.</Q></P>
<P>About the same time was wrote the following paper to 'distinguish betwixt the true and false fasts.'</P>
<P>Concerning the true Fasts and the false.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TO all you that are keeping fasts, who "smite with the fist of wickedness, and fast for strife and debate;" against you hath the voice cried aloud, like a trumpet, that you may come to know the true fast which is accepted, and the fast which is in the strife and the debate, and smiting with the fist of wickedness:" which fast is not re∣quired of the Lord. <Q>Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labour: behold, ye fast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness, ye shall not fast, as ye do this day, to make your voice known on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen,</Q> saith the Lord, <Q>a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth under him? Wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord?</Q></P>
<P>Consider all you that fast, see if it be not <Q>hanging
<PB N="309" REF="037441_0386_100D7FD9C61CE160"/>down the head for a day like a bulrush,</Q> and fasting for "strife and debate", and to <Q>smite with the fists of wicked∣ness, to make your voice to be known on high?</Q> But this fast is not accepted with the Lord; but that which leads you from strife, from debate, from wickedness; which is not the <Q>bowing down of the head as a bulrush for a day,</Q> and yet live in exacting and pleasure; this is not ac∣cepted with the Lord: but that which separates from all these before-mentioned. That which separates from <Q>wickedness, debate, strife, pleasures, smiting with the fist of wickedness,</Q> brings to know the true fast, which <Q>breaks the bonds of iniquity, and deals bread to the hun∣gry; brings the poor that are cast out to his own house; and when he sees any naked he covers them, and hides not himself from his own flesh.</Q> Here is the true fast which separates from them, where the bonds of iniquity are standing, the heavy burthens of the oppressed remain∣ing, and the yoke not broken; who deal not bread to the hungry, and bring not the poor to their own house; and see the naked but let him go unclothed, and hide them∣selves from their own flesh. Yet such will make their voice to be heard on high, as Christ speaks of the phari∣sces, who <Q>sounded a trumpet before them, and disfr∣gured their faces,</Q> to appear to men to fast; but the bonds of iniquity were standing, strife and debate was standing, striking with the fists of wickedness standing; those made their voice heard on high, who had their reward.</P>
<P>But that which brings to the true fast, which appears not to men to fast, but unto the Father <Q>who sees in secret; the Father that seeth in secret shall reward this openly.</Q> This fast separates from the pharisees fast, and them that "bow the head for a day like a bulrush." This is it which brings <Q>to deal bread to the hungry, and to clothe thine own flesh when thou seest them naked, to bring the poor to thine house, and to loose the bonds of wickedness:</Q> mark, this is the fast; and <Q>to undo every heavy burden (mark again) and to let the oppreissed go free;</Q> this is the fast: and "to break every yoke." When thou observest this fast, <Q>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth spee∣dily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glo∣ry of the Lord shall be thy rere-ward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am: if thou take away from the
<PB N="310" REF="037441_0387_100D906AE6B38438"/>midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity: and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall thy light arise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon-day.</Q> The light brings to know this fast; and walking in it, this fast is kept: and he that believeth in the light, abides not in darkness. And again; <Q>The Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not,</Q> Isa. lviii. 11. These are they that are guided with the light, which comes from Christ where the springs are.</P>
<P>And again: <Q>They that shall be of thee (that keep this fast) shall build the old waste places, and thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generations; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in,</Q> Isa. lviii. 12. Now that which gives to see the foundation of many generations, is the light which separates from all that which is out of the light; and they that go out of the light, though they may pretend a fast, and bowing down the head for a time: yet they are far from this fast, that doth raise up the foundation of many gene∣rations, and is the repairer of the breach, and restorer of the paths to dwell in. That which doth give to see this foundation of many generations, and these breaches that are to be repaired and restored, and paths to dwell in, is the light which brings to know the true fast; and where this fast is known, which is from wickedness, from debate, from strife, from pleasures, from exacting, from the voice that is heard on high, from the speaking of vanity, from the bonds of iniquity, which breaks every yoke, and lets the oppressed go free; here the health grows, here the morning is known, righteousness goes forth; the glory of the Lord is the rere-ward, the light riseth, the soul is drawn out to the hungry, and satisfies the afflicted soul; and the springs of living water are known and felt. The waters fail not here; the Lord guides continually, and the foundation of many generations comes to be seen and rais∣ed up: the repairer of breaches is here witnessed, the res∣torer of paths to dwell in.</P>
<P>But all such as are out of the light which the prophets were in, with which they saw Christ, and such to be in fasts where was strife, where was wickedness, where was debate, where was <Q>bowing the head like a bulrush for a
<PB N="311" REF="037441_0388_100D906C7A016550"/>day,</Q> lifting their voice on high, and the bonds of wick∣edness yet standing, the burdens unloosed, the oppressed not let go free, the yoke not broken, the nakedness not clothed, the bread not dealt to the hungry, and this foundation of many generations not raised up: until these things before-mentioned be broken down, on such the light breaks not forth as the morning, and the Lord hears them not. Such have their reward; their iniquities have separated them from their God, their sins have hid his face from them that he will not hear, their hands are de∣filed with blood, and their fingers with iniquity; whose lips have spoken lies, and tongues have muttered per∣verseness. <Q>None calleth for justice, nor any plead for truth; they trust in vanity and speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs, dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a vi∣per; their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works.</Q> Mark and take notice: <Q>Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands: their feet run to do evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and destruction are in their paths; the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their doings. They have made them a crooked path; whosoever goes therein shall not know peace:</Q> mark: Such go from the light, therefore is judg∣ment far off, neither doth justice overtake. Here is ob∣scurity, here is the walking in darkness, here is the grop∣ing like blind men, as though they had no eyes, and their stumbling at noon-day in desolate places, like blind men. Here is the roaring like bears, and mourning sorely like doves; here judgment is looked for, but there is none, and salvation is put far off: for the light is denied, which gives to see it. But here is the multiplying of transgres∣sion, and their sins testifying against them, and the trans∣gression that was within them, and their iniquities which they knew in transgressing and lying against the Lord, speaking the things they should not; when they knew by that of God in them, they should not speak it. So de∣parting from the way of God, speaking oppression, re∣volting, conceiving and uttering forth from the heart words of falsehood; here judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands afar off: truth is fallen in the streets, and
<PB N="312" REF="037441_0389_100D906EDD1079B8"/>equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth; and he that de∣parteth from evil, makes himself a prey! The Lord saw it, and it displeased him. These are such as are in the fast which God doth not accept; and are not in the true fast, whose "light breaks forth as the morning:" but these are such as are in the false fast. who grope like blind men.</P>
<P>That which gives to know the true and false fast, is the light, which gives the eye to see each fast; where the true judgment is, and the iniquity standeth not, nor the transgressor, nor the speaker of lies: but that is judged 'and condemned with the light, which makes it manifest. And those who are in this fast, when they call upon the Lord, the Lord will answer them, "Here am I." Here truth is pleaded for and falsehood flies away. But they who are out of this fast in the perverseness, their tongues uttering perverse things, are stumbling and groping like blind men, out of the light, in the iniquity which sepa∣rates from God, who hides his face from them that he will not hear: going from the light, they go from the Lord and his face. So this is it which must be fast∣ed from, for this it is which separates from God: and here comes the reward openly, which condemns all that which is contrary to the light; injustice, iniquity, trasgression, vanity, that which brings forth mischief; which hatcheth the cockatrice-eggs, and weaves the spi∣ders web: he that eateth of these eggs, dies. Mark, That "which is crushed breaks out into a viper." Mark again, <Q>Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works of vanity: acts of violence are in their hands.</Q> This is all from the light, in the wickedness. <Q>Their seet run to do evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of vanity, wasting and destruction is in their path.</Q> This is all far from the light. Again. <Q>The way of peace they know not, there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goes therein shall not know peace.</Q> Mark; who goes in their way, that know not the way of peace, shall they know peace? <Q>Whose path is crooked, where there is no judgment in their goings:</Q> take notice, <Q>No judg∣ment in their goings:</Q> This is all from the light, which ma∣nifesteth that which is to be judged; where the covenant of peace is known, where all that which is contrary to it is kept out. All who live in those things contrary to the
<PB N="313" REF="037441_0390_100D9071318AA5D0"/>light, in the false fast, may mark their path, and behold their reward; who are out of the light, stumbling and groping like blind men. They that be in the true fast are separated from all these; their words, their actions and fruits, and their fast; but to those whose fast breaks the bonds of iniquity, whom the Lord hears, and to whom righteousness springs forth, and goes before them, the glory of the Lord is their rere-ward.</P>

<P>We passed into Wales through Montgomeryshire, and so into Radnorshire, where there was a meeting like a leaguer, for multitudes. I walked a little aside, whilst the people were gathering: and there came to me John-ap-John, a Welshman, whom I desired to go to the people; and if he had any thing upon him from the Lord to them, he might speak in Welsh, and thereby gather more together. Then came Morgan Watkins to me, who was become loving to friends, and said, <Q>The people lie like a leaguer, and the gentry of the country are come in.</Q> I bade him go up also, and leave me; for I had a great travail upon me for the salvation of the people. When they were well ga∣thered, I went into the meeting, and stood upon a chair about three hours. I stood a pretty while, before I geban to speak: after some time I felt the power of the Lord over the whole assembly: and his everlasting life and truth shined over all. <Q>The scriptures were opened to them, and the objections they had in their minds answered. They were directed to the light of Christ, the heavenly man; that by it they might see their sins, and Christ Jesus to be their Saviour, their Redeemer, their Mediator, and come to seed upon him, the bread of life from heaven. Many were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to his free teach∣ing that day; and all were bowed down under the power of God; so that though the multitude was so great that many sat on horseback to hear, there was no opposition. A priest sat with his wife on horseback, heard attentively, and made no objection. The people parted peaceably, with great satisfaction; many of them saying, They never heard such a sermon before, nor the scriptures so opened. For the new covenant was opened, and the old, the na∣ture and terms of each, and the parables were explained. The state of the church in the apostles days was set forth, the apostacy since laid open; and the free teaching of
<PB N="314" REF="037441_0391_100D9072C7FBE648"/>Christ and the apostles was set atop of all the hireling teach∣ers; and the Lord had the praise of all, for many were turned to him that day.</Q></P>
<P>I went from thence to Leominster, where was a great meeting in a close; many hundreds of people being gather∣ed together. There were about six congregational preach∣ers and priests amongst the people; and Thomas Taylor, who had been a priest, but was now become a minister of Christ Jesus, was with me. I stood up, and declared about three hours; and none of the priests were able to open their mouths in opposition; the Lord's power and truth so reached and bound them. At length one priest went off about a bow-shot from me; drew several of the people after him, and began to preach to them. So I kept our meet∣ing, and he kept his. After awhile Thomas Taylor was moved to go and speak to him; upon which he gave over: and he, with the people he had drawn off, came to us again; and the Lord's power went over all. At last a Baptist, that was convinced, said, <Q>Where's priest Tombs? how chance he doth not come out?</Q> This Tombs was priest of Leominster. Hereupon some went and told the priest; who came with the bailiffs and other officers of the town. When he was come, they set him upon a stool over against me. I was speaking of the heavenly, divine light of Christ, which he <Q>enlightens every one withal that com∣eth into the world; to give them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus their Saviour.</Q> When priest Tombs heard this, he cried out, <Q>That is a natural light, and a made light.</Q> Then I desired the peo∣ple to take out their bibles, and asked the priest, <Q>Whether he did affirm that was a created, natural, made light, which John, a man sent from God, bore witness to, when he said, <Q>In him (to wit, in the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men,</Q> John i. 4. Dost thou affirm and mean, said I, that this light here spoken of was a created, natural, made light? He said, Yes. Then I shewed by the scriptures, that the natural, created, made light is the out∣ward light in the outward firmament, proceeding from the fun, moon, and stars? "And dost thou affirm," said I, <Q>that God sent John to bear witness to the light of the sun, moon, and stars?</Q> "Then," said he, "Did I say so?" I replied, <Q>Didst thou not say it was a natural, created, made light, that John bore witness unto? If thou dost not like thy words, take them again, and mend them.</Q>
<PB N="315" REF="037441_0392_100D90745B7BFED8"/>Then he said <Q>That light, which I spoke of, was a na∣tural, created light.</Q> I told him, He had not at all mended his cause; for that light, which I spoke of, was the very same that John was sent of God to bear witness to; which was the life in the Word, by which all the na∣tural lights, sun, moon, and stars, were made.</Q> <Q>In him (to wit, the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men.</Q> I directed the people to turn to the place in their bibles, and recited to them the words of John, <Q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</Q> (So all natural, created lights were made by Christ the Word.) <Q>In him was life, and the life was the light of men: and that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</Q> And Christ saith of himself, John viii. 12. 'I am the light of the world:' and bids them 'believe in the light,' John xii. 36. And God said of him by the prophet Isaiah, ch. xlix. 6. <Q>I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the ends of the earth.</Q> So Christ in his light is saving. And the apostle said, <Q>The light, which shined in their hearts, was to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ:</Q> which was their treasure in their earthen vessels, 2 Cor. iv. 6, 7.</P>
<P>When I had thus opened the matter to the people, the priest cried to the magistrates, <Q>Take this man away, or else I shall not speak any more.</Q> 'But,' said I, <Q>priest Tombs, deceive not thyself, thou art not in thy pulpit now, nor in thy old mass-house; but we are in the fields.</Q> So he was shuffling to be gone: and Thomas Taylor stood up, and undertook to prove our principle by Christ's para∣ble concerning the sower, Mat. 13. Then said the priest, 'Let that man speak, and not the other.' So he got up into jangling for awhile; till the Lord's power catched him again, stopped and confounded him. Afterwards a friend stood up and told him, He had sued him for tithe eggs, and other friends for other tithes: for he was an Anabaptist preacher, yet had a parsonage at Leominster, and had se∣veral journeymen under him. He said, <Q>He had a wife, and he had a concubine; his wife was the baptized people, and his concubine was the world.</Q> But the Lord's power
<PB N="316" REF="037441_0393_100D90770B6F5670"/>came over all, the everlasting truth was declared that day, and many were turned by it to the Lord Jesus Christ, their teacher and way to God. Of great service that meeting was in those parts. The next day Thomas Taylor went to this priest, reasoned with him, and overcame him by the power of the Word.</P>
<P>From this place I travelled in Wales, having several meetings, till I came to Tenby; where as I rode up the street, a justice of peace came out of his house, desired me to alight, and stay at his house; which I did. On first-day the mayor with his wife, and several others of the chief of the town, came in about the tenth hour, and staid all the time of the meeting. A glorious meeting it was. John-ap-John being then with me, left the meeting, and went to the steeple-house; and the governor cast him into prison. On second-day morning the governor sent one of his officers to the justice's to fetch me; which grieved the mayor and the justice; for they were both with me in the justice's house, when the officer came. The mayor and the justice went to the governor before me; and awhile af∣ter I went with the officer. When I came in I said, 'Peace be unto this house.' And before the governor could examine me, I asked him, <Q>Why he cast my friend into prison?</Q> He said, <Q>For standing with his hat on in the church.</Q> I said, <Q>Had not the priest two caps on his head, a black one and a white one? Cut off the brims of the hat, and then my friend would have but one; and the brims of the hat were but to defend him from weather.</Q> 'These are frivolous things,' said the governor. <Q>Why then,</Q> said I. <Q>dost thou cast my friend into prison for such frivolous things?</Q> He asked me, <Q>Whether I owned election and reprobation?</Q> 'Yes,' said I, <Q>and thou art in the reprobation.</Q> At that he was in a rage, and said, 'He would send me to prison till I proved it.' I told him, <Q>I would prove that quickly, if he would confess truth.</Q> I asked him, <Q>Whether wrath, fury, rage, and persecution. were not marks of reprobation? for he that was born of the flesh, persecuted him that was born of the Spirit; but Christ and his disciples never persecuted nor imprisoned any.</Q> He fairly confessed, That he had too much wrath, haste, and passion in him. I told him, <Q>Esau was up in him, the first birth; not Jacob, the second birth.</Q> The Lord's power so reached the man, and came
<PB N="317" REF="037441_0394_100D9078FB08C718"/>over him, that he confessed to truth; and the other justice came, and shook me kindly by the hand.</P>
<P>As I was passing away, I was moved to speak to the governor again; and he invited me to dinner with him; and set my friend at liberty. I went back to the other justice's house: and after some time the mayor and his wife, and the jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice and his wife, and divers other friends of the town, went about half a mile out of town with us, to the water-side, when we went away; and there, when we part∣ed from them, I was moved of the Lord to <Q>kneel down with them, and pray to the Lord to preserve them.</Q> So after I had recommended them to the Lord Jesus Christ, their Saviour and free teacher, we passed away in the Lord's power; and he had the glory. A meeting continues in that town to this day.</P>
<P>We travelled to Pembrokeshire; and in Pembroke town had some service for the Lord. From thence we passed to Haverford-west, where we had a great meeting. All was quiet; the Lord's power came over all, many were settled in the new covenant, Christ Jesus, and built upon him, their rock and foundation: and they stand a precious meet∣ing to this day. The next day, being their fair-day, we passed through the fair, and <Q>sounded the day of the Lord, and his everlasting truth amongst them.</Q></P>
<P>After this we came into another county, and at noon into a great market town; and went to several inns, before we could get any meat for our horses. At last we came to one, where we got some. Then John-ap-John being with me, went, and spoke through the town, declaring the truth to the people; and when he came to me again, he said he thought all the town were as people asleep. After awhile he was moved to go and declare truth in the streets again; then the town was all in an uproar, and cast him into prison. Presently after, several of the chief of the town came down, with others, to the inn where I was, and said, 'They have cast your man into prison.' 'For what?' said I. 'He preached in our streets,' said they. I asked them, <Q>What did he say? Had he reproved some of the drunkards and swearers, and warned them to repent, and leave off their evil doings, and turn to the Lord?</Q> I asked them, 'Who cast him into prison?' They said, 'The high-sheriff, the justices, and the mayor.' I asked their names, and whether they understood themselves? and whether that was their carriage to travellers who passed
<PB N="318" REF="037441_0395_100D907A9239DCF0"/>through their town; and to strangers that admonished them, and exhorted them to fear the Lord, and reproved sin in their gates? These went and told the officers what I said; and after awhile they brought John-ap-John guarded with halberds, in order to put him out of the town. I being at the inn-door, bid the officers take their hands off of him. They said, <Q>The mayor and justices had commanded them to put him out of town.</Q> I told them, <Q>I would talk with their mayor and justices anon concerning their un∣civil and unchristian carriage towards him.</Q> I spoke to John to go look after the horses, and get them ready; and charged the officers not to touch him; and after I had de∣clared the truth to them, and shewed the fruits of their priests, and their incivility and unchristian-like carriage, they went away and left us. They were a kind of Inde∣pendents; a very wicked town, and false. We bid the inn-keeper give our horses a peck of oats; and no sooner had we turned our backs, but the oats were stolen from our horses. After we had refreshed ourselves a little, and were ready, we took horse, and rode up to the inn, where the mayor, sheriff, and justices were. I called to speak with them, and asked them the reason, <Q>Wherefore they had imprisoned John-ap-John, and kept him in prison two or three hours?</Q> But they would not answer me a word; only looked out at the windows upon me. I shewed them <Q>how unchristian their carriage was to strangers and travel∣lers, and manifested the fruits of their teachers; and de∣clared the truth to them, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the evil-doers: and the Lord's power came over them, that they looked asha∣med;</Q> but not a word could I get from them in answer. So when I had warned them to repent, and turn to the Lord, we passed away; and at night came to a little inn, very poor, but very cheap; for our own provision, and our two horses cost but eight pence: but the horses would not eat their oats. We declared the truth to the people of the place, and sounded the day of the Lord thro' the countries.</P>
<P>From thence we came to a great town, and went to an inn. Edward Edwards went into the market, and declared the truth amongst the people; who followed him to the inn, silled the inn-yard, and were exceeding rude. Yet a good service we had for the Lord amongst them. For the life of christianity and the power of it tormented their chaffy spi∣rits, and came over them, so that some were reached and
<PB N="319" REF="037441_0396_100D907C8178D0D8"/>convinced; the Lord's power came over all; and the ma∣gistrates were bound, they had no power to meddle with us.</P>
<P>After this we came to another great town on a market-day; where John-ap-John declared the everlasting truth through the streets, and proclaimed the day of the Lord. In the evening many gathered about the inn; and some of them, being drunk, would fain have had us into the street again; but seeing their design, I told them, <Q>If there were any that feared God, and desired to hear truth, they might come into our inn; or else we might have a meeting with them next morning.</Q> Some service for the Lord we had amongst them, both over night and in the morning: and though they were hard to receive the truth, yet the seed was sown; and thereabouts the Lord hath a people gather∣ed to himself. In that inn also I turned my back to the man that was giving oats to my horse; and looking back, he was filling his pockets with the provender. A wicked, thievish people, to rob the poor dumb creature of his food! I had rather they had robbed me.</P>
<P>Leaving this town, and travelling on, a great man over∣took us on the way. He purposed (as he told us afterwards) to have taken us up at the next town for highwaymen. But before we came to the town, I was moved of the Lord to speak to him. What I spoke, reached to the witness of God in the man; who was so affected therewith, that he had us to his house, and entertained us very civilly. He and his wife desired us to give them some scriptures, both for proof of our principles, and against the priests. We were glad of the service, and furnished him with scriptures enough; and he wrote them down, and was convinced of the truth, both by the Spirit of God in his own heart, and by the scriptures, which were a confirmation to him. Af∣terwards he set us on in our journey; and as we travelled, we came to an hill, which the people of the country say is two or three miles high; from the side of this hill I could see a great way. And I was moved to set my face several ways, and to sound the day of the Lord there: and I told John-ap-John (a faithful Welsh minister) in what places God would raise up a people to himself, to sit under his own teaching. Those places he took notice of; and since there hath been a great people arisen there. The like I have been moved to do in many other parts inhabited by rude people: yet I have been moved to declare the Lord had a seed in those places: and afterwards there hath been a brave
<PB N="320" REF="037441_0397_100D907EDC0CE498"/>people raised up in the covenant of God, and gathered in the name of Jesus; where they have salvation and free teaching.</P>
<P>From this hill we came to Dolegelle: and went to an inn. John-ap-John declared through the streets; and the town's people rose and gathered about him. There being two Independent priests in the town, they came out, and discoursed with him both together. I went to them: and finding them speaking in Welsh, I asked them, <Q>What was the subject they spoke upon, and why they were not more moderate, and spoke one by one? For the things of God,</Q> I told them, <Q>were weighty, and they should speak of them with fear and reverence.</Q> Then I desired them to speak in English, that I might discourse with them; and they did so. They affirmed, <Q>That the Light, which John came to bear witness of, was a created, natural, made light.</Q>I took the bible, and shewed them (as I had done to others before) <Q>That the natural lights, which were made and created, were the sun, moon, and stars: but this light, which John bare witness to, and which he called the true light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, is the life in Christ the Word, by which all things were made and created. The same that is called the life in Christ, is called the light in man. This is an heavenly, divine light, which lets men see their evil words and deeds, and shews them all their sins; and (if they would attend to it) would bring them to Christ, from whom it comes, that they might know him to save them from their sin, and to blot it out. This light, I told them, shined in the darkness in their hearts, and the darkness in them could not comprehend it; but in those hearts, where God had commanded it to shine out of darkness, it gave unto such the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus their Saviour. I opened the scriptures largely to them, and turned them to the Spirit of God in their hearts; which would reveal the mysteries in the scriptures to them, and would lead them into all truth, as they became sub∣ject thereunto. I directed them to that which would give every one of them the knowledge of Christ, who died for them; that he might be their way to God, and might make peace betwixt God and them.</Q> The people were attentive, and I desired John-ap-John to stand up, and speak it in Welsh to them; which he did: and they gene∣rally received it, and with hands lifted up, blessed and prais∣ed
<PB N="321" REF="037441_0398_100D9080D5B5E838"/>God. The priests mouths were stopped, so that they were quiet all the while; for I had brought them to be so∣ber at the first, by telling them, <Q>when they spoke of the things of God and of Christ, they should speak with fear and reverence.</Q> Thus the meeting broke up in peace in the street. Many of the people accompanied us to our inn, re∣joiced in the truth that had been declared to them; and that they were turned to the light and Spirit in themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, by which they might see their sin, and know salvation from it. When we went out of the twon, the people were so affected, that they lifted up their hands, and blessed the Lord for our coming. A precious seed the Lord hath there-away; and a great people in those parts is since gathered to the Lord Jesus Christ, to sit under his free teaching; and they have suffered much for him.</P>
<P>From this place we passed to Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnarvon, a town like a castle. When we had set up our horses at an inn, and re∣freshed ourselves, John-ap-John went and spoke through the streets; which were so straight and short, that one might stand in the midst of the town, and see both the gates. I followed John-ap-John, and a multitude were soon gather∣ed about him; amongst whom a very dark priest began to babble; but his mouth was soon stopped. When John had cleared himself, I declared the word of life amongst the people; <Q>directing them to the light of Christ in their hearts, that by it they might see all their own ways, religions, and teachers, and might come off from them all to Christ, the true and living way, and the free teacher.</Q> Some of the people were rude, but the greater part were civil; and told us, <Q>They had heard how we had been persecuted and abused in many places, but they would not do so to us there.</Q> I commended their moderation and sobriety, <Q>and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all sin and wickedness; testifying unto them, that Christ was now come to teach his people himself, by his Spirit and power.</Q></P>
<P>From hence we went to Beaumaris, a twon wherein John-ap-John had formerly been a preacher. After we had put up our horses at an inn, John went and spoke through the street; and there being a garrison in the town, they took him, and put him into prison. The inn-keeper's wife came, and told me, <Q>That the governor and magistrates were send∣ing for me, to commit me to prison also.' I told her, They had done more than they could answer already;
<PB N="322" REF="037441_0399_100D9082671D9490"/>and had acted contrary to christianity in imprisoning him for reproving sin in their streets and gates, and for declar∣ing the truth.</Q> Soon after came other friendly people, and told me, <Q>If I went into the street, they would imprison me also; therefore they desired me to keep within the inn.</Q> Upon this I was moved to go and walk up and down in the streets; and told the people, 'What an uncivil, unchristi∣an 'thing they had done, in casting my friend into prison. And they being high professors, I asked them, <Q>If this was the entertainment they had for strangers? And if they would willingly be so served themselves? And whether they, who looked upon the scriptures to be their rule, had any example in the scriptures, from Christ or his apostles, for what they had done?"</Q> So after awhile they set John-ap-John at liberty.</P>
<P>Next day, being market-day, we were to cross a great water; and not far from the place where we were to take boat, many of the market-people drew to us; amongst whom we had good service for the Lord, <Q>declaring the word of life and everlasting truth unto them, and proclaiming the day of the Lord amongst them, which was coming upon all wickedness; and directing them to the light of Christ, which he, the heavenly man, had enlightened them with∣al; by which they might see all their sins, and all their false ways, religions, worships and teachers: and by the same light might see Christ Jesus, who was come to save them, and lead them to God.</Q> After the truth had been declared to them in the power of God, and Christ the free teacher set over all the hireling teachers; I bid John-ap-John get his horse into the boat, which was then ready. But there being a company of wild gentlemen, as they cal∣led them, got into it, whom we found very rude, and far from gentleness; they, with others, kept his horse out of the boat. I rode to the boat's side, and spoke to them, shewing them, <Q>What an unmanly and unchristian carriage it was; and told them, they shewed an unworthy spirit, below christianity or humanity.</Q> As I spoke, I leaped my horse into the boat amongst them; thinking John's horse would have followed, when he had seen mine go in before him: but the water being pretty deep, John could not get his horse into the boat. Wherefore I leaped out again on horseback into the water, and staid with John on that side, till the boat returned. There we tarried from the eleventh hour of the forenoon to the second in the afternoon,
<PB N="323" REF="037441_0400_100D90845D4CCF08"/>before the boat came to fetch us; and then had forty-two miles to ride that evening; and by that time we had paid for our passage, we had but one groat left between us in money. We rode about sixteen miles, and then got a little hay for our horses. Setting forward again, we came in the night to a little ale-house, where we thought to have staid and baited. But finding we could have neither oats nor hay there, we travelled all night; and about the fifth hour in the morning got to a place within six miles of Wrexham; where that day we met with many friends, and had a glo∣rious meeting; the Lord's everlasting power and truth was over all: and a meeting is continued there to this day. Ve∣ry weary we were with travelling so hard up and down in Wales; and in many places we found it difficult to get meat either for our horses or ourselves.</P>
<P>The next day we passed from thence into Flintshire, sounding the day of the Lord through the towns: and came into Wrexham at night. Here many of Floyd's people came to us; but very rude, wild, and airy they were, and little sense of truth they had: yet some were convinced in that town. Next morning one called a lady sent for me, who kept a preacher in her house. I went to her house, but found both her and her preacher very light and airy; too light to receive the weighty things of God. In her lightness she came and asked me, 'If she should cut my hair? I was moved to reprove her, and bid her cut down the corrup∣tions in herself with the sword of the Spirit of God; so after I had admonished her to be more grave and sober, we pass∣ed away. Afterwards in her frothy mind she made her boast, that she, 'came behind me, and cut off the curl of my hair;' but she spoke falsely.</P>
<P>From Wrexham we came to West-chester; and it being the fair-time, we staid there awhile, and visited friends. For I had travelled through every county in Wales, preach∣ing the everlasting gospel of Christ: and a brave people there is now, who have received it, and sit under Christ's teaching. But before I left Wales, I wrote to the magis∣trates of Beaumaris concerning their imprisoning John-ap-John; letting them see their condition, the fruits of their christianity, and of their teachers. Afterwards I met with some of them near London; but oh! how ashamed they were of their action!</P>
<P>From West-chester we came to Liverpool, where was at that time a fair; and as I rode through the fair, there stood
<PB N="324" REF="037441_0401_100D9086B71E5618"/>a friend upon the cross, declaring the truth to the people; who seeing me ride by, and knowing I had appointed a meeting to be the next day upon an hill not far off, gave notice to the people, <Q>That George Fox, the servant of the Lord, would have a meeting next day upon such an hill; and if any feared the Lord, they might come and hear him declare the word of life to them.</Q> We went that night to Richard Cubban's, who himself was convinced, though not his wife; but at that time she was convinced also.</P>
<P>Next day we went to the meeting on the top of the hill, which was very large. Some rude people with a priest's wife came, and made a noise for awhile; but the Lord's power came over them, the meeting became quiet, and the truth of God was declared amongst them. Many were that day settled upon the rock and foundation Christ Jesus, and under his teaching; who made peace betwixt God and them.</P>
<P>We had a small meeting with a few friends and people at Malpoth. From thence we came to another place, where we had a meeting. There came a bailiff with a sword, and was rude; but the Lord's power came over him, and friends were established in the truth.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Manchester: and the sessions being there that day, many rude people were come out of the country. In the meeting they threw at me coals, clods, stones, and water: yet the Lord's power bore me up over them, that they could not strike me down. At last, when they saw they could not prevail by throwing water, stones, and dirt at me, they went and informed the justices in the sessions; who thereupon sent officers to fetch me before of life to the people, plucked me down, and haled me into their court. When I came there all the court was in a dis∣order and a noise. Wherefore I asked, <Q>Where were the magistrates, that they did not keep the people civil?</Q> Some of the justices said, They were magistrates. I asked them, <Q>Why then they did not appease the people, and keep them sober?</Q> For one cried, I'll swear, and another cried, I'll swear. I declared to the justices, <Q>How we were abused in our meeting by the rude people, who threw stones, clods, dirt, and water: and how I was haled out of the meeting and brought thither, contrary to the instrument of government,</Q> which said, <Q>None should be molested in
<PB N="325" REF="037441_0402_100D908949A72160"/>their meetings that professed God, and owned the Lord Jesus Christ;</Q> which I did.' The truth so came over them, that when one of the rude followers cried, <Q>He would swear;</Q> one of the justices checked him, saying, 'What, will you swear? hold your tongue.' At last they bid the constable, <Q>Have me to my lodging, and there I should be secured till to-morrow morning that they sent for me again.</Q> So the constable had me to my lodging. As we went the people were exceeding rude; but I let them see the <Q>fruits of their teachers, how they shamed christia∣nity, and dishonoured the name of Jesus which they pro∣fessed.</Q> At night we went to a justice's in the town, who was pretty moderate, and I had a great deal of discourse with him. Next morning we sent to the constable to know if he had any thing more to say to us? He sent us word, <Q>He had nothing to say to us, we might go whither we would.</Q> The Lord hath since raised up a people to stand for his name and truth in that town over those chaffy pro∣fessors.</P>
<P>We passed from Manchester, having many precious meetings in serveral places, till we came to Preston; be∣tween which and Lancaster I had a general meeting: from which I went to Lancaster. There at our inn I met with colonel West, who was very glad to see me; who meeting with judge Fell, told him, <Q>I was mightily grown in the tuth;</Q> when indeed he was come nearer to the truth, and so could better discern it.</P>
<P>We came from Lancaster to Robert Widders's. On the first-day after I had a general meeting near the Sands-side, of friends of Westmoreland and Lancashire, when the Lord's everlasting power was over all; in which the word of eternal life was declared, and friends were settled upon the foundation, Christ Jesus, under his free teaching; and many were convinced, and turned to the Lord.</P>
<P>Next day I came over the Sands to Swarthmore, where friends were glad to see me. I staid there two first-days, vi∣siting friends in their meetings there-away. They rejoiced with me in the goodness of the Lord, who by his eternal power had carried me through and over, many difficul∣ties and dangers in his service; to him be the praise for ever!</P>
<P>Having got a little respite from travel, I was moved to write an epistle to friends, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="326" REF="037441_0403_100D908ADB8A2008"/>
<P>ALL friends of the Lord every where, whose minds are turned in towards the Lord, take heed to the light within you, which is the light of Christ; which, as you love it, will call your minds inward, that are abroad in the creatures: so your minds may be renewed by it, and turned to God in this which is pure, to worship the living God, the Lord of hosts over all the creatures. That which calls your minds out of the lusts of the world, will call them out of the affections and desires, and turn you to set your affections above. The same that calls the mind out of the world, will give judgment upon the world's affections and lusts, that which calls out your minds from the world's teachers and the creatures, to have your minds renewed. There is your obedience known and found; there the image of God is renewed in you, and ye come to grow up in it. That which calls your minds out of the earth, turns them towards God, where the pure Babe is born of the virgin; and the Babe's food is known, the children's bread, which comes from the liv∣ing God, and nourishes up to eternal life: which babes and children receive their wisdom from above, from the pure living God, and not from the earthly one; for that is trodden under foot by such. All who hate this light, whose minds are abroad in the creatures, in the earth, and in the image of the devil, get the words of the saints (that received their wisdom from above) into the old nature and their corrupted minds. Such are murderers of the just, enemies to the cross of Christ, in whom the prince of the air lodgeth, sons of perdition, betrayers of the just. Therefore take heed to that light, which is oppressed with that nature; which light, as it arises, shall condemn all that cursed nature, shall turn it out, and shut it out of the house. So ye will come to see the candle lighted, and the house sweeping and swept. Then the pure pearl ariseth, then the eternal God is exalted. The same light that calls in your minds out of the world (that are abroad) the same turns them to God the father of lights. Here in the pure mind is the pure God waited upon for wisdom from above; the pure God is seen night and day, and the eternal peace, of which there is no end, enjoyed. People may have openings, and yet their minds go into the lusts of the flesh; but there the affections are not mortified. Therefore hearken to that, take heed to that, which calls your minds out of the affections and lusts of the world
<PB N="327" REF="037441_0404_100D908C6F2C1C60"/>to have them renewed. The same will turn your minds to God; the same light will set your affections above, and bring you to wait for the pure wisdom of God from on high, that it may be justified in you. Wait all in that which calls in your minds and turns them to God; here is the true cross. That mind shall feed upon nothing that is earthly, but be kept in the pure light up to God, to feed upon the living food which comes from the living God. The Lord God Almighty be with you all, dear babes, and keep you all in his strength and power to his glory, over all the world, ye whose minds are called out of it, and turned to God, to worship the Creator and serve him, and not the creature. The light of God which calls the mind out of the creatures, and turns it to himself, brings into a being of endless joy and peace. Here is always a seeing God present, which is not known to the world, whose hearts are in the creatures whose knowledge is in the flesh, whose minds are not renewed. Therefore all friends, the seed of God mind and dwell in, to reign over the unjust; and the power of the Lord dwell in, to keep you clear in your understandings, that the seed of God may reign in you all; the Seed of God, which is but one in all, is Christ in the male and in the female, which the promise is to. Wait upon the Lord for the just to reign over the unjust for the seed of God to reign over the seed of the serpent, and be the head; and that all that is mortal may die: for out of that will rise presumption. So fare ye well, and God Almighty bless, guide, and keep you in his wisdom.</P>

<P>About this time friends that were moved of the Lord to go to the steeple-houses and markets, to 'reprove sin, and 'warn people of the day of the Lord,' suffered much hard∣ship from rude people, and also from the magistrates; being commonly pulled down, buffeted, beaten, and frequently sent to prison. Wherefore I was moved to give forth the following expostulation to be spread amongst people, to shew them how contrary they acted therein to the apostles doctrine and practice, and to bring them to more modera∣tion.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>IS it not better for you that have cast into prison the ser∣vants and children of the Lord God for speaking, as they
<PB N="328" REF="037441_0405_100D908F049347A8"/>were moved, in steeple-houses or markets, Is it not better, I say, for you to <Q>try all things, and hold fast that which is good?</Q> Is it not of more honour and credit, to <Q>prove all things, and try all things, than to pluck down in the steeple-houses, pull off the hair of their heads. and cast them into prison?</Q> Is this an honour to your truth and gospel you profess? Doth it not shew that ye are out of the truth, and are not ready to instruct the gainsayers? Hath not the Lord said, <Q>He will pour out of his Spirit upon all flesh, and his sons and daughters shall prophesy, and old men shall dream dreams, and young men see visions, and on his handmaids he will pour forth of his Spirit?</Q> Was not this prophecy in ages past stood against by the wise, learned men in their own wisdom, and by the synagogue-teachers? Were not such haled out of the synagogues and temple, who witnessed the Spirit pour∣ed forth upon them? Doth not this shew, that ye have not received the pourings forth of this Spirit upon you, who fill the gaols with so many sons and daughters, and hold up such teachers as are bred up in learning at Oxford and Cambridge, and are made by the will of man? Doth not this shew, that ye who are bred up there, who are made teachers by the will of man, and who persecute for prophesying, are strangers to the Spirit that is <Q>poured forth upon sons and daughters;</Q> by which Spirit they come to "minister to the spirits that are in prison?" The Lord hath a controversy with you who are found prisoning and persecuting such as the Lord hath poured his Spirit upon. Do not your fruits shew, in all the na∣tion where ye come, in towns, cities, villages, and coun∣tries, that ye are the seedsmen made by the will of man, who sow to the flesh, of which nothing but corruption is reaped in nations, countries, cities, and villages? Ye are looked upon and your fruits, and that which may be gathered is seen by all that are in the light, as they pass through your countries, towns, cities, and villages, that ye are all the seedsmen that have sown to the flesh. Of this take ye notice, who are of that birth that is born of the flesh; ye sow to your own, persecuting him that is born of the Spirit, who sows to the Spirit, and of the Spirit reaps life eternal. Such ye, who sow to the flesh, cast into prison. Do ye not hale out of the synagogues? per∣secute and beat in the synagogues, and knock down? Are not these the works of the flesh? Have not many been
<PB N="329" REF="037441_0406_100D90917754E6D8"/>almost murdered and smothered in your synagogues? Have not some been haled out of your synagogues, for but looking at a priest, and after cast into prison? Doth not all this make manifest what spirit ye are of, and your fruits to be of the flesh? What pleasures and sports in every town are to be seen among your flocks, that sow to the flesh and are born of it! Whereas the ministers of the Spirit cried against such as "sported in the day-time," such as "ate and drank, and rose up to play," such as "lived wantonly upon earth in pleasures," such as lived in "fulness of bread and idleness," such as <Q>defile the flesh;</Q> such did God overthrow, destroy, and set forth as examples to all them that after should live ungodly. But are not the fruits of this reaped in every town? Can∣not ye from hence see, that here is sowing to the flesh? Again, what scorning, scoffing, mocking, derision, and strife. What oaths, drunkenness, uncleanness, and cursed speaking! What lust and pride is seen in the streets! These fruits we see are reaped of the flesh. So here we see the seedsman, him that sows to this flesh, of which nothing but corruption is reaped, as the countries, towns, cities, and villages make manifest. But the ministers of the Spirit, who sow to the Spirit, come to reap life eternal. These discern the other seedsman, who sows to the flesh, and of the flesh reaps corruption. For the day hath ma∣nifested each seedsman, and what is reaped from each is seen; glory be to the Lord God for ever! The ministers of the Spirit, born of the Spirit, sons and daughters which have the Spirit poured upon them, and witness the promise of God fulfilled in them, by the Spirit of God preach and minister to the spirit in prison in every one, in the sight of God, the Father of spirits. God's hand is turned against you all that have destroyed God's creatures upon your lust. God's hand is turned against you that have wronged by unjust dealing, defrauded, and oppres∣sed the poor, and have respected the persons of the proud, and lend not your ear to the cry of the poor. The Lord's hand and arm against you all is turned. and his righteous judgment and justice upon you all will be accomplished and repaid, who shall have a reward, every one accord∣ing to his works. Oh! the abomination and hypocritical profession that is upon the earth, where God and Christ, faith, hope, the holy Spirit, and truth is professed, but the fear of God, and the faith that purifies and gives vic∣tory
<PB N="330" REF="037441_0407_100D90930CF97110"/>over the world, not lived in! Doth it not appear that the wisdom which rules in all those, whom the seeds∣man that sows to the flesh sows for, and who are born of the flesh, are from below, earthly, sensual, and devilish, their understanding brutish, and their knowledge natural as the brute beasts? For men and women in that state have not patience to speak one to the other of the scrip∣tures, without much corruption and flesh appearing, yet they have a feigned humility, a will-worship, and righ∣teousness of self; but they own not the light, which <Q>lighteth every man that cometh into the world, Christ Jesus, the righteousness of God:</Q> which light being own∣ed, self, and the righteousness of self, comes to be denied. Here is the humility that is contrary to the light, and that is below and feigned. Here is the wisdom that is from be∣low, earthly, sensual, and devilish: for people can scarce dif∣fer from one another without destroying one another, pri∣soning and persecuting one another, when they speak of the scriptures. This is the devilish wisdom murdering and destroying. This is not the wisdom that is from above, which is pure and peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreat∣ed, full of mercy and good fruits. Here all may read each seedsman, which hath each wisdom. He that sows to the flesh, and is born of that, hath the wisdom that is earthly, sensual, and devilish; he that sows to the Spirit, a minister of the Spirit, hath the wisdom from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated; the wisdom by which all things were made and created. Now is each wis∣dom discovered, and each seedsman: the day, which is the light, hath discovered them.</P>

<P>I was moved also to give forth the following epistle to friends, to stir them up to be bold and valiant for the truth, and to encourage them in their sufferings for it.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends and brethren every where, now is the day of your trial, now is the time for you to be valiant, and to see that the testimony of the Lord doth not fall. Now is the day for the exercise of your gifts, of your patience, and of your faith. Now is the time to be armed with patience, with the light, with righteousness, and with the helmet of salvation. Now is the trial of the slothful servant who hides his talent and will judge Christ hard.
<PB N="331" REF="037441_0408_100D90952F81CDE0"/>Now, happy are they that can say, <Q>The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, and he gives the increase;</Q> therefore who takes it from you? Is it not the Lord still that suffers it? For the Lord can try you as he did Job, whom he made rich, whom he made poor, and whom he made rich again; who still kept his integrity in all condi∣tions. Learn Paul's lesson, In all states to be content; and have his faith, <Q>That nothing is able to separate us from the love of God, which we have in Christ Jesus.</Q> Therefore be rich in life, and in grace, which will endure, ye who are heirs of life, and born of the womb of eternity, that noble birth that cannot stoop to that which is born in sin, and conceived in iniquity; who are better bred and born, whose religion is from God, above all the religions that are from below; and who walk by faith, by that which God hath given you, and not by that which men make, who walk by sight, from the Mass-book to the Di∣rectory. Such are subject to stumble and fall, who walk by sight and not by faith. Therefore mind him that de∣stroys the original of sin, the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of Satan, viz. sin; who would have by entail an inheritance of sin in men and women from gene∣ration to generation, and pleads for it by all his lawyers and counsellors. For though the law, which made no∣thing perfect, did not cut it off; yet Christ being come destroys the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of sin. This angers all the devil's lawyers and counsel∣lors, that Satan shall not hold sin by entail in thy garden, in thy field, in thy temple, thy tabernacle. So keep your tabernacles, that there ye may see the glory of the Lord appear at the doors thereof. Be faithful; for ye see what the worthies and valiants of the Lord did attain unto by faith. Enoch by faith was translated. Noah by faith was preserved over the waters in his ark. Abraham by faith forsook his father's house and religion, and all the religions of the world. Isaac and Jacob by faith followed his steps. See how Samuel and other of the Lord's prophets, with David, by faith were preserved to God over his enemies! Daniel and the three children by faith escaped the lions and the fire, and preserved their worship clean, and by it were kept over the worships of the world. The apostles by faith travelled up and down the world, were preserved from all the religions of the world, and beld forth the pure religion to the dark world, which they had received
<PB N="332" REF="037441_0409_100D9097D6ED2018"/>from God; and likewise their fellowship was received from above, which is in the gospel that is everlasting. In this, neither powers, principalities nor thrones, dominions nor angels, things present nor things to come, heights nor depths, nor death, mockings, nor spoiling of goods, prisons nor fetters were able to separate them from the love of God, which they had in Christ Jesus. And friends, "Quench not the Spirit, nor despise prophesying," where it moves; neither hinder babes and sucklings from cry∣ing Hosannah; for out of their mouths will God ordain strength. There were some in Christ's day that were against such, whom he reproved; and there were some in Mose's day, who would have stopped the prophets in the camp; whom Moses reproved, and said by way of en∣couragement to them, <Q>Would God, that all the Lord's people were prophets!</Q> So I say now to you. There∣fore ye that stop it in yourselves do not quench it in others, neither in babe nor suckling; for the Lord hears the cries of the needy, and the sighs and groans of the poor. Judge not that, nor the sighs and groans of the Spirit, which cannot be uttered, lest ye judge prayer; for prayer as well lies in sighs and groans to the Lord as otherwise. Let not the sons and daughters, nor the handmaids be stopped in their prophesyings, nor the young men in their visions, nor the old men in their dreams; but let the Lord be glorified in and through all, who is over all, God blessed for ever! So every one may improve their talents, every one exercise their gifts, and every one speak as the Spirit gives them utterance. Thus every one may minister, as he hath received the grace, as a good steward to him that hath given it him; so all plants may bud, and "bring forth fruit" to the glory of God: <Q>for the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal.</Q> See that every one hath profited in hea∣venly things; male and female, look into your own vine∣yards, see what fruit ye bear to God; look into your own houses, see how they are decked and trimmed; see what odors, myrrh, and frankincense ye have therein, and what a smell and savour ye have to ascend to God that he may be glorified. Bring your deeds all to the light, which ye are taught to believe in by Christ, your head, the heaven∣ly man: and see how they are wrought in God. Every male and female, let Christ dwell in your hearts by faith (Christ in the male and in the female;) and let your
<PB N="333" REF="037441_0410_100D9099DE665170"/>mouths be opened to the glory of God the Father, that he may rule and reign in you. We must not have Christ Jesus, the Lord of Life, put any more in a stable amongst the horses and asses; he must now have the best chamber, the heart; and the rude, debauched spirit must be turned out. Therefore let him reign whose right it is, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost; by which Holy Ghost ye call him Lord in which Holy Ghost ye pray, and have comfort and fellowship with the Father and with the Son. Therefore know the triumph in it, and in God and his power (which the devil is out of) and in the seed which is First and Last, the Beginning and Ending, the Top and Corner-stone: in which is my love to you, and in which I rest—</P>

<P>After I had tarried two first-days at Swarthmore, and visited meetings thereabouts, I passed into Westmoreland in the same work, till I came to John Audland's, where was a general meeting. The night before I had a vision of a <Q>desperate creature that was coming to destroy me, but I got victory over it.</Q> The next day in the meeting-time came one Otway, with some rude fellows. He rode round about the meeting with his sword or rapier, and would fain have got in through the friends to me; but the meeting being great, the friends stood thick, so that he could not easily come at me. When he had rid about several times raging, and found he could not get in, being also limited by the Lord's power, he at length went away. It was a glorious meeting, ended peaceably, and the Lord's ever∣lasting power came over all. This wild man went home, became distracted, and not long after died. I sent a paper to John Blaykling to read to him while he lay ill, shewing him his wickedness; and he did acknowledge something of it.</P>
<P>From hence I went through Kendal, where a warrant had long lain to apprehend me; and the constables seeing
<PB N="334" REF="037441_0411_100D909B6DC32DF0"/>me ran to fetch their warrant as I was riding through the town; but before they could come up with it I was past, and so escaped their hands.</P>
<P>I travelled northwards, visiting meetings, till I came to Strickland-head, where I had a great meeting. Most of the gentry of that country being gathered to an horse-race, not far from the meeting, I was moved to go and declare the truth to them; and a chief-constable did also admonish them. Our meeting was quiet, the Lord was with us; and by his word and power friends were settled in the eternal truth.</P>
<P>From hence we passed into Cumberland, where we had many precious, living meetings. After we had travelled to Gilsland, and had a meeting there, we came to Carlisle, where they used to put friends out of the town; but there came a great flood while we were there, that they could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put us out of the town; so we had a meeting there on the first-day. After which we passed to Abbey-holm, and had a little meeting there. This is a place where I told friends long before there would be a great people come forth to the Lord; which hath since come to pass, and a large meeting there is gathered to the Lord in those parts.</P>
<P>I passed from hence to a general meeting at Langlands in Cumberland, which was very large; for most of the people had so forsaken the priests, that the steeple-houses in some places stood empty. And John Wilkinson, a preacher, that I have often named before, who had three steeple-houses, had so few hearers left, that, giving over preaching in the steeple-houses, he first set up a meeting in his house, and preached there to them that were left. Afterwards he set up a silent meeting (like friends) to which came a few: for most of his hearers were come to friends. Thus he held on, till he had not past half a dozen left; the rest still forsaking him, and coming away to friends. At last, when he had so very few left, he would come to Pardsey-Crag (where friends had a meeting of several hundreds of people, who were all come to sit under the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching) and he would walk about the meeting on the first-days, like a man that went about the commons to look for sheep. During this time, I came to Pardsey-Crag meeting, and he with three or four of his followers, yet left him, came to the meeting that day; and were all thoroughly convinced. After the meeting. Wilkinson asked me two or three questi∣ons, which I answered to his satisfaction; from that time he came amongst friends, became an able minister, preached the
<PB N="335" REF="037441_0412_100D909D058010D8"/>gospel freely, and turned many to Christ's free teaching. And after he had continued many years in the free ministry of Christ Jesus, he died in the year 1675.</P>
<P>I had for some time felt drawings on my spirit to go into Scotland: and had sent to colonel William Osborn of Scotland, desiring him to meet me; and he, with some others, were come out of Scotland to this meeting. After it was over (which, he said, was the most glorious meeting that ever he saw in his life) I passed with him and his com∣pany into Scotland; having Robert Widders with me; a thundering man against hypocrisy, deceit, and the rotten∣ness of the priests.</P>
<P>The first night we came into Scotland, we lodged at an inn. The inn-keeper told us, an earl lived about a quar∣ter of a mile off, who had a desire to see me; and had left word at his house, that if ever I came into Scotland, he should send him word. He told us, there were three draw-bridges to his house; and that it would be nine o'clock before the third bridge was drawn. Finding we had time in the evening, we walked to his house. He re∣ceived us very lovingly; and said, He would have gone with us on our journey, but that he was before engaged to go to a funeral. After we had spent some time with him we parted very friendly, and returned to our inn. Next morning we travelled on, and passing through Dumfries, came to Douglas, where we met with some friends; from thence we passed to the Heads, where we had a blessed meeting in the name of Jesus, and felt him in the midst.</P>
<P>Leaving Heads, we went to Badcow, and had a meeting there: to which abundance of people came, and many were convinced: amongst whom was one called a lady. From thence we passed towards the Highlands to William Os∣born's, where we gathered up the sufferings of friends, and the principles of the Scotch priests, which may be seen in a book called, "The Scotch Priests Principles."</P>
<P>Afterwards we returned to Heads, Badcow, and Gar∣shore, where the said lady Margaret Hambleton was con∣vinced; who afterwards went to warn O. Cromwel and Charles Fleetwood of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</P>
<P>On first-day we had a great meeting, and several profes∣sors came to it. Now the priests had frighted the people with the doctrine of election and reprobation: telling them, <Q>That God had ordained the greatest part of men and wo∣men
<PB N="336" REF="037441_0413_100D909F95195E00"/>for hell; that, let them pray, or preach, or sing, and do what they could, it was all to no purpose, if they were ordained for hell; that God had a certain number, which were elected for heaven; and let them do what they would, as David an adulterer, and Paul a persecutor, yet elected vessels for heaven. So the fault was not at all in the crea∣ture, less or more; but God had ordained it so.' I was led to open to the people the falseness and folly of their priests doctrines, and shewed them, the priests had abus∣ed those scriptures which they had brought and quoted to them, as in Jude, and other places. For whereas they said, "There was no fault at all in the creature;" I shew∣ed them, that they, whom Jude speaks of, to wit, Cain, Core, and Balaam, who, he says, were ordained of old to condemnation, the fault was in them. For did not God warn Cain and Balaam, and put the question to Cain, "If thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted?" And did not the Lord bring Core out of Egypt, and his company? yet did not he gainsay both God and his law, and his prophet Moses? Here people might see that there was a fault in Cain, Corah, and Balaam; and so there is in all that go in their ways. For if they, who are called chris∣tians, resist the gospel as Core did the law, err from the Spirit of God as Balaam did, and do evil as Cain did, is not here a fault? which fault is in themselves, and is the cause of their reprobation, and not God. Doth not Christ say, "Go, preach the gospel to all nations?" Which is the gospel of salvation. He would not have sent them into all nations, to preach the doctrine of salvation, if the greatest part of men had been ordained for hell. Was not Christ a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, for those that became reprobates, as well as for the saints? He died for all men, the ungodly as well as the godly, as the apostle bears witness, 2 Cor. v. 15. Rom. v. vi. And "he enlightens every man that cometh into the world," that through him they might all believe. And Christ bids them believe in the light: but all they that hate the light, which Christ bids all believe in, are reprobated. Again, <Q>The manifestation of the Spirit of God is given to every man to profit withal;</Q> but they that vex, quench, and <Q>grieve it, are in the reprobation; and the fault is in them, as it is also in them that hate his light: The apostle saith, The grace of God, which brings salvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and
<PB N="337" REF="037441_0414_100D90A221361EF8"/>worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,</Q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now all those that live ungodly, and in the lusts of the world, that turn from this grace of God into wantonness, and walk despitefully against it, and so deny God, and the Lord Jesus Christ that bought them, the fault is in all such that turn from the grace of God into wantonness, and walk despitefully against that which would bring their salvation, and save them out of the reprobation. But the priests, it seems, can see no fault in such as deny God, and the Lord Jesus Christ that bought them, such as deny his light, which they should believe in, and his grace, which should teach them to live godly, and which should bring them their salvation. Now all that believe in the light of Christ, as he commands, are in the election; and sit un∣der the teaching of the grace of God, which brings their salvation. But such as turn from this grace into wanton∣ness are in the reprobation: and such as hate the light are in the condemnation. Therefore I exhorted all to believe in the light, as Christ commands, and own the grace of God their free teacher; and it would assuredly bring them their salvation: for it is sufficient.</Q> Many other scriptures were opened concerning reprobation, and the eyes of the people were opened; and a spring of life rose up among them.</P>
<P>These things soon came to the priests ear; for the peo∣ple, that sat under their dark teachings, began to see light, and to come into the convenant of light. The noise was spread over Scotland, among the priests, that I was come thither; and a great cry was amongst them, that all would be spoiled; for they said, <Q>I had spoiled all the honest men and women in England already</Q> (so according to their own account, the worst were left to them.) Upon this they gather∣ed great assemblies of priests together, and drew up a num∣ber of curses to be read in their several steeple-houses, that all the people should say Amen to. Some few I will here set down; the reft may be read in the book before-mention∣ed of "The Scotch Priests Principles."</P>
<P>The first was, <Q>Cursed is he that saith, Every man hath a light within him sufficient to lead him to salvation: and let all the people say, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>The second, <Q>Cursed is he that saith, Faith is without sin: and let all the people say, Amen.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="037441_0415_100D90A3B3200EF8"/>
The third, <Q>Cursed is he that denieth the sabbath-day: and let all the people say, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>In this last they make the people curse themselves; for on the sabbath-day (which is the seventh day of the week, which the Jews kept by the command of God to them) they kept markets and fairs, and so brought the curse upon their own heads.</P>
<P>As to the first, concerning the light, Christ saith, <Q>Be∣lieve in the light, that ye may become children of the light:</Q> and, <Q>he that believeth shall be saved: he that be∣lieveth shall have everlasting life: he that believeth passes from death to life, and is grafted into Christ.</Q> <Q>And ye do well,</Q> saith the apostle, <Q>that ye take heed unto the light that shines in the dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts.</Q> So the light is suf∣ficient to lead unto the day-star.</P>
<P>As concerning faith, it is the gift of God: and every gift of God is pure. The faith, which Christ is the author of, is precious, divine, and without sin. This is the faith which gives victory over sin, and access to God; in which faith they please God. But those are reprobates themselves con∣cerning this faith, and are in their dead faith, who charge sin upon this faith under pain of a curse: which faith gives victory over their curse, and returns it into their own bowels.</P>
<P>There were a company of Scots near Badcow, who chal∣lenged a dispute with some of our Scotch friends (for with me they would not dispute:) so some of the Scotch friends met them at the market-place. The dispute was to be concerning the sabbath-day, and some other of their princi∣ples before-mentioned; and I having got their principles and assertions, shewed the friends where they might easily be overthrown; and a Scotch friend, a smith, overthrew them clearly.</P>
<P>There were two Independent churches in Scotland, in one of which many were convinced; but the pastor of the other was in a great rage against truth and friends. They had their elders, who sometimes would exercise their gifts amongst the church members, and were sometimes pretty tender: but their pastor speaking so much against the light, and us, the friends of Christ, he darkened his hearers; so that they grew blind and dry, and lost their tenderness. He continued preaching against friends, and against the light of Christ Jesus, calling it natural; at last one day in his
<PB N="339" REF="037441_0416_100D90A56AD6BC60"/>preaching he cursed the light, and fell down as dead in his pulpit. The people carried him out, laid him upon a grave-stone, and poured strong waters into him, which fetched him to life again; and they carried him home, but he was mopish. After awhile he stripped off his cloaths, put on a Scotch plaid, and went into the country amongst the dairy-women. When he had staid there about two weeks he came home, and went into the pulpit again. Whereupon the people expected some great manifestation or revelation from him; but, instead thereof, he began to tell them what entertainment he had met with; how one woman gave him skimmed milk, another buttermilk, and another good milk: so the people were obliged to take him out of the pulpit again, and carry him home. He that gave me this account, was Andrew Robinson, one of his chief hearers, who came afterwards to be convinced, and re∣ceived the truth. He said, he never heard that he reco∣vered his senses again. By this people may see what came upon him that cursed the light, which light is the life in Christ, the word; and it may be a warning to all others that speak evil against the light of Christ.</P>
<P>Now were the priests in such a rage, that they posted to Edinburgh, to O. Cromwel's council there, with petitions against me. The noise was, 'That all was gone;' for se∣veral friends were come out of England, and spread over Scotland, sounding the day of the Lord, preaching the ever∣lasting gospel of salvation, and turning people to Christ Jesus, who died for them, that they might receive his free teaching. After I had gathered the principles of the Scotch priests, and the sufferings of friends, and had seen friends in that part of Scotland settled, by the Lord's power, upon Christ their foundation, I went to Edinburgh, and in the way came to Linlithgow; where lodging at an inn, the inn∣keeper's wife, who was blind, received the word of life, and came under the teaching of Christ Jesus her Saviour. At night came in abundance of soldiers, and some officers, with whom we had much discourse; some were rude. One of the officers said, <Q>He would obey the Turk's or Pilate's command, if they should command him to guard Christ to crucify him.</Q> So far he was from all tenderness, or sense of the Spirit of Christ, that he would rather crucify the Just, than suffer for or with the Just; whereas many officers and magistrates have lost their places, before they would turn against the Lord and his Just One.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="037441_0417_100D90A80A4011B8"/>
When I had staid awhile at Edinburgh, I went to Leith, where many officers of the army came in with their wives; and many were convinced. Edward Billing's wife was one. She brought a great deal of coral in her hand, and threw it on the table before me, to see whether I would speak against it, or no, I took no notice of it, but declared the truth to her, and she was reached. Many Baptists were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, so that they went away confounded. Then there came in another sort; one of whom said, <Q>He would dispute with me; and, for argument's sake, would deny there was a God.</Q> I told him, <Q>He might be one of those fools that said in his heart, There is no God; but he should know him in the day of his judgment.</Q> So he went his way, and a fine precious time we had afterwards with several people of account; and the Lord's power came over all. William Osborn was with me. Colonel Lidcot's wife, William Welsh's wife, and se∣veral of the officers themselves were convinced. Edward Billing and his wife at that time lived apart; and she being reached by truth, and become loving to friends, we sent for her husband, who came, and the Lord's power reached to them both; they joined together in it, and agreed to live together in love and unity, as man and wife.</P>
<P>After this we returned to Edinburgh, where many thou∣sands were gathered together, with abundance of priests among them, about burning a witch; and I was moved to declare the day of the Lord amongst them; which when I had done, I went from thence to our meeting, whither ma∣ny rude people and Baptists came. The Baptists began to vaunt with their logick and syllogisms; but. <Q>I was moved in the Lord's power, to thresh their chaffy light minds; and shewed the people, that, after that fallacious way of discoursing, they might make white seem black, and black seem white: as, that because a cock had two legs, and each of them had two legs; therefore they were all cocks. Thus they might turn any thing into lightness and vanity; but it was not the way of Christ, or his apostles, to teach, speak, or reason after that manner.</Q> Hereupon those Bap∣tists went their way; and after they were gone, we had a blessed meeting in the Lord's power, which was over all.</P>
<P>I mentioned before, that many of the Scotch priests being greatly disturbed at the spreading of truth, and the loss of their hearers thereby, were gone to Edinburgh to petition the council against me. When I came from the meeting to
<PB N="341" REF="037441_0418_100D90A9F1936800"/>the inn where I lodged, an officer belonging to the council brought me the following order:</P>
<Q><P>Thursday, the 8th of October, 1657, at his Highness's Council in Scotland:</P>
<P>Ordered,</P>
<P>THAT George Fox do appear before the Council on Tuesday the 13th of October next, in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>E. Downing, Clerk of the Council.</P></Q>
<P>When he had delivered me the order, he asked me, 'Whether I would appear or no?' I did not tell him whe∣ther I would or no; but asked him, <Q>If he had not forged the order?</Q> He said, <Q>No; it was a real order from the council, and he was sent as their messenger with it.</Q> When the time came I appeared, and was had into a great room, where many persons came and looked at me. After awhile the door-keeper had me into the council-chamber: and as I was going, he took off my hat. I asked him, <Q>Why he did so? and who was there, that I might not go in with my hat on? I told him, I had been before the Protector with my hat on.</Q> But he hung up my hat and had me in before them. When I had stood awhile, and they said nothing to me, I was moved of the Lord to say, <Q>Peace be amongst you. Wait in the fear of God, that ye may receive his wisdom from above, by which all things were made and created; that by it ye may all be ordered, and may order all things under your hands to God's glo∣ry.</Q> They asked me, <Q>What was the occasion of my com∣ing into that nation?</Q> I told them I came to visit the <Q>seed of God, which had long lain in bondage under cor∣ruption; that all in the nation, who professed the scrip∣tures, the words of Christ, of the prophets and apostles, might come to the light, Spirit, and power, which they were in who gave them forth; that in and by the Spirit they might understand the scriptures, and know Christ and God aright, have fellowship with them, and one with another.</Q> They asked me, <Q>Whether I had any outward business there?</Q> I said, 'Nay.' Then they asked me. 'How long I intended to stay in that country?' I told them, <Q>I should say little to that; my time was not to be long; yet in my freedom in the Lord I stood, in the will of him that sent me.</Q> Then they bid me withdraw; and 'the door-keeper took me by the hand, and led me forth.
<PB N="342" REF="037441_0419_100D90AB8725A6A0"/>In a little time they sent for me again, and told me, <Q>I must depart the nation of Scotland by that day sevennight.</Q> I asked them. <Q>Why? What had I done? What was my transgression, that they passed such a sentence upon me to depart out of the nation?</Q> They told me, <Q>They would not dispute with me.</Q> <Q>I desired them to hear what I had to say to them.</Q> They said, <Q>They would not hear me.</Q> I told them, <Q>Pharaoh heard Moses and Aaron, yet he was an heathen; and Herod heard John Bap∣tist; and they should not be worse than these.</Q> But they cried, 'Withdraw, withdraw.' Whereupon the door-keeper took me again by the hand and led me out. I returned to my inn, and continued still in Edinburgh; visiting friends there and thereabouts, and strengthening them in the Lord. After a little time I wrote a letter to the council, to lay be∣fore them their unchristian dealings, in banishing me, an innocent man that sought their salvation and eternal good.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the council of Edinburgh:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that sit in council, and bring before your judg∣ment-seat the innocent, the just, without shewing what evil I have done, or convicting me of any breach of law; and afterwards ye banish me out of your nation, without telling me for what; though I told you, when ye asked me How long I would stay in the nation?' that my time was not long (I spoke it innocently;) yet ye banish me. Will not all, think ye, that fear God, judge this to be wickedness? Consider, did not they sit in council about Stephen, when they stoned him to death? Did they not sit in council about Peter and John, when they haled them out of the temple, put them out of their council for a little season, and took counsel together; and then brought them in again, threatened, and charged them to speak no more in that name? Was not this to stop the truth from spreading in that time? Had not the priests an hand in these things, with the magistrates? and in ex∣amining Stephen, when he was stoned to death? Was not the council gathered together against Jesus Christ, to put him to death? and had not the chief priests an hand in it? When they persecute the just, and crucify the just, do they not then neglect judgment, mercy, and justice, and the weighty matters of the law, which are just? Was not the apostle Paul tossed up and down and impri∣soned
<PB N="343" REF="037441_0420_100D90AD18DFDBE0"/>by the priests and the rulers? Was not John Bap∣tist cast into prison? Are not ye doing the same work, shewing what spirit ye are of? Now, do not ye shew the end of your profession, the end of your prayers, the end of your religion, and the end of your teaching, who are now come to banish the truth, and him that came to declare it unto you? Doth not this shew that ye are but in the words, out of the life of the prophets, Christ, and his apostles? for they did not use such practice, as to banish any. How do ye receive strangers, which is a command of God among the prophets, Christ, and the apostles? Some by that means have entertained angels at unawares; but ye banish one that comes to visit the seed of God, and is not chargeable to any of you. Will not all that fear God look upon this to be spite and wickedness against the truth? How are ye like to love enemies, that banish your friend? How are ye like to do good to them that hate you, when ye do evil to them that love you? How are ye like to heap coals of fire on their heads that hate you. and to overcome evil with good, when ye banish thus? Do ye not manifest to all that are in the truth that ye have not the christian spirit? How did ye do justice to me, when ye could not convict me of any evil, yet banish me? This shews that truth is banished out of your hearts, and ye have taken part against the truth with evil-doers, with the wicked envious priests, stoners, strikers, and mockers in the streets; with these, ye that banish have taken part; whereas ye should have been a terror to these, and a praise to them that do well, and succourers of them that are in the truth; then might ye have been a blessing to the na∣tion, and not have banished him that was moved of the Lord to visit the seed of God, and thereby have brought your names upon record, and made them stink in ages to come, among them that fear God. Were not the magis∣trates stirred up in former ages to persecute or banish, by the corrupt priests? and did not the corrupt priests stir up the rude multitude against the just in other ages? There∣fore are your streets like Sodom and Gomorrah. Did not the Jews and the priests make the Gentiles minds en∣vious against the apostles? Who were they that would not have the prophet Amos to prophesy at the king's chapel; but bad him fly his way? When Jeremiah was put in the prison, in the dungeon, and in the stocks, had not the priests an hand with the princes in doing it? Now
<PB N="344" REF="037441_0421_100D90AF728F0610"/>see all, that were in this work of banishing, prisoning, persecuting, whether they were not all out of the life of Christ, the prophets, and apostles? To the witness of God in you all I speak. Consider, Whether or no they were not always the blind magistrates, which turned their sword always backward, that knew not their friends from their foes, and so hit their friends? Such magistrates were deceived by flattery.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When this was delivered, and read amongst them, some of them, I heard, were troubled at what they had done; being made sensible that they would not be so served them∣selves. But it was not long before they that banished me were banished themselves, or glad to get away; who would not do good in the day when they had power, nor suffer others that would.</P>
<P>After I had spent some time among friends at Edinburgh, and thereabouts, I passed from thence to Heads again, where friends had been in great sufferings; for the Presbyterian priests had excommunicated them, and given charge, that none should buy or sell with them, nor eat nor drink with them. So they could neither sell their commodities, nor buy what they wanted; which made it go very hard with some of them; for if they had bought bread or other vic∣tuals of any of their neighbours, the priests threatened them so with curses, that they would run and fetch it from them again. But colonel Ashfield, being a justice of peace in that country, put a stop to the priests proceedings. This colonel Ashfield was afterwards convinced himself, had a meeting settled at his house, and declared the truth, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>After I had visited friends at and about Heads, and en∣couraged them in the Lord, I went to Glasgow, where a meeting was appointed; but not one of the town came to it. As I went into the city, the guard at the gates took me before the governor, who was a moderate man. A great deal of discourse I had with him; but he was too light to receive the truth; yet he set me at liberty: so I passed to the meeting. But seeing none of the town's people came to the meeting, we declared truth through the town; then passed away, visited friends meetings thereabouts, and re∣turned towards Badcow. Several friends declared truth in their steeple-houses, and the Lord's power was with them.
<PB N="345" REF="037441_0422_100D90B1B99E9088"/>One time, as I was going with William Osborn to his house, there lay a company of rude fellows by the way-side, who had hid themselves under the hedges and in bushes. I espying them, asked him, 'What they were?' 'Oh!' said he, 'they are thieves.' Robert Widders, being moved to go to speak to a priest, was left behind, intending to come af∣ter; so I said to William Osborn, <Q>I will stay here in this valley, and do thou go look after Robert Widders.</Q> But he was unwilling to go, being afraid to leave me there alone because of those fellows; till I told him, <Q>I feared them not.</Q> Then I called to them, asking them, What they lay lurking there for? I bid them come up to me; but they were loth to come. I charged them to come up to me, or else it might be worse with them. Then they came trem∣bling to me; for the dread of the Lord had struck them. I admonished them to be honest, and directed them to the light of Christ in their hearts, that by it they might see what an evil it was to follow after theft and robbery; and the power of the Lord came over them. I staid there till William Osborn and Robert Widders came, and then we passed on together. But it is likely, if we two had gone before, they would have robbed Widders when he had come after alone, there being three or four of them.</P>
<P>We went to William Osborn's, where we had a good opportunity to declare the truth to several people that came in. Then we went among the Highlanders, who were so devilish they had like to have spoiled us and our horses; for they ran at us with pitchforks; but through the Lord's goodness we escaped them, being preserved by his power.</P>
<P>From thence we passed to Stirling, where the soldiers took us up, and had us to the main-guard. After a few words with their officers, the Lord's power coming over them, we were set at liberty; but no meeting could we get amongst them in the town, they were so closed up in dark∣ness. Next morning there came a man with an horse that was to run a race, and most of the town's people and the officers went to see it. As they returned from the race, I had a brave opportunity to declare the day of the Lord and his word of life amongst them. Some confessed to it, and some opposed; but the Lord's truth and power came over them all.</P>
<P>Leaving Stirling we came to Burnt-Island, where I had two meetings at Captain Pool's; one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Whilst they went to dinner I walk∣ed
<PB N="346" REF="037441_0423_100D90B34E61EA50"/>to the sea-side, not having freedom to eat with them. Both he and his wife were convinced, and became good friends afterward; and several officers of the army came in and received the truth.</P>
<P>We passed from thence through several other places in that country, till we came to Johnstons; where were se∣veral Baptists, that were very bitter, and came in a rage to dispute with us. Vain janglers and disputers indeed they were. When they could not prevail by disputing, they went and informed the governor against us, and next morn∣ing they raised a whole company of foot, and banished me, Alexander Parker, James Lancaster, and Robert Widders out of the town. As they guarded us through the town, James Lancaster was moved to sing with a melodious sound in the power of God, and I was moved to proclaim the day of the Lord, and preach the everlasting gospel to the peo∣ple. For the people generally came forth, so that the sitreets were filled with them; and the soldiers were so ashamed, that they said, <Q>They had rather have gone to Jamaica than have guarded us so.</Q> But we were put into a boat with our horses, carried over the water, and there left. The Baptists, who were the cause of our being thus put out of this town, were themselves, not long after, turned out of the army: and he that was then governor was dis∣carded also when the king came in.</P>
<P>Being thus thrust out of Johnstons we went to another market-town, where Edward Billing and many soldiers quartered. We went to an inn, and desired to have a meet∣ing in the town, that we might preach the everlasting gospel amongst them. The officers and soldiers said, <Q>We should have it in the town-hall;</Q> but the Scotch magistrates in spite appointed a meeting there that day for the business of the town. Which when the officers of the soldiery under∣stood, and perceived that it was done in malice, they would have had us to have gone into the twon-hall nevertheless. But we told them, 'No, by no means;' for then the magis∣trates might inform the governor against them, and say, <Q>They took the town-hall from them by force, when they were to do their town-business therein.</Q> We told them. 'We would go to the market-place.' They said. <Q>It was market-day.</Q> We replied, <Q>It was so much the better; for we would have all people to hear the truth and know our principles.</Q> Alexander Parker went and stood upon the market-cross, with a bible in his hand, and declared the
<PB N="347" REF="037441_0424_100D90B5368A9DB0"/>truth amongst the soldiers and market-people: but the Scots, being a dark, carnal people, gave little heed, nor hardly took notice what was said. After awhile I was mo∣ved of the Lord to stand up at the cross, and to declare with a loud voice the everlasting truth, and the day of the Lord that was coming upon all sin and wickedness. Where-upon the people came running out of the town-hall, and gathered so together that at last we had a large meeting; for they only sate in the court for a colour to hinder us from having the hall to meet in. When the people were come away, the magistrates followed them. Some walked by, but some staid and heard; and the Lord's power came over all and kept all quiet. <Q>The people were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, who died for them, and had en∣lightened them, that with his light they might see their evil deeds, be saved from their sins by him, and might come to know him to be their teacher. But if they would not receive Christ, and own him, it was told them, that this light which came from him would be their condemna∣tion</Q></P>
<P>Several of them were made loving to us, especially the English, and some came afterwards to be convinced. But there was a soldier that was very envious against us; he hat∣ed both us and the truth, spoke evil of the truth, and very despuefully against the light of Christ Jesus, which we bore testimony to. Mighty zealous he was for the priests and their hearers. As this man was holding his hat before his sace, while the priest prayed; one of the priest's hearers stabbed him to death. So he, who had rejected the teach∣ings of the Lord Jesus Christ, and cried down the servants of the Lord, was murdered amongst them whom he had so cried up, and by one of them.</P>
<P>We travelled from this town to Leith, warning and ex∣horting people as we went, to turn to the Lord. At Leith the innkeeper told me, the council had granted warrants to apprehend me, <Q>because I was not gone out of the nation after the seven days were expired that they had ordered me to depart the nation in</Q> Several friendly people also came and told me the same. To whom I said; <Q>What do ye tell me of their warrants against me? If there were a cart load of them I do not regard them; for the Lord's power is over them all.</Q></P>
<P>I went from Leith to Edinburgh again, where they said the warrants from the council were out against me. I went
<PB N="348" REF="037441_0425_100D90B7862E0800"/>to the inn where I had lodged before, and no man offered to meddle with me. After I had visited friends in the city, I desired those that travelled with me to get ready their horses in the morning; and we rode out of town together. There were with the me Thomas Rawlinson, Alexander Parker, and Robert Widders. When we were come out of the town, they asked me, 'Whither I would go?' I told them, <Q>It was upon me from the Lord to go back again to Johnstons (the town out of which we had been lately thrust) and to set the power of God and his truth over them also.</Q> Alexan∣der Parker said, 'He would go along with me;' and I wish∣ed the other two to stay at a town about three miles from Edinburgh till we returned. Then Alexander Parker and I got over the water, which was about three miles over, and rode through the country; but in the afternoon, his horse being weak and not able to hold up with mine, I put on and got into Johnstons just as they were drawing up the bridges, the officers and soldiers never questioning me. I rode up the street to captain Davenport's, from whence we had been banished. There were many officers with him: and when I came amongst them they lifted up their hands, admiring that I should come again; but I told them, <Q>The Lord God had sent me amongst them again.</Q> They went their way; and the Baptists sent me a letter, by way of chal∣lenge, 'That they would discourse with me the next day.' I sent them word, <Q>I would meet them at such a house, about half a mile out of the town, at such an hour.</Q> For I considered, if I should stay in town to discourse with them, they might, under pretence of discoursing with me, have raised men to put me out of town again, as they had done before. At the time appointed I went to the place, captain Davenport and his son accompanying me; where I staid some hours, but not one of them came. While I staid waiting for them, I espied Alexander Parker coming; who not being able to reach the town, had lain out the night before; and I was exceeding glad that we were met again.</P>
<P>Captain Davenport was then loving to friends; but af∣terwards coming more into obedience to truth, he was turn∣ed out of his place, for not putting off his hat, and for say-Thou and Thee to them.</P>
<P>When we had waited beyond reasonable ground to expect any of their coming we departed; and Alexander Parker being moved to go again to the town where we had the meet∣ing at the market-cross, I passed alone to licutenant Fos∣ter's
<PB N="349" REF="037441_0426_100D90B96EC49090"/>quarters, where I found several officers that were con∣vinced. From thence I went to the town where I had left the other two friends, and they and I went back to Edin∣burgh together.</P>
<P>When we were come to the city, I bid Robert Widders follow me; and in the dread and power of the Lord we came up to the two first centries, and the Lord's power came so over them, that we passed by them without any examina∣tion. Then we rode up the street to the market-place, and by the main-guard out at the gate by the third centry, and so clear out at the suburbs, and there came to an inn and set up our horses, it being seventh-day. Now I saw and felt that we had rode, as it were, against the cannon's mouth or the sword's point; but the Lord's power and im∣mediate hand carried us over the heads of them all. Next day I went to the meeting in the city, friends having notice I would attend it. There came many officers and soldiers to it, and a glorious meeting it was; the everlasting power of God was set over the nation, and his Son reigned in his glorious power. All was quiet, and no man offered to meddle with me. When the meeting was ended, and I had visited friends, I came out of the city to my inn again. The next day, being second-day, we set forward towards the borders of England.</P>
<P>As we travelled along the country I espied a steeple-house, and it struck at my life. I asked, what steeple-house it was? and was answered, it was Dunbar. When I came thither, and had set up at an inn, I walked to the steeple∣house, having a friend or two with me. When we came to the steeple-house yard, one of the chief men of the town was walking there. I spoke to one of the friends that was with me, <Q>To go to him, and tell him, that about the ninth hour next morning there would be a meeting there of the people of God called Quakers; of which we desired he would give notice to the people of the town.</Q> He sent me word, <Q>That they were to have a lecture there by the ninth hour; but that we might have our meeting there by the eighth hour if we would.</Q> We concluded so, and desired him to give notice of it. Accordingly in the morning both poor and rich came; and there being a captain of horse quartered in the town, he and his troopers came also, so that we had a large concourse: and a glorious meeting it was, the Lord's power being over all. After some time the priest came, and went into the steeple-house; but we being in the yard,
<PB N="350" REF="037441_0427_100D90BB03DCCCD0"/>most of the people staid with us. Friends were so full, and their voices so high in the power of God, that the priest could do little in the house, but came quickly out again, stood awhile, and then went his way. I opened to the people, <Q>Where they might find Christ Jesus, turned them to the light, which he had enlightened them withal, that in the light they might see Christ who died for them, turn to him, and know him to be their Saviour and teacher; let them see, that the teachers they had hitherto followed were hirelings, who made the gospel chargeable; shewed them the wrong ways they had walked in, in the night of apostacy, directed them to Christ, the new and living way to God; manifested unto them, how they had lost the re∣ligion and worship which Christ set up in spirit and truth, and had hitherto been in the religions and worships of men's making and setting up; and after I had turned the people to the Spirit of God, which led the holy men of God to give forth the scriptures, and shewed them that they must also come to receive and be led by the same Spirit in themselves (a measure of which was given unto every one of them) if ever they came to know God and Christ and the scriptures aright, perceiving the other friends to be full of power and the word of the Lord, I stepped down, giving way for them to declare what they had from the Lord to the people.</Q> Towards the latter end of the meeting some professors began to jangle; whereupon I stood up again and answered their questions, so that they seemed to be satisfied and our meeting ended in the Lord's power, quiet and peaceable. This was the last meeting I had in Scotland. The truth and the power of God was set over that nation, and many, by the power and Spirit of God were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, their Saviour and Teacher, whose blood was shed for them; and there is since a great increase, and great there will be in Scotland, tho' the time may be far distant at present. For when first I set my horse's feet upon Scottish ground, I felt the seed of God to sparkle about me, like innumerable sparks of fire. Not but that there is abundance of thick, cloddy earth of hy∣pocrisy and salseness atop, and a briery, brambly nature, which is to be burned up with God's word, and plowed up with his spiritual plough, before God's seed brings forth heavenly and spiritual fruit to his glory. But the husband∣man is to wait in patience.</P>
<P>From Dunbar we came to Berwick, where we were ques∣tioned
<PB N="351" REF="037441_0428_100D90BCEC258F38"/>a little by the officers; but the governor was loving towards us, and in the evening we had a little meeting, in which the power of the Lord was manifested over all.</P>
<P>Leaving Berwick we came to Morpeth, and through the country, visiting friends, to Newcastle, where I had been once before. The Newcastle priests wrote many books against us, and one Ledger, an alderman of the town, was very envious against truth and friends. He and the priests had said, <Q>The Quakers would not come into any great towns, but lived in the fells like butterflies.</Q> I took An∣thony Pearson with me, and went to this Ledger and seve∣ral others of the aldermen; <Q>desiring to have a meeting amongst them, seeing they had written so many books against us: for we were now come, I told them, into their great town.</Q> But they would not yield we should have a meeting, neither would they be spoke with, save only this Ledger and one other. I queried, <Q>Had they not called friends butterflies, and said, We would not come into any great towns? And now we were in their town, they would not come at us, tho they had printed books against us: who are the butterflies now?</Q> Then Ledger began to plead <Q>for the sabbath-day. I told him, They kept markets and fairs on that which was the sabbath-day, for that was the seventh day of the week; whereas that day which the pro∣fessed christians now meet, on, and call their sabbath, is the first day of the week.</Q> As we could not have a pub∣lick meeting among them, we got a little meeting among friends and friendly people at the Gate-side; where a meet∣ing is continued to this day in the name of Jesus. As I was passing by the market-place the power of the Lord rose in me <Q>to warn them of the day of the Lord that was com∣ing upon them.</Q> And not long after, all those priests of Newcastle and their profession were turned out when the king came in.</P>
<P>From Newcastle we travelled, having meetings and visit∣ing friends, in Northumberland and Bishoprick. A very good meeting we had at lieutenant Dove's, where many were turned to the Lord and his teaching. After which I went to visit a justice of peace, a very sober, loving man, who confessed to the truth.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Durham, where was a man come from London to set up a college to make ministers of Christ, as they said. I went with some others to reason with the man, and to let him see, <Q>That to teach men He∣brew,
<PB N="352" REF="037441_0429_100D90BF46081528"/>Greek, Latin, and the seven arts, which were all but the teachings of the natural man, was not the way to make them ministers of Christ. For the languages began at Babel; and to the Greeks, that spoke Greek as their mother-tongue, the preaching of the cross of Christ was soolishness; and to the Jews, that spoke Hebrew as their mother-tongue, Christ was a stumbling-block. The Ro∣mans, who had the Latin, persecuted the Christians; and Pilate, one of the Roman governors, set Hebrew, Greek, and Latin atop of Christ when he crucified him. So he might see the many languages began at Babel, and they set them atop of Christ, the Word, when they crucified him. John the divine, who preached the Word which was in the beginning, said, <Q>That the beast and the whore have power over tongues and languages, and they are as wa∣ters.</Q> Thus, I told him, he might see the whore and the beast have power over the tongues and the many languages, which are in mystery Babylon; for they began at Babel, and the persecutors of Christ Jesus set them over him, when he was crucified by them; but he is risen over them all, who was before them all. Now (said I to this man) dost thou think to make ministers of Christ by these na∣tural, confused languages which sprung from Babel, are admired in Babylon, and set atop of Christ, the Life, by a persecutor? Oh, no!</Q> The man confessed to many of these things. Then we shewed him further, <Q>That Christ made his ministers himself, gave gifts unto them, and bid them <Q>Pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send forth labourers.</Q> And Peter and John, though unlearned and ignorant as to school-learning, preached Christ Jesus the Word, which was in the beginning, before Babel was. Paul also was made an apostle, not of man, nor by man, neither received he the gospel from man, but from Jesus Christ; who is the same now, and so is the gospel, as it was at that day.</Q> When we had thus discoursed with him, he became very loving and tender: and after he had considered further of it, declined to set up his college.</P>
<P>From Durham we went to Anthony Pearson's, from thence into Cleveland, and passed through Yorkshire to the further and of Holderness, and had mighty meetings, the Lord's power accompanying us.</P>
<P>After we passed from. Anthony Pearson's, we went by Hust and Pomsret to George Watkinson<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and visited most of the meetings in these parts, till we came to Scale house,
<PB N="353" REF="037441_0430_100D90C12CB4B7A8"/>and so, to Swarthmore; the everlasting power and arm of God carrying us through and preserving us. After I had visited friends there-away, I passed into Yorkshire and Cheshire, and so through other counties into Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire; and glorious meetings we had, the Lord's presence being with us.</P>
<P>At Nottingham I sent to Rice Jones, desiring him <Q>to acquaint his people that I had something to say to them from the Lord.</Q> He came and told me, <Q>Many of them lived in the country, and he could not tell how to send to them.</Q> I told him, <Q>He might acquaint them about the town of it, and send to as many in the country as he could.</Q> The next day we met at the castle, there being about fourscore people, to whom I declared the truth for about the space of two hours; and the Lord's power was over them all, so that they had not power to open their mouths in opposition. When I had done, one of them asked me a question, which I was loth to have answered; for I saw it might lead into jangling, and was unwilling to go into jangling, for some of the people were tender; yet I could not well tell how to escape it. Wherefore I an∣swered the question, and was moved forthwith to speak to Rice Jones, and lay before him, <Q>That he had been the man who had scattered such as had been tender, and some that had been convinced and had been led out of the va∣nities of the world, which he had formerly judged; but now he judged the power of God in them, and they being simple turned to him; so he and they were turned to be vainer than the world: for many of his followers were become the greatest foot-ball players and wrestlers in the whole country. I told them it was the serpent in him that had scattered and done hurt to such as were tender towards the Lord. Nevertheless, if he waited in the fear of God for the seed of the woman, Christ Jesus, to bruise the serpent's head in him, that had scattered and done the hurt; he might come to gather them again by this heaven∣ly seed; though it would be an hard work for him, to ga∣ther them again out of those vanities he had led them into.</Q> At this Rice Jones said, <Q>Thou liest, it is not the seed of the woman that bruises the serpent's head.</Q> 'No! said I, 'what is it then? "I say, it is the law," said he. 'But 'said I, the scripture, speaking of the seed of the woman, saith. "It shall bruise thy head, and thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bruise his "heel" now, hath the law an heel, said I, to be bruised?'
<PB N="354" REF="037441_0431_100D90C2BB95E418"/>Then Rice Jones and all his company were at a stand, and I was moved in the power of the Lord to say, <Q>This seed, Christ Jesus, the seed of the woman, which should bruise the serpent's head, shall brurse thy head, and break you all in pieces.</Q> Thus I left on the heads of them the seed, Christ; and not long after he and his company scattered to pieces; several of whom came to be friends, and stand to this day. Many of them had been convinced about eight years before, but had been led aside by this Rice Jones: for they denied the inward cross, the power of God, and so went into vanity. It was about eight years, since I had been formerly amongst them; in which time I was to pass over them, and by them, seeing they had slighted the Lord's truth and power, and the visitation of his love unto them. But now was the time that I was moved to go to them again, and it was of great-service; for many of them were brought to the Lord Jesus Christ, and were settled upon him, sitting down under his teaching and feeding, where they were kept fresh and green; and the others that would not be gathered to him soon after withered. This was that Rice Jones, who had some years before said, <Q>I was then at the highest, and should fall;</Q> but, poor man: he little thought how near his own fall was.</P>
<P>We left Nottingham, and went into Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, and Leicestershire, visiting friends, and having meetings as we travelled. We came into Bedford∣shire, where we had large gatherings in the name of Jesus. After some time we came to John Crook's, where a general yearly meeting for the whole nation was appointed to be held. This meeting lasted three days, and many friends from most parts of the nation came to it; so that the inns and towns round thereabouts were filled, for many thou∣sands of people were at it. And although there was some disturbance by some rude people that had run out from truth; yet the Lord's power came over all, and a glorious meeting it was. The everlasting gospel was preached, and many received it, which gospel brought life and immortality to light in them, and shined over all.</P>
<P>I was moved by the Power and Spirit of the Lord to open unto them the <Q>promise of God, that it was made to the seed, not to seeds, as many, but to one; which seed was Christ: and that all people, both male and female, should feel this seed in them, which was heir of the pro∣mise, that so they might all witness Christ in them, the
<PB N="355" REF="037441_0432_100D90C450E05BB8"/>hope of glory, the mystery which had been hid from ages and generations, which was revealed to the apostles, and is revealed again now, after the long night of apostacy. So that all might come up into this seed, Christ Jesus, walk in it, and sit down together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, who was the foundation of the prophets and apos∣tles, the rock of ages, and is our foundation now. All sitting down in him, sit down in the substance, the first and the last, that changes not, the seed that bruises the serpent's head, which was before he was, who ends all the types, figures, and shadows, and is the substance of them all; in whom there is no shadow.</Q> Now, these things were upon me to open unto all, that they might mind and see what it is they sit down in.</P>
<P>First, They that sit down in Adam in the fall, sit down in misery, in death, in darkness and corruption.</P>
<P>Secondly, They that sit down in the types, figures, and shadows, and under the first priesthood, law, and covenant, sit down in that which must have an end, and which made nothing perfect.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They that sit down in the apostacy, that hath got up since the apostles days, sit down in spiritual Sodom and Egypt; and are drinking of the whore's cup, under the beast's and dragon's power.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They that sit down in the state in which Adam was before he fell, sit down in that which may be sallen from; for he fell from that state, though it was perfect.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They that sit down in the prophets, sit down in that which must be fulfilled: and they that sit down in the fellowship of water, bread, and wine, these being tem∣poral things, they sit down in that which is short of Christ, and of his baptism.</P>
<P>Sixthly, To sit down in a profession of all the scriptures, from Genesis to the Revelations, and not be in the pow∣er and Spirit which those were in that gave them forth; that was to be turned away from, by them that came into the power and Spirit which those were in that gave forth the scriptures.</P>
<P>Seventhly, They that sit down in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, sit down in him that never fell, nor ever changed. Here is the safe sitting for all his elect, his church, his spiritual members, of which he is the living head, his living stones, the household of faith; of which
<PB N="356" REF="037441_0433_100D90C6A1804758"/>house he is the corner-stone, that stands and abides all weathers. "For", as the apostle said, <Q>he hath quick∣ened us, who were dead in sins and trespasses, &amp;c. and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us, through Jesus Christ.</Q> Now the ages are come, that his kindness and exceeding riches towards us through Jesus Christ is truly manifested in us, as it was in the apostles days; even in us, who have been dead in sins and trespasses, as they were; but now are quickened, and made to sit together in the hea∣venty places in Christ Jesus, the first and the last, by whom all things were created; who is ascended above all, and is over all, and whose glorious presence is now known. All that sit down here, in Christ Jesus, see where all other people sit, and in what. The promise of God being to the seed, which is one, Christ Jesus, every man and woman must come to witness this seed, Christ in them, that they may be heirs of the promise; and inheriting that, they will inherit substance. These things were largely declared of; the state of the church, and the state of the false church since the apostles days, opened; and how the true church fled into the wilderness: and the state of the false prophets, which Christ said should come, and John saw were come, and how all the world wondered after them; and how they had filled the world with false doctrines, ways, worships, and religions: and how the everlasting gospel is now preached again to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peo∣ple; for all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people had drunk the whore's cup, and she was over them, and sat up∣on them. In this night of apostacy the pure religion and worship in spirit, which was in the apostles days, the way of life and living faith, and the power and Holy Ghost were lost; but now they came to be set up again by Christ Jesus, his messengers and ministers of the gospel, as in the apostles days. For as Christ sent his disciples to go and preach the gospel into all the world, and after that, the false prophets and antichrists went over the world, and preach∣ed their false doctrines and traditions, and heathenish and Jewish rudiments, so now again the everlasting gospel must be preached to all nations, and to every creature, that they may come into the pure religion, to worship God in the Spirit and truth, and may know Christ Jesus, their way to God, to be the author of their faith, and may re∣ceive
<PB N="357" REF="037441_0434_100D90C90A4C2778"/>the gospel from heaven, and not from men; in which gospel, received from heaven, is the heavenly fellowship, which is a mystery to all the fellowships in the world.' After these things had been largely opened, with many others concerning Christ Jesus and his kingdom, and the people were turned to the divine light of Christ and his Spirit, by which they might come to know God and Christ, and the scriptures, and to have fellowship with them, and one with another in the same Spirit, I was moved to de∣clare and open divers other things to those friends who had received a part of the ministry, concerning the exercise of their spiritual gifts in the church: which, being taken in writing by one present, was after this manner;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKE heed of destroying that which ye have begot∣ten: for that which destroys, goes out, and is the cast-away. And though that be true, yea, and may be the pure truth which such an one speaks, yet if he doth not remain in that, and live in that in his particular, but goes out, the same which he is gone out from cometh over him. So that which calms and cools the spirits, goes over the world, and brings to the Father, to inherit the life eternal; and reaches to the spirits in prison in all. Therefore in the living, immovable Word of the Lord God dwell, in the renown thereof: and remain on the foundation that is pure, and that is sure: for whosoever goes out from the pure, and ministers not in and from that, he comes to an end, and doth not remain; although he may have had a time, and may have been serviceable for a time, while he lived in the thing.</P>
<P>Take heed of many words; what reacheth to the life, settles in the life. That which cometh from the life, and is received from God, reacheth to the life, and settles others in the life: the work is not now as it was at first; the work now is, to settle and stay in the life. For as friends have been led to minister in the power, and the power hath gone through, so that there hath grown an under∣standing among both people of the world and friends, so friends must be kept in the life which is pure, that with that they may answer the pure life of God in others. If friends do not live in the pure life which they speak of, to answer the life in those they speak to, the other part steps in; and so there comes up an outward acquaintance,
<PB N="358" REF="037441_0435_100D90CA9DC56620"/>and he lets that come over him. But as every one is kept living in the life of God, over all that which is con∣trary, they are in their places; then they do not lay hands on any suddenly, which is the danger now: for if any one do, he may lose his discerning, may lay hands on the wrong part, so let the deceit come too near him; and the deceit will steal over, so that it will be an hard thing for him to get it down. There is no one strikes his fellow-ser∣vants, but first he is gone from the pure in his own parti∣cular; for when he goeth from the light he is enlightened withal, then he strikes; and then he hath his reward: the light, which he is gone from, Christ, comes and gives him his reward. This is the state of the evil servants. The boisterous, the hasty and rash, beget nothing to God; but the life, which doth reach the life, is that which begets to God. When all are settled in the life they are in that which remains for ever; and what is received there, is re∣ceived from the Lord; and what one receiveth from the Lord, he keepeth; so he sitteth still, cool, and quiet in his own spirit, and gives it forth as he is moved; but to the harlots, judgment.</P>
<P>Friends, This is the word of the Lord to you all, be watchful and careful in all meetings ye come into; for where friends are sitting together in silence, they are many times gathered into their own measures. When a man is come newly out of the world, from ministering to the world's people, he cometh out of the dirt; and then he had need take heed that he be not rash. For when he comes into a silent meeting, that is another state; then he must come, and feel his own spirit, how it is when he comes to them that sit silent. If he be rash, they will judge him; that having been in the world, and amongst the world, the heat is not yet off him. For he may come in the heat of his spirit out of the world; whereas the others are still and cool; and his condition in that, not be∣ing agreeable to theirs, he may rather do them hurt, by begetting them out of the cool state into the heating state; if he be not in that which commands his own spirit, and gives him to know it.</P>
<P>There is great danger too in travelling abroad in the world. The same power, that moves any to go forth, is that which must keep them. For it is the greatest danger to go abroad, except a man be moved of the Lord, and go in the power of the Lord; for then, he keeping in the
<PB N="359" REF="037441_0436_100D90CC2FA01F98"/>power, is kept by it in his journey, and in his work; it will enable him to answer the transgressed, and keep above the transgressor. Every one feeling the danger to his own par∣ticular in travelling abroad, there the pure fear of the Lord will be placed and kept in. Though they that travel may have openings when they are abroad, to minister to others; yet, for their own particular growth, they must dwell in the life which doth open; and that will keep down that which would boast. For the minister cornes into the death, to that which is in the death and in prison: and so returns up again into the life, into the power, and into the wisdom, to preserve him clean.</P>
<P>This is the word of the Lord God to you all; feel, that ye stand in the presence of the Lord; for every man's word shall be his burden; but the word of the Lord is pure, and answers the pure in every one. The Word of the Lord is that which was in the beginning, and brings to the begin∣ning. It is an hammer to beat down the transgressor (not the transgressed) and as a fire to burn up that which is con∣trary to it. Friends, come into that which is over all the spirits of the world, fathoms all the spirits of the world, and stands in the patience; with that ye may see where others stand, and reach that which is of God in every one. Here is no strife, no contention, out of transgression: for he that goeth into strife, and into contention, he is from the pure Spirit. For where any goeth into contention, if any thing hath been begotten by him before, that conten∣tious nature doth get atop, spoileth that which was begot∣ten, and quencheth his own prophesying. So if that be not subjected by the power in the particular, which would arise into strife, that is dangerous.</P>
<P>If any one have a moving to any place, and have spo∣ken what they were moved of the Lord, let them return to their habitation again, and live in the pure life of God, and in the fear of the Lord; so will ye be kept in the life, in the solid and seasoned spirit, and preach as well in life as with words (none must be light or wild.) For the feed of God is weighty, brings to be solid, and leads into the wisdom of God, by which the wisdom of the creation is known. But if that part be up which runs into the ima∣ginations, and that part be standing in which the imagi∣nations come up, and the pure spirit be not thoroughly come up to rule and reign, then that will run out that will glory, boast, and vapour; and so will such an one
<PB N="360" REF="037441_0437_100D90CE93F58710"/>spoil that which opened to him; this is for condemnation. Let every one mind that which feels through and com∣mands his spirit, whereby every one may know what spi∣rit he is of; for he should first try his own spirit, and then he may try others; he should first know his own spirit, and then he may know others. Therefore that which doth command all these spirits, where the heats and burnings come in and get up, in that wait which chains them down and cools: that is the elect, the heir of the promise of God. For no hasty, rash, brittle spirits (though they have prophecies) have held out, and gone through, they not being subjected in the prophecy. The earthly will not abide, for it is brittle; in that state the ministry was another's, not the Son's; for the Son hath life in himself, and the Son hath the power, which man being obedient to, he may be serviceable: but if he go from the pure power, he falls and abuseth it. Therefore let your faith stand in the pure power of the Lord God, and do not abuse it; but let that search through, and work through; and let every one stand in the power of the Lord, which reacheth the seed of God; which is the heir of the promise of life without end. Let none be hasty to speak; for ye have time enough, and with an eye ye may reach the wit∣ness; neither let any be backward when ye are moved; for that brings destruction. Truth hath an honour in the hearts of those who are not friends; so that all friends be∣ing kept in the truth, they are kept in the honour, they are honourable, for that will honour them; but if any lose the power, lose the life, they lose their crown, they lose their honour, they lose the cross which should crucify them, and they crucify the just; and by losing the power, the Lamb comes to be slain. And as it is here, so will it be in other nations; for all friends, here and there, are as one family: the seed, the plants, they are as a family. All being kept in that which subjects all, and keeps all under, to wit, the seed itself, the life itself, that is the heir of the promise; and that is the bond of peace: for there is the unity in the Spirit with God and with one another. He that is kept in the life hears God, and sees man's con∣dition; and with that he answers the life in others that hear God also: thus one friend, that is come into that, comprehends the world. But that which friends speak, they must live in; so may they expect that others may come into that which they speak, to live in the same. For
<PB N="361" REF="037441_0438_100D90D0D883F870"/>the power of the Lord God hath been abused by some, and the worth of truth hath not been minded. There hath been a trampling on, and marring with the feet, and that abuseth the power. But now every friend is to keep in the power, and to take heed to it; for that must be kept down which would trample and mar with the feet, and the pure life and power of God is to be lived in over that; that none with the feet might foul or mar, but every one may be kept in the pure power and life of the Lord. Then the water of life cometh in; then he that minister∣eth drinketh himself, and giveth others to drink.</P>
<P>When any shall be moved to go to speak in a steeple-house or market, turn in to that which moves, and be obedient to it; that that which would not go may be kept down: for that which would not go will be apt to get up. And take heed on the other hand, that the lavishing part do not get up, for it is a bad savour; therefore that must be kept down and kept subject. Wait in the light of the Lord that ye may be all kept in the wisdom of God. For when the seed is up in every particular, there is no dan∣ger; but when there is an opening and prophecy, and the power stirs before the seed comes up, there is something that will be apt to run out rashly; there's the danger, and there must be the patience in the fear. For it is a weighty thing to be in the work of the ministry of the Lord God, and to go forth in that. It is not as a customary preach∣ing; it is to bring people to the end of all outward preach∣ing. For when ye have declared the truth to the people, and they have received it, and are come into that which ye spake of; the uttering of many words, and long de∣clarations out of the life, may beget them into a form. And if any should run on rashly into words again, with∣out the savour of life, those that are come into the thing he spake of will judge him; whereby he may hurt again that which he had raised up before. So friends, ye must all come into the thing that is spoken in the openings of the heavenly life among you, and walk in the love of God, that ye may answer the thing spoken to.</P>
<P>And take heed all of running into inordinate affections; for when people come to own you, there is danger of the wrong part getting up. There was a strife among the dis∣ciples of Christ, who should be the greatest? Christ told them, <Q>The heathen excrcise lordship, and have domi∣nion over one another; but it shall not be so among

That part in the disciples, which looked to be the greatest, was the same that was in the Gentiles. But who comes here to live in the Word that sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctified him, having the heart sanctified, the tongue and lips sanctified, living in the Word of wis∣dom, that makes clean the heart, and reconciles to God, all things being upheld by the Word and power; as there is an abiding in the Word of God, that upholds times and seasons, and gives all things increase, here dwelling in the Word of wisdom, if there be but two or three agreed in this on earth, it shall be done for them in hea∣ven. So in this must all things be ordered by the Word of wisdom and power, that upholds all things, the times and the seasons, that are in the Father's hands; to the glory of God, whereby his blessing may be felt among you; and this brings to the beginning. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, Keep down, keep low, that nothing may rule nor reign in you, but life itself.</P>
<P>The power being lived in, the cross is lived in; and where-ever friends come in this, they draw the power and the life over; they leave a witness behind them, answering the witness of God in others. Where this is lived in, there is no want of wisdom, no want of power, no want of knowledge; he that ministereth in this, seeth with the eye which the Lord openeth in him, what is for the fire, and what is for the sword, what must be fed with judgment, and what must be nourished. This brings all down, and to be low, every one keeping to the power; for let a man get up ever so high, he must come down again to the power where he left; what he went from, he must come down again to that. Before all these wicked spirits be got down, which are rambling abroad, friends must have pa∣tience, must wait in the patience, in the cool life; and who is in this doing the work of the Lord, he hath the tasting and the feeling of the Lamb's power and authority. There∣fore all friends, keep cool and quiet in the power of the Lord God; and all that is contrary will be subjected; the Lamb hath the victory, in the seed, through the patience.</P>
<P>If any have been moved to speak, and have quenched that which moved them, let none such go forth afterwards into words, until they feel the power to arise and move them thereto again; for after the first motion is quenched,
<PB N="363" REF="037441_0440_100D90D4556A3938"/>the other part will be apt to get up; and if any go forth in that, he goeth forth in his own, and the betrayer will come into that—And all friends, be careful not to med∣dle with the powers of the earth; but keep out of all such things; as ye keep in the Lamb's authority, ye will answer that of God in them, and bring them to do justice, which is the end of the law. Keep out of all jangling; for all that are in the transgression are out from the law of love; but all that are in the law of love come to the Lamb's power, in the Lamb's authority, who is the end of the law outward. For the law being added because of transgres∣sion, Christ, who was glorified with the Father before the world begain, in the end of the law; bringing them that live in the law of life, to live over all transgression; which every particular must feel in himself.</P>

<P>More was then spoken to many of these particulars; which was not taken at large as delivered.</P>
<P>After this meeting was over, and most of the friends gone away, as I was walking in John Crook's garden, there came a party of horse, with a constable, to seize me. I heard them ask, 'Who was in the house?' Somebody made an∣swer, 'I was there.' They said, <Q>I was the man they looked for;</Q> and went forthwith into the house, where they had many words with John Crook, and some few friends that were with him. But the Lord's power so confounded them, that they came not into the garden to look for me; but went their way in a rage. When I came into the house, friends were very glad to see them so disappointed, and that I had escaped them. Next day I passed from thence: and after I had visited friends in several places, came to London, the Lord's power accompanying me, and bearing me up in his service.</P>
<P>I had not been long in London, before I heard that a Jesuit, who came over with an embassador from Spain, had challenged all the Quakers to dispute with them at the earl of Newport's house; whereupon some friends let him know some would meet him. Then he sent us word, <Q>He would meet with twelve of the wisest learned men we had.</Q> Awhile after he sent us word, <Q>He would meet with but six;</Q> after that, he sent us word again, <Q>He would have but three to come.</Q> We hastened what we could. lest, for all his great boast, he should put it quite off at last. When we were come to the house, I bid Nicholas Bond
<PB N="364" REF="037441_0441_100D90D6A7FD2AD8"/>and Edward Burrough go up, and enter the discourse with him; and I would walk awhile in the yard, and then come up after them. I advised them to state this question to him, <Q>Whether or no the church of Rome, as it now stood, was not degenerated from the true church which was in the pri∣mitive times, from the life and doctrine, and from the pow∣er and spirit that they were in?</Q> They stated the question accordingly: and the Jesuit affirmed, <Q>That the church of Rome now was in the virginity and purity of the primi∣tive church.</Q> By this time I was come to them. Then we asked him, <Q>Whether they had the Holy Ghost poured out upon them, as the apostles had?</Q> He said, 'No.' 'Then,' said I, <Q>If ye have not the same Holy Ghost poured forth upon you, and the same power and Spirit that the apostles had, ye are degenerated from the power and Spirit which the primitive church was in.</Q> There needed little more to be said to that. Then I asked him, <Q>What scripture they had for setting up cloysters for nuns, abbeys and monasteries for men; for all their several or∣ders; for their praying by beads, and to images; for making crosses; for forbidding of meats and marriages; and for putting people to death for religion? If, (said I) ye are in the practice of the primitive church, in its pu∣rity and virginity, then let us see by scriptures where-ever they practised any such things?</Q> (For it was agreed on both hands, that we should make good by scriptures what we said.) Then he told us of a written word, and an un∣written word? I asked him what he called his unwritten word? He said, <Q>The written word is the scriptures, and the unwritten word is that which the apostles spoke by word of mouth; which (said he) are all those traditions that we practise.</Q> I bid him prove that by scripture. Then he brought that scripture where the apostle says, 2 Thess. ii. 5. <Q>When I was with you, I told you these things. That is,</Q> said he, <Q>I told you of nunneries and monasteries, and of putting to death for religion, and of praying by beads, and to images, and all the rest of the practices of the church of Rome; which,</Q> he said, <Q>was the unwritten word of the apostles, which they told then, and have since been continued down by tradition unto these times.</Q> Then I desired him to read that scripture <Q>again, that he might see how he had perverted the apos∣tles words; for that which the apostle there tells the Thessalonians, "he had told them before," is not an un∣written
<PB N="365" REF="037441_0442_100D90D8C4CBEF90"/>word, but is there written down; namely, That the man of sin, the son of perdition, shall be revealed be∣fore the great and terrible day of Christ, which he was writing of, should come: so this was not telling them any of those things that the church of Rome practises. In like manner the apostle, in the third chapter of that epis∣tle,</Q> tells the church of some disorderly persons, <Q>he heard were amongst them, busy-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had commanded them by his unwritten word, when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither should he eat: which now he commands them again in his written word in this epis∣tle</Q> 2 Thess. iii. So this scripture afforded no proof for their invented traditions, and he had no other scripture-proof to offer. Therefore I told him, <Q>This was another degeneration of their church into such inventions and tra∣ditions as the apostles and primitive saints never practised.</Q></P>
<P>After this he came to his sacrament of the altar, begin∣ning at the paschal lamb, and the shew-bread, and came to the words of Christ, 'This is my body,' and to what the apostle wrote of it to the Corinthians; concluding, <Q>That after the priest had consecrated the bread and wine, it was immortal and divine, and he that received it, received the whole Christ.</Q> I followed him through the scriptures he brought, till I came to Christ's words and the apostle's. I shewed him, <Q>That the same apostle told the Corinthi∣ans, after they had taken bread and wine in remembrance of Christ's death, that they were reprobates, <Q>if Christ was not in them;</Q> but if the bread they ate was Christ, he must of necessity be in them after they had eaten it. Besides, if this bread and this wine, which the Corinthians ate and drank, was Christ's body, then how hath Christ a body in heaven? I observed to him also, <Q>That both the disciples at the supper, and the Corinthians afterwards, were to eat the bread and drink the wine in <Q>remem∣brance of Christ.</Q> and to <Q>shew forth his death till he come;</Q> which plainly proves the bread and wine, which they took, was not his body. For if it had been his real body that they ate, then he had been come, and was then there present, and it had been improper to have done such a thing in remembrance of him, if he had been then pre∣sent with them, as the must have been, if that bread and wine which they ate and drank had been his real body.</Q> As to those words of Christ, 'This is my body,' I told him,
<PB N="366" REF="037441_0443_100D90DA55790A30"/><Q>Christ calls himself a vine, and a door, and is called in scripture a rock. Is Christ therefore an outward rock, door, or vine?</Q> O, said the Jesuit, <Q>Those words are to be interpreted;</Q> so, said I, are those words of Christ, "This is my body." Having stopped his mouth as to ar∣gument, I made the Jesuit a proposal thus; That seeing he said, <Q>The bread and wine was immortal and divine, and the very Christ; and that whosoever received it, re∣ceived the whole Christ;</Q> let a meeting be appointed be∣tween some whom the pope and his cardinals should ap∣point, and some of us; let a bottle of wine and loaf of bread be brought, and divided each into two parts, and let them consecrate which of those parts they would. Then set the consecrated and the unconsecrated bread and wine in a safe place, with a sure watch upon it; and let trial be thus made, Whether the consecrated bread and wine would not lose its goodness, and the bread grow dry and mouldy, and the wine turn dead and sour, as well and as soon as that which was unconsecrated? By this means, said I, the truth of this matter may be made manifest. And if the consecrated bread and wine change not, but retain their savour and goodness, this may be a means to draw many to your church: if they change, decay, and lose their goodness, then ought you to confess and forsake your error, and shed no more blood about it: for much blood hath been shed about these things; as in queen Ma∣ry's days.</Q> To this the Jesuit made this reply, "Take," said he, <Q>a piece of new cloth, and cut it into two pieces, and make two garments of it, and put one of them upon king David's back, and the other upon a beggar's, and the one garment shall wear away as well as the other.</Q> <Q>Is this thy answer, said I? Yes, said he. Then, said I, by this the company may all be satisfied that your conse∣crated bread and wine is not Christ. Have ye told peo∣ple so long, that the consecrated bread and wine was im∣mortal and divine, and that it was the very and real body and blood of Christ, and dost thou now say it will wear away or decay as well as the other! I must tell thee, "Christ remains the same to day as yesterday," and never decays; but is the saints heavenly food in all generations, through which they have life.</Q> He replied no more to this, being willing to let it fall; for the people that were present saw his error, and that he could not defend it. Then I asked him, <Q>Why their church did persecute, and
<PB N="367" REF="037441_0444_100D90DBE65ACD48"/>put people to death for religion?</Q> He replied, <Q>It was not the church that did it, but the magistrates.</Q> I asked him, <Q>Whether those magistrates were not counted and called believers and christians?</Q> He said, Yes: <Q>Why then, said I, are they not members of your church?</Q> 'Yes,' said he. Then I left it to the people to judge from his own concessions, whether the church of Rome doth not perse∣cute, and put people to death for religion. Thus we part∣ed, and his subtilty was consuted by simplicity.</P>
<P>During the time I was at London, I had many services lay upon me; for it was a time of much suffering. I was moved to write to O. Cromwel, and lay before him the suf∣ferings of friends both in this nation and in Ireland. There was also a talk about this time of making Cromwel king; where∣upon I was moved to go to him, and warned him against accepting it, and of divers dangers; which if he did not avoid, I told him, <Q>He would bring shame and ruin upon himself and his posterity.</Q> He seemed to take well what I said to him, and thanked me; yet afterwards I was mov∣ed to write to him more fully concerning that matter.</P>
<P>About this time the lady Claypool (so called) was sick and much troubled in mind, and could receive no comfort from any that came to her; which when I heard of, I was moved to write her the following letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE still and cool in thy own mind and spirit from thy own thoughts, and then thou wilt feel the principle of God to turn thy mind to the Lord, from whom life comes; whereby thou mayest receive his strength and power to allay all blusterings, storms and tempests. That is it which works up into patience, into innocency, into so∣bernes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, into stillness, into stayedness, into quietness up to God, with his power. Therefore mind, that is the word of the Lord unto thee, that the authority of God thou mayst feel, and thy faith in it, to work down that which troubles thee; for that is it which keeps peace and brings up the witness in thee, which hath been transgressed, to feel after God with his power and life, who is a God of order and peace. When thou art in the transgression of the life of God in thy own particular, the mind flies up in the air, the creature is led into the night, nature goes out of its course, an old garment goes on, and an uppermost clothing: and thy nature being led out of its course, it
<PB N="368" REF="037441_0445_100D90DDE3EA88C8"/>comes to be all on fire in the transgression, and that defac∣eth the glory of the first body. Therefore be still awhile from thy own thoughts, searching, seeking, desires, and imaginations, and be stayed in the principle of God in thee, that it may raise thy mind up to God, and stay it upon God, and thou wilt sind strength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a present help in the time of trouble and of need. And thou being come to the princi∣ple of God, which hath been transgressed, it will keep thee humble; and the humble God will teach his way, which is peace, and such he doth exalt. Now as the principle of God in thee hath been transgressed, come to it, that it may keep thy mind down low to the Lord God; to deny thy∣self, and from thy own will, that is the earthly, thou must be kept. Then thou wilt feel the power of God, which will bring nature into its course, and give thee to see the glory of the first body. There the wisdom of God will be received (which is Christ, by which all things were made and created) and thou be thereby preserved and ordered to God's glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the physician of value, who clothes people in their right mind, whereby they may serve God and do his will. For all distractions, unruliness, and confusion are in the trans∣gression; which transgression must be brought down, be∣fore the principle of God, which hath been transgressed against, be lifted up; whereby the mind may be seasoned and stilled, and a right understanding of the Lord may be received; whereby his blessings enter, and are felt over all that is contrary in the power of the Lord, which raises up the principle of God within, gives a feeling after God, and in time gives dominion. Keep in the fear of the Lord God; that is the word of the Lord unto thee. For all these things happen to thee for thy good, and for the good of those concerned for thee, to make you know yearselves and your own weakness, that ye may know the Lord's strength and power, and may trust in him. Let the time past be sufficient to every one, who in any thing hath been lifted up in transgression out of the power of the Lord; for he can bring down and abase the mighty, and lay them in the dust of the earth. Therefore, all keep low in his fear, that thereby ye may receive the secrets of God and his wisdom, may know the shadow of the Almighty, and sit under it in all tempests, storms, and heats. For God is a God at hand, and the Most High rules in the
<PB N="369" REF="037441_0446_100D90E085F8ABD8"/>children of men. This is the word of the Lord God un∣to you all; what the light doth make manifest and dis∣cover, as temptations, distractions, confusions; do not look at these temptations, confusions, corruptions, but at the light which discovers them and makes them manifest; and with the same light you may feel over them, to receive power to stand against them. The same light which lets you see sin and transgression, will let you see the covenant of God, which blots out your sin and transgression, which gives victory and dominion over it, and brings into cove∣nant with God. For looking down at sin, corruption, and distraction, ye are swallowed up in it; but looking at the light, which discovers them, ye will see over them. That will give victory, and ye will find grace and strength; there is the first step to peace. That will bring salvation; by it ye may see to the beginning, and the "Glory that "was with the Father before the world began;" and come to know the seed of God, which is the heir of the promise of God, and of the world which hath no end; and which bruises the head of the serpent, who stops people from coming to God. That ye may feel the power of an end∣less life, the power of God which is immortal, which brings the immortal soul up to the immortal God, in whom it doth rejoice. So in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty strengthen thee.</P>

<P>When the foregoing paper was read to her, she said, <Q>It stayed her mind for the present.</Q> Afterwards many friends got copies of it, both in England and Ireland, and read it to people that were troubled in mind; and it was made useful for the settling of the minds of several.</P>
<P>About this time came forth a declaration from O. Crom∣wel, the Protector, for a <Q>collection towards the relief of divers protestant churches,</Q> driven out of Poland, and of <Q>twenty protestant families, driven out of the confines of Bohemia.</Q> And there having been a like declaration pub∣lished some time before to invite the nation to a day of solemn fasting and humiliation, in order to a contribution to be made for the suffering protestants of the vallies of Lucern, Angrona, &amp;c. who were persecuted by the duke of Savoy; I was moved to write to the Protector and chief magistrates on this occasion, both to shew them the nature of a true fast (such as God requires and accepts) and to
<PB N="370" REF="037441_0447_100D90E215C58068"/>make them sensible of their injustice and self-condemnation in blaming the papists for persecuting the protestants abroad, while they, calling themselves protestants, were at the same time persecuting their protestant neighbours and friends at home. That which I wrote to them was after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the heads and governors of this nation, who have put forth a declaration for the keeping a day of so∣lemn fasting and humiliation, for the persecution (as you say) of divers people beyond the seas professing the reformed religion, which, ye say, hath been trans∣mitted unto them from their ancestors.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PROFESSION of the reformed religion may be trans∣mitted to generations, and so holden by tradition; and in that wherein the profession and tradition is holden, is the day of humiliation kept, which stands in the will of man. This is not the fast that the Lord requires, "To "bow down the head like a bulrush for a day," and the day following be in the same condition as they were the day before. To the light of Christ Jesus in your consciences. do I speak, which testifieth for God every day, and wit∣nesseth against all sin and persecution; which measure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a day, but leads to the fast the Lord requires, which is <Q>to loose, the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, to break every yoke, and to let the oppressed go free,</Q> Isa. lviii. 6, 7. This is the fast that the Lord requires, and this stands not in the transmission of times, nor in the tra∣ditions of men. But this stands in that which was before times were, and which leads out of time, and shall be when time shall be no more. These that teach for doctrine the commandments of men, are they that ever persecuted the life and power, when it came. And whereas ye mention a decree or edict that was made against the said persecuted protestants, all such decrees or edicts proceeded from the ground of the pope's religion and supremacy, and therein stands his tyranny and his cruelty, acted in that will which is in that nature which exerciseth lordship over one ano∣ther, as ye may read, Mark x. 42. Luke xxii. 25. as all the heathen do, and ever did; and in the heathenish na∣ture is all the tyranny and persecution exercised by them that are out of the obedience to the light of Christ Jesus in the conscience, which is the guide and leader of all,
<PB N="371" REF="037441_0448_100D90E3A6C33F90"/>who are tender of that of God in the conscience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to suffer for conscience sake. Now, whereas ye take into your conside∣ration the sad persecution, tyranny, and cruelty exercised upon them whom ye call your protestant brethren, and contribute and administer to their wants outwardly; this is good in its place, and we own it; and see it good to administer to the necessities of others, and to do good to all; and we, who are sufferers by a law derived from the pope, are willing to join and to contribute with you to their outward necessities. For <Q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof;</Q> who is good to all, gracious to all, and willing that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. But in the mean time, while ye are doing this, and taking notice of others cruelty, tyran∣ny, and persecution, turn your eye upon yourselves, and see what ye are doing at home. To the light of Christ Jesus in all your consciences I speak, which cannot lie, nor err, nor bear false witness; but doth bear witness for God, and cries for equity, justice, and righteousness to be executed. See what ye are doing who profess the scrip∣tures, which were given forth by the saints in light, who dwelt in the light and in the life of them. For these who now witness the same light, the same life, and the same power which gave forth the scriptures, which ye in words profess, them ye persecute, them ye hale out of your sy∣nagogues and markets; them ye beat, stock and imprison. Let that of God in your consciences, which is just, right∣eous, and equal, examine and try whether ye have any example or precedent to exercise this persecution, which many now in this nation suffer under, who are a people harmless and innocent, waiting in obedience towards God and man. And though ye account the way of truth they walk in heresy, yet therein do they exercise themselves, to have always a <Q>conscience void of offence towards God and man;</Q> as ye may read the saints of old did, Acts xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any man, neither giving any just cause of offence, only being obedient to the com∣mands of the Lord, to declare as they are moved by the Holy Ghost: and standing for the testimony of a good conscience, speaking the truth in Christ, their consciences bearing them witness that they lie not: for this do they suf∣fer under you, who in words profess the same thing for which they suffer. Now see if any age or generation did
<PB N="372" REF="037441_0449_100D90E6BAFF8FB8"/>ever persecute as ye do? For ye profess Christ Jesus who reveals the Father, and persecute those who witness the re∣velation of the Father by Christ Jesus unto them. Ye profess Christ Jesus, who is the light of the world, <Q>that enlightens every one that cometh into the world;</Q> yet per∣secute them that bear witness and give testimony to this light. Ye profess that the word is become flesh, yet perse∣cute them that witness it so. Ye profess that whosoever confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is an antichrist, yet persecute them that do confess him come in the flesh, and call them antichrists and deceivers. Ye pro∣fess that the kingdom of Christ is come, yet persecute them that witness it come. Ye profess Christ Jesus the resurrec∣tion and the life, yet persecute them that witness him to be so. If ye say, <Q>How shall we know that these people, who say they witness these things, do so or no?</Q> I an∣swer, Turn your minds to the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the light, ye shall have the light of life; then ye will know and see what ye have done, who have per∣secuted the Lord of Glory (in his people) in whom is life, and the life is the light of men. To no other touchstone shall we turn you, but into your own consciences; there may ye find the truth of what we have declared unto you, according to the holy scriptures. When the books of con∣sciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then shall ye witness us to be of God, and our testimony to be true. Though now ye may stop your ears, and harden your hearts, while it is called to-day, then ye shall know what ye have done, and whom ye have transgressed against; then ye will see that no persecutors, in any age or genera∣tion before you, did ever transgress against that light and measure of God made manifest in such manner as ye have done. For though Christ and the apostles were persecut∣ed in their time, the Jews for the most part did not know that he was the Christ when he came, notwithstanding they had the scriptures which prophesied of him, neither did they believe that he was risen again when the apostles preached his resurrection. But ye say, <Q>Ye believe he is come, ye believe his resurrection;</Q> yet ye persecute those that witness him come in the flesh, those that are buried with him in baptism, those that are conformable to his death, and know the power of his resurrection: those ye persecute, hale before magistrates, and suffer to be beaten
<PB N="373" REF="037441_0450_100D90E8ADE78A88"/>in your synagogues; those ye cause to be whipped and stocked, shamefully entreated, cast into prison, and kept, as many gaols in this nation at this day testify to your sa∣ces. Therefore honestly consider what ye are doing while ye are taking notice of others cruelties, lest ye overlook your own. There is some difference in many things be∣tween the popish religion and that which ye call the pro∣testant, but in this persecution of yours there is no differ∣ence; for ye will confess that the foundation of your reli∣gion is grounded upon the scriptures, yet ye persecute them that are in the same life which they were in who gave forth the scriptures, yourselves being the meanwhile under a profession of the words they spoke: this ye shall one day witness. So ye have a profession and form, and persecute them that are in the possession, life, and power. Know assuredly that ye must come to judgment; for he is made manifest to whom all judgment is committed. To the light of Christ Jesus in your consciences, which searcheth and trieth you, turn your minds; stand still, and wait there to receive the righteous law, which is according to that of God in the conscience, which is now rising and bearing witness against all ungodliness and unrighteous∣ness of men; and they whom ye persecute are manifest to God, and that of God in all consciences shall bear witness for us that we are of God; this ye shall one day witness, whether ye will hear or forbear. Our rejoicing is in the testimony of our consciences, that in simplicity and godly sincerity (not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God) we have had our conversation in the world, not handling the word of God deceitfully, but in the mani∣festation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God; and if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. For witnessing the holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience do we suffer, and are subject for conscience sake. This is thank∣worthy, if a man, for conscience sake, endure griefs and sufferings wrongfully. In this is our joy and rejoicing, having a good conscience, that whereas we are evil spoken of as evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse our good conversation in Christ; which is not only the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This we witness made manifest (eternal praises to the living God!) and bear testimony to that which
<PB N="374" REF="037441_0451_100D90EA42BED1E0"/>spoke it in the apostle in life and power. Therefore do we bear witness and testify against those, who being got into a form and profession of it, do persecute the life and power. To the eternal light of Christ Jesus, the searcher and trier of all hearts, turn your minds, and see what ye are doing; lest ye overturn your foundation, whereon ye pretend to stand, while ye are professing the scriptures, and persecuting the life, light, and power which those were in who gave them forth. For the stone cut out of the mountain without hands is now striking at the feet of the image, the profession which is set up, and stands in the will of man. Now is that made manifest, unto which all must answer, and appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and shall be made manifest in all your consciences, which ye shall witness.</P>

<P>Divers times, both in the time of the long parliament, and of the protector (so called) and of the committee of safety, when they proclaimed fasts, I was moved to write to them, and tell them, their fasts, were like unto Jezebel's: for commonly, when they proclaimed fasts, there was some mischief contrived against us.

<P>Now it was a time of great suffering; and many friends being in prisons, many other friends were moved to go to the parliament, to offer themselves up to lie in the same prisons where their friends lay, that those in prison might go forth, and not perish in the stinking gaols. This we did in love to God and our brethren, that they might not die in prison; and in love to those that cast them in, that they might not bring innocent blood upon their own heads; which we knew would cry to the Lord, and bring his wrath, vengeance, and plagues upon them. But little favour could we find from those professing parliaments; in∣stead thereof, they would rage, and sometimes threaten friends that attended them, to whip, and send them home. Then commonly soon after the Lord would turn them out,
<PB N="375" REF="037441_0452_100D90EBD3D604A8"/>and send them home; who had not an heart to do good in the day of their power. But they went not off without being forewarned; for I was moved to write to them, in their several turns, as I did to the long-parliament, unto whom I declared, before they were broken up, <Q>that thick darkness was coming over them all, even a day of dark∣ness that should be felt.</Q></P>
<P>And because the parliament that now sat was made up mostly of high professors, who, pretending to be more re∣ligious than others, were indeed greater persecutors of those that were truly religious, I was moved to send them the following lines, as a reproof of their hypocrisy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O FRIENDS, do not cloak and cover yourselves: there is a God that knoweth your hearts, and that will uncover you. He seeth your way. <Q>Wo be to him that covereth, but not with my Spirit, saith the Lord.</Q> Do ye act contrary to the law, and then put it from you! Mercy and true judgment ye neglect. Look, what was spoken against such. My Saviour spoke against such; <Q>I was sick, and ye visited me not: I was hungry, and ye fed me not: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: I was in prison, and ye visited me not.</Q> But they said, <Q>When saw we thee in prison, and did not come to thee? Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these little ones, ye did it not unto me.</Q> Friends, ye imprison them that are in the life and power of truth, and yet pro∣fess to be the ministers of Christ; but if Christ had sens you, ye would bring out of prison, out of bondage, and receive strangers. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter; ye have condemned and killed the just, and he doth not resist you.</P>

<P>After this, as I was going out of town, having two friends with me, when we were little more than a mile out of the City, there met us two troopers belonging to colonel Hack∣er's regiment, who took me, and the friends with me, and brought us back to the Mews, and there kept us prisoners a little while; but the Lord's power was so over them, that they did not bring us before any officer; but after awhile set us at liberty. The same day, taking boat, I went to Kingston, and from thence to Hampton Court, to speak
<PB N="376" REF="037441_0453_100D90EEB63C56A0"/>with the Protector about the sufferings of friends. I met him riding into Hampton Court Park; and before I came to him, as he rode at the head of his life-guard, I saw and felt a waft (or apparition) of death go forth against him; and when I came to him, he looked like a dead man. Af∣ter I had laid the sufferings of friends before him, and had warned him, as I was moved to speak to him, he bid me come to his house. So I returned to Kingston, and the next day went to Hampton Court, to have spoken further with him. But when I came, he was sick, and—Har∣vy, who waited on him, told me, The doctors were not willing I should speak with him. So I passed away, and never saw him more.</P>
<P>From Kingston I went to Isaac Penington's, in Buck∣inghamshire, where I had appointed a meeting; and the Lord's truth and power were preciously manifested amongst us. After I had visited friends in those parts, I returned to London; and soon after went into Essex; where I had not been long, before I heard the Protector was dead, and his son Richard made Protector in his room. Whereupon I came to London again.</P>
<P>Before this time the church faith (so called) was given forth, which was said to be made at the Savoy in eleven days. I got a copy of it before it was published, and wrote an answer to it: and when their book of church faith was sold up and down the streets, my answer to it was sold also. This displeased some of the parliament-men; so that one of them told me, 'They must have me to Smithfield.' I told him, I was over their fires, and feared them not. Reasoning with him, I wished him to consider, Had all people been without a faith these sixteen hundred years, that now the priests must make them one? Did not the apostle say that Jesus was the author and finisher of their faith? And since Christ Jesus was the author of the apos∣tles faith, of the church's faith in the primitive times, and of the martyrs faith, should not all people look unto him to be the author and finisher of their faith, and not to the priests? A great deal of work we had about the priests made-faith; for they called us house-creepers, leading silly women captive, because we met in houses, and would not hold up their priests and temples which they had made and set up. I told them, it was they that led silly women cap∣tive, and crept into houses, who kept people always learn∣ing under them, who were covetous, and had got a form
<PB N="377" REF="037441_0454_100D90F0A5641138"/>of godliness, but denied the power and Spirit, which the apostles were in. Such began to creep in the apostles days; but now they had got the magistrates on their side, who upheld those houses for them, which they had crept into, their temples, with their tithes: whereas the apostles brought people off from even that temple, and those tithes and offerings, which God had for a time commanded. And the apostles met in several private houses, being to preach the gospel in all nations; which they did freely, as Christ commanded them. Thus do we, who bring people off from these priests, temples, and tithes (which God never commanded) to meet in houses, or on mountains, as the saints of old did, who were gathered in the name of Jesus; and Christ was their Prophet, Priest and Shepherd.</P>
<P>Major Wiggan, a very envious man, was present, yet he bridled himself before the parliament-men, and some others that were there in company. He took upon him to assert, <Q>Christ had taken away the guilt of sin, but had left the power of sin remaining in us.</Q>I told him, that was strange doctrine; for Christ came to destroy the devil's works, and the power of sin, and so to cleanse men from sin. So major Wiggan's mouth was stopped at that time. But next day desiring to speak with me again, I took a friend or two with me, and went to him. Then he vented a great deal of passion and rage, beyond the bounds of a christian, or moral man; whereupon I was made to reprove him; and having brought the Lord's power over him, and let him see what condition he was in, left him.</P>
<P>After some time I passed out of London, and had a meeting at sergeant Birkhead's at Twickenham, to which many people came; some of considerable quality. A glo∣rious meeting it was, wherein the scriptures were largely and clearly opened, and Christ exalted above all, to the great satisaction of the hearers.</P>
<P>But there was great persecution in many places, both by imprisoning and breaking up of meetings. At a meeting about seven miles from London, the rude people usually came out of several parishes round about, to abuse friends, and often beat and bruised them exceedingly. One day they abused about eighty friends, that went to that meet∣ing out of London, tearing their coats and cloaks from off their backs, throwing them into ditches and ponds; and, when they had besmeared them with dirt, they said they looked like witches. The next first-day I was moved of
<PB N="378" REF="037441_0455_100D90F2344BB5E8"/>the Lord to go to that meeting, though I was then very weak. When I came there, I bid friends bring a table, and set it in the close, where they used to meet, to stand upon. According to their wonted course, the rude people came; and I, having a bible in my hand, shewed them theirs and their teachers fruits; and the people became ashamed, and were quiet. I opened the scriptures to them, and our principles agreeing therewith; and turned them from darkness to the light of Christ and his Spirit, by which they might understand the scriptures, see themselves and their sins, and know Christ Jesus to be their Saviour. So the meeting ended quietly, and the Lord's power came over all, to his glory. But it was a time of great sufferings; for besides imprisonments (through which many died) our meetings were greatly disturbed. They have thrown rotten eggs and wild-fire into our meetings, and brought in drums beating, and kettles, to make noises with, that the truth might not be heard; and, among these, the priests were as rude as any; as may be seen in the book of the fighting priests, wherein a list is given of some priests that had actu∣ally beaten and abused friends.</P>
<P>Many friends were brought prisoners to London, to be tried before the Committee; where Henry Vane, being chairman, would not suffer friends to come in, except they would put off their hats; but at last the Lord's power came over him, so that through the mediation of others, they were admitted. Many of us having been imprisoned upon contempts (as they called them) for not putting off our hats, it was not a likely thing that friends, who had suffered so long for it from others, should put off their hats to him. But the Lord's power came over all, and wrought so, that several were set at liberty by them. Inasmuch as sufferings grew very sharp, I was moved of the Lord to write a few lines, and send among friends, to encourage them to go on faithfully and boldly through the exercises of the day; of which a copy here follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY dear friends every where, in prison or out of pri∣son; Fear not, because of the reports of sufferings; let not the evil spies of the good land make you afraid, if they tell you the walls are high, and Anakims are in the land; for at the blowing of the rams horns did the walls of Jericho fall, and they that brought the evil report perished in the wilderness. Dwell in faith, patience, and
<PB N="379" REF="037441_0456_100D90F3DB43A8F8"/>hope, having the word of life to keep you, which is be∣yond the law; and having the oath of God, his covenant, Christ Jesus, which divides the waters asunder, and makes them to run all on heaps; in that stand, and ye will see all things work together for good to them that love God. In that triumph, when sufferings come, whatever they be. Your faith, your shield, your helmet, your armour you have on. You are ready to skip over a mountain, a wall, or an hill, and to walk through the deep waters, though they be as heaps upon heaps. The evil spies of the good land may preach up hardness; but Caleb, which signifies an heart, and Joshua, a Saviour, triumph over all.</P>

<P>After awhile I went to Reading, where I remained under great sufferings and exercises, and in great travail of spirit for about ten weeks. For I saw there was great confusion and distraction amongst the people, and that the powers were plucking each other to pieces. And I saw how many were destroying the simplicity, and betraying the truth. A great deal of hypocrisy, deceit, and strife, was got upper∣most in the people, so that they were ready to sheath their swords in one another's bowels. There had been tender∣ness in many of them formerly, when they were low; but when they were got up, had killed, and taken possession, they came to be as bad as others: so that we had much to do with them about our hats, and saying Thou and Thee to them. They turned their profession of patience and moderation into rage and madness; many of them were like distracted men for this hat-honour. For they had hard∣ened themselves by persecuting the innocent, and were at this time crucifying the Seed, Christ, both in themselves and others; till at last they fell a biting and devouring one another, until they were consumed one of another; who had turned against and judged that which God had wrought in them, and shewed unto them. So shortly after God overthrew them, turned them upside down, and brought the king over them, who were often surmising that the Quakers met together to bring in king Charles, whereas friends did not concern themselves with the outward powers or government. But at last the Lord brought him in, and many of them, when they saw he would be brought in, voted for the bringing him in. So with heart and voice praise the name of the Lord, to whom it doth belong; who
<PB N="380" REF="037441_0457_100D90F62EC1CD88"/>over all hath the supremacy, and who will rock the nations, for he is over them. I had a sight and sense of the king's return a good while before, and so had some others. I wrote to Oliver several times, and let him know, that while he was persecuting God's people, they whom he accounted his enemies were preparing to come upon him. When some forward spirits, that came amongst us, would have bought Somerset-house, that we might have meetings in it, I forbad them to do so: for I then foresaw the king's com∣ing in again. Besides, there came a woman to me in the Strand, who had a prophecy concerning king Charles's coming in, three years before he came; and she told me, she must go to him to declare it. I advised her to wait upon the Lord, and keep it to herself; for if it should be known that she went on such a message, they would look upon it to be treason; but she said, she must go and tell him, that he should be brought into England again. I saw her prophecy was true, and that a great stroke must come upon those in power: for they that had then got possession were so exceeding high, and such great persecution was acted by them who called themselves saints, that they would take from friends their copyhold lands, because they could not swear in their courts. Sometimes, when we laid these suf∣ferings before Oliver Cromwel, he would not believe it. Wherefore Thomas Aldam and Anthony Pearson were moved to go through all the gaols in England, and to get copies of friends commitments under the gaolers hands, that they might lay the weight of their sufferings upon Oli∣ver Cromwel. And when he refused to give order for the releasing of them, Thomas Aldam was <Q>moved to take his cap off his head, and rend it in pieces before him, and to say unto him, <Q>So shall thy government be rent from thee and thy house.</Q> Another friend also, a woman, was moved to go to the parliament (that was envious against friends) with a pitcher in her hand, which she broke into pieces before them,</Q> and told them, <Q>So should they be broken to pieces:</Q> which came to pass shortly after. And in my great suffering, and travail of spirit for the nation, being grievously burdened with their hypocrisy, treachery, and falsehood, I saw God would bring that atop of them which they had been atop of; and that all must be brought down to that which convinced them, before they could get over that bad spirit within and without: for it is the pure,
<PB N="381" REF="037441_0458_100D90F825779938"/>invisible Spirit, that doth and only can work down all de∣ceit in people.</P>
<P>While I was under that sore travail at Reading, by rea∣son of grief and sorrow of mind, and the great exercise that was upon my spirit, my countenance being altered, and my body become poor and thin; there came a company of un∣clean spirits to me, and told me, <Q>The plagues of God were upon me.</Q> I told them, It was the same spirit spoke in them that said so of Christ, when he was stricken and smitten; they hid their face from him. But when I had travailed with the witness of God, which they had quench∣ed, and had got through with it, over all that hypocrisy which the outside professors were run into, and saw how that would be brought down, and turned under, and that life would rise over it, I came to have ease; and the light, power, and spirit, shined over all. And then, having re∣covered. my body and face swelled, when I came abroad into the air; then the bad spirits said, 'I was grown fat;' and they envied at that also. So I saw that no condition nor state would please that spirit of theirs: but the Lord preserved me by his power and Spirit through and over all; and in the Lord's power I came to London again.</P>
<P>Now was there a great bustle about the effigy of Oliver Cromwel lying in state; men standing and sounding with trumpets over his image, after he was dead. At this my spirit was greatly grieved, and the Lord, I found, was high∣ly offended. Then did I write the following lines, and sent among them, to reprove their wickedness, and warn them to repent.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O FRIENDS, what are ye doing! What mean ye to sound before an image! Will not all sober peo∣ple think ye are like mad people? <Q>Oh, how am I grieved with your abominations! Oh, how am I wea∣ried!

<P>About this time great stirs were in the nation, the minds of people being unsettled. Much plotting and contriving there was by the several factions, to carry on their several interests. And a great care being upon me, lest any young or raw people, that might sometimes come amongst us, should be drawn into that snare, I was moved to give forth the following epistle, as a warning to such:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends every where, keep out of plots and bus∣tling, and the arm of flesh; for all these are amongst Adam's sons in the fall, where they are destroying men's lives like dogs, beasts, and swine, goring, rending, and biting one another, destroying one another, and wrestling with flesh and blood. From whence arise wars and killing, but from the lusts? Now all this is in Adam in the fall, out of Adam that never fell, in whom there is peace and life. Ye are called to peace, therefore follow it; that peace is in Christ, not in Adam in the fall. All that pretend to fight for Christ, are deceived; for his kingdom is not of this world, therefore his servants do not fight. Fighters are not of Christ's kingdom, but are without Christ's king∣dom: for his kingdom stands in peace and righteousness, but fighters are in the lust: and all that would destroy men's lives are not of Christ's mind, who came to save men's lives. Christ's kingdom is not of this world; it is peaceable: and all that are in strife, are not of his king∣dom. All that pretend to fight for the gospel, are deceiv∣ed: for the gospel is the power of God, which was before the devil, or fall of man was: and the gospel of peace was before fighting was. Therefore they that pretend fighting, and talk of sighting so, are ignorant of the gos∣pel. All that talk of fighting for Sion, are in darkness: Sion needs no such helpers. All such as profess them∣selves ministers of Christ, or christians, and go about to beat down the whore with outward, carnal weapons, the flesh and the where are got up in themselves, and they are in a blind zeal: for the whore got up by the inward ra∣vening from the Spirit of God; and the beating down of the whore must be by the inward stroke of the sword of the Spirit within. All such as pretend Christ Jesus, and confess him, yet run into the use of carnal weapons, wrest∣ling
<PB N="383" REF="037441_0460_100D90FBABE51750"/>with flesh and blood, throw away the spiritual wea∣pons. They that would be wrestlers with flesh and blood, throw away Christ's doctrine; the flesh is got upon them, and they are weary of their sufferings. Such as would revenge themselves, are out of Christ's doctrine. Such as being stricken on one cheek, would not turn the other, are out of Christ's doctrine. Such as do not love one another, nor love enemies, are out of Christ's doctrine. Therefore ye, that are heirs of the blessings of God, which were before the curse and the fall was, come to inherit your portions: and ye that are heirs of the gospel of peace, which was before the devil was, live in the gospel of peace, seeking the peace and good of all men: and live in Christ, who came to save men's lives, out of Adam in the fall, where they destroy men's lives, and live not in Christ. The Jews sword outwardly, by which they cut down the heathen, was a type of the Spirit of God within, which cuts down the heathenish nature within. So live in the peaceable kingdom of Christ Jesus. Live in the peace of God, and not in the lusts, from whence wars arise. Live in Christ, the prince of peace, the way of God, the second Adam that never fell. Live not in Adam in the fall, in the destruction, where they destroy one another. Come out of Adam in the fall, into the second Adam that never fell. Live in love and peace with all men; keep out of all the bustlings in the world; meddle not with the powers of the earth; but mind the kingdom, the way of peace. Ye that are heirs of grace, heirs of the kingdom, heirs of the gospel, heirs of salvation, saints of the Most High, and children of God, whose conversation is in heaven, that is above the combustions of the earth; let your conversation preach to all men, and your inno∣cent lives, that those who speak evil of you, beholding your godly conversation, may glorify your Father which is in heaven. Friends every where, this I charge you, which is the word of the Lord God unto you all, <Q>Live in peace, in Christ the way of peace;</Q> therein seek the peace of all men, and no man's hurt. In Adam in the sall is no peace; but in Adam out of the fall is the peace: So ye being in Adam which never fell, it is love that overcomes, not hatred with hatred, nor strife with strife. Therefore live all in the peaceable life, doing good to all men, and seeking the good and welfare of all men.</P>

Not long after this, George Booth rose in arms in Che∣shire, and Lambert went against him. At which time some foolish rash spirits, that came sometimes amongst us, were ready to have taken up arms; but I was moved of the Lord to warn and forbid them, and they were quiet. In the time of the committee of safety (so called) we were invited by them to take up arms, and great places and commands were offered some of us; but we denied them all, and declared against it both by word and writing; testifying, that our weapons and armour were not carnal, but spiritual. And lest any that came amongst us, should be drawn into that snare, it came upon me from the Lord to write a few lines on that occasion, and send them forth, as a caution to all amongst us. Of which this is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends every where, take heed to keep out of the powers of the earth, that run into wars and fightings, which make not for peace, but go from that; such will not have the kingdom. And friends, take heed of joining with this or the other, or meddling with any, or being busy with other men's matters; but mind the Lord, his power, and his service. Let friends keep out of other men's matters, and keep in that which answers the witness in them all, out of the man's matters part, where they must expect wars, and the dishonour. Friends every where, dwell in your own, in the power of the Lord, to keep your minds up to God, from falling down to the strength of Egypt, or going thither for strength, after ye are come out of it, like the children of Israel, after they were come out of outward Egypt. But dwell in the power of the Lord God, that ye may keep over all the powers of the earth, amongst whom the just hand of God is come: for they have turned against the just, and disobeyed the just in their own particulars, and so gone on in one against the just; therefore the just sets them one against another. Now he that goes to help among them, is from the just in himself, in the mad and unstayed state, and doth not know by the All-seeing eye (that beholdeth) him that re∣compenseth and rewardeth, and lives not in the hand, in the power that mangles and overturns, which vexeth the transgressors, that come to be blind and zealous for they do not know what. Therefore keep in peace, and in the love and power of God, and in unity and love one to ano∣ther, lest any go out, and fall with the uncircumcised;
<PB N="385" REF="037441_0462_100D91006CBAE5B0"/>that is, they that are from the Spirit in themselves, and they that go from it, go into the pit together. Therefore stand in that (it is the word of the Lord God to you all) in the fear and dread of the Lord God, his power, life, light, seed and wisdom, by which ye may take away the occasion of wars, and so know a kingdom which hath no end, and fight for that with spiritual weapons, which takes away the occasion of the carnal: and there gather men to war, as many as ye can, and set up as many as ye can with these weapons.</P>

<P>After I had staid some time in London, and had visited friends meetings there and thereabouts, and the Lord's power was set over all, I travelled into the counties again, passing through Suffolk, Essex, and Norfolk, visiting friends, till I came to Norwich, where we had a meeting about the time called Christmas. The mayor of Norwich, having got notice beforehand of the meeting I intended to have there, granted a warrant to apprehend me. Wherefore when I was come thither, and heard of the warrant, I sent some friends to the mayer to reason with him about it. His answer was, the soldiers should not meet; and did we think to meet? he would have had us met without the city: for he said, the town's-people were so rude, that he could hardly order them, and he feared that our meeting would make tumults in the town. But our friends told him, we were a peaceable people, and that he ought to keep the peace; for we could not but meet to worship God, as our manner was. So he became pretty moderate, and did not send his officers to the meeting. A large meeting it was, and abundance of rude people came, with intent to have done mischief: but the Lord's power came over them, so that they were chained by it, though several priests were there, and professors, and Ranters. Among the priests, one, whose name was Townsend, stood up and cried, Error, blasphemy, and an ungodly meeting! I bad him not burden himself with that which he could not make good; and I asked him, what was our error and blasphemy? for I told him, he should make good his words, before I had done with him, or be shamed. As for an ungodly meeting, I said, I did believe there were many people there that feared God, and therefore it was both unchristian and uncivil in him, to charge civil godly people with an ungodly meeting. He said,
<PB N="386" REF="037441_0463_100D910200865A88"/>My error and blasphemy was, in that I said, people must wait on God by his power and Spirit, and feel his presence, when they did not speak words: I asked him then, Whe∣ther the apostles and holy men of God did not hear God speak to them in their silence, before they spake forth the Scripture, and before it was written? He replied, Yes: David and the prophets did hear God, before they did pen the scriptures, and felt his presence in silence, before they spake them forth. Then said I, All people take notice, he said this was error and blasphemy in me to say these words; and now he hath confessed it is not more than the holy men of God in former times witnessed. So I shewed the people, that as the holy men of God, who gave forth the Scriptures, were moved by the Holy Ghost, did hear and learn of God, before they spake them forth, so must they all heark∣en and hear what the Spirit saith, which will lead them into all truth, that they may know God and Christ, and may understand the Scriptures. O, said the priest, this is not that George Fox I would speak withal; this is a subtil man, said he. So the Lord's power came over all, the rude peo∣ple were moderate, and were reached by it; and some pro∣fessors called to the priests, saying, <Q>Prove the blasphe∣my and errors, which ye have charged them with: ye have spoken much against them behind their backs, but nothing ye can prove now to their faces.</Q> But the priest began to get away: whereupon I told him, we had many things to charge him withal, therefore let him set a time and place to answer them; which he did and went his way. A glorious day this was: for truth came over all, and people were turned to God by his power and Spirit, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, their free teacher, who was exalted over all. And as we passed away, generally people's hearts were filled with love towards us; yea, the ruder sort of them de∣sired another meeting: for the evil intentions they had against us were thrown out of their hearts. At night I pas∣sed out of town to a friend's house, and from thence to colo∣nel Dennis's, where we had a great meeting: and afterwards travelled on, visiting friends up and down in Norfolk, Hunt∣ingtonshire, and Cambridgeshire. But George Whitehead, and Richard Hubberthorn staid about Norwich, to meet the priest, who was soon confounded and down, the Lord's power came so over him.</P>
<P>After I had travelled through many counties in the Lord's service, and many were convinced, notwithstanding
<PB N="387" REF="037441_0464_100D9103D172B0A8"/>that in some places the people were very rude, I returned to London again, when general Monk was come up thither, and the gates and posts of the city were pulling down. <Q>Long before this I had a vision, wherein I saw the city lie in heaps, and the gates down; and it was then repre∣sented to me, just as I saw it several years after, lying in heaps when it was burned.</Q></P>

<P>FRIENDS, Now are the prophecies fulfilled and ful∣filling upon you, which have been spoken to you by the people of God in your courts, in your steeple-houses, in your towns, cities, markets, highways, and at your feasts, when ye were in your pleasures, and puffed up, that ye would neither hear God nor man; when ye were in your height of authority, though raised up from a mean state, none might come nigh you without bow∣ing, or the respect of persons, for ye were in the world's way, compliments and fashions, which for conscience sake towards God, they could not go into, being redeemed therefrom: therefore they were hated by you for that cause. But how are ye brought low, who exalted yourselves above your brethren, and threw the just and harmless from among you, until at last God hath thrown you out: and when ye cast the innocent from amongst you, then ye fell a biting one another, until ye were consumed one of another. And so the day is come upon you, which be∣fore was told to you, though ye would not believe it. And are not your hearts so hardened, that ye will hardly yet believe, though ready to go into captivity? was it not told you, when ye spilt the blood of the innocent in your stee∣ple-houses, in your markets, in your highways and cities, yea, and even in your courts also, because they said the word Thou to you, and could not put off their hats to you, <Q>That if something did not rise up amongst yourselves, to avenge the blood of the innocent, there would come something from beyond the seas, which lay reserved there; which being brought by the arin of God, the arm of flesh
<PB N="388" REF="037441_0465_100D9106914E38B8"/>and strongest mountain cannot withstand?</Q> Yet ye would not consider, nor regard, nor hear; but cried, peace, peace, and feasted yourselves, and sat down in the spoil of your enemies, being treacherous both to God and man; and who will trust you now? have ye not ta∣ken covenants and oaths? and broken covenants and oaths betwixt God and man, and made the nations breakers both of covenants and oaths; so that nothing but hypo∣crisy, and rottenness, and falsehood under fair pretence, was amongst you? When ye pretended to set up the old cause, it was but yourselves; for which ye long stunk to sober people, who saw that ye would do no good. But it was a joy for any of you to get up into authority, that ye might have praise, and honour, and respect; and they that were in the self-denial were a derision to you; from amongst whom that was banished. Thus ye became the nations masters, and not servants; whereas the greatest of all should be the servants of all. But there ye lost your authority, not considering your estates, from whence ye were, and to what end God had raised you up; but for∣got the Lord, and quenched that which was good in your∣selves, and persecuted them that lived in it: and so are grown so gross and perverse, that at last ye are fit for neither God nor man. Have not ye used to call the Qua∣kers the fanatic people, and the giddy heads? but whither now are ye giddying? into Cain's city Nod, which signi∣fies fugitive, or wandering? Have not ye persecuted and imprisoned to death, such as God had respect to, and is now reproving you for their sakes, by them whom ye have hated? Were not many amongst you cut off for your persecution, and yet the rest of you would not take warn∣ing? Was not there a book of examples set out unto you, of what sudden and strange deaths happened upon the persecutors of the innocent? and yet ye would not take warning, until the overflowing scourge is now coming upon you. Are not ye they that have killed like Cain, who have killed about your sacrifice, and mingled the blood of the innocent with it? Hath not God now vagabonded you, that ye should become a curse upon the earth, who have persecuted friends to death? Did not the blood of the righteous cry out of the ground for vengeance? And will not the blood of the righteous be required? Could ye think, that the Lord would sit always with bloody hands, and fists of wickedness! Ah! What's become of

<P>Being now clear of the city, and finding my spirit drawn to visit friends in the western parts of England, I went out of town; and passing first into Surry and Sussex, came to a great town, where there was a large meeting, to which several frieds from Reading came; and a blessed meeting it was. The priest of the town was in a great rage, but did not come out of his house, wherefore, hearing him make a great noise in his house, as we were passing from the meet∣ing, we bid him come out into the street, and we would dis∣course with him; but he would not. So the Lord's power being over all, friends were refreshed therein. From thence I went to another market-town, where in the evening we had a precious meeting; and the fresh sense of the presence of the Lord God was sweetly felt amongst us. Then turn∣ing into Hampshire and Dorsetshire, I went to Ringwood and Pool, visiting friends in the Lord's power, and had great meetings amongst them.</P>
<P>At Dorchester we had a great meeting in the evening at our inn, to which many soldiers came, and were pretty civil. But the constables and officers of the town came, under pretence to look for a Jesuit, whose head (they said) was shaved: and they would have all to put off their hats, or else they would take them off, to look for the Jesuit's shaven crown. So they took off my hat (for I was the man they aimed at) and they looked very narrowly; but not finding any bald or shaven place on my head, they went away with shame; and the soldiers, and other sober people were greatly offended with them. But it was of good ser∣vice for the Lord, and all things wrought together for good; for it affected the people: and after the officers were gone, we had a fine meeting; and people were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, their teacher, who had bought them, and would reconcile them to God.</P>
<P>From thence we passed into Somersetshire, where the presbyterians and other professors were very wicked, and often disturbed friends meetings. <Q>One time especially (as we were then informed) a very wicked man put a bear's skin on his back, and undertook with that to play pranks in the meeting. Accordingly, setting himself opposite to the friend that was speaking, he lolled his tongue out of
<PB N="390" REF="037441_0467_100D910A10B60F98"/>his mouth, and made sport to his wicked followers, causing great disturbance in the meeting. But an eminent judg∣ment overtook him, and his punishment slumbered not; for as he went from the meeting there was a bull-baiting in the way, which he stayed to see; and coming within the bull's reach, he struck h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn under the man's chin into his throat, and thrast his tongue out of his mouth, so that it hung lolling out, as he had used it before in derision in the meeting. And the bull's horn running up into the man's head, he swung him about upon his horn in a most remarkable and fearful manner. Thus he that came to do mischief amongst God's people was mischieved himself; and well would it be if such apparent examples of divine vengeance would teach others to beware.</Q></P>
<P>We travelled through Somersetshire and Devonshire, till we came to Plymouth, and so into Cornwall, visiting the meetings of friends, to the Land's-end. Many precious and blessed meetings we had all along as we went, wherein the convinced were established, and many others were added to them. At the Land's-end an honest fisherman was convin∣ced, who became a faithful minister of Christ. I took no∣tice of him to friends, telling them, 'He was like Peter.'</P>
<P>While I was in Cornwall, there were great shipwrecks about the Land's-end. It was the custom of that country at such a time, both rich and poor went out to get as much of the wreck as they could, not caring to save the people's lives; and in some parts of the country they called ship∣wrecks God's grace. It grieved my spirit to hear of such un∣christian actions, considering how far they were below the heathen at Melita, who received Paul, made him a fire, and were courteous towards him, and those that suffered shipwreck with him. Wherefore I was moved to write a paper, and send it to all the parishes, priests, and magis∣trates, to reprove them for such greedy actions, and to warn and exhort them that, if they could assist to save people's lives and preserve their ships and goods, they should use their diligence therein; and consider, if it had been their own condition, they would judge it hard, if they should be upon a wreck and the people should strive to get what they could from them, and not regard their lives.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and people,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKE heed of greediness and covetousness, for that is idolatry; and the idolater must not enter into the
<PB N="391" REF="037441_0468_100D910BCAC20358"/>kingdom of God. Take heed of drunkenness, oaths, and cursings, for such are destroyers of the creation, and make it to groan. Lay aside all fighting, quarrelling, brawling, and evil-speaking, which are the works of the flesh and not of the Spirit, for who follow such things are not like to inherit the kingdom of God. Put away all corrupt words, which are unsavoury, and misnaming one another, for ye must give an account for every idle word. Lay aside all profession and religion that is vain, and come to the possession, the pure religion, which is to visit the fa∣therless, the widow, and the stranger, and receive them, for some thereby may entertain angels or the servants of the Lord unawares, as Paul was entertained after the ship∣wreck at Melita. Do not take people's-goods from them by force out of their ships, seamen's or others, neither covet after them; but rather endeavour to preserve their lives and goods for them, for that shews a spirit of com∣passion, and the spirit of a christian. But if ye be greedy and covetous after other men's goods, not mattering what becomes of the men, would ye be served so yourselves? If ye should have a ship cast away in other places, and the people should come to tear the goods and ship in pieces, not regarding to save your lives, but be ready to fight one with another for your goods, do not ye believe such goods would become a curse to them? May ye not as surely be∣lieve such kind of actions will become a curse to you? When the spoil of one ship's goods is idly spent and consu∣med upon the lusts in alehouses, taverns, and otherwise, then ye gape for another. Is this to <Q>do as ye would be done by;</Q> which is the law and the prophets? Priest Hull, are these thy fruits? What dost thou take people's labour and goods for? Hast thou taught the people no better man∣ners and conversation, who are so brutish and heathenish? All such things we judge in whomsoever. But if any friend or others preserve men's lives, and endeavour to save their goods and estates, and restore what they can save of a wreck to the owners, if they consider them for their labour, doing in that case unto them what they would have done to themselves, that we approve. And if they buy or sell, and do not make a prey, that is al∣lowed of still in the way of <Q>doing as ye would be done by,</Q> keeping to the law and to the prophets. If you should be wrecked in another country, ye would have other people save your lives and goods, and have your
<PB N="392" REF="037441_0469_100D910E4F864610"/>goods restored to you again, and you ought to consider them for so doing. All that do otherwise, who wait for a wreck and take the goods for yourselves, not regarding the lives of the men, but if any escape drowning turn them a begging up and down the country, and if any escape with a little rob them of it, all that do so are not for preserving the creation, but destroying it: and those goods which are so got shall be a curse, a plague, and a judgment to them, and the judgments of God will follow them for act∣ing such things; the witness in your consciences shall an∣swer it. Therefore, all ye who have done such things, "do so no more," lest a worse thing come unto you. But that which is good, do: preserve men's lives and estates, and labour to restore the loss and breach: that the Lord requires. Be not like a company of greedy dogs, and worse than heathens, as if ye had never heard of God, nor Christ, nor the scriptures, nor pure religion. And priest Hull, have people spent their money upon thee for that which is no bread? for a thing of nought, that thou hast such fruits? All such teachers, that make a trade of the scriptures (which are given forth from the Spirit of God, to be believed, read, and practised, and Christ, whom they testify of, enjoyed) we utterly deny; who own Christ, and are come off from your steeple-houses, which were the old mass-houses; for there are these bad fruits harboured, those are the cages of them. But come to the church which is in God (1 Thess. i.) and come all to the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened you with, which shews you all your ungodly words, ungodly thoughts, and ungodly actions. This will be your teacher if ye love it, your condemner if ye hate it. For the mighty day of the Lord is coming upon all wickedness and ungodliness; therefore lay aside your whoredoms and fornications. And ye magistrates, who are to do justice, think ye not that the hand of the Lord is against you, and that his judgments will come upon you who do not look after these things, and stop them with the law, which is, <Q>To do unto all men as they would have done unto them,</Q> whereby ye might be a good savour in your country? Is not the law to pre∣serve men's lives and estates, <Q>Doing unto all men as they would men should do unto them?</Q> For all men would have their lives and estates preserved; therefore, should not ye preserve others, and not suffer them to be
<PB N="393" REF="037441_0470_100D911096D4FC68"/>devoured and destroyed? The evil of these things will lie upon you, both priests and magistrates.</P>

<P>This paper had good service among people: and friends have endeavoured much to save the lives of men in time of wrecks, and to preserve the ships and goods for them. And when some, who suffered shipwreck, have been almost-dead and starved, friends have taken them to their houses to suc∣cour and recover them, which is an act to be practised by all true christians.</P>
<P>I had many precious, blessed, living meetings in Corn∣wall, several eminent people being convinced in that coun∣ty, whom neither priests nor magistrates, by spoiling goods or imprisonments, could bring to forsake their shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ, who bought them; and friends who were turned to Christ, their Teacher and Saviour, being settled in peace and quietness upon him, their Foundation, we left them to the Lord's teaching and ordering, fresh and green. Thomas Lower, who had accompanied me through that county, brought me over Horse-bridge into Devonshire again; and after several meetings in Devonshire we came to Somersetshire, where we had divers large and peaceable meetings, and visited friends till we came to Bristol.</P>
<P>I entered Bristol on a seventh-day. The day before the soldiers came into the meeting, and were exceeding rude, beating and striking friends with their muskets, and drove them out of the orchard in a great rage, threatening what they would do if they came there again. For the mayor and the commander of the soldiers had, if seems, combined together to make a disturbance amongst us. When friends told me what a rage there was in the town, how they were threatened by the mayor and soldiers, and how unruly they
<PB N="394" REF="037441_0471_100D9112285C7D30"/>had been the day before, I sent for George Bishop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed, and Edward Pyot, and desired them to go to the mayor and aldermen, and request them, seeing they had broke up our meetings, to let us have the town-hall to meet in; and for the use of it we would give them twenty pounds a year, to be distributed amongst the poor: and when the mayor and aldermen had business to do in it, friends would not meet in it, but only on the first-days. Those friends were astonished at this, and said, The mayor and aldermen would think they were mad. I said, Nay; for they should offer them a considerable benefit to the poor. And it was upon me from the Lord to bid them go. At last they consented, and went, though in the cross to their own wills. When they had laid the thing before the mayor, it came so over him, that he said. <Q>For his part he could consent to it, but he was but one.</Q> He told them of another great hall they might have, but that they did not accept of, it being inconvenient. So they came away, leaving the mayor in a very loving frame towards them; for they felt the Lord's power had come over him. When they came back, I spoke to them to go to the colo∣nel, and lay before him the rude carriage of his soldiers, how they came armed amongst naked innocent people, who were waiting upon and worshipping the Lord; but they were backward to go to him. Next morning, being first-day, we went to the meeting in the Orchard, where the sol∣diers had so lately been so rude. After I had declared the truth a pretty while in the meeting, there came in many rude soldiers and people, some with drawn swords. The innkeepers had made some of them drunk; and one of them had bound himself with an oath, <Q>to cut down and kill the man that spoke.</Q> He came pressing in through the crowd to within two yards of me, and stopped at those four friends before-mentioned (who should have gone to the colonel as I would have had them) and fell a jangling with them. On a sudden I saw his sword was put up and gone; for the Lord's power came over all, and chained him with the rest. We had a blessed meeting, for the Lord's everlasting power and presence was felt amongst us. The day follow∣ing those four friends went and spoke with the colonel, and he sent for the soldiers, and cut and slashed some of them before the friends faces. Which when I heard of I blamed them for letting him do so, and also for not going on the seventh-day as I would have had them. Which might have
<PB N="395" REF="037441_0472_100D7F74417BB320"/>prevented this cutting of the soldiers, and the trouble they gave at our meeting. Thus the Lord's power came over all those persecuting, bloody minds, and the meeting was held in peace for a good while after.</P>
<P>I had then also a general meeting at Edward Pyot's near Bristol, at which it was judged were several thousands of people; for besides friends from many parts thereabouts, some of the Baptists and Independents, with their teachers, came to it, and many of the sober people of Bristol; in∣somuch that the people who staid behind said, <Q>The city looked naked.</Q> so many were gone out of it to this meet∣ing. It was very quiet, many glorious truths were opened to the people, and the Lord Jesus Christ was set up, who is the end of all figures and shadows, of the law and the first covenant. It was declared to the people, that all figures and shadows were given to man after man fell, and that all the rudiments and inventions of men which have been set up in Christendom, many of which were Jewish and heathenish, were not set up by the command of Christ; and all images and likenesses man has made to himself or for himself, whether of things in heaven or things in earth, have been since he lost the image and likeness of God, which God made him in. But now Christ is come to redeem, translate, convert, and regenerate man out of all these things that he hath set up in the fall, out of the true types, figures and shadows also, and out of death and darkness, up into the light, life, and image of God again, which man and woman were in before they fell. Therefore all now should come, and all may come to receive Christ Jesus, the sub∣stance, by his light, spirit, grace and faith, and should live and walk in him, the Redeemer and Saviour.</P>
<P>And as we had a great deal of work with priests and pro∣fessors, who pleaded for imperfection, I was opened to de∣clare and manifest to them that Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell, and all that God made he saw was good, and he blessed it; but the imperfection came in by the fall, through man's and woman's hearkening to the devil who was out of truth. And though the law made nothing perfect, yet it made way for the bringing in of the better hope, which hope is Christ, who destroys the devil and his works, which made man and woman imperfect. Christ saith to his disci∣ples, <Q>Be ye perfect, even as your heavenly Father is per∣fect:</Q> and he, who himself was perfect, comes to make man and woman perfect again and brings them again to the
<PB N="396" REF="037441_0473_100D9116754B8248"/>state which God made them in. So he is the maker up of the breach, and the peace betwixt God and man. That this might the better be understood by the lowest capacities, I used a comparison of two old people who had their house broken down by an enemy, so that they, with all their chil∣dren, were liable to all storms and tempests. And there came some to them that pretended to be workmen, and of∣fered to build up their house again, if they would give them so much a year; but when they had got their money they left their house as they found it. After this manner came a second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, each with his seve∣ral pretence to build up the old house, and each got the people's money, and then cried, <Q>They could not rear up the house, the breach could not be made up; for there is no perfection here.</Q> They tell them, the house can never be perfectly built up again in this life, though they have taken the people's money for doing it. For all the sect∣masters in christendom (so called) have pretended to build up Adam's and Eve's fallen house, and when they have got people's money, tell them the work cannot be perfectly done here; so their house lies as it did. But I told the people, Christ was come to do it freely, who by one offer∣ing hath perfected for ever all them that are sanctified, and renews them up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, and makes man's and woman's house as perfect again as God made them at the first; and this Christ, the heavenly Man, doth freely. Therefore all are to look unto him, and all that have re∣ceived him are to walk in him, the Life, the Substance, the First, and the Last, <Q>The Rock of Ages, the Founda∣tion of many Generations.</Q> Largely were these and ma∣ny other things opened to people, the word of life was preached, which lives and abides, and all were exhorted to hear and obey it, that by it all might be born again of the immortal seed, and feed of the milk of the word. A glo∣rious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's everlasting seed, Christ Jesus, was set over all, and friends parted in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in peace, and in his truth, that is over all.</P>
<P>About this time the soldiers under general Monk's com∣mand were rude and troublesome at friends meetings in many places, whereof complaint being made to him, he gave forth the following order, which somewhat restrained them:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After this meeting, I passed to Oldeston, to Nailsworth, and to Nathaniel Crisp's; where was a large meeting, and several soldiers, but quiet. From thence we passed to Gloucester, visiting meetings. In Gloucester we had one that was peaceable, though the town was very rude and divided; for one part of the soldiers were for the king, and another for the parliament. As I passed out of the town over the bridge, Edward Pyot being with me, the soldiers there said, 'They were for the king.' After we were past them, they were in a great rage that I had escaped them, and said, <Q>Had they known it they would have shot me with hail-shot rather than I should have escaped.</Q> But the Lord prevented their devilish design, and brought me safe to colonel Grimes's, where we had a large general meeting, and the Lord's truth and power was set over all; friends were established upon the Rock, and settled under the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching.</P>
<P>We passed from thence to Tewksbury, and so to Wor∣cester, visiting meetings as we went. And in all my time I never saw the like drunkenness as then in the towns; for they had been choosing parliament-men. At Worcester the Lord's truth was set over all, people were finely settled therein, and friends praised the Lord; nay, I saw the very earth rejoiced. Yet great fears and troubles were in many, looking for the king's coming in, and that all things should be altered. They would ask me what I thought of times and things? I told them the Lord's power was over all, his light shined over all, and that fear would take hold only on the hypocrites, such as had not been faithful to God, and on our persecutors. In my travail and sufferings at Reading, when people were at a stand, and could not tell who might rule, I told them the Lord's power was over all (for I travelled through in it) and his day shined whosoever should come in, and whether the king came in or no, all would be well to them that loved the Lord, and were faith∣ful
<PB N="398" REF="037441_0475_100D9119F363A7A8"/>to him. Therefore I bid all friends fear none but the Lord, and keep in his power that was over all.</P>
<P>From Worcester I visited friends meetings till I came to Badgely; from thence I went to Drayton, in Leicestershire, to visit my relations. While I was there, one Burton, a justice, hearing I had a good horse, sent a warrant to search for me and my horse; but I was gone before they came, so he missed of his wicked end. I passed to Twycross, Swan∣ington, and Derby, where I visited friends, and found my old gaoler amongst them, who had formerly kept me in the house of correction there, who was now convinced of the truth which I then suffered under him for. Passing into Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, I came to Synderhill∣green, visiting friends meetings; and so to Balby in York∣shire, where our yearly meeting at that time was held, in a great orchard of John Killam's, where it was supposed some thousands of people and friends were gathered together. In the morning I heard a troop of horse was sent from York, about thirty miles off, to break up our meeting, and that the militia newly raised was to join them. I went into the meeting, and stood up on a great stool; and after I had spoken some time, two trumpeters came, sounding their trumpets pretty near me, and the captain of the troop cried, 'Divide to the right and left, and make way.' Then they rode up to me. I was declaring the everlasting truth and word of life, in the mighty power of the Lord. The captain bid me <Q>Come down, for he was come to disperse our meeting.</Q> After some time I told him, they all knew we were a peaceable people, and that we used to have such great meetings; but if he apprehended we met in an hostile way, I desired him to make search among us, and if he found either sword or pistol about any there, let such suffer. He told me, <Q>He must see us dispersed, for he came all night on purpose to disperse us.</Q> I asked him, What honour it would be to him to ride with swords and pistols amongst so m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny unarmed men and women as there were? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he would be still and quiet, our meeting probably might not continue above two or three hours, and when it was done, as we came peaceably together, so we should part; for he might perceive the meeting was so large all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abouts could not entertam them, but that they in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d to dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> towards their homes at night. He said, <Q>He could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to see the meeting ended, but must dis∣perse them before he went.</Q> I desired him then, if he
<PB N="399" REF="037441_0476_100D911B8813A468"/>himself could not stay, that he would let a dozen of his soldiers stay, and see the order and peaceableness of our meeting. He said, 'He would permit us an hour's time,' and left half a dozen soldiers with us. Then he went away with his troop, and friends of the house gave the soldiers that staid, and their horses, some meat. When the captain was gone, the soldiers that were left told us, <Q>We might stay till night if we would.</Q> But we staid but about three hours after, and had a glorious, powerful meeting; for the presence of the living God was manifest amongst us, and the seed, Christ, was set over all. Friends were built upon him the foundation, and settled under his glorious, heaven∣ly teaching. After the meeting friends passed away in peace, greatly refreshed with the presence of the Lord, and filled with joy and gladness that the Lord's power had given them such dominion. Many of the militia-soldiers staid also, much vexed that the captain and troopers had not broke up our meeting, and cursed the captain and his troopers. It was reported they intended evil against us that day; but the troopers, instead of assisting them, were rather assistant to us, in not joining them as they expected, but prevent∣ing them from doing the mischief they designed. Yet this captain was a desperate man; for it was he that said to me in Scotland, <Q>He would obey his superior's commands, if it was to crucify Christ he would do it, or execute the great Turk's commands against the christians if he was under him.</Q> So that it was an eminent power of the Lord, which chained both him and his troopers, and those envious militia-soldiers also, who went away, not having power to hurt any of us, nor to break up our meeting.</P>
<P>Next day we had an heavenly meeting at Warmsworth of friends in the ministry, with several others; and then friends parted. As they passed through the country several were taken up; for the day that our first meeting was held on, Lambert was routed, and it made great confusion in the country; but friends were not kept long in prison at that time. As I went to this meeting there came several to me at Skegby in Nottinghamshire, who were going to be sol∣diers under Lambert, and would have bought my horse of me; and because I would not sell him, they were in a great rage against me, using many threatening words: but I told them, 'God would confound and scatter them;' and within two or three days after they were scattered indeed.</P>
<P>From Warmsworth I passed, in the Lord's power, to
<PB N="400" REF="037441_0477_100D911E07FB26E0"/>Barton-abby, where I had a great meeting; from thence to Thomas Taylor's, and so to Skipton, where was a gene∣ral meeting of men friends out of many counties concerning the affairs of the church. <Q>A friend went naked through the town, declaring truth, and was much beaten. Some other friends also came to me all bloody.</Q> As I wakled in the street, a desperate fellow had an intent to have done me mischief; but he was prevented, and our meeting was qui∣et. To this meeting came many friends out of most parts of the nation; for it was about business relating to the church both in this nation and beyond the seas. Several years before, when I was in the north, I was moved to recommend to friends the setting up of this meeting for that service; for many friends suffered in divers parts of the nation, their goods were taken from them contrary to law, and they understood not how to help themselves, or where to seek redress. But after this meeting was set up, several friends who had been magistrates, and others who under∣stood something of the law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e thither, and were able to inform friends, and to assist them in gathering up the suffer∣ings, that they might be laid before the justices, judges, or parliament. This meeting had stood several years, and divers justices and captains had come to break it up, but when they understood the business friends met about, and saw friends books, and accounts of collections for relief of the poor, how we took care one county to help another, and to help our friends beyond sea, and provide for our poor that none of them should be chargeable to their pa∣rishes, &amp;c. the justlices and officers confessed that we did their work, and would pass away peaceably and lovingly, 'commending friends practice.' Sometimes there would come two hundred of the poor of other people, and wait till the meeting was done (for all the country knew we met about the poor) and after the meeting friends would send to the bakers for bread, and give every one of those poor people a loaf, how many soever there were of them; for we were taught <Q>to do good unto all, though especially to the household of saith.</Q></P>
<P>After this meeting, I visited friends meeting till I came to Lancaster; from whence I went to Robert Withers's, and so to Arnside, where I had a general meeting for all the friends in the counties of Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancashire. This meeting was quiet and peaceable, and the living presence of the Lord was amongst us. I went
<PB N="401" REF="037441_0478_100D91204D96FD18"/>back with Robert Withers, and friends passed away, fresh in the life and power of Christ, in which they had domi∣nion, being settled upon him the Heavenly Rock and Foun∣dation. Several rude fellows, serving-men belonging to Sir George Middleton, a justice, that lived not far off, came to have made some disturbance, as it was thought; but the meeting being ended they did nothing there: but lighting on three women friends going homeward, they set upon them with impudent scoffs, and one of them carried him∣self very abusively and immodestly towards them. The same man abused other friends also, and was so outrageous that he would have cut some with an ax, but that the was restrained by some of his fellows. At another time the same man set upon six friends that were going to a meeting at Yelland, and beat and abused them so, that he <Q>bruised their faces and shed much of their blood,</Q> wounding them very sore, and one of them in several parts of his body; yet they lifted not an hand against him, but gave him their backs and cheeks to beat.</P>
<P>From Robert Withers's I went next day to Swarthmore, Francis Howgil and Thomas Curtis being with me. I had not been long there before Henry Porter, a justice, sent a warrant by the chief constable and three petty constables to apprehend me. I had a sense of the thing beforehand; and being in the parlour with Richard Richardson and Marga∣ret Fell, some of her servants came and told her, there were some come to search the house for arms, and they went up into some of the chambers under that pretence. It came upon me to go out to them, and as I was going by some of them, I spoke to them; whereupon they asked me my name. I readily told them my name, and they laid hold on me, saying, I was the man they looked for, and led me away to Ulverstone. There they kept me all night at the constable's, and set a guard of fisteen or sixteen men to watch me; some of whom sate in the chimney, for fear I should go up the chimney: such dark imaginations possessed them. They were very rude and uncivil to me, and would neither suffer me to speak to friends nor friends to bring me necessaries; but with violence thrust them out, and kept a strong guard upon me. Very wicked and rude they were, and a great noise they made about me. One of the consta∣bles, whose name was Ashburnham, said, <Q>He did not think a thousand men could have taken me.</Q> Another of the constables, whose name was Mount, a very wicked man,
<PB N="402" REF="037441_0479_100D91580565D600"/>said, <Q>He would have served judge Fell himself so, if he had been alive, and he had a warrant for him.</Q> Next morning, about the sixth hour, I was putting on my boots and spurs to go with them before some justice; but they pulled off my spurs, took my knife out of my pocket, and hasted me away along the town, with a party of horse and abundance of people, not suffering me to stay till my own horse came down. When I was gone about a quarter of a mile with them, some friends, with Margaret Fell and her children, came towards me, and then a great party of horse gathered about me in a mad rage and fury, crying out, 'Will they rescue him! will they rescue him!' Where∣upon I said, <Q>Here is my hair, here is my back, here are my cheeks, strike on!</Q> Upon which their heat was a little assuaged. Then they brought a little horse, and two of them took up one of my legs, and put my foot in the stir∣rup, and two or three lifting over my other leg, set me upon the little horse, behind the saddle, and so led the horse by the halter, but I had nothing to hold by. When they were come a pretty way out of the town, they beat the little horse, and made him kick and gallop; whereupon I slipped off him, and told them, <Q>They should not abuse the creature.</Q> They were much enraged at my getting off, and took me by the legs and feet, and set me upon the same horse behind the saddle again, and led the horse about two miles, till we came to a great water called Carter-ford. By this time my own horse was come to us, and the water being deep, and their little horse scarce able to carry me through, they let me get upon my own horse through the persuasion of some of their own company, they leading him through the water. One wicked fellow <Q>kneeled down, and lifting up his hands blessed God that I was taken.</Q> When I was come over the sands, I told them I had heard I had liberty to choose what justice I would go before; but the constables cried, 'No, I should not.' They led me to Lancaster, about fourteen miles, and a great triumph they thought to have had; but as they led me I was moved to <Q>sing praises to the Lord, in his triumphing power over all.</Q> When I was come to Lancaster, the spirits of the people being mightily up, I stood and looked earnestly upon them, and they cried, 'Look at his eyes!' After a while I spoke to them, and they were pretty sober. Then came a young man who took me to his house, and after a little time the officers had me to major Porter's, the justice
<PB N="403" REF="037441_0480_100D7F8F85999800"/>who had sent the warrant against me, who had several others with him. When I came in, I said, <Q>Peace be amongst you.</Q> Porter asked me, <Q>Why I came into the country that troublesome time?</Q> I told him, 'To visit my bre∣thren.' But said he, <Q>You have great meetings up and down.</Q> I told him though we had, our meetings were known throughout the nation to be peaceable, and we were a peaceable people. He said, <Q>We saw the devil in peo∣ple's faces.</Q> I told him, <Q>If I saw a drunkard, or a swear∣er, or a peevish heady man, J could not say I saw the Spirit of God in him.</Q> And I asked him, <Q>If he could see the Spirit of God?</Q> He said, <Q>We cried against their ministers.</Q> I told him, While we were as Saul, sitting under the priests, and running up and down with their packets of letters, we were never called pestilent fellows nor makers of sects; but when we were come to exercise our consciences towards God and man, we were called pestilent fellows, as Paul was. He said, We could express ourselves well enough, and he would not dispute with me; but he would restrain me. I desired to know, <Q>for what, and by whose order he sent his warrant for me;</Q> and complained to him of the abuse of the constables and other officers after they had taken me, and in their bringing me thither. He would not take notice of that, but told me, <Q>He had an orden but would not let me see it; for he would not re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al the king's secrets;</Q> and besides, 'a prisoner,' he said, 'was not to see for what he was committed.' I told him, that was not reason: for how should he make his defence then? I said I ought to have a copy of it. But he said, There was a judge once, <Q>that fined one for letting a pri∣soner have a copy of his mittimus; and,</Q> said he, <Q>I have an old clerk, though I am a young justice.</Q> Then he called to his clerk, saying, 'Is it not ready yet? Bring it;' meaning the mittimus. But it not being ready, he told me I was a disturber of the nation. I told him, I had been a blessing to the nation, in and through the Lord's power and truth, and the Spirit of God in all consciences would answer it. Then he charged me as an <Q>enemy to the king, that I en∣deavoured to raise a new war, and imbrue the nation in blood again.</Q> I told him, I had never learned the postures of war, but was clear and innocent as a child con∣cerning those things; and therefore was bold. Then came the clerk with the mittimus, and the gaoler was sent for and commanded to take me, put me into the Dark-house, and
<PB N="404" REF="037441_0481_100D7F9113688568"/>let none come at me, but keep me there close prisoner till I should be delivered by the king or parliament. Then the justice asked the constables where my horse was? <Q>For I hear,</Q> said he, <Q>he hath a good horse; have ye brought his horse?</Q> I told him where my horse was, but he did not meddle with him. As they had me to the gaol the constable gave me my knife again, and then asked me to give it him: I told him, Nay; he had not been so civil to me. So they put me into the gaol, and the under-gaoler, one Hardy, a very wicked man, was exceeding rude and cruel, and many times would not let me have meat brought in, but as I could get it under the door. Many came to look at me, some in a rage, and very uncivil and rude. One time there came two young priests, and very abusive they were; the meanest people could not be worse. A∣mongst those that came in this manner, old Preston's wife of Howker was one. She used many abusive words to me, telling me, my 'tongue should be cut out,' and that <Q>I should be hanged;</Q> shewing me the gallows. But the Lord God cut her off, and she died in a miserable condition.</P>
<P>Being close prisoner in the common gaol at Lancaster, I desired Thomas Cummins and Thomas Green to go to the gaoler, and desire a copy of my mittimus, that I might know what I stood committed for. They went; and the gaoler answered,<Q>He could not give a copy of it, for an∣other had been fined for so doing;</Q> but he gave them liberty to read it over. To the best of their remembrance, the matters therein charged against me were, <Q>That I was a person generally suspected to be a common disturber of 'the peace of the nation, an enemy to the king, and a chief upholder of the Quakers sect; and that I, together with many of my fanatick opinion, have of late endeavoured to raise insurrections in these parts of the country, and embroil the whole country in blood. Wherefore the gaol∣er was commanded to keep me in safe custody, till I should be released by order from the king or parliament.</Q></P>
<P>When I had thus got the heads of the charge contained in the mittimus, I wrote a plain, downright answer, in vin∣dication of my innocency to each particular, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM a prisoner at Lancaster, committed by justice Porter. A copy of the mittimus I cannot get; but such expressions I am told are in it as are very untrue. As that I am <Q>generally suspected to be a common dis∣turber
<PB N="405" REF="037441_0482_100D7FBA03D46090"/>of the nation's peace, an enemy to the king, and that I, with others, should endeavour to raise insurrec∣tions, to embroil the nation in blood.</Q> All which is u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣terly false; and I do, in every part thereof, deny it. For I am not a person generally suspected to be a disturber of the nation's peace, nor have given any cause for such sus∣picion; for through the nation I have been tried for these things formerly. In the days of Oliver I was taken up on pretence of raising arms against him, which was also false; for I meddled not with raising arms at all. Yet I was then carried up prisoner to London, and brought before him; when I cleared myself, and denied the drawing of a carnal weapon against him, or any man upon the earth; for my weapons are spiritual, which take away the occa∣sion of war, and lead into peace. Upon my declaring this to Oliver, I was set at liberty by him. After this I was taken, and sent to prison by major Ceely, in Corn∣wall, who, when I was brought before the judge, informed against me, <Q>That I took him aside, and told him, that I could raise forty thousand men in an hour's time to in∣volve the nation in blood, and bring in king Charles.</Q> This also was utterly false, a lie of his own inventing, as was then proved upon him; for I never spoke any such word to him. I never was in any plot, I never took any engagement or oath, nor ever learned war-posture. As those were false charges against me then, so are these now which come from major Porter, who is lately appointed to be justice, but wanted power formerly to exercise his cruelty against us; which is but the wickedness of the old enemy. For the peace of the nation I am not a disturber of, nor ever was; but seek the peace thereof, and of all men, and stand for all nations peace and men's peace upon the earth, and wish that all nations and men knew my in∣nocency in these things.</P>
<P>And whereas major Porter saith, I am an <Q>enemy to the king,</Q> this is false; for my love is to <Q>him and to all men.</Q> even though they be enemies to God, to them∣selves, and me. And I can say, It is of the Lord that he is come in, to bring down many unrighteously set up; of which I had a fight three years before he came in. It is much he should say I am an enemy to the king; for I have no reason so to be, he having done nothing against me. But I have been often imprisoned and persecuted these eleven or twelve years by those that have been both
<PB N="406" REF="037441_0483_100D7FD3936316C8"/>against the king and his father, even the party that Porter was made a major by and bore arms for; but not by them that were for the king. I was never an enemy to the king, nor to any man's person upon the earth. I am in the love that fulfils the law, which thinks no evil, but loves even enemies; and would have the king saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and be brought into the fear of the Lord, to receive his wisdom from above, by which all things were made and created; that with that wisdom he may order all things to the glory of God.</P>
<P>Whereas he calleth me, <Q>A chief upholder of the Quaker's sect,</Q> I answer: the Quakers are not a sect, but are in the power of God, which was before sects were, and witness the election before the world began, and are come to live in the life which the prophets and apostles lived in who gave forth the scriptures; therefore are we hated by envious, wrathful, wicked, persecuting men. But God is the upholder of us all by his mighty power, and preserves us from the wrath of the wicked that would swallow us up.</P>
<P>And whereas the saith, <Q>That I, together with others of my fanatick opinion,</Q> as he calls it, <Q>have of late en∣deavoured to raise insurrections, and to embroil the whole kingdom in blood:</Q> This is altogether false; to these things I am as a child, and know nothing of them. The postures of war I never learned; my weapons are spiritual and not carnal, for with carnal weapons I do not fight. I am a follower of him who said, <Q>My kingdom is not of this world.</Q> And though these lies and slanders are raised upon me, I deny drawing of any carnal weapon against the king or parliament, or any man upon the earth; for I am come to the end of the law, <Q>to love enemies, and wrestle not with flesh and blood;</Q> but am in that which saves men's lives. A witness I am against all murderers, plotters, and all such as would "imbrue the nation in blood; for it is not in my heart to have any man's life destroyed. And as for the word fanatick, which signifies furious, foolish, mad, &amp;c. he might have consi∣dered himself before he had used that word, and have learned the humility which goes before honour. We are not turious, foolish, or mad; but through patience and meekness have borne lies, slanders, and persecutions ma∣ny years, and have undergone great sufferings. The spi∣ritual man, that wrestles not with flesh and blood, and the
<PB N="407" REF="037441_0484_100D7FD518DB3478"/>Spirit that reproves sin in the gate, which is the Spirit of truth, wisdom, and sound judgment, is not mad, foolish furious, which fanatick signifies; but all are of a mad, fu∣rious, foolish spirit, that wrestle with flesh and blood, with carnal weapons, in their furiousness, foolishness, and rage. This is not the Spirit of God, but of error, that persecutes in a mad, blind, zeal, like Nebuchadnezzar and Saul.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as I am ordered to be kept prisoner till I be delivered by order from the king or parliament, therefore I have written these things to be laid before you, the king and parliament, that ye may consider of them before ye act any thing therein; that ye may weigh, in the wisdom of God, the intent and end of men's spirits, lest ye act the thing that will bring the hand of the Lord upon you and against you, as many have done before you who have been in authority, whom God hath overthrown. In him we trust whom we fear and cry unto day and night, who hath heard us, doth hear us, and will hear us, and avenge our cause. Much innocent blood hath been shed. Many have been persecuted to death by such as were in authority before you, whom God hath vomited out because they turned against the just. Therefore consider your standing now that ye have the day, and receive this as a warning of love to you.</P>

<P>Upon my being taken, and forcibly carried away from Margaret Fell's, and charged with things of so high a nature. she was concerned, looking upon it to be an injury offered to her. Whereupon she wrote the following lines, and sent them abroad, directed thus:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To all magistrates concerning the wrong taking up and im∣prisoning George Fox at Lancaster.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO inform the governors of this nation, that Henry Porter, mayor of Lancaster, sent a warrant with four constables to my house, for which he had no authority nor order. They searched my house, and apprehended George Fox in it, who was not guilty of the breach of any law, or of any offence against any in the nation. After they had taken him and brought him before the said Henry Porter, bail
<PB N="408" REF="037441_0485_100D9121DDB42040"/>was offered what he would demand for his appearance, to answer what could be laid to his charge; but he (contrary to law, if he had taken him lawfully) denied to accept of any bail, and clapped him up in close prison. After he was in prison a copy of his mittimus was demanded, which ought not to be denied to any prisoner, that he may see what is laid to his charge; but it was denied him; a copy he could not have, only they were suffered to read it over. Every thing there charged against him was utterly false; he was not guilty of any one charge in it, as will be prov∣ed and manifested to the nation. Let the governors con∣sider of it. I am concerned in this thing, inasmuch as he was apprehended in my house, and if he be guilty, I am so too. I desire to have this searched out.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After this Margaret Fell determined to go to London to speak with the king about my being taken, to shew him the manner of it, and the unjust dealing and evil usage I had received. Which when justice Porter heard of, he vapour∣ed that he would go and meet her in the gap. But when he came before the king, he having been a zealous man for the parliament against the king, several courtiers spoke to him concerning his plundering their houses; so he had quickly enough of the court, and returned into the country. Meanwhile the gaoler seemed very fearful, and said, He was afraid major Porter would hang him because he had not put me in the Dark-house. But when the gaoler went to wait on him, after he was come from London, he was very blank and down, and asked 'how I did?' pretending he would find a way to set me at liberty. But having overshot himself in his mittimus, by ordering me <Q>to be kept prisoner till I should be delivered by the king or parliament,</Q>he had put it out of his power to release me if he would. He was the more dejected also upon reading a letter which I sent him; for when he was in the height of his rage and threats against me, and thought to ingratiate himself into the king's favour by imprisoning me, I was moved to write to him, and put him in mind, <Q>How fierce he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>st the king and his party, though now he would be thought zealous for the king.</Q> Among other passages in my letter, I called to his remembrance, that when he held Lancaster castle for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liament against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng he was so rough and frience against those that favoured
<PB N="409" REF="037441_0486_100D91236DDF7050"/>the king, that he said, <Q>He wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld leave them neither dog nor cat if they did not bring him provision to his castle. I asked him also, Whose great buck's horns those were that were in his house? and where he had them and the wainscot that he cieled his house withal? Had he not them from Hornby castle?</Q></P>
<P>About this time Ann Curtis, of Reading, came to see me; and understanding how I stood committed, it was upon her also to go to the king about it. Her father, who had been sheriff of Bristol, was hanged near his own door for endeavouring to bring the king in; upon which consi∣deration she had some hopes the king might hear her on my behalf. Accordingly, when she returned to London, she and Margaret Fell went to the king together; who, when he understood whose daughter she was, received her kindly. And her request to him being <Q>to send for me up, and hear the cause himself,</Q> he promised her he would, and commanded his secretary to send an order for bringing me up. But when they came to the secretary for the or∣der, he said, <Q>It was not in his power; he must go accord∣ing to law; and I must be brought up by an Habeas Corpus before the judges.</Q> So he wrote to the judge of the king's bench, signifying it was the king's pleasure I should be sent up by an Habeas Corpus. Accordingly a writ was sent, and delivered to the sheriff; but becausse it was directed to the chancellor of Lancaster, the sheriff put it off to him; on the other hand the chancellor would not make the warrant upon it, but said the sheriff must do that. At length both chancellor and sheriff were got together; but being both enemies to truth they sought occasion for delay, and found an error in the writ, which was, that be∣ing directed to the chancellor, it said, <Q>George Fox in prison under YOUR custody,</Q> whereas the prison I was in was not in the chancellor's custody, but the sheriff's; so the word YOUR should have been HIS. Upon this they returned the writ to London again, only to have that one word altered. When it was altered and brought down again, the sheriff refused to carry me up, unless I would seal a writing to him, and become bound to pay for the sealing and the charge of carrying me up: which I denied, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing them, I would not seal any thing to them, nor be bound. So the matter rested awhile, and I continued in prison. Meanwhile the assize came on; but as there was a writ for removing me up, I was not brought before the
<PB N="410" REF="037441_0487_100D9125ECAB39F8"/>judge. At the assize many came to see me. I was moved to speak out of the gaol-window to them, and shew them, <Q>How uncertain their religion was, and that every sort, when uppermost, had persecuted the rest. When popery was uppermost, people had been persecuted for not fol∣lowing the mass; and those who held it up cried, <Q>It was the higher power,</Q> and people must be subject to the higher power. Afterwards they that set up the Common Prayer persecuted others for not following that; saying, "It was the higher power, and we must be subject to that." Since that, the Presbyterians and Independents cried each of them, <Q>We mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be subject to the higher power, and submit to the directory of the one and the church faith of the other.</Q> Thus all, like the apostate Jews, have cried, "Help, men of Israel, against the true Christians." So people might see how uncertain they are of their religions. But I directed them to Christ Jesus, that they might be built upon him, the Rock and Foundation, that changeth not.</Q> Much on this wise I declared to them, and they were quiet and very attentive. Afterwards I gave forth a lit∣tle paper concerning True Religion, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TRUE Religion is the true rule and right way of serv∣ing God. And religion is a pure stream of righteous∣ness flowing from the image of God, and is the life and power of God planted in the heart and mind by the law of life, which bringeth the soul, mind, spirit, and body to be conformable to God, the Father of Spirits, and to Christ; so that they come to have fellowship with the Fa∣ther and the Son, and with all his holy angels and saints. This religion is pure from above, undefiled before God, leads to visit the fatherless, widows, and strangers, and keeps from the spots of the world. This religion is above all the defiled, spotted religions in the world, that keep not from defilements and spots, but leave their professors impure, below, and spotted; whose fatherless, widows, and strangers, beg up and down the streets.</P>

<P>Soon after this I gave forth another against persecution, on this wise:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

They would destroy by a law, as the disciples once would have done by prayer, who would have commanded <Q>fire to come down from heaven,</Q> to destroy them that would not receive Christ. But Christ rebuked them, and told them, <Q>They knew not what spirit they are of.</Q> If they did not know what spirit they were of; do these who have persecuted about re∣ligion since the apostles days, who would compel men's bodies, goods, lives, souls, and estates into their hands by law, or make them suffer? Those that destroy men's lives are not the ministers of Christ, the Saviour; and seeing they know not what spirit they are of, the lives, bodies, and souls of men are not to be trusted in their hands. And ye that persecute shall have no resurrection to life with God, except ye repent. But they that know what spirit they are of themselves are in the unrebukeable zeal, and by the Spirit of God they offer up their spirits, souls, and bo∣dies to the Lord, which are his, to keep them.</P>

<PB N="412" REF="037441_0489_100D9129DEC9AB08"/>Lord that it should be so, and he will be served by it. Therefore let none murmur, nor distrust God; for he will provoke many to zeal against unrighteousness, and for righteousness, through things which are suffered now to work for a season: yea many, whose zeal has been even dead, shall revive again, and they shall see their backslid∣ings and bewail them bitterly. For <Q>God shall thunder from heaven, and break forth in a mighty noise, his ene∣mies shall be astonished, the workers of iniquity con∣founded, and all that have not on the garment of righte∣ousness shall be amazed at the mighty and strange work of the Lord, which shall be certainly brought to pass.</Q> But my children, look ye not out, but be still in the light of the Lamb, and he shall fight for you. The Almighty Hand, which must break and divide your enemies, and take away peace from them, preserve and keep you whole, in unity and peace with himself, and one with another. Amen.</P>

<P>THOU camest not into this nation by sword, nor by victory of war, but by the power of the Lord. Now if thou dost not live in it, thou wilt not prosper. If the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath shewed thee mercy and forgiven thee, and thou dost not shew mercy and forgive, God will not hear thy prayers, nor them that pray for thee. If thou dost not stop persecution and persecutors, and take away all laws that hold up persecution about religion; if thou persist in them, and uphold persecution, that will make thee as blind as those that have gone before thee: for persecution hath always blinded those that have gone into it. Such God by his power overthrows, doth his valiant acts upon, and bringeth salvation to his oppressed ones. If thou bear the sword in vain, and let drunkenness, oaths, plays, may∣games, with such like abominations and vanities be en∣couraged or go unpunished, as setting up of May-poles, with the image of the crown atop of them, &amp;c. the na∣tions
<PB N="413" REF="037441_0490_100D912B7291D4D0"/>will quickly turn like Sodom and Gomorrah, and be as bad as the old world, who grieved the Lord till he overthrew them; and so he will you, if these things be not suppressed. Hardly was there so much wickedness at li∣berty before as there is at this day, as though there was no terror nor sword of magistracy; which doth not grace a government, nor is a praise to them that do well. Our prayers are for them that are in authority, that under them we may live a godly life, in which we have peace, and that we may not be brought into ungodliness by them. Hear and consider, and do good in thy time, whilst thou hast power; be merciful and forgive; that is the way to overcome and obtain the kingdom of Christ.</P>

<P>It was long before the sheriff would yield to remove me to London, unless I would seal a bond to him, and bear their charges; which I still refused to do. Then they con∣sulted how to convey me up, and first concluded to send up a party of horse with me. I told them, <Q>If I were such a man as they had represented me to be, they had need send a troop or two of horse to guard me.</Q> When they considered what a charge it would be to them to send up a party of horse with me, they altered their purpose, and con∣cluded to send me up guarded only by the gaoler and some bailiffs. But upon farther consideration they found that would be a great charge to them also, and therefore sent for me to the gaoler's house, and told me, if I would put in bail that I would be in London such a day of the term, I should have leave to go up with some of my own friends. I told them I would neither put in bail, nor give one piece of sil∣ver to the gaoler; for I was an innocent man, they had im∣prisoned me wrongfully, and laid a false charge upon me. Nevertheless I said, If they would let me go up with one or two of my friends to bear me company, I might go up and be in London such a day, if the Lord should permit; and, if they desired it, I or any of my friends that went with me would carry up their charge against myself. When they saw they could do no otherwise with me, the sheriff con∣sented that <Q>I should come up with some of my friends, without any other engagement than my word, to appear before the judges at London such a day of the term, if the Lord should permit.</Q> Whereupon I was let out of prison, and went to Swarthmore, where I staid two or three
<PB N="414" REF="037441_0491_100D912DC29F2C50"/>days; and from thence went to Lancaster, and so to Pres∣ton, having meetings amongst friends till I came into Che∣shire, to William Gandy's, where was a large meeting with∣out doors, the house not being sufficient to contain it. That day the Lord's everlasting seed was set over all, and friends were turned to it, who is the heir of the promise. Thence I came into Staffordshire and Warwickshire, to An∣thony Bickliff's, and at Non-caton, at a priest's widow's house, we had a blessed meeting, wherein the everlasting word of life was powerfully declared, and many settled in it. Then travelling on, visiting friends meetings, in about three weeks time from my coming out of prison, I reached London, Richard Hubberthorn and Robert Withers being with me.</P>
<P>When we came to Charing-cross, multitude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of people were gathered together to see the burning of the bowels of some of the old king's judges, who had been hanged, drawn and quartered.</P>
<P>We went next morning to judge Mallet's chamber, who was putting on his gown to sit upon more of the king's judges. He was then very peevish and froward, and said, I might come another time. We went another time to his chamber, when judge Foster was with him, who was called Lord Chief Justice of England. With me was one called Esquire Marsh, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the bed-chamber to the king. When we had delivered to the judges the charge against me, and they had read to those words, <Q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood,</Q> &amp;c. they struck their hands on the table. Whereupon I told them, <Q>I was the man whom that charge was against, but I was as innocent of any such thing as a new-born child, and had brought it up myself; and some of my friends came up with me, without any guard.</Q> As yet they had not minded my hat; but now, seeing my hat on, they said, <Q>What, did I stand with my hat on!</Q> I told them I did not stand so in any contempt of them. Then they commanded one to take it off; and when they had called for the maishal of the king's bench, they said to him, You must take this man and secure him, but you must let him have a chamber, and not put him amongst the prisoners. My Lord, said the marshal, I have no chamber to put him into; my house is so full that I cannot tell where to provide for him but amongst the prisoners. Nay, said the judges, you must not put him amongst the prisoners. But whet he still answered, he had
<PB N="415" REF="037441_0492_100D91300E892160"/>no other place to put me in, judge Foster said to me, <Q>Wall you appear to-morrow, about ten of the clock, at the king's bene. bar in Westminster-hall?</Q> I said, <Q>Yes, if the Lord give me strength.</Q> Then said judge Foster to the other judge, <Q>If he says yes, and promises it, you may take his word.</Q> So I was dismissed. The next day I ap∣peared at the king's bench bar at the hour appointed, Robert Withers, Richard Hubberthorn, and Esquire Marsh going with me. I was brought into the middle of the court, and as soon as I came in I was moved to look about, and turn∣ing to the people, said, 'Peace be among you;' and the power of the Lord sprang over the court. The charge against me was read openly. The people were moderate, and the judges cool and loving; and the Lord's mercy was to them. But when they came to that part of it which said, <Q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood and raising a new war, and that I was an enemy to the king,</Q> &amp;c. they lifted up their hands. Then, stretch∣ing out my arms, I said, <Q>I am the man whom that charge is against, but I am as innocent as a child concerning the charge, and have never learned any war postures. And, said I, do ye think, that if I and my friends were such men as the charge declares, that I should have brought it up myself against myself? Or that I should be suffered to come up with one or two of my friends with me? Had I been such a man as this charge sets forth, I had need to have been guarded up with a troop or two of horse. But the sheriff and magistrates of Lancashire thought fit to let me and my friends come up with it ourselves, almost two hundred mile, without any guard at all; which, you may 'be sure they would not have done if they had looked upon me to be such a man.</Q> The judge asked me, Whether it should be filed? or what I would do with it? I answered, Ye are judges, and able, I hope, to judge in this matter; therefore do with it what ye will; for I am the man these charges are against, and here ye see I have brought them up myself. Do ye what ye will with them, I leave it to you. Then judge Twisden beginning to speak some angry words, I appealed to judge Foster and judge Mallet, who had heard me over night. Whereupon they said, <Q>They did not accuse me, for they had nothing against me.</Q> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> stood up <Q>squire Marsh, and told the judges, It was the king's pleasure that I should be set at liberty, seeing no accuser came up against me.</Q> They asked me, <Q>Whether
<PB N="416" REF="037441_0493_100D91319E195280"/>I would put it to the king and council?</Q> I said, <Q>Yes, with a good-will.</Q> Thereupon they sent the sheriff's re∣turn, which he made to the writ of Habeas Corpus, con∣taining the matter charged against me in the mittimus, to the king, that he might see for what I was committed. The return of the sheriff of Lancaster was thus:</P>

<P>Thus, after I had been a prisoner somewhat more than twenty weeks, I was freely set at liberty by the king's com∣mand, the Lord's power having wonderfully wrought for the clearing of my innocency, and Porter, who committed me, not daring to appear to make good the charge he had falsely suggested against me. But after it was known I was discharged, a company of envious, wicked spirits were trou∣bled, and terror took hold of justice Porter; for he was afraid I would take the advantage of the law against him for my wrong imprisonment, and thereby undo him, his wife, and children. And indeed I was pressed by some in authority to have made him and the rest examples; but I said, I should leave them to the Lord; if the Lord forgave them I should not trouble myself with them.</P>
<P>Now did I see the end of the travail which I had in my sore exercise at Reading; for the everlasting power of the Lord was over all, and his blessed truth, life, and light shined over the nation, and great and glorious meetings we had, and very quiet; and many flocked unto the truth. Richard Hubberthorn had been with the king, who said, 'None should molest us so long as we lived peaceably,' and promised this upon the word of a king; telling him, we might make use of his promise. Some friends were also ad∣mitted in the house of Lords, to declare their reasons, why
<PB N="418" REF="037441_0495_100D913552A70640"/>they could not pay tithes, swear, nor go to the steeple-house-worship or join with others in worship; and they heard them moderately. There being about seven hundred friends in prison, who had been committed under Oliver's and Richard's government, upon contempts (so called) when the king came in he set them all at liberty. There seemed at that time an inclination and intention in the government to have granted friends liberty, because they were sensible we had suffered as well as they under the former powers. But when any thing was going forward in order thereunto, some dirty spirits or other, that would seem to be for us, threw something in the way to stop it. It was said there was an instrument drawn up for confirming our liberty, which only wanted signing; when on a sudden that wicked attempt of the Fifth-monarchy-people broke out, and put the city and nation in an uproar. This was on a first-day night, and very glorious meetings we had that day, wherein the Lord's truth shined over all, and his power was exalted above all; but about midnight the drums beat, and the cry was, 'Arm, Arm.' I got out of bed, and in the morning took boat, and landing at Whitehall-stairs, walked through Whitehall. They looked strangely at me there; but I pas∣sed through, and went to Pall-mall, whither divers friends came to me, though it was now grown dangerous passing the streets; for by this time the city and suburbs were up in arms, and exceeding rude the people and soldiers were; in∣fomuch that Henry Fell, going to a friend's house, the sol∣diers knocked him down, and he had been killed if the duke of York had not come by. Great mischief was done in the city this week; and when first-day came, that friends went to their meetings, many were taken prisoners. I staid at Pall-mall, intending to be at the meeting there; but on the seventh-day night a company of troopers came and knocked at the door. The maid letting them in, they strait laid hold of me; and there being amongst them one, that had served under the parliament, he clapped his hand to my pocket, and asked, 'Whether I had any pistols?' I told him, He knew I did not use to carry pistols; why did he ask such a question of me, who he knew to be a peaceable man? O∣thers of the soldiers ran up into the chambers, and there found in bed 'squire Marsh, who, though he was one of the king's bed-chamber, out of his love to me had come and lodged where I did. When they came down again, they said, 'Why should we take this man away with us? We
<PB N="419" REF="037441_0496_100D9137C6F4A7A8"/>will let him alone, Oh! said the parliament-soldier, he is one of the heads and a chief ringleader. Upon this the soldiers were taking me away; but 'squire Marsh hearing of it, sent for the commander of the party, and desired him to let me alone, for he would see me forth-coming in the morning. In the morning, before they could fetch me, and before the meeting was gathered, there came a company of foot to the house, and one of them, drawing his sword, held it over my head. I asked him, <Q>Why he drew his sword at a naked man?</Q> At which his fellows being ashamed bid him put up his sword. These soldiers took me away to Whitehall before the troopers came for me. As I was going out several friends were coming in to the meeting, whose boldness and cheerfulness I commended, and encouraged them to persevere therein. When I was brought to Whitehall, the soldiers and people were exceed∣ing rude, yet I declared truth to them; but some great persons coming by, who were very full of envy, 'What,' said they, <Q>do ye let him preach? Put him into such a place where he may not stir.</Q> So into that place they put me, and the soldiers watched over me. I told them, Tho' they could confine my body and shut that up, they could not stop up the word of life. Some thereupon came, and asked me, 'What I was?' I told them, I was a preacher of righteousness. After I had been kept there two or three hours, 'squire Marsh spoke to lord Gerrard, who came and bid them set me at liberty. The marshal, when I was dis∣charged, demanded fees. I told him, I could not give him any, neither was it our practice. I asked him, How he could demand fees of me who was innocent? Then I went through the guards, the Lord's power being over them; and after I had declared truth to the soldiers, I went up the streets with two Irish colonels that came from White∣hall to an inn, where many friends were prisoners under a guard. I desired those colonels to speak to the guard to let me go in to visit my friends that were prisoners there; but they would not. Then I stept to the centry, and de∣sired him to let me go up; which he did. While I was there the soldiers went to Pall-mall again to search for me; but not finding me they turned towards the inn, and bid all come out that were not prisoners; so they went out. But I asked the soldiers within, Whether I might not stay awhile with my friends? They said, Yes. I staid, and escaped their hands again. Towards night I went to Pall-mall, to
<PB N="420" REF="037441_0497_100D9139AF29FD68"/>see how it was with friends there, and after went into the city. Great rifling of houses there was at that time to search for people. I went to a private friend's house and Richard Hubberthorn with me. There we drew up a declaration against plots and fightings, to be presented to the king and council; but when we had finished it, and sent it to the press, it was taken in the press.</P>
<P>Upon this insurrection of the Fifth-monarchy-men great havock was made both in city and country, so that it was dangerous for sober people to stir abroad several weeks after; and hardly could either men or women go up and down the streets to buy provisions for their families without being abused. In the country they dragged men and women out of their houses, and some sick men out of their beds by the legs. Nay, one that was in a fever the soldiers dragged out of his bed to prison; and when he was brought thither he died. His name was Thomas Patching.</P>
<P>Margaret Fell went to the king, and told him what sad work there was in the city and nation, and shewed him we were an innocent peaceable people, and that we must keep our meetings as we used to do whatever we suffered; but it concerned him to see that peace was kept, that no inno∣cent blood might be shed.</P>
<P>Now were the prisons every where filled with friends and others in the city and country, and the posts were so laid for the searching of letters, that none could pass unsearched. We heard of several thousands of our friends that were cast into prison in several parts of the nation, and Margaret Fell carried an account of them to the king and council. The next week we had an account of several thousands more that were cast into prison, and she went and laid them also before the king and council. They wondered how we could have such intelligence, seeing they had given such strict charge for the intercepting of all letters; but the Lord did so order it that we had an account notwithstanding all their stoppings. In the deep sense I had of the grievous sufferings friends underwent, and of their innocency to∣wards God and man, I was moved to send the following epistle to them, as a word of consolation, and to put them upon sending up their sufferings.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Presented to the king <DATE>the 21st day of the 11th month, 1660.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OUR principle is, and our practices have always been to seek peace and ensue it; to follow after righteous∣ness and the knowledge of God; seeking the good and welfare, and doing that which tends to the peace of all. We know that wars and fightings proceed from the lusts of men, as Jam. iv. 1, 2, 3, out of which lusts the Lord
<PB N="422" REF="037441_0499_100D913DD32D64B0"/>hath redeemed us, and so out of the occasion of war. The occasion of war and the war itself (wherein envious men, who are lovers of themselves more than lovers of God, lust, kill, and desire to have men's lives or estates) ariseth from the lust. All bloody principles and practices we, as to our own particulars, do utterly deny, with all outward wars, strife, and fighting with outward weapons for any end, or under any pretence whatsoever: this is our testimony to the whole world.</P>
<P>And whereas it is objected: But although you now say, <Q>That you cannot fight nor take up arms at all; yet if the Spirit move you, then you will change your principle, you will sell your coat and buy a sword, and fight for the kingdom of Christ.</Q></P>
<P>To this we answer, Christ said to Peter, <Q>Put up thy sword in his place;</Q> though he had said before, he that had no sword might sell his coat and buy one (to the ful∣filling of the law and the scripture) yet after, when he had bid him put it up, he said, <Q>He that taketh the sword shall perish with the sword.</Q> And Christ said to Pilate, <Q>Thinkest thou, that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</Q> And this might satisfy Peter, Luke xxii. 36. after he had put up his sword, when he said to him, <Q>He that took it, should perish by it;</Q> which satisfieth us, Mat. xxvi. 51, 52, 53. In the Revelations it is said, <Q>He that kills with the sword shall perish with the sword; and here is the faith and the patience of the saints.</Q> So Christ's kingdom is not of this world, therefore do not his servants fight, as he told Pilate, the magistrate who cruci∣fied him. And did they not look upon Christ as a raiser of sedition? and did not he pray, "Forgive them?" But thus it is that we are numbered amongst transgressors, and amongst fighters, that the scriptures might be fulfilled.</P>
<P>That the Spirit of Christ, by which we are guided, is not changeable, so as once to command us from a thing, as evil, and again to move unto it. We certainly know and testify to the world, That the Spirit of Christ, which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ nor for the kingdoms of this world.</P>
<P>First, Because the kingdom of Christ God will exalt, according to his promise, and cause it to grow and slourish in righteousness, <Q>Not by might, nor by power (of out∣ward
<PB N="423" REF="037441_0500_100D91402207AB80"/>sword) but by my Spirit, saith the Lord,</Q> Zech. iv. 6. So those that use any weapon to fight for Christ, or for the establishing of his kingdom or government, their spirit, principle, and practice we deny.</P>
<P>Secondly, We earnestly desire and wait, that (by the word of God's power, and its effectual operation in the hearts of men) the kingdoms of this world may become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; and that he may rule and reign in men by his Spirit and truth; that thereby all people, out of all different judgments and professions, may be brought into love and unity with God, and one with another; and that all may come to witness the prophet's words fulfilled, who said, <Q>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more,</Q> Isa. ii. 4 Mich. iv. 3.</P>
<P>Since we, whom the Lord hath called into the obedi∣ence of his truth, have denied wars and fightings, and cannot any more learn them. This is a certain testimony unto all the world of the truth of our hearts in this parti∣cular, that as God persuadeth every man's heart to be∣lieve, so they may receive it. For we have not, as some others, gone about cunningly with devised fables, nor have we ever denied in practice what we have professed in prin∣ciple; but in sincerity and truth, and by the word of God, have we laboured to be made manifest unto all men, that both we and our ways might be witnessed in the hearts of all. And whereas all manner of evil hath been falsely spoken of us, we hereby speak the plain truth of our hearts, to take away the occasion of that offence, that so we, being innocent, may not suffer for other men's of∣fences, nor be made a prey of by the wills of men for that of which we were never guilty; but in the uprightness of our hearts we may, under the power ordained of God for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well, live a peaceable life in all godliness and ho∣nesty. For although we have always suffered, and do now more abundantly suffer, yet we know it is for right∣eousness sake: <Q>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our consciences, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world,</Q> 2 Cor. i. 12, which for us is a witness for the convincing of our ene∣mies. For this we can say to all the world, we have wronged no man, we have used no force nor violence
<PB N="424" REF="037441_0501_100D9141B34A8610"/>against any man, we have been found in no plots, nor guilty of sedition. When we have been wronged we have not sought to revenge ourselves, we have not made resistance against authority; but wherein we could not obey for con∣science sake, we have suffered the most of any people in the nation. We have been counted as sheep for the slaughter, persecuted and despised, beaten, stoned, wound∣ed, stocked, whipped, imprisoned, haled out of the syna∣gogues, cast into dungeons and noisome vaults, where ma∣ny have died in bonds, shut up from our friends, denied needful sustenance for many days together, with other the like cruelties. And the cause of all these our sufferings is not for any evil, but for things relating to the worship of our God, and in obedience to his requirings. <Q>For which cause we shall freely give up our bodies a sacrifice, rather than disobey the Lord;</Q> knowing, as the Lord hath kept us innocent, he will plead our cause when there is none in the earth to plead it. So we, in obedience to his truth, do not love our lives unto death, that we may do his will, and wrong no man in our generation, but seck the good and peace of all men. He who hath commanded us, "That we shall not swear at all," Matth. v. 34, hath also commanded us, "That we shall not kill," Matth. v. So that we can neither kill men, nor swear for nor against them. This is both our principle and our practice, and hath been from the beginning; so that if we suffer, as sus∣pected to take up arms or make war against any, it is without any ground from us; for it neither is, nor ever was in our hearts, since we owned the truth of God; nei∣ther shall we ever do it, because it is contrary to the Spirit of Christ, his doctrine, and the practices of his apostles; even contrary to him for whom we suffer all things and endure all things.</P>
<P>And whereas men come against us with clubs, staves, drawn swords, pistols cock'd, and beat, cut, and abuse us; yet we never resisted them, but to them our hair, backs, and cheeks have been ready. It is not an honour to manhood or nobility to run upon harmless people, who lift not an hand against them, with arms and weapons.</P>
<P>Therefore consider these things, ye men of understand∣ing; for plotters, raisers of insurrections, tumultuous ones, and fighters, running with swords, clubs, staves, and pis∣tols, one against another; we say, these are of the world, and have their foundation from this unrighteous world,
<PB N="425" REF="037441_0502_100D914347E2B510"/>from the foundation of which the Lamb hath been slain: which Lamb hath redeemed us from this unrighteous world; we are not of it, but are heirs of a world of which there is no end, a kingdom where no corruptible thing enters. Our weapons are spiritual, not carnal, yet mighty through God to the pulling down of the strong holds of sin and Satan, who is the author of wars, fighting, murder, and plots. Our swords are broken into plough-shares, and spears into pruning-hooks, as prophesied of in Micah iv. Therefore we cannot learn war any more, neither rise up against nation or kingdom with outward weapons, though you have numbered us amongst the transgressors and plotters. The Lord knows our innocency herein, and will plead our cause with all people upon earth at the day of their judgment, when all men shall have a re∣ward according to their works.</P>
<P>Therefore in love we warn you for your souls good, not to wrong the innocent, nor the babes of Christ, which he hath in his hand, and tenders as the apple of his eye; neither seek to destroy the heritage of God, nor turn your swords backward upon such as the law was not made for, i. e. the righteous; but for the sinners and transgressors, to keep them down. For those are not peace-makers nor lovers of enemies, neither can they overcome evil with good, who wrong them that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ends to you and all men, and wish your good and the good of all people upon earth. If you oppress us as they did the children of Israel in Egypt, if you oppress us as they did when Christ was born, and as they did the Christians in the primitive times, we can say, "The Lord forgive you;" leave the Lord to deal with you, and not revenge our∣selves. If you say, as the council said to Peter and John, "You must speak no more in that name;" and if you serve us as they served the three children spoken of in Daniel, God is the same as he ever was, that lives for ever and ever, who hath the innocent in his arms.</P>
<P>Oh! friends! offend not the Lord and his little ones, neither afflict his people; but consider and be moderate, Run not hastily into things, but mind and consider mercy, justice, and judgment; that is the way for you to prosper and get the favour of the Lord. Our meetings were stop∣ped and broken up in the days of Oliver, under pretence of plotting against him; in the days of the Committee of Safety we were looked upon as plotters to bring in king
<PB N="426" REF="037441_0503_100D91460AB23090"/>Charles; and now our peaceable meetings are termed se∣ditious. Oh! that men should lose their reason, and go contrary to their own consciences; knowing that we have suffered all things, and have been accounted plotters all along, though we have always declared against them both by word of mouth and printing, and are clear from any such thing! Though we have suffered all along, because we would not take up carnal weapons to fight against any, and are thus made a prey upon because we are the inno∣cent lambs of Christ, and cannot avenge ourselves! These things are left upon your hearts to consider; for we are out of all those things in the patience of the saints, and we know as Christ said, <Q>He that takes the sword shall perish with the sword,</Q> Matth. xxvi. 52. Rev. xiii. 10.</P>
<P><Q>This is given forth from the people called Quakers, to satisfy the king and his council, and all that have any jealousy concerning us, that all occasion of suspicion may be taken away, and our innocency cleared.</Q></P>

<P>Though we are numbered amongst transgressors, and have been given up to rude, merciless men, by whom our meetings are broken up, in which we edified one another in our holy faith, and prayed together to the Lord that lives for ever, yet he is our pleader in this day. The Lord saith, "They that feared his name spoke often together," as in Malachi; which were as his jewels. For this cause, and no evil doing, are we cast into holes, dungeons, houses of correction, prisons (sparing neither old nor young, men nor women) and made a prey of in the sight of all nations, under pretence of being seditious, &amp;c. so that all rude peo∣ple run upon us to take possession; for which we say, The Lord forgive them that have thus done to us; who doth and will enable us to suffer; and never shall we lift up hand against any man that doth thus use us; but that the Lord may have mercy upon them, that they may consider what they have done. For how is it possible for them to requite us for the wrong they have done to us? Who to all nations have sounded us abroad as seditious or plotters, who were never plotters against any power or man upon the earth, since we knew the life and power of Jesus Christ manifested in us, who hath redeemed us from the world
<PB N="427" REF="037441_0504_100D914803FC1888"/>and all works of darkness, and plotters therein, by which we know the election before the world began. So we say. The Lord have mercy upon our enemies, and forgive them for what they have done unto us.</P>
<P>Oh! do as you would be done by; do unto all men as you would have them do unto you; for this is the law and the prophets.</P>
<P>All plots, insurrections, and riotous meetings, we deny, knowing them to be of the devil, the murderer; which we in Christ, who was before they were, triumph over. And all wars and fightings with carnal weapous we deny, who have the sword of the Spirit; and all that wrong us, we leave to the Lord. This is to clear our innocency from that aspersion cast upon us, <Q>That we are seditious or plotters.</Q></P>

<P>THIS was our testimony above twenty years ago, and since then we have not been found acting contrary to it, nor ever shall; for the truth that is our guide is un∣changeable. This is now reprinted to the men of this age, many of whom were then children, and doth stand as our certain testimony against all plot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g and fighting with carnal weapons. And if any, by departing from the truth, should do so, this is our testimony in the truth against them, and will stand over them, and the truth will be clear of them.</P>
<P>This Declaration did somewhat clear the dark air that was over the city and country; and soon after the king gave forth a proclamation, <Q>That no soldiers should search any house without a constable.</Q>But the gaols were still full, many thousands of friends being in prison; which mischief was occasioned by the wicked rising of those Fifth-monarchy-men. But when those of them that were taken came to be executed, they did us the justice to clear us openly from having any hand in or knowledge of their plot. After that the king, being continually importuned thereun∣to, issued forth a Declaration, <Q>That friends should be set at liberty without paying fees.</Q> But great labour, tra∣vail, 'and pains were taken before this was obtained; for Thomas Moor and Margaret Fell went often to the king about it.</P>

Much blood was shed this year, many of the old king's judges being hanged, drawn, and quartered. Amongst those that suffered colonel Hacker was one, who sent me prisoner from Leicester to London in Oliver's time. A sad day it was, and a repaying of blood with blood. For in the time of O. Cromwel, when several were hanged, drawn, and quartered for pretended treasons, I felt from the Lord God that their blood would not be put up, but would be required, and I said as much then to several, and now also upon the king's return, when several that had been against the king were put to death, as the others that were for the king had been before by Oliver. This was sad work, de∣stroying people contrary to the nature of Christians, who have the nature of lambs and sheep. But there was a secret hand in bringing this day upon that hypocritical generation of professors, who being got into power grew proud, haughty, and cruel beyond others, and persecuted the people of God without pity. Therefore when friends were under cruel persecutions and sufferings in the commonwealth's time, I was moved of the Lord to write unto them, to draw up their sufferings, and lay them before the justices at their sessions; and if they would not do them justice, then to lay them before the judges at the assize; and if they refused them justice, to lay it before the parliament, and before the protec∣tor and his council, that they might all see what was done under their government; and if they would not do justice, then to lay it before the Lord, who would hear the cries of the oppressed, the widows, and fatherless, whom they had made so. For that which we suffered for, and which our goods were spoiled for, was our obedience to the Lord in his Power and in his Spirit, who is able to help and suc∣cour, and we had no helper in the earth but him. And he heard the cries of his people, and brought an overflowing scourge over the heads of all our persecutors, which brought a quaking, a dread, and a fear amongst and on them all; so that those who had nick-named us (who are the children of light) and in scorn called us Quakers, the Lord made to quake, and many of them would have been glad to have hid themselves amongst us; and some of them, through the distress that came upon them, did at length consess to the truth. Oh! the daily reproaches, revilings, and beatings we underwent amongst them, even in the highways, because we could not put off our hats to them, and for saying Thou and Thee to them! Oh! the havock and spoil the priests
<PB N="429" REF="037441_0506_100D914B27200978"/>made of our goods, because we could not put into their mouths and give them tithes! Besides casting into prisons, and besides the great fines laid upon us because we could not swear! But for all these things did the Lord God plead with them. Yet some of them were so hardened in their wickedness, that when they were turned out of their places and offices, they said, <Q>If they had power they would do the same again.</Q> And when this day of over∣turning was come upon them, they said, <Q>It was all along of us.</Q>Wherefore I was moved to write to them, and to ask, <Q>Did we ever resist them when they took away our ploughs and plough-gears, our carts and horses, our corn and cattle, our kettles and platters from us, and whipped us, and set us in the stocks, and cast us into prison, and all this only for serving and worshipping God in spirit and truth, and because we could not conform to their re∣ligions, manners, customs, and fashions? Did we ever resist them? Did we not give them our backs to beat, our cheeks to pull off the hair, and our faces to spit on? Had not their priests, that prompted them on to such work, plucked them with themselves into the ditch? Why then would they say, "It was all along of us?" when it was owing to themselves and their priests, their blind pro∣phets, that followed their own spirits, and could foresee nothing of these times and things that are come upon them, which we had long forewarned them of; as Jeremi∣ah and Christ had forewarned Jerusalem. They thought to have wearied us out and undone us; but they undid themselves. Whereas we could praise God, notwithstand∣ing all their plundering of us, that we had a kettle, a platter, an horse, and plough still.</Q></P>
<P>Many ways were these professors warned, by word, by writing, and by signs; but they would believe none till it was too late. William Sympson was moved of the Lord to go at several times for three years naked and bare-footed before them, as a sign to them, in markets, courts, towns, cities, to priests houses, and to great men's houses; telling them, <Q>So should they be stripped naked as he was stripped naked!</Q> And sometimes he was moved to put on hair∣sackcloth, and to besmear his face, and to tell them, <Q>So would the Lord God besmear all their religion as he was besmeared.</Q> Great sufferings did that poor man under∣go, sore whippings with horse-whips and coach-whips on his bare body, grievous stoning and imprisonments in three
<PB N="430" REF="037441_0507_100D914DF283A018"/>years time, before the king came in, that they might have taken warning; but they would not, and rewarded his love with cruel usage. Only the mayor of Cambridge did nobly to him, for he put his gown about him, and took him into his house.</P>
<P>Another friend, Robert Huntingdon, was moved of the Lord to go into Carlisle steeple-house with a white sheet about him, amongst the great Presbyterians and Indepen∣dents there, to shew them that the surplice was coming up again; and he put an halter about his neck to shew them that an halter was coming upon them; which was fulfilled upon some of our persecutors not long after.</P>
<P>Another, Richard Sale, living near Westchester, being constable of the place where he lived, had a friend sent to him with a pass (whom those wicked professors had taken up for a vagabond, because he travelled up and down in the work of the ministry) and this constable, being convinced by the friend thus brought to him, gave him his pass and li∣berty, and was afterwards himself cast into prison. After this, on a lecture-day, Richard Sale was moved to go to the steeple-house in the time of their worship, and to carry those persecuting priests and people a lanthorn and candle, as a figure of their darkness; but they cruelly abused him, and like dark professors as they were put him into their prison cal∣led Little Ease, and so squeezed his body therein that not long after he died. Many warnings of divers sorts were friends moved in the power of the Lord to give unto that generation; which they not only rejected, but abused friends, calling us giddy-headed Quakers, but God brought his judgments upon those persecuting priests and magistrates. For when the king came in, most of them were turned out of their places and benefices, the spoilers were spoiled; and then we could ask them, Who were the giddy-heads now? Then many confessed we had been true prophets to the na∣tion, and said, Had we cried against some priests only they should have liked us then; but we crying against all, that made them dislike us. But now they saw that those priests, then looked upon to be the best, were as bad as the rest. For indeed some of those that were counted the most eminent priests were the bitterest and greatest stirrers up of the ma∣gistrates to persecution, and it was a judgment upon them to be denied the free liberty of their consciences when the king came in, because when they were uppermost they would not have liberty of conscience granted to others. One
<PB N="431" REF="037441_0508_100D914FDD63E530"/>Hewes, of Plymouth, a priest of great note in Oliver's days, when some liberty was granted, prayed, <Q>That God would put it into the hearts of the chief magistrates of the nation to remove this cursed Toleration.</Q> Others of them pray∣ed against it by the name of Intolerable Toleration. But a∣while after, when the king was come in, and priest Hewes turned out of his great benefice for not conforming to the Common Prayer, a friend from Plymouth meeting with him, asked him, <Q>Whether he would account Toleration accursed now? And whether he would not now be glad of a Toleration?</Q> To which the priest returned no answer, save by the shaking of his head. But as stiff as this sort of men were then against Toleration, it is well known many of them petit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned the king for Toleration and for meeting-places, and paid for licences too. But to return to the pre∣sent time, the latter end of the year 1660 and the beginning of 1661.</P>
<P>Although those friends, who had been imprisoned upon the rising of those Monarchy-men, were set at liberty, yet meetings were much disturbed, and great sufferings friends underwent; for besides what was done by officers and soldi∣ers, many wild fellows and rude people often came in. There came one time, when I was at Pall-mall, an ambassa∣dor with a company of Irishmen with rude fellows: the meeting was over before they came, and I was gone up in∣to a chamber, where I heard one of them say, he would 'kill all the Quakers.' I went down to him, and was mov∣ed in the power of the Lord to speak to him. I told him, the law said, 'An eye for an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and a tooth for a tooth;' but thou threatenest to <Q>kill all the Quakers, though they have done thee no hurt.</Q> But, said I, here is gospel for thee: <Q>Here's my hair, here's my cheek, here's my shoul∣der,</Q> turning it to him. This came so over him, that he and his companions stood as men amazed, and said, If that was our principle, and if we were as we said, they never saw the like in their lives. I told them, What I was in words, I was the same in life. Then the ambassador who had stood without, came in; for he said, that Irish colonel was such a desperate man, he durst not come in with him for fear he should have done us some mischief; but truth came over him, and he carried himself lovingly towards us, as also did the ambassador; for the Lord's power was over them all.</P>
<P>At Mile-end friends were kept out of their meeting-place
<PB N="432" REF="037441_0509_100D91516C305120"/>by soldiers; but friends stood nobly in the truth, valiant for the Lord's name, and at last the truth gave them dominion.</P>
<P>About this time we had an account that John Love, a friend that was moved to go and bear testimony against the idolatry of the Papists, was dead in prison at Rome: it was suspected he was privately put to death. John Perrot was also prisoner there, and being released came over again; but after his arrival here, he, with Charles Baily and some others, turned aside from the unity of friends and truth. Whereupon I was moved to give forth a paper, declaring how the Lord would blast him and his followers, if they did not repent and return, and that they should wither like the grass on the house-top; which many of them did: but others repented and returned.</P>
<P>Also before this time we received account from New-England, <Q>That the government there had made a law to banish the Quakers out of their colonies, upon pain of death in case they returned; that several of our friends, having been so banished and returning, were thereupon taken and actually hanged, and that divers more were in prison, in danger of the like sentence to be executed upon them.</Q> When those were put to death, I was in prison at Lancaster, and had a perfect sense of their sufferings as though it had been myself, and as though the halter had been put about my own neck, though we had not at that time heard of it. But as soon as we heard of it, Edward Burrough went to the king, and told him, <Q>There was a vein of innocent blood opened in his dominions, which if it were not stopped would over-run all.</Q> To which the king replied, 'But I will stop that vein.' Edward Bur∣rough said, <Q>Then do it speedily, for we know not how many may soon be put to death.</Q> The king answered, <Q>As speedily as ye will. Call (said he to some present) the secretary, and I will do it presently.</Q> The secretary being called, a mandamus was forthwith granted. A day or two after, Edward Burrough going again to the king to desire the matter might be expedited, the king said, He had no occasion at present to send a ship thither, but if we would send one we might do it as soon as we would. Ed∣ward then asked the king, If it would please him to grant his deputation to one called a Quaker to carry the manda∣mus to New-England? He said, 'Yes, to whom ye will.' Whereupon E. B. named Samuel Shattock, who being an inhabitant of New-England was banished by their law, to
<PB N="433" REF="037441_0510_100D915306B7F0B0"/>be hanged if he came again, and to him the deputation was granted. Then he sent for Ralph Goldsmith, an honest friend, who was master of a good ship, and ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed with him for three hundred pounds (goods or no goods) to sail in ten days. He forthwith prepared to set sail, and with a pros∣perous gale, in about six weeks time, arrived before the town of Boston in New-England, upon a first-day morning. With him went many passengers, both of New and Old England, friends, whom the Lord moved to go to bear their testimony against those bloody persecutors, who had exceeded all the world in that age in their bloody persecutions. The townsmen at Boston, seeing a ship come into the bay with English colours, soon came on board and asked for the cap∣tain. Ralph Goldsmith told him. He was the command∣er. They asked him, If he had any letters? He said, Yes. They asked, If he would deliver them? He said, 'No, not to-day.' So they went ashore, and reported, There was a ship full of Quakers, and that Samuel Shat∣tock was among them, who they knew was by their law to be put to death for coming again after banishment; but they knew not his errand nor his authority. So all being kept close that day, and none of the ship's company suf∣fered to go on shore; next morning Samuel Shattock, the king's deputy, and Ralph Goldsmith, went on shore, and sending back to the ship the men that landed them, they two went through the town to the governor's, John Endi∣cott's door, and knocked. He sent out a man to know their business. They sent him word their business was from the king of England, and they would deliver their message to none but the governor himself. Thereupon they were ad∣mitted in, and the governor came to them; and having re∣ceived the deputation and the mandamus, he put off his hat and looked upon them. Then going out, he bid the friends follow him. He went to the deputy-governor, and after a short consultation came out to the friends, and said, 'We shall obey his majesty's commands.' After this the master gave liberty to the passengers to come on shore, and presently the noise of the business flew about the town; and the friends of the town and the passengers of the ship me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> together to offer up their praises and thanksgivings to God, who had so wonderfully delivered them from the teeth of the devourer. While they were thus met, in came a poor friend, who, being sentenced by their bloody law to die, had lain some time in irons expecting execution. This
<PB N="434" REF="037441_0511_100D915599531010"/>added to their joy, and caused them to lift up their hearts in high praises to God, who is worthy for ever to have the praise, the glory, and the honour; for he only is able to deliver, to save, and support all that sincerely put their trust in him. Here follows a copy of the mandamus.</P>

<P>Some time after this several New-England magistrates came over, with one of their priests. We had several dis∣courses with them concerning their murdering our friends,
<PB N="435" REF="037441_0512_100D7F8567D89B78"/>the servants of the Lord; but they were ashamed to stand to their bloody actions. At one of those meetings I asked Simon Broadstreet, one of the New-England magistrates, Whether he had not an hand in putting to death those four servants of God, whom they hanged for being Quakers only, as they had nicknamed them? He confessed, He had. I then asked him, and the rest of his associates then present, Whether they would acknowledge themselves to be subjects to the laws of England? And if they did, by what law they had put our friends to death? They said, They were subjects to the laws of England, and they had put our friends to death by the same law as the Jesuits were put to death here in England. I asked them then, Whether they did believe those friends of ours, whom they had put to death, were Jesuits or jesuitically affected? They said, Nay. Then, said I, ye have murdered them, if ye have put them to death by the law that Jesuits are put to death here in England, and yet confess they were no Jesuits.' By this it plainly appears ye have put them to death in your own wills, without any law. Then Simon Broadstreet, finding himself and his company ensnared by their own words, said, Did we come to catch them? I told them, they had catched themselves, and they might justly be questioned for their lives; and if the father of William Ro∣binson (who was one of those that were put to death) was in town, it was probable he would question them, and bring their lives into jeopardy. Hereupon they began to excuse themselves, saying, <Q>There was no persecution now amongst them;</Q> but next morning we had letters from New-England, giving us account that our friends were per∣secuted there afresh. Thereupon we went to them again, and shewed them our letters, which put them both to silence and to shame. In great fear they seemed to be, lest some should call them to account and prosecute them for their lives, especially Simon Broadstreet; for he had at first be∣fore so many witnesses confessed, <Q>He had a hand in put∣ting our friends to death,</Q> that he could not get from it; though he afterwards through fear shuffled, and would have unsaid it again. After this he and the rest soon left the city, and got back to New-England again. I went also to go∣vernor Winthorp, and discoursed with him about these matters; but he assured me, <Q>He had no hand in putting our friends to death, or in any way persecuting of them, but was one of them that protested against it.</Q> These
<PB N="436" REF="037441_0513_100D915997B050D8"/>stingy persecutors of New-England were a people that fled out of Old England thither from the persecution of the bishops here; but when they had got power into their hands, they so far exceeded the bishops in severity and cru∣elty, that whereas the bishops had made them pay twelve pence a Sunday (so called) for not coming to their worship here, they imposed a fine of five shillings a day upon such as should not conform to their will-worship there, and spoil∣ed the goods of friends that could not pay it. Besides, many they imprisoned, divers they whipped, and that most cruelly; they cut the ears off some, and some they hanged: as the books of friends sufferings in New-England largely shew, particularly one written by George Bishop of Bristol, intituled, New-England judged: (in two parts.) Some of the old Royalists were earnest with friends to have pro∣secuted them; but we told them, we left them to the Lord, to whom vengeance belonged, and he would repay it. And the judgments of God have since fallen heavy on them; for the Indians have been raised up against them, and have cut off many of them.</P>
<P>About this time I lost a very good book, being taken in the printer's hands: it was a useful, teaching book, con∣taining the signification and explanation of Names, Para∣bles, Types, and Figures in the scriptures. Those who took it were so affected therewith that they were loth to destroy it; but thinking to have made a great advantage of it, they would have let us had it again, if we would have given them a great sum of money for it; which we were not free to do.</P>
<P>Before this, while I was prisoner in Lancaster castle, the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k called the Battledore came forth, which was written to shew that in all languages Thou and Thee is the proper and usual form of speech to a single person, and You to more than one. This was set forth in examples or instances taken out of the scriptures, and out of books of instruction in about thirty languages. John Stubbs and Benjamin Furly took great pains in compiling it, which I put them upon; and some things I added to it. When it was finish∣ed, some of them were presented to the king and his coun∣cil, to the bishops of Canterbury and London, and to the two universities one apiece; and many bought of them. The king said, 'It was the proper language of all nations.' The bishop of Canterbury, being asked what he thought of it, was so at a stand that he could not tell what to say to
<PB N="437" REF="037441_0514_100D915BA8866F78"/>it. For it did so inform and convince people, that few afterwards were so rugged towards us for saying Thou and Thee to a single person, which before they were exceeding fierce against us for. For Thou and Thee was a sore cut to proud flesh, and them that sought self-honour; who, though they would say it to God and Christ, would not endure to have it said to themselves. So that we were often beat and abused, and sometimes in danger of our lives for using those words to some proud men, who would say, 'What! you ill-bred clown, do you Thou me!' as though there lay christian breeding in saying You to one, which is contrary to their grammars and teaching books, by which they instructed their youth.</P>
<P>Now the bishops and priests being busy and eager to set up their form of worship, and compel all to come to it, I was moved to give forth the following paper, to open the nature of the true worship which Christ set up, and which God accepts; thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST's worship is free in the Spirit to all men; and such as worship in the Spirit and in the truth are those that God seeks to worship him; for he is the God of truth, and is a Spirit, and the God of the spirits of all flesh. He hath given to all nations of men and wo∣men breath and life, to live, move, and have their being in him, and hath put into them an immortal soul. So all nations of men and women are to be temples for him to dwell in; and they that defile his temple will he destroy. Now as the outward Jews, while they had their outward temple a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jerusalem, were to go thither to worship (which temple God hath long since thrown down, and destr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that Jerusalem, the vision of peace, and cast off the Jews and their worship, and in the room thereof hath set up his gospel-worship in the Spirit and in the truth) so now all are to worship in the Spirit and in the truth. This is a free worship; for where the Spirit of the Lord is and ruleth, there is liberty; the fruits of the Spirit are seen, and will manifest themselves; and the Spirit is not to be limited, but to be lived and walked in, that the fruits of it may appear. The tares are such as hang upon the wheat, and thereby draw it down to the earth; yet the tares and the wheat must grow together till the harvest, lest they that take upon them to pluck up the tares should pluck up the wheat with the tares. The tares are such as worship
<PB N="438" REF="037441_0515_100D915E44189580"/>not God in the Spirit and in the truth, but grieve the Spirit, vex and quench it in themselves, and walk not in the truth; yet will hang about the wheat, the true wor∣shippers in the Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in the truth. Christ's church was never established by blood, nor held up by prisons; neither was the foundation of it laid by carnal armed men, nor is it preserved by such. When men went from the Spirit and truth, they took up carnal weapons to maintain their outward forms, and yet cannot preserve them with their carnal weapons; for one plucketh down another's form with his outward weapons. And this work hath been among the Christians in name since they lost the Spirit, and spiritual weapons, and the true worship which Christ set up, that is in the Spirit and in the truth; which Spirit and truth they that worship in are over all the tares. All that would be plucking up the tares are forbidden by Christ, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; for the tares and the wheat must grow together till the harvest, as Christ hath commanded. The stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and silled the whole earth: now if the stone do fill the whole earth, all nations must be temples for the stone. All that say they travail for the seed, and yet bring forth nothing but a birth of strife, contention, and confusion, their fruit shews their travail to be wrong; for by the fruit the end of every one's work is seen of what sort it is.</P>

<P>About this time many Papists and Jesuits be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n to fawn upon friends, and talked up and down where they came, that of all the sects the Quakers were the best and most self∣denying people; and said, <Q>It was great pity that they did not return to the holy mother church.</Q> Thus they made a buzz among the people, and said, <Q>They would willingly discourse with friends.</Q> But friends were loth to meddle with them, because they were Jesuits, looking upon it to be both dangerous and scandalous. But when I under∣stood it, I said to friends, <Q>Let us discourse with them, be they what they will.</Q> So a time being appointed at Ger∣rard Roberts's, there came two of them like courtiers. They asked our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames, which we told them; but we did not ask their nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, for we understood they were called Papists, and they knew we were called Quakers. I asked them the same question that I had formerly asked a Jesuit, namely,
<PB N="439" REF="037441_0516_100D9160305B8058"/><Q>Whether the church of Rome was not degenerated from the church in the primitive times, from the Spirit, power, and practice that they were in in the apostles times?</Q> He to whom I put this question, being subtle, said, <Q>He would not answer it.</Q> I asked him, Why? But he would shew no reason. His companion said, he would answer me; and said, <Q>They were not degenerated from the church in the primitive times.</Q> I asked the other, <Q>Whether he was of the same mind? He said, Yes. Then I replied, for the better understanding one another, and that there might be no mistake, I would repeat my question over again after this manner: Whether the church of Rome now was in the same purity, practice, power, and Spirit, that the church in the apostles time was in?</Q> When they saw we would be exact with them, they flew off, and denied that, saying, <Q>It was presumption in any to say they had the same power and Spirit which the apostles had.</Q> I told them, It was presumption in them to meddle with the words of Christ and his apostles, and make people believe they succeeded the apostles, yet be forced to confess, <Q>They were not in the same power and Spirit that the apostles were in:</Q> This, said I, is a spirit of presumption, and rebuked by the apostles Spirit. I shewed them how different their fruits and practices were from the fruits and practices of the apos∣tles. Then got up one of them, and said, <Q>Ye are a com∣pany of dreamers.</Q> Nay, said I, ye are the filthy dream∣ers, who dream ye are the apostles successors, and yet con∣fess, <Q>Ye have not the same power and Spirit which the apostles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere in.</Q> And are not they defilers of the flesh, who say, <Q>It is presumption for any to say, they have the same power and Spirit which the apostles had?</Q> Now, said I, if ye have not the same power and Spirit which the apostles had, then it is manifest that ye are led by another power and spirit than the apostles and church in the primi∣tive times were led by. Then I began to tell them how that evil spirit, which they were led by, had led them to pray by beads and to images, and to set up nunneries, fria∣ries, and monasteries, and to put people to death for reli∣gion; which practice I shewed them was below the law, and far short of the gospel, in which is liberty. They were soon weary of this discourse, and went their way, and gave a charge, as we heard, to the Papists, <Q>That they should not dispute with us, nor read any of our books.</Q> So we were rid of them; but we had reasonings with all the other
<PB N="440" REF="037441_0517_100D9161C52A72E0"/>sects, Presbyterians, Independents, Seekers, Baptists, Epis∣copal-men Socinians, Brownists, Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, Fifth-monarchy-men, Familists, Muggletonians, and Ranters; none of which would affirm they had the same power and Spirit that the apostles had and were in; so in that power and Spirit the Lord gave us dominion over them all.</P>
<P>As for the Fifth-monarchy-men I was moved to give forth a paper, to manifest their error to them; for they look∣ed for Christ's personal coming in an outward form and manner, and fixed the time to the year 1666; at which time some of them prepared themselves when it thundered and rained, thinking Christ was then come to set up his king∣dom, and they imagined they were to kill the whore with∣out them. But I told them the whore was alive in them, and was not burned with God's fire, nor judged in them with the same power and Spirit the apostles were in. And their looking for Christ's coming outwardly to set up his kingdom, was like the Pharisees 'Lo here,' and 'Lo there.' But Christ was come and had set up his kingdom above sixteen hundred years ago (according to Nebuchadnezzar's dream and Daniel's prophecy) and he had dashed to pieces the four monarchies, the great image, with its head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron part of clay; and they were all blown away with God's wind, as the chaff in the summer threshing-floor. And when Christ was on earth, he said, His kingdom was not of this world: if it had, his servants would have fought; but it was not, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> servants did not fight. Therefore all the Fifth-monarchy men, that are fighters with carnal weapons, are none of Christ's serv∣ants, but the beast's and the whore's. Christ said, <Q>All power in heaven and in earth is given to me;</Q> so then his kingdom was set up above sixteen hundred years ago, and he reigns. And we see Jesus Christ reign, said the apostle, and he shall reign till all things be put under his feet; tho' all things are not yet put under his feet, nor subdued.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OR HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRAVELS, SUFFERINGS, &amp;c. OF GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS year several friends were moved to go beyond sea, to publish truth in foreign countries. John Stubbs, Henry Fell, and Richard Costrop were moved to go towards China and Prester John's country; but no masters of ships would carry them. With much ado they got a warrant from the king; but the East-India company found ways to avoid it, and the masters of their ships would not carry them. Then they went into Holland, hoping to have got passage there; but no passage could they get there neither. Then John Stubbs and Henry Fell took shipping for Alexandria in Egypt, intending to go by the caravans from thence. Meanwhile Daniel Baker being to go to Smyrna, drew Richard Costrop, contrary to his own free∣dom, along with them; and in the passage, Richard falling sick, D. Baker left him sick in the ship; where he died: but that hard-hearted man afterwards lost his own condition.</P>
<P>John Stubbs and Henry Fell got to Alexandria; but they had not been long there before the English consul banished them from thence; yet before they came away, they dispersed many books and papers for the opening the principles and way of truth to the Turks and Grecians.
<PB N="4" REF="037441_0520_100D9165F4571FC8"/>They gave the book called, 'The Pope's strength broken,' to an old friar, for him to give or send to the pope; which book, when the friar had perused, he clapped his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up∣on his breast, and confessed, <Q>What was written therein was truth; but,</Q> said he, <Q>if I should confess it openly, they would burn me.</Q> John Stubbs and Henry Fell, not being suffered to go farther, returned to England, and came to London again. John had a vision that the English and Dutch, who had joined together not to carry them, <Q>would fall out one with the other.</Q> And so it came to pass.</P>
<P>Having staid in London some time. I felt drawings to visit friends in Essex. I went to Colchester, where I had very large meetings, and from thence to Coggeshall; not far from which there was a priest convinced, and I had a meeting at his house. So travelling a little in those parts, visiting friends in their meetings, I returned pretty quickly to London, where I sound great service for the Lord; for a large door was opened, many slocked in to our meetings, and the Lord's truth spread mightily this year. Yet friends had great travail and fore labour, the rude people having been so heightened by the Monarchy-men's rising a little before. But the Lord's power was over all, and in it friends had dominion though we had not only those sufferings without, but sufferings within also, by John Perrot and his company; who giving heed to a spirit of delusion, sought to introduce among friends that evil and uncomely practice of 'keeping on the hat in the time of publick prayers.' Friends had spoken to him and divers of his followers about it, and I had written to them concerning it; but he and some others rather strengthened themselves against us. Wherefore feeling the judgment of truth rise against it, I gave forth the following lines, as a warning to all concerned therein.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>WHOSOEVER is tainted with this spirit of John Perrot, it will perish. Mark theirs and his end, that are turned into those outward things and janglings about them, and that which is not savoury; all which is for perpetual judgment, and is to be swept and cleansed out of the camp of God's elect. This is to that spirit that is gone into jangling about that which is below (the rotten principle of the old Ranters) gone from the invisible pow∣er of God, in which is the everlasting fellowship; so ma∣ny are become like the corn on the house-top, and like
<PB N="5" REF="037441_0521_100D9168D55040C8"/>the untimely figs, who now clamour and speak against them that are in the power of God. Oh! consider! the light and power of God goes over you all, and leaves you in the fretting nature, out of the unity which is in the everlasting light, life, and power of God. Consider this before the day be gone from you, and take heed that your memorial be not rooted out from among the righteous.</P>

<P>Among the exercises and troubles that friends had from without, one was concerning friends marriages, which some∣times were called in question. In this year there happened to be a cause tried at the assize at Nottingham concerning a friend's marriage. The case was thus: Some years before two friends were joined together in marriage amongst friends, and lived together as man and wife about two years. Then the man died, leaving his wife with child, and leaving an est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in lands of copyhold. When the woman was deli∣vered, the jury presented the child heir to its father's lands, and accordingly the child was admitted; afterwards another friend married the widow. And after that, a person near of kin to her former husband, brought his action against the friend who had last married her, endeavouring to dispossess them, and deprive the child of the inheritance, and to pos∣sess himself thereof, as next heir to the woman's first hus∣band. To effect this, he endeavoured to prove the child illegitimate, alleging, <Q>The marriage was not according to law.</Q> In opening the cause, the plaintiff's counsel used unseemly words concerning friends, saying, <Q>they went to∣gether like brute beasts,</Q> with other ill expressions. After the counsel on both sides had pleaded, the judge, (viz. judge Archer) took the matter in hand, and opened it to them, telling them, <Q>There was a marriage in paradise when Adam took Eve, and Eve took Adam, and that it was the consent of the parties that made a marriage. And for the Quakers (he said) he did not know their opinions; but he did not believe they went together as brute beasts, as had been said of them, but as Christians; and therefore he did believe the marriage was lawful, and the child lawful heir.</Q> The better to satisfy the jury, he brought them a case to this purpose, <Q>A man that was weak of body, and kept his bed, had a desire in that condition to marry, and did declare before witnesses, that he did take such a woman to be his wife, and the woman declared that she took that
<PB N="6" REF="037441_0522_100D916A64FEC788"/>man to be her husband. This marriage was afterwards called in question, (and as the judge said) all the bishops did conclude it to be a lawful marriage.</Q> Hereupon the jury gave in their verdict for the friend's child against the man that would have deprived it of its inheritance.</P>
<P>About this time the oaths of allegiance and supremacy were tendered to friends as a snare, because it was known we could not swear, and thereupon many were imprisoned, and divers premunired. Upon that occasion friends pub∣lished in print, <Q>The grounds and reasons why they resused to swear;</Q> besides which, I was moved to give forth these few lines following, to be given to the magistrates:</P>

There have been also imprisoned in thy name, since thy arrival, by such as thought to ingratiate themselves thereby with thee, "three thousand sixty and eight persons." Besides this, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eetings are daily broken up by men with clubs and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (though we meet peaceably, according to the practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God's people in the primitive times) our friends are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into waters, and trod upon till the very blood gush <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>out of them; the number of which abuses can hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> uttered.

One of the greatest things that we have suffered for formerly, was because we could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot swear to the protectors and all the changeable govern∣ments; and now we are imprisoned because we cannot take the oath of allegiance. Now, if Yea be Yea, and Nay Nay, to thee, and to all men upon the earth, let us suffer as much for breaking of that as others do for break∣ing an oath. We have suffered these many years both in lives and estates under these changeable governments, be∣cause we cannot swear, but obey Christ's doctrine, who commands "we should not swear at all," Matth. v. James v. and this we seal with our lives and estates, with our Yea and Nay, according to the doctrine of Christ. Hear∣ken to these things, and so consider them in the wisdom of thy God, that by it such actions may be stopped; thou that hast the government, and may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st do it. We desire all that are in prison may be set at liberty, and that for the time to come they may not be imprisoned for con∣science and for the truth's sake.

<P>There were two of our friends in prison in the inquisi∣tion at Malta, both women; Catherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. I was told that one called the Lord D'Aubeny could procure their liberty; wherefore I went to him: and having informed him concerning their imprisonment, desir∣ed him to write to the magistrates there for their release. He readily promised me he would; and said, <Q>If I would come again within a month he would acquaint me of their dis∣charge.</Q> I went again about that time, and he said, <Q>He
<PB N="9" REF="037441_0525_100D9170F4A1DC98"/>thought his letters had miscarried, because he had received no answer.</Q> But he promised he would write again, and did so; whereupon they were set at liberty.</P>
<P>With this great man I had a great deal of reasoning about religion, and he confessed that <Q>Christ hath enlight∣ened every man that cometh into the world with his spiri∣tual light; that he had tasted death for every man: that the Grace of God, which brings salvation, hath appeared to all men; and that it would teach them, and bring their salvation, if they did obey it.</Q> I asked him, What would they (the Papists) do with all their relicks and images, if they should own and believe in this light, and receive the grace to teach them and bring their salvation? He said, <Q>Those things were but policies to keep people in subjec∣tion.</Q> Very free he was in discourse. I never heard a Papist confess so much as he did. Tho' several about the court began to grow kind to friends, yet the persecution was very hot, and several friends died in prison. Whereupon I gave forth a little paper concerning the grounds and rise of persecution; which was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL the sufferings of the people of God in all ages were because they could not join to the national re∣ligions and worships which men have made and set up, and because they would not forsake God's religion and his worship which he had set up. You may see through all chronicles and histories, that the priests joined with the powers of the nations; the magistrates, sooth-sayers, and fortune-tellers, all joined against the people of God, and did imagine vain things against them in their councils. When the Jews did wickedly, they turned against Moses; when the Jewish kings transgressed the law of God, they persecuted the prophets; as may be seen in the prophets writings. When Christ, the substance, came, the Jews persecuted Christ, his apostles, and disciples. And when the Jews had not power enough of themselves to persecute answerable to their wills, then they got the heathen Gen∣tiles to help them against Christ, and against his apostles and disciples, who were in the Spirit and power of Christ.</P>

<P>After I had made some stay in London, and had cleared myself of what lay upon me there, I went into the country, having with me Alexander Parker and John Stubbs. We
<PB N="10" REF="037441_0526_100D9172F1BE9A98"/>travelled through the country, visiting friends meetings, till we came to Bristol. There we understood, that the officers were likely to come and break up the meeting; yet on first-day we went to the meeting at Broad-mead, and Alexander Parker standing up first, while he was speaking, the officers came and took him away. After he was gone, I stood up and declared the everlasting truth of the Lord God in his eternal power, which came over all, and the meeting was quiet the rest of the time, and broke up peaceably. I tarried till first-day following, visiting friends, and being visited by friends. On first-day morning several friends came to Ed∣ward Pyot's (where I lay the night before) and used endea∣vours to persuade me not to go to the meeting that day; for the magistrates had threatened to take me, and had rais∣ed the trained-bands. I wished them to go to the meeting, not telling them what I intended to do; but I told Edward Pyot I intended to go, and he sent his son to shew me the way from his house by the fields. As I went I met divers friends, who did what they could to stop me: 'What,' said one, 'wilt thou go into the mouth of the beast?' 'Wilt thou go into the mouth of the dragon?' said another. I put them by and went on. When I came to the meet∣ing, Margaret Thomas was speaking. When she had done, I stood up. I saw a concern and fear upon friends for me; but the power of the Lord, in which I declared, soon struck the fear out of them. Life sprang, and an heavenly glori∣ous meeting we had. After I had cleared myself of what was upon me from the Lord to the meeting, I was moved to pray, and after prayer to stand up again, and tell friends, <Q>Now they might see there was a God in Israel that could deliver.</Q> A very large meeting this was, and very hot; but truth was over all, and the life was exalted which car∣ried through all, and the meeting broke up in peace. The officers and soldiers had been breaking up another meeting, which had taken up their time; so that our meeting was ended before they came. But I understood afterwards they were in a great rage, because they had missed me; for they were heard to say one to another before, <Q>I'll warrant we shall have him;</Q> but the Lord prevented them. I went to Joan Hily's, where many friends came to see me; re∣joicing and blessing God for our deliverance. In the even∣ing I had a fine fresh meeting at a friend's house over the water, where we were much refreshed in the Lord. After this I staid most part of that week in Bristol, and at Ed∣ward
<PB N="11" REF="037441_0527_100D9174B541F4F8"/>Pyot's. Edward was brought so low and weak with an ague, that when I first came he was looked upon as a dying man; but it pleased the Lord to raise him up again, so that, before I went away, his ague left him, and he was sinely well.</P>
<P>Having been two first-days at the meeting at Broad∣mead. and feeling my spirit clear of Bristol. I went next first-day to a meeting in the country not far distant. And after the meeting. some friends from Bristol told me, the soldiers that day had beset the meeting-house round at Bris∣tol, and then went up, saying. <Q>They would be sure to have me now;</Q> but when they found me not there, they were in a great rage, and kept friends in the meeting-house most part of the day before they would let them go home; and queried of them, Which way I was gone, and how 'they might send after me? For the mayor,' they said, 'would fain have spoken with me.' I had a vision of a great mastiff dog, that would have bit me; but I put one hand above his jaws, and the other hand below, and tore his jaws in pieces. So the Lord by his power tore their power to pieces, and made way for me to escape them. Then I passed through the country, visiting friends in Wilt∣shire and Berkshire, till I came to London, having great meetings amongst friends as I went. The Lord's power was over all, and a blessed time it was for the spreading of his glorious truth. It was indeed the immediate power of the Lord that preserved me out of their hands at Bristol, and over the heads of all our persecutors; and the Lord alone is worthy of all the glory, who did uphold and pre∣serve for his name and truth's sake.</P>
<P>At London I staid not long, being drawn in spirit to visit friends northward as far as Leicestershire. John Stubbs was with me. We travelled down, having meetings amongst friends as we went; and at Skegby we had a great meet∣ing. Thence we came to Barnet-hills, where lived captain Brown, a Baptist, whose wife was convinced of truth. This captain Brown, after the act for 'breaking up meetings' came forth, being afraid his wife should go to meetings, and be cast into prison, left his house at Barrow, and took a place on these hills, saying, 'His wife should not go to prison.' And this being a free place, many priests and others fled thither as well as he. But he, who would neither stand to truth himself nor suffer his wife, was in this place, where he thought himself safe, found out by the Lord, whose hand
<PB N="12" REF="037441_0528_100D9176B17894D0"/>fell heavy upon him for his unfaithfulness; so that he was sorely plagued, and grievously judged in himself for flying and drawing his wife into that private place. We went to see his wife, and being in the house, I asked him, how he did? 'How do I!' said he, <Q>The plagues and vengeance of God are upon me, a runagate, a Cain as I am. God may look for a witness for me, and such as me; for if all were not faithfuller than I, God would have no witness left in the earth.</Q> In this condition he lived on bread and water, and thought it was too good for him. At length he got home again with his wife to his own house at Barrow, where afterwards he was convinced of God's eternal truth, and died in it. A little before his death he said, <Q>Though he had not borne a testimony for truth in his life, he would bear a testimony in his death, and would be buried in his orchard;</Q> and was so. He was an example to all the flying Baptists in the time of persecution, who could not bear persecution themselves, yet persecuted us when they had power.</P>
<P>From Barnet-hills we came to Swanington, in Leicester∣shire, where William Smith and some, other friends visited me; but went away towards night, leaving me at a friend's house in Swanington. At night, as I was sitting in the hall, speaking to a widow-woman and her daughter, lord Beaumont came with a company, of soldiers, who, slapping their swords on the door, rushed into the house with swords and pistols in their hands, crying, <Q>Put out the candles, and make fast the doors.' Then they seized upon the friends in the house, and asked, If there were no more about the house?</Q> The friends told them, there was one man more in the hall. There being some friends out of Derbyshire, one of them was named Thomas Fauks; lord Beaumont, after he had asked all their names, bid his man set down that man's name Thomas Fox. The friend said, Nay, his name was not Fox, but Fauks. In the mean time some of the soldiers came, and fetched me out of the hall to him. He asked my name. I told him my name was George Fox, and that I was well known by that name. 'Aye,' said he, 'you are known all the world over.' I said, I was known for no hurt, but for good. Then he put his hands into my pockets to search them, and plucked out my comb-case, and afterwards commanded one of his offi∣cers to search further for letters. I told him, I was no let∣ter-carrier, and asked him, Why he came amongst a peace∣able
<PB N="13" REF="037441_0529_100D917998752778"/>people with swords and pistols, without a constable, contrary to the king's proclamation and to the late act? For he could not say, there was a meeting, I being only talking with a poor widow-woman and her daughter. By reasoning thus with him, he came somewhat down; yet sending for the constables, he gave them charge of us that night, and to bring us before him next morning. Accord∣ingly the constables set a watch of the town's people upon us that night, and had us next morning to his house about a mile from Swanington. When we came before him, he told us, 'We met contrary to the Act.' I desired him to shew us the act. 'Why,' says he, <Q>you have it in your pocket.</Q> I told him, he did not find us in a meeting. Then he asked, <Q>Whether we would take the oaths of alle∣giance and supremacy?</Q> I told him, I never took any oath in my life, nor engagement, nor the covenant. Yet still he would force the oath upon us. I desired him to shew us the oath, that we might see whether we were the persons it was to be tendered to, and whether it was not for the discovery of popish recusants. At length he brought a little book, but we called for the statute-book. He would not shew us that, but caused a mittimus to be made, which mentioned, 'That we were to have had a meeting.' With this mittimus he delivered us to the constables to convey us to Leicester gaol. But when the constables had brought us back to Swanington, being harvest-time, it was hard to get any body to go with us. The people were loth to take their neighbours to prison, especially in such a busy time. They would have given us our mittimus to have carried ourselves to the gaol; for it had been usual for constables to give friends their own mittimuses, and they have gone themselves with them to the gaoler. But we told them, though our friends had sometimes done so, we would not take this mittimus; but some of them should go with us to the gaol. At last they hired a poor labouring man, who was loth to go, though hired. So we rode to Leicester, being five in number; some carried their bible<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open in their hands, declaring truth to the people as we rode in the fields and through the towns, and telling them, <Q>We were prisoners of the Lord Jesus Christ, going to suffer bonds for his name and trutl sake.</Q> One woman friend carried her wheel on her lap to spin on in prison, and the people were mightily affected. At Leicester we went to an inn, The master of the house seemed to be troubled that we
<PB N="14" REF="037441_0530_100D917B28240FE0"/>should go to prison; and being himself in commission, he sent for lawyers in the town to advise with, and would have taken up the mittimus, and kept us in his own house, and not have let us gone into the gaol. But I told friends, it would be great charge to lie at an inn, many friends and people would come to visit us, and it might be hard for him to bear meetings in his house: besides, we had many friends in the prison already, and we had rather be with them. So we let the man know we were sensible of his kindness, and to prison we went; the poor man that brought us thither delivering both the mittimus and us to the gaoler. This gaoler had been a very wicked, cruel man. Six or seven friends being in prison before we came, he had taken some occasion to quarrel with them, and had thrust them into the dungcon amongst felons, where was hardly room for them to lie down. We staid all that day in the prison∣yard. and desired the gaoler to let us have some straw. He surlily answered, <Q>You do not look like men that would lie on straw.</Q> After awhile William Smith came to me, and being acquainted in the house, I asked him, What rooms were in the house, and what rooms friends had been usually put in before they were put into the dungeon? I asked him also, Whether the gaoler or his wife was master? He said, The wife was master; and though she was lame, and sate mostly in her chair, not being able to go but on crutches, yet she would beat her husband when he came within her reach, if he did not as she would have him. I considered that many friends might probably come to visit us, and if we had a room to ourselves, it would be better for them to speak to me, and for me to speak to them in, as there should be occasron. Wherefore I desired William Smith to speak with the woman, and acquaint her, if she would let us have a room, suffer our friends to come out of the dungeon, and leave it to us to give her what we would, it might be better for her. He went, and after some reasoning with her she consented; and we were had into a room. Then we were told, The gaoler would not suffer us to have any drink out of the town into the prison, but what beer we drank we must take of him. I told them, I would remedy that if they would; for we would get a pail of water, and a little wormwood once a day, and that might serve us; so we should have none of his beer, and the water he could not deny us.</P>
<P>Before we came, when those sew friends that were pri∣soners
<PB N="15" REF="037441_0531_100D917CC210F610"/>met together on first-days, if any of them was moved to pray to the Lord, the gaoler would come up with his quarter-staff in his hand, and his mastiff-dog at his heels, and pluck them down by the hair of the head, and strike them with his staff; but when he struck friends, the mastiff¦dog, instead of falling upon them, would take the staff out of his hand. When first-day came, I spoke to one of my fellow-prisoners to carr, a stool and set it in the yard, and give notice to the debtors and felons that there would be a meeting in the yard, and they that would hear the word of the Lord declared might come thither. So the prisoners gathered in the yard, and we went down and had a very precious meeting, the gaoler not meddling. Thus every first-day we had a meeting as long as we staid in prison, and several came out of the town and country. Many were convinced, and some received the Lord's truth there, who stood faithful witnesses for it ever since.</P>
<P>When the sessions came, we were brought before the jus∣tices, with more friends, to the number of about twenty. Being brought into the court, the gaoler put us in the place where the thieves were, and some of the justices began to tender the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to us. I told them, I never took any oath in my life; and they knew we could not swear, because Christ and his apostle forbad it: therefore they put it but as a snare to us. We told them, if they could prove, that after Christ and the apostle had forbid swearing, they did ever command Christians to swear, we would take these oaths; otherwise we were resolved to obey Christ's command and the apostle's exhortation. They said, <Q>We must take the oath, that we might manifest our allegiance to the king.</Q> I told them, I had been formerly sent prisoner by col. Hacker from that town to London, under pretence that I held meetings to plot to bring in king Charles. I also desired them to read our mittimus, which set forth the cause of our commitment to be, that 'we were to have a meeting;' and I said, lord Beaumont could not by that act send us to gaol, unless we had been taken at a meeting, and found to be such persons as the act speaks of; therefore we desired they would read the mitti∣mus, and see how wrongfully we were imprisoned. They would not take notice of the mittimus; but called a jury, and indicted us <Q>for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy.</Q> When the jury was sworn and instruct∣ed, as they were going out, one who had been an alderman
<PB N="16" REF="037441_0532_100D917EB9CA5B78"/>of the city bid them, 'Have a good conscience;' and one of the jury, being a peevish man, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the justices, there was one affronted the jury; whereupon they called him up, and tendered him the oath also, which he to.</P>
<P>While we were standing where the thieves used to stand, a cut-purse had his hand in several friends pockets. Friends declared it to the justices, and shewed them the man. They called him up before them, and upon examination he could not deny it; yet they set him at liberty.</P>
<P>It was not long before the jury returned, and brought us in guilty; and after some words, the justices whispered to∣gether, and bid the gaoler take us to prison again; but the Lord's power was over them, and his everlasting truth, which we declared boldly amongst them. There being a great concourse of people, most of them followed us; so that the crier and bailiffs were fain to call the people back again to the court. We declared the truth as we went along the streets, till we came to the gaol, the streets being full of people. When we were in our chamber again, after some time the gaoler came to us, and desired all to go forth that were not prisoners. When they were gone, he said, <Q>Gen∣tlemen, it is the court's pleasure that ye should be set at liberty, except those that are in for tithes: and you know there are fees due to me; but I shall leave it to you to give me what you will.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we were all set at liberty on a sudden, and passed every one into our services. Leonard Fell went with me again to Swanington. I had a letter from lord Hastings, who hearing of my imprisonment had wrote from London to the justices of the sessions to set me at liberty. I had not delivered this letter to the justices; but whether they had any knowledge of his mind from any other hand, which made them discharge us so suddenly, I know not. But his letter I carried to lord Beaumont, who sent us to prison; and when he had broke it open and read it, he seemed much troubled; but at last came a little lower; yet threatened us, if we had any more meetings at Swanington, he would break them up and fend us to prison again. But notwithstanding his threats we went to Swanington, and had a meeting with friends there, and he neither came nor sent to break it up.</P>
<P>From Swanington we came to Twy-cross, where that great man formerly mentioned, whom the Lord raised up from his sickness in the year 1649 (whose serving-man came at me with a drawn sword to have done me a mischief) and
<PB N="17" REF="037441_0533_100D9180B2199F60"/>his wife came to see me. From thence we travelled through Warwickshire, where we had brave meetings; and into Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire, visiting friends till we came to London.</P>
<P>I staid not long in London, but went into Essex, and so to Norsolk, having great meetings. At Norwich, when I came to captain Lawrence's, there was a great threatening of disturbance; but the meeting was quiet. Passing from thence to Sutton, and into Cambridgeshire, I heard of Ed∣ward Burrough's decease. And being sensible how great a grief and exercise it would be to friends to part with him, I wrote the following lines for the staying and settling of their minds.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>From thence I passed to Little-port and the Isle of Ely; where one that had been the mayor, with his wife, and the wife of the then present mayor of Cambridge, came to the meeting. Travelling into Lincolnshire and Huntingdon∣shire. I came to Thomas Parnel's, where the mayor of Hun∣tingdon came to see me, and was very loving. From thence I came into the Fen-country, where we had large and quiet meetings. While I was in that country, there came so great a flood, that it was dangerous to go out; yet we did get out, and went to Lynn, where we had a blessed meeting. Next morning I went to visit some prisoners there; then back to the inn, and took horse. As I was riding out of the yard, the officers came to search the inn for me. I knew nothing of it then, only I felt a great burden come upon me as I rode out of the town, till I was got without the gates. When some friends that came after overtook me, they told me their officers had been searching for me in the inn, as soon as I was gone out of the yard. So by the good hand of the Lord I escaped their cruel hands. After this we passed through the countries, visiting friends in their meetings.
<PB N="18" REF="037441_0534_100D9182F7F4BCD0"/>The Lord's power carried us over the persecuting spirits, and through many dangers; and his truth spread and grew, and friends were established therein: praises and glory to his name for ever!</P>
<P>Having passed through Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Hertfordshire, we came to London again; where I staid awhile, visiting friends in their meetings, which were very large, and the Lord's power was over all. After some time I left the city, and travelled into Kent, having Thomas Briggs with me. We went to Ashford, where we had a qui∣et and a very blessed meeting. On first-day we bad a very good and peaceable meeting at Cranbrook. Then we went to Tenterden, and had a meeting there, to which friends came from several parts; and many other people came in and were reached by the truth. When the meeting was done, I walked with Thomas Briggs into a close, while our horses were getting ready; and turning my head, I espied a captain coming, and a great company of soldiers with light∣ed matches and muskets. Some of the soldiers came to Tho∣mas and me, and said, 'We must go to their captain.' When they had brought us before him, he asked, <Q>Where was George Fox? Which was he? I said, I am the man.</Q> <Q>Then he came to me, and was somewhat struck, and said, I will secure you among the soldiers.</Q> So he called for the soldiers to take me. Then he took Thomas Briggs and the man of the house, with many more; but the power of the Lord was mightily over them all. Then he came to me again, and said, 'I must go along with him to the town;' and he carried himself pretty civilly, bidding the soldiers bring the rest after. As we walked, I asked him, <Q>Why they did thus? for I had not seen so much ado a great while;</Q> and I bid him be civil to his peaceable neighbours. When we were come to the town, they had us to an inn that was the gaoler's house. After awhile the mayor of the town, this captain, and the lieutenant, who were justi∣ces, came together and examined me, <Q>Why I came thither to make a disturbance?</Q> I told them, I did not come to make a disturbance, neither had I made any disturbance since I came. They said, <Q>There was a law against the Quakers meetings, made only against them.</Q> I told them, I knew no such law. Then they brought the act made against Qurakers and others. I told them, that was against such as were a <Q>terror to the king's subjects, who were ene∣mies, and held principles dangerous to the government;</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="037441_0535_100D9184906E67D8"/>and therefore it was not against us, for we held the truth; our principles were not dangerous, and our meeting were peaceable, as they knew, who knew their neighbours were a peaceable people. They told me, <Q>I was an enemy to the king.</Q> I answered, We loved all people, were enemies to none, and that I had been cast into Derby dungcon about the time of Worcester fight, because I would not take up arms against him; and that I was afterwards brought by colonel Hacker to London, as a plotter to bring in king Charles, and was kept prisoner at London till I was set at liberty by Oliver. They asked me, <Q>Whether I was im∣prisoned in the time of the insurrection?</Q> I said, Yes; I had been imprisoned then and since, and had been set at liberty by the king's own command. I opened the act to them, shewed them the king's late declaration, gave them the examples of other justices, and told them also what the house of lords had said of it. I spoke also to them con∣cerning their own conditions, exhorting them to live in the fear of God, to be tender towards their neighbours that fear∣ed God, and to mind God's wisdom by which all things were made and created, that they might come to receive it, be ordered by it, and by it order all things to God's glory. They demanded bond of us for our appearance at the ses∣sions; but we, pleading our innocency, refused to give bond. Then they would have us promise to come no more there; but we kept clear of that also. When they saw they could not bring us to their terms, they told us, <Q>We should see they were civil to us, for it was the mayor's pleasure we should all be set at liberty.</Q> I told them, their civility was noble; and so we parted.</P>
<P>Leaving Tenterden, we went to Newick in Sussex, where we visited some friends. From thence we passed through the country, sisiting friends, and having great meetings; all quiet and free from disturbance (except by some jangling Baptists) till we came into Hampshire. Where, after a good meeting at Southampton, we went to Pulner, in the parish of Ringwood, where was to be a monthly meeting next day, to which many friends resorted from Southampton, Pool, and other places; and the weather being very hot, some came pretty early in the morning. I took a friend, and walked out with him into the orchard, enquiring of him how the affairs of truth stood amongst them? (For many of them had been convinced by me before I was pri∣soner
in Cornwall.) While we were discoursing, a young
<PB N="20" REF="037441_0536_100D9187204A47F8"/>man came and told us the trained bands were raising, and he heard they would break up the meeting. It was not yet meeting-time by about three hours, and there being other friends walking in the orchard, the friend I was dis∣coursing with before desired me to walk into a corn-field adjoining to it, which we did. After awhile, the young man that spoke of the trained bands left us, and when he was gone a pretty way he stood and waved his hat. Where∣upon I spoke to the other young man that was with me to go see what he meant. He went, but came not to me again, for the soldiers were come into the orchard. As I kept walking I could see the soldiers, and some of them, as I heard afterwards, did see me, but had no mind to meddle. So the soldiers coming so long before meeting-time, did not tarry; but took what friends they found at the house, and some they met in the lane, and had them away. After they were gone, it drew towards the eleventh hour, friends began to come in apace, and a large and glorious meeting we had; for the everlasting seed of God was set over all, and the peo∣ple were settled in the new covenant of life, upon the foun∣dation Christ Jesus. Towards the latter end of the meeting there came a man in gay apparel, and looked in while I was declaring, and went away again presently. This man came with an evil intent; for he went forthwith to Ringwood, and told the magistrates, <Q>That they had taken two or three men at Pulner, and had left George Fox there preaching to two or three hundred.</Q> Upon this the magistrates sent the officers and soldiers again; but the meeting being near ended when the man looked in, and he having about a mile and a half to go with his information to fetch the soldiers, and they as far to come after they had received their orders, before they came our meeting was over; ending about the third hour peaceably and orderly. After the meeting, I spoke to the friends of the house where this was held (the woman of the house then lying dead in the house) and then some friends led me to another friend's at a little distance; where after we had refreshed ourselves, I took horse, having about twenty miles to ride that afternoon to one— Frye's. in Wiltshire, where a meeting was appointed to be held the next day.</P>
<P>After we were gone, the officers and soldiers came in a great heat, who finding they had missed their prey were much enraged; and the officers were offended with the sol∣diers, because they had not seized my horse in the stable
<PB N="21" REF="037441_0537_100D918969B667E0"/>the first time they came. But the Lord, by his good pro∣vidence, delivered me, and prevented their mischievous de∣sign. For the officers were envious men, and had an evil mind against friends; but the Lord brought his judgments upon them, so that it was taken notice of by their neigh∣bours. For <Q>as before they were wealthy men, after this their estates wasted away; and John Line, the constable, who was not only very forward in putting on the soldiers to take friends, but also carried those that were taken to prison, and took a false oath against them at the assize, upon which they were fined and continued prisoners, was a sad spectacle to behold. For his flesh rotting away while he lived, he died in a very miserable condition, wishing he had never meddled with the Quakers, and confessing he never prospered since he had an hand in persecuting them; and that he thought the hand of the Lord was against him for it.</Q></P>
<P>At—Frye's in Wiltshire we had a very blessed meet∣ing, and quiet, though the officers purposed to have broken it up, and were on their way in order thereunto. But be∣fore they were got to the meeting, word was brought them, <Q>There was a house newly broken up by thieves, and they were required to go back again with speed to search after and pursue them;</Q> by which means our meeting escaped disturbance, and we were preserved out of their hands.</P>
<P>We passed through Wiltshire into Dorsetshire, having large and good meetings. The Lord's everlasting power was with us, and carried us over all; in which we sounded forth his saving truth and word of life, which many gladly received. Thus we visited friends till we came to Topsham, in Devonshire, travelling some weeks eight or nine score miles a week, and had meetings every day. At Topsham we met with Margaret Fell and two of her daughters, Sa∣rah and Mary, and with Leonard Fell and Thomas Salt∣house. From thence we passed to Totness, where we visited some friends, and then to Kingsbridge, and to Henry Pol∣lexfen's, who had been an ancient justice of peace. There we had a large meeting. This old justice accompanied us to Plymouth, and into Cornwall, to justice Porter's, and from thence to Thomas Mount's, where we had a large meeting. After which we went to Humphry Lower's, where also we had a large meeting; and from thence to Loveday Hambley's, where we had a general meeting for the whole country: and all was quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037441_0538_100D918AF9B06308"/>
A little before this, Joseph Hellen, and G. Bewley had been at Loo to visit Blanch Pope, a Ranting woman, un∣der pretence to convince and convert her: but before they left her, she had so darkened them with her principles, that they seemed to be like her disciples, especially Joseph Hel∣len. She asked them, <Q>Who made the devil? Did not God?</Q> This idle question so puzzled them, they could not answer her. They afterwards asked me the question. I told them, No; for all that God made was good and was blest, so was not the devil. He was called a serpent before he was called a devil and an adversary and then he had the title of devil given him. Afterwards he was called a dragon, because he was a destroyer. The devil abode not in the truth: by departing from the truth he became a de∣vil. So the Jews, when they went out of the truth, were said to be of the devil, and were called serpents. There is no promise of God to the devil, that ever he shall return into truth again; but to man and woman, who have been deceived by him, the promise of God is, that <Q>The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head;</Q> shall break his power and strength to pieces. When these things were opened more at large to the satisfaction of friends, those two, who had let up the spirit of that ranting woman, were judged by the truth; and one of them, viz. Joseph Hellen, ran quite out, and was denied by friends; but Georgo Bewly was recovered, and afterwards became serviceable.</P>
<P>We passed from Loveday Hambley's to Francis Hodges's, near Falmouth and Penryn, where we had a large meeting. From thence we went to Helstone that night, where friends came to visit us, and next day passed to Thomas Teage's, where we had a large meeting, at which many were con∣vinced. I was led to open <Q>the state of the church in the primitive times, the state of the church in the wilderness, the state of the false church that was got up since; and to shew, that now the everlasting gospel was preached over the head of the whore, beast, false prophets, and anti∣christs, which had rose up since the apostles days; and now the everlasting gospel was received and receiving, which brought life and immortality to light, that they might see over the devil who had darkened them.</Q> The people received the gospel and the word of life gladly, and a glorious blessed meeting we had for the exalting the Lord's everlasting truth and his name. After it was done I walked out, and coming in again, I heard a noise in the court.
<PB N="23" REF="037441_0539_100D918D4B92D460"/>Approaching nearer, I found the man of the house speaking to the tinners and others, telling them, It was the <Q>ever∣lasting truth that had been declared there that day;</Q> and the people generally confessed to it.</P>
<P>From thence we passed to the Land's-end to John Ellis's, where we had a precious meeting. Here was a fisherman, Nicholas Jose, that was convinced. He spoke in meetings, and declared the truth amongst the people; and the Lord's power was over all. I was glad the Lord raised up his standard in those dark parts of the nation, where since there is a fine meeting of honest-hearted friends; many are come to sit under Christ's teaching, and a great people the Lord will have in that country.</P>
<P>From thence we returned to Redruth, and the next day to Truro, where we had a meeting. Next morning, some of the chief of the town desired to speak with me, amongst whom was colonel Rouse. I went, and had a great deal of discourse with them concerning the things of God. In their reasoning they said, <Q>The gospel was the four books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;</Q> and they called it natural. I told them, the gospel was the power of God, which was preached before Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John were written; and it was preached to every creature (of which a great part might never see nor hear of those four books) so that every creature was to obey the power of God; for Christ, the Spiritual Man, would judge the world ac∣cording to the gospel, that is, according to his invisible power. When they heard this, they could not gainsay; for the truth came over them. I directed them to their teacher, the grace of God, and shewed them the sufficiency of it, which would teach them how to live, and what to deny; and being obeyed would bring them salvation. So to that grace I recommended them, and left them.</P>
<P>Then we returned through the country, visiting friends, and had meetings at Humphrey Lower's and Thomas Mount's. Afterwards at, George Hawkins's at Stoke we had a large meeting, to which friends came from Lanceston and several other places. A living, precious meeting it was, in which the Lord's presence and power was richly manifested amongst us, and I left friends there under the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching.</P>
<P><Q>In Cornwall I was informed there was one colonel Ro∣binson, a very wicked man, who after the king came in was made a justice of peace, and became a cruel perse∣cutor
<PB N="24" REF="037441_0540_100D918FA1B13A98"/>of friends; of whom he sent many to prison. Hear∣ing they had some little liberty, through the favour of the gaoler, to go home sometimes to visit their wives and children, he made great complaint thereof to the judge at the assize against the gaoler: whereupon the gaoler was fined an hundred marks and friends were kept very strict∣ly up for awhile. After he was come home from the as∣size, he sent to a neighbouring justice to desire him to go a fanatick-hunting with him. He sent his man about with his horses, and walked himself on foot from his dwel∣ling-house to a tenement where his cows and dairy were kept, and where his servants were then milking. When he came there, he asked for his bull. The servant-maids said, They had shut him into the field because he was un∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, and hindered their milking. Then went he into the field to the bull; and having formerly accustomed himself to play with him he began to sence at him with his staff. But the bull snuffed at him, and passed a little back; then turning upon him again, ran fiercely at him, and struck his horn into his thigh, and heaving him upon his horn, threw him over his back, and tore up his thigh to his belly. When he came to the ground again he gored him with his horns run them into the ground in his rage and violence, and roared, and licked up his master's blood. The maid∣servant, hearing her master cry out, ran into the field, and took the bull by the horns to pull him off from her master. The bull, without hurting her, put her gently by with his horns, but still fell to goring of him, and licking up his blood. Then she ran, and got some men that were at work not far off, to come and rescue her master; but they could not at all beat off the bull, till they brought mastiff∣dogs to set on him; and then he fled in great rage and fu∣ry. Upon notice of it his sister came, and said to him, <Q>Alack! brother, what a heavy judgment is this that is befallen you!</Q> He answered, <Q>Ah! sister, it is an hea∣vy judgment indeed.</Q> Pray let the bull be killed, and the flesh given to the poor, said he. They carried him home; but he died soon after. The bull was grown so fierce, they were forced to shoot him with guns; for no man durst come near to kill him. Thus does the Lord sometimes make examples of his just judgment upon the persecutors of his people, that others may fear, and learn to beware.</Q></P>
<P>After I had cleared myself of Cornwall, and Thomas
<PB N="25" REF="037441_0541_100D9191B6D66FD8"/>Lower had brought us over Horse-bridge into Devonshire again, we took our leave of him. Thomas Briggs, Robert Widders, and I came to Tiverton. It being their fair∣time, and many friends there, we had a meeting amongst them; and the magistrates gathered in the street, but the Lord's power stopped them. I saw them over against the door; but they had not power to come in to meddle with us, though they had will enough to have done it.</P>
<P>After the meeting we passed to Collumpton and Wel∣lington; for we had appointed a meeting five miles off, where we had a large one at a butcher's house, and a bles∣sed meeting it was. The people were directed to their Teacher, the Grace of God, which would bring them salvation, and many were settled under its teaching. The Lord's presence was amongst us, and we were refreshed in him, in whom we laboured and travailed; and the meeting was quiet. There had been very great persecution in that country, and in that town a little before, insomuch that some friends questioned the peaceableness of our meeting; but the Lord's power chained all, and his glory shined over all. Friends told us, how they had broken up their meet∣ings by warrants from the justices, and how by their war∣rants they were required to carry friends before the justi∣ces. The friends bid them, Carry them then. The officers told them, they must Go; but they said, Nay, that was not according to their warrants, which required them to carry them. Then they were forced to hire carts, waggons, and horses, and to lift them into their waggons and carts to carry them before a justice. When they came to a justice's house, sometimes he happened to be from home, or if he was a moderate man he would get out of the way, and then they were obliged to carry them before another; so that they were many days carting and carrying friends up and down from place to place. And when afterwards the officers came to lay their charges for this upon the town, the town's people would not pay it, but made them bear it themselves, which broke the neck of their persecution there for that time. The like was done in several other places, till the officers had shamed and tired themselves, and then were glad to give over.</P>
<P>At one place they warned friends to come to the steeple-house. Friends met to consider of it, and sinding freedom to go, they met together there. They sate down to wait upon the Lord in his power and Spirir and minded the
<PB N="26" REF="037441_0542_100D9193A48E2780"/>Lord Jesus Christ, their Teacher and Saviour; but did not mind the priest. When the officers saw that, they came to them to put them out of the steeple-house again; but the friends told them, it was not time for them to break up their meeting yet. Awhile after, when the priest had done, they came to the friends again, and would have had them go home to dinner; but the friends told them, they did not choose to go to dinner, they were feeding upon the bread of life. So there they sate, waiting upon the Lord, and enjoying his power and presence, till they found freedom in themselves to depart. Thus the priest's people were of∣fended, first because they could not get them to the steeple-house, and when there, they were offended, because they could not get them out again.</P>
<P>From the meeting near Collumpton we went to Taun∣ton, where we had a large meeting. The next day we came to a general meeting in Somersetshire, which was very large; and the Lord's everlasting word of life and truth was largely declared. The people were refreshed thereby, and settled upon Christ, their Rock and Foundation, and brought to sit under his teaching; and the meeting was peaceable. About the second hour of the night came a company of men, knocked at the door, and bid open it, or they would break it open; for they wanted a man that they came to search the house for. I heard the noise, and got up, and saw a man at the door with his sword by his side. When they had let him in, he came into the chamber where I was, and looked on me, and said, <Q>You are not the man I look∣ed for;</Q> and went his way.</P>
<P>We came from thence to Street, and to William Beaton's at Puddimore, where we had a very large general meeting; wherein the Lord's everlasting truth was declared, the peo∣ple refreshed, and all quiet. From thence we went to John Dandy's, where we had another large and very precious meet∣ing; and then passed to Bristol, where we had good service for the Lord, and all quiet. Here we met with Margaret Fell and her daughters again. After some time we went to Slattenford in Wiltshire, where was a very large meeting in a great barn. Good service we had there; for the truth, as it is in Jesus, was published amongst them, and many were gathered by it into the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>After this I passed into Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, having large meetings in each. In Hereford I had a meet∣ing in the inn; after which, and I was gone, the magis∣trates
<PB N="27" REF="037441_0543_100D919550D82DF8"/>hearing of it, came to search the inn for me, and were vexed they had missed me. But the Lord so ordered it, that I escaped their hands, and friends were established up∣on Christ, their Foundation, the Rock of Ages.</P>
<P>Then I went into Radnorshire, in Wales, where I had several precious meetings. The Lord's name and standard was set up, many were gathered to it, and settled under the teaching of Christ Jesus, their Saviour, who bought them.</P>
<P>After I was clear of Wales, I came to a market-town be∣twixt England and Wales, where was a great fair that day; and several friends being at the fair, we went to an inn, where they came to us. After a fine opportunity with friends we parted and went our way. The officers of the town took notice it seems, of our being there, and of friends gathering to us. They began also to get together to con∣sult how to ensnare us, though it was the fair-time; but be∣fore they could do any thing we were gone, and so escaped them.</P>
<P>From thence we came into Shropshire, where we had a large and precious meeting. After many meetings in those parts, we came into Warwickshire, visited friends there, and so into Derbyshire and Staffordshire, visiting meetings as we went. At White-haugh we had a large blessed meet∣ing, and quiet; after which we took horse, and rode about twenty miles that night to captain Lingard's. We heard afterwards, that when we were gone, the officers came to have seized us, and were much disturbed they missed us; but the Lord disappointed them, and friends were joyful in the Lord that we escaped them.</P>
<P>At captain Lingard's we had a blessed meeting, the Lord's presence being wonderfully amongst us. After which we passed thro' the Peak-country in Derbyshire, and went to Synderhill-green, where we had a large meeting. Here John Whitehead and several friends came to me. Then I passed through the country, visiting friends, till I came to the farther end of Holderness, and by Scarborough, Whit∣by, and Malton, to York, having many meetings in the way, and the Lord's everlasting power was over all.</P>
<P>We went from york to Boroughbridge, where I had a glorious meeting. Thence we passed into the Bishoprick to one Richmond's, where was a general meeting; and the Lord's power was over all, though people were exceed∣ing rude about this time. After the meeting we went to Henry Draper's, where we staid all night. Next morning
<PB N="28" REF="037441_0544_100D919851C1C6C0"/>a friend came as I was passing away, and told me, <Q>If the priests and justices could light on me, they would destroy me.</Q></P>
<P>Being clear of the Bishoprick, I went over Stainmore into Yorkshire, and to Sedberg; where having visited friends, I went into Westmoreland, visiting friends there also. From thence I passed into Lancashire, and came to Swarthmore, where I staid but a little while before I went over the Sands to Arnside; where I had a general meeting. After it was ended some men came to have broken it up, but under∣standing before they got thither the meeting was over, they turned back. I went to Robert Widders's, and from thence to Underbarrow, where I had a glorious meeting; and the Lord's power was set over all. From thence I passed to Grayrigg, visited friends, and then to Ann Audland's, where they would have had me to have stay'd their meeting the next day; but I felt a stop in my Spirit. It was upon me to go to John Blaykling's, in Sedberg, to be at the meeting there; which is large, and a precious people there is. We had a very good meeting the next day; but the constables went to Ann Audland's meeting to look for me. Thus by the good hand and disposing providence of the Lord I escaped their snare.</P>
<P>I went from John Blaykling's with Leonard Fell to Strickland-head, where on, first-day we had a very precious meeting on the common. That night we staid amongst our friends there, and the next day passed into Northumberland. After the justices heard of this meeting, they made search for me; but by the good hand of the Lord I escaped them, though there were some very wicked justices. We went to Hugh Hutchinson's, in Northumberland, a friend in the ministry, from whence we visted friends thereabouts; and then to Derwent-water, where we had a very glorious meet∣ing. There came an ancient woman, and told me, her husband remembered his love to me; she said I might call him to mind by this token, that I used to call him, <Q>The tall white old man.</Q> She said, he was six score and two years old, and that he would have come to the meeting, but that his horses were all employed upon some urgent occa∣sion. I heard he lived some years after.</P>
<P>When I had visited friends in those parts, and they were settled upon Christ, their Foundation, I passed through Northumberland, and came to old Thomas Bewley's, in Cumberland. Friends came about me and asked, <Q>Would
<PB N="29" REF="037441_0545_100D919A4923EF70"/>I come there to go into prison?</Q> For there was great per∣secution in that country at that time; yet I had a general meeting at Thomas Bewley's, which was large and pre∣cious; and the Lord's power was over all.</P>
<P>One Musgrave was at that time deputy-governor of Car∣lisle, and I passing along that country, came to a man's house that had been convinced, whose name was Fletcher; and he told me, <Q>If Musgrave knew I was there, he would be sure to send me to prison, he was such a severe man.</Q> But I staid not, only called on the way to see this man, then went to William Pearson's, near Wigton, where this meeting was, which was very large and precious. Some friends were then prisoners at Carlisle, whom I visited by a letter, which Leonard Fell carried. From William Pear∣son's I visited friends till I came to Pardsey-crag; where we had a general meeting, which was large, quiet, and peacea∣ble, and the glorious, powerful presence of the everlasting God was with us.</P>
<P>So eager were the magistrates about this time to stir up persecution in those parts, that some offered five shillings, some a noble a day, to any that could apprehend the speakers amongst Quakers; but it being now the time of the quarter-sessions in that county, the men who were so hired were gone to the sessions to get their w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ges, so all our meetings were at that time quiet.</P>
<P>From Pardsey-crag we went into Westomoreland, calling in the way upon Hugh Tickell, near Keswick, and upon Thomas Laythes, where friends came to visit us; and we had a fine opportunity to be refreshed together. We went that night to Francis Benson's, in Westmoreland, near jus∣tice Fleming's. This justice was at that time in a great rage against friends, and me in particular; insomuch that in the open sessions at Kendal, just before, he had bid <Q>Five pounds to any man that should take me,</Q> as Francis Ben∣son told me. And it seems, as I went to this friend's house, I met one man coming from the sessions that had this five pounds offered him to take me, and he knew me; for as I passed by him, he said to his companion, <Q>That is George Fox:</Q> yet he had not power to touch me; for the Lord preserved me over them all. The justices being so eager to have me, and I being so often nigh them and you they missing me, it tormented them the more.</P>
<P>I went from thence to James Taylor's at Cartmel, in Lan∣cashire,
<PB N="30" REF="037441_0546_100D919BD96B56E8"/>where I staid first-day, and had a precious meeting. After which I came over the Sands to Swarthmore.</P>
<P>There they told me coloned Kirby had sent his lieutenant, who had searched trunks and chests for me. That night as I was in bed, I was moved of the Lord to go next day to Kirby-hall, which was colonel Kirby's house about five miles off, to speak with him. When I came thither, I found the Flemings, and several others of the gentry (so called) of the country, who were come to take their leave of colonel Kirby, he being then to go up to London to the parliament. I was had into the parlour amongst them; but colonel Kirby was not then within, being gone out a little way. They said little to me, nor I much to them. But after a little while colonel Kirby came in, and I told him, <Q>I came to visit him, understanding he was desirous to see me, to know what he had to say to me, and whe∣ther he had any thing against me?</Q> He said before all the company, <Q>As he was a gentleman, he had nothing against me. But,</Q> said he, <Q>mistress Fell must not keep great meetings at her house, for they met contrary to the act.</Q> I told him, <Q>That act did not take hold on us, but on such as <Q>met to plot and contrive, and to raise insurrections against the king;</Q> whereas we we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no such people: for he knew they that met at Margaret Fell's were his neigh∣bours, and a peaceable people.</Q> After many words had passed, he shook me by the hand, and said again, <Q>He had nothing against me;</Q> and others of them said, <Q>I was a deserving man.</Q> So we parted, and I returned to Swarth∣more.</P>
<P>Shortly after, when colonel Kirby was gone to London, there was a private meeting of the justices and deputy-lieu∣tenants at Houlker-hall, where justice Preston lived; where they granted a warrant to apprehend me. I heard over night both of their meeting and of the warrant, and could have gone out of their reach if I would; for I had not ap∣pointed any meeting at that time, and I had cleared myself of the north, and the Lord's power was over all. But I considered, there being a noise of a plot in the north, if I should go away they might fall upon friends; but if I gave myself up to be taken, it might prevent them, and friends should escape the better; so I gave myself up to be taken, and prepared against they came. Next day an officer came with his sword and pistols to take me. I told him, <Q>I knew his errand before, and had given myself to be taken;
<PB N="31" REF="037441_0547_100D919DC8F3BF80"/>for if I would have escaped their imprisonment, I could have been forty miles off before he came; but I was an innocent man, and so mattered not what they could do to me.</Q> He asked me, <Q>How I heard of it, seeing the order was made privately in a parlour?</Q> I said, it was no matter for that, it was sufficient that I heard it. I asked him to let me see his order; whereupon he laid his hand on his sword, and said, <Q>I must go with him before the lieutenants, to answer such questions as they should propound to me.</Q> I told him, it was but civil and reasonable for him to let me see his order; but he would not. Then said I, I am ready. So I went along with him, and Margaret Fell ac∣companied us to Houlker-hall. When we came thither, there was one Rawlinson, a justice, and one called Sir George Middleton, and many more that I did not know, besides old justice Preston who lived there. They brought Thomas Atkinson, a friend, of Cartmel, as a witness against me, for some words which he had told to one Knipe, who had informed them; which words were, <Q>That I had writ∣ten against the plotters, and had knocked them down.</Q> These words they could not make much of; for I told them I had heard of a plot and had written against it. Old Preston asked me, 'Whether I had an hand in that script?' I asked him what he meant? He said, in the Battledore? I answered, Yes. Then he asked me, <Q>Whether I did un∣derstand languages?</Q> I said, Sufficient for myself; and <Q>that I knew no law that was transgressed by it. I told them also, That to understand those outward languages, was no matter of salvation; for the many tongues began but at the confusion of Babel: and if I did understand any thing of them, I judged and knocked them down again for any matter of salvation that was in them.</Q> Thereupon he turned away, and said, <Q>George Fox knocks down all the languages. Come,</Q> said he, <Q>we will exa∣mine you of higher matters.</Q></P>
<P>Then said George Middleton, <Q>You deny God, and the church, and the faith.</Q> I replied, <Q>Nay: I own God, and the true church, and the true faith. But what church dost thou own, said I?</Q> (for I understood he was a Papist.) Then he turned again, and said, <Q>You are a rebel and a traitor.</Q> I asked him, Whom he spoke to? or whom did he call a rebel? He was so full of envy, that for 02 awhile he could not speak; but at last he said, <Q>He spoke it to me.</Q> With that I struck my hand on the table, and
<PB N="32" REF="037441_0548_100D91A04CD2E1F8"/>told him, I had suffered more than twenty such as he, or than any that were there; <Q>for I had been cast into Derby prison for six months together, and had suffered much be∣cause I would not take up arms against the king before Worcester fight. I had been sent up prisoner out of my own country by colonel Hacker to O. Cromwel, as a plot∣ter to bring in K. Charles, in the year 1654; and I had nothing but love and good-will to the king, and desired the eternal good and welfare of him and all his subjects. "Did you ever hear the like?". said Middleton. Nay, said I, ye may hear it again, if ye will. For ye talk of the king, a company of you; but where were ye in Oliver's days? and what did ye do then for him? I have more love to the king for his eternal good and welfare than any of you have.</Q></P>
<P>Then they asked me, <Q>Whether I had heard of the plot? I said, Yes, I had heard of it.</Q> They asked me, <Q>How I had heard of it? and whom I knew in it?</Q> I told them, <Q>I had heard of it through the high-sheriff of Yorkshire, who told Dr. Hodgson there was a plot in the north;" that was the way I heard of it; but I never heard of any such thing in the south, nor till I came into the north. And as for knowing any in the plot, I was as a child in that, for I knew none of them.</Q> Then they said, <Q>Why would you write against it, if you had not known some that were in it?</Q> I said, <Q>My reason was, because you are so for∣ward to mash the innocent and guilty together; therefore I wrote against it to clear the truth from such things, and to stop all forward foolish spirits from running into such things.</Q> I sent copies of it into Westmoreland, Cumber∣land, <Q>Bishoprick, Yorkshire, and to you here. I sent an∣other copy of it to the king and his council, and it is like it may be in print by this time.</Q> One of them said, <Q>O! this man hath great power!</Q> I said, Yes, I had power to write against plotters. Then said one of them, <Q>You are against the laws of the land.</Q> I answered <Q>Nay; for I and my friends direct all people to the Spirit of God in them, to mortify the deeds of the flesh. This brings them into well-doing, and from that which the magistrates sword is against, which eases the magistrates, who are for the pu∣nishment of evil-doers. People being turned to the Spirit of God, which brings them to mortify the deeds of the flesh, from under the occasion of the magistrates sword. This must needs be one with magistracy, and one with
<PB N="33" REF="037441_0549_100D91A2375E7810"/>the law, which was added because of transgression, and is for the praise of them that do well. In this we establish the law, are an ease to the magistrates, and are not against but stand for all good government.</Q></P>
<P>Then George Middleton cried, <Q>Bring the book, and put the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to him.</Q> He being a Papist, I asked him, <Q>Whether he had taken the oath of supremacy, who was a swearer? As for us, we could not swear at all, because Christ and his apostle had forbidden it.</Q> Some of them would not have had the oath put to me, but have set me at liberty. The rest would not agree to it; for this was their last snare, and they had no other way to get me into prison, as all other things had been cleared to them. This was like the Papists sacrament of the altar, by which they ensnared the martyrs. So they tendered me the oath, which I could not take; whereupon they were about to make my mittimus to send me to Lancaster gaol; but considering of it, they only engaged me to appear at the sessions, and for that time dismissed me. I went back with Margaret Fell to Swarthmore, and soon after colonel West came to see me, who was-at that time a justice of peace. He told us, <Q>He acquainted some of the rest of the justices, that he would come and see Margaret Fell and me; but it may be,</Q> said he, 'some of you will take offence at it.' I asked him, What he thought they would do with me at the sessions? He said, <Q>They would tender the oath to me again.</Q></P>
<P>Whilst I was at Swarthmore, William Kirby came into Swarthmore meeting, and brought the constables with him. I was sitting with friends in the meeting, and he said to me, 'How now, Mr. Fox! you have a fine company here.' 'Yes,' said I, 'we meet to wait upon the Lord.' So he began to take the names of friends, and those that did not readily tell him their names, he committed to the constables hands, and sent some to prison. The constables were un∣willing to take them without a warrant, whereupon he threat∣ened to set them by the heels; but the constable told him, <Q>He could keep them in his presence, but after he was gone he could not keep them without a warrant.</Q></P>
<P>The sessions coming on, I went to Lancaster, and ap∣peared according to my engagement. There was upon the bench justice Fleming, who had bid five pounds in West moreland to any man that would apprehend me; for he was a justice both in Westmoreland and Lancashire. There
<PB N="34" REF="037441_0550_100D91A3CC6ACD70"/>were also justice Spencer, colonel West, and old justice Rawlinson, the lawyer, who gave the charge, and was very sharp against truth and friends; but the Lord's power stop∣ped them. The session was large, the concourse of people great, and way being made for me, I came up to the bar, and stood with my hat on, they looking earnestly upon me and I upon them for a pretty space. Proclamation be∣ing made <Q>for all to keep silence upon pain of imprison∣ment;</Q> and all being quiet, I said twice, <Q>Peace be among you.</Q> The chairman asked, If I knew where I was? I said, <Q>Yes, I do; but it may be, said I, my hat offends you. That's a low thing, that's not the honour that I give to magistrates, for the true honour is from above; which, said I, I have received, and I hope it is not the hat which ye look upon to be the honour.</Q> The chairman said, 'They looked for the hat too,' and asked, <Q>Wherein I shewed my respect to magistrates, if I did not put off my hat?</Q> I replied, 'In coming when they called me.' Then they bid one, 'Take off my hat.' After which it was some time before they spoke to me, and I felt the pow∣er of the Lord to arise. After some pause, old justice Rawlinson (the chairman) asked me, <Q>If I knew of the plot?</Q> I told him, <Q>I heard of it in Yorkshire by a friend, who had it from the high-sheriff.</Q> They asked me, 'Whether I had declared it to the magistrates?' I said, <Q>I had sent papers abroad against plots and plotters, and also to you, as soon as I came into the country, to take all jealousies out of your minds concerning me and my friends; for it is our principle to declare against such things.</Q> They asked me, <Q>If I knew not of an act against meetings?</Q> I said, <Q>I knew there was an act that took hold of such as met to the terrifying of the king's subjects, were enemies to the king, and held dangerous principles; but I hoped they did not look upon us to be such men, for our meetings were not to terrify the king's subjects, neither are we enemies to him or any man.</Q> Then they tendered me the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. I told them, <Q>I could not take any oath at all, because Christ and his apostle had forbid it; and they had sufficient ex∣perience of swearers, first one way, then another; but I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er taken any oath in my life.</Q> Rawlinson asked me, 'Whether I held it was unlawful to swear?' This question he put on purpose to ensnare me; for by an act that was made; such were liable to banishment or a great
<PB N="35" REF="037441_0551_100D91A55E33BC38"/>fine, that should say, it was 'unlawful to swear.' But I, seeing the snare, avoided it, and told him, <Q>That in the time of the law amongst the Jews, before Christ came, the law commanded them to swear; but Christ, who doth fulfil the law in his gospel-time, commands, <Q>not to swear at all;</Q> and the apostle James forbids swearing, even to them that were Jews, and who had the law of God.</Q> After much discourse they called for the gaoler, and committed me to prison. I had the paper about me which I wrote as a testimony against plots, which I desired they would read, or suffer to be read in open court; but they would not. So being committed for refusing to swear, <Q>I bid them and all the people take notice, that I suffered for the doctrine of Christ, and for my obedience to his command.</Q> After∣wards I understood the justices did say, that they had pri∣vate instructions from colonel Kirby to prosecute me, not∣withstanding his fair carriage and seeming kindness to me before, when he declared before many of them. <Q>That he had nothing against me.</Q> Several other friends were com∣mitted to prison, some for meeting to worship God, and some for not swearing; so that the prison was very full. Many of them being poor men, without any thing to main∣tain their families by but their labour, which now they were taken from, several of their wives went to the justices who committed their husbands, and told them, <Q>If they kept their husbands in gaol for nothing but the truth of Christ and for good conscience-sake, they would bring their chil∣dren to them to be maintained.</Q> A mighty power of the Lord rose in friends, and gave them great boldness, so that they spoke much to the justices. Friends also that were prisoners wrote to the justices, <Q>laying the weight of their sufferings upon them, and shewing them both their injustice and want of compassion towards their poor neighbours, whom they knew to be honest, conscientious, peaceable people, that in tenderness of conscience could not take any oath; yet they sent them to prison for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. Though several of those imprisoned on that account were known to be men who had served the king in his wars, had hazarded their lives in the field in his cause, had suffered great hardships, with the loss of much blood for him, and always stood faithful to him from first to last, yet never received pay for their service; and to be thus requited for all their faithful services and sufferings by those that pretended to be the king's friends,
<PB N="36" REF="037441_0552_100D91A7C3EC8058"/>was hard, unkind, and ungrateful dealing.</Q> At length the justices, being continually attended with complaints of grievances, released some of the friends, but kept divers still in prison.</P>
<P>There were four friends prisoners for tithes, sent to prison at the suit of the countess of Derby, who had lain near two years and an half. One of these was Oliver Atherton, who being of a weakly constitution was through long and hard imprisonment in a cold, raw, unwholesome place, brought so low and weak in his body, that there appeared no hopes of his life unless he might be removed. Where∣fore a letter was wrote on his behalf to the countess, and sent by his son Godfrey Atherton, wherein was laid before her <Q>the reasons why he and the rest could not pay tithes; because if they did, they should deny Christ come in the flesh, who by his coming had put an end to the tithes, and to the priesthood to which they had been given, and to the commandment by which they had been paid under the law. His weak condition of body was also laid before her, and the apparent likelihood of his death, if she con∣tinued to hold him there, that she might be moved to pity and compassion, and also warned not to draw the guilt of innocent blood upon her.</Q> When his son went to her with his father's letter, a servant of hers abused him, pluck∣ed off his cap and threw it away, and put him out of the gate. Nevertheless the letter was delivered into her own hand, but she shut out all pity and tenderness, and con∣tinued him in prison till death. When his son returned to his father in prison, and told him as he lay on his dying∣bed, that the countess denied his liberty, he only said, <Q>She hath been the cause of shedding much blood, but this will be the heaviest blood that ever she spilt,</Q> and soon after he died. Friends having his body delivered to them to bury, as they carried it from the prison to Ormskirk, the parish wherein he had lived, they stuck up papers upon the crosses at Garstang, Preston, and other towns through which they passed, with this inscription:</P>
<P><Q>This is Oliver Atherton, of Ormskirk parish, perse∣cuted to death by the countess of Derby for good con∣science-sake towards God and Christ, because he could not give her tithes, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Setting forth the reasons of his refusing to pay tithes, the
<PB N="37" REF="037441_0553_100D91A9B056FC18"/>length of his imprisonment, the hardships he underwent, her hard-heartedness towards him, and the manner of his death. After his death, Richard Cubban, another of her prisoners for tithes, wrote a large letter to her, on behalf of himself and his fellow-prisoners at her suit, laying their innocency before her; <Q>and that it was not out of wilful∣ness, stubbornness, or covetousness, that they refused to pay their tithes, but purely in good conscience towards God and Christ; letting her know, if she should be suf∣fered to keep them there till they every one died, as she had done their fellow-sufferer, Oliver Atherton, they could not yield to pay her. And therefore desired her to con∣sider their case in a Christian spirit, and not bring their blood upon herself also.</Q> Yet she would not shew any pity or compassion to them, who had now suffered hard imprisonment about two years and an half under her. In∣stead thereof she sent to Garstang, and threatened to com∣plain to the king and council, and bring them into trouble, for suffering the paper concerning Oliver Atherton's death to be stuck upon their cross. The rage she expressed made the people take the more notice of it, and some of them said, 'The Quakers had given her a bone to pick.' But she, that regarded not the life of an innocent sufferer for Christ, lived not long after herself; for that day three weeks that Oliver Atherton's body was carried through Ormskirk to be buried, she died; and her body was carried that day seven weeks through the same town to her burying-place. Thus the Lord pursued the hard-hearted persecutor. I was kept till the assize, and judge Turner and judge Twis∣den coming that circuit, I was brought before judge Twis∣den, the 14th of the month called March, the latter end of the year 1663. When I was set to the bar, I said, <Q>Peace be amongst you all.</Q> The judge looked upon me, and said, <Q>What! do you come into the court with your hat on! Upon which words, the gaoler taking it off, I said, The hat is not the honour that comes from God.</Q> Then said the judge to me, <Q>Will you take the oath of allegi∣ance, George Fox?</Q> I said, <Q>I never took any oath in my life, nor any covenant or engagement.</Q> 'Well,' said he, 'Will you swear or no?' I answered, <Q>I am a Chris∣tian, and Christ commands me "not to swear;" so does the apostle James; and whether I should obey God or man, do thou judge.</Q> I ask your again, said he, <Q>Whether you will swear or no?</Q> I answered again, <Q>I am neither
<PB N="38" REF="037441_0554_100D91AB9F225A28"/>Turk, Jew, nor Heathen, but a Christian, and should th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w forth christianity. I asked him, If he did not know that Christians in the primitive times, under the ten persecu∣tions, and some also of the martyrs in queen Mary's days, refused swearing, because Christ and the apostle had for∣bidden it? I told him also, they had experience enough, how many had first sworn for the king and then against him. But as for me I had never taken an oath in my life, My allegiance did not lie in swearing, but in truth and faithfulness; for I honour all men, much more the king. But Christ, who is the Great Prophet, the King of kings, the Saviour and Judge of the whole world, saith, I must "not swear." Now, whether must I obey Christ or thee? For it is tenderness of conscience, and in obedience to the command of Christ, that I do not swear: and we have the word of a king for tender consciences. Then I asked the judge, If he did own the king? "Yes," said he, <Q>I do own the king.</Q> Why then, said I, dost thou not observe his declaration from Breda, and his promises made since he came into England, <Q>That no man should be called in question for matters of religion, so long as they lived peaceably?</Q> If thou ownest the king, said I, why dost thou call me in question, and put me upon taking an oath, which is a matter of religion; seeing thou nor none else can charge me with unpeaceable living?</Q> Upon this he was moved, and looking angrily at me, said, <Q>Sir∣rah, will you swear?</Q> I told him, <Q>I was none of his Sirrahs, I was a Christian; and for him, an old man, and a judge, to sit there and give nick-names to prisoners, it did not become either his grey hairs or his office.</Q> 'Well,' said he, 'I am a Christian too.' <Q>Then do Christian works,</Q> said I. 'Sirrah!' said he, <Q>Thou thinkest to frighten me with thy words.</Q> Then catching himself, and looking aside, he said, <Q>Hark! I am using the word (Sirrah) again;</Q> so checked himself. I said, <Q>I spoke to thee in love; for that language did not become thee, a judge. Thou oughtest to instruct a prisoner in the law, if he were ignorant and out of the way.</Q> <Q>And I speak in love to thee too,</Q> said he. 'But,' said I, 'Love gives no nick∣names.' Then he roused himself up, and said, <Q>I will not be afraid of thee, George Fox. Thou speakest so loud, thy voice drowns mine and the court's; I must call for three or four criers to drown thy voice: thou hast good lungs.</Q> 'I am a prisoner here,' said I, <Q>for the Lord Je∣sus
<PB N="39" REF="037441_0555_100D91AD8E2BF9B8"/>Christ's sake; for his sake do I suffer, for him do I stand this day, and if my voice were five times louder I should lift it up, and sound it out for Christ's fake, for whose cause I stand this day before your judgment-seat, in obedience to him who commands "not to swear;" be∣fore whose judgment-seat you must all be brought, and must give an account.</Q> 'Well,' said the judge, <Q>George Fox, say, Whether thou wilt take the oath, Yea or Nay?</Q> I replied, <Q>I say as I said before, Whether ought I to obey God or man, judge thou? If I could take any oath at all, I should take this; for I do not deny some oaths only or on some occasions, but all oaths, according to Christ's doctrine, who hath commanded his, "Not to swear at all." Now if thou or any of you, or any of your ministers or priests here, will prove that ever Christ or his apostle, after they had forbid all swearing, commanded Christians to swear, then I will swear.</Q> I saw several priests there; but not one of them offered to speak. Then said the judge, <Q>I am a servant to the king, and the king sent me not to dis∣pute with you, but to put the laws in execution; there∣fore tender him the oath of allegiance.</Q> <Q>If thou love the king,</Q> said I, <Q>why dost thou break his word, and not keep his declarations and speeches, wherein he promised liberty to tender consciences? I am a man of a tender conscience, and in obedience to Christ's command I can∣not swear.</Q> 'Then you will not swear,' said the judge; 'Take him away, gaoler.' I said, <Q>It is for Christ's sake that I cannot swear, and for obedience to his command I suffer; and so the Lord forgive you all.</Q> So the gaoler took me away; but I felt the mighty power of the Lord was over them all.</P>
<P>The sixteenth of the same month I was brought before judge Twisden again, who was somewhat offended at my hat; but it being the last morning of the assize, before he was to go out of town, and not many people there, he made the less of it. He asked me, <Q>Whether I would tra∣verse, stand mute, or submit.</Q> But he spoke so fast, it was hard to know what he said. However I told him, <Q>I desired I might have liberty to traverse the indictment, and try it.</Q> Then said he, <Q>Take him away. I will have nothing to do with him, take him away.</Q> I said, <Q>Well, live in the fear of God, and do justice.</Q> 'Why,' said he, 'have not I done you justice?' I replied, <Q>That which thou hast done hath been against the command of Christ.</Q>
<PB N="40" REF="037441_0556_100D91AF2EC93FC8"/>So I was taken to the gaol again, and kept prisoner till the next assizes.</P>
<P>Some time before this assize, Margaret Fell was sent pri∣soner to Lancaster gaol by Fleming, Kirby, and Preston, justices; and at the assize the oath was tendered to her also, and she was again committed to prison to lie till the next assize.</P>
<P>Justice Fleming being one of the fiercest and most vio∣lent justices in persecuting friends, and sending his honest neighbours to prison for religion's ske; and many friends being at this time in Lancaster gaol committed by him, and 02 some having died in prison, we that were then prisoners had it upon us to write to him, as followeth.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>O justice Fleming!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MERCY, compassion, love, and kindness adorn and grace men and magistrates. Oh! dost thou not hear the cry of the widows, and the cry of the fatherless, who were made so through persecution! Were they not driven like sheep, from constable to constable, as though they had been the greatest transgressors or malefactors in the land? Which grieved and tendered the hearts of many so∣ber people, to see how their innocent neighbours and countrymen, who were of a peaceable carriage, and honest in their lives and conversations among men, were used and served! One more is dead, whom thou sentest to prison, having left five children fatherless and motherless. How canst thou do otherwise than take care of those fatherless infants, and also of the other's wife and family? Is it not thy place? Consider Job (c. xxix.) He was a father to the poor, he delivered the poor that cried, and the father∣less that had none to help. He broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. But oh! measure thy life and his, and take heed of the day of God's eternal judgment, which will come, and the sen∣tence and decree from Christ, when every man must give an account and receive a reward according to his deeds. Then it will be said, <Q>Oh! where are the months that are past!</Q> Again, justice Fleming, consider, when John Stubbs was brought before thee, having a wife and four small children, and little to live on but what they honestly got by their own diligence; as soon as he appeared, thou cried out. "Put the oath to that man." And when he confessed he was but a poor man, thou hadst no regard,
<PB N="41" REF="037441_0557_100D91B1D5B5C128"/>but cast away pity, not hearing what he would say. And now he is kept in prison, because he could not swear, and break the command of Christ and the apostle, it is to be hoped thou wilt take care of his family, that his children do not starve; and see that they do not want bread. Can this be allegiance to the king, to do that which Christ and his apostle say is evil, and brings into condemnation? Would not you have cast Christ and the apostle into pri∣son, who commanded "not to swear," if they had been in your days? Consider also thy poor neighbour, Wil∣liam Wilson, who was known to all the parish and neigh∣bours to be an industrious man, careful to maintain his wife and children; yet had little but what he got with his hands in diligence and travels to supply himself. How should his wife maintain her children, when thou hast cast her husband into prison, and thereby made him incapable of working for them? Therefore it may be expected thou wilt have a care of his wife and children, and see they do not want; for how should they live, having no other way to be sustained but by the little that he got? Surely the noise of this is in the very markets, the death of thy two neighbours, the cry of the widows and fatherless is heard. All those fatherless and widows are made so for righteous∣ness sake. For might not John Stubbs and William Wil∣son have had their liberty still, if they would have sworn, though they had been such as go after mountebanks and stage-plays, or run a hunting? Oh! consider! for the Lord's mind is otherwise. He is tender, and the king hath declared his mind to be, that there should be no cru∣elty inflicted upon his peaceable subjects. Besides, several poor honest people were fined, who had need to have something given them; and it had been more honourable to have given them something, than to fine them and send them to prison, some of whom live upon the charity of others. What honour or grace can it be to thee to cast thy poor neighbours into prison, who are peaceable; see∣ing thou knowest these people cannot do that which thou requirest of them, if it were to save their lives or all that they have? Because in tenderness they cannot take any oath, thou makest that a snare to them. What thinkest thou do the people say concerning this? "We know," say they, <Q>the Quakers principle that keep to Yea and Nay; but we see others swear and forswear.</Q> Many of you have sworn first one way and then another. So we
<PB N="42" REF="037441_0558_100D91B3645FF360"/>leave it to the Spirit of God in thy conscience, justice Fleming, who wast so eager for the taking of George Fox, and so offended with them that had not taken him, and now hast fallen upon thy poor neighbours. But oh! where's thy pity for their poor, fatherless children, and motherless infants? Oh! take heed of Herod's hard-heart∣edness, and casting away all pity! Esau did so, not Jacob, Here is also Thomas Walters, of Bolton, cast into prison, and the oath imposed on him through thee, and for deny∣ing to swear at all, in obedience to Christ's command, he is continued in prison, who hath five small children and his wife near down-lying. Surely, thou shouldest take care for them also, and see that his wife and small children do not want, who are as fatherless and she as a widow through thee. Dost thou not hear in thy ears the cry of the fatherless, the cry of the widows, and the blood of the innocent speak, who through thee have been persecuted to prison, and are now dead? Oh! heavy sentence at the day of judgment! How wilt thou answer, when thou and thy works come to be judged, when thou shalt be brought before the judgment-seat of the Almighty, who in thy pros∣perity hast made widows and fatherless for righteousness∣sake, and for tenderness of conscience towards God? The Lord knows and sees it! O man! consider in thy life-time how thou hast stained thyself with the blood of the inno∣cent! When thou had'st power and might'st have done good amongst thy peaceable neighbours, thou would'st not: but usedst thy power not to a good intent, but con∣trary to the Lord's mind and to the king's. The king's savour, mercy, and clemency to sober people and tender consciences hath been manifested by declarations and pro∣clamations, which thou hast abused and slighted by perse∣cuting his peaceable subjects. At London and in other parts the Quakers meetings are peaceable; and if thou look but as far as Yorkshire, where the plot hath been, friends innocency hath cleared itself in the hearts of sober justices; and for you here to fall upon your peaceable neighbours and people, and to be rigorous and violent against them that are tender, godly, and righteous, it is no honour to you. How many drunkards, swearers, and fighters, and such as are subject to vice, have you caused to be brought before you to your courts? It were more honourable for you to look after such; for the law was not made for the righteous, but for sinners and transgressors. Therefore
<PB N="43" REF="037441_0559_100D91B55453C028"/>consider, and be humbled for these things; for the Lord may do to thee as thou hast done to others; and thou dost not know how soon there may be a cry in thy own family, as the cry is amongst thy neighbours, of the fatherless and widows that are made so through thee. But the Quakers can and do say, <Q>The Lord forgive thee, and lay not these things to thy charge, if it be his will.</Q></P>

<P>It was not long after this ere Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherless children.</P>
<P>When I was prisoner at Lancaster, there was prisoner al∣so one major Wiggan, a Baptist-preacher. He boasted much before-hand what he would say at the assize, if the oath should be put to him; and that he would refuse to swear. But when the assize came, and the oath was ten∣dered him, he desired time to consider of it; and that being granted him till the next assize, he got leave to go to Lon∣don before the assize came again, and staid at London till the plague broke forth, and there both he and his wife were cut off. He was a very wicked man, and the judgments of God came upon him; for he had published a very wicked book against friends, full of lies and blasphemies; the occa∣sion of which was this. Whilst he was in Lancaster castle, he challenged friends to a dispute. Whereupon I got leave of the ga <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to go up to them. And entering into discourse with him, he affirmed, <Q>That some men never had the Spi∣rit of God, and that the true light, which enlighteneth eve∣ry one that cometh into the world, is natural.</Q> For proof of his first assertion, he instanced Balaam, affirming, <Q>Ba∣laam had not the Spirit of God,, I affirmed and proved, That Balaam had the Spirit of God, and that wicked men have the Spirit of God, else how could they quency it, vex it, grieve it, and resist the Holy Ghost, like the stiff-necked
<PB N="44" REF="037441_0560_100D91B744E00048"/>Jews?</Q> To his second assertion, I answered, <Q>That the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, was the life in the world, and that was di∣vine and eternal, and not natural. And he might as well say, the word was natural as that the life in the word was natural. And wicked men were enlightened by this light, else how could they hate it? It is expressly said, they did hate it; and the reason given why, was, <Q>because their deeds were evil;</Q> and they would not come to it, because it reproved them; and that must needs be in them, which reproved them. Besides, that ligth could not be the scrip∣tures of the New-Testament; for it was testified of before any part of the New-Testament was written; so it must be by the Divine Light, which is the life in Christ, the Word, before the scriptures were. And the grace of God, which brought salvation, had appeared unto all men, and taught the saints; but they that turned from it into wan∣tonness, and walked despitefully against the Spirit of Grace, were the wicked. Again, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, which leads the disciples of Christ into all truth, the same should reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, of judgment, and of their unbelief. So the wicked world had it to reprove them, and the true disciples and learners of Christ, that believed in the light as Christ commands, had it to lead them. But the world that did not believe in the light, though they were lighted, but hated the light which they should have believed in, and loved the darkness rather than it, this world had a right∣eousness and a judgment, which the Holy Ghost reproved them for, as well as for their unbelief.</Q> Having proved, that the good and the bad were enlightened, that the Grace of God had appeared unto all, and that all had the Spirit of God, else they could not vex and grieve it, I told major Wiggan, The least babe there might see him; and presently stood up one Richard Cubham, and proved him an anti∣christ and a deceiver by scripture. Then the gaoler had me away to my prison again. Afterwards Wiggan wrote a book of this dispute, and put in abundance of abominable lies; which was soon answered in print, and himself was not long after cut off, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>This Wiggan was poor, and while he was prisoner at Lancaster he sent into the country, and got money gathered for relief of the poor people of God in prison; and many people gave freely, thinking it had been for us, when in∣deed
<PB N="45" REF="037441_0561_100D91B9EAF74480"/>it was for himself. But when we heard of it, we laid it upon him, and wrote into the country, that friends might let the people know the truth of the matter, that it was not our manner to have collections made for us, and that those collections were only for Wiggan and another, a drunken preacher of his society: who was so drunk, that once he lost his breeches.</P>
<P>After this it came upon me to write to the judges and other magistrates concerning their <Q>giving evil words and nick-names to such as were brought before them.</Q> Which was after this manner.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To all judges or other officers whatsoever in the whole world, who profess yourselves to be Christians.<LB/>
Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEREIN and by reading the scriptures, ye may see both your own words and behaviour, and the words and practice of both Jews and Heathens, and of the King of kings, the great Lawgiver and Judge of the whole World. First, concerning the words and carriage of the Jews, when some worthy of death were brought before the rulers amongst them. When Achan had taken the Ba∣bylonish garment, the two hundred shekels of silver, and the wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, and Joshua, who was then judge of Israel, had by the lot discovered him, he did not call him, Sirrah, nor you Rascal, Knave, Rogue, as some, called Christian magistrates, are too apt to do. But Joshua said unto Achan, "My son." Mark his clean language, savoury expression, and gracious words. "My son," said he, <Q>give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him, and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me.</Q> Then Achan confessed, that he had sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus he had done. Then Joshua, the judge, said, <Q>Why hast thou troubled Israel? The Lord shall trouble thee this day; and they stoned him and his with stones, and burned his goods with fire.</Q> But there was no unsavoury word given him that we read of, though he was worthy of death, Josh. vii.</P>
<P>So when the man, that gathered sticks upon the sab∣bath-day, was taken and brought before Moses, the judge of Israel, and put in ward till the mind of the Lord
<PB N="46" REF="037441_0562_100D91BB7A9CBED8"/>was known concerning him, we read not of any reviling language given him; but the Lord said to Moses, and Moses to the people, <Q>The man shall surely be put to death,</Q> Numb. xv. 35.</P>
<P>Likewise in the rebellion of Corah, Dathan and Abi∣ram, when Moses called them to trial, he did not sirrah them nor misname them; but said to Corah and the rest, "Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi," Numb. xvi. 8. And when he gave the sentence against them, he said, <Q>If these men die the common death of all men,</Q> &amp;c. He did not say, If these Rascals or Knaves, as many that profess themselves Christians now do.</P>
<P>When Elihu spoke to Job, who was a judge, and to his friends, and said, <Q>Let me not, I pray you, accept of any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man, for I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away,</Q> Job xxxii. Job did not say, "Sirrah, hold thy tongue;" nor gave him any unsavoury expression. The words of David, Solo∣mon, and other kings and officers, see in the books of the Kings and Chronicles, the savoury language they gave to them that were brought before them. Nay, though Shi∣mei cursed David the king, yet neither did David then or afterward, nor Solomon when he caused him to be put to death, give him any reproachful language, or so much as call him Sirrah, 2 Sam. xvi. and 1 Kings ii.</P>
<P>Read the prophecies of Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, Eze∣kiel, and the rest of the prophets, who prophesied to dif∣ferent people, and against rulers, kings, and magistrates; yet where can it be found, that they had any bad language given them, as Sirrah or the like, by any ruler either of the Jews or Heathens? Nay, though Jeremiah was cast into prison, and into the dungeon, yet there was no such word as Sirrah or Knave given him, Jer. xxxvii.</P>
<P>Respecting the words and carriage of the Heathens. When Abraham was before Abimelech, who was a king, he gave Abraham no unsavoury expressions, Gen. xx. When Isaac came before Abimelech, he gave him no taunting language. Gen. xxvi. When Joseph was cast into prison, and that in Egypt, we do not read he had any railing language given him, Gen. xxxix. Neither did Pharaoh, when Moses and Aaron appeared before him, give them bad language, as Sirrah, Knave or the like.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="037441_0563_100D7F8E0050B040"/>
When Nebuchadnezzar sentenced the three children to the fiery furnace, there was no such language given them as Sirrah, Knave, Rascal; but they were called by the names they were known by, Dan. iii. When Daniel was brought before king Darius, and sentenced to be cast into the lion's den, he had no such ill names given him, as many give now, who call those Heathen rulers, but them∣selves Christians.</P>
<P>If ye look into the New-Testament, in the parable of the wedding-supper, the king that came to view his guests did not say to him that was found without a wedding∣garment, "Sirrah, how camest thou in hither?" but, "Friend, how camest thou in hither?" &amp;c. though he was to be bound hand and foot, and "cast into utter darkness," Matth. xxii. Nay, when Judas had betrayed his master, Jesus Christ, the Lord of Life, and sold him to the priests, Christ did not call him Sirrah, when he came to appre∣hend him, but Friend, Matth. xxvi. 50. Stephen, in his examination, sentence, and death had no such reproachful word given him, as Sirrah or Knave, Acts vi. &amp; vii. chap. When the apostles Peter and John were brought before the high-priest and rulers of the Jews, and commanded not to preach in the name of Jesus, Acts iv. they were not called Sirrahs or Knaves, nor had any such ill names given them. When Paul and Silas were cast into prison by the magistrates, Acts xvi. they called them men, not Rogues, Sirrahs, nor Knaves. And when the magistrates had done contrary to law they feared. So ye may see how short of this example many are that call themselves Christian rulers, who are not afraid to cast innocent peo∣ple into prison, and give them ill names besides, below both Jews and Heathens.</P>
<P>When the uproar was at Ephesus about Diana's shrine, Demetrius, who bore great sway among the craftsmen, did not call Paul Sirrah, but Paul, Acts xix. When Paul was brought prisoner before the high-priest Ananias and the council of the Jews, and told them, <Q>He had lived in all good conscience towards God until that day;</Q> though they, who professed the scriptures but lived out of the life of them, could not abide to hear of living in a good conscience, as professors of the scriptures now, that live not in the life, cannot abide to hear of living in a good conscience now-a-days; but Ananias caused Paul to be "smitten on the mouth;" yet he did not call him Knave
<PB N="48" REF="037441_0564_100D91BD69001030"/>nor Sirrah, Acts xxiii. The apostate Jews indeed, who, though they professed scripture, were out of the life there∣of, and had rejected Christ, in accusing Paul before the Roman magistrates, did once call him a Pestilent Fellow, Acts xxiv. as the accusing professors, who live out of the life, sometimes call us now. But neither Felix, Festus, nor king Agrippa, in all their examinations, gave Paul any such words as Sirrah, Rascal, Knave, or the like, but heard him patiently. So Christians may see through all the scriptures, when persons were brought before rulers, kings, or magistrates, whether Jews or Heathens, they did not use to call them evil names, as Sirrah, Rascal, Knave, and the like. They had no such foul-mouth'd language in their courts. Nor did they use to say to them, <Q>Sirrah, put off your hat.</Q> Now, ye that profess christianity, and say the "scripture is your rule," may see that more corrupt words proceed out of your mouths than either out of the Jews or Heathens, if ye will try your practice by the scriptures; and doth not the apostle tell you, that no corrupt communication should proceed out of your mouths? and that your words should be gracious? I query, Where and whence ye that call yourselves Christi∣ans have got all these bad words and names, seeing neither God nor Christ, the prophets, judges, kings, nor rulers ever gave any such names, so far as appears by scripture, either amongst Heathens, Jews, or Christians?</P>

<P>Before the next affizes there was a quarter-sessions held at Lancaster by the justices. To which, though we were not brought, I put friends upon drawing up an account of their sufferings, and laying them before the justices in their open sessions. For friends had suffered deeply by sines and distresses, the bailiffs and officers making great havoc and spoil of their goods; but no redress was afforded.</P>
<P>And because some evil-minded magistrates would tell us sometimes of the late plot in the north, we gave forth the following paper to stop their mouths, and to clear truth and friends therefrom.</P>
<Q><PB N="49" REF="037441_0565_100D91BFB228F910"/>
<P>A Testimony from the people of God, whom the world calls Quakers, to all the magistrates and officers of what sort soever, from the highest to the lowest.</P>
<P>WE are peaceable, and seek the peace, good, and welfare of all, as in our lives and peaceable carria∣ges is manifested, and we desire the eternal good of all, and their souls everlasting peace. We are become heirs of the blessing before the curse was, and of the power of God before the devil was, and before the fall of man. We are heirs of the gospel of peace, which is the power of God; we are heirs of Christ, who have inherited him and his everlasting kingdom, and do possess the power of an endless life. Knowing this our portion and inherit∣ance, this is to take off all jealousies out of your minds, and out of the minds of all concerning us, that all plots and conspiracies, plotters and conspirators against the king, and all aiders or assisters thereunto we always did and do utterly deny to be of us, or to be of the fellowship of the gospel, of Christ's kingdom, or his servants. For Christ, said, <Q>His kingdom was not of this world, if it were his servants would fight.</Q> 'Therefore he bid Peter, <Q>put up his sword; for,</Q> said he, <Q>he that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword.</Q> Here is the faith and patience of the saints, to bear and suffer all things, knowing venge∣ance is the Lord's, and he will repay it to them that hurt his people and wrong the innocent; therefore cannot we avenge but suffer for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is name's sake. We know that the Lord will judge the world in righteousness according to their deeds, and that, when every one shall give an ac∣count to him of the "deeds done in the body," then will the Lord give every man according to his works, whether they be good or evil. Christ saith, he came not to <Q>destroy men's lives;</Q> and when his disciples would have had "sire to come down from heaven," to have consumed those that did not receive him, he told them, <Q>They knew no what spirit they were of,</Q> they would have men's live destroyed; therefore he rebuked them, and told then <Q>That he came not to destroy men's lives, but to sav them.</Q> We are of Christ's mind, who is the great pro∣phet, whom all ought to hear in all things, who con mandeth his, <Q>If they strike thee on one cheek turn th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, and render to no man evil for evil.</Q> This door trine of his we have learned, and not only confess him i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

The blood of bulls, lambs, rams, and other offerings, and that priest∣hood which offered them, together with other things in the law, were types of Christ, the one offering, and of his blood, who is the everlasting priest and covenant, our life, and way to God, the great prophet and shepherd, the head of his church, and the great bishop of our souls, whom we witness come; he doth oversee and keep his flock. For in Adam, in the fall, we know the striving, quarrel∣ling, unpeaceable spirits are at enmity one with another, and not in peace; but in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, that never fell, is peace, rest, and life. The doctrine of Christ, who never sinned, is to "love one another," and those who are in this doctrine hurt no man, in which we are, in Christ, who is our life. Therefore it is well for you to distinguish betwixt the precious and the vile, be∣tween them that fear God and serve him and them that do not, and to put a difference between the innocent and the 'guilty, between him that is holy and pure and the ungod∣ly and prophane; for they that do not so, bring troubles, burdens, and sorrows upon themselves. This we write in love to your souls, that ye may consider these things; for those that hate enemies, and one another, we cannot say they are of God, nor in Christ's doctrine, but are opposers of it. And such as wrestle with flesh and blood, with carnal weapons, are gone into the flesh out of the Spirit. They are not in our fellowship in the Spirit, in which is the bond of peace, neither are they of us, nor have we unity with them in their fleshly state, and with their carnal weapons. For our unity and fellowship stands in the gospel, which is the power of God, before the devil was, the liar, the murderer, the man-slayer, and the envious. Christ's mind and his doctrine being to save men's lives, we who are of Christ's mind are out of and above these things. Our de∣sire is, that in the fear of the Lord ye may live, that there∣in
<PB N="51" REF="037441_0567_100D91C33120B8A0"/>in ye may receive God's wisdom, by which all things were created, that by it all may be ordered to his glory.</P>
<P>This is from them that love all your souls, and seek your eternal good.</P></Q>
<P>Being prisoner in Lancaster castle, a deep sense came up∣on me of a day of sore trial and exercise that was come and coming upon all who had been high in profession of religion; and I was moved to give forth the following paper as a warning to such:</P>

<P>NOW is the day that every one's faith and love to God and Christ will be tried; who are redeemed out of the earth, and who are in the earth will be mani∣fested; who is the master they serve, and whether they will run to the mountains to cover them. Now will it appear who are the stony-ground, who are the thorny∣ground, and who are the high-way-ground, in whom the fowls of the air take away the seed, the thorns and cares of the world choke, and the heat of persecution scorches and burns up your green blade; for the day trieth all things. Therefore let not such as forsake truth for saving the earth say, that your brother priest only <Q>serveth not the Lord Jesus Christ but his own belly, and mindeth earthly things;</Q> for themselves also do the same, do hug and embrace self and not the Lord. Now it will be made manifest who is every one's God, Christ, and Saviour, and their love will be manifest, whether it be of the world or the love of God; for if it be the love of the world, it is enmity, and the enmity will manifest itself what it is; and the day will try every spirit and his fruits.

So remember me to all friends in the everlasting seed of God. All that are got into fellowship in outward things, their fellowship will corrupt, and wither away.

<P>In the sixth month the assizes were held again at Lancaster, and the same judges, Twisden and Turner, came that cir∣cuit again; but judge Turner then sate on the crown-bench, so I was brought before him. Before I was called to the bar, I was put among murderers and felons for about the space of two hours, the people, the justices, and the judge also gazing upon me. After they had tried several others, they called me to the bar, and impanelled a jury. Then the judge asked the justices, <Q>Whether they had tendered me the oath at the sessions?</Q> They said, 'They had.' Then he bid, <Q>Give them the book, that they might swear they had tendered me the oath at the sessions.</Q> They said, 'They had.' Then the bid, <Q>Give them the book, that they might swear they had tendered me the oath according to the indictment.</Q> Some of the justices refused to be sworn; but the judge said, he would have it done to take away all occasion of exception. When the jury were sworn, and the justices had sworn <Q>they had tendered the oath ac∣cording to the indictment,</Q> the judge asked me, <Q>Whether I had not refused the oath at the last assizes?</Q> I said, <Q>I never took an oath in my life, and Christ, the Saviour and Judge of the World, said, "Swear not at all." The judge seemed not to take notice of my answer; but asked me, Whether or no I had not refused to take the oath at the
<PB N="53" REF="037441_0569_100D91C7120C6838"/>last assize?</Q> I said, <Q>The words that I then spoke to them were, that if they could prove, either judge, justices, priest, or teacher, that after Christ and the apostle had forbidden swearing, they commanded that Christians should swear, I would swear.</Q> The judge said, <Q>He was not at that time to dispute whether it was lawful to swear, but to inquire whether I had refused to take the oath or no.</Q> I told him, <Q>Those things mentioned in the oath, as plotting against the king, and owning the pope's or any other fo∣reign power, I utterly deny.</Q> 'Well,' said he, <Q>you say well in that; but did you deny to take the oath? What say you? What wouldst thou have me to say?</Q> said I, 'for I have told thee before what I did say.' Then he asked me, <Q>If I would have these men to swear that I had taken the oath?</Q> I asked him, <Q>If he would have those men to swear that I had refused the oath?</Q> At which the court burst out into laughter. I was grieved to see so much lightness in a court, where such solemn matters are handled, and thereupon asked him, <Q>If this court was a play-house? Where is gravity and sobriety,</Q> said I; <Q>for this behaviour doth not become you.</Q> Then the clerk read the indict∣ment, and I told the judge, <Q>I had something to speak to it; for I had informed myself of the errors that were in it.</Q> He told me, <Q>He would hear me afterward any reasons that I could allege why he should not give judgment.</Q> Then I spoke to the jury, and told them, <Q>They could not bring me in guilty according to that indictment; for the indict∣ment was wrong laid, and had many gross errors in it.</Q> <Q>The judge said, I must not speak to the jury, but he would speak to them;</Q> and he told them, <Q>I had denied to take the oath at the last assizes, and,</Q> said he, <Q>I can tender the oath to any man now, and premunire him for not taking it; and,</Q> he said, <Q>they must bring me in guil∣ty, seeing I refused to take the oath.</Q> 'Then,' said I, <Q>what do ye do with a form? Ye may throw away your form then.</Q> And I told the jury, <Q>It lay upon their con∣sciences, as they would answer it to the Lord God before his judgment-seat.</Q> Then the judge spoke again to the jury, and I called to him to 'do me justice.' The jury brought me in guilty. Whereupon I told them, <Q>That both the justices and they had forsworn themselves, and 'therefore they had small cause to laugh as they did a little before.</Q> Oh! the envy, rage, and malice, that appeared against me, and the lightness; but the Lord confounded
<PB N="54" REF="037441_0570_100D91C95CDA8150"/>them, and they were wonderfully stopped. So they set me aside, and called up Margaret Fell, who had a great deal of good service amongst them, and then the court broke up near the second hour.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we were brought again to have sentence passed upon us. Margaret Fell desired sentence might be deferred till the next morning. <Q>I desired nothing but law and justice at his hands, for the thieves had mercy; only I requested the judge to send some to see my prison, which was so bad they would put no creature they had in it; and I told him, that colonel Kirby, who was then on the bench, said, <Q>I should be locked up, and no flesh alive should come to me.</Q> The judge shook his head, and said, When the sentence was given, he would leave 'me to the favour of the gaoler.</Q> Most of the gentry of the country were gathered together, expecting to hear the sen∣tence; and the noise amongst the people was, <Q>That I should be transported.</Q> But they were all crossed at that time; for the sentence being deferred till next morning, I was had to prison again. Upon my complaining of the badness of my prison, some of the justices, with colonel Kirby, went up to see it; but when they came, they durst hardly go in, the floor was so bad and dangerous, and the place so open to wind and rain. Some that came up said, 'Sure it was a Jakes-house.' When colonel Kirby saw it, and heard what others said of it, he excused the matter as well as he could, saying, <Q>I should be removed ere it was long to some more convenient place.</Q></P>
<P>Next day, towards the eleventh hour, we were called again to hear the sentence; and Margaret Fell being called first to the bar, she had counsel to plead, who found many errors in her indictment; whereupon, after the judge had acknowledged them, she was set by. Then the judge ask∣ed, 'What they could say to mine?' I was not willing to let any man plead for me, but to speak to it myself; and in∣deed, though Margaret had some that pleaded for her, yet she spoke as much herself as she would. But before I came to the bar, I was moved in my spirit to pray, <Q>That God would confound their wickedness and envy, set his truth over all, and exalt his seed.</Q> The Lord heard and answered, and did confound them in their proceedings against me. And though they had most envy against me, yet the most gross errors were found in my indictment.</P>
<P>I having put by others from pleading for me, the judge
<PB N="55" REF="037441_0571_100D91CAEC184CB0"/>asked me, <Q>What I had to say, why he should not pass sentence upon me?</Q> I told him, <Q>I was no lawyer; but I had much to say if he would but have patience to hear.</Q> At that he laughed, and others laughed also, and said, 'Come, what have you to say? He can say nothing.' 'Yes,' said I, <Q>I have much to say; have but the patience to hear me.</Q></P>
<P>I asked him, <Q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's subjects, or to the subjects of foreign princes?</Q> He said, 'To the subjects of this realm.' Then said I, <Q>Look into the indictment, ye may see that ye have left out the word Subject; so not having named me in the in∣dictment as a subject, ye cannot premunire me for not taking an oath.</Q> Then they looked over the statute and the indictment, and saw it was as I said; and the judge confessed it was an error. I told him, I had something 'else to stop his judgment,' and desired him to look what day the indictment said the oath was tendered to me at the sessions there. They looked, and said, <Q>It was the eleventh day of January.</Q> <Q>What day of the week was the sessions held on?</Q> said I. 'On a Tuesday,' said they. Then said I, <Q>Look your Almanacks, and see whether there was any sessions held at Lancaster on the eleventh day of Ja∣nuary, so called?</Q> So they looked, and found that the eleventh day was the day called Monday, and that the ses∣sions was on the day called Tuesday, which was the twelfth day of that month. 'Look now,' said I, <Q>ye have indicted me for refusing the oath in the quarter-sessions held at Lancaster on the eleventh day of January last, and the justices have sworn that they tendered me the oath in open sessions here that day, and the jury upon their oaths have found me guilty thereupon; and yet ye see there was no session held in Lancaster that day.</Q> Then the judge, to cover the matter, asked, <Q>Whether the sessions did not begin on the eleventh day?</Q> But some in the court an∣swered, <Q>No; the session held but one day, and that was the twelfth.</Q> Then the judge said, <Q>This was a great mistake and an error.</Q> Some of the justices were in a great rage at this, stamped, and said, <Q>Who hath done this? Somebody hath done this on purpose;</Q> and a great heat was amongst them. Then, said I, <Q>Are not the jus∣tices here, that have sworn to this indictment, forsworn men in the face of the country? But this is not all,</Q> said I <Q>I have more yet to offer why sentence should not be
<PB N="56" REF="037441_0572_100D91CCC23C8280"/>given against me.</Q> I asked, <Q>In what year of the king the last assize here was holden, which was in the month called March last?</Q> The judge said, <Q>It was in the six∣teenth year of the king.</Q> 'But,' said I, <Q>the indictment says, it was in the fifteenth year.</Q> They looked, and found it so. This also was acknowledged to be another error. Then they were all in a fret again, and could not tell what to say; for the judge had sworn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered to me at the assize mentioned in the indictment. 'Now,' said I, <Q>is not the court here forsworn also, who have sworn that the oath was tender∣ed to me at the assize holden here in the fifteenth year of the king, when it was in his sixteenth year, and so they have sworn a year false?</Q> The judge bid them look whe∣ther Margaret Fell's indictment was so or no. They look∣ed, and found it was not so. I told the judge, <Q>I had more yet to offer to stop sentence;</Q> and asked him. <Q>Whe∣ther all the oath ought to be put into the indictment or no?</Q> 'Yes,' said he, 'it ought to be all put in.' 'Then,' said I, <Q>compare the indictment with the oath, and there thou mayest see these words; viz. [or by any authority de∣rived, or pretended to be derived from him or his see] left out of the indictment, which is a principal part of the oath; and in another place the words [heirs and successors] are left out.</Q> The judge acknowledged these also to be great errors. 'But,' said I, 'I have something further to allege.' 'Nay,' said the judge, 'I have enough, you need say no more.' 'If,' said I, <Q>thou hast enough, I desire nothing but law and justice at thy hands; for I don't look for mercy.</Q> <Q>You must have justice,</Q> said he, 'and you shall have law.' Then I asked, <Q>Am I at liberty, and free from all that ever hath been done against me in this matter?</Q> 'Yes,' said the judge, <Q>you are free from all that hath been done against you. But then,</Q> starting up in a rage, he said, <Q>I can put the oath to any man here, and I will tender you the oath again.</Q> I told him, <Q>He had examples enough yesterday of swearing and false-swearing. both in the justi∣ces and in the jury; for I saw before mine eyes that both justices and jury had forsworn themselves.</Q> The judge asked me, 'If I would take the oath?' I answered. Do me <Q>justice for my false imprisonment all this while; for what have I been imprisoned so long for? I told him, I ought to be set at liberty.</Q> 'You are at liberty,' said he, <Q>but I will put the oath to you again.</Q> Then I turned about,
<PB N="57" REF="037441_0573_100D91CF75D3A5D8"/>and said, <Q>All people, take notice this is a snare, for I ought to be set free from the gaoler and from this court.</Q> But the judge cried, 'Give him the book,' and the sheriff and the justices cried, 'Give him the book.' Then the power of darkness rose up in them, like a mountain, and a clerk lifted up a book to me. I stood still, and said, <Q>If it be a Bible, give it me into my hand.</Q> 'Yes, yes,' said the judge and justices, 'give it him into his hand.' <Q>So I took it, and looked into it, and said, I see it is a Bible, I am glad of it.</Q> He had caused the jury to be called, and they stood by; for after they had brought in their former verdict, he would not dismiss them though they desired it, but told them, <Q>He could not dismiss them yet, he should have bu∣siness for them; therefore they must attend, and be ready when they were called.</Q> When he said so, I felt his intent, that if I was freed, he would come on again. So I looked him in the face, and the witness of God started up in him, and made him blush when he looked at me again; for he saw that I discovered him. Nevertheless hardening himself, he caused the oath to be read to me, the jury standing by. When it was read, he asked me, <Q>Whether I would take the oath or no?</Q> Then said I, <Q>Ye have given me a book here to kiss, and to swear on; and this book which ye have given me to kiss, says, "Kiss the Son;" and the Son says in this book, "Swear not at all;" and so says also the apostle James. I say as the book says, yet ye imprison me. How chance ye do not imprison the book for saying so? How comes it that the book is at liberty among you, which bids me not to swear, and yet ye imprison me for do∣ing as the book bids me?</Q> I was speaking this to them, and held up the Bible open in my hand, to shew them the place where Christ forbad swearing, they plucked the book out of my hand, and the judge said, <Q>Nay, but we will im∣prison George Fox.</Q> Yet this got abroad over all the country as a by-word, <Q>That they gave me a book to swear on that commanded the "not to swear at all;" and that the Bible was at liberty, and I in prison for doing as the Bible said.</Q> When the judge still urged me to swear, I told him, <Q>I never took oath, covenant, nor engagement in my life; but my yea, or nay was more binding to me than an oath was to many others; for had they not had ex∣perience how little men regarded an oath? and how they had sworn one way and then another? and how the justices and court had forsworn themselves now? I told him, I.
<PB N="58" REF="037441_0574_100D91D169208C98"/>was a man of a tender conscience, and if they had any sense of a tender conscience, they would consider, that it was in obedience to Christ's command that I could not swear. But,</Q> said I, <Q>if any of you can convince me, that, after Christ and the apostle had commanded not to swear, they altered that command, and commanded Christians to swear, ye shall see I will swear.</Q> There being many priests by, I said, <Q>If ye cannot do it, let your priests stand up and do it.</Q> But not one of the priests made answer. 'Oh!' said the judge, 'all the world cannot convince you.' 'No,' said I, <Q>how is it like the world should convince me? "The whole world lies in wickedness." Bring out your spiritual men, as ye call them, to convince me.</Q> Then both the sheriff and the judge said, <Q>The angels swore in the Revelations.</Q> I replied, <Q>When God bringeth his first-be∣gotten Son into the world, he saith, "Let all the angels "of God worship him;" and he saith, "Swear not at all." Nay,</Q> said the judge, 'I will not dispute.' Then I spoke to the jury, telling them, <Q>It was for Christ's sake that I could not swear, and therefore I warned them not to act contrary to that of God in their consciences; for before his judgment seat they must all be brought.</Q> I told them, <Q>As for plots, and persecution for religion and popery, I deny them in my heart; for I am a Christian, and shall shew forth Christianity amongst you this day. It is for Christ's doctrine I stand.</Q> More words I had both with the judge and jury before the gaoler took me away.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I was brought up again, and put among the thieves a pretty while, where I stood with my hat on till the gaoler took it off. Then the jury having found this new indictment against me 'for not taking the oath,' I was called to the bar, and the judge asked me, <Q>What I would say for myself?</Q> I bid them read the indictment, for I would not answer to that which I did not hear. The clerk read it, and as he read the judge said, <Q>Take heed it be not false again;</Q> but he read it in such a manner, that I could hardly understand what he read. When he had done, the judge asked me, 'What I said to the indictment?' I told him, <Q>At once hearing so large a writing read, and that at such a distance, that I could not distinctly hear all the parts of it, I could not well tell what to say to it; but if he would let me have a copy of it, and give me time to consider of it, I should answer it.</Q> This put them to a little stand; but after awhile the judge asked me, <Q>What time I would
<PB N="59" REF="037441_0575_100D91D2FA916498"/>have?</Q> I said, 'Till the next assize.' 'But,' said he, <Q>what plea will ye now make? Are ye guilty, or not guilty?</Q> I said, <Q>I am not guilty at all of denying to swear obstinately and wilfully; and as for those things mentioned in the oath, as jesuitical plots and foreign powers, I utterly deny them in my heart. If I could take any oath I should take that; but I never took any oath in my life.</Q> The judge answer∣ed, 'I said well; but,' said he, <Q>the king is sworn, the par∣liament is sworn, I am sworn, and the justices are sworn, and the law is preserved by oaths.</Q> I told him, <Q>They had sufficient experience of men's swearing, and he had seen how the justices and jury had sworn wrong the other day; and if he had read in the book of martyrs how many of them had refused to swear, both in the time of the ten persecutions and in bishop Bonner's days, he might see, that to deny swearing in obedience to Christ's command was no new thing.</Q> He said, 'He wished the laws were otherwise.' I said, <Q>Our yea is yea, and our nay is nay; and if we transgress our yea or our nay, let us suffer as they do, or should do, that swear falsely.</Q> This, I told him, we had offered to the king, and the king said, 'It was reasonable.'</P>
<P>After some further discourse, they committed me to pri∣son again, there to lie till the next assize; and colonel Kir∣by gave order to the gaoler, <Q>To keep me close, and suffer no flesh alive to come at me; for I was not fit,</Q> he said, 'to be discoursed with by men.' I was put into a tower, where the smoke of the other prisoners came up so thick, it stood as dew upon the walls, and sometimes it was so thick that I could hardly see the candle when it burned; and I being locked under three locks, the under-gaoler, when the smoke was great, would hardly be persuaded to come up to unlock one of the uppermost doors, for fear of the smoke, so that I was almost smothered. Besides it rained in upon my bed, and many times, when I went to stop out the rain in the cold winter-season, my shirt was as wet as muck with the rain that came in upon me while I was labouring to stop it out. And the place being high and open to the wind, sometimes as fast as I stopped it the wind blew it out again. In this manner did I lay all that long cold winter till the next assize, in which time I was so starved with cold and rain, that my body was greatly swelled, and my limbs much benumbed.</P>
<P>The assize began the sixteenth of the month called March 1661-5. The same judges, Twisden and Turner, coming,
<PB N="60" REF="037441_0576_100D91D48FFF7968"/>that circuit again, judge Twisden sat this time on the crown∣bench, and before him I was brought. I had informed my∣self of the errors in this indictment also. For though at the assize before, judge Turner said to the officers in court, <Q>Pray, see that all the oath be in the indictment, and that the word Subject be in, and that the day of the month and year of the king be put in right; for it is a shame that so many errors should be seen and found in the face of the country;</Q> yet many errors, and those great ones, were in this indictment as well as in the former. Surely the hand of the Lord was in it, to confound their mischievous work against me, and to blind them therein; insomuch that al∣though, after the indictment was drawn at the former assize, the judge examined it himself, and tried it with the clerks, yet the word Subject was left out of this indictment also, the day of the month was put in wrong, and several mate∣rial words of the oath were left out; yet they went on con∣sidently against me, thinking all was safe and well. When I was set to the bar, and the jury called over to be sworn, the clerk asked me, first, <Q>Whether I had any objection to make to any of the jury?</Q> I told him, <Q>I knew none of them.</Q> Then, having sworn the jury, they swore three of the officers of the court, to prove, <Q>That the oath was tendered to me at the last assizes, according to the indict∣ment.</Q> 'Come, come,' said the judge, <Q>it was not done in a corner.</Q> Then he asked me, <Q>What I had to say to it; or whether I had taken the oath at the last assize?</Q> I told him what I had formerly said to them, as it now came to my remembrance. Whereupon the judge said, <Q>I will not dispute with you but in point of law.</Q> 'Then,' said I, <Q>I have something to speak to the jury concerning the indictment.</Q> He told me, <Q>I must not speak to the jury; but if I had any thing to say, I must speak to him.</Q> I asked him, <Q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's subjects only, or to the subjects of foreign princes?</Q> He replied, <Q>To the subjects of this realm; for I will speak nothing to you,</Q> said he, 'but in point of law.' 'Then,' said I, <Q>look in the indictment, and thou mayest see the word Subject is left out of this indictment also. There∣fore, seeing the oath is not to be tendered to any but the subjects of this realm, and ye have not put me in as a subject, the court is to take no notice of this indictment.</Q> I had no sooner spoke thus, but the judge cried, <Q>Take him away, gaoler, take him away.</Q> So I was presently
<PB N="61" REF="037441_0577_100D91D6D3655CD0"/>hurried away. The gaoler and people looked when I should be called for again; but I was never brought to the court any more, though I had many other great errors to assign in the indictment. After I was gone, the judge asked the jury, 'If they were agreed?' They said, 'Yes;' and found for the king against me, as I was told. But I was never called to hear sentence given, nor was any given against me that I could hear of. I understand, when they looked narrowly into the indictment, they saw it was not good; and the judge having sworn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered me at the assize before, such a day, according as was set in the indictment, and that being the wrong day, I should have proved the officers of the court forsworn men again, if the judge would have suffered me to plead to the indictment; which was thought to be the reason why he hurried me away so soon. The judge had passed sentence of premunire upon Margaret Fell be∣fore I was brought in; and it seems, when I was hurried away, they recorded me as a premunired person, though I was never brought to hear the sentence, nor knew of it; which was very illegal. For they ought not only to have had me present to hear the sentence given, but also to have asked me first, <Q>What I could say why sentence should not be given against me?</Q> But they knew I had so much to say they could not give sentence if they heard me.</P>
<P>While I was prisoner in Lancaster castle, there was great noise and talk of the Turk's overspreading Christendom, and great fears entered many. But one day, as I was walk∣ing in my prison-chamber, <Q>I saw the Lord's power turn against him, and that he was turning back again.</Q> I de∣clared to some what the Lord had let me see, when there were such fears of his over-running Christendom; and with∣in a month after the news came down, wherein it was men∣tioned, 'They had given him a defeat.'</P>
<P>Another time, as I was walking in my chamber, with my eye to the Lord, <Q>I saw the angel of the Lord, with a glit∣tering drawn sword stretched southward, as though the court had been all on a fire.</Q> Not long after the wars broke out with Holland, the sickness broke forth, and after∣wards the fire of London; so the Lord's sword was drawn indeed.</P>
<P>By reason of my long and close imprisonment in so bad a place, I was become very weak of body; but the Lord's power was over all, supported me through all, and enabled
<PB N="62" REF="037441_0578_100D91D935D0CB60"/>me to do service for him, and for his truth and people, as the place would admit. For while I was in Lancaster pri∣son, I answered several books, as the Mass, the Common∣prayer, the Directory, and the Church-faith; which are the four chief religions that are got up since the apostles days. And there being several friends in prison at Lancaster and other prisons for not paying tithes, I was moved to publish the following lines concerning tithes:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>IN the time of the law, those that did not bring their tithes into the store-house robbed God; then there was not meat in their house; therefore the Lord commanded, <Q>To bring them into his house, that there might be meat in the store-house, which was to feed the fatherless, stranger, and widow.</Q> But these priests who are counterfeits, who take people's tithes now by a law, are from the beast; and if they will not pay them they prison them, or make them pay treble. These rob the, poor, rob the fatherless, and the stranger and widow are not filled; so their cry is gone up to heaven against these. Many are made almost beg∣gars by these oppressing priests, their cattle and corn being taken away from them, and they cast into prison. Others are sued at law by the priests, and have treble damage ta∣ken from them; yet such priests are cried up to be minis∣ters of the gospel. Though when the unchangeable priest was come, the priesthood that was changeable was denied, as we now deny these. But if any be moved to cry against them, they are stocked, beat, or imprisoned. Many are now in prison at Lancaster and other places by a national law, the like whereof was never done by the law of God delivered to Moses. We do not read that under Moses's law any suffered imprisonment, or spoiling of goods for not paying tithes, or was to pay treble damage. Surely, sure∣ly, the cry for vengeance will be heard, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es from the oppressed souls that lie under the altar. There are many prisoners at Kendal, because they cannot pay tithes, as captain Ward, Thomas Robertson, and the widow Garland, who hath many small children: these suffer be∣cause they cannot pay tithes. Others there are in Kendal prison, who were moved of the Lord to speak to the priests, whereof one was moved to go in sackcloth, and of late with ashes upon her head. Others have been moved to go in sackcloth, as a lamentation for the miserable estate of this nation, seeing so many crying up of the preaching of the
<PB N="63" REF="037441_0579_100D91DB242A0A98"/>gospel, and yet so much strife, debate, oaths, and dissen∣sion among people. But where the gospel is received in∣deed, strife and contention are ended, and oppression is taken off. Oh! the land mourns, because of the oppres∣sion of those called ministers! And though the cry of the oppressed hath not entered into the ears of the magistrates, yet is the cry of the poor oppressed people of God entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath, who now will be avenged of all his adversaries. You unjust law-givers, and unjust judges, to that in all your consciences I speak, to be cleared, when ye are judged by the just judge of hea∣ven and earth; whose terror is gone forth against all the ungodly, and all the oppressors of God's people whatsoe∣ver, whether ye will hear or forbear.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After the assize, colonel Kirby and other justices were very uneasy with my being at Lancaster; for I had galled them sore at my trials there, and they laboured much to get me removed from thence to some remote place. Colonel Kirby threatened I should be sent far enough; sometimes he said, 'I should be sent beyond sea.' About six weeks after the assizes, they got an order from the king and coun∣cil to remove me from Lancaster; and with it they brought a letter from the earl of Anglesey, wherein was written, <Q>That if those things were found true against me, which I was charged withal, I deserved no clemency nor mercy;</Q> yet the greatest matter they had against me was, because I could not disobey the command of Christ, and swear.</P>
<P>When they had prepared for my removal, the under∣sheriff and the head-sheriff's man, with some bailiffs, came and fetched me out of the castle, when I was so weak with lying in that cold, wet, and smoky prison, that I could hardly go or stand. They had me into the gaoler's house, where was William Kirby and several others, and they cal∣led for wine to give me. I told them, <Q>I would have none of their wine.</Q> Then they cried, 'Bring out the horses.' I desired them first to shew me their order, or a copy of it, if they intended to remove me; but they would shew me none but their swords. I told them, <Q>There was no sen∣tence passed upon me, nor was I premunired, that I knew of; and therefore I was not made the king's prisoner, but was the sheriff's; for they and all the country knew, that I was not fully heard at the last assize, nor suffered to
<PB N="64" REF="037441_0580_100D91DD87B484D8"/>shew the errors in the indictment, which were sufficient to quash it, though they had kept me from one assize to an∣other, to the end they might try me. But they all knew there was no sentence of premunire passed upon me; therefore I, not being the king's prisoner but the sheriff's, did desire to see their order.</Q> Instead of shewing me their order, they haled me out, and lifted me upon one of the sheriff's horses. When I was on horseback in the street, the town's people being gathered to gaze upon me, I told the officers, I had received neither Christianity, civility, nor humanity from them. They hurried me away about four∣teen miles to Bentham, though I was so very weak that I was hardly able to sit on horseback, and my cloaths smelt so of smoke they were loathsome to myself. The wicked gaoler, one Hunter, a young fellow, would come behind and give the horse a lash with his whip, and make him skip and leap; so that I, being weak, had much ado to sit on him; then he would come and look me in the face, and say, 'How do you, Mr. Fox?' I told him, <Q>It was not civil in him to do so.</Q> The Lord cut him off soon after.</P>
<P>When we were come to Bentham in Yorkshire, there met us many troopers and a marshal; and many of the gentry of the country were come in, and abundance of people to take a view of me. I being very weak and weary, desired them to let me lie down on a bed, which the soldiers per∣mitted; for those that brought me thither gave their order to the marshal, and he set a guard of his soldiers upon me. When they had staid awhile, they pressed horses, raised the bailiff of the hundred, the constables, and others, and had me to Giggleswick that night; but exceeding weak I was. There they raised the constables with their clog-shoes, who sat drinking all the night in the room by me, so that I could not get much rest. Next day we came to a market-town, where several friends came to see me. Robert Widders and divers friends came to me upon the road. The next night I asked the soldiers, <Q>Whither they intended to carry me, and whither I was to be sent?</Q> Some of them said, <Q>Be∣yond sea,</Q> others said, 'To Tinmouth-castle.' And a great fear there was amongst them, lest some should rescue me out of their hands; but that fear was needless. Next night we came to York, where the marshal put me up into a great chamber, where there came most part of two troops to see me. One of those oopers, an envious man, hearing I was premunired, asked me, <Q>What estate I had, and
<PB N="65" REF="037441_0581_100D91DF7649D7A8"/>whether it was copy-hold or free-land?</Q> I took no notice of his question, but was moved to declare the word of life to the soldiers, and many of them were very loving. At night lord Frecheville, who commanded those horse, came to me, and was very civil and loving. I gave him an ac∣count of my imprisonment, and declared many things to him relating to truth. They kept me at York two days, then the marshal and four or five soldiers were sent to con∣vey me to Scarborough castle. Indeed these were very ci∣vil men, and carried themselves civilly and lovingly to me. On the way we baited at Malton, and they permitted friends to come and visit me. When we were come to Scarborough, they had me to an inn, and gave notice to the governor, who sent half a dozen soldiers to be my guard that night. Next day they conducted me to the castle, put me into a room, and set a centry on me. I being very weak, and subject to fainting, they for awhile let me go out some∣times into the air with a centry. They soon removed me out of this room, and put me into an open room, where the rain came in; and the room smoked exceedingly, which was very offensive to me. One day the governor, who was call∣ed Sir Jordan Crosland, came to see me, and brought with him one called Sir Francis Cobb. I desired the governor to go into my room, and see what a place I had. I had got a little fire made in it, and the room was so filled with smoke, that when they were in they could hardly find their way out again. He being a Papist, I told him that was his purgatory which they had put me into. I was forced to lay out about fifty shillings to stop out the rain, and keep the room from smoking so much. When I had been at that charge, and made it somewhat tolerable, they removed me into a worse, where I had neither chimney nor fire-hearth. This being to the sea-side, and lying much open, the wind drove in the rain forcibly, so that the water came over my bed, and ran about the room, that I was fain to skim it up with a platter. And when my clothes were wet, I had no fire to dry them; so my body was numbed with cold, and my fingers swelled, that one was grown as big as two. Though I was at some charge on this room also, yet I could not keep out the wind and rain. Besides they would suffer few friends to come at me, and many times not any, not so much as to bring me a little food; but I was forced for the first quarter, to hire one of another society to bring me ne∣cessaries. Sometimes the soldiers would take it from her,
<PB N="66" REF="037441_0582_100D91E1C7ACAD08"/>and she would scuffle with them for it. Afterwards I hired a soldier to fetch me water and bread, and something to make a fire of, when I was in a room where a fire could be made. Commonly a three-penny loaf served me three weeks, and sometimes longer, and most of my drink was water, with wormwood steeped or bruised in it. One time, when the weather was very sharp, and I had taken a great cold, I got a little elecampane-beer; and I heard one of the soldiers say to the other, <Q>They would play me a pretty trick, for they would send for me up to the deputy-governor, and in the mean time drink my strong beer out;</Q> and so they did. When I returned, one of the soldiers came to me in a jeer, and asked me for some strong beer. I told him, They had played their pretty trick, and took no far∣ther-notice of it. But inasmuch as they kept me so very strait, not giving liberty for friends to come to me, I spoke to the keepers of the castle to this effect: <Q>I did not know till I was removed from Lancaster castle, and brought pri∣soner to this castle of Scarborough, that I was convicted of a premunire; for the judge did not give sentence upon me at the assizes in open court. But seeing I am now a prisoner here, if I may not have my liberty, let my friends and acquaintance have their liberty to come and visit me, as Paul's friends had among the Romans, who were not Christians but Heathens. For Paul's friends had their li∣berty; all that would might come to him, and he had his liberty to preach to them in his hired house; but I cannot have liberty to go into the town, nor for my friends to come to me here. So you, that go under the name of Chris∣tians, are worse in this respect than those Heathens were.</Q></P>
<P>But though they would not let friends come to me, they would often bring others, either to gaze upon me or to con∣tend with me.</P>
<P>One time came a great company of Papists to discourse with me, who affirmed, <Q>The pope was infallible, and had stood infallible ever since Peter's time.</Q> I shewed them the contrary by history: <Q>For one of the bishops of Rome, Marcellinus by name, denied the faith, and sa∣crificed to idols; therefore he was not infallible. I told them, if they were in the Infallible Spirit, they need not have gaols, swords, staves, racks, tortures, fires, whips, and gallows, to hold up their religion by, and to destroy men's lives about religion; for if they were in the Infalli∣ble Spirit, they would preserve men's lives, and use none
<PB N="67" REF="037441_0583_100D91E36410ECE8"/>but spiritual weapons about religion. I told them also what one that had been of their society told me. A wo∣man lived in Kent, who had not only been a Papist her∣self, but had brought over several to that religion; but coming to be convinced of God's truth, and being turned by it to Christ, her Saviour, she exhorted the Papists to the same. One of them, a taylor, being at work at her house, while she opened to him the falseness of the Popish religion, and endeavoured to draw him from it to the truth, drew his knife, and got between her and the door. But she spoke boldly to him, and bid him put up his knife, for she knew his principle. I asked the woman, What she thought he would have done with his knife? She said, "He would have stabbed her." "Stab thee!" said I, <Q>What would he have stabbed thee for? thy reli∣gion?</Q> "Yes," said she, <Q>It is the principle of the Pa∣pists, if any turn from their religion, to kill them if they can.</Q> This story I told those Papists, and that I had it from a person who had been one of them. but had forsook their principles, and discovered their practices. They did not deny this to be their principle, but said, What! would I declare this abroad? I told them, Yes, such things ought to be declared abroad, that it might be known how con∣trary their religion was to true Christianity;</Q> whereupon they went away in a great rage.</P>
<P>Another Papist came to discourse with me, who said, <Q>All the patriarchs were in hell from the creation till Christ came, and that when Christ suffered he went into hell, and the devil said to him, What comest thou hither for, to break open our strong bolds? And Christ said, To fetch them all out. So,</Q> he said, <Q>Christ was three days and three nights in hell to bring them out.</Q> I told him, that was false; for Christ said to the thief, <Q>This day thou shalt be with the in paradise.</Q> And Enoch and Elijah were translated into heaven. And Abraham was in heaven: for the scripture saith, <Q>Lazarus was in his bosom; and Moses and Elias were with Christ upon the mount before he suffered.</Q> These instances stopped the Papist's mouth, and put him to a stand.</P>
<P>Another time came Dr. Witty, who was esteemed a great doctor in physick, with lord Falconbridge, the governor of Tinmouth castle, and several knights. I being called to them, Witty undertook to discourse with me, and asked me, 'What I was in prison for?' I told him, <Q>Because I
<PB N="68" REF="037441_0584_100D91E559D53090"/>would not disobey the command of Christ, and swear.</Q> He said, 'I ought to swear my allegiance to the king.' He being a great Presbyterian, I asked him, <Q>Whether he had not sworn against the king and house of lords, and taken the Scotch covenant? And had he not since sworn to the king? What then was his swearing good for? But my allegiance,</Q> I told him, <Q>did not consist in swearing, but in truth and faithfulness.</Q> After some further dis∣course, I was had away to my prison again; and afterwards Dr. Witty boasted in the town amongst his patients, that he had conquered me. When I heard of it, I told the governor, <Q>It was a small boast in him to say, He had con∣quered a bondman.</Q> I desired to bid him come to me again, when he came to the castle. He came again awhile after, with about sixteen or seventeen great persons, and then he ran himself worse on ground than before. For he affirmed before them all, <Q>That Christ had not enlightened every man that cometh into the world;</Q> and <Q>that the grace of God, that brought salvation, had not appeared unto all men, and that Christ had not died for all men.</Q> I asked him, what sort of men those were which Christ had not enlightened? and whom his grace had not appeared to? and whom he had not died for? He said, <Q>Christ did not die for adulterers, and idolaters, and wicked men.</Q> I ask∣ed him, <Q>Whether adulterers and wicked men were not sinners?</Q> He said, 'Yes.' 'Did not Christ die for sin∣ners?' 'said I. 'Did he not come to call sinners to re∣pentance?' 'Yes,' said he. 'Then,' said I, <Q>thou hast stopped thy own mouth.</Q> So I proved, that the grace of God had appeared unto all men, though some turned from it into wantonness, and walked despitefully against it; and that Christ had enlightened all men, though some hated the light. Several of the people confessed it was true; but he went away in a great rage, and came no more to me.</P>
<P>Another time the governor brought a priest; but his mouth was soon stopped. Not long after he brought two or three parliament-men, who asked me, <Q>Whether I did own ministers and bishops?</Q> I told them, <Q>Yes, such as Christ sent, such as had freely received, and would freely give, such as were qualified, and were in the same power and spirit the apostles were in. But such bishops and teachers as theirs, that would go no farther than a great benefice, I did not own; for they were not like the apos∣tles. Christ saith to his ministers, <Q>Go ye into all na∣tions,
<PB N="69" REF="037441_0585_100D91E7A2CBDA28"/>and preach the gospel;</Q> but ye parliament-men, <Q>who keep your priests and bishops in such great fat benefi∣ces, have spoiled them all. For do ye think they will go into all nations to preach? or will go any farther than a great fat benefice? Judge yourselves whether they will or no.</Q></Q></P>
<P>There came another time the widow of old lord Fairfax, and with her a great company; one of whom was a priest. I was moved to declare the truth to them, and the priest ask∣ed me, <Q>Why we said Thou and Thee to people? for he counted us but fools and idiots for speaking so.</Q> I asked him, <Q>Whether those that translated the scriptures, and made the grammar and accidence, were fools and idiots, seeing they translated the scriptures so, and made the grammar so, Thou to one, and You to more than one, and left it so to us? If they were fools and idiots, why had not he and such as he, who looked upon themselves as wise men, and could not bear Thou and Thee to a singular, altered the grammar, accidence, and bible, and put the plural instead of the singular? But if they were wise men, that so translated the bible, and made the grammar and acci∣dence so, I wished him to consider, whether they were not fools and idiots themselves, that did not speak as their grammars and bibles taught them; but were offended with us, and called us fools and idiots for speaking so?</Q> Thus the priest's mouth was stopped, many of the compa∣ny acknowledged the truth, and were pretty loving and ten∣der. Some would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</P>
<P>After this came Dr. Cradock, with three priests more, and the governor with his lady (so called) and another that was called a lady, with a great company. Dr. Cradock asked me, 'What I was in prison for?' I told him, <Q>For obeying the command of Christ and the apostle, in not swearing. But if he, being both a doctor and a justice, could convince me, that after Christ and the apostle had forbid swearing, they commanded Christians to swear, then I would swear. Here was the bible, I told him, he might if he could shew me any such command.</Q> He said. <Q>It is written, ye shall swear in truth and righteousness.</Q> 'Aye.' <Q>said I, 'it was written so in Jeremiah's time; but that was many ages before Christ commanded not to swear at all; but where is it written so since Christ forbad all swearing? I could bring as many instances out of the Old Testament
<PB N="70" REF="037441_0586_100D91E99378B5F0"/>for swearing as thou, and it may be more; but of what force are they to prove swearing lawful in the New Testa∣ment since Christ and the apostle forbad it? Besides,</Q> said I, <Q>in that text where it is written, "Ye shall swear," what [Ye] was this? Was it Ye Gentiles, or Ye Jews?</Q> To this he would not answer; but one of the priests that were with him answered. <Q>It was to the Jews that this was spo∣ken.</Q> Then Dr. Cradock confessed it was so.' 'Very well,' said I, <Q>but where did God ever give a command to the Gentiles to swear? For thou knowest that we are Gentiles by nature.</Q> 'Indeed,' said he, <Q>in the gospel-times every thing was to be established out of the mouths of two or three witnesses; but there was to be no swearing then.</Q> 'Why then,' said I, <Q>dost thou force oaths upon Christi∣ans, contrary to thy own knowledge, in the gospel-times? And why,</Q> said I, 'dost thou excommunicate my friends?' (for he had excommunicated abundance both in Yorkshire and Lancashire.) He said, 'For not coming to church.' 'Why,' said I, <Q>ye left us above twenty years ago, when we were but young lads and lasses, to the Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists, many of whom made spoil of our goods, and persecuted us because we would not follow them. We being but young, knew little then of your principles, and the old men that did know them, if ye had intended to have kept them to you, and have kept your principles alive, that we might have known them, ye should either not have fled from us as ye did, or ye should have sent us your epistles, collects, homilies, and evening songs; for Paul wrote epistles to the saints, though he was in prison. But they and we might have turned Turks or Jews for any collects, homilies, or epistles we had from you all this while. And now thou hast excommunicated 'us, both young and old, and so have others of you done; that is, <Q>Ye have put us out of your church, before ye have got us into it,</Q> and before ye have brought us to know your principles. Is not this madness in you, to put us out before we were brought in? Indeed, if ye had brought us into your church, and when we had been in, if we had done some bad thing, that had been something like a ground for excommunication or putting out again. But,' said I, 'What dost thou call the church?' 'Why,' said he, 'that which you call the steeple-house,' Then I afted him, 'Whether Christ shed his blood for the steeple-house? and purchased and sanctified the steeple-house
<PB N="71" REF="037441_0587_100D91EB2391E560"/>with his blood? And seeing the church is Christ's bride and wife, and that he is the head of the church, dost thou think the steeple-house is Christ's wife and bride, and that he is the head of that old house, or of his people? No,</Q> said he, <Q>Christ is the head of his people, and they are the church.</Q> 'But,' said I, <Q>you have given the title church to an old house, which belongs to the people; and you have taught them to believe so.</Q> I asked him also, <Q>Why he persecuted friends for not paying tithes? And whether God ever commanded the Gentiles to pay tithes? And whether Christ had not ended tithes when he ended the Levitical priesthood that took tithes? And whether Christ, when he sent his disciples to preach, had not commanded them to preach freely as he had given them freely? And whether all the ministers of Christ are not bound to observe this command of Christ?</Q> He said, 'He would not dispute 'that.' Neither did I find he was willing to stay on that sub∣ject; for he presently turned to another matter, and said, <Q>You marry, but I know not how.</Q> I replied, <Q>It may be so: but why dost thou not come and see?</Q> Then he <Q>threatened that he would use his power against us, as he had done.</Q> I bid him. 'Take heed; for he was an old man.' I asked him also, <Q>Where he read from Genesis to Revelations, that ever any priest did marry any? I wished him to shew me some instance thereof, if he would have us come to them to be married; for, said I, thou hast excommunicated one of my friends two years after he was dead, about his mar∣riage. And why dost thou not excommunicate Isaac, and Jacob, and Boaz, and Ruth? For we do not read they were ever married by the priests; but they took one ano∣ther in the assemblies of the righteous, in the presence of God and his people; and so do we. So that we have all the holy men and women, that the scripture speaks of in this practice, on our side.</Q> Much discourse we had; but when he found he could get no advantage on me, he went away with his company.</P>
<P>With such people I was much exercised while I was there; for most that came to the castle would desire to speak with me, and great disputes I had with them. But as to friends, I was as a man buried alive; for though many came far to see me, few were suffered to come at me; and when any friend came into the castle about business, if he looked but towards me, they would rage at him. At last the governor came under trouble himself; for having sent
<PB N="72" REF="037441_0588_100D91ED1BD2E108"/>out a privateer to sea, they took some ships that were not enemies ships, but their friends; whereupon he was brought into trouble; after which he grew somewhat more friendly to me. For before I had a marshal set over me, on pur∣pose to get money out of me; but I was not to give him a farthing; and when they found they could get nothing from me, he was taken off again. The officers often threatered me, that I should be hanged over the wall. Nay, the de∣puty-governor told me once, that the king, knowing I had great interest in the people had sent me thither; that if there should be any stirring in the nation, they should hang m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over the wall to keep the people down. There being awhile after a marriage at a Papist's house, upon which occasion a great many of them were met together, they talked much then of hanging me. But I told them, <Q>If that was what they desired, and it was permitted them, I was ready; for I never feared death nor sufferings in my life; but I was known to be an innocent, peaceable man, free from all stirrings and plottings, and one that sought the good of all men.</Q> Afterwards, the governor growing kinder, I spoke to him, when he was to go to London to the parliament. and desired him to speak to 'squire Marsh, Sir Francis Cobb, and some others; and let them know how long I had lain in prison, and for what: which he did. When he came down again, he told me, 'squire Marsh said, <Q>He would go an hundred miles barefoot for my liberty, he knew me so well;</Q> and several others, he said, spoke well of me. From which time the governor was very loving to me.</P>
<P>There were amongst the prisoners two very bad men, who often fat drinking with the officers and soldiers; and because I would not sit and drink with them, it made them the worse against me. One time, when these two prisoners were drunk, one of them (whose name was William Wil∣kinson, a Presbyterian, who had been a captain) came and challenged me to fight with him. I seeing what condition he was in, got out of his way; and next morning, when he was more sober, shewed him, <Q>How unmanly a thing it was in him to challenge a man to fight, whose principle, he knew it, was not to strike; but if he was stricken on one ear, to turn the other. I told him, if he had a mind to fight, he should have challenged some of the soldiers, that could have answered him in his own way. But however, seeing he had challenged me, I was now come to answer
<PB N="73" REF="037441_0589_100D91EF82E2EC10"/>him, with my hands in my pockets: and (reaching my head towards him) Here said I, here is my hair, here are my cheeks, here is my back.</Q> With that he sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pped away from me, and went into another room: at which the sol∣diers fell a laughing; and one of the officers said, <Q>You are a happy man that can bear such things.</Q> Thus he was conquered without a blow. After awhile he took the oath, gave bond, got out of prison; and not long after the Lord cut him off.</P>
<P>There were great imprisonments in this and the former years, while I was prisoner at Lancaster and Scarborough. At London many friends were crowded into Newgate, and other prisons, where the sickness was; and many died in prison. Many also were banished, and several sent on ship∣board by the king's order. Some masters of ships would not carry them, but set them on shore again; yet some were sent to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and Mevis, and the Lord bles∣sed them there. One master of a ship was very wicked and cruel to friends that were put on board his ship; for he kept them down under decks, though the sickness was amongst them; so that many died of it. But the Lord visited him for his wickedness; for he lost most of his seamen by the plague, and lay several months crossed with contrary winds, though other ships went out, and made their voyages. At last he came before Plymouth, where the governor and ma∣gistrates would not suffer him nor any of his men to come ashore, though he wanted necessaries for his voyage; but Thomas Lower, Arthur Cotton; John Light, and other friends went to the ship's side, and carried necessaries for the friends that were prisoners on board. The master, being thus crossed and vexed; cursed them that put him upon this freight; and said, <Q>He hoped he should not go far before he was taken.</Q> And the vessel was but a little while gone out of sight of Plymouth, before she was taken by a Dutch man of war, and carried into Holland. When they came into Holland, the States sent the banished friends back to England, with a letter of passport, and a certificate, <Q>That they had not made an escape, but were sent back by them.</Q> In time the Lord's power wrought over this storm, and ma∣ny of our persecutors were confounded and put to shame.</P>
<P>After I had lain prisoner above a year in Scarborough castle, I sent a letter to the king, in which I gave him <Q>an account of my imprisonment, and the bad usage I had re∣ceived in prison; and also that I was informed no man
<PB N="74" REF="037441_0590_100D91F1D42D2170"/>could deliver me but he.</Q> After this, John Whitehead being at London, and having acquaintance also with squire Marsh, he went to visit him, and spoke to him about me; and he undertook, if John Whitehead would get the state of my case drawn up, to deliver it to the master of requests, Sir John Birkenhead, who would endeavour to get a release for me. So John Whitehead and Ellis Hookes drew up a relation of my imprisonment and sufferings, and carried it to Marsh; and he went with it to the master of requests, who procured an order from the king for my release. The sub∣stance of the order was, <Q>That the king being certainly in∣formed that I was a man principled against plotting and fighting, and had been ready at all times to discover plots, rather than to make any, &amp;c. therefore his royal pleasure was, that I should be discharged from my imprisonment,</Q> &amp;c. As soon as this order was obtained, John Whitehead came to Scarborough with it, and delivered it to the go∣vernor; who, upon receipt thereof, gathered the officers together, and, without requiring bond or sureties for my peaceable living, being satisfied that I was a man of a peace∣able life, he discharged me freely, and gave me the follow∣ing passport:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>PERMIT the bearer hereof, George Fox, late a prison∣er here, and now discharged by his majesty's order, quietly to pass about his lawful occasions, without any molestation.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>Given under my hand at Scarborough castle, <DATE>this first day of September, 1666.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>JORDAN CROSLANDS, Governor of Scarborough castle.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>After I was released, I would have made the governor a present for the civility and kindness he had of late shewed me; but he would not receive any thing; saying, <Q>What∣ever good he could do for me and my friends, he would do it, and never do them any hurt.</Q> And afterwards, if at any time the mayor of the town sent to him for soldiers to break up friends meetings, if he sent any down, he would pri∣vately give them a charge, 'Not to meddle.' He continu∣ed loving to his dying-day. The officers also and the sol∣diers were mightily changed, and become very respectful to me. When they had occasion to speak of me, they would
<PB N="75" REF="037441_0591_100D91F365EDA3F8"/>say, <Q>He is as stiff as a tree, and as pure as a bell; for we could never bow him.</Q></P>
<P>The very next day after my release, the fire broke out in London; and the report of it came quickly down into the country. Then I saw the Lord God was true and just in his word, which he had shewed me before in Lancaster gaol, when I saw the angel of the Lord with a glittering drawn sword southward, as before expressed. The people of Lon∣don were forewarned of this fire: yet few laid it to heart, or believed it; but rather grew more wicked, and higher in pride. A friend was moved to come out of Huntingdon∣shire a little before the sire, and to scatter his money up and down the streets, turn his horse loose, untie the knees of his breeches, and let his stockings fall down, and to unbutton his doublet, and tell the people, 'So should they run up and down, scattering their money and goods, half undressed, like 'mad people, as he was a sign to them;' which they did when the city was burning. Thus hath the Lord exercised his prophets and servants by his power, shewed them signs of his judgments, and sent them to forewarn the people; but instead of repenting, they have beaten and cruelly entreat∣ed some; and some they have imprisoned, both in the for∣mer power's days, and since. But the Lord is just; and happy are they that obey his word. Some have been mov∣ed to go naked in their streets, in the other power's days, and since, as signs of their nakedness; and have declared amongst them, <Q>That God would strip them of their hypo∣critical professions, and make them as bare and naked as they were.</Q> But, instead of considering it, they have fre∣quently whipped, or otherwise abused them, and some∣times imprisoned them. Others have been moved to go in sackcloth, and to denounce the woes and vengeance of God against the pride and haughtiness of the people; but few regarded it. And in the other power's days, the wick∣ed, envious, professing priests put up several petitions both to Oliver and Richard, called protectors, and to the parlia∣ments, judges, and justices against us, stuffed full of lies, and vilifying words and slanders; but we got copies of them, and through the Lord's assistance answered the all, and cleared the Lord's truth and ourselves of them. But oh! the body of darkness that rose against the truth, in them that made lies their refuge! But the Lord swept them away; and in and with his power, truth, light, and life hedged his lambs about, and preserved them as on eagles'
<PB N="76" REF="037441_0592_100D91F4F8702E60"/>wings. Therefore we all had and have great encourage∣ment to trust the Lord, who, we saw, by his power and Spirit, overturned and brought to nought all the confedera∣cies and counsels that were hatched in darkness against his trath and people; and by the same truth gave his people dominion, that therein they might serve him.</P>
<P>Indeed, I could not but take notice how the hand of the Lord turned against those my persecutors who had been the cause of my imprisonment, or had been abusive or cruel to me under it. For the officer that fetched me to Houlker∣hall wasted his estate, and soon after fled into Ireland. And most of the justices that were upon the bench at the sessions when I was sent to prison died in awhile after; as old Tho∣mas Presten, Rawlinson, Porter, and Matthew West of Borwick. And justice Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherless children; who had impri∣soned two friends to death, and thereby made several chil∣dren fatherless. Colonel Kirby never prospered after. The chief constable, Richard Dodgson, died soon after; and Mount, the petty constable, and the wife of John Ashbum∣ham the other petty constable, who railed at me in her house, died soon after. William Knipe, the witness they brought against me, died soon after. Hunter, the gaoler of Lancaster, who was very wicked to me while I was his prisoner, was cut off in his young days. The under she∣riff, that carried me from Lancaster prison towards Scarbo∣rough, lived not long after. And Joblin, the gaoler of Durham, who was prisoner with me in Scarborough castle, and had often incensed the governor and soldiers against me, though he got out of prison, the Lord cut him off in his wickedness soon after. When I came into that country again, most of those that dwelt in Lancashire were dead, and others ruined in their estates: so that, though I did not seek revenge upon them, for their actings against me contrary to the law, yet the Lord had executed his judg∣ments upon many of them.</P>
<P>Being now at liberty, I went about three miles to a large general meeting at a friend's house, who had been a chief constable; and all was quiet and well. On fourth-day af∣ter I returned to Scarborough, and had a meeting in the town at Peter Hodgson's. To this meeting came one call∣ed a lady, and several other great persons; also a young man, son to the bailiff of the town, who had been convinc∣ed while I was there in prison. That lady (so called) came
<PB N="77" REF="037441_0593_100D91F7A736F890"/>to me, and said, 'I spoke against the ministers.' I told her, <Q>Such as the prophets and Christ declared against for∣merly, I declared against now.</Q></P>
<P>From hence I went to Whitby: and, having visited friends there, passed to Burlington, where I had another meeting. From thence to Oram, where I had another meeting; and thence to Marmaduke Storr's, and had a large meeting at a constable's house, on whom the Lord had wrought a great miracle.</P>
<P>Next day two friends being to take each other in marri∣age, there was a very great meeting, which I attended. I was moved to open the state of our marriages, declaring, <Q>How the people of God took one another in the assemblies of the elders; and that it was God who joined man and woman together before the fall. And though men had tak∣en upon them to join in the fall, yet in the restoration it is God's joining that is the right and honourable marriage; but never any priest did marry any, that we read of in the scriptures, from Genesis to Revelations.</Q> Then I shewed them the duty of man and wife, how they should serve God, being heirs of life and grace together.</P>
<P>I passed from thence to Grace Barwick's, where I had a general meeting, which was very large. I came next to Richard Shipton's, where I had another meeting; and to a priest's house, whose wife was convinced, and himself grown very loving, and glad to see me. This was that priest, who, in the year 1651, threatened, <Q>If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I should have his;</Q> and said, <Q>He would lose his head if I were not knocked down in a month;</Q> but now he was partly convinced, and become very kind. I went from his house towards the sea, where several friends came to visit me: amongst others, Philip Scarff, who had formerly been a priest, but, having receiv∣ed the truth, was now become a preacher of Christ freely, and continued so. Passing on, I called to see an ancient man, who was convinced of truth, and was above an hun∣dred years old. Then I came to a friend's house, where I had a great meeting, and quiet. I had a great meeting near Malton; and another large one near Hull: from whence I went to Holdendike. As we went into the town, the watch∣men questioned me and those that were with me; but they not having any warrant to stay us, we passed by them, and they in a rage threatened they would search us out. I went to the house of one called the lady Montague, where I lodg∣ed
<PB N="78" REF="037441_0594_100D91F9A1A63648"/>that night; and several friends came to visit me. Next morning, being up betimes, I walked into the orchard, and saw a man about sun-rising go into the house in a great cloak. He staid not long; but soon came out again, and went away, not seeing me. I felt something strike at my life; and went into the house, where I found the maid-ser∣vant affrighted and trembling. She told me, <Q>That man had a naked rapier under his cloak.</Q> By which I perceiv∣ed he came with an intent to have done mischief; but the Lord prevented him.</P>
<P>I then visited friends till I came to York, where we had a large meeting. After which I went to visit justice Robin∣son, an ancient justice of peace; who had been very loving to me and friends from the beginning. There was a priest with him; who told me, <Q>It was said, that we loved none but ourselves.</Q> I told him, <Q>We loved all mankind as they were God's creation, and as they were children of Adam and Eve by generation; and we loved the brother∣hood in the Holy Ghost.</Q> This stopped him. After some other discourse, we parted friendly, and passed away.</P>
<P>About this time I wrote a book, intituled, <Q>Fear God, and honour the king;</Q> in which I shewed, <Q>That none could rightly fear God, and honour the king, but they that departed from sin and evil:</Q> This book did much affect the soldiers and most people.</P>
<P>Having visited friends at York, we passed to a market town, where we had a meeting at George Watkinson's, who formerly had been a justice. A glorious, blessed meeting it was, very large, and the seed of life was set over all. But we had been troubled to get into this town, had not Pro∣vidence made way for us; for the watchmen stood ready to stop us: but there being a man riding just before us, the watchmen questioned him first; and perceiving he was a justice, let him pass; and we riding close after him, by that means escaped.</P>
<P>From this place we passed to Thomas Taylor's, who had formerly been a captain, where we had a precious meeting. Hard by Thomas Taylor's lived a knight, who was much displeased when he heard I was like to be released out of prison; and threatened, <Q>if the king set me at liberty, he would send me to prison again the next day.</Q> But though I had this meeting so near him, the Lord's power stopped him from meddling, and our meeting was quiet. Colonel Kirby also, who had been the chief means of my imprison∣ment
<PB N="79" REF="037441_0595_100D91FB329D9C70"/>at Lancaster and Scarborough castles, when he heard I was set at liberty, got another order for the taking me up; and said, <Q>He would ride his horse forty miles to take me, and would give forty pounds to have me taken.</Q> Awhile after I came so near as to have a meeting within two miles of him: and then he was struck with the gout, and kept his bed, so that it was thought he would have died.</P>
<P>From Thomas Taylor's I visited friends till I came to Synderhill-Green, where I had a large and general meeting. The priest of the place, hearing of it, sent the constable to the justices for a warrant; and they rode their horses so hard, they almost spoiled them: but the notice they had being short, and the way long, the meeting was ended before they came. I heard not of them till I was going out of the house, after meeting was over; and then a friend came and told me, <Q>They were searching another house for me, the house I was then going to.</Q> As I went along the closes towards it, I met the constables, wardens, and the justice's clerk. I passed through them, they looking at me, and went to the house they had been searching. Thus they lost their design; for the Lord's power bound them, and preserved me over them; and friends parted, and all escaped them. The officers went away as they came; for the Lord had frustrated their design; praised be his name for ever!</P>
<P>After this I went into Derbyshire, where I had a large meeting. Some friends were apprehensive of the constable's coming; for they had great persecution in those parts: but our meeting was quiet. A justice of peace in that county had taken away much of friends goods: whereupon Ellen Fretwell had made her appeal to the sessions, and the rest of the justices granted her her goods again, and spoke to that persecuting justice, that he should not do so any more. She was moved to speak to that justice, and to warn him: whereupon he bid her, 'Come and sit down on the bench.' 'Ay,' said she, <Q>if I may persuade you to do justice to the country, I will sit down with you.</Q> 'No,' said he, <Q>then you shall not. Get out of the court.</Q> As she was going. she was moved of the Lord to turn again, and say, <Q>She should be there when he should not.</Q> After the sessions, he went home and drove away her brother's oxen, for going to meetings. Then Susan Frith, a friend of Chesterfield was moved of the Lord to tell him, <Q>If he continued in his persecuting of the innocent, the Lord would execute his
<PB N="80" REF="037441_0596_100D91FCDE85F318"/>plagues upon him.</Q> Soon after which he fell distracted, and died. This relation I had from Ellen Fretwell herself.</P>
<P>I travelled out of Derbyshire into Nottinghamshire, and had a large meeting at Skegby; from thence went to Mans∣field, where also I had a meeting; and thence to another town, where was a fair, at which I met with many friends. Then passing through the forest in a mighty thundering and rainy day, I came to Nottingham. So great was the tem∣pest, that many trees were torn up by the roots, and some people killed; but the Lord preserved us. On first-day following I had a large meeting in Nottingham, very quiet; friends were come to sit under their teacher the grace of God, which brought them salvation, and were established upon the rock and foundation Christ Jesus. After meeting I went to visit the friend who had been sheriff about the year 1649, whose prisoner I then was.</P>
<P>From Nottingham I passed into Leicestershire, and came to Syleby, where we had a large blessed meeting. After which I went to Leicester to visit the prisoners there, and then to John Penford's, where we had a general meeting, large and precious. From thence I passed, visiting friends and my relations, till I came to Warwick; where having visited the prisoners, I passed to Badgley, and had a pre∣cious meeting. I travelled through Northamptonshire, Bed∣fordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, visiting friends in each county. In Oxfordshire the devil had laid a snare for me, but the Lord broke it; his power came over all, his blessed truth spread, and friends were increased therein. Thus after I had passed through many counties, visiting friends, and had many large and precious meetings amongst them, I came to London. But I was so weak with lying almost three years in cruel and hard imprisonments, my joints and my body were so stiff and benumbed, that I could hardly get upon my horse, nor bend my joints, nor well bear to be near the fire, or to eat warm meat, I had been kept so long from it. Being come to London, I walk∣ed a little among the ruins, and took good notice of them I saw the city lying, according as the word of the Lord came to me concerning it several years before.</P>
<P>After I had been a time in London, and visited meetings through the city, I went into the country again, and had large meetings as I went, at Kingston, Reading, and in Wiltshire, till I came, to Bristol; where also I had many large meetings. Thomas Lower came out of Cornwall to
<PB N="81" REF="037441_0597_100D91FEF2C0EB80"/>meet me, and friends from several parts of the nation, it be∣ing then the fair-time. After I was clear of Bristol, I went to Nath. Crips's, and through the country to London again, having large meetings in the way, and all quiet, blessed be the Lord. Thus, though I was very weak, I travelled up and down in the service of the Lord, who enabled me to go through in it.</P>
<P>About this time, some who had run out from truth and clashed against friends, were reached unto by the power of the Lord, which came wonderfully over, and made them 'condemn and tear their papers of controversy to pieces.' Several meetings we had with them, the Lord's everlasting power was over all, and set judgment on the head of that which had run out. In these meetings, which lasted whole days, several who had gone out with John Perrot and others came in again, and condemned that spirit which led them to <Q>keep on their hats when friends prayed, and when themselves prayed.</Q> Some of them said, <Q>Friends were more righteous than they;</Q> and that, <Q>If friends had not stood they had been gone and had fallen into perdition.</Q> Thus the Lord's power was wonderfully manifested, and came over all.</P>
<P>Then I was moved of the Lord to recommend the setting up of five monthly meetings of men and women in the city of London, besides the women's meetings and the quarterly meetings, to take care of God's glory, and to admonish and exhort such as walked disorderly or carelessly, and not ac∣cording to truth. For whereas friends had only quarterly meetings, now truth was spread and friends grown more numerous, I was moved to recommend the setting up of monthly meetings throughout the nation. And the Lord opened to me what I must do, and how the men's and women's monthly and quarterly meetings should be ordered and established in this and other nations; and that I should write to those where I came not, to do the same. After things were well settled at London, and the Lord's truth, power, seed, and life reigned and shined over all in the city, I went into Essex. After the monthly meetings were settled in that county, I went into Suffolk and Norfolk, Thomas, Dry being with me. When we had visited friends in those parts, and the monthly meetings were settled, we went into Huntingdonshire, where we had very large and blessed meetings; and though we met with some opposition, the Lord's power came over all, and the monthly meetings
<PB N="82" REF="037441_0598_100D9201C6C9F9E0"/>were established there also. When we came into Bedford∣shire, we had great opposition; but the Lord's power came over it all. Afterwards we went into Nottinghamshire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were settled there. Then passing into Lincoln∣shire, we had a meeting of some men friends of all the meet∣ings in the county, at his house who had been formerly sheriff of Lincoln; and all was quiet. After this meeting we passed over Trent into Nottinghamshire, he that had been the sheriff of Lincoln being with me, where we had some of all the meetings in that county together. Our meeting was glorious and peaceable, and many precious meetings we had in that county.</P>
<P>At that time William Smith was very weak and sick, and the constables and others had seized all his goods, to the very bed he lay upon, for truth's sake. These officers threatened to break up our meeting; but the Lord's power chained them, so that they had not power to meddle with us, blessed be his name. After the meeting I went to visit William Smith, and there were constables and others watch∣ing his corn and his beasts, that none of them might be re∣moved.</P>
<P>From thence we passed into Leicestershire and Warwick-shire, where we had many blessed meetings. The order of the gospel was set up, and the men's monthly meetings established in all those counties. Then we went into Der∣byshire, where we had several large and blessed meetings. In many places we were threatened by the officers, but through the power of the Lord we escaped their hands. Leaving things well settled in Derbyshire, we travelled over the Peak-hills (which were very cold, for it was then frost and snow) and came into Staffordshire. At Thomas Ham∣mersley's we had a general men's meeting; where things were well settled in the gospel order, and the monthly meetings established. I was so exceeding weak, I was hardly able to get on or off my horse's back; but my spirit being earnestly engaged in the work the Lord had concerned me in and sent me forth about, I travelled on therein, not∣withstanding the weakness of my body, having confidence in the Lord, that he would carry me through, as he did by his power. We came into Cheshire, where we had several blessed meetings, and a general men's meeting; wherein all the monthly meetings for that county were settled, accord∣ing to the gospel order, in and by the power of God. Af∣ter
<PB N="83" REF="037441_0599_100D9203563132B8"/>the meeting I passed away. But when the justices heard of it, they were very much troubled that they had not come and broke it up, and taken me; but the Lord prevented them. After I had cleared myself there in the Lord's ser∣vice, I passed into Lancashire, to William Barnes's, near Warrington, where met some of most of the meetings in that county; and there all the monthly meetings were esta∣blished in the gospel order. From thence I sent papers into Westmoreland by Leonard Fell and Robert Widders, and also into Bishoprick, Cleveland, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Scotland, to exhort friends to settle the monthly meetings in the Lord's power in those places; which they did. So the Lord's power came over all, and the heirs of it came to inherit it. For the authority of our meetings is the power of God, the gospel, which brings life and immortality to light; that all might see over the devil that darkened them, that all the heirs of the gospel might walk according to the gospel, and glorify God with their bodies, souls, and spirits, which are the Lord's: for the or∣der of the glorious gospel is not of man nor by man. To this meeting in Lancashire, Margaret Fell, being a prisoner, got liberty to come, and went with me from thence to Jane Milner's in Cheshire, where we parted. I passed into Shropshire, and from thence into Wales, and had a large general men's meeting at Charles Lloyd's, where some op∣posers came in; but the Lord's power brought them down.</P>
<P>Having gone through Denbighshire and Montgomery∣shire, we passed into Merionethshiro, where we had several blessed meetings; and then to the sea-side, where we had a precious meeting. We left Wales, the monthly meetings being settled there in the power of God, and re∣turned into Shropshire, where the friends of the county ga∣thering together, the monthly meetings were established there. Coming into Worcestershire, after many meetings amongst friends in that county, we had a general men's meeting at Henry Gibs's, at Pashur; where also the month∣ly meetings were settled in the gospel order.</P>
<P>The sessions being held that day in the town, some friends were concerned lest they should send officers to break up our meeting; but the power of the Lord restrained them, so that it was quiet; through which power we had domi∣nion. I had several meetings amongst friends in that cour∣ty, till I came to Worcester; and it being the fair-time, we had a precious meeting. There was then in Worcester
<PB N="84" REF="037441_0600_100D9205489576C8"/>one major Wild, a persecuting man; and after I was gone some of his soldiers inquired after me; but having left the friends there settled in good order, we passed to Droitwich, and from thence to Shrewsbury, where also we had a very precious meeting. The mayor, hearing I was in town, got the rest of the officers together to consult what to do against me; for they said, <Q>The great Quaker of England is come to town.</Q> But when they were come together, the Lord confounded their councils, so that some were for imprison∣ing me, others opposed it; and being divided amongst themselves, I escaped their hands.</P>
<P>We went into Radnorshire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were settled in the Lord's power. As we came out of that county, staying a little at a market-town, a justice's clerk and other rude fel∣lows combined together to do us a mischief upon the road. Accordingly they followed as out of town, and soon over∣took us; but there being many market people on the way, they were somewhat hindered from doing what they intend∣ed. Yet observing two of our company ride at some dis∣tance behind, they set upon them two, and one of them drew his sword, and cut Richard Moor, the surgeon of Shrewsbury. Meanwhile another of these rude fellows came galloping after me and the other friend with me; and we being to pass over a bridge, somewhat of the narrowest for him to pass by us, he, in his eagerness to get before us, rode into the brook, and plunged his horse into a deep hole in the water. I saw the design, stopped, and desired friends to be patient, and give them no occasion. In this time came Richard Moor up to us, with the other friend, who knew the men and their names. Then we rode on, and a little further met another man on foot, much in liquor, with a naked sword in his hand, and not far beyond him two men and two women, one of which men had his thumb cut off by the drunken man; for being in drink he attempted rude∣ness to one of the women, and this man withstanding him, and rescuing her, he whipped out his sword and cut off his thumb. This mischievous man had a horse, that, being loose, followed him a pretty way behind. I rode after the horse, caught him, and brought him to the man who had his thumb cut off; and bid him take the horse to the next justice of peace, by which means they might find out and pursue the man that had wounded him.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion I wrote a letter to the justices, and
<PB N="85" REF="037441_0601_100D92075E70B980"/>the judge of assize, which was then at hand. I employed some friends to carry it to the justices first. The justice, to whom the clerk belonged, rebuked him and the others also, for abusing us upon the highway; so that they were glad to come and intreat friends not to appear against them at the assize; which, upon their submission and acknow∣ledgment, was granted. This was of good service in the country; for it stopped many rude people, who had been forward to abuse friends.</P>
<P>We passed into Herefordshire, where we had several bles∣sed meetings. We had a general men's meeting also, where all the monthly meetings were settled. There was about this time a proclamation against meetings; and as we came through Herefordshire, we were told of a great meet∣ing there of the Presbyterians, who had engaged themselves to stand, and give up all, rather than forsake their meetings. When they heard of this proclamation, the people came, but the priest was gone, and left them at a loss. Then they met in Leominster privately, and provided bread, cheese, and drink, in readiness, that if the officers should come, they might put up their bibles and fall to eating. The bailiff found them out, came in among them, and said, <Q>Their bread and cheese should not cover them, he would have their speakers.</Q> They cried, <Q>What then would become of their wives and children?</Q> But he took their speakers and kept them awhile. This the bailiff told Peter Young, and said, <Q>They were the veriest hypocrites that ever made a profession of religion.</Q></P>
<P>The like contrivance they had in other places. For there was one Pocock at London, that married Abigail Darcy, who was called a lady; and she being convinced of truth, I went to his house to see her. This Pocock had been one of the triers of the priests; and, being an high Presbyterian, and envious against us, he used to call our friends house-creepers. He being present, she said to me, <Q>I have some∣thing to speak to thee against my husband.</Q> 'Nay,' said I, 'thou must not speak against thy husband.' 'Yes,' said <Q>she, but I must in this case. The last first-day,</Q> said she, <Q>he, his priests and people, the Presbyterians, met; they had candles, tobacco-pipes, bread, cheese, and cold meat on the table; and they agreed beforehand, if the officers should come in upon them, they would leave their preach∣ing and praying, and fall to their cold meat.</Q> 'Oh,' said <Q>I to him, is not this a shame to you who imprisoned us,
<PB N="86" REF="037441_0602_100D920964843C70"/>and spoiled our goods, because we would not join you in your religion, and called us house-creepers, that ye do not stand to your own religion yourselves? Did ye ever find our meetings stuffed with bread and cheese and tobacco∣pipes? Or did ye ever read in the scriptures of any such practice among the saints?</Q> 'Why,' said the old man, 'we must be as wise as serpents.' I answered, <Q>This is the serpent's wisdom indeed. But who would have thought that you Presbyterians and Independents, who persecuted, imprisoned others, spoiled their goods, and whipped such as would not follow your religion, should now flinch yourselves, and not dare to stand to your own religion, but cover it with tobacco-pipes, flagons of drink, cold meat, and bread and cheese!</Q> But this, and such-like de∣ceitful practices, I understood afterwards, were too common amongst them in times of persecution.</P>
<P>After we had travelled through Herefordshire, and meet∣ings were well settled there, we passed into Monmouthshire, where I had several blessed meetings; and at Walter Jen∣kins's, who had been a justice of peace, we had a large meeting, where some were convinced: this meeting was qui∣et. But to a meeting before this came the bailiff of the hundred, almost drunk, pretending he was to take up the speakers. There was a mighty power of God in the meet∣ing; so that, although he raged, it limited him, that he could not break up the meeting. When it was over, I staid awhile, and he staid also. After some time I spoke to him, and so passed quietly away. At night some rude people came, and shot off a musket against the house; but did not hurt any body. Thus the Lord's power came over all, and chained down the unruly spirits, so that we escaped them. We came to Ross that night, and had a meeting at James Merrick's.</P>
<P>After this we came into Gloucestershire, and had a gene∣ral men's meeting at Nathaniel Crips's, where all the month∣ly meetings were settled in the Lord's everlasting power; and the heirs of salvation were exhorted to take their pos∣sessions in the gospel, the power of God, which was and is the authority of their meetings. Many blessed meetings we had in that county, before we came to Bristol. And after several powerful seasons, the men's and women's meetings were settled there also.</P>
<P>As I was in bed at Bristol, the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go back to London. Next morning
<PB N="87" REF="037441_0603_100D920B5A943AD0"/>Alexander Parker and several others came to me. I asked them, What they felt? They asked me, What was upon me? I told them, I felt I must return to London. They said, the same was upon them. So we gave up to return to London; for which way the Lord moved and led us, thither we went in his power. Leaving Bristol, we passed into Wiltshire, and established the men's monthly meetings in the Lord's power there; and visited friends till we came to London.</P>
<P>After we had visited friends in the city I was moved to exhort them to bring all their marriages to the men's and women's meetings, that they might lay them before the faithful; that care might be taken to prevent such disorders as had been committed by some. For many had gone to∣gether in marriage contrary to their relations minds; and some young, raw people, that came among us, had mixed with the world. Widows had married without making provision for their children by their former husbands, be∣fore their second marriage. Yet I had given forth a paper concerning marriages about the year 1653, when truth was but little spread, advising friends, who might be concerned in that case, <Q>That they might lay it before the faithful in time, before any thing was concluded; and afterwards pub∣lish it in the end of a meeting, or in a market, as they were moved thereto. And when all things were found clear, being free from all others, and their relations satis∣fied, they might appoint a meeting on purpose, for the taking of each other; in the presence of at least twelve faithful witnesses.</Q> Yet these directions not being observ∣ed, and truth being now more spread over the nation, it was ordered by the same power and Spirit of God, <Q>That marriages should be laid before the men's monthly and quarterly meetings, or as the meetings were then establish∣ed; that friends might see, that the relations of those who proceeded to marriage were satisfied; that the parties were clear from all others; and that widows had made provision for their first husband's children, before they married again; and what else was needful to be inquired into; that all things might be kept clean and pure, and be done in righte∣ousness to the glory of God.</Q> Afterwards it was ordered in the wisdom of God, <Q>That if either of the parties intending to marry came out of another nation, county, or monthly meeting, they should bring a certificate from the monthly meeting to which they belonged; for the satisfaction of the
<PB N="88" REF="037441_0604_100D920CEBA04A08"/>monthly meeting before which they came to lay their in∣tentions of marriage.</Q></P>
<P>After these things, with many other services for God, were set in order, and settled in the city, I passed out of London, in the leadings of the Lord's power, into Hert∣fordshire. After I had visited friends there, and the men's monthly meetings were settled, I had a great meeting at Baldock of many sorts of people. Then returning towards London by Waltham, I advised the setting up of a school there for teaching boys; and also a women's school to be opened at Shacklewell for instructing girls and young maid∣ens, in whatsoever things were civil and useful in the crea∣tion.</P>
<P>Thus, after several precious meetings in the country, I came to London again, where I staid awhile in the work and service of the Lord; and then went into Buckingham∣shire, where I had many precious meetings. At John Brown's of Weston near Aylesbury some of the men friends of each meeting being gathered together, the men's monthly meetings for that county were established, in the order of the gospel, the power of God; which confirmed it in all that felt it, who came thereby to see and feel-that the power of God was the authority of their meetings. I then went to Nathaniel Ball's, at North Newton near Banbury, Oxford∣shire, who was a friend in the ministry. And there being a general meeting, where some of all the meetings were pre∣sent, the monthly meetings for that county were settled in the power of God; and friends were very glad of them; for they came into their services in the church, to take care for God's glory. After this, we came into Gloucestershire, vi∣siting friends till we came into Monmouthshire, to Richard Hambery's; where meeting with some of all the meetings of that county, the monthly meetings were settled there in the Lord's power, that all in it might take care of God's glory, and admonish and exhort such as did not walk as be∣came the gospel. And indeed these meetings made a great reformation amongst people, insomuch that the justices took notice of their usefulness.</P>
<P>Richard Hambery and his wife accompanied us a day's journey, visiting friends, till we came to a widow's, where we lay that night. From thence we passed over the hills, visiting friends, and declaring the truth to people, till we came to another widow's, where we had a meeting. The
<PB N="89" REF="037441_0605_100D920FAE4421A8"/>woman could not speak English; yet she praised the Lord for sending us to visit them.</P>
<P>We travelled till we came to Swansey, where on the first-day we had a large and precious meeting, the Lord's pre∣sence being eminently amongst us. On a week day after∣wards we had a general meeting beyond Swansey, of men friends from Swansey, Tenby, Haverfordwest, and other places; and the monthly meetings were settled in the gospel order, and received by friends in the power of the Lord; whose truth was over all.</P>
<P>From hence we endeavoured to get over the water into Cornwall: and in order thereunto went back through Swansey to Mumbles, thinking to have got passage there; but the master deceived us; for though he had promised to carry us, when we came he would not. We went to ano∣ther place, where was a passage-boat, into which we got our horses; but some rude men in the boat (though called gen∣tlemen) threatened to pistol the master if he took us in; who, being afraid of them, turned our horses out again; which put us out of hopes of getting over that way. Where∣fore turning back into the country, we staid up all night; and about the second hour in the morning took horse, and travelled till we came near Cardiff, where we staid one night. The next day we came to Newport, and it being market-day there, several friends came to us, with whom we sat awhile; and after a fine refreshing season together, we part∣ed from them, and went forward.</P>
<P>Beyond this market-town we overtook a man who linger∣ed on the way, as if he staid for somebody; but when we came up to him, he rode along with us, and asked us many questions. At length meeting with two, who seemed to be pages to some great persons, he took acquaintance with them; and I heard him tell them he would stop us, and take us up. We rode on; and when he came to us, and would have stopped us, I told him. <Q>None ought to stop us on the king's highway, for it was as free for us as for them;</Q> and I was moved to exhort him to fear the Lord. Then he galloped away before us; and I perceived his in∣tent was to stop us at Shipton in Wales, a garrison-town, through which we were to pass. When we were come to Shipton. John-ap-John being with me, we walked down the hill into the town, leading our horses. It being mar∣ket-day there, several friends met us, and would have had us to an inn. But we were not to go into any inn, so we
<PB N="90" REF="037441_0606_100D92119B9F0F68"/>walked directly through the town over the bridge, and then were out of the limits of that town. Thus the Lord's ever∣lasting arm and power preserved us, and carried us over in his work and service.</P>
<P>The next first-day we had a large meeting in the Forest of Dean; and all was quiet. Next day we passed over the water to Oldstone; where after we had visited friends, we came again to William Yeomans's, at Jubb's Court in So∣mersetshire. From thence we went to a meeting at Posset, whither several friends of Bristol came to us. After which we went further into the country, and had several large meetings. The Lord's living presence was with us, sup∣porting and refreshing us in our labour and travel in his service.</P>
<P>We came to a place near Minehead, where we had a ge∣neral meeting of the men friends in Somersetshire. There came also a cheat, whom some friendly people would have had me to have taken along with me. I saw he was a cheat; therefore bid them bring him to me, and see whether he would look me in the face. Some were ready to think I was too hard towards him, because I would not let him go along with me; but when they brought him to me, he was not able to look me in the face, but looked hither and thi∣ther; for he was indeed a cheat, and had cheated a priest, by pretending himself to be a minister, he had got a priest's suit, and went away with it.</P>
<P>After the meeting we passed to Minehead, where we tarri∣ed that night. In the night I had an exercise upon me, from a sense I had of a dark spirit working and striving to get up to disturb the church of Christ. Next morning I was moved to write a few lines to friends, as a warning thereof, as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIVE in the power of the Lord God, in his Seed that is set over all, and is over all trials that you may have from the dark spirit, which would be owned in its actings, and thrust itself amongst you; which is not come as yet: but in the power of the Lord God, and his Seed, keep over it, and bring it to condemnation. For I felt a kind of dark spirit thrusting itself up towards you, and heaving up last night; but you may keep it down with the power of God; that the witness may arise to condemn its actings, so far as it hath spread its dark works, before it
<PB N="91" REF="037441_0607_100D921329B91F30"/>have any admittance. So no more, but my love in the Seed of God, which changeth not.</P>

<DATELINE>Minehead in Somersetshire, <DATE>the22d of the 4th month, 1668.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The next day several friends of Minehead accompanied us as far as Barnstable and Appledon in Devonshire, where we had a meeting. Barnstable had been a bloody persecut∣ing town. There were two men friends of that town, who had been a great while at sea; and coming home to visit their relations (one of them having a wife and children) the mayor of the town sent for them, under pretence of dis∣course with them; and put the oaths of allegiance and supre∣macy to them. Because they could not swear, he sent them to Exeter gaol, where judge Archer premunired them, and kept them till one of them died in prison. When I heard of this, I was moved to write a letter to judge Archer, and another to that mayor of Barnstable, laying their wicked and unchristian actions upon their heads; and letting them know, that the <Q>blood of that man would be required at their hands.</Q></P>
<P>After a precious meeting at Appledon among some faith∣ful friends there, we passed to Stratton, and staid at an inn all night. Next day we rode to Humphrey Lower's, where we had a very precious meeting; the next day to Truro; so visit∣ing friends till we came to the Land's End. Then coming by the south part of that county, we visited friends till we came to Tregangeeves, where at Loveday Hambley's we had a general meeting for all the county; in which the monthly meetings were settled in the Lord's power, and in the blessed order of the gospel; that all who were faithful might admo∣nish and exhort such as walked not according to the gospel; that the house of God might be kept clean, righteousness might run down, and all unrighteousness be swept away. Several, who had run out, were brought to condemn what they had done amiss; and through repentance came in again.</P>
<P>Being clear of that county, we came into Devonshire, and had a meeting amongst friends at Plymouth. Whence passing to Richard Brown's, we came to the widow Phi∣lips's, where we had some men friends from all the meet∣ings together; and there the men's monthly meetings were fettled in the heavenly order of the gospel, the power of
<PB N="92" REF="037441_0608_100D7F8A0CB20000"/>God; which answered the witness of God in all. There was a great noise of a troop of horse coming to disturb our meeting; but the Lord's power prevented it, and preserved us in peace and safety.</P>
<P>After things were well settled, and the meeting done, we came to King's Bridge, and visited friends. Then (leaving friends in those parts well settled in the power of God) we passed to Topsham and Membury, visiting friends, and hav∣ing many meetings in the way, till we came to Ilchester in Somersetshire. Here we had a general men's meeting, and therein settled the men's monthly meetings for that county in the Lord's everlasting power, the order of the gospel. After the meetings were settled, and friends refreshed, com∣forted in the Lord's power, and established upon Christ, their rock and foundation, we passed to Puddimore; where, at William Beaton's, we had a blessed meeting, and all was quiet: though the constables had threatened before.</P>
<P>When we had visited most of the meetings in Somerset, shire, we passed into Dorsetshire to George Harris's, where we had a large men's meeting. There all the men's month∣ly meeting for that county were settled in the glorious or∣der of the gospel; that all in the power of God might <Q>seek that which was lost, bring again that which was driven away; cherish the good, and reprove the evil.</Q></P>
<P>Then we came to Southampton, where we had a large meeting on the first-day. From thence we went to Capt, Reeves's, where the general men's meeting for Hampshire was appointed; to which some from all parts of the county came, and a blessed meeting we had. The men's monthly meetings for that county were settled in the order of the gospel, which had brought life and immortality to light in them.</P>
<P>But there came a rude company of Ranters, who had opposed and disturbed our meetings much. One of the women had lain with a man, who had declared it at the Market-cross, and gloried in his wickedness. A company of these lewd people lived together, at a house hard by the place of our meeting. I went to the house, and told them of their wickedness. The man of the house asked, <Q>Why! did I make so strange of that?</Q> Another of them said, <Q>It was to stumble me.</Q> I told them, <Q>Their wickedness should not stumble me; for I was above it.</Q> I was mov∣ed of the Lord to tell them, <Q>The plagues and judgments of God would overtake them, and come upon them.</Q> Af∣terwards
<PB N="93" REF="037441_0609_100D9217F8C124F0"/>they went up and down the country, till at last they were cast into Winchester gaol; where the man that had lain with the woman stabbed the gaoler, but not mor∣tally. After they were let out of gaol, this fellow that stab∣bed the gaoler hanged himself. The woman also had like to have cut a child's throat, as we were informed. These people had formerly lived about London; and, when the city was fired, they prophesied, <Q>That all the rest of Lon∣don should be burnt within fourteen days,</Q> and hasted out of town. Though they were Ranters, great opposers of friends, and disturbers of our meetings, yet in the country, where they came, some would be apt to say they were Quakers. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to write a paper, to be dispersed amongst the magistrates and people of Hampshire, to clear friends and truth of them and their wicked actions.</P>
<P>After the men's monthly meetings in those parts were settled, and the Lord's blessed power was over all, we went to a town, where we had a meeting with friends. From thence we came to Farnham, where we me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many friends, it being the market-day. We had precious meetings up and down that country. Friends in those parts had for∣merly been plundered, and their goods much spoiled, on account of tithes, and for going to meetings; but the Lord's power at this time preserved both them and us from falling into the persecutors hands.</P>
<P>We had a general men's meeting at a friend's house in Surry; who had been plundered so extremely, that he had scarce a cow, horse, or swine left. The constables threaten∣ed to come and break up our meeting; but the Lord re∣strained them. At this meeting the men's monthly meet∣ings were settled in the authority of the heavenly power. After we had visited friends in that county, and had many large and precious meetings, we passed to a friend's house in Sussex, where the general meeting for the men friends of that county was appointed to be held; and thither came se∣veral from London to visit us. We had a blessed meeting; and the men's monthly meetings for that county were then settled in the Lord's eternal power, the gospel of salvation; that all in it might keep to the order of the gospel. There were at that time great threatenings of disturbance; but the meeting was quiet. We had several large meetings in that county; though friends were in great sufferings there, and many in prison. I was sent for to visit a friend that was
<PB N="94" REF="037441_0610_100D9219EA044190"/>sick, and went to see friends that were prisoners. There was danger of my being apprehended; but I went in the faith of God's power, and thereby the Lord preserved me in safety.</P>
<P>We passed into Kent; where, after we had been at seve∣ral meetings, we had a general one for the men friends of that county. There also the men's monthly meetings for that county were settled in the power of God, and esta∣blished in the order of the gospel, for all the heirs of it to enter into their services and care in the church for the glory of God. Friends rejoiced in the order of the gospel, and were glad of the settlement thereof.</P>
<P>After this I visited the meetings in Kent; and when I had cleared myself of the Lord's service in that county, I came to London. Thus were the men's monthly meetings settled through the nation; for I had been in Berkshire be∣fore, where most of the ancient friends of that county were in prison; and when I had informed them of the service of these monthly meetings, they were settled amongst them al∣so. The quarterly meetings were generally settled before. I wrote also into Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and several parts of America, advising friends to settle their men's monthly meetings in those countries. For they had their general quarterly meetings before; but now that truth was increased amongst them, they should settle monthly meetings in the power and Spirit of God which first con∣vinced them. Since these meetings have been settled, ma∣ny mouths have been opened in thanksgivings and praise, and many have blessed the Lord, that he sent me forth in this service; yea, with tears have many praised him. For all coming to have a concern and care for God's honour and glory, that his name be not blasphemed, which they pro∣fess; and to see that all who profess the truth, walk in the truth, in righteousness and holiness, which becomes the house of God, and that all order their conversation aright, that they may see the salvation of God; all having this care upon them for God's glory, and being exercised in his holy power and Spirit, in the order of the heavenly life and gos∣pel of Jesus, they may all see and know, possess and partake of the government of Christ, of the increase of which there is to be no end. Thus the Lord's everlasting renown and praise is set up in every one's heart that is faithful; so that we can say the gospel order established amongst us is not of man, nor by man, but of and by Jesus Christ, in and
<PB N="95" REF="037441_0611_100D921B8BB9D0D8"/>through the Holy Ghost. This order of the gospel, which is from Christ the heavenly man, is above all the orders of men in the fall, whether Jews, Gentiles, or apostatized Christians, and will remain when they are gone. For the power of God, which is the everlasting gospel, was before the devil was, and will be and remain for ever. And as the everlasting gospel was preached in the apostles days to all nations, that all might come into the order thereof, through the divine power, which brings life and immortality to light, that they who were heirs of it, might inherit the power and authority of it; so now, since all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and all the world hath worshipped the beast (but they, whose names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, who have worshipped God in spirit and truth, as Christ commanded) the everlasting gos∣pel is to be and is preached again, as John the divine fore∣saw it should, to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. This everlasting gospel torments the whore, and makes her and the beast to rage, even the beast that hath power over the tongues, which are called the original, to order them, by which they make divines, as they call them. But all that receive the gospel, the power of God, which brings life and immortality to light, come to see over the beast, devil, whore, and false prophet, that darkened them and all their worships and orders, and come to be heirs of the gospel, the power of God, which was before the beast, whore, false prophet, and devil were, and will be when they are all gone and cast into the lake of fire. And they that are heirs of this power and of this gospel inherit the power which is the authority of this order, and of our meet∣ings. These come to possess the joyful order of the joyful gospel, the comfortable order of the comfortable gospel, the glorious order of the glorious gospel, and the everlasting or∣der of the everlasting gospel, the power of God, which will last for ever, and will outlast all the orders of the devil, and that which is of men or by men. These shall see the government of Christ, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; and of the increase of his glorious, righteous, holy, just government there is no end; but his government and his order will remain: for he who is the au∣thor of it is the first and the last, the beginning and ending the foundation of God, which over all stands sure; Christ Jesus, the Amen.</P>
<P>Being returned to London, I slaid some time, visiting
<PB N="96" REF="037441_0612_100D921D1FE924C8"/>friends meetings in and about the city. While I was in London, I went one day to visit squire Marsh, who had shewed much kindness both to me and friends. I happen∣ed to go when he was at dinner. He no sooner heard of my name, but he sent for me up, and would have had me sit down with him to dinner; but I had not freedom to do so. Several great persons were at dinner with him; and he said to one of them who was a great Papist, <Q>Here is a Quaker, which you have not seen before.</Q> The Papist asked me, 'Whether I did own the christening of children?' I told him, 'There was no scripture for any such practice.' 'What!' said he, 'not for christening children!' I said, 'Nay.' I told him, <Q>The one baptism by the one spirit into one body we owned; but to throw a little water on a child's face, and say, that was baptizing and christening it, there was no scripture for that.</Q> He asked me, <Q>Whe∣ther I did own the Catholic faith?</Q> I said, 'Yes;' but added, <Q>That neither the pope nor the papists were in the Catholic faith; for the true faith works by love, and puri∣fies the heart; and if they were in that faith that gives victory, by which they might have access to God, they would not tell the people of a purgatory after they were dead. So I undertook to prove, <Q>That neither pope nor papists, that held a purgatory hereafter, were in the true faith.</Q> For the true, precious, divine faith, which Christ is the author of, gives victory over the devil and sin, that separated man and woman from God. And if they (the Papists) were in the true faith, they would never use racks, prisons, and fines to persecute and force others to their religion, that were not of their faith. This was not the practice of the apostles and primitive Christians, who wit∣nessed and enjoyed the true faith of Christ; but it was the practice of the faithless Jews and heathens so to do. But,</Q> said I, <Q>seeing thou art a great leading man among the Papists, and hast been taught and bred up under the pope,</Q> and seeing thou sayest, <Q>There is no salvation but in your church;</Q> I desire to know of thee, <Q>What it is that doth bring salvation in your church?</Q> He answer∣ed, "A good life." 'And nothing else?' said I. 'Yes,' said he, 'good works!' <Q>Is this it that brings salvation in your church, a good life and good works? Is this your doctrine and principle?</Q> said I. 'Yes,' said he. <Q>Then, said I, neither thou, nor the pope, nor any of the Papists know what it is that brings salvation.</Q> He asked me,
<PB N="97" REF="037441_0613_100D921FF3F6EEC8"/>'What brought salvation in our church?' I told him, That which brought salvation to the church in the apos∣tles days, the same brought salvation to us, and not ano∣ther; namely, "The grace of God, which," the scripture says, "brings salvation, and hath appeared to all men," which taught the saints then, and teaches us now. This grace, which brings salvation, teaches, <Q>To deny ungod∣liness and worldly lusts, and to live godly, righteously, and soberly.</Q> So it is not the good works, nor the good life that brings salvation, but the grace. 'What!' said the Papist, 'doth this grace, that brings salvation, appear unto all men?' 'Yes,' said I. 'Then,' said he, 'I deny that.' I replied, 'All that deny that are sect-makers, and are not in the universal faith, grace, and truth, which the apostles were in.' Then he spoke to me about the mo∣ther-church. I told him, The several sects in Christen∣dom had accused us, and said, <Q>We forsook our mother-church.</Q> The Papists charged us with forsaking their church, saying, "Rome was the only mother-church." The Episcopalians taxed us with forsaking the old Protes∣tant religion, alleging, <Q>Theirs was the reformed mo∣ther-church.</Q> The Presbyterians and Independents blamed us for leaving them, each of them pretending "Theirs was the right-reformed church." But I said, if we could own any outward place to be the mother-church, we should own Jerusalem, where the gospel was first preached by Christ himself and the apostles, where Christ suffered, where the great conversion to Christianity by Pe∣ter was, where were the types, figures, and shadows, which Christ ended, and where Christ commanded his <Q>disci∣ples to wait until they were endued with power from on high.</Q> If any outward place deserved to be called the mother, that was the place where the first great conversion to Christianity was. But the apostle faith, Gal. iv. 25, 26. <Q>Jerusalem, which now is in bondage with her chil∣dren; but Jerusalem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband,</Q> ver. 27. The apostle doth not say, outward Jerusalem was the mother, though the first and great conversion to Christianity was there; and there is less reason for the title [mother] to be given to Rome, or to any other outward place or city, by the chil∣dren
<PB N="98" REF="037441_0614_100D9221E976DE40"/>of Jerusalem, that is above and free: neither are they Jerusalem's children that is above and free, who give the title of mother either to outward Jerusalem, to Rome, or to any other place or sect of people. And though this title [mother] hath been given to places and sects by the degenerate Christians, yet we say still, as the apostle said of old, "Jerusalem that is above, is the mother of us all." We can own no other, neither outward Jerusalem, nor Rome, nor any sect of people for our mother, but Jerusa∣lem which is above; which is free, the mother of all that are born again, become true believers in the light, and are grasted into Christ, the heavenly vine. For all who are born again of the immortal seed, by the word of God which lives and abides for ever, feed upon the milk of the word, the breast of life, grow by it in life; and cannot acknowledge any other to be their mother, but Jerusalem which is above.' 'Oh!' said squire Marsh to the Papist, You do not know this man. If he would but come to church now and then, he would be a brave man.'</P>
<P>After some other discourse, I went asid with justice Marsh to another room, to speak with him concerning friends; for he was a justice of peace for Middlesex, and be∣ing a courtier, the other justices put much of the manage∣ment of affairs upon him. He told me, <Q>He was in a strait how to act between us and some other Dissenters. For,' said he, 'You cannot swear, and the Independents, Baptists, and Fifth-monarchy-people say also, They can∣not swear; therefore,' said he, 'how shall I distinguish betwixt you and them, seeing they and you all say. It is for conscience-sake that you cannot swear?' I answered, I will shew thee how to distinguish. They, or most of them, thou speakest of, can and do swear in some cases, but we cannot swear in any case. If a man should sleal their cows and horses, and thou shouldest ask them whe∣ther they would swear they were theirs? many of them would readily do it; but if thou try our friends, they can∣not swear for their own goods. Therefore, when thou put∣test the oath of allegiance to any of them, ask them, <Q>Whether they can swear in any other case, as for their cow or horse?</Q> Which, if they be really of us, they cannot do, though they can bear witness to the truth.</Q> I gave him a relation of a trial in Berkshire, which was thus: <Q>A thief stole two beasts from a friend of ours. The thief was taken and call into prison, and the friend appeared against
<PB N="99" REF="037441_0615_100D92237A8A7728"/>him at the assizes. But somebody having informed the judge, that the prosecutor was a Quaker and could not swear, the judge, before he heard the friend, said, <Q>Is he a Quaker? And will he not swear? Then tender him the oaths of allegiance and supremacy.</Q> So he cast the friend into prison, and premunired him, and set the thief at li∣berty.' Justice Marsh said, 'That judge was a wicked man. 'But,' said I, 'If we could swear in any case, we would take the oath of allegiance to the king, who is to pre∣serve the laws that are to support every man in his estate. Whereas others, that can swear in some cases, to preserve a part of their estates if they be robbed, will not take this oath to the king, who is to preserve them in their whole estates and bodies also. So that thou mayest easily dis∣tinguish and put a difference betwixt us and those people.</Q> Justice Marsh was afterwards very serviceable to friends in this and other cases; for he kept several, both friends and others, from being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emonired: and when friends were brought before him, in time of persecution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set many of them at liberty. When he could not avoid sending to pri∣son, he sent some for a few hours, or a night. At length he went to the king, and told him, <Q>He had sent some of us to prison contrary to his conscience, and he could not do so any more.</Q> Therefore he removed his family from Limehouse, where he lived, and took lodgings near James's Park. He told the king, <Q>If he would be pleased to give liberty of conscience, that would quiet and settle all; for then none could have any pretence to be uneasy.</Q> And indeed he was a very serviceable man to truth and friends in his day.</P>
<P>We had great service at London this year; the Lord's truth came over all. Many who had gone out came in again this year, confesting and condemning their outgoings.</P>
<P>After I had staid some time in London, I visited friends in Surry, Sussex, and other places that way, and then tra∣velled northward, having Leonard Fell with me. We vi∣sited friends till we came to Warwick, where many were in prison. We had a meeting in the town. I passed from thence to Birmingham and Badgely. At Badgely I had a large meeting. After which I passed to Nottingham, where on the first-day we had a precious meeting, but not without danger of being apprehended; the constables having threat∣ened friends.</P>
<P>I passed from thence, visiting friends, ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l I came to Bal.
<PB N="100" REF="037441_0616_100D92E63B6FE588"/>by, and so to York quarterly-meeting. A blessed meeting we had. Friends had in Yorkshire seven monthly meetings before, and they were so sensible of the service of them, that they desired to have seven more added; for truth was much spread in that county. Accordingly in that quarterly meet∣ing they were settled: so now they have fourteen monthly meetings.</P>
<P>It being the assize-time at York, I met with justice Ho∣tham, a well-wisher to friends, who had been tender and very kind to me from the first.</P>
<P>After I had finished my service in York, I passed into the country. As I went, a great burden fell upon me; but I did not presently know the reason of it. I came to a meeting on first-day at Richard Shipton's, which was very large. There being a meeting the same day at another place, and the priest of that place, being misinformed that I was to be there, got a warrant, and made great disturbance at that meeting; of which Isaac Lindley gave me an account by the following letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>WHEN thou went'st from York, the first-day after thou wast at Richard Shipton's, that day I had ap∣pointed a meeting ten miles from York, where there had not been a meeting before. But the priest and the constable got a warrant on the seventh-day, and put thy name only in the warrant; for they had heard thou wast to be there. They came with weapons and staves, and cried, <Q>Where is Mr. Fox?</Q> over and over; many friends being there, they concluded thou wast among them. But those raveners, being disappointed, plucked me down, abused me, beat some friends, and then took me before a magistrate; but he set me at liberty.</P>

<P>I then visited friends at Whitby and Scarborough. When I was at Scarborough, the governor, hearing I was come, sent to invite me to his house, saying, <Q>Surely, I would not be so unkind, as not to come and see him and his wife.</Q> After the meeting I went to visit him, and he received me very courteously and lovingly.</P>
<P>Having visited most of the meetings in Yorkshire, the Woulds, and Holderness, I came to Henry Jackson's, where
<PB N="101" REF="037441_0617_100D7F9C8094DD60"/>I had a great meeting. From thence to Thomas Taylor's, and to John Moor's at Eldreth, where we had a very large meeting: the Lord's power and presence was eminently amongst us. Not far from this place lay colonel Kirby, lame of the gout, who had threatened, <Q>If ever I came near, he would send me to prison again; and had bid forty pounds to any man that could take me,</Q> as I was credibly informed.</P>
<P>After this I came into Staffordshire and Cheshire, where we had many large and precious meetings. I had a very large one at William Barns's, about two miles from War∣rington; and though colonel Kirby was now got abroad again, as violent in breaking up meetings as before, and was then at Warrington, the Lord did not suffer him to come to this meeting: so we were preserved out of his hands.</P>
<P>Now was I moved of the Lord to go over into Ireland, to visit the seed of God in that nation. There went with me Robert Lodge, James Lancaster, Thomas Briggs, and John Stubbs. We waited near Liverpool for shipping and wind. After we had waited some days, we sent James Lan∣caster, who took passage, and brought word the ship was ready, and would take us in at Black-rock. We went thi∣ther on foot. It being pretty fair and the weather very hot, I was much spent with walking. When we arrived the ship was not there, so we were o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ged to go to the town and take shipping. When we were get on board, I said to the rest of the company, <Q>Come, ye will triumph in the Lord; for we shall have fair wind and weather.</Q> There were many passengers in the ship sick, but not one of our company. The master and many of the passengers were very loving; and being at sea on a first-day, I was moved to declare truth among them: whereupon the master said to the passengers, <Q>Come, here are things that you never heard in your lives.</Q> When we came before Dublin, we took boat, and went ashore; and the earth and air smelt, me∣thought, with the corruption of the nation, so that it yielded another smell to me than England did; which I imputed to the popish massacres that had been committed, and the blood that had been spilt in it, from which a foulness as∣cended. We passed through among the officers of the cus∣toms four times, yet they did not search us; for they per∣ceived what we were. Some of them were so envious, they did not care to look at us. We did not presently sind friends; but went to an inn, and sent to inquire for some,
<PB N="102" REF="037441_0618_100D7FAA5ED58248"/>who were exceeding glad of our coming, and received us with great joy. We staid there the weekly meeting, which was a large one, and the power and life of God appeared greatly in it. Afterwards we passed to a province-meeting, which lasted two days, there being both a men's meeting about the poor, and another more general, in which a migh∣ty power of the Lord appeared. Truth was livingly de∣clared, and friends were much refreshed therein.</P>
<P>Passing from thence about twenty-four miles, we came to another place, where we had a very good refreshing meet∣ing; after which some Papists were angry, and raged very much. When I heard of it, I sent for one of them, a schoolmaster; but he would not come. Whereupon I sent a challenge to him, with all the friars, monks, priests, and jesuits, to come forth, and <Q>try their God and their Christ, which they made of bread and wine;</Q> but no an∣swer could I get from them. Wherefore I told them, <Q>They were worse than the priests of Baal; for Baal's priests tried their wooden god, but these durst not try their god of bread and wine; and Baal's priests and people did not eat their god, as these did, and then make another.</Q></P>
<P>We went on to New-garden, where was a great meeting. From thence we travelled to Bandon-bridge and the Land's-end, having many meetings as we went; in which the mighty power of the Lord was manifested, friends were well refreshed, and many people were affected with the truth. At Bandon, the mayor's wife, being convinced, de∣sired her husband to come to the meeting; but he bid her for her life she should not make known that I was at a meeting there.</P>
<P>He that was then mayor of Cork, being very envious against truth and friends, had many friends in prison; and knowing I was in the country, he sent four warrants to take me; therefore friends were desirous that I might not ride through Cork. But being at Bandon, there appeared to me in a vision, <Q>A very ugly-visaged man, of a black and dark look. My spirit struck at him in the power of God, and it seemed to me that I rode over him with my horse, and my horse set his soot on the side of his face.</Q> When I came down in the morning, I told a friend, the command of the Lord was to me to ride through Cork; but bid him tell no man. So we took horse, many friends be∣ing with me. When we came near the town, friends would have shewed me a way on the backside of it; but I told
<PB N="103" REF="037441_0619_100D92256E903A20"/>them, my way was through the streets. Taking Paul Mor∣rice to guide me through the town, I rode on; and as we rode through the market-place, and by the mayor's door, he, seeing me, said, 'There goes George Fox;' but he had not power to stop me. When we had passed through the centinels, and were come over the bridge, we went to a friend's house, and alighted. There the friends told me, what a rage was in the town, and how many warrants were granted to take me. While I was sitting there with friends, I felt the evil spirit at work in the town, stirring up mis∣chief against me; and I felt the power of the Lord strike at that evil spirit. By-and-by some other friends coming in, told me, <Q>It was over the town, and amongst the magis∣trates, that I was in the town.</Q> I said, <Q>Let the devil do his worst,</Q> After awhile that friends were refreshed one in another, and we travellers had refreshed ourselves, I call∣ed for my horse, and having a friend to guide me, we went on our way. But great was the rage that the mayor and others of Cork were in, that they had missed me, and great pains they afterwards took to have taken me, having their scouts abroad upon the roads, as I understood, to observe which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I went. Afterwards, scarce a public meeting I came to, but spies came to watch if I was there. And the envious magistrates and priests sent informations one to another concerning me, describing me by my hair, hat, cloaths, and horse; so that when I was near an hundred miles from Cork they had an account concerning me, and description of me, before I came amongst them. One very envious magistrate, who was both a priest and a justice, got a warrant from the judge of assize to apprehend me; the warrant was to go over all his circuit, which reached near an hundred miles. Yet the Lord disappointed all their councils, defeated all their designs against me, and by his good hand of Providence preserved me out of all their snares, and gave us many sweet and blessed opportunities to visit friends, and spread truth through that nation. For meetings were very large, friends coming to them far and near; and other people flocking in. The powerful pre∣sence of the Lord was preciously felt with and amongst us; whereby many of the world were reached, convinced, ga∣thered to the truth, and the Lord's flock was increased; and friends were greatly refreshed and comforted in feeling the love of God. Oh! the brokenness that was amongst them in the flowings of life! So that, in the power and Spirit
<PB N="104" REF="037441_0620_100D922724C4B070"/>of the Lord, many together broke out into singing, even with audible voices, making melody in their hearts.</P>
<P>At which time I was moved to declare to friends there in the ministry, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>SOUND, sound abroad, you faithful servants of the Lord, witnesses in his name, faithful servants, pro∣phets of the Highest, and angels of the Lord! Sound ye all abroad in the world, to the awakening and raising of the dead, that they may be awakened and raised up out of the grave, to hear the voice that is living. For the dead have long heard the dead, the blind have long wan∣dered among the blind, and the deaf amongst the deaf. Therefore sound, ye servants, prophets, and angels of the Lord, ye trumpets of the Lord, that you may awaken the dead, awaken them that are asleep in their graves of sin, death, and hell, sea and earth, and who lie in the tombs. Sound abroad, ye trumpets, and raise up the dead, that they may hear the voice of the Son of God, the voice of the Second Adam that never fell, the voice of the Light, the voice of the Life, the voice of the Power, the voice of the Truth, the voice of the Righteous, and the voice of the Just. Sound ye the trumpets, the melodious sound abroad, that all the deaf ears may be opened to hear the pleasant sound of the trumpet to judgment and life, to con∣demnation and light. Sound your trumpets all abroad, you angels of the Lord, sons and daughters, prophets of the Highest, that all that are dead and asleep in the graves, who have been long dreaming and slumbering, may be awakened and hear the voice of the Lamb, who have long heard the voice of the beast, that now they may hear the voice of the Bridegroom, the voice of the Bride, the voice of the Great Prophet, the voice of the Great King, the voice of the Great Shepherd and Bishop of their souls. Sound it all abroad, ye trumpets, among the dead in Adam; for Christ is come, the second Adam, that they might have life, yea have it abundantly. Awaken the dead, awaken the slumberers, awaken the dreamers, awaken them that are asleep, awaken them out of their graves, out of their tombs, out of their sepulchres, out of the seas! Sound abroad, ye trumpets, that awaken the dead, that they may all hear the sound of it in the graves, and they that hear may live and come to the Life, that is, the Son of God. He is risen from the dead, the grave could not
<PB N="105" REF="037441_0621_100D9229D7E60AC0"/>hold nor contain him, neither could all the watchers of the earth, with all their guards, keep him therein. Sound, ye trumpets of the Lord, to all the seekers of the living among the dead, that he is risen from the dead; to all the seekers of the living among the dead, and in the graves that the watchers keep; he is not in the grave, he is risen; and there is that under the grave of the watchers of the out∣ward grave, which must be awakened and come to hear his voice, who is risen from the dead, that they might come to live. Therefore sound abroad, you trumpets of the Lord, that the grave might give up her dead, and hell and the sea might give up their dead; and all might come forth to judgment, to the judgment of the Lord before his throne, and have their sentence and reward according to their works.</P>
<P>Away with all the chaff and the husks, and contentions and strife, that the swine feed upon in the mire, and in the fall; and the keepers of them of Adam and Eve's house in the fall; that lies in the mire, out of light and life.</P>

<P>To James Hutchinson's in Ireland came many great per∣sons, desiring to discourse with me about Election and Re∣probation. I told them, <Q>Though they judged our prin∣ciple foolish, it was too high for them, they could not with their wisdom comprehend it; therefore I would discourse, with them according to their capacities. You say,</Q> said I, <Q>that God hath ordained the greatest part of men for hell, and that they were ordained so before the world began; for which your proof is in Jude. You say, Esau was reprobated, and the Egyptians, and the stock of Ham. But Christ saith to his disciples, "Go, teach all nations;" and, <Q>Go into all nations, and preach the gospel of life and salva∣tion.</Q> If they were to go to all nations, were they not to go to Ham's stock, and Esau's stock? Did not Christ die for all? Then for the stock of Ham, of Esau, and the Egyptians. Doth not the scripture say, <Q>God would have all men to be saved?</Q> Mark, "All men;" then the stock of Esau, and of Ham also. Doth not God say, "Egypt my people?" and that he would have an altar in Egypt? Isa. xix. Were there not many Christians for∣merly in Egypt? And doth not history say, that the bi∣shop of Alexandria would formerly have been pope? And
<PB N="106" REF="037441_0622_100D922B68F99BD8"/>had not God a church in Babylon? I confess, <Q>The word come to Jacob, and the statutes to Israel; the like was not to other nations.</Q> For the law of God was given to Israel; but the gospel was to be preached to all nations, and is to be preached. The gospel of peace and glad-tid∣ings to all nations. <Q>He that believes is saved, but he that doth not believe is condemned already;</Q> so the con∣demnation comes through unbelief. And whereas Jude speaks of some that were of old ordained (or written of be∣fore) to condemnation, he doth not say, before the world began; but, "written of old;" which may be referred to Moses's writings, who wrote of those whom Jude men∣tions, namely Cain, Corah, Balaam, and the angels that kept not their first estate; and such Christians as followed them in their way, and apostatized from the first state of Christianity, were and are ordained for condemnation by the light and truth, which they are gone from. And though the apostle speaks of God's loving Jacob and hating Esau, yet he tells the believers, <Q>We all were by nature children of wrath, as well as others.</Q> This includes the stock of Jacob, of which the apostle himself and all believ∣ing Jews were. Thus both Jews and Gentiles were all concluded under sin, and so under condemnation, that God might have mercy upon all through Jesus Christ. The election and choice stands in Christ: <Q>and he that believes is saved, and he that believes not is condemned already.</Q> Jacob typifies the second birth, which God loved; and both Jews and Gentiles must be born again, before they can enter the kingdom of God. When you are born again, ye will know election and reprobation; for the election stands in Christ, the seed, before the world began; but the reprobation lies in the evil seed since the word began.</Q> After this manner, but somewhat more largely, I discoursed with those great persons about this mat∣ter, and they confessed they had never heard so much be∣fore.</P>
<P>After I had travelled over Ireland, and visited friends in their meetings, as well for business as worship, and answer∣ed several papers and writings from monks, friars, and Pro∣testant priests (for they all were in a rage against us, and endeavoured to stop the work of the Lord, and some Jesuits swore in some of our hearing, that we came to spread our principles in that nation, but we should not do it) I return∣ed to Dublin, in order to take passage for England. When
<PB N="107" REF="037441_0623_100D922D5CF36468"/>I had staid the first-day's meeting there, which was very large and precious, there being a ship ready, and the wind serving, we took our leave of friends; parting in much ten∣derness and brokenness, in the sense of the heavenly life and power, manifested amongst us. Having put our horses and necessaries on board in the morning, we went ourselves in the afternoon, many friends accompanying us to the ship; and divers friends and friendly people followed us in boats, when we were near a league at sea, their love drawing them, though not without danger. A good, weighty, and true people there is in that nation, sensible of the power of the Lord God, tender of his truth, and very good order they have in their meetings; for they stand up for righteousness and holiness, which dams up the way of wickedness. A precious visitation they had, and there is an excellent spirit in them, worthy to be visited. Many things more I could write of that nation, and of my travels in it, which would be large to mention particularly; but thus much I thought good to signify, that the righteous may rejoice in the pros∣perity of truth.</P>
<P>James Lancaster, Robert Lodge, and Thomas Briggs came back with me; John Stubbs, having further service there, staid behind. We were two nights at sea; in one of which a mighty storm arose that put the vessel in great danger; but I saw the power of God went over the winds and storms, he had them in his hand, and his power bound them. And the same power of the Lord God, which carri∣ed us over, brought us back again; and in his life gave us dominion over all the evil spirits that opposed us there.</P>
<P>We landed at Liverpool, and went to Richard John∣son's, William Barnes's, and to William Gandy's, visiting friends, and having many precious meetings in Lancashire and Cheshire. We came into Gloucestershire, and met with a report at Nailsworth, which was spread in that coun∣try, <Q>That George Fox was turned Presbyterian, that a pulpit was prepared for him and set in a yard, and that there would be a thousand people there the next day to hear him.</Q> I thought it strange that such a report should be raised of me; yet as we went further from one friend's house to another, we met with the same. We passed by the yard where the pulpit was, and saw it, and went to the place where friends meeting was to be next day, where we staid that night. Next day, being the first-day, we had a
<PB N="108" REF="037441_0624_100D922FCB0AF720"/>very large meeting, and the Lord's power and presence was amongst us.</P>
<P>The occasion of this strange report (as I was informed) was this. There was one John Fox, a Presbyterian priest, who used to go about preaching; and some, changing his name from John to George, gave out that George Fox was turned from a Quaker to be a Presbyterian, and would preach at such a place such a day. This begat such curiosity in the people, that they went thither to hear this Quaker turned Presbyterian, who would not have gone to have heard John Fox himself. By this means it was reported they had go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together above a thousand people. But when they came there, and perceived they had a trick put upon them, that he was but a counterfeit George Fox, and understood that the real George Fox was hard by, several hundreds came to our meeting and were sober and attentive. <Q>I directed them to the grace of God in themselves, which would teach them, and bring them salvation.</Q> When the meet∣ing was over, some of the people said, <Q>They like George Fox the Quaker's preaching better than George Fox the Presbyterian's.</Q> Thus, by my providential coming into those parts at that time, this false report was discovered, and shame came over the contrivers of it.</P>
<P>Not long after this John Fox was complained of in the house of commons, for <Q>having a tumultuous meeting, in which treasonable words were spoken:</Q> which (according to the best information I could get) was thus. John Fox had formerly been priest of Mansfield in Wiltshire; and, being put out of that place, was afterwards permitted by a Common-prayer priest to preach sometimes in his steeple∣house. At length this Presbyterian priest, presuming too far upon the parish priest's former grant, began to be more bold than welcome, and attempted to preach there whether the parish priest would or no. This caused a great bustle and contest in the steeple-house between the two priests, and their hearers on either side; in which contest the Common∣prayer-book was cut to pieces, and some treasonable words spoken by some of the followers of John Fox. This was quickly put in the news, and some malicious Presbyterians cansed it to be so worded as if it had proceeded from George Fox the Quaker, though I was above two hundred miles from the place when this bustle happened. When I heard of it. I soon procured certificates from some of the members of the house of commons, who knew this man, and gave it
<PB N="109" REF="037441_0625_100D9231BADF7110"/>under their hands, that it was J. Fox, who had formerly been parson of Mansfield in Wiltshire, that was complained of to the house of commons, to be the chief ringleader in that unlawful assembly.</P>
<P>And indeed this John Fox discovered himself to be an ill man, for some who had been his followers came to be convinced of truth, and thereupon left him; upon which he came to some of their houses to talk with them; and they telling him, <Q>He was in the steps of the false prophets, preaching for hire and filthy lucre, like those whom Christ cried wo against, and the apostles declared against, such as served not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies, and telling him, Christ said, Freely ye have received, freely give, and therefore he should not take money of people for preaching, especially now time were so hard;</Q> he replied, <Q>God bless preaching, that brings in money, let times go how they will. Fill my belly with good victuals; then call me false prophet, or what you will, and kick me about the house when ye have done, if ye will.</Q> This re∣lation I had from a man and his wife, who had been for∣merly his hearers, and whom John Fox (with others) caus∣ed deeply to suffer. For he, and some other Presbyterian priests, resorting to a widow woman's, who had the impro∣priation, and took the tithes of the parish, she told them, <Q>There was a Quaker in that parish that would not pay her tithes;</Q> and asked, what she should do with him. They advised her, <Q>To send workmen to cut down and carry away his corn:</Q> which she did, and thereby impove∣rished the man. But to proceed.—</P>
<P>After this meeting in Gloucestershire, we travelled till we came to Bristol; where I met with Margaret Fell, who was come to visit her daughter Yeomans. I had seen from the Lord a considerable time before, that I should take Marga∣ret Fell to be my wife; and when I first mentioned it to her, she felt the answer of Life from God thereunto. But though the Lord had opened this thing to me, yet I had not received a command from him for the accomplishing of it then. Wherefore I let the thing rest, and went on in the work and service of the Lord, according as he led me; tra∣velling in this nation, and through Ireland. But now be∣ing at Bristol, and finding Margaret Fell there, it opened in me from the Lord that the thing should be accomplished. After we had discoursed the matter together, I told her, <Q>If she also was satisfied with the accomplishing of it now,
<PB N="110" REF="037441_0626_100D92334D311EF8"/>she should first send for her children:</Q> which she did. When the rest of her daughters were come. I asked both them and her sons-in-law, <Q>If they had any thing against it, or for it?</Q> and they all severally expressed their satisfaction therewith. Then I asked Margaret, <Q>If she had fulfilled her husband's will to her children?</Q> She replied, <Q>The children knew she had.</Q> Whereupon I asked them, <Q>Whether, if their mother married, they should not lose by it?</Q> I asked Margaret, <Q>Whether she had done any thing in lieu of it, which might answer it to the children?</Q> The children said, <Q>She had answered it to them, and desired me to speak no more of it.</Q> I told them, <Q>I was plain, and would have all things done plainly: for I sought not any outward advantage to myself.</Q> So our intention of marriage was laid before friends both privately and publick∣ly, to their full satisfaction, many of whom gave testimony that it was of God. Afterwards, a meeting being appoint∣ed on purpose for the accomplishing thereof, in the publick meeting-house at Broad Mead in Bristol, we took each other in marriage; the Lord joining us together in the ho∣nourable marriage, in the everlasting covenant and immor∣tal Seed of life. In the sense whereof, living and weighty testimonies were borne thereunto by friends in the movings of the heavenly power, which united us together. Then was a certificate, relating both the proceedings and the mar∣riage, openly read, and signed by the relations, and by most of the ancient friends of that city; besides many others from divers parts of the nation.</P>
<P>We staid about a week in Bristol, and then went toge∣ther to Oldstone: where, taking leave of each other in the Lord, we parted, betaking ourselves each to our several ser∣vice; Margaret returning homewards to the north, and I passing on in the work of the Lord as before. I travelled through Wiltshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckingham∣shire, and so to London, visiting friends: in all which counties I had many large and precious meetings.</P>
<P>Being in London, it came upon me to write to friends throughout the nation, about <Q>putting out poor children to trades.</Q> Wherefore I sent the following epistle to the quarterly meetings of friends in all the counties.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET every quarterly meeting make inquiry through all the monthly and other meetings, to know all friends
<PB N="111" REF="037441_0627_100D9234DE84AEE0"/>that are widows, or others, that have children fit to put out to apprenticeships; so that once a quarter you may set forth an apprentice from your quarterly meeting; so you may set forth four in a year, in each county, or more, if there be occasion. This apprentice, when out of his time, may help his father or mother, and support the family that is decayed; and, in so doing, all may come to live comfortably. This being done in your quarterly meet∣ings, ye will have knowledge through the county, in the monthly and particular meetings, of masters fit for them; and of such trades as their parents or you desire, or the children are most inclinable to. Thus being placed out to friends, they may be trained up in truth; and by this means in the wisdom of God, you may preserve friends children in the truth, and enable them to be a strength and help to their families, and nursers and preservers of their relations in their ancient days. Thus also, things being ordered in the wisdom of God, you will take off a continual maintenance, and free yourselves from much cumber. For in the country, ye know, ye may set forth an apprentice for a little to several trades, as brick∣layers, masons, carpenters, wheelwrights, ploughwrights, taylors, tanners, curriers, blacksmiths, shoemakers, nail∣ers, butchers, weavers of linen and woollen, stuffs and serges, &amp;c. And you may do well to have a stock in your quarterly meetings for that purpose. All that is given by any friends at their decease (except it be given to some particular use, person, or meeting) may be brought to the publick stock for that purpose. This will be a way for the preserving of many that are poor among you; and it will be a way of making up poor families. In several counties it is practised already. Some quarterly meetings set forth two apprentices; and sometimes the children of others that are laid on the parish. You may bind them for fewer or more years, according to their capacities. In all things the wisdom of God will teach you; by which ye may help the children of poor friends, that they may come to support their families, and preserve them in the fear of God. So no more, but my love in the everlasting Seed, by which ye will have wisdom to order all things to the glory of God.</P>

I staid not long in London; but having visited friends, and finding things there quiet and well, the Lord's power being over all, I passed into Essex and Hertfordshire, where I had many precious meetings. Intending to go as far as Leicestershire, I wrote a letter to my wife, to acquaint her therewith; that, if she found it convenient, she might meet me there. From Hertfordshire I turned into Cam∣bridgeshire; thence into Huntingdonshire, and so into Lei∣cestershire; where, instead, of meeting my wife, I heard she was haled out of her house to Lancaster prison, by an order got from the king and council, to fetch her back to prison upon the old premunire; though she had been dis∣charged from that imprisonment by an order from the king and council the year before. Wherefore, having visited friends as far as Leicestershire, I returned by Derbyshire and Warwickshire to London; having had many large and bles∣sed meetings in the several counties I passed through, and been sweetly refreshed amongst friends in my travels.</P>
<P>As soon as I was got to London, I hastened Mary Lower and Sarah Fell (two of my wife's daughters) to the king, to acquaint him how their mother was dealt with, and see if they could get a full discharge for her, that she might en∣joy her estate and liberty without molestation. This was somewhat difficult, but by diligent attendance they at length obtained it; the king giving command to Sir John Otway to signify his pleasure therein by letter to the sheriff, and others concerned in the country. Which letter Sarah Fell, going down with her brother and sister Rous, carried with her to Lancaster; and by them I wrote to my wife, as followeth:</P>

<P>My dear heart in the truth and life, that changeth not,</P>
<P>IT was upon me that Mary Lower and Sarah should go to the king concerning thy imprisonment; and to Kirby, that the power of the Lord might appear over them all in thy deliverance. They went; and then thought to have come down; but it was upon me to stay them a little lon∣ger, that they might follow the business till it was effected: which it now is, and is here sent. The late declaration of mine hath been very serviceable, people being generally satisfied with it. So no more but my love in the holy Seed.</P>

The declaration here mentioned was a printed sheet, written upon occasion of a new persecution stirred up. For by that time I was got to London, a fresh storm was risen, occasioned, it was thought, by that tumultuous meeting in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> steeple-house in Wiltshire or Gloucestershire, mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little before, from which, as it was said, some members of parliament took advantage to get an act passed against sedi∣tious conventicles; which soon after came forth, and was turned against us, who of all people were free from sedition and tumult. Whereupon I wrote a declaration, shewing from the preamble and terms of the act that we were not such a people, nor our meetings such as were described in that act. Besides that declaration, I wrote also another short paper, on the occasion of that act against meetings; opening our case to the magistrates, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O FRIENDS, consider this act, which limits our meetings to five. Is this, to do as ye would be done by?' Would ye be so served yourselves? We own Christ Jesus as well as you, his coming, death, and resur∣rection; and if we be contrary minded to you in some things, is not this the apostle's exhortation, to <Q>wait till God hath revealed it?</Q> Doth not he say, What is not of faith, is sin?' Seeing we have not faith in things which ye would have us to do, would it not be sin in us if we should act contrary to our faith? Why should any man have power over any other man's faith, seeing Christ is the author of it? When the apostles preached in the name of Jesus, and great multitudes heard them, and the rulers forbad them to speak my more in that name, did not they bid them judge whether it were better to obey God or man? Would not this act have taken hold of the twelve apostles and seventy disciples; for they met often together? If there had been a law made then, that not above five should have met with Christ, would not that have been an hindering him from meeting with his disciples? Do ye think that he, who is the wisdom of God, or his disciples, would have obeyed it? If such a law had been made in the apostles days, that not above five might have met to∣gether, who had been different minded from either the Jews or the Gentiles, do ye think the churches of Christ at Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus. Thessalonica, or the rest of the gathered churches, would have obeyed it? O there∣fore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>! for we are Christians, and partake of the

<P>As I had endeavoured to soften the magistrates, and to take off the sharpness of their edge in the execution of the act, so it was upon me to write a few lines to friends, to <Q>strengthen and encourage them to stand fast in their testi∣mony, and bear, with Christian patience and content, the suffering that was coming upon them.</Q></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY dear friends, Keep in the faith of God above all outward things and in his power, that hath given you dominion over all. The same power of God is still with you to deliver you as formerly: for God and his power is the same; his Seed is over all, and before all; and will be, when that which makes to suffer is gone. Be of good faith in that which changeth not; for whatsoever any doth against the truth it will come upon themselves, and fall as a mill-stone on their heads. If the Lord suffer you to be tried, let all be given up; look at the Lord and his power, which is over the whole world, and will re∣main when the world is gone. In the Lord's power and truth rejoice, friends, over that which makes to suffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Seed, which was before it was; for the life, truth, and power of God is over all.

<P>On the next first-day after the act came in force, I went to the meeting-house at Gracechurch-street, where I expect∣ed the storm was most likely to begin. When I came there, I found the street full of people, and a guard set to keep friends out of their meeting-house. I went to the other pas∣sage, out of Lombard-street, where also I found a guard; but the court was full of people, and a friend was speaking amongst them: but spoke not long. When he had done, I stood up, and was moved to say, <Q>Saul, Saul, why per∣secutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against that which pricks thee. Then I shewed, it is Saul's nature that persecutest still; and that they, who persecute Christ in his members now, where he is made manifest, kick against that which pricks them. That it was the birth of the flesh that persecuted the birth born of the Spirit; and that it was the nature of dogs to tear and devour the sheep; but that we suffered as sheep that bite not again; for we were a peaceable people, and loved them that persecuted us.</Q> After I had spoken awhile to this effect, the constable came with an informer and soldiers; and as they plucked me down, I said, 'Blessed are the peace-makers.' The com∣mander of the soldiers put me among the soldiers, and bid them secure me, saying to me, <Q>You are the man I looked for.</Q> They took also John Burneyate, with another friend, and had us away first to the Exchange, and after∣wards towards Moorfields. As we went along the streets the people were very moderate. Some of them laughed at the constable, and told him, 'We would not run away.' The informer went with us unknown; till falling into dis∣course with one of the company, he said, <Q>It would never be a good world till all people came to the good old reli∣gion that was too hundred years ago.</Q> Whereupon I ask∣ed him, <Q>Art thou a Papist? What! a Papist informer? for two hundred years ago there was no other religion but that of the Papists.</Q> He saw he had ensnared himself, and was vexed at it; for as he went along the streets, I spoke often to him, and manifested what he was. When we were come to the mayor's house, and were in the court-yard, se∣veral
<PB N="116" REF="037441_0632_100D923E93202610"/>asked me, 'How and for what I was taken?' ... I desir∣ed them to ask the informer; and also know what his name was: but he refused to tell his name. Whereupon one of the mayor's officers looking out at a window, told him, <Q>He should tell his name before he went away: for the lord mayor would know by what authority he intruded himself with soldiers into the execution of those laws which belonged to the civil magistrate to execute, and not to the military. After this, he was eager to be gone; and went to the porter to be let out. One of the officers called to him, saying. Have you brought people here to inform against, and now will you go away before my lord mayor comes?</Q> Some called to the porter not to let him out; whereupon he forci∣bly pulled open the door and slipped out. No sooner was he come into the street but the people gave a shout, that made the street ring again, crying out, <Q>A Papist informer! A Papist informer!</Q> We desired the constable and soldiers to go and rescue him out of the people's hands, lest they should do him a mischief. They went, and brought him into the mayor's entry, where we staid awhile: but when he went out again, the people received him with such ano∣ther shout. Whereupon the soldiers were obliged to rescue him once more; and then they had him into an house in an alley, where they persuaded him to change his perriwig, so he got away unknown.</P>
<P>When the mayor came, we were brought into the room where he was, and some of his officers would have taken off our hats; which he perceiving, bid them, <Q>let us alone, and not meddle with our hats; for,</Q> said he, <Q>they are not yet brought before me in judicature.</Q> So we stood by, while he examined some Presbyterian and Baptist teachers; with whom he was somewhat sharp, and convicted them. After he had done with them, I was brought to the table where he sat; and then the officers took off my hat. The mayor said mildly to me, <Q>Mr. Fox, you are an eminent man amongst those of your profession; pray, will you be instrumental to dissuade them from meeting in such great numbers? for, seeing Christ hath promised, that where two or three are met in his name, he will be in the midst of them; and the king and parliament are graciously pleased to allow of four to meet together to worship God; why will not you be content to partake both of Christ's promise to two or three and the king's indulgence to four?</Q> I answered to this pur∣pose: <Q>Christ's promise was not to discourage many from
<PB N="117" REF="037441_0633_100D9241374425C8"/>meeting together in his name; but to encourage the few, that the fewest might not forbear to meet, because of their fewness. But if Christ hath promised to manifest his pre∣sence in the midst of so small an assembly, where but two or three were gathered in his name, how much more would his presence abound, where two or three hundred are ga∣thered in his name? I wished him to consider whether this act would not have taken hold of Christ, with his twelve apostles and seventy disciples (if it had been in their time) who used to meet often together, and that in great numbers? However, I told him this act did not concern us; for it was made against seditious meetings, of such as met, under colour and pretence of religion, to contrive in∣surrections, as (the act says) late experience had shewn; but we had been sufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable; therefore he should do well to put a dif∣ference between the innocent and the guilty.</Q> He said, <Q>The act was made against meetings, and a worship not ac∣cording to the liturgy.</Q> I told him, <Q>[According to] was not the very same thing; and asked him, whether the li∣turgy was according to the scriptures? And whether we might not read scriptures, and speak scriptures? He said, Yes. I told him, This act took hold only of such as met to plot and contrive insurrections, as late experience had shewn; but they had never experienced that by us. Be∣cause thieves are sometimes on the road, must not honest men travel? And because plotters and contrivers have met to do mischief, must not an honest, peaceable people meet to do good? If we had been a people that met to plot and contrive insurrections, &amp;c. we might have drawn ourselves into fours; for four might do more mischief in plotting than if there were four hundred, because four might speak out their minds more freely to one another than four hun∣dred could. Therefore we being innocent, and not the people this act concerns, we keep our meetings as we used to do; and I said, I believed that he knew in his consci∣ence we were innocent.</Q> After some more discourse he took our names, and the places where we lodged, and at length, as the informer was gone, set us at liberty.</P>
<P>Being at liberty, the friends with me asked, <Q>Whi∣ther I would go?</Q> I told them, <Q>To Gracechurch-street meeting again, if it was not over.</Q> When we came there, the people were generally gone; only some few stood at the gate. We went into Gerrard Roberts's. From thence
<PB N="118" REF="037441_0634_100D9242C9D97430"/>I sent to know how the other meetings in the city were? And understood, that at some of the meeting-places friends were kept out; at others they were taken, but set at liberty again a few days after. A glorious time it was; for the Lord's power came over all, and his everlasting truth got renown. For as fast as some, that were speaking, were ta∣ken down, others were moved of the Lord of stand up and speak, to the admiration of the people; and the more, be∣cause many Baptists and other sectaries left their publick meetings, and came to see how the Quakers would stand. As for the informer aforesaid, he was so frighted, that there durst hardly any informer appear publickly again in Lon∣don for some time after. But the mayor, whose name was Samuel Starling, though he carried himself smoothly towards us, proved afterwards a very great persecutor of our friends, many of whom he cast into prison, as may be seen in the trials of W. Penn, W. Mead, and others at the Old Bailey this year.</P>
<P>After some time the heat of persecution in the city be∣gan to abate, and meetings were quieter there. I being then clear of the city, went to visit friends in the country; and attended several meetings in Middlesex, Buckingham∣shire, and Oxfordshire, which were quiet, though in some places there was much threatening. At Reading most of the friends were in prison; and I went to visit them. When I had been awhile with them, the friends that were prisoners gathered together, and several other persons came in; so I had a fine opportunity amongst them, and <Q>declared the word of life, encouraging them in the truth; and they were refreshed in feeling the presence and power of the Lord amongst them.</Q> When the meeting was ended, the gaoler understanding I was there, friends were concerned how to get me safe out again; for they feared he should stop me. After I had staid awhile, and eat with them, I went down stairs, and the gaoler being at the door, I put my hand in my pocket, which he had such an eye to, hoping to get something of me, that he asked me no question. So I gave him something, and bad him <Q>be kind and civil to my friends in prison, whom I came to visit;</Q> and he let me pass out without interruption. But soon after Isaac Penington coming to visit them, he stopped him, and caused him to be made a prisoner.</P>
<P>Next morning I rode to a meeting at Baghurst in Hamp∣shire, Thomas Briggs being with me. When we came into
<PB N="119" REF="037441_0635_100D92445BFD7B48"/>the parish, some sober people told us, <Q>the priest of the town was an envious man, and did threaten us.</Q> We went to the meeting, which was large, and after some time Thomas Briggs stood up and spoke. It seems the priest had got a warrant, and sent the constables and other officers with it. They came to the house, staid awhile, and then went away, but did not come into the meeting; so we in the meeting did not know of their being there. After Tho∣mas Briggs had done speaking, I was moved of the Lord to stand up, and declare the word of life to the people; and a precious meeting we had. When the meeting was ended and risen, I heard a great clutter in the yard; and when we came out, the man of the house told us, <Q>The officers had been in the house before, and did not come into the meet∣ing, but went away without doing any thing. And that now the priest in a great rage had sent them again, and his own servant with them.</Q> But the meeting being ended before they came, they could do nothing. Thus the good providence of the Lord preserved us from the wicked de∣sign of the envious priest.</P>
<P>From thence we went to a friend's on the edge of Berkshire, where several friends came to visit us. Afterwards we passed into Surry, and had many precious meetings, till we came to Stephen Smith's near Guildford, where great persecution had been; and much goods had been taken away from friends for their meetings, and under great threatenings they were at that time; yet we had several blessed meetings there∣abouts; and the Lord's power was over all, in and by which we were preserved.</P>
<P>We went into Sussex, by Richard Baxe's, where we had a large, precious, quiet meeting, though the constables had given out threatenings before. I had many more meetings in that county; and though there were some threatenings, meetings were peaceable; and friends refreshed, and esta∣blished upon the foundation of God that stands sure. When I had thoroughly visited Sussex, I went into Kent, and had many glorious and precious meetings in several parts of that county. I went to a meeting near Deal, which was very large; and returning from thence to Can∣terbury, visited friends there; then passed into the Isle of Sheppy, where I staid two or three days: and thither came Alexander Parker, George Whitehead, and John Rouse.</P>
<P>The next day, finding my service for the Lord finished there, we passed towards Rochester. As I was walking
<PB N="120" REF="037441_0636_100D924756E023E0"/>down a hill, a great weight and oppression fell upon my spirit. I got on my horse again; but the weight remained so, that I was hardly able to ride. At length we came to Rochester, but I was much spent, being so extremely loaden and burden∣ed with the world's spirits, that my life was oppressed under them. I got with difficulty to Gravesend, and lay at an inn there; but could hardly either eat or sleep. The next day John Rouse and Alexander Parker went for London. John Stubbs and I went over the Ferry into Essex. We came to Horn-church, where was a meeting on the first-day. Af∣ter the meeting I rode with great uneasiness to Stratford, to a friend's whose name was Williams; he had formerly been a captain. Here I lay exceeding weak, and at last lost both hearing and sight. Several friends came to me from Lon∣don. I told them, <Q>I should be as a sign to such as would not see, and such as would not hear the truth.</Q> In this condition I continued a pretty while. Several came about me; and though I could not see their persons, I felt and discerned their spirits, who of them was honest-hearted, and who was not. Divers friends, who practised physick, would have given me medicines, but I was not to meddle with any; for I was sensible I had a travail to go through; and therefore desired none but solid, weighty friends might be about me. Under great sufferings, sorrows, and oppressions I lay for several weeks; whereby I was brought so low and weak in body, that few thought I could live. Some of those with me went away, saying, 'They would not see me die;' and it was reported both in London and in the country that I was deceased; but I felt the Lord's power inwardly supporting me. When those about me had given me up to die, I spoke to them to get a coach to carry me to Ger∣rard Roberts's, about twelve miles off; for I found it was my place to go thither. I had now recovered a little glim∣mering sight, so that I could discern the people and fields as I went, and that was all. When I came to Gerrard's, he was very weak. I was moved to speak to him, and en∣courage him. After I had staid about three weeks there, it was with me to go to Enfield. Friends were afraid of my removing; but I told them I might safely go. When I had taken my leave of Gerrard, and was come to Enfield, I went first to visit Amor Stoddart, who lay very weak, and almost speechless. I was moved to tell him, <Q>He had been faithful as a man, and faithful to God; and that the im∣mortal Seed of life was his crown.</Q> Many more words I
<PB N="121" REF="037441_0637_100D924948319860"/>was moved to speak to him; though I was then so weak, I was hardly able to stand; and within a few days after Amor died. I went to the widow Dry's at Enfield, where I lay all that winter; warring in spirit with the evil spirits of the world, that warred against truth and friends. For there were great persecutions at this time. Some meeting-houses were pulled down, and many were broken up by soldiers. Sometimes a troop of horse or a company of foot came; and some broke their swords, carbines, muskets, and pikes with beating friends. Many they wounded, so that their blood lay in the streets. Amongst others, that were active in this cruel persecution at London, my old adversary colonel Kir∣by was one; who, with a company of foot, went to break up several meetings; and would often inquire for me at the meetings he broke up. One time, as he went over the water to Horslydown, there happening some scuffle between some of his soldiers and some of the watermen, he bid his men 'Fire at them;' which they did, and killed some.</P>
<P>I was under great sufferings at this time, beyond what I have words to declare. For I was brought into the deep, and saw all the religions of the world, and people that lived in them, and the priests that held them up; who were as a company of men-eaters, eating up the people like bread, and gnawing the flesh from off their bones. But as for true religion and worship, and ministers of God, alack! I saw there was none amongst those of the world that pretended to it. For they that pretended to be the church, were but a company of men-eaters, men of cruel visages, and of long teeth; who, though they had cried against the men-eaters in America, I saw they were in the same nature. And as the great professing Jews did 'eat up God's people like bread,' and the false prophets and priests then preached peace to people, so long as they <Q>put into their mouths and fed them;</Q> but if they fed them not, they prepared war against them; <Q>they ate their flesh off their bones, and chopped them for the caldron;</Q> so these that profess themselves christians now (both priests and professors) and are not in the same power and Spirit that Christ and the holy prophets and apostles were in, are in the same nature that the old pro∣fessing Jews were in, and are men-eaters as well as they. These stirred up persecution, and set the wicked informers on work; so that a friend could hardly speak a few words in a private family, before they sat down to cat, but some
<PB N="122" REF="037441_0638_100D924AD86E0358"/>were ready to inform against them. A particular instance of which I have heard, as followeth:
At Droitwich, J. Cartwright came to a friend's house; and being moved of the Lord to speak a few words before he sat down to supper, there came an informer, and stood heark∣ening under the window. When he had heard the friend speak, hoping to get some gain to himself, he went and in∣formed; and go: a warrant to distrain the friend's goods, under pretence that there was a meeting at his house: whereas there was none in the house at that time but the friend, the man of the house, his wife, and their maid-ser∣vant. But this evil-minded man, as he came back with his warrant in the night, fell off his horse, and broke his neck. So there was a wretched end of a wicked informer, who hop∣ed to have enriched himself by spoiling friends; but the Lord prevented him, and cut him off in his wickedness.</P>
<P>Though it was a cruel, bloody, persecuting time, yet the Lord's power went over all, his everlasting Seed prevailed; and friends were made to stand firm and faithful in the Lord's power. Some sober people of other professions would say, <Q>If friends did not stand, the nation would run into de∣bauchery.</Q></P>
<P>Though by reason of my weakness I could not travel, amongst friends as I used to do; yet in the motion of life I sent the following lines, as an encouraging testimony to them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Seed is above all. In it walk; in which ye all have life. Be not amazed at the weather; for always the just suffered by the unjust, but the just had the domi∣nion. All along ye may see, by faith the mountains were subdued; and the rage of the wicked, with his fiery darts, were quenched. Though the waves and storms be high, yet your faith will keep you, so as to swim above them; for they are but for a time, and the truth is without time. Therefore keep on the mountain of holiness, ye who are led to it by the light, where nothing shall hurt. Do not think that any thing will outlast the truth, which standeth sure; and is over that which is out of the truth. For the good will overcome the evil, the light darkness, the life death, virtue vice, and righteousness unrighteousness. The false prophet cannot overcome the true; but the true
<PB N="123" REF="037441_0639_100D924C6913AFA0"/>prophet, Christ, will overcome all the false. So be faith∣ful, and live in that which doth not think the time long.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After some time it pleased the Lord to allay the heat of this violent persecution; and I felt in spirit an overcoming of the spirits of those men-eaters that had stirred it up, and carried it on to that height of cruelty, though I was out∣wardly very weak. I plainly felt, and those friends that were with me, and that came to visit me, took notice, that, as the persecution ceased, I came from under the travails and sufferings which had laid with such weight upon me: so that towards the spring I began to recover, and to walk up and down, beyond the expectation of many; who did not think I could ever have gone abroad again.</P>
<P>Whilst I was under this spiritual suffering, the state of the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, was opened to me; which some carnal-minded people had look∣ed upon to be like an outward city, dropped out of the elements. I saw the beauty and glory of it, the length, the breadth, and the height thereof, all in complete proportion. I saw that all, who are within the light of Christ, in his faith, which he is the author of, in the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, which Christ, the holy Prophets and Apostles were in, and within the grace, truth, and power of God, which are the walls of the city, such are within the city, are members of this city, and have right to eat of the tree of life, which yields her fruit every month, and whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves are for the healing of the nations. But they that are out of the grace, truth, light, Spirit and power of God, such as resist the Holy Ghost, quench, vex, and grieve the Spirit of God, who hate the Light, turn from the grace of God into wantonness, and do despite to the Spirit of Grace, such as have erred from the faith, made shipwreck of it and of a good conscience, who abuse the power of God, and despise prophesying, revelation, and inspiration, these are the dogs and unbelievers that are without the city. These make up the great city Babylon, confusion, and her cage, the power of darkness; and the evil spirit of error surrounds and covers them over. In this great city Babylon are the false prophets, in the false power and false spirit; the beast in the dragon's power, and the whore that is gone a whor∣ing from the Spirit of God, and nom Christ her husband. But the Lord's power is over all this power of darkness, cage,
<PB N="124" REF="037441_0640_100D924F7656A8E8"/>whore, beast, dragon, false prophets and their worshippers, who are for the lake which burns with fire. Many things more did I see concerning the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, which are hard to be uttered, and would be hard to be received. But, in short, this holy city is with∣in the light; and all that are within the light are within the city; the gates whereof stand open all the day (for there is no night there) that all may come in. Christ's blood being shed for every man, he tasted death for every man, and en∣lighteneth every man that cometh into the world; and his grace, that brings salvation, having appeared to all men, there is no place or language where his voice may not be heard. The christians in the primitive times were called by Christ 'A city set upon an hill;' they were also called 'The light of the world,' and, 'The salt of the earth;' but when christians lost the light, salt, and power of God, they came to be trodden under foot, like unsavoury salt. Even as the Jews, who while they kept the law of God were preserved above all nations, but when they turned their backs on God and his law they were trodden under foot of other nations; so Adam and Eve, while they obeyed God, were kept in his image and in the paradise of God, in dominion over all the works of his hands; but when they disobeyed God, they lost the image of God, the righte∣ousness and the holiness in which they were made; they lost their dominion, were driven out of paradise, fell under the dark power of Satan, and came under the chains of darkness. But the promise of God was, <Q>That the Seed of the woman. Christ Jesus, should bruise the serpent's head,</Q> should break his power and authority, which had led into captivity, and had held man therein. So Christ, who is the first and last, sets man free, and is the resurrec∣tion of the just and unjust, the Judge of quick and dead; and they that are in him are invested with everlasting rest and peace, out of all the labours, travails, and miseries of Adam in the fall. So he is sufficient and of ability to re∣store man up into the state that he was in before he fell; and not into that state only, but up into that state also that never fell, even to himself.</P>
<P>I had also in this time a great exercise and travail of spi∣rit upon me, concerning the powers and rulers of these na∣tions, from the sense I had of the many tender visitations and faithful warnings given them, and of their great abuse thereof, who had refused to hear, and rejected the counsel of
<PB N="125" REF="037441_0641_100D9251966AD4A0"/>the Lord. And though I knew friends would be clear of their blood, yet I could not but mourn over them, and give forth these few lines concerning them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>WE have given them a visitation, have faithfully warned them, have declared to them our inno∣cency and uprightness, and that we never did any hurt to the king, nor to any of his people. We have nothing in our hearts but love and good-will to him and his people, and desire their eternal welfare. But if they will not hear, the day of judgment, sorrow, torment, misery, and sud∣den destruction will come from the Lord upon them, that have been the cause of the sufferings of many thou∣sands of simple, innocent, harmless people, that have done them no hurt, nor have had any ill-will towards him or them; but have desired their eternal good, for the eternal truth's sake. Destruction will come upon them that turn the sword backward. Therefore do not blind your eyes, the Lord will bring swist destruction and misery upon you. Surely he will do it, and relieve his innocent peo∣ple, who have groaned for deliverance from under your oppression, and have also groaned for your deliverance out of wickedness. Blessed be the Lord God, that he hath a people in this nation that seek the good of all men upon the face of the earth; for we have the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ, that desires not the death of a sinner, but the salvation and good of all. Blessed be the name of the Lord our God for ever!</P>

<P>While I continued at Enfield, a sense came upon me of an hurt, that sometimes happened by persons coming under the profession of truth out of one country into another, to take an husband or wife amongst friends, where they were strangers, and it was not known whether they were clear and orderly or no. And it opened in me to recommend the following method to friends, for preventing such incon∣veniencies.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends that marry, whether men or women, if they come out of another nation, island, plantation, or county, let them bring a certificate from the men's meeting of that county, nation, island, or plantation from which they come, to the men's meeting where they pro∣pose
<PB N="126" REF="037441_0642_100D92532885FA48"/>their intention of marriage. For the men's meeting being made up of the faithful, this will stop all bad and raw spirits from roving up and down. When any come with a certificate or letter of recommendation from one men's meeting to another, one is refreshed by another, and can set their hands and hearts to the thing. This will prevent a great deal of trouble. And then, when ye have to say to them in the power of God, in admonishing and instructing them, ye are left to the power and Spirit of God to do it, and to let them know the duty of mar∣riage, and what it is; that there may be unity and con∣cord in the Spirit, and power, light, and wisdom of God, throughout all the men's meetings in the whole world, in one, in the life. Let copies of this be sent to every coun∣ty, nation, and island, where friends are, that all things may be kept holy, pure, and righteous, in unity and peace, and God over all may be glorified among you, his lot, his people, and inheritance, his adopted sons and daughters, and heirs of his life. So no more, but my love in that which changeth not.</P>

<P>When I had recovered, so that I could walk a little up and down, I went from Enfield to Gerrard Roberts's again, and from thence to the women's school at Shacklewell, and so to the meeting at Gracechurch-street, London; where, though I was yet but weak, the Lord's power upheld and enabled me to declare his eternal word of life.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to pray to the Lord, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O LORD God Almighty! prosper Truth, and pre∣serve justice and equity in the land! Bring down all injustice, iniquity, oppression, falsehood, cruelty, and unmercifulness in the land, that mercy and righteousness may flourish!</P>

Bring down in the land all debauchery, vice, whoredoms, fornication, and this raping spirit, which causeth and leadeth people to have no esteem of thee, O God! nor their own souls or bodies, nor of christianity, modesty, or humanity!</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="037441_0643_100D9254B8EEC4A0"/>
O Lord! put it in the magistrates hearts to bring down all this ungodliness, violence, cruelty, prophaneness, curs∣ing and swearing! and to put down all those whore-houses and play-houses, which corrupt youth and people, and lead them from thy kingdom, where no unclean thing can enter, neither shall come!

<P>I mentioned before, that, upon notice received of my wife's being had to prison again, I sent two of her daugh∣ters to the king, and they procured his order to the sheriff of Lancashire for her discharge. But though I expected she would have been set at liberty, yet this violent storm of persecution coming suddenly on, the persecutors there found means to hold her still in prison. But now the persecution a little ceasing, I was moved to speak to Martha Fisher, and another woman friend, to go to the king about her liberty. They went in the faith, and in the Lord's power; and he gave them favour with the king, so that he granted a discharge under the broad seal, to clear both her and her estate after she had been ten years a prisoner, and premu∣nired; the like whereof was scarce to be heard in England. I sent down the discharge forthwith by a friend; by whom also I wrote to her, to inform her how to get it delivered to the justices, and also to acquaint her, that it was upon me from the Lord to go beyond sea, to visit the plantations in America, and therefore desired her to hasten to London, as soon as she could conveniently after she had obtained her liberty, because the ship was then fitting for the voyage. In the meantime I got to Kingston, and staid at John Rous's till my wife came up, and then began to prepare for the voyage. But the yearly meeting being near at hand, I tarried till that was over. Many friends came up to it from all parts of the nation, and a very large and precious meet∣ing it was; for the Lord's power was over all, and his glo∣rious, everlastingly-renowned seed of life was exalted above all.</P>
<P>After this meeting was over, and I had finished my ser∣vices for the Lord in England, the ship, and the friends that
<PB N="128" REF="037441_0644_100D925657B48EC8"/>intended to go with me, being ready, I went to Gravesend the 12th of the 6th month. The friends that were bound for the voyage with me went down to the ship the night before. Their names were, Thomas Briggs, William Ed∣mundson, John Rouse, John Stubbs, Solomon Eccles, James Lancaster, John Cartwright, Robert Widders, George Pattison, John Hull, Elizabeth Hooton, and Elizabeth Mi∣ers. The vessel we were to go in was a yacht, called the Industry, the master's name Thomas Forster, and the num∣ber of passengers about fifty. I lay that night on board; but most of the friends lay at Gravesend. Early next morning, the passengers, and those friends that intended to accompany us to the Downs, being come on board, we took our leave in great tenderness of those that came with us to Gravesend only, and set sail about six in the morning for the Downs. Having a fair wind, we outsailed all the ships that were outward-bound, and got thither by the even∣ing. Some of us went ashore that night, and lodged at Deal; where we understood an officer had orders from the governor to take our names in writing, which he did the next morning, though we told him they had been taken at Gravesend. In the afternoon, the wind serving, I took leave of my wife and the other friends, and went on board. Before we could set sail, there being two of the king's fri∣gates riding in the Downs, the captain of one of them sent his press-master on board us, who took three of our seamen. This had certainly delayed, if not wholly prevented our voyage, had not the captain of the other frigate, being in∣formed of the leakiness of our vessel, and the length of our voyage, in compassion and much civility, spared us two of his men. Before this was over, an officer of the custom∣house came on board to peruse packets and get fees, so that we were kept from sailing till about sun-set; during which stop, a very considerable number of merchantmen, outward∣bound, were got several leagues before us. Being clear we set sail in the evening, and by next morning overtook part of that fleet about the height of Dover. We soon reached the rest, and in a little time left them all behind us; for our yatch was counted a very swift sailer. But she was very leaky, so that the seamen and some of the passengers did for the most part pump day and night. One day they observed that in two hours time she sucked in sixteen inches of water in the well.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="037441_0645_100D92597A1FB708"/>
When we had been about three weeks at sea, one after∣noon we spied a vessel about four leagues astern of us. Our master said, It was a Sallee man of war who seemed to give us chace. Our master said, <Q>Come, let us go to supper, and when it grows dark, we shall lose him.</Q> This he spoke to pacify the passengers, some of whom began to be very apprehensive of the danger. But friends were well sa∣tisfied, having faith in God, and no fear upon their spirits. When the sun was down, I saw the ship out of my cabin making towards us. When it grew dark, we altered our course to miss her; but she altered also, and gained upon us. At night the master and others came into my cabin, and asked me, 'What they should do?' I told them, <Q>I was no mariner;</Q> and asked them, <Q>What they thought was best to do?</Q> They said, <Q>There were but two ways, either to out-run him, or tack about and hold the same course we were going before.</Q> I told them, <Q>If he were a thief, they might be sure he would tack about too; and as for out-running him, it was to no purpose to talk of that, for they saw he sailed faster than we.</Q> They asked me again, 'What they should do?' 'For,' they said, <Q>if the mariners had taken Paul's counsel, they had not come to the damage they did.</Q> I answered, <Q>It was a tria of faith, therefore the Lord was to be waited on for counsel.</Q> So retiring in spirit, the Lord shewed me, <Q>That his life and power was placed between us and the ship that pursued us.</Q> I told this to the master and the rest, and that the best way was to tack about and steer our right course. I wished them also to put out all their candles, but that they steered by, and to speak to all the passengers to be still and quiet. About the 11th hour in the night the watch called, and said, 'They were just upon us.' That disquieted some of the passengers; whereupon I sat up in my cabin, and looking through the port-hole, the moon being not quite down, I saw them very near us. I was getting up to go out of the cabin; but remembering the word of the Lord, 'That his life and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er was placed between us and them,' I lay down again. The master and some of the seamen came again, and asked me, <Q>If they might not steer such a point?</Q> I told them, 'They might do as they would.' By this time the moon was gone quite down, a fresh gale arose, and the Lord hid us from them; and we sailed briskly on, and saw them no more. The next day, being the first day of the week, we had a publick meeting in the ship, as
<PB N="130" REF="037441_0646_100D925B0D9ABA20"/>we usually had on that day throughout the voyage, and the Lord's presence was greatly among us. I desired the peo∣ple, <Q>To mind the mercies of the Lord, who had delivered them; for they might have been all in the Turks hands by that time, had not the Lord's hand saved them.</Q> About a week after, the master and some of the seamen endeavoured to persuade the passengers, it was not a Turkish pirate that chased us, but a merchant-man going to the Canaries. When I heard of it, I asked them, <Q>Why then did they speak so to me? Why did they trouble the passengers? And why did they tack about from him, and alter their course?</Q> I told them, <Q>They should take heed of slight∣ing the mercies of God.</Q></P>
<P>Afterwards, while we were at Barbadoes, came in a mer∣chant from Sallee, and told the people, <Q>That one of the Sallee men of war saw a monstrous yacht at sea, the greatest that ever he saw, had her in chace, and was just upon her; but there was a Spirit in her that he could not take.</Q> This confirmed us in the belief, that it was a Sallee-man we saw make after us; and that it was the Lord that delivered us out of his hands.</P>
<P>I was not sea-sick during the voyage, as many of the friends and other passengers were; but the many hurts and bruises I had formerly received, and the infirmities I had contracted in England by extreme cold and hardships, that I had un∣dergone in many long and sore imprisonments, returned upon me at sea; so that I was very ill in my stomach, and full of violem pains in my bones and limbs. This was after I had been at sea about a month; for about three weeks after I came first to sea, I sweat abundantly, chiefly my head; and my body broke out in pimples, and my legs and feet swelled extremely, so that my stockings and slippers could not be drawn on without difficulty and great pain. On a sudden the sweating ceased, so that when I came into the hot climate, where others sweat most freely, I could not sweat at all; but my flesh was hot, dry, and burning, and that which before broke out in pimples struck in again to my stomach and heart; so that I was very ill, and weak beyond expression. Thus I continued during the rest of the voyage, which was about a month; for we were seven weeks and some odd days at sea.</P>
<P>The third of the eighth month, early in the morning, we discovered the island of Barbadoes; but it was between nine and ten at night ere we came to anchor in Carlisle-bay. We
<PB N="131" REF="037441_0647_100D925CFABB4358"/>got on shore as soon as we could, and I with some others walked to a friend's house, a merchant, whose name was Richard Forstall, above a quarter of a mile from the bridge. But being very ill and weak, I was so tired, that I was in a manner spent by that time I got thither. There I abode very ill several days, and though they several times gave me things to make me sweat, they could not effect it. What they gave me did rather parch and dry up my body, and made me probably worse than otherwise I might have been. Thus I continued about three weeks after I landed, having much pain in my bones, joints, and whole body, so that I could hardly get any rest; yet I was pretty cheary, and my spirit kept above it all. Neither did my illness take me off from the service of truth; but both while I was at sea, and after I came to Barbadoes, before I was able to travel about, I gave forth several papers (having a friend to write for me) some of which I sent by the first conveyance for England to be printed.</P>
<P>After I had rested three or four days at Richard For∣stall's, where many friends came to visit me, John Rous, having borrowed a coach of colonel Chamberlain, came to fetch me to his father Thomas Rous's. But it was late ere we could get thither, and little or no rest could I take that night. A few days after, colonel Chamberlain, who had so kindly lent his coach, came to give me a visit, and car∣ried himself very courteously towards me.</P>
<P>Soon after I came into the island, I was informed of a remarkable passage, wherein the justice of God did emi∣nently appear: It was thus. There was a young man of Barbadoes, whose name was John Drakes (a person of some note in the world's account, but a common swearer and a bad man) who, when he was in London, had a mind to marry a friend's daughter, left by her mother very young, with a considerable portion, to the care and government of several friends, whereof I was one. He made application to me, that he might have my consent to marry this young maid. I told him, <Q>I was one of her overseers appointed by her mother, who was a widow, to take care of her; that if her mother had intended her for a match to any man of another profession, she would have disposed her accordingly; but she committed her to us, that she might be trained up in the fear of the Lord; and therefore I should betray the trust reposed in me, if I should consent that he, who was out of the fear of God, should marry
<PB N="132" REF="037441_0648_100D925F318D5938"/>her; which I would not do.</Q> When he saw that he could not obtain his desire, he returned to Barbadoes with great offence of mind against me, but without a just cause. After∣wards, when he heard I was coming to Barbadoes, he swore desperately, and threatened, <Q>if he could possibly procure it, he would have me burned to death when I came there.</Q> Which a friend hearing, asked him, <Q>What I had done to him, that he was so violent against me?</Q> He would not answer, but said again, 'I'll have him burned.' Where∣upon the friend replied, <Q>Do not march on too furiously, left thou come too soon to thy journey's end.</Q> About ten days after, he was struck with a violent burning fever, of which he died; by which his body was so scorched, that the people said, 'It was as black as a coal; and three days before I landed, his body was laid in the dust. This was taken notice of as a sad example.</P>
<P>While I continued so weak that I could not go abroad to meetings, the other friends that came over with me bestirred themselves in the Lord's work. The next day but one after we came on shore, they had a great meeting at the Bridge, and after that several meetings in different parts of the island; which alarmed the people of all sorts, so that many came to our meetings, and some of the chiefest rank. For they had got my name, understanding I was come upon the island, and expected to have seen me, not knowing I was unable to go abroad. And indeed my weakness continued the lon∣ger on me, by reason that my spirit was much pressed down at the first with the filth and dirt, the unrighteousness of the people, which lay as an heavy weight and load upon me. But after I had been above a month upon the island, my spirit became somewhat easier, I began to recover my health and strength, and get abroad among friends. In the meantime, having an opportunity to send to England, I wrote to friends there, to let them know how it was with me.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been very weak these seven weeks past, and not able to write myself. My desire is to you, and for you all, that ye may live in the fear of God, and in love one unto another, and be subject one to another in the fear of God. I have been weaker in my body than ever I was in my life that I remember, yea, my pains have been such as I cannot express; yet my heart and spirit are strong. I have hardly sweated these seven weeks past,
<PB N="133" REF="037441_0649_100D9261220DBA48"/>though I am in a very hot climate, where hardly any but are well nigh continually sweating; but as for me, my old bruises, colds, numbness, and pains struck inwardly, even to my very heart. So that little rest I have taken, and the chiefest things that were comfortable to my stomach were a little water and powdered ginger; but now I begin to drink a little beer as well as water, and sometimes a lit∣tle wine and water mixed. Great pains and travails I have felt, and in measure am under; but it is well, my life is over all. This island was to me as all on a fire ere I came to it, but now it is somewhat quenched and abated. I came in weakness amongst those that are strong, and have so continued; but now I am got a little cheary, and over it. Many friends, and some considerable persons of the world, have been with me. I tired out my body much when amongst you in England; it is the Lord's power that helps me; therefore I desire you all to prize the power of the Lord and his truth. I was but weak in body when I left you, after I had been in my great travail amongst you; but after that it struck all back again into my body, which was not well settled after such sore travails in En∣gland. Then I was so tired at sea, that I could not rest, and have had little or no stomach a long time. Since I came into the island, my life hath been very much bur∣dened; but I hope, if the Lord gives me strength to ma∣nage his work, I shall work thoroughly, and bring things that have been out of course into better order. So, dear friends, live all in the peaceable truth, and in the love of it, serving the Lord in newness of life; for glorious things and precious truths have been manifested among you plen∣tifully, to you the riches of the kingdom have been reach∣ed. I have been almost a month in this island, but have not been able to go abroad or ride out; only very lately I rode out twice, a quarter of a mile at a time, which wea∣ried me much. My love in the truth is to you all.</P>

<P>Because I was not well able to travel, the friends of the island concluded to have their men's and women's meeting for the service of the church at Thomas Rous's, where I lay; by which means I was present at each of their meet∣ings, and had very good service for the Lord in both. For they had need of information in many things, divers disor∣ders being crept in for want of care and watchfulness. <Q>I
<PB N="134" REF="037441_0650_100D926348D75610"/>exhorted them, more especially at the men's meeting, to be careful with respect to marriages, to prevent friends marrying in near kindreds, and also to prevent over-hasty proceedings towards second marriages after the death of a former husband or wife; advising that a decent regard be had in such cases to the memory of the deceased husband or wife. As to friends children marrying too young, at thirteen or fourteen years of age, I shewed the unfitness thereof, and the inconveniencies and hurts that attend such, childish marriages. I admonished them to purge the floor thoroughly, and to sweep their houses very clean, that nothing might remain that would defile; and that all should take care, that nothing be spoken out of their meet∣ings to the blemishing or defaming one of another. Concern∣ing registering of marriages, births, and burials, I advised them to keep exact records of each in distinct books for that only use; and also to record in a book for that pur∣pose, the condemnations of such as went out from truth into disorderly practices, and the repentance and restora∣tion of such as returned again. I recommended to their care the providing of convenient burying-places for friends, which in some parts were yet wanting. Some directions also I gave them concerning wills, and the ordering of le∣gacies left by friends for publick uses, and other things re∣lating to the affairs of the church. Respecting their ne∣groes, I desired them to endeavour to train them up in the fear of God, as well those that were bought with their money, as them that were born in their families, that all might come to the knowledge of the Lord; that so, with Joshua, every master of a family might say, <Q>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</Q> I desired also, that they would cause their overseers to deal mildly and gently with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>groes, and not use cruelty towards them, as the manner of some hath been and is; and that after certain years of servitude they should make them free.</Q> Many sweet and precious things were opened in these meet∣ings, by the Spirit and in the power of the Lord, to the edifying, confirming, and building up of friends in the faith and holy order of the gospel.</P>
<P>After these meetings, the vessel bound for England not being gone. I was moved to write another epistle to friends there; the copy whereof follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="135" REF="037441_0651_100D9265397296B8"/>
<P>DEAR friends and brethren, to whom is my love in that which never changeth, but remains in glory, which is over all, the top and corner-stone. In this all have peace and life, as ye dwell in the blessed seed, where∣in all is blessed, over that which brought the curse; where all shortness, narrowness of spirit, brittleness, and peevish∣ness is. Therefore keep the holy order of the gospel. Keep in this blessed seed, where all may be kept in tem∣perance, in patience, in love, in meekness, in righteous∣ness and holiness, and in peace; in which the Lord may be seen amongst you, and no way dishonoured, but glorified by you all. In all your meetings, in cities, towns, and countries, men's meetings, women's meetings, and others, let righteousness flow among you, the holy truth be up∣permost, the pure Spirit your guide and leader, and the holy wisdom from above your orderer, that is pure, gentle, and easy to be intreated. Keep in the religion that pre∣serves from the spots of the world, which is pure and un∣defiled in God's sight. Keep in the pure and holy wor∣ship, in which the pure and holy God is worshipped, viz. in the Spirit, and in the truth, which the devil is out of, who is the author of all unholiness, and of that which dis∣honours God. Be tender of God's glory, of his honour, and of his blessed and holy name, in which ye are gathered. All who profess the truth, see that ye walk in it, in right∣eousness, holiness, and godliness; for <Q>holiness becomes the house of God, the household of faith.</Q> That which becomes God's house, God loves. He loves righteous∣ness. That is the ornament which becomes his house and all his family. Therefore see that righteousness run down in all your assemblies, that it flow, to drive away all un∣righteousness. This preserves your peace with God; for in righteousness ye all have peace with the righteous God of peace, and one with another. Every one that bears the name of the Anointed, that high title of being a Christian, named after the Heavenly Man, see that ye be in the di∣vine nature made conformable unto his image, even the image of the Heavenly Divine Man, who was before that image which Adam and Eve got from Satan in the fall so that in none of you that fallen image may appear, but his image, and you made conformable unto him. Here translation is shewed forth in life and conversation, not in words only; yea, and conversion and repentance, which is a change of the nature, of the mind, and of the heart,
<PB N="136" REF="037441_0652_100D92672E064D88"/>of the spirit and affections, which have been below, and come to be set above; and so receive the things that are from above, and have the conversation in heaven, not that conversation which is according to the power of the prince of the air, that now rules in the disobedient. So be faith∣ful; this is the word of the Lord God unto you all. See, that godliness, holiness, righteousness, truth, and virtue, the fruits of the good Spirit, flow over the bad and its fruits, that ye may answer that which is of God in all; for your Heavenly Father is glorified, in that you bring forth much fruit. Therefore ye, who are plants of his planting, his trees of righteousness, see that every tree be full of fruit. Keep in true humility, and in the true love of God, which doth edify his body, that the true nourish∣ment from the head, the refreshings, springs, and rivers of water, and bread of life may be plenteously known and felt amongst you, that so praises may ascend to God. Be faithful to the Lord God, and just and true in all your dealings and doings with and towards men. Be not negli∣gent in your men's meetings to admonish, exhort, and re∣prove, in the spirit of love and of meekness, and to seek that which is lost, and to bring back again that which hath been driven away. Let all minds, spirits, souls, and hearts, be bended down under the yoke of Christ Jesus, the power of God. Much I could write, but am weak, and have been mostly since I left you. Burdens and tra∣vails I have been under, and gone through many ways; but it is well. The Lord Almighty knows my work, which he hath sent me forth to do by his everlasting arm and power, which is from everlasting to everlasting. Bles∣sed be his holy name, which I am in, and in which my love is to you all.</P>

<P>After I was able to go abroad, and had been a little amongst friends, I went to visit the governor; Lewis Mor∣rice, Thomas Rouse, and some other friends being with me. He received us very civilly, and treated us very kindly; making us dine with him, and keeping us most part of the day before he let us go away.</P>
<P>The same week I went to Bridge Town. There was to be a general meeting of friends that week; and the visit I had made to the governor, and the kind reception I had with him, being generally known to the officers, civil and
<PB N="137" REF="037441_0653_100D92692187EC60"/>military, many came to this meeting from most parts of the island, and those not of the meanest rank; divers of them being judges or justices, colonels or captains; so that a very great meeting we had of friends and others. The Lord's blessed power was plentifully with us, and though I was somewhat straitened for time, three other friends having spoken before me, the Lord opened things through me to the general and great satisfaction of those present. Colonel Lewis Morrice came to this meeting, and with him a judge in the country, whose name was Ralph Fretwell; who was well satisfied, and received the truth.</P>
<P>Paul Gwin, a jangling Baptist, came into the meeting, and asked me, <Q>How I spelt Cain? and whether I had the same spirit as the apostles had?</Q> I told him, Yes. And he bade the judge take notice of it. I told him, <Q>He that had not a measure of the same Holy Ghost as the apostles had, was possessed with an unclean spirit.</Q> And then he went his way.</P>
<P>I went home with Lewis Morrice that night, being about nine or ten miles; going part of the way by boat, the rest on horseback. The place where his plantation was I thought to be the finest air of the island. Next day Thomas Briggs and William Edmundson came to see me, they intending to leave the island the day following, and to go upon the Lord's service to Antigua and Nevis. Lewis Morrice went with them. At Antigua they had several good meetings, to which there was a great resort of people; and many were convinced. But when they went to Nevis, the governor, an old persecutor, sent soldiers on board the vessel, to stop them, and would not suffer them to land. Wherefore, after friends of the place had been on board the vessel with them, and they had been sweetly refreshed together, in feeling the Lord's power and presence amongst them, they returned to Antigua; where having staid awhile longer, they came again to Barbadoes; Thomas Briggs being very weak and ill.</P>
<P>Of the other friends that came over with me, James Lan∣caster, John Cartwright, and George Pattison, were gone some time before to Jamaica, and others to other places; so that few remained in Barbadoes with me. We had ma∣ny great and precious meetings, both for worship, and for the affairs of the church; to the former of which many of other societies came. At one of these meetings, colonel Lyne, a sober person, was so well satisfied with what I de∣clared
<PB N="138" REF="037441_0654_100D926B1CA11DE8"/>that he said, <Q>Now I can gainsay such as I have heard speak evil of you; who say you do not own Christ, nor that he died: whereas I perceive you exalt Christ in all his offices, beyond what I have ever heard before.</Q> This man, observing one to take in writing the heads of what I delivered, desired him so let him have a copy of it; and said another day with us before he went away; so great a love was raised in him to the truth. A very great convince∣ment there was in most parts of the island; which made the priest and some professors fret and rage. Our meetings were very large, and free from disturbance from the govern∣ment; though the envious priests and some professors en∣deavoured to stir up the magistrates against us. When they found they could not prevail that way, some Baptists came to the meeting at the town, which was full of people of se∣veral ranks and qualities. A great company came with them; and they brought a slanderous paper written by John Pennyman with which they made a great noise. But the Lord gave me wisdom and utterance to answer their cavils; so that the auditory generally received satisfac∣tion, and those quarrelsome professors lost ground. When they had wearied themselves with clamour, they went away; but the people staying, the meeting was continued; the things they cavilled about were further opened and cleared, and the life and power of God came over all. But the rage and envy in our adversaries did not cease; they endea∣voured to defame friends with many false and scandalous reports, which they spread through the island. Whereupon I, with some other friends, drew up a paper, to go forth in the name of the people called Quakers, for the clearing truth and friends from those false reports. It was after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>For the governor of Barbadoes, with his council and assembly and all others in power, both civil and mi∣litary, in this island; from the people called Quakers.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS many scandalous lies and slanders have been cast upon us, to render us odious; as that "We deny God. Christ Jesus, and the scriptures of truth." &amp;c. This is to inform you, That all our books and de∣claractions, which for these many years have been publish∣ed to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, clearly testify the contrary. Yet for your satisfaction, we now p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mly and sincerely declare,
<PB N="139" REF="037441_0655_100D926CAB478760"/>That we own and believe in the only Wise, Omnipotent, and Everlasting God, the Creator of all things in heaven and earth, and the Preserver of all that he hath made; who is God over all, blessed for ever; to whom be all honour, glory, dominion, praise and thanksgiving, both now and for evermore! And we own and believe in Jesus Christ, his beloved and only begotten Son, in whom he is well pleased; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary; in whom we have redemp∣tion through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins; who is the express image of the Invisible God, the first-born of every creature, by whom were all things created that are in heaven and in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers; all things were created by him. And we own and believe that he was made a sacrifice for sin, who knew no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; that he was cruci∣fied for us in the flesh, without the gates of Jerusalem; and that he was buried, and rose again the third day by the power of his Father, for our justification; and that he ascended up into heaven, and now sitteth at the right hand of God. This Jesus, who was the foundation of the holy prophets and apostles, is our foundation; and we be∣lieve there is no other foundation to be laid but that which is laid, even Christ Jesus: who tasted death for every man, shed his blood for all men, is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world: according as John the Baptist testified of him, when he said, <Q>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world,</Q> John i. 29. We believe that he alone is our Redeemer and Saviour, the captain of our salvation, who saves us from sin, as well as from hell and the wrath to come, and destroys the devil and his works; he is the Seed of the woman that bruises the serpent's head, to wit, Christ Jesus, the Alpha and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the First and the Last. He is (as the scriptures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say of him) our wisdom, righteousness, justification, and redemption; nei∣ther is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we may be saved. He alone is the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls: he is our Prophet, whom Moses long since testifi∣ed of, saying, <Q>A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you:
<PB N="140" REF="037441_0656_100D926F8CBC6BF8"/>and it shall come to pass, that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the peo∣ple,</Q> Acts ii. 22, 23. He is now come in Spirit, <Q>and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true.</Q> He rules in our hearts by his law of love and life, and makes us free from the law of sin and death. We have no life, but by him; for he is the quickening Spirit, the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, by whose blood we are cleansed, and our consciences sprinkled from dead works, to serve the living God. He is our Media∣tor, who makes peace and reconciliation between God offended and us offending; he being the Oath of God, the new covenant of light, life, grace, and peace, the au∣thor and finisher of our faith. This Lord Jesus Christ, the heavenly man, the Emanuel, God with us, we all own and believe in; he whom the high-priest raged against, and said, he had spoken blasphemy; whom the priests and elders of the Jews took counsel together against, and put to death; the same whom Judas betrayed for thirty pieces of silver, which the priests gave him as a reward for his treason; who also gave large money to the soldiers to broach an horrible lie, namely, <Q>That his disciples came and stole him away by night whilst they slept.</Q> After he was risen from the dead, the history of the Acts of the apostles sets forth how the chief priests and elders perse∣cuted the disciples of this Jesus, for preaching Christ and his resurrection. This, we say, is that Lord Jesus Christ, whom we own to be our life and salvation.</P>
<P>Concerning the holy scriptures, we believe they were given forth by the holy Spirit of God, through the holy men of God, who (as the scripture itself declares, 2 Pet. i. 21.) "spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." We believe they are to be read, believed, and fulfilled (he that fulfils them is Christ); and they are <Q>profitable for re∣proof, for correction and for instruction in righteousness, that the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>d may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works,</Q> 2 Tim. 3. 19. and are able to "make wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus." We believe the holy scriptures are the words of God; for it is said in Exodes 20. 1. <Q>God spake all these words, saying,</Q> &amp;c. meaning the ten commandments given forth upon mount Sinai. And in Rev. xxii. 18. saith John, <Q>I testify to every man that heareth the words of the pro∣phecy of this book, if any man addeth unto these, and if
<PB N="141" REF="037441_0657_100D9271956F2EC0"/>any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy</Q> (not the Word) &amp;c. So in Luke 1. 20. "Because thou believest not my words." And in John v. 47. xv. 7. xiv. 23. xii. 47. So that we call the holy scriptures, as Christ, the apostles, and holy men of God called them, viz. the words of God.</P>
<P>Another slander they have cast upon us, is, <Q>That we teach the negroes to rebel:</Q> a thing we utterly abhor in our hearts, the Lord knows it, who is the searcher of all hearts, and knows all things, and can testify for us, that this is a most abominable untruth. That which we have spoken to them, is To exhort and admonish them to be sober, to fear God, to love their masters and mistresses, to be faithful and diligent in their service and business, and then their masters and overseers would love them, and deal kindly and gently with them; also that they should not beat their wives, nor the wives their husbands; neither should the men have many wives; that they should not steal, nor be drunk, nor commit adultery, nor fornication, nor curse, swear, nor lie, nor give bad words to one ano∣ther, nor to any one else; for there is something in them that tells them they should not practise these nor any other evils. But if they notwithstanding should do them, then we let them know there are but two ways, the one that leads to heaven, where the righteous go; and the other that leads to hell, where the wicked and debauched, whoremongers, adulterers, murderers, and liars go. To the one the Lord will say, <Q>Come, ye blessed of my Fa∣ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</Q> to the other, <Q>Depart, ye curs∣ed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</Q> so the wicked go into <Q>everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal,</Q> Mat. xxv. Consider, friends, it is no transgression for a master of a family to in∣struct his family himself, or for others to do it in his be∣half; but rather it is a very great duty incumbent upon them. Abraham and Joshua did so: of the first, the Lord said, Gen. xviii. 19. <Q>I know that Abraham will command his children, and his household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham the things that he hath spoken of him.</Q> And the latter said, Josh. xxiv. 15. <Q>Choose ye this day whom ye will serve —But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</Q>
<PB N="142" REF="037441_0658_100D9273233E3B68"/>We declare, that we esteem it a duty incumbent on us to pray with and for, to teach, instruct, and admonish those in and belonging to our families; this being a command of the Lord, disobedience thereunto will provoke his dis∣pleasure; as may be seen in Jer. x. 25. <Q>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon thy name.</Q> Negroes, Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nies, Indians, make up a very great part of the families in this island; for whom an account will be required by him who comes to judge both quick and dead at the great day of judgment, when every one shall be <Q>rewarded accord∣ing to the deeds done in the body, whether they be good, or whether they be evil:</Q> at that day, we say, of the resur∣rection both of the good and of the bad, and of the just and the unjust, when <Q>the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that be∣lieve in that day,</Q> 2 Thess. i. 8, &amp;c. See also 2 Pet. iii. 3, &amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This wicked slander (of our endeavouring to make the Negroes rebel) our adversaries took occasion to raise, from our having some meetings amongst the Negroes; for we had several meetings with them in divers plantations, where∣in we exhorted them to justice, sobriety, temperance, cha∣stity, and piety, and to be subject to their masters and governors. Which was altogether contrary to what our envious adversaries maliciously suggested against us.</P>
<P>As I had been to visit the governor, as soon as I was well able, after I came thither; so when I was at Thomas Rouse's, the governor came to see me, carrying himself very courteously.</P>
<P>Having been three months or more in Barbadoes, and having visited friends, thoroughly settled meetings, and dis∣patched the service for which the Lord brought me thither; I felt my spirit clear of that island, and found drawings to Jamaica. Which when I had communicated to friends, I acquainted the governor also, and divers of his council, with my intention; which I did, that as my coming thither was open and publick, so my departure also might be. Be∣fore

<P>I set sail from Barbadoes to Jamaica the eighth of the eleventh month, 1671, Robert Widders, William Edmund∣son, Solomon Eccles, and Elizabeth Hooton going with me. Thomas Briggs and John Stubbs remained in Barba∣does; with whom were John Rouse and William Baily. We had a quick and easy passage to Jamaica; where we met with James Lancaster, John Cartwright, and George Pattison again, who had been labouring there in the service of truth; into which we forthwith entered with them, tra∣velling up and down through the island, which is large; and a brave country it is, though the people are many of them debauched and wicked. We had much service. There was a great convincement, and many received the truth; some of which were people of account in the world. We had many meetings there, which were large, and very quiet. The people were civil to us, so that not a mouth was opened against us. I was twice with the governor, and some other magistrates, who all carried themselves kindly towards me.</P>
<P>About a week after we landed in Jamaica, Elizabeth Hooton, a woman of great age, who had travelled much in truth's service, and suffered much for it, departed this life.
<PB N="144" REF="037441_0660_100D9277220A9D68"/>She was well the day before she died; and departed in peace, like a lamb, bearing testimony to truth at her departure.</P>

<P>TO whom is my love, and to the children, in that which changeth not, but is over all; and to all friends in those parts. I have been at Jamaica about five weeks. Friends are generally well; and here is a con∣vincement; but things would be too large to write of. Sufferings in every place attend me; but the blessed Seed is over all: the great Lord be praised, who is Lord of sea and land, and of all things therein. We intend to pass from hence about the beginning of the next month, to∣wards Maryland, if the Lord please. Dwell all of you in the Seed of God. In his truth I rest in love to you all.</P>

<P>We went on board the 8th of the first month 1671-2; and having contrary winds, were a full week sailing for∣wards and backwards, before we could get out of sight of Jamaica. A difficult voyage this proved, and pretty dan∣gerous, especially in our passing through the gulph of Flo∣rida, where we met with many winds and storms. But the great God, who is Lord of sea and land, and who rideth upon the wings of the wind, did by his power preserve us through many and great dangers, when by extreme stress of weather our vessel was divers times like to be overset, and much of her tackling broken. And indeed we were sensible that the Lord was a God at hand, and that his ear was open to the supplications of his people. For when the winds were so strong and boisterous, and the storms and tempests so great, that the sailors knew not what to do, but let the ship go which way she would; then did we pray unto the Lord; who did graciously hear and accept us, and did
<PB N="145" REF="037441_0661_100D9279784F0A00"/>calm the winds and seas, gave us seasonable weather, and made us to rejoice in his salvation; blessed and praised be the holy name of the Lord, whose power hath dominion over all, and whom the winds and seas obey!</P>
<P>We were between six and seven weeks in this passage from Jamaica to Maryland. Some days before we came to land, after we had entered the bay of Patuxent river, a great storm arose, which cast a boat upon us for shelter; in which were divers men and women of account in the world. We took them in; but the boat was lost, with five hundred pounds worth of goods in it, as they said. They continued on board us several days, not having any means to get off; and we had a very good meeting with them in the ship. But provisions grew short, for they brought none in with them; and ours, by reason of the length of our voyage, were well nigh spent when they came to us: so that with their living upon it too, we had now little or none left. Whereupon George Pattison took a boat, and ventured his life to get to shore; the hazard was so great, that all but friends concluded he would be cast away. Yet it pleased the Lord to bring him safe to land; and in a short time af∣ter the friends of the place came to fetch us to land also, in a seasonable time, for our provisions were quite spent.</P>
<P>We partook also of another great deliverance in this voy∣age, through the good providence of the Lord, which we understood afterwards. When we were determined to come from Jamaica, we had our choice of two vessels, both bound for the same coast. One was a frigate, the other a yacht. The master of the frigate, we thought, asked unreasonably for our passage; which made us agree with the master of the yacht, who offered to carry us ten shillings a piece cheaper than the other. We went on board the yacht, and the fri∣gate came out together with us, intending to be consorts during the voyage; and for several days we sailed together: but what with calms and contrary winds, we were in awhile separated. After which, the frigate, losing her way, fell among the Spaniards; by whom she was plundered and robbed, and the master and mate made prisoners; after∣wards, being retaken by the English, she was sent home to her owners in Virginia, Which when we came to under∣stand, we saw and admired the Providence of God, who preserved us out of our enemies hands; and he that was covetous fell among the covetous.</P>
<P>Here we found Burneyate, intending shortly to sail for
<PB N="146" REF="037441_0662_100D927B0D84A9B0"/>Old England; but upon our arrival he altered his purpose, and joined us in the Lord's service. He had appointed a general meeting for all the friends in the province of Mary∣land, that he might see them together, and take his leave of them, before he departed out of the country; and it was so ordered by the good providence of God, that we landed just time enough to reach that meeting; by which means we had a very seasonable opportunity of taking the friends of the province together. A very large meeting this was, and held four days; to which, besides friends, came many other people, divers of whom were of considerable quality in the world's account: for there were five or six justices of the peace, the speaker of their assembly, one of their coun∣cil, and others of note, who seemed well satisfied with the meeting. After the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's meetings began; wherein I opened to friends the sevice thereof, to their great satisfaction. After this we went to the Cliffs, where another general meeting was ap∣pointed. We went some of the way by land, the rest by water; and a storm arising, our boat was run aground, in danger to be beaten to pieces, and the water came in upon us. I was in a great sweat, having come very hot out of a meeting before, and now was wet with the water besides: yet having faith in the divine power, I was preserved from taking hurt, blessed be the Lord! To this meeting many came, who received the truth with reverence. We had also a men's meeting and a women's meeting. Most of the backsliders came in again; and several of those meetings were established for taking care of the affairs of the church.</P>
<P>After these two general meetings, we parted company, dividing ourselves unto several coasts, for the service of truth. James Lancaster and John Cartwright went by sea for New-England; William Edmundson and three friends more sailed for Virginia, where things were much out of order; John Burnyeate, Robert Widders. George Pattison, and I, with several friends of the province, went over by boat to the eastern shore, and had a meeting there on the first-day; where many people received the truth with glad∣ness, and friends were greatly refreshed. A very large and heavenly meeting it was. Several persons of quality in that country were at it, two of whom were justices of the peace. It was upon me from the Lord to send to the In∣dian emperor and his kings, to come to that meeting; the emperor came, and was at the meeting; but his kings, lying
<PB N="147" REF="037441_0663_100D927D52A84A78"/>further off, could not reach thither time enough; yet they came after with their cockarooses. I had in the evening two good opportunities with them; they heard the word of the Lord willingly, and confessed to it. <Q>What I spoke to them. I desired them to speak to their people; and let them know, that God was raising up his tabernacle of witness in their wilderness-country, and was setting up his standard and glorious ensign of righteousness.</Q> They car∣ried themselves very courteously and lovingly; and in∣quired, <Q>Where the next meeting would be, and they would come to it.</Q> Yet they said, <Q>They had a great debate with their council about their coming, before they came now.</Q></P>
<P>The next day we began our journey by land to New∣England; a tedious journey through the woods and wil∣derness, over bogs and great rivers. We took horse at the head of Tredaven Creek, and travelled through the woods till we came a little above the head of Miles River; by which we passed, and rode to the head of Wye River; and so to the head of Chester River; where, making a fire, we took up our lodging in the woods. Next morning we travelled the woods till we came to Sassafras River, which we went over in canoes (or Indian boats) causing our horses to swim by. Then we rode to Bohemia River; where in like manner swimming our horses, we ourselves went over in canoes. We rested a little at a plantation by the way, but not long, for we had thirty miles to ride that af∣ternoon, if we would reach a town; which we were willing to do, and therefore rode hard for it. I with some others, whose horses were strong, got to the town that night ex∣ceedingly tired, and wet to the skin; but George Pattison and Robert Widders, being weaker-horsed, were obliged to lay in the woods that night also. The town we went to was a Dutch town, called Newcastle; whither Robert Wid∣ders and George Pattison came to us next morning. We departed thence, and got over the river Delaware, not with∣out great danger of some of our lives. When we were over, we were troubled to procure guides; which were hard to get, and very chargeable. Then had we that wilderness country to pass through, since called West Jersey, not then inhabited by English; so that we have travelled a whole day together without seeing man or woman, house or dwel∣ling-place. Sometimes we lay in the woods by a fire, and sometimes in the Indians wigwams or houses. We came
<PB N="148" REF="037441_0664_100D927F527BDF60"/>one night to an Indian town, and lay at the king's house, who was a very pretty man. Both he and his wife received us very lovingly, and his attendants (such as they were) were very respectful to us. They laid us mats to lie on; but provision was very short with them, having caught but little that day. At another Indian town, where we staid, the king came to us, and he could speak some English. I spoke to him much, and also to his people; and they were very loving to us. At length we came to Middletown, an English plantation in East Jersey; and there were some friends; but we could not stay to have a meeting at that time, being earnestly pressed in our spirits to get to the half-year's meeting of friends at Oyster-Bay in Long∣Island, which was near at hand. We went with a friend, Richard Hartshorn, brother to Hugh Hartshorn, the up∣holsterer in London, who received us gladly to his house, where we refreshed ourselves, and then he carried us and our horses in his own beat over a great water, which held us most part of the day in getting over, and set us upon Long-Island. We got that evening to friends at Grave, send, with whom we tarried that night. Next day we got to Flushing. The day following we reached Oyster-Bay; several friends both of Gravesend and Flushing accompany∣ing us. The half-year's meeting began next day, which lasted four days. The first and second days we had pub∣lick meetings for worship, to which people of all sorts might and did come. On third-day were the men's and women's meetings, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of. Here we met with some bad spirits, who were run out from truth into prejudice, contention, and opposition to the order of truth, and to friends therein. These had been very troublesome to friends in their meetings, there and there abouts formerly, and it is like would have been so now; but I would not suffer the service of our men's and women's meetings to be interrupted and hindered by their cavils. I let them know, <Q>if they had any thing to object against the order of truth which we were in, we would give them a meeting another day on purpose.</Q> And indeed I labour∣ed the more, and travelled the harder to get to this meeting, where it was expected many of these contentious people would be; because I understood they had reflected much upon me when I was far from them. The men's and wo∣men's meetings being over, on the fourth day we had a meeting with those discontented people, to which as many
<PB N="149" REF="037441_0665_100D9281568DCDC0"/>of them as would did come, and as many friends as had a desire were present also; and the Lord's power broke forth gloriously, to the confounding of the gainsayers. Then some, that had been chief in the mischievous work of con∣tention and opposition against the truth, began to fawn up∣on me, and cast the blame upon others; but the deceitsul spirit was judged down and condemned, and the glorious truth of God was exalted and set over all; and they were all brought down and bowed under. Which was of great service to truth, and great satisfaction and comfort to friends; glory to the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>After friends were gone to their several habitations, we staid some days upon the island, had meetings in several parts thereof, and good service for the Lord. When we were clear of the island, we returned to Oyster-Bay, wait∣ing for a wind to carry us to Rhode-Island, computed to be about two hundred miles. As soon as the wind served we set sail, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rived in Rhode-Island the thirtieth of the third month; where we were gladly received by friends. We went to Nicholas Easton's who was governor of the island; where we lay, being weary with travelling. On first-day following we had a large meeting; to which the deputy-governor and several justices came, and were mighti∣ly affected with the truth. The week following, the yearly meeting for friends of New-England, and other colonies adjacent, was held in this island; to which, besides many friends who lived in those parts, came John Stubbs from Barbadoes, and James Lancaster and John Cartwright from another way. This meeting lasted six days. The first four were spent in general publick meetings for worship; to which abundance of other people came. For having no priests in the island, and no restriction to any particular way of worship; and the governor and deputy-governor, with several justices of the peace, daily frequenting meet∣ings; it so encouraged the people, that they flocked in from all parts of the island. Very good service we had amongst them, and truth and good reception. I have rarely observ∣ed a people, in the state wherein they stood, to hear with more attention, diligence, and affection, than generally they did, during the four days; which was also taken notice of by other friends. These public meetings over, the men's meeting began, which was large, precious, and weighty. The day following was the women's meeting, which al∣so was large and very solemn. These two meetings be∣ing
<PB N="150" REF="037441_0666_100D9283438371D0"/>for ordering the affairs of the church, many weighty things were opened, and communicated to them, by way of advice, information, and instruction in the services relating thereunto; that all might be kept clean sweet, and savoury amongst them. In these, several men's and women's meet∣ings for other parts were agreed and settled, to take care of the poor, and other affairs of the church, and to see that all who profess truth walk according to the glorious gospel of God. When this great general meeting was ended, it was somewhat hard for friends to part; for the glorious power of the Lord, which was over all, and his blessed truth and life flowing amongst them, had so knit and united them to∣gether, that they spent two days in taking leave one of ano∣ther, and of the friends of the island; and then, being mightily filled with the presence and power of the Lord, they went away with jovful hearts to their several habita∣tions, in the several colonies where they lived.</P>
<P>When friends had taken their leave one of another, we, who travelled amongst them, dispersed ourselves into our several services, as the Lord ordered us. John Burnyeate, John Cartwright, and George Pattison went into the east∣ern parts of New-England, in company with the friends that came from thence, to visit the particular meetings there; whom John Stubbs and James Lancaster intended to follow awhile after, in the same service; but they were not yet clear of this island. Robert Widders and I staid longer upon this island; finding service still here for the Lord, through the great openness, and the daily coming in of fresh people from other colonies, for some time, after the general meeting; so that we had many large and serviceable meetings among them.</P>
<P>During this time, a marriage was celebrated amongst friends in this island, and we were present. It was at a friend's house, who had formerly been governor of the island: and three justices of the peace, with many others not in profession with us, and friends also said, They never saw such a solemn assembly on such an occasion, so weighty a marriage, and so comely an order. Thus truth was set over all. This might serve for an example to others; for there were some present from many other places.</P>
<P>After this I had a great travail in spirit concerning the Ranters in those parts, who had been rude at a meeting which I was not at. Wherefore I appointed a meeting amongst them believing the Lord would give me power
<PB N="151" REF="037441_0667_100D92851790D258"/>over them; which he did, to his praise and glory, blessed be his name for ever! There were at this meeting many friends, and divers other people; some of whom were jus∣tices of the peace, and officers, who were generally well af∣fected with the truth. One, who had been a justice twenty years, was convinced, spoke highly of the truth, and more highly of me than is fit for me to mention or take notice of.</P>
<P>We had a meeting at Providence, which was very large, consisting of many sorts of people: I had a great travail up∣on my spirit, that it might be preserved quiet, and that truth might be brought over the people, and might gain en∣trance and have place in them; for they were generally above the priests, in high notions; and some came on pur∣pose to dispute. But the Lord, whom we waited upon, was with us, his power went over them all; and his blessed Seed was exalted and set above all. The disputers were silent, and the meeting quiet, and ended well; praised be the Lord! The people went away mightily satisfied, much desiring another meeting. This place (called Providence) was about thirty miles from Rhode-Island; we went to it by water. The governor of Rhode-Island, and many others, went with me thither; and we had the meeting in a great barn, which was thronged with people, so that I was exceeding hot, and in a great sweat; but all was well; the glorious power of the Lord shined over all, glory to the great God for ever!</P>
<P>After this we went to Narraganset, about twenty miles from Rhode-Island; and the governor went with us. We had a meeting at a justice's, where friends never had any be∣fore. The meeting was very large, for the country general∣ly came in; and people from Connecticut, and other parts round about. There were four justices of peace. Most of these people were such as had never heard friends before; but they were mightily affected, and a great desire there is after the truth amongst them. So that meeting was of very good service; blessed be the Lord for ever! The justice, at whose house it was, and another justice of that country, in∣vited me to come again; but I was then clear of those parts, and was going towards Shelter-island. John Burnyeate and John Cartwright, being come out of New-England in∣to Rhode-Island before I was gone, I laid this place before them, and they felt drawings thither, and went to visit them. At another place, I heard some of the magistrates said among themselves, <Q>If they had money enough, they would hire
<PB N="152" REF="037441_0668_100D928771B86C90"/>me to be their minister.</Q> This was, where they did not well understand us, and our principles: but when I heard of it, I said, <Q>It was time for me to be gone; for if their eye was so much to me, or any of us, they would not come to their own teacher.</Q> For this thing (hiring ministers) had spoiled many, by hindering them from improving their own talents; whereas our labour is, to bring every one to their own teacher in themselves.</P>
<P>I went from hence towards Shelter-Island, having with me Robert Widders, James Lancaster, George Partison, and John Jay, a planter in Barbadoes. We went off in a sloop; and passing by Point Juda and Block-Island, we came to Fishers-Island, where at night we went on shore, but were not able to stay for the musquetoes (a sort of gnats, or little flies) which abound there, and are very trouble∣some. Wherefore we went into our sloop again, put off from the shore, cast anchor, and lay in our sloop that night. Next day we went into the Sound, but finding our sloop was not able to live in that water, we returned again, and came to anchor before Fishers-Island, where we lay in our sloop that night also. There fell abundance of rain, and our sloop being open, we were exceeding wet. Next day we passed over the waters called the Two Horse Races, and then by Garner's-island; after which we passed by Gull's-island, and got at length to Shelter-island, which though it was but about twenty-seven leagues from Rhode-island, through the difficulty of passage, we were three days in get∣ting thither. The day after, being first-day, we had a meet∣ing there. In the same week, I had a meeting among the Indians, at which were their king, with his council, and about an hundred Indians more. They sat down like friends, and heard very attentively, while I spoke to them by an interpreter, an Indian that could speak English well. After the meeting they appeared very loving, and confessed what was said to them was truth. The next first-day we had a great meeting on the island, to which many people came who had never heard friends before. They were well satisfied with the meeting, and would not go away when it was done till they had spoke with me. I went amongst them, and found they were much taken with the truth; good desires were raised in them, and great love. Blessed be the Lord, his name spreads, and will be great among the nations, and dreadful among the heathen.</P>
<P>White we were in Shelter-island, William Edmundson
<PB N="153" REF="037441_0669_100D9289844FA728"/>came to us, who had been labouring in the work of the Lord in Virginia. From whence he travelled through the Desert-country, through difficulties and many trials, till he came to Roan-oak, where he met with a tender people. After seven weeks service in those parts, sailing to Maryland, and so to New-York, he came from thence to Long-island; where we met with him, and were very glad to hear from him the good service he had for the Lord in the several pla∣ces where he had travelled since he parted from us.</P>
<P>We staid not long in Shelter-island, but entering our sloop again, put to sea for Long-island. We had a very rough passage; the tide run so strong for several hours, that I have not seen the like; and being against us, we could hardly get forward though we had a gale. We were upon the water all that day and the night following, but found our∣selves next day driven back near Fisher's-island. For there was a great fog, and towards day it was very dark, so that we could not see what way we made. Besides, it rained much in the night, which in our open sloop made us very wet. Next day a great storm arose, so that we were fain to go over the Sound, and did get over with much ado. We passed by Faulcon-island, and came to the Main, where we cast anchor till the storm was over. Then we crossed the Sound, all very wet, and much difficulty we had to get to land, the wind being strong against us. But blessed be the Lord God of heaven and earth, and of the seas and waters, all was well. We got safe to Oyster-bay in Long-Island, the seventh of the sixth month, very early in the morning, which, they say, is about two hundred miles from Rhode-Island. At Oyster-bay we had a very large meeting. The same day James Lancaster and Christopher Holder went over the bay to Rye, on the continent, in governor Win∣throp's government, and had a meeting there. From Oyster∣bay we passed about thirty miles to Flushing, where we had a very large meeting, many hundreds of people being there; some of whom came about thirty miles to it. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was (praised be the Lord God!) and the people were much satisfied. Meanwhile Christo∣pher Holder and some other friends went to a town in Long-Island, called Jamaica, and had a meeting there. We passed from Flushing to Gravesend, about twenty miles, and there had three precious meetings; to which many would have come from New-York, but that the wea∣ther hindered them. Being clear of this place, we hired a
<PB N="154" REF="037441_0670_100D928B77473308"/>sloop, and, the wind serving, set out for the new country now called Jersey. Passing down the bay by Conny-island, Natton-island, and Stratton-island, we came to Richard Hartshorn's at Middletown-harbour, about break of day, the twenty-seventh of the sixth month. Next day we rode about thirty miles into that country, through the woods, and over very bad bogs, one worse than all the rest; the descent into which was so steep that we were fain to slide down with our horses, and then let them lie and breathe themselves before they could go on. This place the peo∣ple of the country called Purgatory. We got at length to Shrewsbury, in East-Jersey, and on first-day had a precious meeting there; to which friends and other people came far, and the blessed presence of the Lord was with us. The same week we had a men's and women's meeting out of most parts of New-Jersey. They are building a meeting-place in the midst of them, and there is a monthly and general meeting set up, which will be of great service in those parts, in <Q>keeping up the gospel-order, and govern∣ment of Christ Jesus (of the increase of which there is no end) that they who are faithful may see that all who pro∣fess the holy truth live in the pure religion, and walk as 'becometh the gospel.</Q></P>
<P>While we were at Shrewsbury, an accident besel, which for the time was a great exercise to us; John Jay, a friend of Barbadoes, who came with us from Rhode-Island, and intended to accompany us through the Woods to Mary∣land, being to try a horse, got upon his back, and the horse fell a running, cast him down upon his head, and broke his neck, as the people said. Those that were near him took him up as dead, carried him a good way, and laid him on a tree. I got to him as soon as I could; and, feeling him, con∣cluded he was dead. As I stood pitying him and his fa∣mily, I took hold of his hair, and his head turned any way, his neck was so limber. Whereupon I took his head in both my hands, and setting my knees against the tree, I raised his head, and perceived there was nothing out or broken that way. Then I put one hand under his chin, and the other behind his head, and raised his head two or three times with all my strength, and brought it in. I soon perceived his neck began to grow stiff again, and then he began to rattle in his throat, and quickly after to breathe. The people were amazed; but I bade them have a good heart, be of good faith, and carry him into the house. They
<PB N="155" REF="037441_0671_100D928D0C22E730"/>did so, and set him by the fire. I bid them get him some∣thing warm to drink, and put him to bed. After he had been in the house awhile, he began to speak; but did not know where he had been. The next day we passed away (and he with us, pretty well) about sixteen miles, to a meet∣ing at Middletown, through woods and bogs, and over a river; where we swam our horses, and got over ourselves upon a hollow tree. Many hundred miles did he travel with us after this.</P>
<P>To this meeting came most of the people of the town. A glorious meeting we had, and the truth was over all; blessed be the great Lord God for ever! After the meeting we went to Middle-town-harbour, about five miles, in or∣der to take our long journey next morning, through the woods towards Maryland, having hired Indians for our guides. I determined to pass through the woods, on the other side of Delaware-bay, that we might head the creeks and rivers as much as possible. The ninth of the seventh month we set forward, passed through many Indian towns, and over some rivers and bogs. When we had rid about forty miles, we made a fire at night, and lay by it. As we came among the Indians, we declared the day of the Lord to them. Next day we travelled fifty miles, as we comput∣ed; and at night finding an old house, which the Indians had forced the people to leave, we made a fire, and lay there, at the head of Delaware-bay. The next day we swam our horses over a river about a mile, at twice, first to an island called Upper-Dinidock, and then to the main land, having hired Indians to help us over in their canoes. This day we could reach but about thirty miles, and came to a Swede's house, where we got a little straw, and lay that night. Next day, having hired another guide, we travelled about forty miles through the woods, and made a fire at night, by which we lay, and dried ourselves; for we were often wet in our travels. Next day we passed over a des∣perate river, which had in it many rocks and broad stones, very hazardous to us and our horses. From thence we came to Christian-river, where we swam our horses over, and went ourselves in canoes; but the sides of the river were so miry, that some of the horses had like to have been laid up. From thence we came to New-Castle, heretofore called New-Amsterdam; and being very weary, and inquir∣ing in the town where we might buy some corn for our horses, the governor came and invited me to his house, and
<PB N="156" REF="037441_0672_100D928F15E51E28"/>afterwards desired me to lodge there; telling me, he had a bed for me, and I should be welcome. So I staid, the other friends being taken care of also. This was on a seventh day, and he offering his house for a meeting, we had the next day a pretty large one; for most of the town were at it. Here had never been a mecting before, nor any within a great way; but this was a very precious one, many were tender, and confessed to the truth, and some received it; blessed be the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>The sixteenth of the seventh month we set forward, and travelled, as near as we could compute, about fifty miles, through the woods and over the bogs, heading Bohemia-river and Sassafras-river. At night we made a fire in the woods, and lay there all night. It being rainy weather, we got un∣der some thick trees for shelter, and afterwards dried our∣selves again by the fire. Next day we waded through Chester-river, a very broad water, and afterwards passing through many bad bogs, lay that night also in the woods by a fire, not having gone above thirty miles that day. The day following we travelled hard, though we had some troublesome bogs in our way; we rode about fifty miles, and got safe that night to Robert Harwood's, at Miles-river in Maryland. This was the eighteenth of the seventh month; and though we were very weary, and much dirtied with the bogs, yet hearing of a meeting next day, we went to it, and from it to John Edmundson's; from whence we went three or four miles by water to a meeting on the first-day following. Here was a judge's wife, who had never been at any of our meetings before, who was reached, and said after the meeting, <Q>She had rather hear us once, than the priests a thousand times.</Q> Many others also were well satisfied; for the power of the Lord was eminently with us. Blessed for ever be his holy name! We passed from thence about twenty-two miles, and had a good meeting upon the Kentish shore, to which one of the judges came. After ano∣ther good meeting hard-by at William Wilcock's, where we had good service for the Lord, we went by water about twenty miles to a very large meeting, where were some hun∣dreds of people, and four justices of peace, the high-sheriff of Delaware, and others from thence; there was an Indian emperor or governor, and two others of the chief men among the Indians. With these Indians I had a good opportuni∣ty. I spoke to them by an interpreter: they heard the truth attentively; and were very loving. A blessed meeting
<PB N="157" REF="037441_0673_100D9291D0064F68"/>this was, of great service both for convincing, and establish∣ing in the truth those that were convinced of it. Blessed be the Lord, who causeth his blessed truth to spread! After the meeting a woman came to me, whose husband was one of the judges of that country, and a member of the assembly there. She told me, <Q>Her husband was sick, not likely to live, and desired me to go home with her to see him.</Q> It was three miles to her house, and I being just come hot out of the meeting, it was hard for me then to go; yet considering the service, I got an horse, went with her, visited her husband, and spoke what the Lord gave me to him. The man was much refreshed, and finely raised up by the power of the Lord; and afterwards came to our meetings. I went back to the friends that night, and next day we departed thence about nineteen or twenty miles to Tredhaven-creek, to John Edmundson's again; from whence, the third of the eighth month, we went to the general meeting for all Maryland friends.</P>
<P>This meeting held five days. The first three we had meetings for publick worship, to which people of all sorts came; the other two were spent in the men's and women's meetings. To those publick meetings came many Protes∣tants of divers sorts, and some Papists; amongst whom were several magistrates and their wives, with other persons of chief account in the country. Of the common people, it was thought there were sometimes a thousand at one of those meetings; so that though they had enlarged their meeting-place, and made it as big again as it was before, it could not contain the people. I went by boat every day four or five miles to the meeting, and there were so many boats at that time passing upon the river, that it was almost like the Thames. The people said, <Q>There were never so many boats seen there together before;</Q> and one of the justices said, <Q>He never saw so many people together in that country.</Q> It was a very heavenly meeting, wherein the presence of the Lord was gloriously manifested, friends were sweetly refreshed, the people generally satisfied, and many convinced; for the blessed power of the Lord was over all: everlasting praises to his holy name for ever! Af∣ter the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's began, and were held the other two days; for I had some∣thing to impart to them, which concerned the glory of God, the order of the gospel, and the government of Christ Je∣sus. When these meetings were over, we took our leave of
<PB N="158" REF="037441_0674_100D929361B739C0"/>friends in those parts, whom we left well established in the truth. The tenth of the eighth month we went about thirty miles by water, passing by Cranes-island, Swan-island, and Kent-island, in very foul weather and much rain; whereby, our boat being open, we were not only very much wetted, but in great danger of being overset; insomuch that some thought we could not have escaped being cast away, till they saw us come to shore next morning. But blessed be God, we were very well. Having got to a little house, dried our cloaths by the fire; and refreshed ourselves a little, we took to our boat again, and put off from land, some∣times sailing, and sometimes rowing; but having very foul weather, we could not get above twelve miles forward. At night we got to land, made us a sire, by which some lay, and others by a sire at a house a little way off. Next morn∣ing we passed over the Great-bay, and sailed about forty miles that day. Making to shore at night, we lay there, some in the boat, and some at an alehouse. Next morn∣ing being first-day, we went six or seven miles to a friend's house, a justice of the peace; where we had a meeting. This was a little above the head of the Great-bay. We were almost four days upon water, weary with rowing, yet all was very well; blessed and praised be the Lord! We went next day to another friend's over the head of Hatton's∣island, where we had good service; as we had also the day following at George Wilson's, a friend, that lived about three miles further, where we had a very precious meeting, there being great tenderness amongst the people.</P>
<P>After this we sailed about ten miles to James Frizby's, a justice of peace; where, the sixteenth of the eighth month, we had a very large meeting, at which, besides friends, were some hundreds of people, as it was supposed. Amongst them were several justices, captains, and the sheriff, with other persons of note. A blessed heavenly meeting this was; a powerful, thundering testimony for truth was borne therein; a great sense there was upon the people, and much brokenness and tenderness amongst them. We staid till about the eleventh hour in the night, that the tide turned for us; then taking boat, we passed that night and the next day about fifty miles to another; friend's house. The two next days we made short journies, visiting friends. The twentieth we had a great meeting at a place called Severn, where there was a meeting-place, but not large enough to hold the people. Divers chief magistrates were at it, with
<PB N="159" REF="037441_0675_100D9294F40D7468"/>many other considerable people, and it gave them generally great satisfaction. Two days after we had a meeting with some that walked disorderly, and had good service in it. Then spending a day or two in visiting friends, we passed to the Western-shore, and the twenty-fifth had a large and precious meeting at William Coale's, where the speaker of their assembly, with his wife, a justice of peace, and several people of quality, were present. Next day we had a meet∣ing, six or seven miles further, at Abraham Birkhead's, where many of the magistrates and upper sort were; and the speaker of the assembly for that country was convinced. A blessed meeting it was; praised be the Lord! We tra∣velled next day; and the day following, the twenty-eighth, of the eighth month, had a large and very precious meeting at Peter Sharp's, on the Clifts, between thirty and forty miles distant from the former. Many of the magistrates and upper rank of people were present, and a heavenly meeting it was. One of the governor's council's wives was con∣vinced; and her husband was very loving to friends. A justice of peace from Virginia was convinced, and hath a meeting since at his house. Some Papists were at this meet∣ing, one of whom threatened, before he came, to dispute with me; but he was reached, and could not oppose. Blessed be the Lord, the truth reached into the hearts of people beyond words, and it is of a good savour amongst them! After the meeting we went about eighteen miles to James Preston's, a friend that lived on Patuxent River. Thither came an Indian king, with his brother, to whom I spoke, and I found they understood the thing I spoke of. Having finished our service in Maryland, and intending for Virginia, we had a meeting at Patuxent the fourth of the ninth month, to take our leave of friends. Many people of all sorts were at it, and a powerful meeting it was.</P>
<P>The fifth of the ninth month we set sail for Virginia, and in three days came to Nancemum, about two hundred miles from Maryland. In this voyage we met with foul weather, storms, and rain, and lay in the woods by a fire in the night. Here lived a friend, called the widow Wright. Next day we had a great meeting at Nancemum, of friends and others. There came to this meeting colonel Dewes, with several other officers and magistrates, who were much taken with the declaration of truth. After the meeting, we hastened towards Carolina; yet had several meetings by the way, wherein we had good service for the Lord: one about
<PB N="160" REF="037441_0676_100D929773117C80"/>four miles from Nancemum Water, which was very pre∣cious; and there was a men's and a women's meeting set∣tled, for the affairs of the church. Another very good meet∣ing we had at William Yarrow's, at Pagan Creek; which was so large that we were fain to be abroad, the house not being big enough to contain the people. A great openness there was, the sound of truth spread abroad, and had a good savour in the hearts of people: the Lord have the glory for ever!</P>
<P>After this, our way to Carolina grew worse, being much of it plashy, and pretty full of great bogs and swamps; so that we were commonly wet to the knees, and lay abroad a-nights in the woods by a fire: saving one of the nights we got to a poor house at Sommertown, and lay by the fire. The woman of the house had a sense of God upon her. The report of our travel had reached thither, and drawn some that lived beyond Sommertown to that house, in ex∣pectation to have seen and heard us; but they missed us. Next day, the twenty-first of the ninth month, having tra∣velled hard through the woods, and over many bogs and swamps, we reached Bonner's Creek; there we lay that night by the fire-side the woman lending us a mat to lie on.</P>
<P>This was the first house we came to in Carolina: here we left our horses, over-wearied with travel. From hence we went down the creek in a canoe to Macocomocock Ri∣ver, and came to Hugh Smith's where people of other professions came to see us (no friends inhabiting that part of the country) and many of them received us gladly. Amongst others, came Nathaniel Batts, who had been go∣vernor of Roanoak. He went by the name of captain Batts, and had been a rude, desperate man. He asked me about a woman in Cumberland, who, he said, he was told, had been healed by our prayers and laying on of hands, after she had been long sick, and given over by the physi∣cians: he desired to know the certainty of it. I told him, we did not glory in such things, but many such things had been done by the power of Christ.</P>
<P>Not far from hence we had a meeting among the people, and they were taken with the truth; blessed be the Lord! Then passing down the river Maratick in a canoe, we went down the bay Connie-oak, to a captain's, who was loving to us, and lent us his boat (for we were much wetted in the canoe, the water flashing in upon us.) With this boat we went to the governor's; but the water in some places was
<PB N="161" REF="037441_0677_100D929BB7251890"/>so shallow, that the boat, being loaden, could not swim; so that we put off our shoes and stockings, and waded through the water a pretty way. The governor, with his wife, re∣ceived us lovingly; but a doctor there would needs dispute with us. And truly his opposing us was of good service, giving occasion for the opening of many things to the people concerning the Light and Spirit of God, which he denied to be in every one; and affirmed it was not in the Indians. Whereupon I called an Indian to us, and asked him, <Q>Whether or no, when he did lie, or do wrong to any one, there was not something in him that did reprove him for it?</Q> He said, <Q>There was such a thing in him, that did so reprove him; and he was ashamed when he had done wrong, or spoken wrong.</Q> So we shamed the doctor be∣fore the governor and people; insomuch that the poor man ran out so far, that at length he would not own the scrip∣tures. We tarried at the governor's that night; and next morning he very courteously walked with us himself about two miles through the woods, to a place whither he had sent our boat about to meet us. Taking leave of him, we en∣tered our boat, and went about thirty miles to Joseph Scot's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the representatives of the country. There we had a sound, precious meeting; the people were tender, and much desired after meetings. Wherefore at an house about four miles further, we had another meeting; to which the gover∣nor's secretary came, who was chief secretary of the pro∣vince, and had been formerly convinced.</P>
<P>I went from this place among the Indians, and spoke to them by an interpreter, shewing them, <Q>That God made all things in six days, and made but one woman for one man; and that God did drown the old world because of their wickedness. Afterwards I spoke to them concerning Christ, shewing them, that he died for all men, for their sins, as well as for others; and had enlightened them as well as others; and that if they did that which was evil he would burn them; but if they did well they should not be burn∣ed.</Q> There was among them their young king and others of their chief men, who seemed to receive kindly what I said to them.</P>
<P>Having visited the north part of Carolina, and made a little entrance for truth upon the people there, we began to return again towards Virginia, having several meetings in our way, wherein we had good service for the Lord, the people being generally tender and open; blessed be the
<PB N="162" REF="037441_0678_100D929E02BB7A68"/>Lord! We lay one night at the scretary's, to which we had much ado to get; for the water being shallow, we could not bring our boat to shore. But the secretary's wife, see∣ing our strait, came herself in a canoe (her husband be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng from home) and brought us to land. By next morning ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boat was sunk, and full of water; but we got her up, mend∣ed her, and went away in her that day about twenty-four miles, the water being rough, and the winds high: but the great power of God was seen, in carrying us safe in that rot∣ten boat. In our return we had a very precious meeting at Hugh Smith's; praised be the Lord for ever! The people were very tender, and very good service we had amongst them. There was at this meeting an Indian captain, who was very loving; and acknowledged it to be truth that was spoken. There was also one of the Indian priest, whom they called a Pauwaw, who sat soberly among the people. The ninth of the tenth month we got back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bonner's-Creek, where we had left our horses; having spent about eighteen days in the north of Carolina.</P>
<P>Our horses having rested, we set forward for Virginia again, travelling through the woods and bogs as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could well reach that day, and at night lay by a fire in the woods. Next day we had a tedious journey through bogs and swamps, and were exceeding wet and dirty all the day, but dried ourselves at night by a fire. We got that night to Sommertown. When we came near the house, the woman of the house seeing us, spoke to her son to keep up their dogs (for both in Virginia and Carolina they generally keep great dogs to guard their houses, living lonely in the woods) but the son said, <Q>He need not, for their dogs did not use to meddle with these people.</Q> Whereupon, when we were come into the house, she told us. <Q>We were like the chil∣dren of Israel, whom the dogs did not move their tongues against.</Q> Here we lay in our cloaths by the fire, as we had done many a night before. Next day we had a meet∣ing; for the people, having been informed of us, had a great desire to hear us; and a very good meeting we had among them, where we never had one before: praised be the Lord for ever! After the meeting we hasted away. When we had rid about twenty miles, calling at a house to enquire the way, the people desired us to tarry all night with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem: which we did. Next day we came among friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we had travelled about an hundred miles from Caroline into Virginia: in which time we observed great variety of cli∣mates,
<PB N="163" REF="037441_0679_100D929FD208DDF8"/>having passed in a few days from a very cold to a warm and spring-like country. But the power of the Lord is the same in all; is over all, and doth reach the good in all; praised be the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>We spent about three weeks in travelling through Vir∣ginia mostly amongst friends, having large and precious meetings in several parts of the country; as at the widow Wright's, where many of the magistrates, officers, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh people came. A most heavenly meeting we had; wherein the power of the Lord was so great, that it struck a dread upon the assembly, chained all down, and brought reverence upon the people's minds. Among the officers was a major, kinsman to the priest, who told me, <Q>The priest threatened to come and oppose us.</Q> But the Lord's power was too strong for him, and stopped him, and we were quiet and peaceable. The people were wonderfully affected with the testimony of truth; blessed be the Lord for ever! Another very good meeting we had at Cricka∣trough, at which many considerable people were, who had never heard a friend before; and they were greatly satisfied, praised be the Lord! We had also a very good and ser∣viceable meeting at John Porter's, which consisted mostly of other people, in which the power of the Lord was glori∣ously seen and felt, and it brought the truth over all the bad walkers and talkers; blessed be the Lord! Divers other meetings we had, and many opportunities of service for the Lord amongst the people where we came. The last week that we staid we spent some time and pains among friends, sweeping away that which was to be swept out, and work∣ing down a bad spirit that was got up in some: and blessed for ever be the name of the Lord! he it is that gives victory over all.</P>
<P>Having sinished what service lay upon us at Virginia, the thirtieth of the tenth month we set sail in an open sloop for Maryland. But having a great storm, and being much wetted, we were glad to get to shore before night; and, walking to an house at Willoughby-Point, we got lodging there that night. The woman of the house was a widow, a very tender person. She had never received friends be∣fore; but she received us very kindly, with tears in her eyes. We returned to our boat in the morning, and hoisied sail, getting forward as fast as we could; but towards evening a storm rising, the wind being high, we had much ado to get to shore; and our boat being open, the water stashed often
<PB N="164" REF="037441_0680_100D92A36A70C6D0"/>in, and sometimes over us, so that we were sufficiently wet∣ted. Being got to land, we made a fire in the woods, to warm and dry us; and there we lay all that night, the wolves howling about us. The first of the eleventh month we sailed again, but the wind being against us, we made but little way; and were fain to get to shore at Point-Comfort, where yet we found but small comfort; for the weather was so cold, that though we made a good fire in the woods to lie by, our water that we had got for use was frozen near the fire-side. We made to sea next day; but the wind be∣ing strong against us, we advanced but little; and were glad to get to land again, and travel about to find some house where we might buy provisions, for our store was spent. That night also we lay in the woods; so extreme cold was the weather, the wind blowing high, and the frost and snow great, that it was hard for some to abide it. The third of the eleventh month, the wind setting pretty fair, we fetch∣ed it up by sailing and rowing, and got to Milford-Haven, where we lay at Richard Long's near Quince's-Island. Next day we passed by Rappahannock-river, where dwell much people; and friends had a meeting there-away at a justice's, who had formerly been at a meeting where I was. We passed over Powtomack-river also, the winds being high, the water very rough, the weather extreme cold; and having a meeting there-away, some were convinced; and when we parted thence, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of our company went amongst them. We steered our course for Patuxent-river. I sat at the helm most part of the day, and some of the night. About the first hour in the morning we reached James Preston's on Patuxent-river, which is accounted about two hundred miles from Nancemum in Virginia. We were very weary; yet the next day, being the first of the week, we went to the meeting not far from thence. The same week we went to an Indian king's cabin, where several Indians were, with whom we had a pretty opportunity to discourse, and they carried themselves very lovingly. We went also that week to a general meeting; from thence about eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en miles fur∣ther to John Geary's, where we had a very precious meet∣ing; praised be the Lord God for ever! After this the cold grew so exceeding sharp, such extreme frost and snowy wea∣ther beyond what was usual in that country, that we could hardly endure to be in it. Neither was it easy or safe to stir abroad: yet we got with some difficulty six miles through the snow to John Mayor's, where we met with some friends
<PB N="165" REF="037441_0681_100D92A654486DB8"/>that were come from New-England, whom we had left there when we came away; and glad we were to see each other, after such long and tedious travels. By these friends we understood William Edmundson, having been at Rhode-Island and New-England, was gone from thence for Ire∣land; that Solomon Eccles coming from Jamaica, and landing at Boston in New-England, was taken at a meeting there, and banished to Barbado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that John Stubbs and another friend were gone into New-Jersey, and several other friends to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the Leeward Islands. It was matter of joy to us to understand the work of the Lord went on and prospered, and that friends were un∣wearied and diligent in the service.</P>
<P>The twenty-seventh of the eleventh month we had a very precious meeting in a tobacco-house. The next day we returned to James Preston's, about eighteen miles distant. When we came there, we found his house was burnt down to the ground the night before, through the carelessness of a maid servant; so we lay three nights on the ground by the fire, the weather being very cold. We made an observa∣tion which was somewhat strange, but certainly true; that one day in the midst of this cold weather, the wind turning into the south, it grew so hot, that we could hardly bear the heat; and the next day and night, the wind chopping back into the north, we could hardly endure the cold.</P>
<P>The second of the twelfth month we had a glorious meet∣ing at Patuxent; and after it went to John Geary's again, where we waited for a boat to carry us to the monthly meet∣ing at the Clifts; to which we went, and a living meeting it was; praised be the Lord! This was on the sixth of the twelfth month. Another meeting we had on the ninth, wherein the glory of the Lord shined over all; blessed and magnified be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>The twelfth of the twelfth month we set forward in our boat, and, travelling by night, we run our boat on ground in a creek near Manaco River. There we were fain to stay till morning, that the tide came and lifted her off. In the meantime sitting in an open boat, and the weather being bitter cold, some had like to have lost the use of their hands, they were so frozen and benumbed. In the morn∣ing, when the tide set our boat a-float, we got to land, and made a good fire, at which we warmed ourselves well, and then took boat and passed about ten miles farther to a friend's house, where next day we had a very precious
<PB N="166" REF="037441_0682_100D92A7E4CC22B0"/>meeting, at which some of the chief of the place were. I went after the meeting to a friend's about four miles off, at the head of Anamessy River, where the day following the judge of the country and a justice with him came to me, and were very loving, and much satisfied with friends or∣der. The next day we had a large meeting at the justice's in his barn, for his house could not hold the company. There were several of the great folks of that country, and among the rest an opposer; but all was preserved quiet and well. A precious meeting it was; the people were much affected with the truth; blessed be the Lord! We went next day to see captain Colburn, a justice of peace, and there we had some service. Then returning again, we had a very glorious meeting at the justices where we met before, to which came many people of account in the world, ma∣gistrates, officers, and others. It was a large meeting, and the power of the Lord was much felt, so that the people were generally well satisfied and taken with the truth; and there being several merchants and masters of ships from New-England, the truth was spread abroad; blessed be the Lord!</P>
<P>A day or two after we travelled about sixteen miler through the woods and bogs heading Anamessy River and Amoroca River, part of which we went over in a canoe, and came to Manaoke, to a friendly woman's house, where on the twenty-fourth of the twelfth month we had a large meeting in a barn. The Lord's living presence was with us and among the people; blessed be his holy name for ever∣more! Friends never had a meeting in those parts before. After this, we passed over the river Wicocomaco, and through many bad watery swamps and marshy way, and came to James Jones's, a friend and a justice of the peace, where we had a large and very glorious meeting; praised be the Lord God! Then passing over the water in a boat, we took horse, and travelled about twenty-four miles through woods and troublesome swamps, and came to another jus∣tice's house, where we had a very large meeting much peo∣ple and many of considerable account being present; and the living presence of the Lord was amongst us; praised for ever be his holy name! This was the third of the first month 1672-3. The fifth of the same we had another living and heavenly meeting, at which divers justices with their wives and many others were; amongst whom we had very good service for the Lord; blessed be his holy name!
<PB N="167" REF="037441_0683_100D92AA335EECB8"/>At this meeting was a woman that lived at Anamessy, who had been many years in trouble of mind, and sometimes would sit moping near two months together, and hardly speak or mind any thing. When I heard of her, I was moved of the Lord to go to her, and tell her, <Q>That sal∣vation was come to her house.</Q> After I had spoken the word of life to her, and intreated the Lord for her, she mended, went up and down with us to meetings, and is since well blessed be the Lord!</P>
<P>We left Anamessy the seventh of the first month; and passing by water about fifty miles, came to a friendly wo∣man's hous at Hunger River. We had very rough wea∣ther in our passage to this place, and were in great danger, for the boat had like to have been turned over. But through the good providence of God we got safe thither; praised be hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name! At this place we had a meeting. Amongst the people were two Papists, a man and a wo∣man; the man was very tender, and the woman confessed to the truth. I had no friend with me but Robert Wid∣ders, the rest having dispersed themselves into several parts of the country in the service of truth.</P>
<P>So soon as the wind would permit, we passed from hence about forty miles by water, rowing most part of the way, and came to the head of Little Choptanck River, to Dr. Winsmore's, a justice of peace, lately convinced. Here we met with some friends, with whom we staid awhile, and then went on by land and water, and had a large meeting abroad, for the house we were at could not receive the peo∣ple. Divers of the magistrates and their wives were pre∣sent; and a good meeting it was; blessed be the Lord, who is making his name known in that wilderness country! We went from thence to William Stephens's, where we met with those friends that had been travelling in other parts; and were much refreshed in the Lord together, when we imparted to each other the good success we had in the Lord's work, and the prosperity and spreading of truth in the pla∣ces where we travelled. John Cartwright and another friend had been at irginia, where were great desires in people after the truth; and being now returned, they staid a little with us here, and then set forward for Barbadoes. Before we left this place, we had a very glorious meeting, at which were many people; amongst others, the judge of that coun∣try, three justices of the peace, and the high-sheriff, with their wives. Of the Indians, was one called their emperor,
<PB N="168" REF="037441_0684_100D92ACD7D5CE80"/>an Indian king, and their speaker, who sat very attentive, and carried themselves very lovingly. An establishing, set∣tling meeting it was. This was the twenty-third of the first month.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth we went by water ten miles to the In∣dian town where this emperor dwelt; whom I had ac∣quainted before with my coming, and desired to get their kings and councils together. In the morning the emperor came himself, and had me to the town; where they were generally come together, their speaker and other officers be∣ing with them, and the old empress sat among them. They sat very grave and sober, and were all very attentive, be∣yond many called Christians. I had some with me that could interpret to them. We had a very good meeting with them, and of considerable service it was; for it gave them a good esteem of truth and friends; blessed be the Lord!</P>
<P>After this we had meetings in several parts of that coun∣try; one at William Stephens's, which was a general meeting once a month; another at Tredhaven Creek, another at Wye, another at Reconow Creek, and another at Thomas Taylor's in the island of Kent. Most of these were large, there being many people at them, and divers of the most considerable in the world's account. The Lord's power and living presence was with us, and plenteously manifested amongst the people, by which their hearts were tendered, and opened to receive the truth, which had a good savour amongst them; blessed be the Lord God over all for ever! Being clear of that side, we passed over the bay about four∣teen miles to a friend's house, where we met with several friends. I sent for Thomas Thurston thither, and had a meeting with him, to bring the truth over his bad actions.</P>
<P>Having travelled through most parts of that country, and visited most of the plantations, having alarmed people of all sorts where we came, and proclaimed the day of God's salvation amongst them, we found our spirits began to be clear of those parts of the world, and to draw towards Old England again. Yet we were desirous and felt freedom from the Lord to stay till the general meeting for the pro∣vince of Maryland was over (which drew nigh) that we might see friends generally together before we departed. Wherefore spending our time in the interim in visiting friends and friendly people, in attending meetings about the Clifts and Patuxent, in writing answers to some cavilling objections which adversaries had raised and spread abroad
<PB N="169" REF="037441_0685_100D92AED846DFD0"/>to hinder people from receiving the truth; we were not idle, but laboured in the work of the Lord until that general pro∣vincial meeting, which began the seventeenth of the third month, and lasted four days. The first of these days the men and women had their meetings for business, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of, and many things relating thereto were opened to their edification and comfort. The other three days were spent in publick meetings for the worship of God, at which divers of con∣siderable account in the government, and many others were present; who were generally satisfied, and many of them reached; for it was a wonderful glorious meeting, and the mighty presence of the Lord was seen and felt over all; blessed and praised be his holy name for ever, who over all giveth dominion!</P>
<P>After this meeting we took our leave of friends, parting in great tenderness, in the sense of the heavenly life and virtuous power of the Lord that was livingly felt amongst us, and went by water to the place where we were to take shipping; many friends accompanying us thither and tar∣rying with us that night. Next day, the twenty-first of the third month, 1673, we set sail for England: the same day Richard Covell came on board our ship, his own being taken from him by the Dutch. We had foul weather and contrary winds, which caused us to cast anchor often, so that we were till the thirty-first of the third month ere we passed the capes of Virginia into the main sea. But after this we made good speed, and the twenty-eighth of the fourth month cast anchor at King's Road, the harbour for Bristol. We had in our passage very high winds and tem∣pestuous weather, which made the sea exceeding rough, the waves rising like mountains, so that the masters and sailors wondered, and said, 'They never saw the like before.' But though the wind was strong, it sat for the most part with us, so that we sailed before it; and the great God who com∣mands the winds, who is Lord of heaven; earth, and the seas, and whose wonders are seen in the deep, steered our course, and preserved us from many imminent dangers. The same good hand of Providence that went with us, and carried us safely over, watched over us in our return, and brought us safely back again. Thanksgivings and praises be to his holy name for ever! Many sweet and precious meetings we had on board the ship during this voyage (commonly two a week) wherein the blessed presence of the
<PB N="170" REF="037441_0686_100D92B06E69C660"/>Lord did greatly refresh us, and often break in upon and tender the company. When we came into Bristol harbour, there lay a man of war, and the press-master came on board to impress our men. We had a meeting at that time in the ship with the seamen, before we went to shore; and the press-master sat down with us, staid the meeting, and was well satisfied with it.

<P>THIS day we came into Bristol, near night, from the sea; glory to the Lord God over all for ever, who was our convoy, and steered our course! who is the God of the whole earth, of the seas and winds, and made the clouds his chariots, beyond all words, blessed be his name for ever! He is over all in his great power and wisdom, Amen. Robert Widders and James Lancaster are with me, and we are well. Glory to the Lord for ever, who hath carried us through many perils, perils by water, and in storms, prrils by pirates and robbers, perils in the wil∣derness, and amongst false professors; praises to him whose glory is over all for ever, Amen! Therefore mind the fresh life, and all live to God in it. I intend (if the Lord will) to stay awhile this way. It may be till the fair. So no more, but my love to all friends.</P>

<P>Between this and the fair my wife came out of the north to Bristol, and her son-in-law Thomas Lower with two of her daughters with her. Her other son-in-law John Rouse, W. Penn and his wife, and Gerrard Roberts came from London, and many friends from several parts of the nation to the fair, and glorious powerful meetings we had there; for the Lord's insinite power and life was over all. In the fresh openings whereof I was moved to declare of Three
<PB N="171" REF="037441_0687_100D92B268C57830"/>Estates and Three Teachers, viz. <Q>God was the first teach∣er of man and woman in paradise; and as long as they kept to and under his teaching, they kept in the image of God, in his likeness, in righteousness and holiness, and in dominion over all that God had made; in the blessed state, in the paradise of God. But when they hearkened to the serpent's false teaching (who was out of truth) disobey∣ed God, and obeyed the serpent, in feeding upon that which God forbad; they lost the image of God, the righ∣teousness and holiness, came under the power of Satan, and were turned out of paradise, out of the blessed into the cursed state. Then the promise of God was, <Q>That the Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head,</Q> break his power that man and woman were under, and destroy his works. So here were Three States and Three Teachers. God was the First Teacher in paradise; and whilst man kept under his teaching, he was happy. The serpent was the second teacher; and when man followed his teaching, he fell into misery, into the fall from the image of God, righteousness, and holiness, and from the power that he had over all that God had made; and came under the serpent whom he had power over before. Christ Jesus was the Third Teacher; of whom God saith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him:</Q> and who himself saith, "Learn of me." This is the true gospel-teacher, who bruises the head of the ser∣pent the false teacher, and the head of all false teachers and false religions, false ways, false worships, and false churches. Christ, who said, who said, "Learn of me," and of whom the Father said, "Hear ye him," said, <Q>I am the way to God, I am the truth, I am the life, and the true light.</Q> So as man and woman come to God, and are renewed up into his image, righteousness, and holiness by Christ, there∣by they come into the paradise of God, the state which man was in before he sell; and into an higher state than that, to sit down in Christ who never fell. Therefore the Son of God is to be heard in all things, who is the Saviour and the Redeemer; who hath laid down his life, and bought his sheep with his precious blood. We can chal∣lenge all the world. Who hath any thing to say against our way? our Saviour? our Redeemer? our Prophet, whom God hath raised up that we may hear, and whom we must hear in all things? Who hath any thing against our Shepherd, Christ Jesus, who leads and seeds us, and
<PB N="172" REF="037441_0688_100D92B46CA24118"/>we know his heavenly voice? Who hath any thing against our Bishop, in whose mouth was never guile found, who doth oversee us in his pasture of life, that we do not go astray out of his fold? Who hath any thing against our Priest, Christ Jesus, made higher than the heavens, who gives us freely, and commands us to give freely? Who hath any thing to say against our Leader and Counsellor, Christ Jesus, who never sinned, but is holy, harmless, and separate from sinners? God hath commanded us to hear him, and he saith, "Learn of me;" and if we should disobey God's and Christ's command, we should be like our father Adam and mother Eve, who disobeyed God's command, and hearkened to the serpent's teaching. Man commands, and would force us to hear the hirelings, who plead for sin and the body of death to the grave; which doctrine savours of the devil's teaching, not of Christ's; but we resolve to hear the Son, as both the Father and he command; and in hearing the Son, we hear the Father also, as the scripture testifies. For the author to the He∣brews says, <Q>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the pro∣phets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son:</Q> Mark that, God hath spoken unto us (his apostles, disci∣ples, and church) by his Son. And whereas some have objected, <Q>That although Christ did speak both to his disciples and to the Jews in the days of his flesh, yet since his resurrection and ascension he doth not speak now;</Q> the answer is, as God did then speak by his Son in the days of his flesh, so the Son, Christ Jesus, doth now speak by his Spirit. Wherefore John saith in the Revelations, <Q>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches,</Q> Rev. ii. And Christ is said to <Q>speak from heaven,</Q> Heb. xii. 25. <Q>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.</Q> They that resisted Moses's law (who spake on earth) died for it without mercy, which was a natural death; but they that refuse him that speaks from heaven, neglect and slight their own salvation, and so die a spiritual death, through unbelief and hardness of heart. Therefore was the exhor∣tation given of old, <Q>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</Q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 15. &amp;c. They who neglect or refuse to hear the voice
<PB N="173" REF="037441_0689_100D92B6FA352750"/>of Christ now speaking from heaven in this his gospel-day, harden their hearts. Therefore let all mark well these three states and teachers: the God of truth was the first teacher, while man was in paradise and in innocence. The serpent was the second teacher, the false teacher, who by his false teaching came to be the god of the world which lies in wickedness. Christ Jesus, that bruises the serpent's head, is the third teacher, who saith, "Learn of me;" of whom God saith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him;</Q> and of whom the testi∣mony of the saints of old was, <Q>That God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.</Q> Thus they, that come to be renewed up again into the divine heavenly image in which man was at first made, will know the same God, that was the first teacher of Adam and Eve in para∣dise, to speak to them now by his Son, who changes not; glory be to his name for ever!</Q></P>
<P>Many deep and precious things were opened in those meetings by the eternal Spirit which searcheth and reveal∣eth the deep things of God. After I had finished my ser∣vice for the Lord in that city, I departed into Gloucester∣shire, where we had many large and precious meetings; and the Lord's everlasting power flowed over all. From Glou∣cestershire I passed into Wiltshire, where also we had many blessed meetings. At Slattenford in Wiltshire we had a very good meeting, though we met with much opposition from some, who had set themselves against women's meetings; which I was moved of the Lord to recommend to friends, for the benefit of the church of Christ. <Q>That faithful wo∣men, called to the belief of the truth, made partakers of the same precious faith, and heirs of the same everlasting gospel of life and salvation as the men are, might in like manner come into the possession and practice of the gospel∣order, and therein be meet helps unto the men in the re∣storation, in the service of truth, in the affairs of the church, as they are outwardly in civil or temporal things. That so all the family of God, women as well as men, might know, possess, perform, and discharge their offices and services in the house of God, whereby the poor might be the better taken care of; the younger sort instructed, informed, and taught in the way of God; the loose and disorderly reproved and admonished in the fear of the Lord; the clearness of persons proposing marriage, more closely and strictly inquired into in the wisdom of God;
<PB N="174" REF="037441_0690_100D92B88FFB7DE0"/>and all the members of the spiritual body the church might watch over and be helpful to each other in love.</Q> After these opposers had run into much contention and wrangling, the power of the Lord struck down one of the chief of them, so that his spirit sunk, and he came to be sensible of the evil he had done, in opposing God's heavenly power, con∣fessed his error before friends, and afterwards gave forth a paper of condemnation, wherein he declared, <Q>That he did wilfully oppose (although I often warned him to take heed) until the fire of the Lord did burn within him, and he saw the angel of the Lord with his sword drawn in his hand, ready to cut him off,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the opposition was made at the meeting, yet a very good and serviceable meeting it was; for occa∣sion was thereby administered to answer their objections and cavils, and to open the services of women in and for the church. At this meeting the women's meetings for that county were established in the blessed power of God.</P>
<P>After this I went to Marlborough, and had a meeting there, to which some of the magistrates came, and were civil and moderate. Then passing to Bartholomew Maylin's, I had a very precious meeting there. From thence went a lit∣tle beyond Ore, where we had a blessed meeting, and very large, as we had also soon after upon the border of Hamp∣shire. Then turning into Oxfordshire, we visited friends there; then went to Reading where we had a large meeting. From thence passing into Buckinghamshire, we had many precious meetings in that county. After which we visited friends till we came to Kingston upon Thames, where my wife and her daughter Rachel met me.</P>
<P>I made no long stay at Kingston, but went to London, where I found the Baptists and Socinians, with some old apostates grown very rude, having printed many books against us: so I had a great travail in the Lord's power, before I could get clear of that city. But blessed be the Lord, his power came over them, and all their lying, wic∣ked, scandalous books were answered. I made a short journey into some parts of Essex and Middlesex, visiting friends at their meetings, and their children at the schools, and returned soon to London. After some service there among friends. I went to Kingston, and from thence to Stephen Smith's, in Surrey, where was a very large meet∣ing, many hundreds of people attending it. I staid in these parts till I had cleared myself of the service the Lord
<PB N="175" REF="037441_0691_100D92BA2ACA0678"/>had given me to do there, and then returned by Kingston to London, whither I felt my spirit drawn; having heard that many friends were taken before the magistrates, and di∣vers imprisoned, both in London and in other parts of the nation, for opening their shop-windows upon holy-days and fast-days (as they were called) and for bearing testimony against all such observation of days. Which friends could not but do, knowing that the true Christians did not observe the Jews holy-days in the apostles times, neither could we observe the Heathens and Papists holy days (so called) which have been set up amongst those called Christians since the apostles days. For we were redeemed out of days by Christ Jesus, and brought into the day which hath sprung from on high, and are come into him, who is Lord of the Jewish sabbath, and the substance of the Jews signs.</P>
<P>After I had staid some time in London, labouring for some relief and ease to friends in this case, I went with my wife, and her daughter Rachel, to Hendon, in Middlesex, and from thence to William Penn's at Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire, whither Thomas Lower, who married an∣other of my wife's daughters, came the next day to accom∣pany us in our journey northward. After we had visited friends thereabouts, we passed to a friend's house near Ayles∣bury; and from thence to Bray Doily's at Adderbury, in Oxfordshire, where, on first-day, we had a large and pre∣cious meeting. Truth being well spread, and friends in those parts much increased in number, two or three new meetings were then set up thereabouts.</P>
<P>At night, as I was sitting at supper, I felt I was taken; yet I said nothing to any body of it then. But getting out next morning, we travelled into Worcestershire, and went to john Halford's at Armscot, in Tredington parish; where we had a very large and precious meeting in his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn, the Lord's powerful presence being eminently with and amongst us. After the meeting, friends being most of them gone, as I was sitting in the parlour, discoursing with some friends, Henry Parker, a justice, came to the house, and with him Rowland Hains, a priest of Hunniton, in Warwickshire. This justice came to know of the meeting by means of a woman-friend, who, being nurse to a child of his, asked leave of her mistress to go to the meeting to see me; and she speaking of it to her husband, he and the priest plotted together to break up the meeting, and apprehend me. But by means of their sitting long at dinner, it being the day on

But though there was no meeting when they came, yet I being in the house, who was the person they aimed at, Henry Parker took me, and Thomas Lower for company with me, and though he had nothing to lay to our charge, sent us both to Worcester gaol, by a strange sort of mittimus; a copy of which here followeth:</P>

<P>When we had been some time in the gaol, we thought fit to lay our case before the lord Windsor, lord-lieutenant of Worcestershire, and before the deputy-lieutenants, and other magistrates; which we did by the following letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THESE are to inform you, the lord-lieutenant (so cal∣led) the deputy-lieutenants, and the justices of the county of Worcestershire, how unchristianly and inhumanly we have been dealt withal by Henry Parker, a justice (so cal∣led) in our journey towards the north. We coming to our friend John Halsord's, the 17th of the 10th month, 1673, some friends bringing us on the way, and others coming to visit us there; towards night came the aforesaid justice, and a priest called Rowland Hains, of Hunniton, in Warwickshire, and demanded our names and places of abode. And though we were not in any meeting, but were discoursing together when they came in, he made a mittimus to send us to Worcester gaol. Now whereas he says in his mittimus, <Q>That complaint had been made to him of several by-past meetings of many hundreds at a
<PB N="178" REF="037441_0694_100D92C17A5F3108"/>time;</Q> we know nothing of that, nor do we think that concerns us. And whereas he says further, <Q>That no satisfactory account of our settlement or place of habita∣tion appeared unto him;</Q> this he contradicts in his own mittimus, mentioning therein the places of our abode and habitation; the account of which we satisfactorily and ful∣ly gave him. And one of us (Thomas Lower) told him, that he was going down with his mother-in-law (who is George Fox's wife) and with his sister, to fetch up his own wife and child out of the north into his own country. And the other of us (George Fox) told him, that he was bringing forward his wife on her journey towards the north who had been at London to visit one of her daughters, who had lately lain in. And having received a message from his mother, an ancient woman in Leicestershire, that she earnestly desired to see him before she died, he intend∣ed, as soon as he had brought his wife on her journey as far as Causal, in Warwickshire, to turn into Leicestershire, to visit his mother and relations there, and then to have returned to London. But by his interrupting us in our journey, taking the husband from his wife, the son from his mother and sister, and stopping him from visiting his wife and child so remote, we were forced to get strangers, or whom we could, to help them on their journey, to our great damage and their hindrance. We asked the priest, <Q>whether this was his gospel, and their way of entertaining strangers?</Q> And we desired the justice to consider, whe∣ther this was doing "as he would be done by?" But he said, "He had said it, and he would do it". And where∣as he says, "We refused to give sureties." He asked only George Fox for sureties; who replied, <Q>He was an in∣nocent man, and knew no law he had broken;</Q> but he did not ask Thomas Lower for any, as if it had been crime and cause enough for his commitment that he came out of Cornwall. If we were at a meeting, as he says in his mit∣timus, he might have proceeded otherwise, than by send∣ing us to gaol, to answer the breach of the common laws; though he shewed us no breach of any, as may be seen in the mittimus. We thought fit to lay before you the sub∣stance of his proceedings against us, hoping there will more moderation and justice appear in you towards us, that we may prosecute our intended journey.</P>

But no enlargement did we receive by our application to the lord Windsor (so called.) And although Thomas Lower received several letters from his brother Dr. Lower, who was one of the king's physicians, concerning his liber∣ty, and one, by his procurement, from Henry Savil, who was of the king's bed-chamber; to his brother called the lord Windsor to the same effect; yet seeing it related only to his enlargement, not mine, so great was his love and re∣gard to me, that he would not seek his own liberty singly, but kept the letter by him unsent; so we were continued prisoners till the next general quarter sessions of the peace. At which time divers friends from several places being in town, did speak to the justices concerning us; who spoke fair, and said we should be discharged. For many of the jus∣tices seemed to dislike the severity of Parker's proceedings against us, and declared an averseness to ensnare us by the tender of the oaths. Some friends also had spoken with lord Windsor, who likewise spoke them fair; so that it was the general discourse we should be discharged. We heard also, that Dr. Lower had procured a letter from colonel Sands at London, to some of the justices in our favour. Some of the justices also spoke to some friends, to acquaint us, that they would have us speak but little in the court, lest we should provoke any of the bench, and they would warrant we should be discharged.</P>
<P>We were not called till the last day of the sessions, which was the twenty-first of the eleventh month, 1673. When we came in, they were struck with paleness in their faces, and it was some time before any thing was spoken; insomuch that a butcher in the hall said, <Q>What! are they afraid? Dare not the justices speak to them?</Q> At length, before they spoke to us, justice Parker made a long speech on the bench, much to the same effect as was contained in the mittimus, often mentioning the common laws, but not instancing any we had broken. Adding, <Q>That he thought it a milder course to send us two to gaol, than to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his neighbours to the loss of two hundred pounds, which they must have suffered if he had put the law in execution against conventicles.</Q> But in this he was either very ig∣norant, or very deceitful; for there being no meeting when he came, nor any to inform, he had no evidence to convict us, or his neighbours by.</P>
<P>When Parker had ended his speech, the justices began with Thomas Lower, whom they examined of the cause of
<PB N="180" REF="037441_0696_100D92C5B68F7BC8"/>his coming into that country; of which he gave them a full and plain account. Sometimes I put in a word while they were examining him, and then they told me, <Q>They were upon his examination, when it came to my turn, I should have free liberty to speak, for they would not hinder me; but I should have full time, and they would not ensnare us.</Q> When they had done with him, they asked me an account of my travel, which I gave them, as is mentioned before, but more largely. And whereas justice Parker, to aggravate the case, had made a great noise of <Q>there being some from London, some from the north, some from Corn∣wall, and some from Bristol, at the house when I was taken.</Q> I told him, <Q>This was in a manner all but one family. For there was none from London, but myself; none from the north, but my wife and her daughter; none from Cornwall, but my son-in-law Thomas Lower; nor any from Bristol, but one friend, a merchant there, who me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us, as it were, providentially, to assist my wife and her daughter in their journey homewards, when by our imprisonment they were deprived of our company and help.</Q> When I had spoken, the chairman, whose name was Simpson, an old Presbyterian, said, <Q>Your relation or account is very innocent.</Q> Then he Parker whispered awhile together, and after that the chairman stood up, and said: <Q>You, Mr Fox, are a famous man, and all this may be true which you have said; but that we may be the bet∣ter satisfied, will you take the oaths of allegiance and su∣premacy?</Q> I told them, 'They had said, <Q>They would not ensnare us;</Q> but this was a plain snare: for they 'knew we could not take any oath.; However, they cans∣ed the oath to be read; and when they had done, I told them, <Q>I never took an oath in my life, but I had always been true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the government: that I was cast into prison at Derby, and kept a prisoner six months there, because I would not take up arms against king Charles at Wor∣cester-fight; and for going to mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings, was carried up out of Leicestershire, and brought before Oliver Cromwel, as a plotter to bring in king Charles. And ye know,' said I, in your own consciences, that we, the people called Qua∣kers, cannot take an oath, nor swear in any case, because Christ hath forbidden it. But as to the matter or sub∣stance contained in the oaths, this I can and do say, that I do own and acknowledge the king of England to be lawful heir and successor to the realm of England, and do abhor
<PB N="181" REF="037441_0697_100D92C8389EDB98"/>all plots and plotters, and contrivances against him; and I have nothing in my heart, but love and good-will to him and all men, and desire his and their prosperity; the Lord knows it, before whom I stand an innocent man. And as to the oath of supremacy, I deny the pope, his power, and his religion, and abhor it with my heart.</Q> While I was speaking, they cried, 'Give him the book.' I said, <Q>The book saith, "Swear not at all." Then they cried, Take him away, gaoler;</Q> and I still speaking on, they were urgent upon the gaoler, crying, <Q>Take him away, we shall have a meeting here. Why do you not take him away? That fellow (meaning the gaoler) loves to hear him preach.</Q> Then the gaoler drew me away; and as I was turning from them, I stretched out my arm, and said, <Q>The Lord forgive you, who cast me into prison for obey∣ing the doctrine of Christ.</Q> Thus they apparently broke their promise in the face of the country; for they promised I should have free liberty to speak, but now they would not give it me; and they promised they would not ensnare us, yet now they tendered me the oaths on purpose to en∣snare me.</P>
<P>After I was had away, Thomas Lower was stayed behind in the court; and they told him, 'He was at liberty.' Then he would have reasoned with them, asking them, <Q>Why I might not be set at liberty as well as he, seeing we were both taken together, and our case was alike?</Q> But they told him, 'They would not hear him;' saying, <Q>You may be gone about your business, for we have nothing more to say to you, seeing you are discharged.</Q> This was all he could get from them. Wherefore, after the court was risen, he went to speak with them at their chamber, desiring to know, <Q>What cause they had to detain his father, seeing they had discharged him?</Q> and wishing them to consider, whether this was not partiality, and would be a blemish to them. Whereupon Simpson threatened him, saying, <Q>If you be not content we will tender you the oaths also, and send you to your father.</Q> To which he replied, <Q>They might do that, if they thought fit; but whether they sent him or no, he intended to go and wait upon his father in prison; for that was now his business in that country.</Q> Then said justice Parker to him, <Q>Do you think, Mr. Lower, that I had not cause to send your father and you to prison, when you had such a great meeting that the parson of the parish complained to me, that he hath lost the greatest part of his
<PB N="182" REF="037441_0698_100D92C9CCF686F8"/>parishioners; so that when he comes amongst them he has scarce any auditors left?</Q> 'I have heard,' replied Thomas Lower, <Q>that the priest of that parish comes so seldom to visit his flock (but once, it may be, or twice in a year, to gather up his tithes) that it was but charity in my father to visit such a forlorn and forsaken flock; therefore thou hadst no cause to send my father to prison for visiting them, or for teaching, instructing, and directing them to Christ, their true teacher, who had so little comfort or benefit from their pretended pastor, who comes amongst them only to seck for his "gain from his quarter."</Q> Upon this the justices fell a laughing; for it seems Dr. Crowder, the priest they spoke of, was then sitting among them, though Thomas Lower did not know him; and he had the wit to hold his tongue, and not undertake to vindicate himself in a matter so noto∣riously known to be true. But when Thomas Lower was come from them, the justices did so play upon Dr. Crow∣der, that he was pitifully ashamed, and so nettled with it, that he threatened to sue Thomas Lower in the bishop's court, upon an action of defamation. Which when Tho∣mas Lower heard of, he sent him word, he would answer his suit, let him begin it when he would; and would bring his whole parish in evidence against him. This cooled the doctor. Yet some time after he came to the prison, pre∣tending he had a mind to dispute with me, and to talk with Thomas Lower about that business; and he brought ano∣ther with him, he himself being then a prebendary at Wor∣cester.</P>
<P>When he came in, he asked me, <Q>What I was in prison for?</Q> 'Dost not thou know that?' said I. <Q>Wast not thou upon the bench, when justice Simpson and Parker tendered the oath to me? And hadst not thou an hand in it?</Q> Then he said, <Q>It is lawful to swear; and Christ did not forbid swearing before a magistrate; but swearing by the sun and the like.</Q> I bid him prove that by the scriptures, but he could not. Then he brought that saying of Paul's. 'All things are lawful unto me,' 1 Cor. vi. 12. 'And if,' said he, <Q>all things were lawful unto him, then swearing was lawful unto him.</Q> 'By this argument,' said I, <Q>thou mayst also affirm, that drunkenness, adultery, and all manner of sin and wickedness is lawful also, as well as swearing.</Q> 'Why,' said Dr. Crowder, <Q>do you hold that adultery is unlawful?</Q> 'Yes,' said I, 'that I do.' <Q>Why then,</Q> said he, 'this contradicts the saying of St. Paul.'
<PB N="183" REF="037441_0699_100D92CC15EC6D40"/>Thereupon I called to the prisoners and the gaoler, to hear what doctrine Dr. Crowder had laid down for orthodox, viz. <Q>that drunkenness, swearing, adultery, and such like things were lawful.</Q> Then he said, <Q>He would give it under his hand;</Q> and took a pen, but wrote another thing than what he had spoken. Then turning to Thomas Lower, he asked him, <Q>Whether he would answer what he had there writ∣ten?</Q> Who undertook it. Whereupon, when he had threatened Thomas Lower to sue him in the bishop's court for speaking so abusively (as he called it) of him before the justices, and Thomas had bid him begin when he pleased, for he would answer him, and bring his parishioners in evi∣dence against him, he went away in a great fret, grumbling to himself as he went. A few days after Thomas Lower sent him an answer to the paper he had wrote and left with him; which answer a friend of Worcester carried to him, and he read it, and said, 'He would reply to it;' but he never did, though he often sent him word he would do it.</P>
<P>Soon after the sessions, the term coming on, an Habeas Corpus was sent to Worcester for the sheriff to bring me up to the king's-bench-bar. Whereupon the under-sheriff, having made Thomas Lower his deputy to convey me to London, we set out the twenty-ninth of the eleventh month, 1673, and came to London the second of the twelfth month; the ways being very deep, and the waters out. Next day, notice being given that I was brought up, the sheriff was or∣dered to bring me into court. I went accordingly, and did appear in court before judge Wild; and both he and the lawyers were pretty fair, so that I had time to speak, to clear my innocency, and shew my wrong imprisonment. After the return of the writ was entered, I was ordered to be brought into court again next day; the order of court be∣ing as followeth:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Accordingly I went in the morning, and walked in the hall till the sheriff came to me (for he trusted me to go whi∣ther I would) and it being early, we went into the court of King's Bench, and sat among the lawyers almost an hour, till the judges came in, when the sheriff took off my hat; and after awhile I was called. The Lord's presence was with me, and his power I felt was over all. I stood and heard the king's attorney, whose name was Jones, who in deed spoke notably on my behalf, as did also another coun∣sellor after him; and the judges, who were three, were all very moderate, not casting any reflecting words at me. I stood still in the power and Spirit of the Lord, seeing how the Lord was at work, and the earth was helping the wo∣man. But when they had done, I applied myself to the chief justice, desiring, 'That I might speak;' and he said, I might. <Q>Then I related the cause of our journey, the manner of our being taken and committed, and the time of our imprisonment until the sessions; with a brief ac∣count of our trial at the sessions, and what I had offered to the justices then, as a declaration that I could make or sign, instead of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy.</Q> When I had done, the chief justice said, <Q>I was to be turn∣ed over to the King's-bench, and the sheriff of Worcester to be discharged of me.</Q> He said also, <Q>That they would consider further of it; and if they found any error in the record, or in the justices proceedings, I should be set at liberty.</Q> So a tipstaff was called to take me into custody, and he delivered me to the keeper of the King's-bench, who let me go to a friend's house, where I lodged and appointed to meet me at Edward Man's in Bishopsgate-street the next day. But after this, justice Parker, or some other of my ad∣versaries, moved the court, that I might be sent back to Worcester. Whereupon another day was appointed for another hearing, and they had four counsel that pleaded against me. George Stroude, a counsellor, pleaded for me, and was pleading before I was brought into the court; but they bore him down, and prevailed with the judges to give judgment. <Q>That I should be sent down to Worcester ses∣sions.</Q> Only they told me I might put in bail to appear
<PB N="185" REF="037441_0701_100D92D087B1F880"/>at the sessions, and to be of good behaviour in the mean time. I told them, <Q>I never was of ill behaviour in my life; and that they, the four judges, might as well put the oath to me there, as send me to Worcester to be ensnared by the justices, in their putting the oath to me, and then premuniring me, who never took oath in my life. I told them, if I broke my Yea or Nay, I was content to suffer the same penalty which they should that break their oaths.</Q> This alteration of the judges minds in my case proceeded, as was thought, from some false informations that my adversary justice Parker had given against me: for between the times of my former appearance and this, he had spread abroad a very false and malicious story, viz. <Q>That there were many substantial men with me out of several parts of the nation when he took me, and that we had a design or plot in hand; and that Thomas Lower staid with me in prison long after he was set at liberty, to carry on our design.</Q> This was spoken in the parliament∣house; insomuch that if I had not been brought up to London when I was, I had been stopped at Worcester, and Thomas had been re-committed with me. But although these lies were eafily disproved and laid open to Parker's shame, yet would not the judges alter their last sentence, but remanded me to Worcester gaol; only this favour was granted, that I might go down my own way, and at my own leisure; provided I would be without fail there by the assize, which was to begin the second of the second month following.</P>
<P>I staid in and about London till towards the latter end of the first month 1674, and then went down leisurely (for I was not able to abide hasty and hard travelling) and came into Worcester the last of the first month 1674, being the day before the judges came to town. The second day of the second month I was brought from the gaol to an inn near the hall that I might be in readiness if I should be called. But not being called that day, the gaoler came at night, and told me, 'I might go home,' meaning to the gaol. Gerrard Roberts of London being with me, he and I walked down together to the gaol without any keeper. Next day being brought up again, they set a little boy about eleven years old to be my keeper. I came to under∣stand justice Parker and the clerk of the peace had given order that I should not be put into the calendar, that I might not be brought before the judge; wherefore I got
<PB N="186" REF="037441_0702_100D92D217C63A38"/>the judge's son to move in court, <Q>That I might be called:</Q> whereupon I was called and brought to the bar before judge Turner, my old adversary, who had ten∣dered me the oaths, and premunired me once before at Lancaster. After silence made, he asked me, <Q>What I did desire?</Q> I answered, 'My liberty according to justice.' He said, 'I lay upon the oath;' and asked, <Q>If I would take it?</Q> <Q>I desired he would hear the manner of my being taken and committed;</Q> and being silent, I gave him an account thereof at large, as is before set down, letting him also know, <Q>That since my imprisonment I had under∣stood my mother, who was an ancient, tender woman, and had desired to see me before she died, hearing that I was stopped and imprisoned in my journey, so that I was not likely to come to see her, it struck her so, that she died soon after, which was a very hard thing to me.</Q> When I had done speaking, he again asked me, 'To take the oaths.' I told him, <Q>I could not take any oath, for conscience-sake; and I did believe he and they all knew in their consciences 'that it was for conscience-sake I could not swear at all. I declared amongst them what I could say and what I could sign, in owning of the king's right to the government, and in denying the pope and his pretended power, and all plot∣ters, plots, and conspiracies against the government.</Q> Some thought the judge had a mind to set me at liberty, for he saw they had nothing justly against me; but Parker, who com∣mitted me, endeavoured to incense him, telling him, <Q>That I was a ringleader; that many of the nation followed me, and he knew not what it might come to;</Q> with many more envi∣ous words, which some took notice of; who also observed, that the judge gave him never a word in answer. However, the judge, willing to ease himself, referred me and my case to the sessions again, bidding the justices make an end of it there, and not trouble the assizes any more with me. So I was continued prisoner, chiefly (as it seemed) through the means of justice Parker, who in this case was as false as en∣vious; for he had promised Richard Cannon of London, who had acquaintance with him, <Q>That he would endea∣vour to have me set at liberty;</Q> yet he was the worst ene∣my I had in court, as some of the court observed and re∣ported. Other justices were very loving, and promised. <Q>That I should have the liberty of the town, and to lodge at a friend's house till the sessions;</Q> which accordingly I had, and the people were very civil and respectful to me.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="037441_0703_100D92D4847E0640"/>
Between this time and the sessions I had some service for the Lord with several that came to visit me. At one time came three nonconformist priests and two lawyers to discourse with me; and one of the priests undertook to prove, 'That the scriptures are the only rule of life.' Af∣ter I had defeated his proof, I had a fit opportunity to open to them, <Q>The right and proper use, service, and ex∣cellency of the scriptures; and also to shew, that the Spirit of God which was given to every one to profit withal, the grace of God which bringeth salvation, and which hath appeared to all men, and teacheth them that obey it to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live sober∣ly, righteously, and godly in this present world; that this, I say, is the most fit, proper, and universal rule which God hath given to all mankind to rule, direct, govern, and order their lives by.</Q></P>
<P>Another time came a common-prayer priest, and some people with him. He asked me, <Q>If I was grown up to perfection?</Q> I told him, <Q>What I was, I was by the grace of God.</Q> He replied, 'It was a modest and civil answer.' Then he urged the words of John, <Q>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</Q> He asked, 'What did I say to that?' <Q>I said with the same apostle, <Q>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us;</Q> who came to destroy sin, and to take away sin. So there is a time for people to see that they have sinned, and there is a time for them to see that they have sin; and there is a time for them to confess their sin, and to forsake it, and to know the blood of Christ to cleanse from all sin.</Q> Then the priest was asked, <Q>Whether Adam was not perfect before he sell? and whether all God's works were not perfect?</Q> The priest said, <Q>There might be a perfection as Adam had, and a falling from it.</Q> But I told him, <Q>There is a perfection in Christ above Adam, and beyond falling; and that it was the work of the ministers of Christ to present every man perfect in Christ; for the perfecting of whom they had their gifts from Christ; therefore they that denied per∣fection, denied the work of the ministry, and the gifts which Christ gave for the perfecting of the saints.</Q> The priest said. 'We must always be striving.' I answered, <Q>It was a sad and comfortless sort of striving, to strive with a belief that we should never overcome.</Q> I told him also, that 'Paul, who cried out of the body of death, did also
<PB N="188" REF="037441_0704_100D92D79AB91850"/>
<Q>thank God, who gave him the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</Q> So there was a time of crying out for want 'of victory, and a time of praising God for the victory. 'And Paul said, <Q>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</Q> The priest said, <Q>Job was not per∣fect.</Q> I told him, <Q>God said Job was a perfect man, and that he did shun evil; and the devil was forced to confess, that "God had set an hedge about him;" which was not an outward hedge, but the invisible, heavenly power.</Q> The priest said, 'Job said, <Q>He chargeth his angels with folly, and the heavens are not clean in his sight.</Q> I told him, <Q>That was his mistake, it was not Job said so, but Eliphaz, who contended against Job.</Q> 'Well, but,' said the priest, 'what say you to that scripture, <Q>The justest man that is sinneth seven times a day?</Q> 'Why truly,' said I, 'I say there is no such scripture;' and with that the priest's mouth was stopped. Many other services I had with several sorts of people between the assizes and the sessions.</P>
<P>The next quarter-sessions began the twenty-ninth of the second month, and I was called before the justices. The chairman's name was—Street, he was a judge in the Welsh circuit, and he misrepresented me and my case to the country, telling them <Q>That we had a meeting at Treding∣ton from all parts of the nation, to the terrifying of the king's subjects, for which we had been committed to pri∣son: that for the trial of my fidelity the oaths were put to me; and, having had time to consider of it, he asked me if I would now take the oaths?</Q> <Q>I desired liberty to speak for myself; and, having obtained that, began first to clear myself from those falsehoods he had charged on me and friends; declaring, that we had not any such meeting from all parts of the nation, as he had represented it; but that (except the friend from whose house we came, and who came with us to guide us thither, and one friend of Bris∣tol, who came accidentally, or rather providentially, to assist my wife homewards, after we were taken) they that were with me were in a sense part of my own family, be∣ing my wife, her daughter, and her son-in-law. And we did not meet in any way or manner that would occasion terror to any of the king's subjects; for we met peaceably and quietly, without arms; and I did not believe there could be any one produced that could truly say he was terrified with our meeting. Besides, I told them we were
<PB N="189" REF="037441_0705_100D92D9AC230AB0"/>but in our journey, the occasion whereof I now related as before. As to the oaths, I shewed why I could not take them (seeing Christ hath forbidden all swearing) and what I could say or sign in lieu of them, as I had done before. Yet they caused the oaths to be read to me, and after∣wards read an indictment, which they had drawn up in readiness, having a jury ready also.</Q> When the indict∣ment was read, the judge asked me, 'If I was guilty?' I said, <Q>Nay; for it was a great bundle of lies; which I shewed and proved to the judge in several particulars, which I instanced; asking him, if he did not know in his conscience they were lies?</Q> He said, 'It was their form.' I said, 'It was not a true form.' He asked me again, 'Whether I was guilty?' I told him, <Q>Nay, I was not guilty of the matter, nor of the form; for I was against the 'pope and popery, and did acknowledge and should set my hand to that.</Q> Then the judge told the jury what they should say and do, and what they should write on the back∣side of the indictment; and as he said, they did. But be∣fore the jury gave in their verdict, I told them, <Q>It was for Christ's sake, and in obedience to his and his apostle's command, that I could not swear; therefore,</Q> said I, <Q>take heed what ye do, for before his judgment-seat ye shall all be brought.</Q> The judge said, 'This is canting.' I said, <Q>If to confess Christ our Lord and Saviour, and to obey his command, be called canting by a judge of a court, it is to little purpose for me to say more among you; yet ye shall see that I am a christian, and shall shew forth christianity, and my innocency shall be manifest.</Q> So the gaoler led me out of the court; and the people were generally tender, as if they had been in a meeting. Soon after I was brought in again, and the jury found the bill against me, which I traversed. Then I was asked to put in bail till the next sessions, and the gaoler's son offered to be bound for me. But I stopped him, and warned friends not to meddle, for I told them, 'There was a snare in that;' yet I told the justices, I could promise to appear if the Lord gave health and strength, and I was at liberty. Some of the justices were loving, and would have stopped the rest from indict∣ing me or putting the oath to me; but judge Street the chairman said, 'He must go according to law.' So I was sent to prison again; yet within two hours after, through the moderation of some of the justices, I had liberty given me till next quarter-sessions. These moderate justices, as it
<PB N="190" REF="037441_0706_100D92DB43296ED8"/>was said, desired justice Parker to write to the king for my liberty, or for a Noli prosequi, because they were satisfied I was not such a dangerous person as I had been represent∣ed. This, it was said, he promised to do, but did it not.</P>
<P>After I had got a copy of the indictment, I went to Lon∣don, visiting friends as I went. When I came there, some that were earnest to get me out of the hands of those envious justices that sought to premunire me at Worcester, would needs be tampering again, to bring me before the judges of the King's Bench; whereupon I was brought again by an Habeas Corpus before them. I tendered them a paper, in which was contained what I could say instead of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THIS I do in the truth and in the presence of God de∣clare, That king Charles the Second is lawful king of this realm, and of all other his dominions; that he was brought in and set up king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver this realm by the power of God; and I have nothing but love and good will to him and all his subjects, and desire his prosperity and eternal good. I do utterly abhor and deny the pope's power and supremacy, and all his superstitions and idolatrous inven∣tions; and do affirm, that he hath no power to absolve sin. I do abhor and detest his murdering of princes, or other people, by plots or contrivances. And likewise I do deny all plots and contrivances, and plotters and contriv∣ers against the king and his subjects; knowing them to be the works of darkness, the fruits of an evil spirit, against the peace of the kingdom, and not from the Spirit of God, the fruit of which is love. I dare not take an oath, be∣cause it is forbidden by Christ and the apostle; but if I break my Yea or Nay, let me suffer the same penalty as those that breakthose that break their oaths.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>But the business being so far proceeded in at Worcester, they would not meddle in it, but left me to appear again before the justices at the next general quarter-sessions at Worcester.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the yearly meeting of friends came on, at which I was present; and exceeding glorious the meetings were, beyond expression; blessed be the Lord!</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting, I set forward for Worcester, the sessions drawing on, which were held in the fifth month.
<PB N="191" REF="037441_0707_100D92DD10385030"/>When I was called to the bar, and the indictment read, some scruple arising among the jury concerning it, the judge of the court, justice Street, caused the oaths to be read and tendered to me again. I told him, <Q>I came now to try the traverse of my indictment; and that his tendering me the 'oaths anew, was a new snare. I desired him to answer me a question or two; and asked him, Whether the oaths were to be tendered to the king's subjects, or to the sub∣jects of foreign princes?</Q> He said, <Q>To the subjects of this realm.</Q> 'Then,' said I, <Q>You have not named me a subject in the indictment, and therefore have not brought me within the statute.</Q> The judge cried, <Q>Read the oath to him.</Q> I said, 'I require justice.' Again I asked him, <Q>Whether the sessions ought not to have been holden for the king, and the body of the county?</Q> He said, 'Yes.' 'Then,' said I, you have there left the king out of the in∣dictment; <Q>how then can you proceed upon this indictment to a trial between the king and me, seeing the king is left out?</Q> He said, 'The king was in before.' But I told 'him, <Q>The king's name being left out, here was a great error in the indictment, and sufficient, as I was informed to quash it. Besides, I told him that I was committed by the name of George Fox of London, but now I was indicted by the name of George Fox of Tredington in the county of Worcester. I wished the jury to consider how they could find me guilty upon that indictment, see∣ing I was not of the place the indictment mentioned.</Q> The judge did not deny but there were errors in the indict∣ment; but said, 'I might take my remedy in its proper 'place.' I answered, 'You know that we are a people that 'suffer all things, and bear all things; and therefore ye 'thus use us, because we cannot revenge ourselves; but we 'leave our cause to the Lord.' The judge said, 'The oath 'hath been tendered to you several times, and we will have 'some satisfaction from you concerning the oath.' I offer∣ed them the same declaration instead of the oath, which I had offered to the judges above; but it would not be ac∣cepted. Then I desired to know, seeing they put the oath anew to me, whether the indictment was quashed or no? In∣stead of answering me, the judge told the jury, 'They 'might go out.' Some of the jury were not satisfied; whereupon the judge told them, 'They had heard a man 'swear that the oath was tendered to me the last sessions;' and then directed what they should do, I told him, <Q>He
<PB N="192" REF="037441_0708_100D92E023BD42F0"/>should leave the jury to their own consciences.</Q> However, the jury, being put on by him, went forth, and soon after came in again, and found me guilty. I asked them, <Q>How they could satisfy themselves to find me guilty upon that indictment, which was laid so false, and had so many er∣rors in it?</Q> They could make but little answer; yet one who seemed to be the worst of them, would have taken me by the hand: but I put him by, saying, <Q>How now, 'Ju∣das, hast thou betrayed me, and dost thou now come with a kiss?</Q> So I bid him and them repent. Then the judge began to tell me, <Q>How favourable the court had been to me.</Q> I asked him, <Q>How he could say so? Was ever any man worse dealt by than I had been in this case, who was stopped in my journey when travelling upon my law∣ful occasions, and imprisoned without cause; and now had the oaths put to me only for a snare? I desired him to answer me in the presence of the Lord, in whose pre∣sence we all are, whether this oath was not tendered to me in envy?</Q> He would not answer that; but said, <Q>Would you had never come here, to trouble us and the country!</Q> I answered, <Q>I came not thither of myself, but was brought, being stopped in my journey. I did not trouble them, but they had brought trouble upon them∣selves.</Q> Then the judge told me, <Q>What a sad sentence he had to tell me.</Q> I asked him, <Q>Whether what he was going to speak was by way of passing sentence, or for in∣formation? For I told him I had many things to say, and more errors to assign in the indictment, besides those I had already mentioned, to stop him from giving sentence against me upon that indictment.</Q> He said, <Q>He was go∣ing to shew me the danger of a premunire, which was the loss of my liberty and of all my goods and chattels, and to suffer imprisonment during life.</Q> But he said, <Q>He did not deliver this as the sentence of the court upon me, but as an admonition to me.</Q> Then he bid the gaoler <Q>Take me away.</Q> I expected to have been called again to hear the sentence; but when I was gone, the Clerk of the peace (whose name was Twittey) asked him, as I was informed, <Q>Whether that which he had spoken to me should stand-for sentence?</Q> And he, consulting with some of the justices, told him, 'Yes, that was the sentence, and should stand' This was done behind my back, to save himself from shame in the face of the country. Many of the justices, and the generality of the people, were moderate and civil; and
<PB N="193" REF="037441_0709_100D92E25777C060"/>John Ashley, a lawyer, was very friendly both the time be∣fore and now, speaking on my behalf, and pleading the errors of the indictment for me; but justice Street, the judge of the court, would not regard, but over-ruled all. This jus∣tice Street said to some friends in the morning before my trial, <Q>That if he had been upon the bench the first sessions, he would not have tendered me the oath; but if I had been convicted of being at a conventicle, he would have proceeded against me according to that law; and that he was sorry that ever I came before him;</Q> yet he maliciously tendered the oath to me in the court again, when I was to have tried my traverse upon the indictment. But the Lord pleaded my cause, and met with both him and justice Simp∣son, who first ensnared me with the oath at the first sessions; for Simpson's son was arraigned not long after at the same bar for murder. And Street, who, as he came down from London, after the judges had returned me back from the King's Bench to Worcester, said, <Q>Now I was returned to them, I should lie in prison and rot;</Q> had his daughter (whom he so doted on that she was called his idol) brought dead from London in an herse to the same inn where he spoke those words, and brought to Worcester to be buried within a few days after. People took notice of the hand of God, how sudden it was upon him; but it rather hardened than tendered him, as his carriage afterwards shewed.</P>
<P>After I was returned to prison, several came to see me; amongst others, the earl of Salisbury's son, who was very loving, and troubled that they had dealt so wickedly by me. He staid about two hours with me, and took a copy of the errors of the indictment in writing.</P>
<P>The sessions being now over, and I fixed in prison by a premunire, my wife came out of the north to be with me; and the assizes coming on in the sixth month, the state of my case being drawn up in writing, she and Thomas Lower delivered it to judge Wild. In it was set forth the occasion of my journey, the manner of my being taken and imprison∣ed, the proceedings of the several sessions against me, and the errors in the indictment by which I was premunired. When the judge had read it, he shook his head, and said, <Q>We might try the validity or invalidity of the errors, if we would;</Q> which was all they could get from him.</P>
<P>While I lay in prison, it came upon me to state our prin∣ciple to the king: not with particular relation to my own
<PB N="194" REF="037441_0710_100D92E3E7765350"/>sufferings, but for his better information concerning our principle, and us as a people.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the KING.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE principle of the Quakers is the Spirit of Christ, who died for us, and is risen for our justification; by which we know we are his. He dwelleth in us by his Spirit, and by the Spirit of Christ we are led out of un∣righteousness and ungodliness. It brings us to deny all plottings and contrivings against the king, or any man. The Spirit of Christ brings us to deny all manner of un∣godliness, as lying, theft, murder, adultery, fornication, all uncleanness, debauchery, malice, hatred, deceit, co∣zening and cheating whatsoever, and the devil and his works. The Spirit of Christ brings us to seek the peace and good of all men, and to live peaceably, and leads us from such evil actions as the magistrate's sword takes hold upon. Our desire and labour is, that all who profess themselves Christians may walk in the Spirit of Christ; that they through the Spirit may mortify the deeds of the flesh, and by the sword of the Spirit may cut down sin and evil in themselves. Then the judges and other ma∣gistrates would not have so much work in punishing sin in the kingdom; neither then need kings or princes fear any of their subjects, if they all walked in the Spirit of Christ, for the fruits of the Spirit are love, righteousness, good∣ness, temperance, &amp;c. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that profess themselves Christians did walk in the Spirit of Christ, and by it did mortify sin and evil, it would be a great ease to the ma∣gistrates and rulers, and would free them from a great deal of trouble, for it would lead all <Q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them,</Q> and so the royal law of liberty would be fulsilled. For if all called Christians did walk in the Spirit of Christ, by it to have the evil spi∣rit and its fruits mortified and cut down in them, then, not being led by the evil spirit, but by the good Spirit of Christ, the fruits of the good Spirit would appear in all. For as people are led by the good Spirit of Christ, it leads them out of sin and evil, which the magistrate's sword takes hold of, and so would be an ease to the magistrates. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t as people err from this good Spirit of Christ, and fol∣low the evil spirit, which leads them into sin and evil; that spirit brings the magistrate into a great deal of trou∣ble,
<PB N="195" REF="037441_0711_100D7F95CE5098B8"/>to execute the law upon the sinners and transgressors of the good Spirit. That Spirit, which leads people from all manner of sin and evil, is one with the magistrate's power, and with the righteous law; for the law being ad∣ded because of transgression, that Spirit which leads out of transgression must needs be one with that law which is against transgressors. So that Spirit which leads out of transgression is the good Spirit of Christ, and is one with the magistrates in the higher power, and owns it and them; but that spirit which leads into transgression is the bad spi∣rit, is against the law, against the magistrates, and makes them a great deal of troublesome work. The manifesta∣tion of the good Spirit is given to every man to profit with∣al; and no man can prosit in the things of God but by the Spirit of God, which brings to deny all sin and evil. It is said of Israel, Nehem. ix. <Q>The Lord gave them his good Spirit to instruct them, yet they rebelled against it.</Q> If all people did mind this manifestation of the Spi∣rit which God hath given to instruct them, it would lead them to forsake all manner of sin and evil, enmity, hatred, malice, unrighteousness and ungodliness, and to mortify it. Then in the Spirit of Christ they would have fellow∣ship and unity, which is the bond of peace; then would love and peace, which are the fruits of the good Spirit, flow among all that are called Christians.</P>
<P>We are a people, who, intenderness of conscience to the command of Christ and his apostle, cannot swear; for we are commanded in Matth. v. and James v. to keep to Yea and Nay, and <Q>not to swear at all; neither by hea∣ven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath, lest we go into evil, and fall into condemnation.</Q> The words of Christ are these: <Q>Ye have heard that it hath been said by (or to) them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy∣self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths.</Q> These were true and solemn oaths, which those who made ought to have performed in old time; but these Christ and his apostle forbad in the gospel-times, as well as false and vain oaths. If we could take any oath at all, we could take the oath of allegiance, knowing that king Charles was by the power of God brought into England, and set up king of England, &amp;c. over the heads of our old persecutors; and as for the pope's supremacy, we utterly deny it. And the apostle having commanded us not to swear, but to keep to Yea and Nay, we dare not break their commands;
<PB N="196" REF="037441_0712_100D92E9239A5D58"/>therefore many knowing this have put the oaths to us as a snare, that they might make a prey of us. Our denying to swear is not in wilfulness, stubbornness, or contempt, but only in obedience to the command of Christ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apostle; and we are content, if we break our Yea and Nay, to suffer the same penalty as they should that break their oaths. We desire therefore that the king would take this into consideration, also how long we have suffered in this case. This is from one who desires the eternal good and prosperity of the king and of all his subjects in the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>About this time I had a sit of sickness, which brought me very low and weak in my body; and I continued so a pretty while, insomuch that some friends began to doubt of my recovery, I seemed to myself to be amongst the graves and dead corpses; yet the invisible power did secretly sup∣port me, and conveyed refreshing strength into me, even when I was so weak that I was almost speechless. One night, as I was lying awake upon my bed in the glory of the Lord which was over all, it was said unto me, <Q>That the Lord had a great deal more work for me to do for him, before he took me to himself.</Q></P>
<P>Endeavours were used to get me released, at least for a time till I should grow stronger; but the way of effecting it proving difficult and tedious (for the king was not willing to release me by any other way than a pardon, being told he could not legally do it; and I was not willing to accept of a pardon, which he would readily have given me, because I did not look upon that way as agreeable with the innocence of my cause) Edward Pitway, having occasion to speak with justice Parker upon business, desired him to give or∣der to the gaoler, That, in regard of my weakness, I might have liberty to go out of the gaol into the city. Whereup∣on justice Parker wrote the following letter to the gaoler, and sent it to the friend to deliver.</P>

<P>After this, my wise went to London, and spoke to the king; <Q>laying before him my long and unjust imprison∣ment, with the manner of my being taken, and the justices proceedings against me, in tendering me the oath as a snare, whereby they had premunired me: so that I being now his prisoner, it was in his power and at his pleasure to release me; which she desired.</Q> The king spoke kindly to her, and referred her to the lord keeper; to whom she went, but could not obtain what she desired; for he said, <Q>The king could not release me otherwise than by a par∣don;</Q> and I was not free to receive a pardon, knowing I had not done evil. If I would have been freed by a par∣don, I needed not have laid so long; for the king was willing to have given me one long before; and told Tho∣mas Moore, <Q>That I need not scruple being released by a pardon, for many a man that was as innocent as a child had had a pardon granted him:</Q> yet I could not consent to accept one. For I had rather have lain in prison all my days, than come out in any way dishonourable to truth: wherefore I chose to have the validity of my indictment tried before the judges. Having first the opinion of a counsellor upon it (Thomas Corbet of London, whom Richard Davis of Welchpool was well acquainted with, and recommended to me) an Habeas Corpus was sent to Worcester, to bring me up once more to the King's Bench bar, for the trial of the errors in my indictment. The un∣der-sheriff set forward with me the fourth of the twelfth month, there being also in the coach the clerk of the peace, and some others. The clerk had been my enemy all along, and now sought to ensnare me in discourse; but I saw, and shunned him. He asked me, <Q>What I would do with the errors in the indictment?</Q> I told him, <Q>They should be tried, and every action should crown itself.</Q> He quarrel∣led with me for calling their ministers priests. I asked him, 'If the law did not call them so?' He asked me, <Q>What I thought of the church of England? Were there no Christians among them?</Q> I said, <Q>They are all called so, and there are many tender people amongst them.</Q> We
<PB N="198" REF="037441_0714_100D92ECF623A268"/>came to London the eighth of the twelfth month, and the eleventh I was brought before the four judges at the King's Bench, where counsellor Corbet started a new plea. He told the judges, <Q>They could not imprison any man upon a premunire.</Q> Whereupon the chief justice Hale said, <Q>Mr. Corbet, you should have come sooner, at the begin∣ning of the term, with this plea.</Q> He answered, <Q>We could not get a copy of the return and the indictment.</Q> The judge replied, <Q>You should have told us, and we would have forced them to have made a return sooner.</Q> Then said judge Wild, <Q>Mr. Corbet, you go upon general terms; and if it be so as you say, we have committed ma∣ny errors at the Old Bailey, and in other courts.</Q> Corbet was positive that by law they could not imprison upon a premunire. The judge said, <Q>There is summons in the statute.</Q> 'Yes,' said Corbet, <Q>but summons is not impri∣sonment, for summons is in order to a trial.</Q> 'Well,' said the judge, <Q>we must have time to look in our books, and consult the statutes.</Q> So the hearing was put off till next day.</P>
<P>The next day they chose rather to let this plea fall, and begin with the errors of the indictment; and when they came to be opened, they were so many and gross, that the judges were all of opinion the <Q>indictment was quashed and void, and that I ought to have my liber∣ty.</Q> There were that day several great men, lords and others, who had the oaths of allegiance and supremacy tendered to them in open court, just before my trial came on; and some of my adversaries moved the judges that the oaths might be tendered again to me, telling them, 'I was a dangerous man to be at liberty.' But judge Hale said, <Q>He had indeed heard some such reports, but he had also heard many more good reports of me;</Q> so he, with the rest of the judges, ordered me to be freed by proclama∣tion. Thus after I had suffered imprisonment a year and almost two months for nothing, I was fairly set at liberty upon a trial of the errors of my indictment, without receiv∣ing any pardon, or coming under any obligation or en∣gagement at all; and the Lord's everlasting power went over all, to his glory and praise. Counsellor Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bet got great same by it; many of the lawyers told him, <Q>He had brought that to light which had not been known before, as to the not imprisoning upon a premunire;</Q> and after the trial a judge said to him, <Q>You have obtained a great
<PB N="199" REF="037441_0715_100D92EF0314BDF8"/>deal of honour by pleading George Fox's cause so in court.</Q></P>
<P>During the time of my imprisonment in Worcester (not∣withstanding my want of health, and being so often hurried to and fro to London and back) I wrote several books for the press, one whereof was called, <Q>A warning to En∣gland;</Q> another was, <Q>To the Jews, proving by the pro∣phets, that the Messiah is come;</Q> another, <Q>Concerning inspiration, revelation, and prophecy;</Q> another, <Q>Against all vain disputes;</Q> another, <Q>For all bishops and minis∣ters to try themselves by the scriptures;</Q> another. <Q>To such as say, We love none but ourselves;</Q> another, inti∣tuled, 'Our testimony concerning Christ;' and another little book 'concerning Swearing,' being the first of those two given to the parliament. Besides these, I wrote many papers and epistles to friends, to encourage and strengthen them in their services for God, which some (who made pro∣fession of truth, but had given way to a seducing spirit, and were departed from the unity and fellowship of the gos∣pel, in which friends stand) endeavoured to discourage them from; especially in their diligent and watchful care for the well-ordering and managing the affairs of the church of Christ.</P>
<P>Being at liberty, I visited friends in London; and having been very weak, and not yet well recovered, I went to Kingston; and having visited friends there, returned to London, wrote a paper to the parliament, and sent several books to them. A great book against swearing had been delivered to them a little before; the reasonableness where∣of had so much influence, that it was thought they would have done something towards our relief if they had sat lon∣ger. I staid in and near London till the yearly meeting, to which friends came from most parts of the nation, and some from beyond sea. A glorious meeting we had in the everlasting power of God.</P>
<P>This meeting over, and the parliament risen (who had done nothing for nor against friends) I was clear of my ser∣vice for the Lord at London. And having taken my leave of friends there, and had a glorious meeting with some of them at John Elson's in the morning, I set forward with my wise and her daughter Susan by coach (for I was not able to travel on horseback) towards the north, many friends accompanying us as far as Highgate, and some to Danstable, where we lodged that night. We visited friends and were
<PB N="200" REF="037441_0716_100D93BA0803D1A0"/>visited by them at Newport-Pagnel, Northampton, and Cossel, where, amongst others, came a woman, and brought her daughter for me to see how well she was; putting me in mind, <Q>That when I was there before, she had brought her to me much troubled with the king's evil, and had then desired me to pray for her.</Q> Which I did, and she mended upon it; praised be the Lord! From Cossel we went by John Simcock's and William Gandy's to Warring∣ton, Preston and Lancaster.</P>
<P>I had not been at Lancaster since I was carried prisoner from thence by the under-sheriff and gaoler, towards Scar∣borough castle in Yorkshire. I found the town full of peo∣ple; for it was fair-time, and the trained bands were met upon a general muster. Many friends were also in town from several parts of the county, because the quarterly meet∣ing was to be there next day. I staid two nights and a day at Lancaster, and visited friends both at their men's and women's meetings, which were very full, large, and peace∣able; for the Lord's power was over all, and none meddled with us. Here met us Thomas Lower and his wife, Sarah Fell, James Lancaster, and Leonard Fell. The next day after the meeting, the twenty-fifth of the fourth month, we went over the sands, with several other friends to Swarth∣more.</P>
<P>After I had been awhile at Swarthmore, several friends from divers parts of the nation came to visit me, and some out of Scotland; by whom I understood, four young stu∣dents of Aberdeen were convinced there this year, at a dis∣pute held by Robert Barclay and George Keith with some of the scholars of that university.</P>
<P>Among others, colonel Kirby paid me a visit, who had been one of my great persecutors; but now he said he came to bid me welcome into the country, and carried himself in appearance very lovingly; yet before I left Swarthmore he sent for the constables of Ulverstone, and ordered them to tell me, <Q>That we must have no more meetings at Swarth∣more; for if we had, they were commanded by him to break them up, and were to come the next first-day.</Q> That day we had a very precious meeting, the Lord's pre∣sence was wonderful amongst us, and the constables did not come to disturb us. The meetings have been quiet since, and have increased.</P>
<P>The illness I got in my imprisonment at Worcester had so much weakened me, it was long before I recovered my
<PB N="201" REF="037441_0717_100D7FA24B9A8CF0"/>natural strength again. For which reason, and as I had many things lay upon me to write for public and private service, I did not stir much abroad during the time I now staid in the north; but when friends were not with me, spent pretty much time in writing books and papers for truth's service. While I was at Swarthmore, I gave several to be printed; viz.</P>
<P>One, 'Concerning swearing.'</P>
<P>Another, shewing, <Q>That none are successors to the prophets and apostles, but who succeed them in the same power and Holy Ghost that they were in.</Q></P>
<P>Another, shewing, <Q>That possession is above profession; and how the professors now do persecute Christ in spirit, as the professing Jews did persecute him outwardly in the days of his flesh.</Q></P>
<P>Another little book, 'To the magistrates of Dantzick.'</P>
<P>Another, called, <Q>Cain against Abel; or, An answer to the New-England men's laws.</Q></P>
<P>Another, 'To friends at Nevis, concerning watching.'</P>
<P>Another, 'A general epistle to all friends in America.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning Caesar's due, and God's due, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning ordering of families.'</P>
<P>Another, intituled, 'The spiritual man judgeth all things.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning the higher power.'</P>
<P>Besides these, I wrote several epistles to friends, both in England and beyond the seas; and answers to divers papers concerning the <Q>running out of some who had opposed the order of the gospel,</Q> had stirred up a great deal of strife and contention in Westmoreland. Wherefore I was moved to write a few lines particularly to friends there.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>This is for friends in Westmoreland:</HEAD>
<P>ALL live in the power of God, in his light and Spirit, which did first convince you; that in it ye may keep in the ancient unity, in humility, in the fear of the Lord, and his gentle and peaceable wisdom, which is easy to be intreated. That in the same power, light, and Spirit of God, ye may be serviceable in your men's and women's meetings, in the possession of the gospel-order; which gospel, the power of God, hath brought life and immor∣tality to light; that in this ye may see over him that hath darkened you. In this power no apostates can come; for the power of God was before apostates were, or the fall of
<PB N="202" REF="037441_0718_100D92F12ABA7230"/>man and woman was, or the devil either, and will be when he is gone. Therefore praise God in the eternal fellowship of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, which is not of man, nor by man. And all friends in West moreland, keep in the power of God, which will and must preserve and cover you, if ye be preserved. Let your faith stand in the power of God, and not in the wisdom of men's words, lest ye fall. In God's power ye have peace, life, and unity; and for want of keeping in God's power, in his righteousness and Holy Ghost, is all this strife come among you.</P>

<P>I also wrote the following general epistle to friends at the yearly meeting in London:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord hath preserved by his eternal pow∣er to this day, over and through many troubles, storms, tempests, and prisons. Let every one's faith stand in the power of God, which is over the devil, and was be∣fore him. Your faith standing in the invisible power of God, it stands in that which does not change; and the faith that Christ Jesus, the power of God, is the author of, must stand in the power of God, so then it stands in that which is over all, in which they are established. This the apostle brought the church, the true Christians, to: and so ought all the true Christians faith now, which Christ is the author of, to stand in the power of God, in which the everlasting kingdom stands. As every one's faith stands in this power, it keeps all in the power of godliness.</P>
<P>For as it was in the days of the apostles, when some were crying up Paul and Apollos, and so forth, he judged them as carnal; and exhorted and admonished them that their faith should not stand in men, nor in the words of man's wisdom, but in the power of God. He said, <Q>He would not know the speech of them, but the power amongst them, for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in pow∣er.</Q> So it is to be now. Every one's faith must stand in the power of God, and not in men, nor their speeches upon the good words. For we have seen by experience, when they begin to cry up men, and their faith stands in them; such as would have people's faith to stand in them, love popularity, and bring not people's faith to stand in
<PB N="203" REF="037441_0719_100D92F462F858C8"/>the power of God. Such cannot exalt Christ; and when such fall, they draw a great company after them. There∣fore the apostle would not know such after the flesh, but them that were in the power and Spirit; and struck down every one's faith that stood in the words of man's wisdom, that they might stand in the power of God. So it must be now. They whose faith doth not stand therein, cannot exalt his kingdom, that stands in power; therefore every one's faith must stand in the power of God.</P>
<P>The apostle denied popularity, when he judged the Corinthians for looking at Paul and Apollos, to be car∣nal: such are carnal still. Therefore all should know one another in the Spirit, life, and power, and look at Christ; this keeps all in humility. They, whose faith stands in men, will make sects; as in the days of J. N. J. P. and others. The faith of such, Christ is not the author of; if he hath been, they have erred from it, and made ship∣wreck of it. All that are in the true faith, that stands in the power of God, will judge them as carnal, and judge down that carnal part in them, that cries up Paul or Apollos; that their faith may stand in the power of God, and that they may exalt Christ, the author of it. For every one's eye ought to be to Jesus, and every just man and woman may live by their faith, which Christ is the author and finisher of. By this faith every man may see God, who is invisible; which faith gives the victory, and thereby he hath access to God. So every one's faith and hope standing in the power of God, therein all have uni∣ty, victory, and access to God's throne of grace; in which faith they please God. By this faith they are saved, obe∣tain the good report, and subdue all the mountains be∣twixt them and God.</P>
<P>This power hath preserved friends over their persecu∣tors, over the wrath of men, above the spoiling of their goods, and imprisonments; as seeing God, that <Q>created all, gives the increase of all, and upholds all by his word and power.</Q> Therefore let every one's faith be in his power. In this no schism nor sect can come, for it is over them, before they were, and will be when they are gone. But perfect unity is in the truth, in the Spirit, that cir∣cumciseth the body of death, puts off the sins of the flesh, and plunges it down with the Spirit. In the Spirit of God there is perfect fellowship; and Christ is the minister of this circumcision and baptism.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="037441_0720_100D92F5F8A97670"/>
This is upon me from the Lord to write unto you, that every one of you, whose faith Jesus is the author of, may stand in the power of God. From the Lord I warn you, and all every where of the same; for if a star should fall, which has been a light, either the earth or the sea does receive it: that is, the earthly mind, or the foaming, raging people: though neither the seed, light, power, nor truth ever fell, nor the faith itself, the gift of God; but men going from it, become unsavoury.</P>
<P>Adam, whilst he kept in truth, and obeyed the com∣mand of God, was happy; but when he disobeyed the Lord, he sell under the power of Satan, and became un∣happy, though he might talk after of his experiences in pa∣radise; but he had lost his image, and his power and do∣minion, that God created him in.</P>
<P>The Jews, after they received the law, as long as they kept the law of God, which was just, holy, good, and per∣fect, it kept them good, just, holy, and savoury; but when they turned their backs on the Lord, and forsook his law, they came under the power of darkness, under the powers of the earth, and were trodden under as unsavoury.</P>
<P>The Christians were called a <Q>city set on a hill, the light of the world, and the salt of the earth;</Q> but when they forsook the power of God, and their faith stood in words and men, and not in the power; then their walls fell down, though the power in itself stood; and they lost their hill, their saltness, and their shining, And as Chris∣tendom now confesseth, they are not in the same power and spirit the apostles were in, so not in the same salt, nor up∣on the same hill. So they came to be trod under, and the beast, the whore, and the false prophet are uppermost, the unsavoury. Their dead faith is in men, and in words; therefore they are full of sects, and one against another.</P>
<P>And now th e everlasting gospel, the power of God, is preached again, which was before the devil was, that dar∣kened man; and by this power of God life and immortali∣ty is come to light again; therefore every one's faith is to stand in this power that hath brought life and immortality to light in them, and so to be heirs of the power of God, the gospel. Herein all have a right to the power of God, which is the authority of men's and women's meetings, and of all other meetings set up thereby.</P>
<P>As the gospel is preached again, if your faith doth not stand in the power, but in men, and in the wisdom of
<PB N="205" REF="037441_0721_100D92F805FA0B68"/>words, you will grow carnal; and such are for judgment, who cry up Paul or Apollos, and not Christ, the author of your faith. Those that love to be popular would have people's faith stand in them; such do not preach Christ, but themselves. But such as preach Christ and his gospel would have every man and woman to be in the possession of it, and every man and woman's faith to stand in Christ, the author of it, and in the power of God, in which, as their faith stands, nothing can get betwixt them and God; for if any should fall amongst us, as too many have done, that leads its followers either into the waters or into the earth.</P>
<P>If any should go from the spirit of prophecy, that did open them, and from the power, they may speak those ex∣periences the power opened to them formerly. So might Adam and Eve speak of what they saw and enjoyed in pa∣radise; so might Cain and Balaam, of what they saw; and also the Jews, Corah, and Dathan, who praised God on the banks, saw the victory over Pharaoh, ate of the man∣na, drak of the rock, came to mount Sinai, and saw the glory of the Lord. So might the false apostles speak of their experiences, and all those false Christians that turned from the apostles and Christ. So may such do now, that err from the Spirit, that are come out of spiritual Egypt and Sodom, and have known the raging of the Sodomites, as Lot did the outward; and the pursuit of the spiritual Egyptians, as the outward Jew did the outward Egypti∣ans; yet if they do not walk in the Spirit of God, in the light, and in the grace, which keeps their hearts establish∣ed, their words seasoned, and their faith in the power of God, in which the kingdom stands, they may go forth like the false Christians, like the Jews, like Adam and Eve, Cain, Corah, and Balaam and be wandering stars, trees without fruit, wells without water, and clouds with∣out rain; and so come to be unsavoury, trodden down, and as Adam who lost paradise, and the Jews who lost the Holy Land, not walking in the law, and keeping the command of God; and as the Christians who lost the ci∣ty, the hill, the salt, and the light, since the apostles days, and came to be unsavoury, and to be trodden under foot of men.</P>
<P>Therefore let every one's faith stand in the Lord's pow∣er, which is over all, through which they may be built up∣on the rock, the foundation of God, the seed Jesus Christ.
<PB N="206" REF="037441_0722_100D92FA91CB11A8"/>So all in Christ may be ever fresh and green; for he is the green tree that never withers, all are fresh and green that are grafted in him, abide in him, and bring forth heavenly fresh fruits to the praise of God. And tho' Adam and Eve fell from paradise, the Jews fell from the law of God, many of the Christians fell form their prophecies, erred from the faith, the Spirit, and the grace; and the stars have fallen, as was spoken in the Revelations; yet the Spi∣rit, grace, faith, and power of God remains.</P>
<P>Many such states have I seen within these twenty-eight years; though there is a state that shall never fall, nor be deceived, in the Elect before the world began, who are come to the end of the prophecies, and are in him, where they end, renewed up into the image of God (by Christ) which man was in before he fell; in that power, where he had dominion over all that God made; and not only so, but <Q>attain to a perfect man, unto the measure of the sta∣ture of the fulness of Christ,</Q> who never fell. In him is the sitting down in life eternal, where their feet stand sure and fast in the gospel, his power. Here their bread is sure; and he that eats this bread lives for ever.</P>
<P>And all friends and brethren, that declare God's eternal truth and word of life, live in it, be seasoned with grace, and salted with the heavenly salt, that your lives and con∣versations may preach wherever you come; that there be no rawness, nor no quenching of the Spirit, nor despising prophecy either in men or women. For all mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meet in the saith that Jesus is the author of, and in the light that comes from him, and be so grafted into the life, that your knowledge may be there one of another in Christ, and that there may be none slothful, nor sitting down in earthly things, minding them, like Demas of old, lest you clothe yourselves with another clothing than you had at first; but all keep chaste, for the chaste follow the Lamb.</P>
<P>And friends that are ministers, possess as if ye did not; be married as if ye were not; be loose to the world in the Lord's power; for God's oil will be atop of all visible things, which makes his lamps burn, and give light afar off. Let none strive nor covet to be rich in this world, in these changeable things that will pass away; but let your saith stand in the Lord God, who changes not, created all, and gives the increase of all.</P>
<P>Now friends, concerning faithful men and women's meetings, which were set up in God's counsel, whoever
<PB N="207" REF="037441_0723_100D92FCB1867780"/>oppose them, oppose the power of God, which is the au∣thority of them. They are no ministers of the gospel, nor of Christ, that oppose his power, which all are to possess. For the true ministers of Christ, that preach his gospel (which is to be preached to all nations) as deceit is gone over all nations, and all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and she hath them in her cage, her unclean power from the beast and dragon, out of the power of God, and out of truth and the Spirit of God, the apostles were in; the power of God must come over all this again; and all true ministers, that preach the gospel, must bring people into the possession of it again. I say, whosoever preaches the gospel of Christ and him to people and nations, those people and nations receiving the gospel, they receive the power of God, that brings life and immortality to light in them; and they see over the devil that hath darkened them, and the beast, the whore, and her cage. So by the pow∣er of God, life and immortality is brought to light in them; then these men and women, being heirs of this pow∣er, the gospel, are heirs of authority and power over the devil, beast, whore, and dragon.</P>
<P>It is their possession and portion, and they are to labour in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir possession and portion, to do God Almighty's besness and service in the possession of the power of God, the gospel, which is a joyful, glorious, everlasting order. Here is the authority o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>our men's and women's meetings, and other meetings in the name of Jesus, the gospel of Christ, the power of God, which is not of man, nor by man. In this are all to meet, and to worship God. By this are all to act, and in this have all fellowship, a joyful fellowship, a joyful and comfortable assembly. All faith∣ful men and women in every country, city, and nation, whose faith stands in the power of God, the gospel of Christ, who have received the gospel, and are in the pos∣session thereof, have all right to the power in these meet∣ings, for they are heirs of the power, which is the authori∣ty of the men's and women's meetings.</P>
<P>So here is God's choice (and not man's) by his power, of his heirs; and they have all freedom therein to go to the meetings, the men to the men's, and the women to the women's, for they are heirs of the power, which is receiv∣ed in the Holy Ghost; and they see over enmity, and be∣fore it was, by the light, the life, and immortality, which is brought to light in them.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="037441_0724_100D92FE5001C740"/>
The devil, the author of enmity, cannot get into this authority, power, order, nor fellowship of the gospel, nor life, nor light, nor into the unity of the faith, which gives victory over him that hath separated man from God. In∣to the unity of this faith the serpent cannot come, nor into the worship of God in spirit and truth the devil cannot come, nor any enmity. And they that are in this, are in unity over him. Therefore, let every one's faith stand in the power of God, the glorious gospel; all walk as be∣comes the gospel and the order of it. As every one hath received Christ Jesus, the Lord, so walk in him, and let him be their Lord and orderer. For the preaching of the gospel of Christ Jesus is to the intent that all might come to be heirs of the gospel, into the possession of it, to be heirs of Christ and of his government, to the increase of which there is no end; who is over all in his righteous∣ness, and over all in his light, life, power, and dominion. Therefore know one another in his power, his gospel; know one another in Christ Jesus, who is able to restore man out of the state of the fall into the image of God, and into that power and dominion that man had before he fell, and into himself, that never fell, whence they shall go no more forth. Here is the rock and foundation of God that stands sure.</P>
<P>And, friends, be tender to the tender principle of God in all. Shun the occasion of vain disputes and janglings, both amongst yourselves and others; for that many times is like a blustering wind, that hurts and bruises the tender buds and plants. For the world, though they have the words, are out of the life; and the apostle's disputing with them was to bring them to the life. And those dis∣puters among the Christians about genealogies, circum∣cision, the law, meats, drinks, and days, came to be the worst sort of disputers, whom the apostles judged; for such destroyed people from the faith. Therefore did the apostles exhort the churches, that every one's faith should stand in the power of God, and to look at Jesus the author of it. There every graft stands in Christ, the vine, quiet, where no blustering storms can hurt them; there is the safety. There all are of one mind, one faith, one soul, one spirit, baptized into one body with the one spirit, and made all to drink into one spirit, one church, one head, that is heavenly and spiritual: and one faith in this head, Christ, who is the author of it, and hath the glory of it;
<PB N="209" REF="037441_0725_100D930021601CF8"/>one Lord to order all, who is the baptizer into this one body. So Christ hath the glory of his faith out of every man and woman; and the Father through him hath his glory, the Creator of all in his power, the gospel that hath brought life and immortality to light in them; and their faith standing in it, they know the immortal God, serve and worship him in his spirit and in his truth; by which they are made God's free men and women, from him that is out of the truth.</P>
<P>Now, friends, you that have been ancient labourers, and have known the dealings of the Lord these twenty years (more or less) as I have often said to you, draw up what you can of that which the Lord hath carried you through by his power, the passages and sufferings, and how by the Lord ye have been supported from the first; so that he may be exalted by his power now, and in ages to come, who hath been the only support, defence, and stay of his people all along, over all to himself; to whom be all glory and praise for ever and ever. Amen. He de∣serves it in his church throughout all ages, from his living members, who return the praise to the living God, who lives and reigns over all, blessed for ever; who is the life, strength, health, and length of the days of his people. Therefore let there be no boasting, but in the Lord, in his power and kingdom; that keeps all in humility.</P>
<P>And friends, in the Lord's power and truth, what good you can do for friends in prison, or sufferers, by informing or helping them, every one bend yourselves to the Lord's power and spirit, to do his will and his business; and in that all will have a fellow-feeling of one another's condi∣tions in bonds, or in what trials or tribulations soever; you will have a fellow-feeling one of another, having one head, one Lord, and being one body in him. For God's heavenly flail hath brought out his seed, his heavenly plough hath turned up the fallow ground, his heavenly seed is sown by the heavenly man, which brings forth fruits to the heavenly sower, in some fifty, sixty, and an hundred fold in his life-time; and such in the world with∣out end will have life everlasting. Oh! the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fore all keep within; let your lights shine, and your lamps burn, that you may be wells full of the living water, and trees full of the living fruit of God's planting, whose fruit is unto ho∣liness, and end is everlasting life.</P>
<P>The Lord God of power preserve you all in his power.
<PB N="210" REF="037441_0726_100D9301DA8C18C8"/>Let your faith stand therein, that you may have unity in the faith, and in the power; and by this faith and belief you may be all grafted into Christ, the sure root and rock of ages, where the eternal Sun of righteousness shines, in the heavenly and eternal day, upon his plants and grasts, This Sun never goes down, and the heavenly springs of life, and showers are known to water and nourish the grasts, plants, and buds, that they may always be kept fresh and green, and never wither; bringing forth fresh, green, and living fruit, which is offered up to the living God; who is glorified, in that you bear much fruit. The Lord God Almighty keep you, and preserve you all in his power, light, and life, over death and darkness; that therein you may spread his truth abroad, and be valiant for it upon the earth, answering that of God in all; that with it the minds of people may be turned to God, so that with it they may come to know Christ Jesus in the new cove∣nant, in which the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as the waters do the sea. His life must go over death, his light must go over darkness, and the power of God must go over the power of Satan.</P>
<P>So all you that are in the light, life, and power, keep the heavenly fellowship in the heavenly power, the hea∣venly unity in the heavenly divine faith, and the unity of the spirit, which is the bond of the heavenly Prince of Princes peace; who bruises the head of the enemy, the adversary, and reconciles man to God, and all things in heaven and earth. A blessed reconciliation! Let every one's faith stand in the power of God, which Jesus Christ is the author of; that all may know their crown of life. For all outward things, without the substance, the life, the power, are as the husk without the kernel, and do not nourish the immortal soul, nor the new-born Babe; but that which it is nourished by, is the milk of the word, whereby it groweth in the heavenly life, strength, and wisdom. The gospel is not of man, nor by man, but is the power of God, and answers the truth in all: all the possessors of it are to see that all walk according to it; which everlasting order is ordained of God already, and all the possessors of him possess their joy, their comfort, and salvation. My love unto you all, with him that reigns, and is over all, from everlasting to everlasting.</P>
<P>Dwell in the love of God, which passeth knowledge, and edifieth the living members of the body of Christ;
<PB N="211" REF="037441_0727_100D9305F09A4E78"/>which love of God you come to be built up in, and in the holy faith. This love of God brings you to <Q>bear all things, endure all things, and hope all things.</Q> From this love, which you have in Christ Jesus, nothing will be able to separate you, neither powers, nor principalities, heights nor depths, things present nor things to come, prisons nor spoiling of goods, death nor life. The love of God keeps above all that which would separate from God, and makes you more than conquerors in Christ Je∣sus. Therefore in this dwell, that with the same love you may love one another, and all the workmanship of God; that you may glorify God with your bodies, souls, and spirits, which are the Lord's.

<P>Friends, take heed of speaking the things of God in the words that men's wisdom hath taught; for those words will lift up the foolish, that err from the Spirit of God; which words and wisdom are for condemnation, and that which is lifted up by them, and they that thereby speak the things of God in them.

<P>And, friends, I desire that you may all keep the holy order, which is in the gospel, the glorious order in the power of God, which the devil is out of; which was be∣fore all his orders were, and before the world made any.</P>
<P>This joyful order keeps all hearts pure to God, in ever∣lasting peace, unity, and order; feel it, and keep it, both men and women, and come to be heirs of the gospel, which brings life and immortality to light, and to see over that power of darkness, by him who was before the power of death was.

There hath been some scruple about men's and women's meetings: men and women in the gospel are heirs of the power, which was before the devil was; heirs of this, then enter into the possession of it, and do the Lord's business therein. Every one take care of God's honour, and keep all things in righteousness and holiness, which becomes God's house. In that, which honours the Lord God, it eased me, when those meetings were set up for men and women, who are heirs of the gospel, and have right to the gospel order. Then take your possessions, practise in it, be not talkers only, but live and walk in the gospel, the power of God, which is the authority of your meet∣ings.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>During this time, I collected together as many as I could of the epistles I had wrote in former years to friends. I made a collection too of the several papers I had wrote to Oliver Cromwel and his son Richard, in the time of their protectorships, and to the parliaments and magistrates, in their times. I collected also the papers I had wrote to king Charles the Second since his return, and to his council and parliaments, and the justices or other magistrates under him. I made another collection of certificates, which I had received from divers governors of places, judges, justices, parliament-men, and others, for the clearing of me from many slanders, which the envious priests and professors, both here and beyond sea, had cast upon me. This I did for the truth's sake, knowing that their design in slandering me was to defame the truth published by me, and hinder the spreading thereof amongst the people. Besides these, I made two books of collections; one was, a list or cata∣logue of the names of those friends who went out of the north of England, when truth first broke forth there, to proclaim the day of the Lord through this nation. The other was of the names of those friends that went first to preach the gospel in other nations, countries, and places, in what years, and to what p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts they went.</P>
<P>I made another collection, in two books; viz. one of
<PB N="213" REF="037441_0729_100D930A04DFB610"/>epistles and letters from friends and others, on several occa∣sions, to me; the other of letters of mine to friends and others.</P>
<P>I wrote also a book of the types and figures of Christ, with their significations; and many other things, which will be of service to truth and friends in time to come.</P>
<P>I took notice also of those who had run out from truth, drawn others out after them, and turned against truth and friends, since the first breaking forth of truth in this latter age, and what became of them; noting particularly the re∣pentance and return of such of them as came back to truth again. Some ran quite out, and never returned, but were cut off in their gainsaying and rebellion; for the word and power of God hath blasted, and is blasting them, and the holy seed hath ground, and is grinding them to pieces. I have observed that they, who have been convinced, and have not lived and walked in the truth, have been the worst enemies to the truth, and done most hurt amongst friends in the truth, and to others. In these I have seen fulfilled what the Lord did long since shew me, <Q>That such would be greater deceivers than all the priests and professors.</Q> For such as came as far as Cain, Balaam, Corah, and Da∣than, who could 'preach Christ,' and say, <Q>They had preached in his name;</Q> such as came to be apostles, and had tasted of the power of Christ, and then turned from it, such could yet speak their old experiences, and have good words like Corah and Balaam; but not keeping in the life and truth, they deceived the hearts of the simple. Such come to be of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>evil, who abode not in the truth; as Cain and all the Jews that abode not in the truth were. For though Cain did sacrifice to God, and did talk with God, and the Jews could talk of Abraham, Moses, and the pro∣phets, yet Christ told them, <Q>They were of their father the devil.</Q> In like manner, though those called Christians can talk of Christ, and use his and his apostles and disciples words, yet not abiding in the truth, power, and spirit the apostles were in, they are of the devil, out of truth, and do his work. So are all those that have been convinced of God's eternal truth since it sprang up in this nation, that have not abode in the light, in the spirit and power of Christ Jesus, but have turned against the power, and have oppos∣ed the work thereof; though they may retain their former experiences, and be able to speak many good words, yet not living in the life and power that gave them those experien∣ces,
<PB N="214" REF="037441_0730_100D930C7939A880"/>they live in the power of darkness, which is of the de∣vil; and by the light and truth both he and they are con∣demned, and must own their condemnation, if ever they come to truth again. For to resist the heavenly power, and to oppose the workings and divine manifestations there∣of through any, is not a light matter. And as I had been moved of the Lord to travel in his power round this nation, and in other parts, to preach the everlasting gospel, and to declare the word of life, which was in the beginning, through many imprisonments, hardships, sufferings, and trials: so I was afterwards moved to travel in the same heavenly power about the nation again (and to write to such places where I came not) to recommend unto friends the <Q>setting up of the quarterly and monthly meetings in all counties, for looking after the poor, taking care for orderly proceed∣ings in marriages, and other matters relating to the church of Christ.</Q> Though some meetings for this end were set∣tled 'in the north of England in the year 1652.</P>
<P>After this also, truth still spreading further over the nation, and friends increasing in number, I was moved by the same eternal power to recommend the setting up women's meet∣ings also, that all, both male and female, who had receiv∣ed the gospel, the word of eternal life, might come into the order of the gospel, brought forth by the power of God, and might act for God in the power, and therein do busi∣ness and service for him in his church. All the faithful must labour in God's vineyard; they being his hired ser∣vants, he having given them the earnest of his Spirit. For a master that hires a servant, and gives him the earnest of his hire, expects he should do his work after he knows his will, in the outward creation; so all God's people that are of the new creation, and have received the earnest of his Spi∣rit, ought to labour with, by, and in his Spirit, power, grace, and faith, in the light, in God's vineyard, that they may have their wages when they have done God's work and business in his day, which is eternal life. But none can labour in his vineyard, and do his work and will, but as they walk in the heavenly divine light, grace, and Spirit of Christ; which hath been, and is my travail and labour in the Lord to turn all to.</P>
<P>Some that professed truth, and had made a great shew thereof, being gone from the simplicity of the gospel into jangling, division, and a sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of separation, endeavoured to discourage friends (especially the women) from their godly
<PB N="215" REF="037441_0731_100D930EB8AE50A0"/>care and watchfulness in the church over one another in the truth; opposing their meetings, which in the power of the Lord were set up for that end and service. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to write the following epistle, and send it among friends, for the discovering of that spirit by which those opposers were acted, its work and way by which it wrought, and to warn friends of it, that they might not be betrayed by it.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>All my dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIVE in the seed of peace, Christ Jesus, in whom ye have life. That spirit, which comes amongst you to raise up strife, is out of Christ; for it is the spirit that is not easy to be intreated, not gentle, so not of the wisdom of God, which is justified of her children. They that follow that spirit are none of wisdom's children. There is a spirit that hath made a separation, and has been against men's and women's meetings; <Q>yet has set up one of their own, which they have given power to; and that none shall sit amongst them but whom they give power to, but shall be looked upon as usurpers of authority.</Q> This spirit and its work is not of God, though it has made a jumble amongst some; and the path it may travel in is through the earthly affections, amongst the unestablished or apostates. But all that are in the life, spirit, light, grace, truth, and power of God, bar it out; and such as sit under their own vine, Christ Jesus, and are grafted into him, have no need of their exhortation or counsel; for the true believers are entered into their rest. Therefore all keep in the gospel of peace, and they that be heirs of the kingdom keep your possession thereof.</P>
<P>Some of this spirit have said to me, <Q>They see no ser∣vice in women's meetings.</Q> My answer is, and hath been to such, If they be blind and without sight, they should not oppose others; for none impose any thing upon them, God never received the blind for a sacrifice, neither can his people. But Christ has enlightened all; and to as many as receive him, he gives <Q>power to become the sons of God.</Q> Such as are heirs of his power, and of his gospel, which brings life and immortality to light, can see over him that has darkened those; and all such keep the order of the Gospel, the power of God, and their meetings therein, which preserves them in life and immortality. These see the great service of men's and women's meetings, in
<PB N="216" REF="037441_0732_100D9310F3679F48"/>the order of the gospel, the power of God; for they are meet-helps in this power, which is the authority of their meetings. I say to all you that be against men's and wo∣men's meetings, who say, <Q>you see no service for the wo∣men's meetings,</Q> and oppose them; you are therein out of the power of God, and his Spirit you live not in. For God saw a service for the assemblies of the women in the time of the law, about those things that appertained to his worship and service, and to the holy things of his taber∣nacle; and they in his Spirit see now their service in the gospel, many things in these meetings being more proper for the women than the men; and they, in the power and wisdom of God, may inform the men of such things as are not proper for them; and the men may inform the women of such things as are not proper for them, as meet-helps to each other. For in the time of the law, the women were to offer as well as the men; so in the time of the gospel they are to offer their spiritual sacrifices; for they are all called, both men and women, a royal priesthood, the household of faith, the living stones, that make up the spiritual building, which Christ is the head of; and are to be encouraged in their labour in the gospel; for all things that both men and women do, are to be done in the power of God. Such as see no service for these women's meetings, or the men's, but oppose them, and make strife among friends, are in the spirit of the world that is against and forbids our other meetings, in the same spirit that hath been and is against women's speaking in meetings, and say, <Q>They must be silent,</Q> &amp;c. though the same apostle commands, <Q>That men should keep silence as well as the women,</Q> if there were not an interpreter. You may see the spirit of the world hath entered such opposers, though they come un∣der another colour; for they would not have us to meet at all. These are against women's meetings, and some of them against men's also, and say, <Q>They see no service for them;</Q> then they may hold their tongues, and not oppose them that do see their service for God in these meetings.</P>
<P>Therefore all you that seel the power of God, and your service for God in them, both men and women, keep your meetings in the power of God, the authority of them, as they were settled in it; then ye will be preserved both over this spirit that opposes them, and over the spirit of the world that opposes your other meetings; for it is all
<PB N="217" REF="037441_0733_100D93129AE90DA8"/>one in the ground, and would bring you into bondage. Such as are out of the peaceable gospel oppose its order; and out of the faith that works by love, out of the wisdom that is gentle, easy, and peaceable, &amp;c. and out of the kingdom that stands in peace and joy. Therefore keep over that spirit that sows discord or dissension, and would draw you from your habitation and possession in the order of the gospel; for it is the same spirit that deceived Adam and Eve, by which they lost their habitation in righteous∣ness and holiness, and their dominion; so that spirit got over them, and it would get over you. One while it will tell you. "It sees no service for your meetings;" and ano∣ther time oppose you. But I say, this is the blind spirit which is out of the power of God, and which the power of God is over. Therefore keep in the power, that ye may stand for your liberty in Christ Jesus, males and fe∣males, heirs of him, of his gospel, and his order. Stand up for your liberty in the gospel, and in the faith, which Christ Jesus hath been the author of; for if ye lose it, and let another spirit get over you, ye will not soon regain it. I knew Satan would bestir himself in his instruments, when men's and women's meetings came to be set up in the power, light, and truth, and the heirs of the gos∣pel to take their possession of it in every county and city, therein to walk, watch over one another, and take care of God's glory and honour, and his precious truth, and to see that all walk in the truth as becomes the gospel, and to see that nothing was lacking; and so whatsoever was decent, modest, virtuous, lovely, comely, righteous, and of good report, to follow after; and to admonish and ex∣hort all that were not faithful, and to rebuke all that did evil. I knew this would give such a check to all loose speakers, talkers, and walkers, that there would be an op∣position against such meetings. But heed it not, truth will come over them all, and is over them all, and faith must have the victory; for the gospel and its order is everlasting, the Seed (Christ) is the beginning and the ending, and will outlast all; the Amen, in whom ye have peace. I say, all that oppose the men's and women's meetings, or that marriages should be laid before them, or the recording of condemnations of sin and evil, or admo∣nishing or exhorting such as walk not in the truth, are of a loose spirit, and their spirits tend to looseness. Let those take them that will; truth will not have them, nor any of
<PB N="218" REF="037441_0734_100D9315B1C24030"/>their sacrifice: for nothing is accepted of God but what is done in truth, and in his Spirit, which is peaceable. The authority of our men's and women's meetings is the power of God; all the heirs of the gospel are heirs of that autho∣rity and dignity; this is of God, and shall answer the wit∣ness of God in all. The greatest opposers of this practice and work are such as have been convinced of God's truth, but have not lived in it. Such were the greatest troublers of the church in Moses's day, and in the days of the apos∣tles; but mark their end, and read what became of them all. Therefore all keep your habitation in the truth, and therein ye may see what became of all the opposers of it for twenty years past: they are all gone, and the truth lives and reigns; the Seed is over all, and all are one in it, in rest, peace, and life everlasting; and therein they sit down together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, the Amen.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>While I was at Swarthmore, died William Lampit, priest of Ulverstone (the parish that Swarthmore is in.) He was an old deceiver, and perverter of the right way of the Lord, and a persecutor of the people of God. Much contest I had with him when I first came into those parts. He had been an old false prophet: for in the year 1652 be prophe∣sied (and said he would wage his life upon it) <Q>that the Qua∣kers would all vanish and come to nought within half a year:</Q> but he came to nought himself. For he continued in his false accusing of God's people till a little before he died, and then cried for a little rest. To one of his hearers, that came to visit him before he died, he said, <Q>I have been a preacher a long time, and thought I had lived well; but I did not think it had been so hard a thing to die.</Q></P>
<P>After I had sinished the services which lay upon me then to do, seeling my spirit drawn towards the south (though I was but weak, and not able to travel far in a day) I left Swarthmore the twenty-sixth of the first month 1677, and went to Thomas Pearson's at Powbank in Westmoreland, where I had a meeting the next day; and from thence to Thomas Camm's at Camm's-gill, whither Robert Widders, with his wife and several other friends came to see me be∣fore I left the country, and to attend the meeting there the
<PB N="219" REF="037441_0735_100D9317B41B0510"/>next day, which was very large, and in which I was largely drawn forth in testimony to the truth. I had much dis∣course with some of that meeting, who were not in unity with the quarterly meeting they belonged to: but after∣wards several of them, that were somewhat tender, came to see their error, and gave forth condemnations against them∣selves. Next day John Blaykling came to Thomas Camm's, to bring me to his house at Drawell in Sedberg in York∣shire; whither I went with him, visiting friends in the way. I staid at Drawell two or three nights, having meetings there and thereabouts: for while I was there, the men's and women's meetings were held, which were very large and precious. The first-day following I had a meeting at Brig-flats, to which most of the friends from the several meetings round, with a great concourse of other people, came; it was thought there were five or six hundred people. A very good meeting it was, wherein truth was largely declared and preciously opened, to the comforting and refreshing the faithful, and the drawing near them that were afar off. I had another meeting at John Blaykling's, where came many friends that were going to the quarterly meeting at Kendal: with them my wife went back (who with her daughter Ra∣chel had accompanied me thus far;) and I, having Leonard Fell with me, passed through Sedberg and Garsdale into Wensydale, visiting friends as we went. At night I reach∣ed Richard Robinson's at Counterside, where several friends came to me that evening; some of whom went with me next day to the widow Tenant's at Scarhouse in Langstroth-dale, whither we had much ado to get, the snow lay so deep, though it was a week in the second month. Here on first-day we had a large meeting, friends coming to it from seve∣ral parts round about; and the Lord gave me a very sea∣sonable testimony to bear amongst them, which I did for several hours, to their great satisfaction and comfort. Thence passing through Bishopsdale, Mildum, Barton, and by Be∣dal and Northallerton, I came to George Robinson's at Burrowby, where also friends coming from several parts, we had a very large and good meeting, and very peaceable. Not long after, an envious justice, hearing I had a great meeting there, troubled friends about is, and made them appear at the sessions, where he asked them many ensnaring questions; for he knew not how to convict them, because he had no proof against them. When he saw his questions did not catch them, he told them, <Q>He had heard that
<PB N="220" REF="037441_0736_100D9319D46DC838"/>George Fox was at a large meeting with them, and they all sat silent, and none spoke in the meeting.</Q> This false story he cunningly feigned, thinking thereby to have drawn some of the friends to have contradicted him, and have said, 'That I had spoke in the meeting;' that he might have convicted them upon their own confession, and have fined them. But friends standing in the wisdom of God, did not answer him according to his desire, and so escaped his snare. But two friends that came out of Ireland having a meeting that evening about three miles off this evil-minded justice got information thereof, and fined friends, and plun∣dered them very sorely for it.</P>
<P>I went from Burrowby to Isaac Lindley's, calling upon friends as I went. Robert Lodge, and some friends with me, next day passed to York; and the day following, being first-day, I was at friends meeting at York, which was large and peaceable. The second day also I staid in York, and had two meetings with friends at John Taylor's, from whence I wrote to my wife, as followeth:</P>

My desires are, that ye all may be preserved in the Lord's everlasting Seed, in whom ye will have life and peace, dominion, and settle∣ment in the everlasting home or dwelling, in the house built upon the foundation of God. In the power of the Lord I am brought to York, having had many meetings in the way. The way was many times deep and bad with snow, our horses sometimes were down, and we were not able to ride; sometimes we had great storms and rain, but by the power of the Lord I went through all. At Scarhouse was a very large meeting, and another at Burrowby, to which friends came out of Cleveland and Bishoprick; and many other meetings we have had. At York yesterday we had a very large meeting, exceedingly thronged, friends being at it from many parts, and all quiet, and friends well satis∣fied: Oh! the glory of the Lord shined over all. This day we had a large men's and women's meeting, many friends, both men and women, and all was quiet. This evening we are to have the men's and women's meeting of the friends of the city. John Whitehead is here, with Robert Lodge and others: friends are mighty glad, above measure. So I am in my holy element, and holy work

So my love in the Fountain of Life, in which as ye all abide ye will have the refreshment of life; that by it ye may grow, and gather eternal strength to serve the Lord, and be satisfied.

<P>Leaving York, I visited friends at Tadcaster, Nottingly, Doncaster, and Balby, having meetings as I went. At Balby I staid the first-day meeting, and went next day to Thomas Stacy's at Ballowfield, where in the evening I had a meeting, to compose a difference that had happened be∣tween some that professed truth, and they were reconciled. Next day I came to Stainsby in Derbyshire, in which coun∣ty I had formerly lived, about the first breaking forth of truth. Here I had a good meeting with friends, and after∣wards passed to Skegby in Nottinghamshire, and from thence to Nottingham, to John Reckless's. I had a meeting with friends at his house that evening, and another the next day in friends publick meeting-house, which was peaceable and well.</P>
<P>I went the day following to John Fox's at Wymeswould in Leicestershire, where I had a meeting that evening: and next day to William Smith's at Sileby, where, it being first-day, we had a very large meeting: for besides friends from several places, many of the town's-people, hearing I was there, came to the meeting, and heard the truth declar∣ed gladly. Next day I went to Leicester, where finding many friends come out of the country, to be at the horse∣fair next day, I had a very good meeting with them that night, and another next evening at William Wells's at Knighton, about a mile from Leicester. Next day I passed to Swanington, and had a meeting there: from thence to Samuel Fretwell's at Hartshorn in Derbyshire, where I had a meeting also; then to Henry Sidon's at Badgely in War∣wickshire, and staid the meeting there, which, being the first-day, was very large and peaceable, notwithstanding a justice had threatened to come and break it up. I went in
<PB N="222" REF="037441_0738_100D931E8052FA30"/>the evening to Richard Baal's of Whittington, where seve∣ral friends came to visit me. Next day I went to Nathani∣el Newton's at Hartshill, where several friends met me, with whom I had good service. After this I passed on, visiting friends in divers places, till I came to Dingley, where a meeting was appointed before, which was very numerous, and truth was largely opened to the people: the meeting was peaceable, and the people generally sober; saving that, while I was shewing how christendom (so called) was gone from the pure religion that is underfiled, &amp;c. a man rushed out in a furious manner, and said, 'I deny that.' After this meeting, I went with Thornas Charles to his house at Adingworth; and next day to Northampton, where I staid the first-day meeting, which was very large and peace∣able. I had much service among friends besides. Next day Edward Cooper of Northampton accompanied me to Olney in Buckinghamshire, where I staid at James Brier∣lie's, several friends coming to see me in the evening. Next day I went to a meeting at Turry in Bedfordshire, to which friends came from several parts. It was a very large meeting. Here I met with William Dewsberry, who after the meet∣ing took me to his son-in-law John Rush's of Kempston, where I staid with William that night and most of the next day; passing thence towards the evening through Ampthill to Thomas Gamboll's of Bullocks-hill. William Dews∣berry went along with me, and several friends came to visit vs. Next day, passing through Luton, I went to Market-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treet, William Dewsberry accompanying me part of the way, and the day following Leonard Fell. I had a meet∣ing at Kensworth, which was pretty large and peaceable; after which we visited friends at Alban's, and next day at South Mims and Barnet. We came that night to the wi∣dow Haly's at Guttershedge in Hendon, Middlesex. Next day, being first-day, we had a very large meeting there, se∣veral friends coming from London. I staid second-day, and the third went to William Mead's house at Highgate, with whom next day I went to London. It being fourth-day, I went to the meeting at Gracechurch-street, where friends and I were greatly refreshed in each other in the Lord, and the Lord's power and Seed was set over all; blessed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>Thus it pleased the Lord to bring me sase to London, tho' much wearied; for tho' I rode not very far in a day, yet thro' weakness of body, continual travelling was hard to
<PB N="223" REF="037441_0739_100D9320DF1C2838"/>me. Besides, I had not much rest a-nights to refresh na∣ture, for I often sat up late with friends where I lodged, to inform and advise them in things wherein they were want∣ing; and when I was in bed, I was often hindered of sleep by great pains in my head and teeth, occasioned, as I thought, by cold I had taken by riding often in the rain. But the Lord's power was over all, and carried me through all, to his praise.</P>
<P>In my journey I observed a slackness and shortness in some that professed truth, in keeping up the ancient testimo∣ny of truth against tithes: for where-ever that spirit got en∣trance which wrought division in the church, and opposed the men's and women's meetings, it weakened those that re∣ceived it in their testimony against tithes. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to give forth an 'Epistle to friends,' to stir up the pure mind in them, and to encourage and strengthen them in their christian testimony against that an∣tichristian yoke of oppression.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE faithful to the Lord in your testimony for Jesus, who hath ended the levitical priesthood of Aaron that took tithes, and sent his ministers to give freely that which they had received of him freely, without a bag or a staff. Christ's disciples could not join with those that made a trade of preaching. And as there was a testimony to be borne against those tithes which were commanded in the law for Levi and Aaron, so there is a testimony to be borne against those tithes which have been set up by man in the dark time of popery, and not set up by God nor Christ. To cry against the priests in words, and yet to give them means, and put into their mouths, that they may not prepare war against you, is a contradiction. Therefore take heed: for if the Lord bless you with out∣ward creatures, and you bestow them upon Baal's priests, he may justly require the outward things from you again which he hath given you; who saith, That his ministers should freely give, as they have freely received. So all the preachers for tithes and money, and the takers and payers of tithe, must be testified against in the Lord's power and Spirit; that all may stand up in their testimo∣ny for Jesus Christ, in his power and spirit, against the tithe-mongers. Consider how many saithful servants and valiants of the Lord have laid down their lives against
<PB N="224" REF="037441_0740_100D93226DFD9328"/>them, in this day of the Lord; and in the days of the martyrs they did witness against them. Consider also what judgments have come upon those that spoiled friends goods, and cast them into prison for tithes and mainte∣nance. Therefore in the power of the Lord maintain the war against the beast, and do not put into his mouth, lest he cry peace to you; which peace you must not receive, but it must be broken and thrown out by the Spirit of God. Then in the same Spirit ye will receive the peace from the Son of peace, which the beast, the whore, and the world, with all their earthly teachers for the earth, made by man, cannot receive nor bereave you of. There∣fore keep your authority and dominion in the power, Spi∣rit, and name of Jesus, in whom is my love to you.</P>

<P>I came to London ten or twelve days before the yearly meeting; in which time I fell in with friends there in the service of truth, visiting them at the meetings. The par∣liament then sitting, we prepared something to lay before them, concerning seizing the third part of friends estates, as Popish recusants; which was a great suffering, and a griev∣ance we complained of; but no redress we got.</P>
<P>To the yearly meeting many friends came from most parts of the nation, and some out of Scotland, Holland, &amp;c. Very glorious meetings we had, wherein the Lord's power∣ful presence was very largely felt, and the affairs of truth were sweetly carried on in the unity of the Spirit, to the satisfaction and comfort of the upright-hearted; blessed be the Lord for ever! After the yearly meeting, having staid a week or two with friends in London, I went with William Penn to his house in Sussex; John Burnyeate and some other friends being with us. As we passed through Surry, hearing the quarterly meeting for the county was that day, William Penn, John Burnyeate, and I went from the road to it; and after the meeting returning to our other com∣pany, went with them to William Penn's that night, which is forty miles from London. I staid at Worminghurst about three weeks, in which time John Burnyeate and I answered a very wicked and envious book, which Roger Williams, a priest of New-England (or some colony thereabouts; had written against truth and friends. When we had finished that service, we went with Stephen Smith to his hous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="225" REF="037441_0741_100D932472A42068"/>Warpledon in Surry, where we had a large meeting. Friends thereaway had been exceedingly plundered about two months before on the priest's account; for they took from Stephen Smith five kine (being all he had) for about fifty shillings tithes. From thence we went to Kingston, and so to London, where I staid not long: for it was upon me from the Lord to go into Holland, to visit friends and to preach the gospel there and in some parts of Germany. Wherefore setting things in order for my journey as fast as I could, I took leave of friends at London, and with several other friends went down to Colchester in Essex, in order to my passage for Holland. Next day, being first-day, I was at the publick meeting of friends there, which was very large and peaceable. In the evening I had another large meeting, but not so publick, at John Furly's house, where I lodged. The day following was the women's meeting, which was also very large. Next day we passed to Har∣wich, where Robert Duncon, and several other friends came to see us; and some from London that intended to go over with me. The packet-boat not being ready, we went to the meeting in the town, and a precious opportu∣nity we had together; for the Lord, according to his wont∣ed goodness, by his overcoming, refreshing power, opened many mouths to declare his everlasting truth, and to praise and glorify him. After the meeting, we returned to John Vandewall's, where I had lodged; and when the boat was ready (taking leave of friends) we that were bound for Hol∣land went on board about the 9th hour in the evening, the 25th of the 5th month, 1677.</P>
<P>The friends that went over with me were William Penn, Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, John Furly and his brother, William Tailcoat, George Watts, and Isabel Yeomans, one of my wife's daughters. About the first hour in the morning we weighed anchor, having a fair, brisk wind, which by the next morning brought us within sight of Holland. But that day proving very clear and calm, we got forward but little till about the fourth hour in the afternoon, when a fresh gale arose, which car∣ried us within a league of land. Then being becalmed, we cast anchor for that night between the hours of nine and ten in the evening. But William Penn and Robert Bar∣clay (understanding Benjamin Furly was come from Rot∣terdam to the Briel to meet us) got two of the boatmen to let down a small boat that belonged to the packet, and
<PB N="226" REF="037441_0742_100D932652F7AEB0"/>row them to shore: but before they could reach it, the gates were shut; and there being no house without the gate, they were fain to lie in a fisher's boat all night. As soon as the gates were opened in the morning, they went in, and found Benjamin Furly, with other friends of Rotterdam, come to receive us; and they sent a boat, with three young men in it, that lived with Benjamin Furly, who brought us to the Briel, where the friends received us with great gladness.</P>
<P>We staid about two hours to refresh ourselves; and then took boat, with the Holland friends, for Rotterdam, where we arrived about the eleventh hour that day, the 28th of the fifth month 1677. I was very well this voyage, but some of the friends were sea-sick. A fine passage we had, and all came safe and well to land; blessed and praised be the name of the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>The next day, being first-day, we had two meetings at Benjamin Furly's, where many of the town's-people and some officers came in, and all were civil. Benjamin Furly or John Claus interpreted, when any friend declared. I spent the next day in visiting friends. The day following, William Penn and I, with other friends, went towards Am∣sterdam, with some of that city, who came to Rotterdam to conduct us thither. We took boat in the afternoon, and, passing by Overkirk, came to Delft, through which we walk∣ed on foot; and then took boat again to Leyden, where we lodged that night at an inn. This is counted six Dutch miles from Rotterdam, which are eighteen English miles, and five hours sail, or travelling; for our boat was drawn by an horse that went on the shore. Next day taking boat again, we went to Harlem, fourteen miles from Leyden, where we had appointed a meeting, which proved very large. Many of the town's-people came in, and two of their preach∣ers. The Lord gave us a blessed opportunity, not only with respect to friends, but to other sober people, and the meeting ended peaceably and well. After meeting we pas∣sed to Amsterdam, accompanied by several friends of that city and of Alkmaer.</P>
<P>Next day was the quarterly meeting at Amsterdam, to which came friends from Harlem, and Rotterdam, and with them those of our company, whom we had left at Rotter∣dam, viz. Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, &amp;c. The meeting was at Gertrude Dirick Nieson's. A very large and serviceable meeting it was. William Penn and I were drawn to open many things concerning the order of
<PB N="227" REF="037441_0743_100D932A07547ED0"/>the gospel, and to shew the benefit and service of yearly, quarterly and monthly meetings of men and women. We had another meeting at Gertrude's the next day, more pub∣lick, and very large, at which were professors of several sorts, unto whom the way of life and salvation was largely and livingly opened; which they hearkened very attentively to, none making any objection to what was declared. In the afternoon we had another meeting in the same place, but less, and more private. The day following we had a meet∣ing of friends only, wherein by joint agreement were settled several meetings, to wit, monthly, quarterly, and a yearly meeting, to be held at Amsterdam for friends in all the United Provinces of Holland, and in Embden, the Palati∣nate, Hamburgh, Frederickstadt, Dantzick, and other pla∣ces in and about Germany; which friends were very glad of, and it hath been of great service to truth.</P>
<P>Next day an exercise came upon me concerning that de∣ceitful spirit which wrought in some to make divisions in the church, and the care of the churches being upon me, I was moved to write a few lines to warn friends of it, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends, keep over that spirit of separation and di∣vision, in the peaceable truth, and in the Seed of life, which will wear it all out, and outlast it. For the Lamb will have the victory over all the spirits of strife, as it hath had since the beginning; and they will wither, as others have done: but all that keep in the Seed, which is always green, shall never wither; as friends have been to this day kept. If any have backslidden, thrown off the cross, grown loose and full, and gone into strife and con∣tention with their earthly spirits, and therein plead for li∣berty, this spirit taketh with loose, earthly spirits, and cries imposition to such as admonish them to come to the life, light, Spirit, and power of God, that they may be made alive, and live again with the living. Upon this ad∣monition their spirits rise into contention, strife, and sepa∣ration, turning against the living, in their loose earthly spirits, which would have the name of truth, but are not in the nature of it, but are for eternal judgment of the liv∣ing Seed. This is it which doth deceive, but it is judged by that which doth undeceive and save.</P>

This being first-day, we had a very large meeting, there coming to it a great concourse of people of several opinions, Baptists, Seekers, Socinians, Brownists, and some of the Collegians. Robert Barclay, George Keith, William Penn and I, did all severally declare the everlasting truth among them; opening the state of man in the fall, and shewing by what way man and woman may come into the restoration by Christ Jesus. The mystery of iniquity and the mystery of godliness were very plainly laid open, and the meeting ended quietly and well.</P>
<P>The day following, George Keith, Robert Barclay, and William Penn, leaving me and some other friends at Am∣sterdam, set forward towards Germany, where they travelled many hundred miles, and had good service for the Lord, Benjamin Furly going with them, and interpreting.</P>
<P>That day and the next I staid at Amsterdam, visiting friends, and assisting them in some business concerning their meetings. Three Baptists came to discourse with me, to whom I opened things to their satisfaction, and they parted from me in kindness. I wrote a letter also to the princess Elizabeth, which Isabel Yeomans delivered to her, when George Keith's wife and she went to visit her.</P>

<P>I HAVE heard of thy tenderness towards the Lord and his holy truth, by some friends that have visited thee, and also by some of thy letters, which I have seen; which indeed is a great thing, for a person of thy quality to have such a tender mind after the Lord and his precious truth, seeing so many are swallowed up with voluptuousness, and the pleasures of this world; yet all make an outward pro∣fession of God and Christ one way or other, but without any deep inward sense and feeling of him. For it is not many mighty nor wise of the world that can become fools for Christ's sake, or can become low in the humility of Christ Jesus from their mighty state, through which they might receive a mightier estate, and a mightier kingdom, through the inwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d holy Spirit, the divine light and power of God; and a mightier wisdom, which is from above, pure and peaceable: which wisdom is above that which is below, that is carthly, sensual, and devilish, by which men des∣troy one another about their religions, ways, worships, and churches: but this they have not from God nor Christ. The wisdom which is from above, by which all things
<PB N="229" REF="037441_0745_100D932E0C6CE0B0"/>were made and created, which the holy fear of God in the heart is the beginning of, keeps the heart clean. By this wisdom are all God's children to be ordered, and with it come to order all things to God's glory. This is the wis∣dom that is justified of her children. In this fear of God and wisdom, my desire is, that thou mayest be preserved to God's glory. For the Lord is come to teach his people himself, and to set up his ensign, that the nations may flow unto it. There hath been an apostacy, since the apos∣tles days, from the divine light of Christ, which should have given them the <Q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus;</Q> and from the Holy Spirit, which would have led them into all truth; and therefore have people set up so many leaders without them, to give them knowledge; and also from the holy and pre∣cious faith which Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of, which faith purisies the heart, and gives victory over that which separates from God; through which faith they have access to God, and in which faith they please God, the mystery of which is held in a pure conscience. And also from the gospel which was preached in the apostle's days (which gospel is the power of God) which brings life and immortality to light in man and woman, by which people should have seen over the devil that has darkened them; which gospel will preserve all them that receive it in life and immortality. For the eyes of people have been after men, and not after the Lord, who doth write his law in the hearts, and puts it into the minds of all the children of the new covenant of light, life, and grace; through which they all come to know the Lord, from the least to the greatest: so that the knowledge of the Lord may cover the earth, as the waters do the sea. This work of the Lord is beginning again, as it was in the apostles days; people shall come to receive an unction in them from the Holy One, by which they shall know all things, and shall not need any man to teach them, but as the anointing doth teach them; and also to know what the righteousness of faith speaks, the word nigh in the heart and mouth to obey it, and to do it. This was the word of faith the apostles preached; which is now received and preached again, and is the duty of all true Christians to receive. So now peo∣ple are coming out of the apostacy, to the light of Christ and his Spirit; to receive faith from him, and not from men; to receive the gospel from him, their unction from
<PB N="230" REF="037441_0746_100D9330075E90F0"/>him, the Word; and as they receive him, they declare him freely, as his command was to his disciples, and is still to the learners and receivers of him. For the Lord God and his Son Jesus Christ is come to teach his people, and to bring them from all the world's ways to Christ the way, the truth, and the life, who is the way to the Father; and from all the world's teachers and speakers to him the speak∣er and teacher, as Heb. i. 1. and from all the world's worshippers, to worship God in the Spirit and in the truth, which worship Christ set up above sixtcen hundred years ago, when he put down the Jews worship at the tem∣ple at Jerusalem, and the worship at the mourtain where Jacob's well was; and to bring people from all the world's religions, which they have made since the apostles days, to the religion that was set up by Christ and his apostles, which is pure and undesiled before God, and keeps from the spots of the world; and to bring them out of all the world's churches and sellowships, made and set up since the apostles days, to the church that is in God, the Fa∣ther of our Lord Jesus Christ, Thess. i. 1. and to bring to the unity and fellowship in the Holy Spirit, that doth mortify, circumcise, and baptize, to plunge down sin and corruption, that has got up in man and woman by trans∣gression. In this Holy Spirit there is holy fellowship and unity; yea, it is the bond of the Prince of Princes, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords peace: which hea∣venly peace all true Christians are to maintain with spiri∣tual weapons, not with carnal.</P>
<P>And now, my friend, the boly men of God wrote the scriptures as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; and all Christendom are on heaps about those scriptures, be∣cause they are not led by the same Holy Ghost as those were that gave forth the scriptures; which Holy Ghost they must come to in themselves, and be led by, if they come into all the truth of them, and to have the comfort of God, Christ, and them. For none can call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost; and all that call Christ Lord without the Holy Ghost, take his name in vain. Like∣wise all that name his name are to depart from iniquity; then they name his name with reverence, in truth and righteousness. O therefore feel the grace and truth in thy heart, that is come by Jesus Christ, that will teach thee how to live, and what to deny. It will establish thy heart, season thy words, and bring thy salvation, and will be a
<PB N="231" REF="037441_0747_100D9331F8B6EBC0"/>teacher unto thee at all times. By it thou mayest receive Christ, from whence it comes; and as many as receive him, to them he gives power not only to stand against sin and evil, but to become the sons of God: if sons, then heirs of a life, and a world and kingdom without end, and of the eternal riches and treasures thereof. So in haste, with my love in the Lord Jesus Christ, who tasted death for every man, and bruises the serpent's head, that has been betwixt God and man, that through Christ man may come to God again, and praise him through Jesus Christ the Amen, the spiritual, heavenly rock and foundation for all God's people to build upon, to the praise and glory of God, who is over all, blessed for evermore!</P>

<P>Next day John Claus and I passed to Buyckslote, Pur∣merent, and Alkmaer, about thirty miles from Amsterdam. We went to a friend's whose name was Willem Willems, where I had a meeting that night. I had another next day, which was larger: several professors came, and all was quiet and well. After the meeting I visited some friends; then, taking boat, passed to Hoorn, counted the chief city in North Holland. We lodged at an inn; and, taking wag∣gon
<PB N="232" REF="037441_0748_100D933412CB0130"/>early next morning, we passed to Enckhuysen, where we took ship for Friesland; and, landing in the afternoon at Workum, took water, and rode upon the high bank of the Friezen seas, till we met two friends coming with a wag∣gon to meet us, with whom we went to Harlingen, the chief sea-port town in Friesland. We went to Hessel Jacobs's, whither several friends came to visit us that night. Next day we visited the friends of the place; and I wrote a paper, directed. <Q>To all them that persecute friends for not ob∣serving their fast-day.</Q></P>
<P>The day following being first-day, friends had a meeting there, to which we went, and many professors came to it. I declared the everlasting gospel amongst them, John Claus interpreting. They were all very civil, and heard attentive∣ly; and when the meeting was done, departed peaceably, without making any opposition. After meeting I went to Hessel Jacobs's again, whither after awhile came a Calvin∣ist, to ask me some questions, which I answered to his satis∣faction; and he departed friendly. Soon after he was gone, a preacher of the Collegians came to discourse with me, who seemed well satisfied also, and we parted lovingly. That evening I had another meeting with the friends there, and next morning we passed to Leuwarden, the chief city in Friesland, and lodged that night at a friend's house whose name was Sybrand Dowes.</P>
<P>Next morning early we passed to Dockum, and, walking through the city, took boat again to Strobus, which is the utmost part of Friesland. There we baited at a commissa∣ry's. Then taking boat, we passed to Groningen, the chief city of the province of Groningland. One of the magis∣trates of that city came with us from Leuwarden, with whom I had some discourse on the way; and he was very loving. We walked near three miles through the city; then took boat for Delfziel; and passing, in the evening, through Ap∣pingdalem, where had been a great horse-fair that day, there came many officers rushing into the boat, who, being in drink, were very rude. I exhorted them to <Q>fear the Lord, and beware of Solomon's vanities.</Q> They were a sort of boisterous fellows; yet somewhat more civil afterwards. We landed at Delfziel about the tenth hour at night, having travelled much about fifty English miles that day. We went to an inn to lodge; and as we passed through the guards, they examined John Claus, whether I was not a
<PB N="233" REF="037441_0749_100D9335D0FC7708"/>militia soldier? He told them I was not, and they let us pass peaceably.</P>
<P>Delfziel stands on the river Eems, over which we passed next day to Embden, where friends had been cruelly per∣fecuted, and from which they had been often banished. I went to an inn, where I dined with some men that under∣stood English, with whom I had a fine time, and they were loving. Meanwhile John Claus went with his wife to her father's, in Embden; whither, after I had dined, I went also, understanding the old man was desirous to see me. In the afternoon John Claus and I walked through the city, to the place where the waggon was to meet us: and while we tarried for it, the friends that were in the city came to the house where we were, and we had a little meeting. When the meeting was over, and the waggon came not, we sent to know the reason. The master of the waggon sent us word, he durst not let his waggon go; for the bishop of Munster's soldiers were up in the country, and he was afraid they would take away his horses. Being disappointed of our passage, we returned to John Claus's father-in-law's house, where I left him, and went to my inn at night.</P>
<P>We took shipping next day, and passed about fifteen miles upon the river Eems, to a market-town in East Fries∣land, called Leer, where lived a friend that had been banish∣ed from Embden. When we had visited him, we hired a waggon, and passed to a garrison-town called Strikehuysen, where the guards examined us; and then we went to Deter∣en, where hiring another waggon, we passed to another gar∣rison town, where we were very strictly examined. From thence we passed to Apre, in the king of Denmark's coun∣try, where we lodged that night. In our travelling this day, we met the earl of Oldenburgh, going to the treaty of peace at Lembachie.</P>
<P>Next day we passed to Oldenburgh, lately a great and fa∣mous place, but then burnt down, and but few houses left standing in it. At this place we hired another waggon, and went to Delmenhurst, where, after we had been examined by the guards, we went to a burgomaster's to lodge, whose house was at an inn. There being many people, I decla∣red the way of truth to him and them, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all evil-doers.</P>
<P>We passed next day to Bremen, a stately city in Germa∣ny; and from thence, after a double examination, we went to a water called Overdeland, and there took boat to Fisher∣holder;
<PB N="234" REF="037441_0750_100D933880E80E40"/>where finding pretty many people together, I de∣clared the way of God to them, and exhorted them <Q>to fear the Lord.</Q> There we took waggon again, and travelled in the bishop of Munster's country, to Closter-Seven. Hav∣ing no inclination to stay there, we got fresh horses, intend∣ing to travel all night. Accordingly we went a little way; but it quickly grew so dark, and rained so hard, that we thought best to turn back again; for our waggon being open, we had no defence against the rain, and our cloaths were already wet with the rain that had fallen for several days before. So we went to an inn, and got a little fresh straw; upon which we lay till about break of day, then set out and travelled to the city of Buxtehude.</P>
<P>The people in the bishop of Munster's country were very dark. As we passed amongst them, I preached truth to them, warning them of the great and notable day of the Lord, exhorting them to soberness, and to mind the good Spirit of God in themselves.</P>
<P>It was on a first-day that we went through Buxtehude; and without the walls was a great fair of sheep and geese that day. We staid a little to refresh ourselves, and went on as fast as we could to Hamburgh, partly by waggon, and partly by water.</P>
<P>We got to Hamburgh time enough to have a meeting there that evening. A good and glorious meeting it was. There were, amongst others, a baptist teacher and his wife, and a great man of Sweden with his wife; and all was quiet, blessed be the Lord, whose power was exalted over all! Yet a hard, dark place this is, and the people are much shut up from truth.</P>
<P>At Hamburgh was a woman that had spoken against me in John Perrot's time, though she had never seen me till now. She had been troubled for it ever since, and now was glad of an opportunity to acknowledge her sault; which she very readily did, and I as readily and freely for∣gave her.</P>
<P>We staid that night at Hamburgh, encouraging and strengthening the friends there in their testimony to the truth; and betimes next morning we set forwards towards Frederickstadt, which is two long days journey from Ham∣burgh. We went the first-day to Elmshoorn, where we baited, and then rode through a garrison-town of the king of Denmark's; and, passing by the monument of the earl of Rantzow, came to the city of Itzeho, where we lodged that
<PB N="235" REF="037441_0751_100D933B55C49DD8"/>night. I had some service in the evening, among the people in the inn, whom I exhorted to soberness, and to live in the fear of the Lord. Next morning we travelled to Hoghenhorn, where we dined at an inn with one of the coun∣cil of Frederickstadt; to whom, and to the rest of the peo∣ple present, I declared the truth, with which they seemed to be affected. Then travelling on, we came to a river cal∣led Eyder, where we took boat and went to Frederickstadt. We went to William Paul's, where several friends came to us, for there is a pretty company of friends in that city. We had a fine refreshing meeting together that evening, which made us forget our weariness; for we were indeed very weary, having travelled hard those two days, and were wet through our cloaths, having had much rain in our open waggons. But the Lord made all easy and good to us; and we were well and glad to see friends; blessed be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>This city is in the duke of Holstein's country, who would have banished friends out of the city and country, and sent to the magistrates of the city to do it; but they said, they would lay down their offices rather than do it; inasmuch as themselves came to that city to enjoy the liberty of their consciences. Friends still enjoy their liberty there, and truth and they are of good report amongst the people, both in city and country.</P>
<P>On first-day I had a meeting here, to which many people came, and some rough spirits; but the power of the Lord bound them down, and the Seed of life was set over all. While I was here, I had a discourse with a Levite concern∣ing the coming of the Messiah; and he was much confound∣ed in what he said; yet he carried himself lovingly, and in∣vited me to his house. I went, and there discoursed with a Jew, who shewed me their Talmud, and many other Jew∣ish books: but they are very dark, and do not understand their own prophets.</P>
<P>There was at this city a Baptist teacher, who had reproach∣ed and belied friends; wherefore John Claus went, with two friends of the town, to the house where he lodged, cleared truth and friends from his reproaches, and laid his lies and slanders upon his own head, to his shame.</P>
<P>Before we left this place, I had another meeting with friends only, wherein I laid before them the usefulness of a monthly meeting, for looking after the poor, and taking care that marriages, and all other things relating to the
<PB N="236" REF="037441_0752_100D933CE650BF10"/>church, were performed in an orderly manner. The thing answered the witness of God in their consciences, so they readily agreed to have monthly meetings thenceforward amongst themselves, that both men and women might take care of the outward concerns of the church.</P>
<P>Feeling my spirit clear of that place, we took leave of friends, whom we left in good order, and turned back for Hamburgh. When we had travelled one day's journey, and came to an inn at night to lodge, I enquired whether there were any tender people in the town that feared God, or that had a mind to discourse of the things of God? The inn-keeper told me, there were few such in that town. Next night we got to Hamburgh, and having passed the guards, went to a friend's house, being very weary; for we had been up those two mornings before the third hour, and had travelled each day hard and late. Here we met with John Hill, an English friend, who had been travelling in Germany; and being in a ship bound for Amsterdam that waited for a wind, he had lain sick on board about two weeks; and now hearing that I was in the country got off from the ship, and came hither to meet me, and go along with me.</P>
<P>We had a very good meeting here, and very peaceable. After which I had discourse with a Swede, an eminent man in his own country; who having been banished from thence upon the account of his religion, was come to Hamburgh, and was at the meeting I had there before. When I had done with him, I had another discourse with a Baptist con∣cerning the sacraments, so called: in both which I had good service, having opportunity thereby to open truth un∣to them.</P>
<P>Being clear of Hamburgh, we took leave of friends there, whom we left well; and taking John Hill with us, passed by boat to a city in the duke of Lunenburgh's country; where, after we were examined by the guards, we were had to the main guard, and there examined more strictly; but after they found we were not soldiers, they were civil to us, and let us pass. In the afternoon we travelled by waggon, and the waters being much out, by reason of the great rains that had fallen, when it drew towards night we hired a boy to guide us through a great water. When we came to it the water was so deep, before we could come at the bridge, that the waggoner was sain to wade, and I drove the wag∣gon. When we were come upon the bridge, the horses broke part of it down, and one of them fell into the water,
<PB N="237" REF="037441_0753_100D933F18C602B0"/>the waggon standing upon that part of the bridge which remained unbroken. It was the Lord's mercy to us, that the waggon did not run into the brook. When they had got the horse out, he lay awhile as if he had been dead; but at length they got him up, put him to the waggon again, laid the planks right, and then, through the goodness of the Lord to us, we got safe over.</P>
<P>After this we came to another water, which finding to be very deep, and it being in the night, we hired two men to help us through. These men put cords to the waggon to hold it by, that the force of the water might not drive it beside the way. But when we came into it, the stream was so strong it took one of the horses off his legs, and was car∣rying him down the stream; which I seeing, called to the waggoner to pluck him to him by his reins, which he did, and the horse recovered his legs, and with much difficulty we got over the bridge, and went to Bormer-haven, the town where the waggoner lived. It was the last day of the sixth month that we escaped these dangers, and being about the eleventh hour in the night when we came in here, we got some fresh straw, and lay upon it till about four in the morning. Then getting up, we set forward again towards Bremen, going part of the way by waggon, and part by boat. In the way I had good opportunities to publish truth, especially at a market-town where we staid to change our passage; where I declared the truth to the people, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all flesh; and exhorting them to righteousness, telling them, 'that God was come to teach his people himself,' and that they should turn to the Lord, and hearken to the teachings of his Spirit in their own hearts.</P>
<P>At Bremen we were examined, and after went to an inn, and staid till another waggon was provided to carry us fur∣ther. Though I felt the Lord's power was over the city, and kept the wicked and unruly spirits down, yet my spirit suffered much in this place for the people's sake. When our waggon was ready we left Bremen, and travelled to Ke∣by, where we lodged at an inn, and early next morning set out for Oldenburgh. It was a lamentable sight to see so great and brave a city burnt down. We went to an inn, and though it was first-day the soldiers were drinking, and playing at shovel-board, and at those few houses that were left, the shops were open, and the people trading one with another. I was moved to declare the truth among them,
<PB N="238" REF="037441_0754_100D9340AF2EC028"/>and warn them of the judgments of God; and though they heard me quietly, and were civil towards me, yet I was bur∣thened with their wickedness. Many times in mornings, and at noons and nights, at the inns, and on the ways, as I travelled, I spoke to the people, preaching the truth to them, warning them of the day of the Lord, and exhorting them to turn to the light and Spirit of God in themselves, that thereby they might be led out of evil.</P>
<P>Next day, passing through many great waters, we came to Leer, and the day following to Embden, where John Claus's wife's father lived; at whose house, when we went into Germany, we left a young man sick, who travel∣led with me, and used to write for me; whom now we found pretty well recovered. John Claus went to his father-in∣law's, John Hill and I to an inn, where we dined. After dinner we went also to John Claus's father's, and had a good meeting there in the evening.</P>
<P>The day following we took shipping at Embden, and passed to Delfziel, and went to an inn, where a friend came to us that then lived in Delfziel, having been often banished from Embden: he was a goldsmith by trade, and had a house and shop in Embden, and still as they banished him he went again. Then they imprisoned him, fed him with bread and water, and at length took his goods from him, and banished him, his wife and children, leaving them nei∣ther place to come to, nor any thing to subsist on. We comforted and encouraged him in the Lord, exhorting him to be faithful, and stand steadfast in the testimony committed to him. When we had taken leave of him, we passed the same day to Groningen, where we met with Cornelius An∣dries, a friend, that had also suffered much by imprison∣ment and banishment at Embden. We went with him to his house, and the next day we had a good meeting in that city, to which several professors came, who were very peace∣able and attentive. After meeting we passed by boat to Stro∣bus, and Dockum, where we lodged that night at an inn. Taking boat again next morning, we passed to Leuwarden, the chief city of Frienstand, where I found my daughter Yeomans, who was come from Amsterdam thither to meet me. That day we had a precious meeting at Sybrand Dowes's house. After the meeting I had discourse with some that were at the meeting, who had been formerly con∣vinced of truth; but were not come into obedience to it.
<PB N="239" REF="037441_0755_100D9343D3365D90"/>We staid there that night; but John Hill left us, and went that day to Harlingen, and so to Amsterdam.</P>
<P>Next day we passed down the river to the lake of Hem∣pen-Sarmer, and thence by the lake Lugmer, and so to a town called Anderigo; from whence sailing through the lake Whispool, we came to Gardick within night. We lodged at an inn; and the next day, being first-day, we were at friends meeting there, which was very large, many of the town's-people coming in. I declared the truth in the power of the Lord, that was upon me; which tendered the people, and they were very sober. After the meeting we staid to refresh ourselves, and went to take boat again; but the people observing us, gathered together at a bridge we were to pass, and there I declared the way of life and salva∣tion unto them, and they were very attentive and civil.</P>
<P>We went back that evening to Leuwarden, being twenty∣seven miles; but before we could reach it, the gates were shut and the bridges drawn up, so that we could not get into the city, but were fain to lie in the boat all night; and a man being killed in the city that night, it was late before the gates were opened. When we could get in, we went to a friend's house, where we staid awhile; then taking boat, we passed through Franeker to Harlingen, to Hassel Jacobs's, where we found several Dutch friends come to be at the meeting there next day. William Penn, returning two or three days before out of Germany, had been at a large meeting at Amsterdam on first-day; and after meet∣ing, understanding I was at Harlingen, came thither to me.</P>
<P>Next day was the monthly meeting for men and women, to which we went. It was large and good. And there it was agreed, <Q>a meeting should be held there once a month, both for the men and for the women, to take care of the outward concerns of the church.</Q></P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a publick meeting, to which came people of several sorts. Socinians, Baptists, Luther∣ans, &amp;c. amongst whom was a doctor of physich and a priest. After I had declared the truth pretty largely open∣ing the happy state that man and woman were in whilst they kept under God's teaching, and abode in paradise; and the wo and misery that came upon them when they went from God's teaching, hearkened to the serpent's, trans∣gressed God's command, and were driven out of the para∣dise of God; and set forth the way whereby man and wo∣man might come into that happy state again: the priest, an
<PB N="240" REF="037441_0756_100D93456289DF88"/>ancient grave man, stood up just as I had done speaking, and, putting off his hat, said, <Q>I pray God to prosper and consirm that doctrine, for it is truth, and I have nothing 'against it.</Q> He would willingly have staid till the meeting had been ended, but being to preach that evening, he could not stay longer, the time for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own worship being come. Wherefore, when he had made confession of the truth, he hastened away, that he might come again; and did come, it seems, to the meeting-place, but the meeting was ended first. After which we went to Hassel Jacobs's, where I had a meeting with friends, and the doctor of phy∣sick came thither to discourse with William Penn, who had a good opportunity to open truth to him. By this doctor the priest sent his love to me, wishing him to tell me, that he had left preaching that evening half an hour sooner than he used to do, that he might come to our meeting again to hear more of that good doctrine. I heard afterwards, that his hearers questioned him for what he had said in our meet∣ing; and that, he standing by his words, they had com∣plained of him for it to the other priests of the city, who called him to account about it; but the result I could not learn.</P>
<P>Early next morning William Penn, taking John Claus with him, passed from Harlingen for Leuwarden, where he had appointed a meeting, intending to travel into some other parts of Germany to visit a tender people there. I, with those friends that were with me, took ship the same day for Amsterdam, where we arrived a little after mid∣night; but the gates being shut, we lay on board till morn∣ing: then went to Gertrude Dirick Nieson's, where many friends came to see us, being glad of our safe return. Next day, seeling a concern upon my mind, with relation to those seducing spirits that made division among friends, and being sensible that they endeavoured to insinuate themselves into the affectionate part, I was moved to write a few lines to friends concerning them, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL these that set themselves up in the affections of the people, set themselves up, and the affections of the people, and not Christ. But friends, your peace∣able habitation in the truth, which is everlasting, and changes not, will outlast all the habitations of those that are out of the truth, although they be never so full of words. So those that are so keen for J. S. and J. W. let
<PB N="241" REF="037441_0757_100D934742380228"/>them take them, and the separation; and you that have given your testimony against that spirit, stand in your testimony, till they answer by condemnation. Do not strive, nor make bargains with that which is out of the truth; nor save that alive to be a sacrifice for God, which should be slain, lest you lose your kingdom.</P>

<P>The first-day following, I was at friends meeting at Am∣sterdam, to which many people came, and were very civil and attentive, hearing truth declared several hours. John Roeloffs interpreted for me.</P>
<P>Before this several of the friends that came over with me were returned to England again, as Robert Barclay, George Keith's wife, and others; and now my daughter Yeomans went back also: so that I was left alone at Amsterdam. While I was there, it came upon me to visit my suffering friends at Dantzick with a few lines, to encourage and strengthen them in their sufferings, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom is my love in the Lord's truth, that is over all, and by which all God's people are made free men and women, being thereby set free from him who is out of the truth; that walking in the truth, they may answer the witness of God in all people: which truth all must come to, if they be made free. Therefore be saithful unto what the Lord manifests unto you. I am glad the Lord hath witnesses in that city, to stand for his glory and name, and for Christ Jesus, the great prophet, whom God hath raised up, who is to be heard in all things; so that ye need none of the prophets which men have raised up. Therefore stand faithful to Christ Jesus, your Shepherd, that he may seed you; hear his voice, and follow him, who has laid down his life for you; but follow none of the shepherds and hirelings that are made by men, though they may be angry because ye will not follow them to their dry and bar∣ren mountains, who have been and are the thieves, perse∣cutors, and robbers, that climb up another way than by Christ. Set up Christ to be your counsellor and leader, and then ye will have no need of any of the counsellors and leaders of the world; for Christ is sufficient, whom
<PB N="242" REF="037441_0758_100D934AABF069C0"/>God has given you. Set up Christ Jesus to be your bishop and overseer, who is sufficient to oversee you, that you go not astray from God; by which ye may see over all the hireling-overseers made by men, which keep the people, that they do not go from the rudiments, forma∣lities, fashions, and customs of the world, which hath been and is their work. I am glad that ye are come to own Christ Jesus, your high priest, who is holy, harmless, sepa∣rate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens, as the church and the apostle did own him in their days, Heb. vii. who is the high priest over the household of faith; which faith Christ Jesus is the author and sinisher of: and this do all the children of the new covenant witness, who walk in the new and living way. Therefore my disire is, that ye all may be steadfast, whether in bonds or out, in the faith of Christ Jesus, which is the gift of God; by which faith the valiants overcame the devil and all their enemies; in which faith they had victory and access to God, and in that was their unity; which mystery of faith is held in a pure conscience, hidden from the world. I do believe, that your imprisonments and sufferings in that place will be for good in the end (as it hath been in other places) ye standing faithful to the Lord, who is all-suffici∣ent. For your sufferings and trials will try their teachers and religions, churches and worships, and make manifest what birth they are of; even that which persecutes him that is born of the Spirit: for ye know that there is no sal∣vation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Jesus; therefore it is time to leave them, when there is no salvation by or in any of them. Now, friends, I desire that you would take a list of the names of all those that belong to the king of Poland, where they live, and how ye may send books and epistles to them, and keep a correspondence with them; also the name of the bishop or cardinal that I heard was with you; and if ye can get any that belong to the king to come to visit the prisoners, that they may inform the king of their cruel sufferings. Also I desire you to get as many books of mine as you can dis∣pose of, that set forth your sufferings, and the cruelty of the magistrates of Dantzick; and give them to the king, his council, attendants, and bishops. And some of the women may speak to the queen, if they can, that she may signify to the king their cruel sufferings; and especially some of the sufferers wives, if there be any of capacity to
<PB N="243" REF="037441_0759_100D934CB4726FF8"/>do it. You may likewise give his attendants any other friends books; what books ye lack, send for to Amsterdam, where ye may be furnished with them, to answer every ten∣der desirer, and inquiring mind after the Lord. So let all your minds be bended with the Lord's power, to spread his truth abroad; and where ye hear of any, or have any correspondence in trading with any sober people, far or near, send them books, that their understandings may be opened after the Lord. The Lord God Almighty pre∣serve you! To his protection, in his eternal power, do I commend you all, in bonds or at liberty, with my love to you in the everlasting seed of God Christ Jesus, who bruises the head of the serpent, that makes you to suffer. Christ is over him, and will be when he is gone, who is First and Last, over all, from everlasting to ever∣lasting, in whom ye have life, knowledge, wisdom, and salvation, and through him live to the praise and glory of God, who is blessed for evermore, Amen.</P>

<P>The next day, the fourth of the week and the nineteenth of the month, I had a large meeting at Amsterdam, many professors being at it, and truth was largely opened to them, in the demonstration of the heavenly power. The day following I went by boat, many friends going with me, to Landsmeer in Waterland (a town in which, they say, there are above an hundred bridges) where I had a very good meeting, to which several professors came. After the meet∣ing I returned with friends to Amsterdam again, where I staid till the first-day following, and went to their meeting which was large. Many professors of several sorts were at it, and heard the truth declared with great attention.</P>
<P>I tarried next day, and the night following had a great exercise upon my spirit concerning that loose spirit that was run into strife and contention among friends, and had drawn some after it into division and separation; the way, work, and end whereof the Lord opened to me; wherefore, feeling the motion of life upon me, I got up in the morning and wrote the following epistle to friends.</P>

<P>KEEP your first love in the truth, power, and seed of life in Christ Jesus; for this last night, as I was ly∣ing in my bed at Amsterdam, I had a great travail in the holy seed of life and peace, and my spirit was troubled with that spirit of strife and separation. I saw it was a destroy∣ing spirit, and did seek not only to get over the seed, but to destroy it, and to eat out the minds of the people from it by strife and contention; and under pretence of stand∣ing for the ancient truth, its work is to root it out and des∣troy the appearance of it, to set up itself. It is a creeping spirit, seeking whom it can get into; and what it cannot do itself it stirreth up others to do, and setteth their spirits on float, with the dark wisdom to destroy the simple. This spirit is managed by the prince of the air, and lead∣eth some to do things they would have been ashamed to have done, as men, which doth unman them; and they would not have suffered them, if they had kept to the tender principle of God, which leadeth to peace. It is a despising, backbiting, secret-whispering spirit, a sower of dissension, and a taker of advantage of all prejudiced spi∣rits that are disobedient to their first principle and love and truth, and begetteth into hatred; so it begetteth all into that spirit, whose work is to destroy both the good within and the good order without. Nay, it would, if it could, destroy the government of Christ and the order of the gos∣pel, to set up its own will and spirit, which is not of God, and, under pretence of crying down man, is setting up man, and gathering into a separation of disobedient men, who float above their conditions. This spirit, which nei∣ther liveth in the truth nor its order, but opposeth them that do. I cannot express it as I sec it and its work, whose end will be accordingly. Therefore, friends, I am to warn you all that have not lost your simplicity, not to touch it, nor to have any unity with it, lest you be defil∣ed, lose your conditions of your eternal estate, and your everlasting portion; and that your inward man, which is after God, may be preserved, and Christ may reign in all your hearts. And they that are joined with them, it will be very hard for them ever to come down to truth in them∣selves, and to see their own conditions, and to have that spirit of strife and contention (which eateth as a canker) brought down in them: which is carnal, and slayeth the tender babe, which was once begotten in themselves. The
<PB N="245" REF="037441_0761_100D934FE46640A8"/>Philistine is got up in them, that stoppeth the wells and springs, maketh a great bustle, and is crying up men, and pleading for them instead of Christ. So, friends, strive not with them, but let those take them that cry them up. Keep you to the Lord Jesus Christ with his light, that cometh from him, that he may be your Lord, and ye in him may be all in unity, in one light, life, power, and dominion in Christ, your head. The God of Peace and Power preserve you all in Christ Jesus your Saviour, and out of and from that mischievous spirit which is idle and slothful, as to the work of the Power, Spirit, and Light of God and Christ. Its very act worketh strife and dis∣turbance against the peace of the church of Christ. It thinks in its wilfulness, stubbornness, and unruliness to set up itself, and in that to have peace; but destruction will be the end of it: and it is sealed for the fire and eternal judgment. Therefore let Christ the Seed be the head and crown of every one of you, that nothing may be be∣tween you and the Lord God. Be not deceived with vain, feigned, or rough words: for Satan is transforming him∣self as an Angel of Light to deceive, but God's founda∣tion standeth sure, and God knoweth who are his, and will preserve his upon the rock and foundation of life, in his peaceable truth and habitation, that in the same they may grow. Keep out of strife and contention with it, after ye have borne your testimony in the Lord's power and truth against it, then keep in the truth; for it hath a life in scribbling, strife, and jangling, because it would en∣large its hell, and bring others into its misery with the airy power, and would get power over the good, and dis∣join people from it, and so commit rapes upon the simpli∣city by its subtilty. But I do believe the Lord will de∣fend his people, though he may try them and exercise them with this spirit for a time, as he hath done it days past, in other vessels it hath made use of as it doth of these now, who have a more seeming fair outside, but foul, rough, and rugged enough within, against the Seed Christ, as ever were the Pharisees to destroy it. They, under a pretence of preaching Christ, are destroyers and crucifiers of him, and killers of the just, not only in themselves, but are endeavouring with all their might to destroy it in others where it is born. Pharaoh and Herod slay the young Jews in the spirit as the old did: I seel it worrying of them. That is got up to be king, which knew not suf∣fering
<PB N="246" REF="037441_0762_100D9352A432B558"/>Joseph. But God will plague him, and the Seed will have more rest, and be better entertained in Egypt than under Herod, into whom old Pharaoh's spirit is en∣tered. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear, and an eye to see, let him see how this spirit hath transformed in all ages against the just and righteous; but mark what hath been its end. The Seed reigneth; glory to the Lord God over all for ever! His truth spreadeth, and friends here are in unity and peace, and of good report, answering the good or that of God in people. My desires are, that all God's people may do the same in all places, that the Lord may be glorified in their bringing forth much fruit that is heavenly and spiritual. Amen.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After I had given forth the foregoing epistle, whereby my spirit was in some measure eased of the weight that lay upon it, I went in the afternoon to the monthly meeting of friends at Amsterdam; where the Lord was present with us, and re∣freshed our spirits together in himself.</P>
<P>I thought to have gone next day to Harlem: but there being a fast appointed to be kept that day, I was stopped in my spirit, and moved to stay at friends meeting at Amster∣dam. We had a very large meeting, a great concourse of people coming to it, and amongst them many great persons. The Lord's power was over the meeting, in the openings whereof I was moved to declare to the people, <Q>That no man by all his wit and study, nor by reading history in his own will, could declare or know the generation of Christ, who was not begotten by the will of man, but by the will of God. After I had largely opened this, I shewed them the difference between the true fast and the false, ma∣nifesting that the professed Christians, Jews, and Turks, were out of the true fast, and fasted for strife and debate, being under the band and fists of iniquity and oppression, wherewith they were smiting one another; but the pure hands were not lifted up to God. And though they did all appear to men to fast, and did hang down their heads for a day like a bulrush, yet that was not the fast which God did accept; but in that state all their bones were dry, and when they called upon the Lord he did not answer them, neither did their health grow; for they kept their
<PB N="247" REF="037441_0763_100D9354DC3B3FC8"/>own fast, and not the Lord's. I exhorted them to keep the Lord's fast, which was to fast from sin and iniquity, strife and debate, violence and oppression, and to abstain from every appearance of evil.</Q> These things were open∣ed to the astonishment of the fasters, and the meeting ended peaceably and well.</P>
<P>I went to Harlem the day following, having before ap∣pointed a meeting. Peter Hendricks and Gertrude Dirick Nieson went with me, and a blessed meeting we had. There were professors of several sorts, and a priest of the Lutherans, who sat very attentive for several hours while I declared the truth. Gertrude interpreting. When the meeting was done, the priest said, <Q>He had heard nothing but what was ac∣cording to the word of God, and desired the blessing of the Lord might rest upon us and our assemblies.</Q> Others also confessed to the truth, saying, <Q>They had never heard things so plainly opened to their understandings before.</Q></P>
<P>We staid that night at Harlem at a friend's house, whose name was Dirick Klassen; and returning next day to Amster∣dam, went to Gertrude's house; where we had not been long before a priest of great note, who had formerly belonged to the emperor of Germany, and another German priest, came, desiring to have some conference with me. I took the op∣portunity to declare the way of truth, opening unto them how they might come to know God and Christ, and his law and gospel; and shewing them, that they could never know it by study, nor philosophy, but by divine revelation through the Spirit of God, opening to them in the stillness of their minds. The men were tender, and went away well satisfied.</P>
<P>The first-day following I was at friends meeting at Am∣sterdam, where, amongst several sorts of professors, was a doctor of Poland, who for his religion was banished from the place he lived in, and being affected with the testimony of truth in the meeting, he came afterwards to have some discourse with me: and after we had been some time to∣gether, and I had opened things further to him, he went away very tender and loving.</P>
<P>While I was at Amsterdam, I spent much of my time in writing books, papers, or epistles on truth's behalf. I wrote several epistles from Amsterdam to friends in England and elsewhere, on several occasions, as the Lord moved me by his Spirit thereunto. I wrote also from thence, <Q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Oldenburgh, which was
<PB N="248" REF="037441_0764_100D9356F784EBD0"/>lately burned down;</Q> also, <Q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Hamburgh.</Q> I wrote also an epistle to the ambassadors that were treating about a peace at Nimeguen. To the magistrates and priests of Embden I wrote, shewing them their unchristian practices in persecuting friends. I wrote several other books there, in answer to priests and others, of Hamburgh, Dantzick, and other places, to clear the truth and friends from their false charges and slanders.</P>
<P>After some time George Keith and William Penn came back from Germany to Amsterdam, and had a dispute with one Galenus Abrahams (one of the most noted Baptists in Holland) at which many professors were present; but not having time to finish the dispute then, they met again two days after, and the Baptist was much confounded, and truth gained ground. Between these two disputes we had a very great meeting at friends meeting-place, at which many hun∣dreds of people were; some of high rank in the world's ac∣count. An earl, a lord, and divers other eminent persons were present, who all behaved themselves very civilly. But, when the meeting was ended, some priests began to make opposition; which when William Penn understood, he stood up again, and answered them to the great satisfac∣tion of the people, who were much affected with the several testimonies they had heard. After the meeting several of them came to Gertrude's, where we were, with whom George Keith had much discourse in Latin.</P>
<P>Having now finished our service at Amsterdam, we took leave of friends there, and passed by waggon to Leyden, about twenty-five miles; where we staid a day or two, seek∣ing out and visiting some tender people that we heard of there. We met with a German, who was partly convinced. He informed us of an eminent man that was inquiring after truth. Some sought him out and visited him, and found him a serious man. I also spoke to him, and he owned the truth. William Penn and Benjamin Furly went to visit another great man, that lived a little out of Leyden, who, they said, had been general to the king of Denmark's forces. He and his wife were very loving to them, and heard the truth with joy.</P>
<P>From Leyden we went to the Hague, where the prince of Orange kept his court; and visited one of the judges of Holland, with whom we had much discourse. He was a wise tender man, and put many objections and queries to us, which when we had answered, he was satisfied, and part∣ed
<PB N="249" REF="037441_0765_100D93590376DB28"/>with us in much love. Leaving the Hague, we went to Delft, and from thence that night to Rotterdam, where we staid several days, and had several meetings. While I was here, I gave forth a book for the Jews, with whom, when I was at Amsterdam, I had a desire to have had some discourse; but they would not. Here also I reviewed seve∣ral other books and papers, which I had given forth before, and were now transcribed.</P>
<P>Finding our spirits clear of the service which the Lord had given us to do in Holland, we took leave of friends of Rotterdam, and passed by boat to the Briel, in order to take passage that day in the packet-boat for England, several friends of Rotterdam accompanying us, and some of Am∣sterdam, who were come to see us again before we left Hol∣land. But the packet-boat not coming in till night, we were fain to lodge at the Briel; and next day, the one-and-twentieth of the eighth month, and the first-day of the week, we went on board, and set sail about the tenth hour, viz. William Penn, George Keith and I, and Gertrude Dirick Nieson, with her children.</P>
<P>We were in all about sixty passengers, and had a long and hazardous passage: for the winds were contrary, and the weather stormy; the boat also very leaky, insomuch that we were fain to have two pumps continually going day and night, so that it was thought there was twice as much water pumped out as the vessel would have held. But the Lord, who is able to make the stormy winds to cease and the raging waves of the sea to be calm, yea, to raise them and stop them at his pleasure, he alone did preserve us; praised be his name for ever! Though our passage was hard, yet we had a fine time, and good service for truth on board among the passengers, some of whom were great folk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and were very kind and loving. We arrived at Harwich the 23d of the eighth month at night, having been two nights and almost three days at sea. Next morning William Penn and George Keith took horse for Colchester; but I staid, and had a meeting at Harwich; and there being no Col∣chester coach there, and the post-master's wife being unrea∣sonable in her demands for a coach, and deceiving us of it also after we had hired it, we went to a friend's house about a mile and an half in the country, and hired his waggon, which we bedded well with straw, and rode in it to Col∣chester.</P>
<P>I staid in Colchester till first-day, having a desire to be at
<PB N="250" REF="037441_0766_100D935B97FAB7B8"/>friends' meeting there that day; and a very large and weighty meeting it was: for friends hearing of my return from Hol∣land, flocked from several parts of the country; and many of the town's people coming also, it was thought there were about a thousand people at the meeting, and all was peace∣able. Having staid a day or two longer at Colchester, I travelled through Essex, visiting friends at Halsted. Brain∣tree, Felsted, and Saling, and having meetings with them. At Chelmsford I had a meeting in the evening. There being many friends prisoners, they got liberty, and came to the meeting, and we were well refreshed together in the Lord. Next day, the 9th of the ninth month, I got to London, where friends received me with great joy; and the first-day following went to Gracechurch-street meeting, where the Lord visited us with his refreshing presence, and the glory of the Lord surrounded the meeting; praised be the Lord!</P>
<P>After I had been a little while in London, I wrote the following letter to my wife:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear heart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom is my love, and to the children, and to all the rest of friends in the Lord's truth, power, and Seed, that is over all; glory to the Lord, and blessed be his name for ever beyond all words! who hath carried me through and over many trials and dangers in his eternal power! I have been twice at Gracechurch-street meet∣ing; and though opposite spirits were there, yet all was quiet; the dew of heaven fell upon the people, and the glory of the Lord shined over all. Every day I am fain to be at meetings about business, and sufferings, which are great abroad; and now many friends are concerned with many persons about them: so in haste, with my love to you all—</P>

</LETTER>
<P>About this time I received letters from New-England, which gave account of the magistrates and rulers cruel and unchristian proceedings against friends there, whipping and abusing them very shamefully; for they whipped many wo∣men friends. One woman they tied to a cart, and dragged her along the street, she being stripped above the waist.
<PB N="251" REF="037441_0767_100D935D29B23990"/>Yea, they whipped some masters of ships, that were not friends, only for bringing friends thither. At that very time, while they were persecuting friends in this barbarous man∣ner, the Indians slew threescore of their men, took one of their captains, and flayed the skin off his head while he was alive, and carried it away in triumph: so that the sober people said, <Q>The judgments of God came upon them for persecuting the Quakers:</Q> but the blind, dark priests said, "It was because they did not persecute them enough." Great exercise I had in seeking relief here for poor suffer∣ing friends there, that they might not lie under the rod of the wicked.</P>
<P>Upon this and other services for truth I staid in London a month or five weeks, visiting meetings, and helping and encouraging friends to labour for the deliverance of their suffering brethren in other parts. Afterwards I went to Kingston, and visited friends there and thereaway. Having stard a little among friends there, overlooking a book which I had then ready to go to the press, I went into Bucking∣hamshire, visiting friends, and had several meetings amongst them at Amersham, Hungerhill, Jordans, Hedgerly, Wick∣ham, and Turvil-heath. Im some of which, those that were gone out from the unity of friends in truth, into strife, op∣position, and division, were very unruly and troublesome; particularly at the men's meeting at Thomas Ellwood's at Hungerhill, where the chief of them came from Wickham, endeavouring to make disturbance, and to hinder friends from proceeding in the business of the meeting. When I saw their design, I admonished them to be sober and quiet, and not trouble the meeting, by interrupting the service thereof; but rather, if they were dissatisfied with friends pro∣ceedings, and had any thing to object, let a meeting be ap∣pointed on purpose some other day. So friends offered to give them a meeting another day; which at length was agreed to be at Thomas Ellwood's the week following. Accordingly friends met them there, and the meeting was in the barn; for there came so many, the house could not receive them. After we had sat awhile, they began their jangling. Most of their arrows were shot at me; but the Lord was with me, and gave me strength in his power to cast back their darts of envy and falsehood upon themselves. Their objections were answered; things were opened to the people; and a good opportunity it was, and serviceable to the truth; many that before were weak, were now strength∣ened
<PB N="252" REF="037441_0768_100D935F424F08B0"/>and confirmed; some that were doubting and waver∣ing were satisfied and settled; and faithful friends were refreshed and comforted in the springing of life amongst us: for the power rose, and life sprung, and in the arisings there∣of many living testimonies were borne against that wicked, dividing, rending spirit, which those opposers were joined to and acted by: and the meeting ended to the satisfaction of friends. That night I lodged, with other friends, at Thomas Ellwood's; and the same week I had a meeting again with those opposers at Wickham, where they again shewed their envy, and were made manifest to the upright-hearted.</P>
<P>After I had visited friends in that upper side of Bucking∣hamshire, I called at Henley in Oxfordshire, and went by Causham to Reading, where I was at meeting on first-day, and in the evening had a large meeting with friends. Next day there being another meeting about settling a women's meeting, some of those that had let in the spirit of division fell into jangling, and were disorderly for awhile, till the weight of truth brought them down. After this I passed on, visiting friends, and having meetings in several places, through Berkshire and Wiltshire, till I came to Bristol, which was on the 24th day of the 11th month, just before the fair.</P>
<P>I staid at Bristol the time of the fair, and sometime after. Many sweet and precious meetings we had; many friends being there from several parts of the nation, some on account of trade, and some in the service of truth. Great was the love and unity of friends that abode faithful in the truth, though some who were gone out of the holy unity, and were run into strife, division, and enmity, were rude and abusive, and behaved themselves in a very unchristian manner to∣wards me. But the Lord's power was over all; by which being preserved in the heavenly patience, which can bear injuries for his name's sake, I felt dominion therein over the rough, rude, and unruly spirits; and left them to the Lord, who knew my innocency, and would plead my cause. The more these laboured to reproach and vilify me, the more did the love of friends, that were sincere and upright-hearted, abound towards me; and some, that had been be∣trayed by the adversaries, seeing their envy and rude beha∣viour, broke off from them; who have cause to bless the Lord for their deliverance.</P>
<P>When I left Bristol, I went with Richard Snead to a house of his in the country, and from thence to Hezekiah
<PB N="253" REF="037441_0769_100D9360D63C3AF0"/>Coale's at Winterburn in Gloucestershire, whither came se∣veral friends that were under great sufferings for truth's sake, whom I had invited to meet me there. Stephen Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith, Richard Snead, and I, drew up a breviate of their sufferings, setting forth the illegal proceedings against them; which was delivered to the judges at the assizes at Glouces∣ter; and they promised to put a stop to those illegal pro∣ceedings. Next day we passed to Sudbury, and had a large meeting in the meeting-house, which at that time was of very good service. We went next day to Nathaniel Crips's at Tedbury, and from thence to Nailsworth; where on first-day we had a brave meeting and large. From thence we went to the quarterly meeting at Finchcomb, where were several of the opposite spirit, who (it was thought) intended to have made disturbance amongst friends; but the Lord's power was over, and kept them down, and good ser∣vice for the Lord we had at that meeting. We returned from Einchcomb to Nailsworth, and had another very pre∣cious meeting there, to which friends came from the several meetings thereabouts; which made it very large also.</P>
<P>We went from Nailsworth the first of the first month, 1677-8, and travelled, visiting friends, and having many meetings at Cirencester, Crown-Allins, Cheltenham, Stoke-Orchard, Tewksbury, &amp;c. so went to Worcester, where I had formerly suffered imprisonment above a year for the truth's sake; and friends rejoiced greatly to see me there again. Here I staid several days, and had many very precious meetings in the city, and much service amongst friends. After which I had meetings at Pershore and Eves∣ham; then struck to Ragley in Warwickshire, to visit the lady Conway, who I understood was very desirous to see me, and whom I found tender and loving, and willing to have detained me longer than I had freedom to stay. About two miles from hence I had two meetings at a friend's house, whose name was John Stanley, whither Wil∣liam Dewsbury came, and staid with me about half a day. I visited friends in their meetings at Stratford, Lamcoat, and Armscott (from whence I was sent prisoner to Worces∣ter in the year 1673) and thence passed into Oxfordshire, visiting friends, and having meetings at Sibbard, North-Newton, Banbury, Adderbury, &amp;c. Then visiting friends through Buckinghamshire, at Long-Crendon, Ismer, Men∣dle, Weston, Cholsberry, Chesham, &amp;c. I came to Isaac Penington's, where I staid a few days; then turning into
<PB N="254" REF="037441_0770_100D93638979EB28"/>Hertfordshire, visited friends at Charlewood. Watford, Hempstead, and Market-street, at which places I had meet∣ings with friends. From Market-street I went in the morn∣ing to Luten in Bedfordshire, to see John Crook, with whom I spent good part of the day, and went towards evening to Alban's, where I lay that night at an inn. And visiting friends at South-Mims, Barnet, and Hendon, where I had meetings, I came to London the eighth of the third month. It being the fourth-day, I went to Gracechurch∣street meeting, which was peaceable and well; many friends, not knowing I was come to town, were very joyful to see me there, and the Lord was present with us, refreshing us with his living virtue; blessed be his holy name!</P>
<P>The parliament was sitting when I came to town, and friends having laid their sufferings before them, were waiting on them for relief against the laws made against Popish re∣cusants, which they knew we were not; though some ma∣licious magistrates took advantage to prosecute us in several parts of the nation upon those statutes. Friends being at∣tending that service, when I came, I joined them therein; and some probability there was that something might have been obtained towards friends ease and relief in that case, many of the parliament-men being tender and loving to∣wards us, as believing we were much misrepresented by our adversaries. But when I went one morning with George Whitehead, to the parliament-house, to attend them on friends behalf, on a sudden they were prorogued though but for a short time.</P>
<P>About two weeks after I came to London the yearly meet∣ing began, to which friends came out of most parts of the nation, and a glorious heavenly meeting we had. Oh the glory, majesty, love, life, wisdom and unity, that was amongst us! The power reigned over all, and many testimonies were borne therein against that ungodly spirit which sought to make rents and divisions amongst the Lord's people; but not one mouth was opened amongst us in its, defence, or on its behalf. Good and comfortable accounts also we had, for the most part, from friends in other countries; of which I find a brief account in a letter which soon after I wrote to my wife, the copy whereof here follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear heart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom is my love in the everlasting Seed of life, that reigns over all. Great meetings here have been,
<PB N="255" REF="037441_0771_100D7F9F8B98AC78"/>and the Lord's power hath been stirring through all, the like hath not been. The Lord hath in his power knit friends wonderfully together, and his glorious presence did appear among friends. And now the meetings are over (blessed be the Lord!) in quietness and peace. From Holland I hear that things are well there. Some friends are gone that way, to be at the yearly meeting at Amster∣dam. At Embden, friends that were banished are got into the city again. At Dantzick, friends are in prison, and the magistrates threatened them with harder imprisonment; but the next day the Lutherans rose, and plucked down or defaced the Popish monastery, so they have work enough themselves. The king of Poland did receive my letter, and read it himself; and friends have since printed it in High Dutch. By letters from the half-yearly meeting in Ireland I hear they are all in love there. At Barbadoes friends are in quietness, and their meetings settled in peace. At Antigua also and Nevis truth prospers, and friends have their meetings orderly and well. Likewise in New-England, and other places, things concerning truth and friends are well; and in those places the men's and wo∣men's meeting are settled; blessed be the Lord! So keep in God's power and Seed, that is over all, in whom ye all have life and salvation; for the Lord reigns over all, in his glory, and in his kingdom; glory to his name for ever, Amen! So in haste, with my love to you all, and to all friends.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Johannes III. king of Poland, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>O king!</P>
<P>WE desire thy prosperity both in this life and that which is to come. And we desire that we may have our Christian liberty to serve and worship God under thy dominion: for our principle leads us not to do anything prejudicial to the king or his people. We are a people that exercise a good conscience towards God through his Holy Spirit, and in it do serve, worship, and honour him; and
<PB N="256" REF="037441_0772_100D936596C72188"/>towards men in the things that are equal and just, doing to them as we would have them do unto us; looking unto Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith; which faith purifies our hearts, and brings us to have access to God; without which we cannot please him: by which faith all the just live, as the scripture declares. That which we desire of thee, O king, is, that we may have the liberty of our consciences to serve and worship God, and to pray unto him in our meetings together in the name of Jesus, as he commands: with a promise that he will be in the midst of them. The king, we hope, can∣not but say that this duty and service is due to God and Christ; and we give Caesar his due, and pay our tribute and custom equal with our neighbour, according to our proportion. We never read in all the scriptures of the New Testament, that ever Christ or his disciples did ba∣nish or imprison any that were not of their faith or religi∣on, and would not hear them, or gave any such com∣mand; but, on the contrary, let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harvest, and the harvest is the end of the world. Then Christ will send his angels to sever the wheat from the tares. He rebuked such as would have had fire from heaven to consume those that would not receive Christ; and told them they did not know what spirit they were of; he came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</P>
<P>We desire the king to consider how much persecution has been in Christendom, since the apostles days, concern∣ing religion. Christ said, They should go into everlast∣ing punishment that did not visit him in prison; then what will become of them that imprison him in his mem∣bers, where he is manifest. None can say the world is ended; therefore how will Christendom answer the dread∣ful and terrible God at his day of judgment, that have persecuted one another about religion before the end of the world, under a pretence of plucking up tares; which is not their work, but the angels at the end of the world? Christ commands men to love one another, and to love enemies; and by this they should be known to be his dis∣ciples. O that all Christendom had lived in peace and unity, that they might by their moderation have judged both Turks and Jews; and let all have their liberty, that own God and Christ Jesus, and walk as becomes the glo∣rious gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our desires are,
<PB N="257" REF="037441_0773_100D9367A95252C8"/>that the Lord God of heaven may soften the king's heart to all tender consciences that fear the Lord, and are afraid of disobeying him.</P>
<P>We intreat the king to read some of the noble expres∣sions of several kings, and others, concerning liberty of conscience; and especially Stephanus king of Poland's sayings, viz. <Q>It belongeth not to me to reform the con∣sciences; I have always gladly given that over to God which belongeth to him; and so shall I do now, and also for the future. I will suffer the weeds to grow till the time of harvest, for I know that the number of believ∣ers are but small: therefore,</Q> said he, when some were proceeding in persecution, <Q>I am king of the people, not of their consciences.</Q> He also affirmed, that <Q>religion was not to be planted with fire and sword.</Q> Chron. Li∣berty of Religion, Part 2.</P>
<P>Also a book wrote in French by W. M. anno 1576, hath this sentence, viz. <Q>Those princes that have ruled by gentleness and clemency added to justice, and have exercised moderation and meekness towards their subjects, always prospered and reigned long; but, on the contrary, those princes that have been cruel, unjust, prejudiced, and oppressors of their subjects, have soon fallen, they and their estates, into danger or total ruin.</Q></P>
<P>Veritus saith, <Q>Seeing Christ is a Lamb, whom you profess to be your head and captain, then it behoveth you to be sheep, and to use the same weapons which he made use of: for he will not be a shepherd of wolves and wild beasts, but only of sheep. Wherefore, if you lose the nature of sheep,</Q> said he, <Q>and be changed into wolves and wild beasts, and use fleshly weapons, then will you exclude yourselves out of his calling, and forsake his ban∣ner; and then will not he be your captain,</Q>&amp;c.</P>
<P>Also we find it asserted by king James, in his speech to the parliament, in the year 1609, <Q>That it is a pure rule in divinity, that God never planted his church with vio∣lence of blood.</Q> And further he said, <Q>It was usually the condition of Christians to be persecuted, but not to persecute.</Q></P>
<P>King Charles, in his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pag. 61. said in his prayer to God, <Q>Thou seest how much cruelty amongst Christians is acted under the colour of religion; as if we could not be Christians unless we crucified one another.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="037441_0774_100D9369466154D0"/>
Pag. 28. <Q>Make them at length seriously to consider, that nothing violent nor injurious can be religious.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 70. <Q>Nor is it so proper to hew out religious re∣formation by the sword, as to polish them by fair and equal disputations, among those that are most concerned in the differences, whom not force but reason must con∣vince.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 66. <Q>Take heed that outward circumstances and formalities in religion devour not at all.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 91, 92. <Q>In point of true conscientious tender∣ness I have so often declared, how little I desire my laws and sceptre should intrench on God's sovereignty, who is the only king of conscience.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 123. <Q>Nor do I desire any man should be further subject unto me, than all of us may be subject unto God.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 200. <Q>O thou Sovereign of our souls, the only commander of our consciences!</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 346. (In his Meditations on Death) <Q>It is indeed a sad estate, to have his enemies to be his accusers, par∣ties, and judges.</Q></P>
<P>The prince of Orange testified, Anno 1579, <Q>That it was impossible the land should be kept in peace, except there was a free toleration in the exercise of religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Where hast thou read in thy day (said Menno) in the writings of the apostles, that Christ or the apostles ever cried out to the magistrate for their power against them that would not hear their doctrine, nor obey their words? I know certainly (said he) that where a magistrate shall banish with the sword, there is not the right knowledge, spiritual word, nor church of Christ; it is, Invocate brachium seculare (to invoke the secular arm).</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not Christian-like, but tyrannical (said D. Philip∣son) to banish and persecute people, about faith and reli∣gion; and they that do so are certainly of the Pharisaical generation, who resisted the Holy Ghost.</Q></P>
<P>Erasmus said, <Q>Though they take our monies and goods, they cannot therefore hurt our salvation; they af∣flict us much with prisons, but they do not thereby sepa∣rate us from God.</Q> In de Krydges wrede, fol. 63.</P>
<P>Lucemus said, <Q>He that commandeth any thing where∣with he bindeth the conscience, this is an antichrist.</Q> In de Bemise Disp. fol. 71.</P>
<P>Irenoeus affirmed, <Q>That all forcing of conscience, though it was but a forbidding of the exercise which is
<PB N="259" REF="037441_0775_100D936CD7FBDCB0"/>esteemed by one or another to be necessary to salvation, is in nowise right nor fitting.</Q> He also affirmed, <Q>That through the diversity of religions the kingdom should not be brought into any disturbance.</Q></P>
<P>Constantius the emperor said, <Q>It was enough that he preserved the unity of the faith, that he might be excusa∣ble before the judgment-seat of God; and that he would leave every one to his own understanding, according to the account he will give before the judgment-seat of Christ. Hereto may we stir up people, (said he) not compel them; beseech them to come into the unity of the Christians, but to do violence to them, we will not in any-wise.</Q> Sebast. Frank Chron. fol. 127.</P>
<P>Augustinus said, <Q>Some disturbed the peace of the church, while they went about to root out the tares before their time; and through this error of blindness are they themselves separated so much the more from being united unto Christ.</Q></P>
<P>Retnaldus testified, <Q>That he, who with imprisoning and persecuting seeketh to spread the gospel, and greaseth his hands with blood, shall much rather be looked upon for a wild hunter, than a preacher or a defender of the Christian religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have for a long season determined (said Henry IV. king of France, in his speech to the parliament 1599) to reform the church, which without peace I cannot do: and it is impossible to reform or convert people by violence. I am king, as a shepherd, and will not shed the blood of my sheep: but will gather them through the mildness and goodness of a king, and not through the power of tyran∣ny: and I will give them that are of the reformed reli∣gion, right liberty to live and dwell free, without being examined, perplexed, molested, or compelled to any thing, contrary to their consciences; for they shall have the free exercise of their religion,</Q> &amp;c. [Vid. Chron. Van de Underg. 2 deel, p. 1514.]</P>
<P>Ennius said, <Q>Wisdom is driven out, when the matter is acted by force. And therefore the best of men, and most glorious of princes, were always ready to give tolera∣tion.</Q></P>
<P>Eusebius, in his second book of the life of Constantine, reports these words of the emperor: <Q>Let them which err with joy receive the like fruition of peace and quietness with the faithful, sith the restoring of communication and
<PB N="260" REF="037441_0776_100D936E70557960"/>society may bring them into the right way of truth; let none give molestation to any; let every one do as he de∣termines in his mind. And indeed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is great reason for princes to give toleration to disagreeing persons, whose opinions cannot by fair means be altered: for if the per∣sons be confident, they will serve God according to their persuasions; and if they be publickly prohibited, they will privately convene; and then all those inconvenien∣ces and mischiefs, which are arguments against the per∣mission of conventicles, are arguments for the publick per∣mission of differing religions, &amp;c. they being restrained and made miserable, endears the discontented persons mu∣tually, and makes more hearty and dangerous confedera∣tions.</Q></P>
<Q>The like counsel in the divisions of Germany, at the first reformation, was thought reasonable by the emperor Ferdinand and his excellent son Maximilian; for they had observed, that violence did exasperate, was unblest, unsuccessful, and unreasonable; and therefore they made decrees of toleration.</Q>
<P>The duke of Savoy, repenting of his war undertaken for religion against the Piedmontese, promised them tolera∣tion; and was as good as his word.'</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that till the time of Justinian the em∣peror, Anno Domini 525. <Q>the Catholicks and Nova∣tians had churches indifferently permitted, even in Rome itself.</Q></P>
<Q>And Paul preached the kingdom of God, teaching those things which concerned the Lord Jesus Christ, with all considence, and no man forbad him; and this he did for the space of two years in his own hired house at Rome, and received all that came to him.</Q>
<P>Now, O king, seeing these noble testimonies concerning liberty of conscience of kings, emperors, and others, and the liberty that Paul had at Rome in the days of the hea∣then emperor, our desire is, that we may have the same li∣berty at Dantzick to meet together in our own hired hou∣ses, which cannot be any prejudice either to the king or the city of Dantzick, for us to meet together to wait upon the Lord, and pray unto him, and to serve and worship him in Spirit and truth in our own hired houses; seeing our principle leads us to hurt no man, but to love our enemies, and to pray for them, yea, them that persecute us. Therefore, O king, consider, and the city of Dant∣zick,
<PB N="261" REF="037441_0777_100D93706BDC35E0"/>would you not think it hard for others to force you from your religion to another, contrary to your conscien∣ces? And if it be so, that you would think it hard to you, then <Q>do you unto others as you would have them do unto you,</Q> do not you that unto others which you would not have men do unto you; for that is the royal law, which ought to be obeyed.

<P>I continued yet in and about London some weeks, the parliament sitting again, and friends attending to get some redress of our sufferings, which about this time were very great and heavy upon many friends in divers parts of the nation; they being very unduly prosecuted upon the sta∣tutes
<PB N="262" REF="037441_0778_100D9372075F63E0"/>made against popish recusants; though our persecutors could not but know friends were utterly against popery, having borne testimony against it in word and writing, and suffered under it. But though many of the members of parliament in either house were kind to friends, and willing to have done something for their ease; yet having much business they were hindered from doing the good they would, so that the sufferings upon friends were continued.</P>
<P>But that which added much to the grief and exercise of friends was that some, who made professio of the same truth with us, being gone from the simplicity of the gospel into fleshly liberty, and labouring to draw others after them, did oppose the order and discipline which God by his pow∣er had set up and established in his church; and made a great noise and clamour against prescriptions; whereby they easily drew after them such as were loosely inclined, and de∣sired a broader way than the path of truth to walk in. Some also that were more simple, but young in truth, or weak in judgment, were apt to be betrayed by them, not knowing the depths of Satan in these wiles: for whose sake I was moved to write the following paper, for the undeceiving the deceived, and opening the understandings of the weak in this matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL that deny prescriptions without distinction, may as well deny all the scriptures, which were given forth by the power and Spirit of God. For do they not prescribe how men should walk towards God and man, both in the Old Testament and in the New? Yea, from the very first promise of Christ in Genesis, what people ought to believe and trust in; and all along, till ye come to the prophets? Did not the Lord prescribe to his peo∣ple by the fathers, and then by his prophets? Did he not prescribe to the people how they should walk, though they turned against the prophets in the old covenant for declaring or prescribing to them the way how they might walk to please God, and keep in favour with him? In the days of Christ, did he not prescribe and teach how people should walk and believe? and after him, did not the apos∣tles prescribe unto people how they might come to be∣lieve, and receive the gospel and the kingdom of God, directing unto that which would give them the knowledge of God, and how they should walk in the new covenant in the days of the gospel, and by what way they should
<PB N="263" REF="037441_0779_100D937451B737A0"/>come to the holy city? And did not the apostles send forth their decrees by faithful chosen men (that had ha∣zarded their lives for Christ's sake) to the churches, by which they were established? So you, that deny prescrip∣tions given forth by the power and Spirit of God, do thereby oppose the Spirit that gave them forth in all the holy men of God. Were there not some all along in the days of Moses, in the days of the prophets, in the days of Christ, and in the days of his apostles, who did withstand that which they gave forth from the Spirit of God? And hath there not been the like since the days of the apostles? How many have risen, since truth appeared, to oppose the order which stands in the power and Spirit of God? who are but in the same spirit which hath opposed the Spirit of God all along from the beginning. See what names or titles the Spirit of God gave that opposing spirit in the old covenant, and also in the new; which is the same now; for after the Lord had given sorth the old covenant, there were some among themselves that did oppose; which were worse than publick enemies. And likewise in the days of the new covenant, in the gospel-times, you may see what sort opposed Christ and the apostles after they came to some sight of the truth; and how they turned against Christ and his apostles? See what liberty they pleaded for and ran into in the apostles days, who could not abide the cross, the yoke of Jesus. We see the same rough and high spirit crie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now for liberty (which the power and Spi∣rit of Christ cannot give) and cries, "Imposition," yet is imposing; cries, "Liberty of conscience," and yet is op∣posing liberty of conscience; cries against prescriptions, and yet is prescribing both in words and writing. So with the everlasting power and Spirit of God this spirit is fathomed, its rise beginning, and end; and it is judged. This Spirit cries, <Q>We must not judge conscience, we must not judge matters of faith, we must not judge spirits, nor religions,</Q> &amp;c. Yes: they that are in the pure Spirit and power of God, which the apostles were in judge of conscience, whether it be a seared conscience, or a tender conscience; they judge of faith, whether it be a dead one, or a living one; they judge of religion, whether it be vain, or pure and undefiled; they judge of spirits, and try them. whether they be of God, or no; they judge of hope, whe∣ther it be that of hypocrites, or the true hope that purifies. even as God is pure; they judge of belief, whether it be
<PB N="264" REF="037441_0780_100D9377815A11C0"/>that which is born of God, and overcometh the world, or that which runs into the spirit of the world, which lusts to envy, and doth not overcome the world; they judge of worships, whether they be will-worships, and the worship of the beast and dragon, or the worship of God in Spirit and in truth; they judge of angels, whether they be fallen, or those that keep their habitation; they judge the world, that grieves and quenches the Spirit, hates the light, turns the grace of God into wantonness, and resists the Holy Ghost. They judge of the hearts, ears and lips, which are circumcised, and which are uncircumcised. They judge of ministers, apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and messengers, whether they be of Satan or of Christ. Judge of differences in outward things, in the church or elsewhere; yea, the least member of the church hath power to judge of such things, Laving the one true measure and true weight to weigh things and measure things withal, without respect to persons. This judgment is given, and all these things are done by the same power and Spirit the apostles were in. Such also can judge of election and reprobation, and who keep their habitation, and who not; who are Jews, and who are of the synagogue of Satan; who are in the doctrine of Christ, and who are in the doctrines of devils; who prescribes and declares things from the power and Spirit of God, to pre∣serve all in the power and Spirit of God, and who pre∣scribes and declares things from a loose spirit, to let all loose from under the yoke of Christ, the power of God, into looseness and liberty. These likewise can judge and discern who brings people into the possession of the gospel of light and life, over death and darkness, and into the truth where the devil cannot get in; and who brings them into the possession of death and darkness, out of the glori∣ous liberty of the gospel, and of Jesus Christ, his faith, truth, Spirit, light, and grace. For there is no true liber∣ty but in that; and that liberty answers the grace, the truth, the light, the Spirit, the faith, the gospel of Christ in every man and woman, and is the yoke to the contrary in every man and woman. That makes it rage, and swell, and puff up; for that is restless, unruly, out of patience, and ready to curse his God, and that which reigns over him, because it hath not its will. It works with all sub∣tilty and evasion with its restless spirit, to get in and defile the minds of the simple, and to make rapes upon the vir∣gin minds. But as they receive the heavenly wisdom, by
<PB N="265" REF="037441_0781_100D9379145EE7A0"/>which all things were made (which wisdom is above that spirit) through this wisdom they will be preserved over that spirit. And Christ hath given judgment to his saints in his church, though he be judge of all; and the saints, in the power and Spirit of God, had and have power to judge of words and manners, of lives and conversations, growths, and states, from a child to a father in the truth; and to whom they are a savour of death, and to whom they are a savour of life; and who serve the Lord Jesus Christ, and preach him, and who preach themselves, and serve themselves; and who talk of the light, of faith, of the gospel, of hope, of grace, and preach such things; yet in their works and lives deny them all, and God and Christ, and preach up liberty, from that in themselves to that in others, which should be under the yoke and cross of Christ, the power of God. So the saints in the power and Spirit of Christ can discern and distinguish who serves God and Christ, and who serves him not; and can put a distinction between the prophane and the holy. But such as have lost their eye-salve, and their sight is grown dim, lose this judgment, discerning, and distinction in the church of Christ; and such come to be spewed out of Christ's mouth, except they repent: and if not, they come to corrupt the earth, and burden it, that it vomits them out of it. Therefore all are exhorted to keep in the power and Spirit of Christ Jesus, in the word of life and the wis∣dom of God (which is above that which is below) in which they may keep their heavenly understandings and heaven∣ly discernings; and so set the heavenly spiritual judgment over that which is for judgment, which dishonours God, which leads into loose and false liberty; out of the unity which stands in the heavenly Spirit, which brings to be conformable to the image of the Son of God, and his gos∣pel, the power of God (which was before the devil was) and his truth (which the devil is out of) in which all are of one mind, heart, and soul, and come to drink into one Spirit, being baptized into one Spirit, and so into one bo∣dy, which Christ is the head of; and so keep one fellow∣ship in the Spirit, and unity in the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, the Prince of Princes peace. And those that cry so much against judging, and are afraid of judg∣ment, whether they be apostles, professors, or prophane, are the most judging with the censorious salse spirits and judgment; yet cannot bear the true judgment of the Spirit
<PB N="266" REF="037441_0782_100D937B4DED75D0"/>of God, nor stand in his judgment. This hath been ma∣nifest from the beginning, they having the false measures and the false weights: for none have the true measure and the true weight, but who keep in the light, power, and Spi∣rit of Christ. There is a loose spirit that cries for liberty, and against prescriptions, yet is prescribing ways, both by words and writings. The same spirit cries against judging, and would not be judged, yet is judging with a wrong spirit. This is given forth in reproof to that spirit.</P>

<P>KEEP in the tender life of the Lamb, over that unru∣ly, puffed up and swelling spirit, whose work is for strife, contention, and division, drawing into looseness and false liberty, under a pretence of conscience, and endan∣gers the spoiling of youth. Those that encourage them will be guilty of their destruction, and set up a sturdy will, instead of conscience, in their rage and passion; which will quench the universal Spirit in themselves, and in eve∣ry man and woman; and so that Spirit shall not have li∣berty in themselves, nor in others; thus they shut up the kingdom of heaven in themselves, and also in others. So a loose spirit getting up under a pretence of liberty of con∣science, or a stubborn will, making profession of the words of truth in a form without power, all looseness and vileness will be sheltered and covered under this pretence, which is for eternal judgment: for that doth dishonour God. Therefore keep to the tender Spirit of God in all humility, that in it you may know that ye are all members of one an∣other, and all have an office in the church of Christ. All these living members know one another in the Spirit, and not in the flesh.

<P>I went from Hertford to a meeting at Rabley Heath, and thence to Edward Crouch's of Stevenage. Next day I went to Baldock where I had a meeting that evening, and after had meetings at Hitchin and Ashwell. Then passing through part of Bedfordshire, where I had a meeting or two, I went to Huntingdon, in which county I staid several days, having many meetings, and much service amongst friends;
<PB N="268" REF="037441_0784_100D9381147EBFF8"/>labouring to convince gainsayers, and to confirm and strength∣en friends in the way and work of the Lord. At Ives in Huntingdonshire George Whitehead came to me, and tra∣velled with me in the work of the Lord five or six days in that county, and some part of Northamptonshire. Leaving me in Great Bowden in Leicestershire, he went towards Westmoreland. I staid in Leicestershire, visiting friends at Saddington, Wigston, Knighton, Leicester, Sileby, Swan∣nington, and divers other places; where I had very preci∣ous meetings, and good service amongst friends and others: for there was great openness, and many weighty and excel∣lent truths did the Lord give me to deliver amongst them.</P>
<P>At Leicester I went to the gaol to visit the friends in pri∣son for the testimony of Jesus, with whom I spent some time, encouraging them in the Lord to persevere steadfastly and faithfully in their testimony, and not to be weary of suf∣fering for his sake. And when I had taken my leave of the friends, I spoke with the gaoler, desiring him to be kind to them, and let them have what liberty he could, to visit their families sometimes.</P>
<P>I had a meeting or two in Warwickshire, and then went into Stassordshire, where I had several sweet and opening meetings, both for gathering into truth, and establishing therein. While I was in Stassordshire, I was moved to give forth the following paper:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends of the quarterly and monthly meetings every where: My desire is, that you may all strive to be of one mind in the Lord's power and truth, which is peaceable (into which strife and enmity cannot come) and also in the wisdom of God, which is pure, peaceable, and easy to be intreated (which is above that which is below, that is earthly, devilish, and sensual) and that in this hea∣venly wisdom that is peaceable, and easy to be intreated, you may be all ordered, and do what ye do to God's glo∣ry. And dear friends, if there should happen at any time any thing that tends to strife. dispute, or contention in your monthly or quarterly meetings, let it be referred to half a dowen, or such a like number to debate and end out of yoar meetings, as it was at first, that all your monthly and quarterly meetings may be kept peaceable. And then they may inform the meeting what they have done; that the weak and youth amongst you may not be hurt, through hearing of strife on contention in your meetings,
<PB N="269" REF="037441_0785_100D9382A87B5F70"/>where no strife or contention ought to be: but all to go on, and determine things in one mind, in the power of God, the gospel-order; in which gospel of peace ye will preserve the peace of all your meetings. If any man or woman have any thing against any one, let them speak to one an∣other, and end it betwixt themselves; if they cannot so end it, let them take two or three to end it. In case these de∣termine it not, let it be laid before the church; and let half a dozen, or a proper number out of your monthly or quarterly meeting hear it, and finally end it, without res∣pect of persons. Let all prejudice be laid aside and buri∣ed; also all shortness one towards another; and let love, which is not puffed up, envies not, seeks not her own, but bears all things, have the dominion in all your meetings; for that doth edify the body which Christ is the head of, and this will rule over all sounding brass and tinkling cym∣bals. This love will suffer long, and is kind; will keep down that which would vaunt itself, be puffed up, behave itself unseemly, or is easily provoked: it hath a sway over all such fruits which are not of the Spirit, the fruit of which is love, &amp;c. And that with this Holy Spirit ye may all be baptized into one body, and be made to drink into one Spirit; in which Spirit ye will have unity, in which is the bond of the King of kings and the Lord of lords his peace. They that dwell in love, dwell in God, for God is love: therefore let every one keep his habita∣tion. My love to you in Christ Jesus, the everlasting Seed, which is over all.</P>

<P>Out of Stassordshire I went to visit John Gratton at Mo∣niash in Derbyshire, with whom I tarried one night, and went next day to William Shaw's, of the Hill in Yorkshire, where I appointed a meeting to be on first-day following. Many friends out of Derbyshire, and from several meetings in Yorkshire came, and a precious, comfortable meeting it was; wherein was opened the blessed estate that man was in before he fell; the means by which he fell, the miserable condition into which he sell, and the right way of coming out of it into a happy state again by Christ, the promised Seed.</P>
<P>I spent about two weeks in Yorkshire, and many heaven∣ly
<PB N="270" REF="037441_0786_100D938520E03AB0"/>meetings I had in that county. Then visting Robert Widders at Kellet in Lancashire, I passed to Arnside in Westmoreland, where I had a precious living meeting in the Lord's blessed power, to the great satisfaction and comfort of friends, who came from divers parts to it. The next day I went to Swarthmore: and it being the meeting-day there, I had a sweet opportunity with friends; our hearts being opened in the love of God, and his blessed life flowing amongst us.</P>
<P>I had not been long at Swarthmore ere a concern came upon me to visit the churches of Christ, by an epistle as sol∣loweth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you is my love in the heavenly Seed, in whom all nations are blessed. Oh, keep all in this Seed, in which ye are blessed, and in which Abraham and all the saithful were blessed, without the deeds of the law: for the promise was and is to and with the Seed, and not with the law of the fist covenant. In this Seed all nations and ye are blessed, which bruiseth the head of the seed that brought the curse, and separated man from God. This is the Seed which reconciles you to God; and this is the Seed in which ye are blessed both in temporals and spirituals; through which ye have an inheritance among the sanctified, that cannot be defiled, neither can any defiled thing enter into its possession; for all defilements are out of his Seed. This is that which leavens into a new lump, and bruiseth the head of the wicked seed that leavens into the old lump, upon whom the sun of righteousness goes down and sets, but never goes down and sets to them that walk in the Seed in which all nations are blessed; by which Seed they are brought up to God, which puts down that seed which se∣parated them from God, so that there comes to be nothing be∣twixt them and God. Now all my dear friends, my desires are, that ye may all be valiant in this heavenly Seed for God and his truth upon the earth, and spread it abroad, an∣swering that of God in all; that with it the minds of peo∣ple may be turned towards the Lord, that he may come to be known, served, and worshipped, and that ye may all be as the salt of the earth, to make the unseasoned savoury. And in the name of Jesus keep your meetings, who are gathered into it, in whose name ye have salvation; he be∣ing in the midst of you, whose name is above every name
<PB N="271" REF="037441_0787_100D93882E9913C0"/>under the whole heaven. So ye have a Prophet, Bishop, Shepherd, Priest, and Counsellor (above all the counsel∣lors, priests, bishops, prophets, and shepherds under the whole heaven) to exercise his offices among you, in your meetings, gathered in his name. For Christ's meeting and gathering is above all the meetings and gatherings under the whole heaven; and his body, his church, and he the head of it, is above all the bodies, churches, and heads under the whole heaven. And the faith that Christ is the author of, and the worship that he hath set up, and his fellowship in the gospel, is above all historical faiths, and the faiths that men have made, together with their wor∣ships and fellowships under the whole heaven. And now, dear friends, keep your men's and women's meetings in the power of God, the gospel, the authority of them, which brings life and immortality to light in you; and this gos∣pel, the power of God, will preserve you in life and in immortality (which hath brought it to light in you) that ye may see over him that hath darkened and kept from the knowledge of the things of God: for it is he and his instruments (which hath darkened you from life and im∣mortality) that would throw down your men's and wo∣men's meetings (which were set up in the power of God, the gospel) and would darken you again from this life and immortality which the gospel hath brought to light, and will preserve you therein, as your faith stands in this power of God, the gospel, in which every one sees your work and service for God. Every heir in the power of God, the gospel, hath right to this authority, which is not of man not by man; which gospel, the power of God, is everlasting, an everlasting order, an everlasting fellowship: and in the gospel is everlasting joy, comfort, and peace, which will outlast all those joys, comforts, and peaces that will have an end, and that spirit also that opposes its order and glorious fellowship, peace and comfort in it. And, my dear friends, my desire is, that ye may keep in the unity of the Spirit, that baptizes you all into one body, which Christ is the heavenly and spiritual head of, so that ye may see and bear witness to your heavenly and spiritu∣al head, and so all drink into the one Spirit, which all people on the earth are not like to do, while they grieve, quench, and rebel against it, nor to be baptized into one body, and to keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, yea the King of kings and Lord of lords
<PB N="272" REF="037441_0788_100D938A41B13658"/>his peace; which is the duty of all true Christians to keep, who are inwardly united to Christ. My love to you all in the everlasting Seed.</P>

<P>WHO are sufferers for the Lord Jesus sake, and for the testimony of his truth, the Lord God Almighty with his power uphold and support you in all your trials and sufferings, and give you patience and content in his will that ye may stand valiant for Christ and his truth upon the earth, over the persecuting destroying spirit, which makes to suffer in Christ (who bruises the head) in whom ye have both election and salvation. For his elect's sake the Lord hath done much from the foundation of the world, as may be seen throughout the scriptures of truth. They that touch them touch the apple of God's eye, they are so tender to him; and therefore it is good for his suf∣fering children to trust in the Lord, and to wait upon him; for they shall be as mount Sion, that cannot be removed from Christ their rock and salvation, the soundation of all the elect of God, of the prophets and apostles, and of God's people now and to the end; glory to the Lord and the Lamb over all! Remember my dear love to all friends, and do not think the time long; for all time is in the Fa∣ther's hand, his power. Therefore keep the word of pa∣tience, and exercise that gift. The Lord strengthen you in your sufferings, in his holy Spirit of faith. Amen.</P>

Several epistles also I wrote to friends in this time. One was to the yearly meeting held in London this year, 1679; a copy of which here follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO are assembled together in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, fill all your hearts, and establish you in his grace, mercy, and peace upon Christ, the holy living Rock and Foundation, who is the First and Last, and over all the foundations and rocks in the whole world; a Rock and Foundation of life for all the living to build upon, which stands sure in his heavenly, divine light, which is the life in him; by whom all things were made, who is the precious Stone laid in Sion (and not in the world) which all the wise master∣builders rejected, who pretended to build people up to heaven with the words of the prophets, and the law from mount Sinai, but out of the life of both: therefore such builders could not receive the law of life from Christ, the precious Stone laid in Sion, nor the word from heavenly Jerusalem. But you, my dear friends, that have received this law from heavenly Sion, and the word from heavenly Jerusalem, in the new convenant, where the life and sub∣stance is enjoyed, you see the end and abolishing of the Jews law and ceremonies from mount Sinai. And there∣fore my desire is, that you may all keep in the law of life and love, which ye have in Christ Jesus, by which love the body is edified, knit, and united together to Christ Jesus, the Head. Which love doth bear all things, fulfils the law, will preserve all in humility, and in it to be of one mind, heart, and soul. So all may come to drink into that one Spirit, that doth baptize them and circumcise them, plunging down and cutting off the body of the sins of the flesh, that is got up in man and woman by their transgressing of God's commands. So that in this holy pure Spirit all may serve and worship the pure God in spirit and in truth. which is over all the worships that are out of God's Spirit and his truth. In this Spirit ye will all have a spiritual unity and fellowship over all the fellow∣ships of the unclean spirits, which are out of truth in the world. By this holy Spirit all your hearts, minds, and
<PB N="274" REF="037441_0790_100D938E7275E860"/>souls may be knit together to Christ, from whence it comes; and by the grace and truth, which is come by Jesus Christ, which all should be under the teachings of in the new covenant, and not under the law, as the outward Jews were in the old covenant. By this grace and truth in the new covenant, all may be made God's free men and women, to serve God in the new life, the new and living way; shewing forth the fruits of the new heart and new Spirit, in the new covenant, over death and darkness. Glory be to the Lord for ever! In this grace and truth is heavenly, gracious, and true liberty to every spiritual mind, which makes you free from him that is out of truth, where your bondage was. Also your liberty in the holy, divine, and precious faith, which gives you victory over that which once separated you from God and Christ, by which faith ye have access to God again through Jesus Christ. So in this divine and holy faith, ye have divine, holy, and precious liberty, yea and victory over him that separated you from God; and this faith is held in a pure conscience. So the liberty in the spirit of God is in that which baptizes and plunges down sin and iniquity, and puts off the body of death and sins of the flesh, that are got up by transgressing God's command. And also the liberty of the gospel, which is sent from heaven by the Holy Ghost, which is the power of God, which was and is again to be preached to all nations; in this gospel is the true liberty, and the gospel-fellowship and order. So that the evil spirit or conscience, or false dead faith, that which is ungracious, out of truth, and not in the Spirit of God, nor in his gospel, nor in the divine faith, its liberty is in the darkness; for all true liberty is in the gospel, and in the truth that makes free; in the faith, in the grace, and in Christ Jesus, who destroys the devil and his works, that hath brought all mankind into bondage. So in this hea∣venly, peaceable Spirit, truth, and faith, which works by love, and in the gospel of peace, and in Christ Jesus is all the saints peace, and pure, true, and holy liberty; in which they have salt, some, feeling, discerning, and savour, yea and unity and fellowship one with another, and with the Son and the Father, that heavenly, eternal fellowship. So all being subject to the grace and truth, and to the faith and gospel (the power of God) and to his good Spirit, in this they distinguish all true, pure, and holy liberty from that which is false. This will bring all to sit low; for pa∣tience
<PB N="275" REF="037441_0791_100D93909D3F55D0"/>runs the race, and the Lamb must have the victory; and not the rough, unruly, and vain talkers, unbaptized, uncircumcised, and unsantified. Such travel not in the way of regeneration, but in the way of unregeneration: neither go they down into the death with Christ by bap∣tism. Such are not like to reign with him in his resur∣rection, who are not buried with him in baptism. There∣fore all must go downward into the death of Christ, and be crucified with him, if they will arise and follow him in the regeneration before they come to reign with him. And, friends, many may have precious openings; but I desire all may be comprehended in that which doth open to them, and that they may all keep in the daily cross; then they keep in the power that kills and crucifies that which would lead them amongst the beasts and goats, to leaven them into their rough, unruly spirit; that through the cross, the power of God, that may be crucified, and they in the power might follow the Lamb. For the power of God keeps all in order, subjection, and humility, in that which is lovely, virtuous, decent, comely, temperate, and moderate; so that their moderation comes to appear to all men. My desire is, that all your lights may shine as from a city set upon a hill, that cannot be hid; and that ye may be the salt of the earth, to salt, season, and make it savoury to God, and you all seasoned with it. Then all your sa∣crifices will be a sweet savour to the Lord, and ye will be as the lilies and roses, and garden of God, which gives a sweet smell unto him: whose garden is preserved by his power, the hedge that hedges out all the unruly and un∣savoury, the destroyers and hurters of the vines, buds, and plants, and God's tender blade, which springs up from his seed of life, who waters it with his heavenly water and word of life every moment, that they may grow and be fruitful; that so he may have a pleasant and fruitful garden. Here all are kept fresh and green, being watered every moment with the everlasting holy water of life from the Lord, the fountain. My dear friends, my desire is, that this hea∣venly seed, that bruises down the head of the serpent both within and without, may be your crown and life, and ye in him one another's crown and joy, to the praise of the Lord God over all, blessed for evermore. This holy seed will outlast and wear out all that which the evil seed since the fall of man hath brought forth and set up. As every one hath received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him
<PB N="276" REF="037441_0792_100D939356E0F6D0"/>in the humility which he teaches: and shun the occasions of strife, vain janglings, and disputings with men of cor∣rupt minds, who are destitute of the truth; for the truth is peaceable, the gospel is a peaceable habitation in the power of God; his wisdom is peaceable and gentle, and his kingdom stands in peace. Oh! his glory shines over all his works! in Christ Jesus ye will have peace, who is not of the world; yea a peace that the world cannot take away; for the peace which ye have from him was be∣fore the world was, and will be when it is gone. This keeps all in that which is weighty and substantial over all chaff. Glory to the Lord God over all for ever and ever! Amen.</P>
<P>And now, my dear friends, the Lord doth require more of you than he doth of other people, because he hath com∣mitted more to you. He requires the fruits of his Spirit, of the light, of the gospel, of the grace, and of the truth; for herein is he glorified (as Christ said) in your bringing forth much fruit, fruits of righteousness, holiness, godliness, virtue, truth, and purity; so that ye may answer that which is of God in all people. Be valiant for his everlasting, glorious gosp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, in God's holy Spirit and truth, keeping in the unity, and in the holy Spirit, light, and life, which is over death and darkness, and was before death and dark∣ness were. In this Spirit we have the bond of peace, which cannot be broken except ye go from the Spirit, and then ye lose this unity and bond of peace, which ye have from the Prince of peace.</P>
<P>The world also expects more from friends than from other people; because you profess more. Therefore you should be more just than others in your words and dealings, more righteous, holy and pure in your lives and conver∣sations, so that your lives and conversations may preach. For the world's tongues and mouths have preached long enough; but their lives and conversations have denied what their tongues have professed and declared.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, strive to excel one another in virtue, that ye may grow in love, that excellent way which unites all to Christ and God. Stand up for God's glory, and mind that which concerns the Lord's honour, that in no wise his power may be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed, nor his name evil spoken of by any evil talkers or walkers; but that in all things God may be honoured, and ye may glorify him in your bodies, souls and spirits, the little time ye have to live. My love
<PB N="277" REF="037441_0793_100D939508A4FF58"/>to you all in the holy Seed of Life, that reigns over all, and is the first and last, in whom ye all have life and sal∣vation, and your election and peace with God, through Jesus Christ, who destroys him that hath been betwixt you and God; so that nothing may be betwixt you and the Lord but Christ Jesus. Amen.</P>
<P>My life and love is to you all, and amongst you all. The Lord God Almighty by his mighty power, by which he hath preserved his people unto this day, preseve and keep you all in his power, and peaceable holy truth, in unity and fellowship one with another, and with the Son and the Father.

The next day having a sense upon me that some who had received the truth, and had openings thereof, for want of keeping low had run out therefrom, I was moved to give forth the following epistle, as a <Q>warning and exhortation to all to dwell in humility.</Q></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord in his tender mercies hath visited with the day-spring from on high, and hath opened you to confess and bow to his name; keep low in your minds, and learn of Christ who teacheth you humility, to keep in it; so that in no wise ye that be younger be ex∣alted, puffed up, or conceited through your openings, and by that means lose your conditions, by being carried up into presumption; then fall into despair, and so abuse the power of God. For it was the apostles care, that none should abuse the power of the Lord God; but in all things their faith was to stand therein, that they all might be comprehended into the truth which they spoke to others, that they might not be preachers to others and themselves cast-aways. Therefore it doth concern you to be comprehended into that which ye preach to others, and keep low in it; then the God of truth will exalt the hum∣ble in his truth, light, grace, power, and Spirit, and in his wisdom to his glory. Here all are kept in their measures of grace, light, faith, and the Spirit of Christ, the heavenly and spiritual Man. So let none quench the Spirit, nor its motions, nor grieve it, nor err from it; but be led by it, which keeps every one in their tents; which Holy Spirit of God giveth them an understanding, how to serve, wor∣ship, and please the holy, pure God, their Maker and Creator in Christ Jesus, and how to wait, speak, and an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer the Spirit of God in his people: in which holy Spi∣rit is the holy unity and fellowship. The holy Spirit teacheth the holy, gentle, meek, and quiet lowly mind to answer the seed that Christ hath sown upon all grounds; and to answer the light, grace, and Spirit, and the gospel in every creature, though they are gone from the Spirit, grace, light, and gospel in the heart. So by holy walk∣ing all may come to do it, as well as by holy preaching, that God in all things may be glorified by you, and that ye may bring forth fruits to his praise. Amen.</P>

About the latter end of this year I was moved of the Lord to travel into the south again. I set forward the be∣ginning of the first month, 1679-80, and passing through part of Westmoreland and Lancashire, I visited friends at several meetings, and came into Yorkshire. Divers large and weighty meetings I had in Yorkshire, before I came to York city. When I came there it was the assize-time, and there being many friends in prison for truth's sake, I put those at liberty upon drawing up the sufferings of the friends in prison, that they might be laid before the judges; and I affisted them therein. The quarterly meeting of friends was also at that time, so I had a brave opportunity amongst them. Many weighty and serviceable things did the Lord open through me to the meeting, relating to the inward state of man; how man by faith in Christ comes to be graft∣ed into him, and made a member of his spiritual body; and also the outward state of the church, how each member ought to walk and act, according to its place in the body. I spent several days in York, having divers meetings; and all was peaceable and well. I went also to the castle, to visit the prisoners; with whom I spent some time, encou∣raging and strengthening them in their testimony.</P>
<P>Then leaving York, I travelled southward, having meet∣ings amongst friends, till I came to Burton in Lincolnshire; where on first-day I had a large and precious meeting. Then turning into Nottinghamshire, I travelled through good part of that county, in which I had several very good meetings, and then passed into Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Warwickshire, having meetings all along as I went, till I came to Warwick: there William Dewsbury came to me, and several other friends; and we had a little meeting in that town. Then passing through Southam and Radway, at each of which places I had a very good meeting, I came to Nathaniel Ball's, of North-Newton, in Oxfordshire, and so to Banbury to a monthly meeting there. After I had visited friends at their meetings in the bordering parts of Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Northamptonshire, I pas∣sed to Richard Baker's, of Biddlesden, in Buckinghamshire; and the next day, being first-day, I had a very large meet∣ing in Biddlesden, at an old abbey-house, which a friend rented and dwelt in. Many friends and people came to this meeting out of Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and the parts adjacent; and of good service it was. After this, I visited friends in those parts, having meetings at Lilling∣stone,
<PB N="280" REF="037441_0796_100D939BCB273598"/>Lovel, and Bugbrook. Then going to Stony-strat∣for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I went into some parts of Bedfordshire, till I came to Edward Chester's of Dunstable. Whence passing on by Market-street, I had a meeting at Albans; and calling on friends at Mims and Barnet, I came to the widow Haly's, at Guttershedge, in Hendon, Middlesex, on a seventh-day night, and had a very large and good meeting there the day following.</P>
<P>I passed from thence to London the third-day following, and went directly to the Peel-meeting at John Elson's, and next morning to the meeting at Gracechurch-street, which was very large and quiet; and friends rejoiced in the Lord to see me. The yearly meeting was in the week following, to which many friends came out of most parts of the nation, and a blessed opportunity the Lord gave us together; where∣in the ancient love was sweetly felt, and the heavenly life flowed abundantly over all. After the yearly meeting, I continued about a month or five weeks in and about Lon∣don, labouring in the work of the Lord both in and out of meetings; for besides the publick testimony, which the Lord gave me to bear both to friends and to the world in meet∣ings, I had much service lay upon me with respect to friends sufferings, in seeking to get ease and liberty for them in this and other nations. Much pains and time I spent while I was at London, in writing letters to friends in divers parts of England, and in Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and several other parts of America.</P>
<P>After this I was moved of the Lord to visit friends in some parts of Surrey and Sussex. I went to Kingston by water, and tarried certain days; for while I was there, the Lord laid it upon me to write both to the great Turk and the dey of Algiers severally, to warn them and the people under them to turn from their wickedness, and fear the Lord, and do justly, lest the judgments of God should come upon them, and destroy them without remedy. To the Algerines I wrote more particularly, concerning the cruelty they exercised towards friends and others, whom they held captives in Algiers. When I had finished that service, and visited friends in their meetings at Kingston, I went further into the country, and had meetings amongst friends at Wor∣plesdon, Guildsord, Esher, Capell, Patchgate, Worming∣hurst. Bletchington, Horsham, I field, Ryegate, Gatton, &amp;c. and so came back to Kingston again, and from thence to Hammersmith. And having spent some days in the service
<PB N="281" REF="037441_0797_100D939DE6808588"/>of truth amongst friends at Hammersmith, Battersea. Wands∣worth, and thereabouts I crossed over, by Kensington, to Hendon, where I had a very good meeting on first-day; and went from thence to London.</P>
<P>When I had been about ten days in London, I was drawn again to visit friends in the country; and went to Edmonton to Christopher Taylor's, who kept a school for the education of friends children. I had some service amongst the youth, and then went towards Hertford, visit∣ing friends in the way. At Hertford I met with John Story, and some others of his party; but the testimony of truth went over them, and kept them down, so that the meeting was quiet. It was on a first-day, and the next day being the men's and women's meeting for business, I visited them also; and the rather because some in that place had let in a disesteem of them. Whereupon I was moved to open the service of those meetings, and the usefulness and benefit thereof to the church of Christ, as the Lord opened the thing in me; and it was of good service to friends. I had a meeting also with some of those that were gone into strife and contention, to shew them wherein they were wrong; and having cleared myself of them. I left them to the Lord. After another publick meeting in the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> returned to∣wards London by Waltham-abbey, where I had a publick meeting the first-day following, and another with friends in the evening. Next day I went to Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opher Taylor's at Edmonton, and staid a day or two, having some things upon me to write for the service of truth. When I had finished that service, I went to London by Shacklewell, where was a school kept by friends, for the breeding up young maidens that were friends daughters.</P>
<P>I abode at London most part of this winter, having much service for the Lord there, both in and out of meetings; for as it was a time of great sufferings among friends, I was drawn in spirit to visit friends meetings more frequently, to encourage and strengthen them by exhortation and exam∣ple. The parliament was also sitting, and firends were di∣ligent to wait upon them, to lay their grievances before them. We received fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts almost every day of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad sufferings friend und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rwent in many parts of the na∣tion.

<PB N="282" REF="037441_0798_100D939F847910B8"/>with such members of either house as would hear our just complaints. And indeed some of the members of each house were very courteous, and appeared willing to help us if they could; but the parliament being then earnest in exa∣mining the popish plot. and contriving ways to discover such as were popishly affected, our adversaries took advan∣tages against us (because they knew we could not swear nor fight) to expose us to those penalties that were made against Papists; though they knew in their consciences we were no Papists, and had experience that we were no plotters. To clear our innocency and stop the mouths of our adversaries, I drew up a short paper to be delivered to the parliament; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>IT is our principle and testimony to deny and renounce all plots and plotters against the king, or any of his subjects; for we have the Spirit of Christ, by which we have the mind of Christ, who came to save men's lives, and not to destroy them. We desire the safety of the king and all his subjects. Wherefore we do declare, that we will endeavour, to our power, to save and defend him and them, by discovering all plots and plotters, which shall come to our knowledge, that would destroy the king or his subjects. This we do sincerely offer unto you. But as to swearing and fighting, which in tenderness of con∣science we cannot do, ye know that we have suffered these many years for our conscientious refusal thereof. And now that the Lord hath brought you together, we disire you to relieve and free us from those sufferings, and that ye will not put upon us to do those things which we have suffered so much and so long already for not doing; for if ye do, ye will make our sufferings and bonds stronger in∣stead of relieving us.</P>

<P>About this time I received two very envious books writ∣ten against truth and friends; one of them by a doctor (so called) of Bremen, in Germany, the other by a priest, of Dantzick, in Poland. They were both full of gross false∣hoods and reproachful slanders. I found it upon me to answer them, and that I might not be over-much interrupt∣ed by other business and company, I went to Kingston upon Thames, where I wrote an answer to each of them,
<PB N="283" REF="037441_0799_100D93A1CA404C50"/>and also to some other scandalous papers which had been printed and scattered about to misrepresent friends.</P>
<P>While I was there I wrote also the following paper, to persuade the magistrates to moderation towards dissenters, and take off their edge to persecution. Because it should have its full service, I directed it—</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all the rulers, magistrates, and law-makers in En∣gland, Scotland, and Ireland, from the highest to the lowest, and to all other magistrates every-where in that which is called Christendom; desiring their health, peace, tranquillity, life, and salvation in Christ Jesus, the Lord of Glory and Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, and is the King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom all power in heaven and in earth is given, and who will reward every man according to his words and works.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that bear the name of Christian magistrates, my desire is that you may all be found in Christ, and not only have the name, but be made partakers of his divine nature; that ye may be not only sayers of the word, but doers of the word, not only professors of Christ, and talkers of Christ, but let Christ rule in your hearts by faith, and be walkers in Christ. For as Christ's great apos∣tle saith, <Q>As every one hath received the Lord Jesus Christ, so let him walk in him; for in him there is peace.</Q> If all that profess Christ did walk in Christ, they would walk in peace, and be in unity; for the apostle exhorted the Christians in his day to keep the unity of the Spirit. which is the bond of peace, yea of Christ the King of kings peace. All Christians who have the scriptures, and are not in this Spirit of Christ, are not in unity one with another, and so have broken this bond of peace, which should knit and unite them together. Likewise all that profess the truth of Christ should live in it; for it is peace∣able, and the gospel is the gospel of peace; which if all Christians lived in, they would be at peace one with an∣other, and in the glorio the glorious fellowship of the gospel. And if all Christians kept in the fear of God, which is the be∣ginning of the pure, heavenly, peaceable, and gentle wis∣dom, which is easy to be intreated (above that wisdom which is earthly, sensual, devilish, and destroying) there
<PB N="284" REF="037441_0800_100D93A4CFD690C0"/>would be no difference and destroying about matters of religion.</P>
<P>I do declare the mighty day of the Lord is come and coming, and the Lord God is come to teach his people himself by his Son (Hebrews i.) who bruises the serpent's head, that false teacher, that led Adam and Eve from God their Teacher. God will teach his people by his Son, the Teacher of Adam and Eve in paradise, before they fell, disobeyed the Lord and forsook him, and followed the serpent; whose head Christ bruiseth, and renews man and woman up again into the image of God which Adam and Eve were in before they fell: glory and honour be to God through Jesus Christ, who hath called us by his Son into his glorious image, to serve and worship him in his Spirit and truth; which holy Spirit and truth the devil is out of, and cannot come into.</P>
<P>I desire all Christian magistrates to take heed of perse∣cuting any, though they disser from you in matters of faith, worship, and religion. For Christ saith, <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harvest;</Q> and he forbad such as would be plucking up tares: the reason was, "Lest they should pluck up the, wheat also;" for Christ said, it should be his angels work to separate the tares from the wheat. Moreover Christ said, they should go into everlasting punishment that did not visit him in prison in his members; then what will become of them that cast him into prison, where he is made manifest in his members! Oh! lay these things to heart! A day of jud ment will come, vengeance and recompense upon eve∣ry one according to their works.</P>
<P>To those disciples, who would have had fire to come down from heaven to consume them that would not re∣ceive him, he turned about, rebuked, and told them, <Q>They did not know what spirit they were of; for he came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore let all magistrates and priests, in that which is called Christendom, consider who have destroyed men and women's lives since the apostles days, because they could not receive the religions, ways, and worships, which they have made and set up; have they known that spirit they have been of? Are they nor all reproved by, and come under the judgment of Christ? Therefore let all persecution be laid aside concerning religion; let love beat the sway, to overcome evil and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mies; let patience over∣sway
<PB N="285" REF="037441_0801_100D93A665476948"/>passion in all, that all may retain the heavenly reason and the pare understanding, that your moderation in true Christianity may be known to all men. For have you not the Turks. Jews, Tartars, Indians, and Atheists eyes upon you? Therefore be in unity, and let not the name of God and Christ be blasphemed amongst them by means of any that bear the name of Christians. So God may be glorified by all and in all through Jesus Christ, who is over all, who calls all to peace, and is blessed for ever.</P>
<P>I would have you to be as noble as the Bereans, and search the scriptures of Christ and the apostles. Where did he or they give any command to imprison, banish, persecute, or put to death any that would not receive or conform to them, or that were contrary-minded to them in religion, or differed from them in matters of worship?</P>
<P>Again I desire all Christian magistrates to search both criptures and chronicles, and see what was the end of all persecutors, and what judgments came upon them. What fell upon Cain, who was the first persecutor for matters of faith and sacrifice? Did not he become a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth? What became of the old world that grieved God, and Noah, a preacher of righteous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss? What became of Sodom that vexed just Lot? What be∣came of Pharaoh that persecuted God's people in Egypt? (though the more he persecuted them the more they grew) What became of Ahab and Jezebel that persecuted the Lord's prophets? And what became of Haman that would have destroyed the Jews? What became of the Jews and Jerusalem that persecuted Christ and the apostles? What was the end of all these? Are they not become vagabonds in the earth, and driven away from their native country? Therefore I beseech you in the love and fear of God, be so noble as to search both scripture and history, and let not your divine understanding be clouded. What will become of the beast and whore spoken of in the Revela∣tions, with their false prophets, that have drunk the blood of the saints, martyrs, and prophets of Jesus? Must they not all go with the devil, who is a murderer, destroyer, an I adversary of mankind, into the lake of sire that burns with brimstone? Ye may be sure that spirit that stirs you up to persecution, let it be in whomsoever it will, is not of Christ, and of his lamb-like nature, who takes away the sins of the world, not the lives of men.</P>
<P>Paul was a persecutor a haler to prison, before he was
<PB N="286" REF="037441_0802_100D93A8CA650A90"/>converted to Christianity, but never after. And therefore are not all in Saul's nature, let them be of what name or profession soever, that are persecutors, and unconverted into Paul's life of Christianity? He said the life that he lived after he was converted, was by faith in the Son of God; and that he lived, yet not he, but <Q>Christ lived in him,</Q> who came to save men's lives, and not to destroy them. This life should be the life of all Christians now, which Paul in his converted state lived in. And the apostle saith, <Q>The law is good, if a man use it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless, for the ungodly and sinners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers of fathers and mo∣thers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, and for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, liars, and perjured persons,</Q> 1 Tim. i. So the law in its place is good against such. Again the apostle says, <Q>The law was added because of transgression,</Q> Gal. iii. 19. Here all magistrates may see what the law in its place is good against, and what it was made for and against, and what evils, the apostle says, it takes hold upon. He does not say, the law should be laid upon men that differed from them in their religion and judgment, nor upon right∣eous men. So you may see in what condition the law is good, and what it was made against; not against righteous men, against whom they have nothing, only because they differ from them in matters of religion; letting manslayers, whoremongers, perjured persons, ungodly, prophane per∣sons, liars, &amp;c. go unpunished; so do not use, nor execute the law lawfully, as the apostle says; <Q>The law is good, if a man use it lawfully.</Q> Therefore it ought to be used lawfully; which law, the apostle says, is for the punish∣ment of evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well, as may be seen, Rom. xiii. So, as the apostle said, <Q>We do not break the law, nor make it void; but we establish the law,</Q> Rom. iii. 31.</P>
<P>This is from him who desires the eternal good and salvation of you all in Christ Jesus, Amen.</P>

After I had finished these services, I returned to Lon∣don, where I staid about a month, labouring amongst friends in the work of the Lord, both in publick meetings for wor∣ship, and in those relating to the outward affairs of the church. Then feeling my spirit drawn to visit friends about Enfield, I went to Waltham Abbey, where I had a very precious meeting, and another at Flamstead Heath. Having spent some time amongst friends thereabouts, and had divers good meetings at Edmonton, Enfield, Winchmore-hill, and other places, I came back to London a little before the yearly meeting, which was in the third month 1681. It was a very precious meeting, in which the glorious presence and power of the Lord was eminently felt and enjoyed.</P>
<P>Some time after it came upon me to write the following epistle:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the quarterly men's and women's meetings that are gathered in the name and power of Jesus:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CHRIST, the second Adam, who is both head and husband of his church, the Redeemer, Purchaser, Saviour, Sanctifier, and Reconciler of his sons and daugh∣ters to God, I say his presence (to wit Christ's) feel among you, to exercise his prophetical office, in opening you with his light, grace, truth, power, and spirit; and to exercise his office, as he is a bishop, to oversee you with his light, grace, power, and spirit, that ye do not go astray from God. As Christ is a shepherd, feel, see, and hear him ex∣ercising that office, who has laid down his life for his sheep, is feeding them in his living pastures of life, and makes them to drink of his living, eternal springs. Let him rule and govern in your hearts, as he is king, that his heavenly and spiritual government all may live under, as true sub∣jects of his righteous, peaceable kingdom, which stands in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, over Sa∣tan and his power, the unclean, unholy ghost, and all un∣righteousness. So all ye subjects to Christ's kingdom of peace, if ye want wisdom, knowledge, life, or salvation, Christ is the treasure; feel him the treasure among you. And every one, as ye have received Christ, walk in him in whom ye have peace; who bruises the head of the serpent, the author of all strife, distraction, and confusion: yea, you have peace with God, and one with another, though the trouble be from the world and the world's spirit. There∣fore,

Whatever ye do, let it be done in the name of Jesus, to the praise of God the Father, keeping in unity in the Holy Spirit of God, which was before the unholy spirit was: which Holy Spirit is your bond of peace, yea, the holy King of Kings and Lord of Lords his peace. And in this holy, pure Spirit is your eternal unity and fellowship; in which Spi∣rit of truth ye serve and worship the God of truth, who is God over all, blessed for ever, Amen. So the Lord guide you all with his Word of patience, Word of life, power, and wisdom, in all your actions, lives, conversations, and meetings to God's glory.

<P>About this time I had occasion to go to several of the judges chambers, upon a suit about tithes. For my wife and I, with several other friends, were sued in Cartmel Wa∣pentake Court in Lancashire, for small tithes, and we had demurred to the jurisdiction of that court. Whereupon the plaintiff prosecuted us in the exchequer court at Westmin∣ster; where they run us up to a writ of rebellion, for not answering the bill upon oath, and got an order of court to the serjeant to take me and my wife into custody. This was a little before the yearly meeting, at which time it was thought they would have taken me up; and according to outward appearance it was likely, and very easy for him to have done it, I lodging at the same places where I used to lodge, and being very publick in meetings. But the Lord's power was over them, and restrained them, so that they did not take me. Yet understanding a warrant was out against me, as soon as the yearly meeting was well over, I took William Mead with me, and went to several of the judges chambers, to let them understand both the state of the case, and the ground and reason of our refusing to pay tithes. The first we went to was judge Gregory, to whom I ten∣dered mine and my wife's answer to the plaintiss's bill; in
<PB N="289" REF="037441_0805_100D93AF6D6EAD20"/>which was set forth, That my wife had lived three-and-forty years at Swarthmore, and in all that time there had been no tithe paid nor demanded: and an old man, who had long been a tithe-gatherer, had made affidavit that he never gathered tithe at Swarthmore Hall in judge Fell's time, nor since. There were many particulars in our answer, but it would not be accepted without an oath. I told the judge, that both tithe and swearing among Christians came from the pope; and it was matter of conscience to us not to pay tithes, nor to swear; for Christ bid his disciples, who had freely received, give freely; and he commanded them, <Q>Not to swear at all.</Q> The judge said. There was tithe paid in England before popery was. I asked him by what law or statute they were paid then? but he was silent. Then I told him, there were eight poor men brought up to London out of the north about two hundred miles, for small tithes; one of them had no family, but himself and his wife, and kept no living creature but a cat. I asked him also, Whe∣ther they could take a man and his wife, and imprison them both for small tithes, and so destroy a family? If they could, I desired to know by what law? He did not answer me; but only said, That was an hard case. When I found there was no help to be had there, we left him, and went to judge Montague's chamber. With him I had a great deal of dis∣course concerning tithes. Whereupon he sent for our ad∣versary's attorney; and when he came, I offered him our answer. He said, If we would pay the charges of the court, and be bound to stand trial, and abide the judgment of the court, we should not have the oath tendered to us. I told him, they had brought those charges upon us, by requiring us to put in our answer upon oath; which they knew before we could not do for conscience-sake; and as we could not pay any tithe, nor swear, so neither should we pay any of their charges. Upon this he would not receive our answer. So we went from thence to judge Atkyns's chamber; and he being busy, we gave our answers and our reasons against tithes and swearing to his clerk; but neither could we find any encouragement from him to expect redress. Where∣fore leaving him, we went to one of the most noted counsel∣lors, and shewed him the state of our case, and our answers: he was very civil to us, and said, <Q>This way of proceeding against us was somewhat like an inquisition.</Q> A few days after, those eight poor friends, that were brought up so far out of the north, appeared before the judges and the Lord
<PB N="290" REF="037441_0806_100D93B1CC533A48"/>was with them, and his power was over the court, so that the friends were not committed to the Fleet. Our cause was put off till the next term (called Michaelmas term) and then it was brought before the four judges again. William Mead told the judges, that I had engaged myself never to meddle with my wife's estate. The judges could hardly believe that any man would do so; whereupon he shewed them the writing under my hand and seal; at which they wondered. Then two of the judges and some of the law∣yers stood up and pleaded for me, that I was not liable to the tithes; but the other two judges and divers lawyers 'pressed earnestly to have me sequestered, alleging that I 'was a publick man. At length they prevailed with one of the other two judges to join with them, and then granted a sequestration against me and my wife together. There∣upon, by advice of counsel, we moved for a limitation, which was granted; and that much defeated our adversary's design in suing out the sequestration; for this limited the plaintiff to take no more than was proved. One of the judges, baron Weston, was very bitter, and broke forth in a great rage against me in the open court: but in a little time after he died.</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting I tarried about a month in London; then went into Sussex to visit friends there, amongst whom I had many large and very precious meet∣ings in divers parts of that county. Yet I spent not much time in Sussex, but returned pretty soon to London, whi∣ther I felt drawings in my spirit; and had very good service for the Lord there, both in publick meetings and amongst friends. When I had tarried sometime in London, I went to Edmonton; and from thence into Buckinghamshire, where I visited friends at several meetings in the upper side of that county; and then went by Henley to Reading, where I tarried several meetings. I went no farther west∣ward at this time than Ore, where I had a very large meet∣ing; after which, striking through the edge of Oxfordshire, I had a large and very precious meeting at Warborough, in which the glory of the Lord shined over all. Many friends came to this meeting out of Berkshire, Buckingham∣shire, and Hampshire. From thence I passed to Ilmore in the Vale of Buckinghamshire, where we had a glorious meet∣ing. The day following I returned to Mary Penington's. From whence I visited the men's and women's monthly meetings at Hungerhill, and some other meetings there∣abouts;
<PB N="291" REF="037441_0807_100D93B38B95E588"/>then passed to Watford, where was a marriage of two friends, at which I was present. A very large meeting we had on that occasion, and the Lord's power was over all. I went from Watford to Longford in Middlesex, visiting friends at Uxbridge in the way. At Longford we had a large meeting, it being on first-day, and the presence of the Lord was preciously felt amongst us; blessed be his name! I passed from Longford to Kingston, visiting friends as I went, at Staines and Sunbury. At Kingston I abode with friends two meetings, wherein we were sweetly refreshed together in the Lord. Passing from thence towards London, I had a very precious meeting at Wandsworth: then crossing over to Hammersmith. I had a good meeting there; which was the larger by reason of a burial, and there being a pretty open∣ress in the people on that occasion, I had a fine opportuni∣ty to open the way of truth amongst them.</P>
<P>After I was come to London, I was moved to write the following paper, concerning that spirit which had led some who professed truth, into strife and division, and to oppose the way and work of the Lord:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that keep your habitation in the truth that is over all, do see that it is the same spirit which leads the backsliders and apostates now from the spiritual fellowship and unity of the church of Christ, that led Adam and Eve from God. This spirit was the same that was in the world, which got into the Jews when they were gone from the Spirit of God; and then turned against God and his pro∣phets, and against Christ and his apostles. That spirit led them to be as bad as Pilate, or worse. The enmity or adversary was got within them against the truth, and those that walked in it, and the Spirit of the Lord; so that they killed and destroyed the Just. This was the spirit of the devil, the destroyer, who sought not only to destroy the truth, but the order of it, and those that walked in it, when true Christianity was planted among the possessors of the light, grace, and truth, the holy gospel faith and Spi∣rit, who enjoyed Christ in their heart. But when some began to err from the Spirit and faith, to hate the light, disobey the gospel, turn the grace of God into wantonness, walk despitefully against the Spirit of grace, turn from the truth, crucify to themselves Christ afresh, and put him to open shame; these were they that let in the spirit of the
<PB N="292" REF="037441_0808_100D93B6C3545350"/>world, who held the form of godliness, but denied the power thereof; and troubled the churches in the apostles days. When the spirit of Satan had got into such, they were more troublesome to the church than the open perse∣cutors without. These got into the assemblies to deceive the hearts of the simple; having the good words and fair speeches, the sheep's clothing. Paul, Peter, John, Jude, and James had much to do with such, to keep them from troubling the church of Christ; for they are out of the light, power, and Spirit; therefore the apostles of Christ exhort∣ed the saints to keep to the Word of life within; to the Anointing: to the grace, truth, and Holy Spirit in their hearts. This foul spirit will profess all the scriptures in words; but by the Spirit of God, which is holy, that spi∣rit is tried, and its fruits. So the apostates went from the power and Spirit of God, and turned against the prophets and martyrs of Jesus; and became the whore, whose cup all nations drank of. The dragon with his tail threw down many of the stars, and would have devoured the woman with his flood; but the woman, the true church, was pre∣served, for the gates of hell cannot prevail against her; and then the dragon made war with her Seed. So the dragon, the whore, beast, and false prophets, all made war against the Lamb and the saints, but the Lamb and the saints will overcome them, and have the victory. And now the ever∣lasting gospel is preached again to all nations, tongues, and people; and many are gathered into the gospel, the power of God, turned to the light, which is the life in Christ, grafted into him, and are come to walk in the order of the new covenant of light and life, in the gospel of peace and salvation. The same spirit that opposed the apostles and the churches in their days, opposes now; yea, it is the same that opposed Christ and disdained him, that disdain∣eth God's servants now. The same that opposed the pro∣phets, and rebelled against Moses, opposes and rebels against God's servants and people now. It is the same dark, blind, disobedient, faithless, wilful, jealous spirit, that perse∣cutes some with the hands, and others with the tongue. It is the same spirit that is now going about sometimes like a roar∣ing lion, sometimes like a twisting serpent to tempt, to de∣ceive, and to devour, in those that have fair speeches and good words, the sheep's clothing, in a form of godliness, un∣der pretence of light and liberty, but deny the power thereof, and inwardly are ravening wolves. If it were possible they
<PB N="293" REF="037441_0809_100D93B856828320"/>would deceive the very elect. But the elect are in the co∣venant of light and life, in the power of God over them, and in Christ, who will grind them to pieces, and slay all his enemies with his spiritual sword, who will not have him to rule over or in them. In Christ all his people have rest and peace, who is their sanctuary over all storms and tempests. In Christ, the sanctuary, no deceiver nor de∣stroyer can come; for he is a place of sweet rest and safe∣ty. Hallelujah! praise the Lord for his sanctuary, Amen.</P>

<P>Sufferings continuing severe upon friends at London, I found my service lay mostly there: wherefore I went but lit∣tle out of town, and not far; being frequent at the most publick meetings, to encourage friends, both by word and example, to stand fast in the testimony to which God had called them. At other times I went from house to house, visiting those friends that had their goods taken away for their testimony to truth. And because the wicked inform∣ers were grown very audacious, by reason they had much countenance and encouragement from some justices, who, trusting wholly to their information, proceeded against friends without hearing them: whereby many were made to suffer, not only contrary to right, but even contrary to law al∣so. I advised with some friends about it; and we drew up a paper, which was delivered to most of the magistrates in and about the city, as followeth:</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS informers have obtained warrants of some justices of peace, who have convicted many of us without hearing us, or once summoning us to appear be∣fore them; by which proceedings many have had their goods seized and taken away, being generally sined ten pounds apiece for an unknown speaker: and some of those persons so fined have not been at the meetings they were fined for; and the speaker notwithstanding hath himself been fined for the same meeting, the same day the others were fined for the unknown speaker. The justices may see the wickedness of these informers, by whose false oaths we have been convicted for an unknown preacher, when the preacher hath been both known and fined. Also in their swearing such persons to have been at such a meeting such a day, when indeed those so sworn against have not
<PB N="294" REF="037441_0810_100D7F9E05D19BD8"/>been at that meeting. By which proceedings several fa∣milies of the king's peaceable subjects are like to be ruined, if a speedy stop be not put thereunto. Therefore we hope and desire that you, the king's justices, for the time to come, when any informers shall come to any of you with an in∣formation against any of us, will summon such as are ac∣cused to appear before you, and hear us and our accusers face to face; that none may suffer for what they are not guilty of. For Pilate the governor heard Christ and his accusers face to face before he condemned him, John xix. The council and chief priests heard Stephen and his ac∣cusers, with the witnesses that were brought against him, face to face, before they condemned him, Acts vii. The Roman captain heard Paul and his accusers face to face. Acts xxiii. Felix the governor heard Paul and Ananias the high-priest, and the elders that accused Paul, face to face, Acts xxiv. And when the high-priests and chief of the Jews accused Paul to Festus, he heard Paul and his accusers, and them that witnessed against him, face to face, Acts xxv. Doth the law of God, or did the Roman law, or doth the law of the land judge any man before he and his accusers, and they that witness against him, be heard face to face?</Q></P>
<P>This somewhat moderated the justices: and after this se∣veral friends, who had been illegally prosecuted and fined, entered their appeals; upon trial whereof they were acquit∣ted, and the informers cast: which was a great discourage∣ment to the informers, and some relief to friends.</P>
<P>A little before the time for choosing new sheriffs for the ci∣ty, those who put up to be chosen desiring our friends to give their voices for them, I wrote a few lines, tending to discover what spirit they were of, and how they stood affect∣ed to true liberty; it was by way of inquiry, thus:</P>
<P><Q>DO any here in London, who stand to be chosen she∣riffs, own that Christ, who was crucified without the gates of Jerusalem, to be the light of the world, that "en∣lightens every man that cometh into the world," who saith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light?</Q> Is any of you against persecuting people for their religion and worship of God in Spirit and truth, as Christ commandeth? For Christ said. <Q>I am not of this world nor my kingdom:</Q> therefore he doth not uphold his spi∣ritual
<PB N="295" REF="037441_0811_100D93BC25C33898"/>worship and pure religion with worldly and carnal weapons. Christ said, "Swear not at all;" and his apostle James saith the same: but will not you force us to swear, and break Christ's and his apostle's commands, in putting oaths to us? Christ saith to his apostles, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give:</Q> Will not you force us to give tithes and maintenance to such teachers as we know God hath not sent? Shall we be free to serve and worship God, and keep his and his Son's commands, if we give our voices freely for you? for we are unwilling to give our voices for such as will imprison and persecute us, and spoil our goods.</Q></P>
<P>But whatever the candidates were, I observed heat and strife in the spirits of the people that were to choose; where∣fore I wrote a few lines to be spread amongst them, di∣rected,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the people who are choosing sheriffs in London:<LB/>
People,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL keep in the gentle and peaceable wisdom of God, which is above that which is earthly, sensual, and devilish; and live in that love of God that is not puffed up, nor is unseemly; which envieth not, but beareth and endureth all things. In this love ye will seek the good and peace of all men, and the hurt of no man. Keep out of all heats, be not hot-headed; but be cool and gentle, that your Christian moderation may appear to all men; for the Lord is at hand, who beholds all men's words, thoughts, and actions, and will reward every one according to their work: what every man soweth, that shall he reap.</P>
<P>I had some inclination to go into the country to a meet∣ing: but hearing there would be a bustle at our meetings, and feeling great disquietness in people's spirits in the city about choosing sheriffs, it was upon me to go to the meeting in Gracechurch-street on first-day. William Penn went with me, and spoke in the meeting. While he was decla∣ring the truth, a constable came in with his great staff, and bid him give over, and come down: but William Penn held on, declaring truth in the power of God. After awhile the constable drew back; and when William Penn had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I stood up and declared to the people <Q>the everlast∣ing
<PB N="296" REF="037441_0812_100D93C02031C688"/>gospel which was preached in the apostles days, and to Abraham; which the church in the apostles days did receive, and came to be heirs of. This gospel, I declared, was sent from heaven by the Holy Ghost in the apostles days, and is so now; and was not of man, neither by man, but by the revelation of the Holy Ghost. And now this gospel is preached again (as John saw, and said it should be) to all nations, tongues, and people; and all people now are to hear Christ the Prophet, in this his gos∣pel of the new covenant. For as Moses said, <Q>Like un∣to me will God raise up a prophet, and him shall ye hear in all things:</Q> so said I, this prophet Christ is come, and all the Jews in Spirit, the true believing Christians in the light, who have the law of God written in their hearts, and put into their minds, are to hear Christ in his gospel, new testament, and new covenant, which is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, who bruises the serpent's head (which is the head of enmity) and makes free from the law of sin and death. I shewed, that all whom Christ quickens and makes alive, he makes to sit together in the heavenly places in himself. So that they do not wander up and down, like the fool's eye in the corners of the earth; nor are their eyes abroad in the world, to sit down in the world's invented seats of religion; but they sit together in him, as the saints did in the apostles days. So Christ was and is their treasure of wisdom, life, knowledge, and sal∣vation.</Q> As I was thus speaking, two constables came in with their great staves, and bid me, <Q>give over speaking and come down.</Q> But I, feeling the power of the Lord with me, spoke on therein, both to the constables, and to the people. To the constables I declared, <Q>That we were a peaceable people, who meet to wait upon God, and wor∣ship 'him in Spirit and in truth; and therefore they needed not to have come with their staves against us, who were met in a peaceable manner, desiring and seeking the good and salvation of all people.</Q> Then turning my speech to the people again, I declared what further was upon me to them. While I was speaking, the constables drew towards the door, and the soldiers stood with their muskets in the yard. When I had done speaking, I kneeled down, and prayed, desiring the Lord to open the eyes and hearts of all people, high and low, that their minds might be turned to God by his Holy Spirit: that he might be glorified in all and over all. After prayer the meeting rose, and friends
<PB N="297" REF="037441_0813_100D93C259FEA1F0"/>passed away, the constables being come in again without the soldiers; and indeed both they and the soldiers carried them∣selves civilly. William Penn and I went into a room hard by, as we used to do, and many friends went with us; and left the constables should think we would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, a friend went down and told them, if they would have any thing with us, they might come where we were, if they pleased. One of them came to us soon after, but without his staff; which he chose to do, that he might not be observed; for he said, <Q>The people told him, he busied himself more than he needed.</Q> We desired to see his warrant; and we there∣in found the informer was one Hilton, a north country man, reputed a Papist. The constable was asked, Whe∣ther he would arrest us by his warrant on that day, it being first-day, which in their law was called the Lord's day? He said, 'He thought he could not.' He told us also, <Q>He had charged the informer to come along with him to the meeting, but he had run away from him.</Q> We shewed the constable, that both he and we were clear; yet to free him from all fear of danger, we were free to go to the alder∣man that granted the warrant. A friend present said, He would go with the constable to speak with the alderman; which they did, and came presently back again, the alder∣man being gone from home. We seeing the constable in a strait, and finding him a tender man, bid him set an hour to come to us again, or send for us, and we would come to him. So he appointed the fifth hour in the afternoon, but neither came nor sent for us; and a friend meeting him af∣terwards in the evening, the constable told him, <Q>He thought it would come to nothing, and therefore did not look after us.</Q> So the Lord's power was over all; to him be the glory!</P>
<P>The fourth-day following, it was upon me to go to Grace∣church-street meeting again: for I had heard they would come to break up the meeting that day. The neighbours, it seems, were informed so, a justice had granted a warrant for that purpose, and the constable told a friend that Hilton the informer had been with him about it. The constable would have had the informer to have gone with him to the meeting, but he would not; and would have the constable go without him: whether that put the constable by I know not; but he did not come. I was in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the power of God, and was moved in it to go to the meet∣ing; and the Lord's power did chain all down. Though
<PB N="298" REF="037441_0814_100D93C4166448D8"/>they threatened to bring the red coats, none of them came, nor was there any disturbance; but a glorious, powerful meeting it was, and very peaceable: glory, honour, and praises be to the Lord over all for ever, Amen!</P>
<P>During the time I abode at London, as I had leisure be∣tween meetings, and from other publick services, I wrote divers books and papers; some of which were printed, and others spread about in manuscript. Of these, one was di∣rected, <Q>To the bishops and others, that stirred up persecu∣tion; to shew them from the holy scriptures, that they did not walk therein according to the royal law, <Q>To love their neighbour as themselves, and to do to others as they would be done unto.</Q> An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her was, 'To all the several sorts of professed Christians, as well Protestants as Papists, whose religion and worship stands in outward ob∣servances and ceremonies; pressing them, from those words of the apostle Paul to the Galatians, chap. v. ver. 2, 3, 4. <Q>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to the whole law. Christ is become of no effect unto you, who∣soever of you are justified by the law: ye are fallen from grace,</Q> to consider, whether they, being gone back into legal observations and shadowy ceremonies (in upholding tithes, offerings, first-fruits, priests garments, outward al∣tars, temples, lamps, lights, &amp;c. and in observing days, months, times, years, with many other things commanded by the law) were not gone into the same state that the Ga∣latians were running into; and so were fallen from grace, and become debtors to the whole law.</Q> Another was, 'To direct and turn all people to the Spirit of God, that they might thereby receive a right understanding, and be able to distinguish between right and wrong, truth and er∣ror; that under pretence of punishing evil-doers, they might not themselves do evil in persecuting the righteous. Which is here inserted:</P>
<P>THE Spirit of God, which he hath poured upon all, giveth an understanding to all that are led by it; and to those who do not quench the motions of it, it giveth knowledge and understanding to distinguish good from evil, light from darkness, Christ from Antichrist, the old testament or covenant from the new, the old way from the new and living way; the sheep and lambs from the goats
<PB N="299" REF="037441_0815_100D93C66FDB82B8"/>and wolves; the worship of God, which Christ set up above sixteen hundred years ago, from the dragon's and beast's worship; and all those that worship the works of men's hands, and the will-worshippers, from them that worship God in his Spirit and in his truth, in which God's people worship him; which worship is over all false wor∣ships and worshippers. Those who believe in the light, which is the life in Christ, become the children of light, and are the lambs of Jesus. These lambs follow the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world; they will not follow the hirelings, nor the strangers to be led into strange ways, doctrines, religions, and churches: for the lambs of Christ follow Christ the Lamb of God, and know his heavenly voice. They know also, that those who are without Christ are dogs and wolves, adulterers, idolaters, liars, and unbelievers, who would devour the lambs: but these are in the hand of the Lord, which is his power, that is over all; such do good in his power unto all; for they have the mind of Christ, who would have all come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. Those that do good to all, do hurt to none: for that spirit, that doth hurt to any, is not of God; but that Spirit, which doth good to all, and especially to the household of faith, is of God. Christ came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them: it is the devil that is the destroyer of men's lives abour religion, who corrupts men and women, makes them deaf and blind to the things of God, and to halt out of, God's way. Those that obey the evil one, and forsake the Lord, such the destroyer doth destroy: but Christ de∣stroys that destroyer, and in Christ all have life.</P>

<P>I wrote also concerning meditation, delight, exercise, and study; shewing from the scriptures of truth what true Chris∣tians ought to meditate upon, exercise their minds and take delight in, and what they shoud study to do. For in these things not prophane and loose people only, but even great professors of religion, are very much mistaken; taking de∣light in earthly, sading, perishing things; whereas they ought to meditate on heavenly things, delight in the law of God after the inw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d man, and exercise themselves to have always a <Q>conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce towards God and to∣wards men,</Q> as the apostle Paul did.</P>

<PB N="300" REF="037441_0816_100D93C8DE041CD0"/>not only in the city, but in most parts of the nation, I drew up a paper to be presented to the king; setting forth our grievances, and desiring redress from him in those particular cases which I understood were in his power. But not hav∣ing relief from him, it came upon me to write an epistle to friends, to encourage them in their sufferings, that they might bear with patience the many exercises brought upon them, both by magistrates and false brethren and apostates; whose wicked books and filthy slanders grieved the upright-hearted. This epistle I wrote at Dalston, whither I went to visit an ancient friend that lay sick.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>FRIENDS and brethren in Christ Jesus, whom the Lord hath called and gathered into himself, in him abide; for without him ye can do nothing, and through him ye can do all things. He is your strength and sup∣port in all your trials, temptations, imprisonments, and sufferings, who for Christ's sake are accounted as sheep for the slaughter: in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Christ who hath loved us. There∣fore, friends, though ye suffer by the outward powers, ye know that the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, suffered by the unconverted. And though ye suffer by false bre∣thren and apostates for a time, and by their filthy books and tongues, whose tongues indeed are become no slander, let them speak, write, or print what they will: for the sober people even of the world hardly regard it. It is well they have manifested themselves to the world, that their folly may proceed no farther; though to the utmost of their power they have shewed their wicked intent to stir up the magistrates, professors, and prophane against us, and to speak evil of the way of truth. God's judgments will overtake them, as sure as they have come upon those that are gone before them. Let their pretence be ever so high, mark their end; for they will fall like untimely figs, and wither like the grass on the top of the house. Though they may seem to flourish, and make a boast and a noise for a time, yet the Seed is on the head of such, which will grind them to powder; which seed bruiseth the serpent's head. Therefore in this Seed. Christ, who is your sanctu∣ary, rest, peace, and quiet habitation, who is the First and the Last, and over all, in him walk; for the Lord taketh pleasure in his faithful people, that serve and worship him. Therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the saints be joyful in glory; and the God
<PB N="301" REF="037441_0817_100D93CADF5F43E8"/>of Peace, the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Jesus Christ, after that ye have suffer∣ed awhile, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, and set∣tle you. Cast all your care upon the Lord, for he careth for you. And dearly beloved, think it not strange con∣cerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing had happened to you; for it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing; and rejoice, inasmuch as ye are made par∣takers of Christ's sufferings. Wherefore let them that suf∣fer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator: for unto you is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake. So it is given, or is a gift from Christ to suffer for his name; and therefore rejoice, inasmuch as ye are made partakers of Christ's sufferings. If ye be reproached or evil-spoken of for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resreth upon you: on their part he is evil-spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. There∣fore if any suffer as Christians, let them not be ashamed, but glorify God on this behalf. Though now for a season ye are in sufferings, trials, and temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than that of gold which perishes, though it be tried with fire, may be found unto praise, honour, and glory, who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation. Therefore mind your keeper, where-ever ye are, or what sufferings soever ye be in; and mind the example of the apostle, how he suffered trouble as an evil-doer, unto bonds. But the Word of God is not bound, which is everlasting and en∣dures for ever: and they who are in that which is not everlasting, and doth not endure for ever, cannot bind the Word. The apostle said, <Q>I endure all things for the elect's sake; that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory (mark, with eternal glory.) And if we suffer with Christ, we shall reign with Christ, who abide faithful.</Q> Therefore strive not about words to no profit; but shun prophane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness; that ye may be vessels of honour, sanctified and meet for Christ your master's use, and prepared unto every good work. Fol∣low after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. Fight the good fight of faith with your hea∣venly
<PB N="302" REF="037441_0818_100D93CD08CDB150"/>weapons; which faith is victory (or gives victory) by which ye lay hold on eternal life, and have access unto God, <Q>who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them, who by patient continuing in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eter∣nal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil; but glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good.</Q> Christ said to his disciples, <Q>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</Q> And, <Q>If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</Q> And John in his general epis∣tle to the church saith, <Q>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.</Q> And Christ in his prayer to his Father saith of his followers, <Q>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world; and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</Q> Therefore all ye that know God and Jesus Christ (whom to know is eternal life) and are partakers of his glo∣ry, keep the testimony of Jesus, and be valiant for his truth upon earth, that ye may be all settled upon Christ, the rock and foundation.</P>

<P>I made but little stay at Dalston, but return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to London, where I continued most part of the winter; labouring in the service of truth amongst friends: save that I was a little while at Kingston, in the tenth month of this year, where I wrote a book, setting forth <Q>The state of the birth temporal, and the birth spiritual: and the duty and state of a child, youth, young men, aged men and fathers in the truth,</Q> &amp;c. But I staid not long at Kingston neither; for the heat of persecution still continuing, I felt my service to be most at London, where our meetings were for the most part dis∣turbed and broken up, or friends were forced to meet with∣out doors, being kept out of their meeting-houses by the
<PB N="303" REF="037441_0819_100D93D043CCEA68"/>officers. Yet sometimes, beyond expectation, we got a quiet and peaceable meeting in the houses. One time I was minded to have gone a mile or two out of town, to visit a friend that was not well: but hearing that the king had sent to the mayor to put the laws in execution against dissenters, and that the magistrates thereupon intended to nail up the meeting-house doors, I had not freedom to go out of town, but was moved to go to the meeting at Grace∣church-street; and, notwithstanding all their threats, a great meeting it was, and very quiet; and the glory of the Lord shone over all.</P>
<P>The same week I went to the meeting at the Peel in John's-street, and the sessions were holden the same day at Hicks's-hall. I went in the morning; and William Mead being to appear at the sessions for not going to the steeple-house worship, came once or twice from Hicks's-hall to me at the Peel; which some ill-minded people observing, went and informed the justices at the bench, that he was gone to a meeting at the Peel. Whereupon they sent a messenger to see if there was a meeting; but this being in the forenoon, there was no meeting, so the messenger went back and told them. Then others informed the justices that there would be a meeting there in the afternoon: whereupon they sent for the chief constable, and asked him, <Q>Why he suffered a meeting to be at the Peel, so nigh him?</Q> He told them, 'He did not know of any meeting there.' They asked him, 'How he could but know it, and live so nigh it?' He said, <Q>He was never there in his life, and did not know there was a meeting there.</Q> They would have persuaded him that he must needs know of it; but he standing steadfast in the de∣nial of it, they said, <Q>They should take order to have it looked after in the afternoon.</Q> But a multitude of busi∣ness coming before them at the sessions, when dinner-time came, they hastened to their dinner, without giving order; and when they came to the bench again after dinner, the Lord put it out of their minds, so the meeting was quiet, beginning and ending in peace; and a blessed meeting we had, the Lord's presence being preciously amongst us. Many friends had a concern upon their minds, when they saw me come into the meeting, lest I should have been ta∣ken; but I was freely given up to suffer, if it was the Lord's will, before I went, and had nothing in my mind concerning it but the Lord's glory. I do believe that the Lord put it out of their minds, that they should not send to
<PB N="304" REF="037441_0820_100D93D1D44623C8"/>break up our meeting that day. Yet the first-day after, three or four justices (as I heard) came to the Peel, and put friends out of their meeting-house, and kept them out: and inquired for William Mead, but he was not there.</P>
<P>That day I was moved to go to Gracechurch-street meet∣ing; and it was expected that the officers would come to break up the meeting, or keep friends out; and many hundreds of people came to see what would be done to us. But the officers came not; so we were in peace and quietness; and many of the people that came to look on, staid all the time; and a glorious, precious meeting we had, for the Lord's presence was plentifully amongst us, and his power came over all; glory to his name for ever, who is over all!</P>
<P>I had seen the mayor's printed speech for putting the laws in execution against dissenters: and it was much in my mind that we should draw up a paper to send to the mayor and aldermen, to clear ourselves from being such as those laws were made against; and to set forth our peaceable behaviour both towards the king and the government. Accordingly a paper was drawn up, signed, and delivered to the mayor; and copies thereof delivered to the aldermen, and the bishop of London, who generally took it kindly, and were civil to the friends that delivered it.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write the few lines fol∣lowing to friends:</P>

<P>Not long after, I received an account by letter, from some friends that were prisoners at Denbigh in Wales, that many friends there were under great sufferings for the testimony of a good conscience. In the tender sense whereof I was moved in the love of God to visit them with a few lines, as a word of consolation to them in their sufferings; and of exhortation, to stand fast in the testimony committed to them, after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR suffering lambs for the name and command of Jesus! be valiant for his truth, and faithful, and ye will feel the presence of Christ with you. Look at him who suffered for you, hath bought you, and will feed you, who saith, 'Be of good comfort, I have overcome the world:' who destroys the devil and his works, and bruises the serpent's head. I say, look at Christ your sanctuary, in whom ye have rest and peace. To you it is given not only to believe, but to suffer for his name's sake. They that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution by the ungodly professors of Christ Jesus who live out of him. Therefore be valiant for God's truth upon the earth, and look above that spirit that makes you suffer, up to Christ, who was before it was, and will be when it is gone. Consider all the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, who suffered and were persecuted; but they were never persecuted as true men, but as deceivers, and yet true. Christ is the same to-day as yesterday, a rock and foundation for your age and generation, for you to build upon. I have written concerning you (after I heard your letter) to friends in Cheshire to visit you, under∣standing that you belong to their quarterly meeting: I desire some friends of your county would go, and lay your suffering condition before the monthly or quarterly meeting in Cheshire. I have written likewise to Richard Davis, that some of that side may go and visit you, and

<P>Because the magistrates were many of them unwilling to have fines laid upon meeting-houses, they kept friends out in many places, setting officers and guards of soldiers at the doors and passages; yet sometimes friends were fined for speaking or praying, though it were abroad. One first-day it was upon me to go to Devonshire-house meeting in the afternoon; and because I had heard friends were kept out there that morning (as they were that day at most meetings about the city) I went somewhat the sooner, and got into the yard, before the soldiers came to guard the passages: but the constables were got there before me, and stood in the door-way with their staves. I asked them to let me go in: they said, <Q>They could not, nor durst not; for they were commanded the contrary, and were sorry for it.</Q> I told them, I would not press upon them; so I stood by, and they were very civil. I stood till I was weary; then one gave me a stool to sit down on: and after awhile the power of the Lord began to spring up among friends, and one began to speak. The constables soon forbad him, and said, he should not speak; and he not stopping, they began to be wroth. But I gently laid my hand upon one of the constables, and wished him to let him alone. The consta∣ble did so, and was quiet; and the man did not speak long. After he had done, I was moved to stand up and speak: and in my declaration said, <Q>They need not come against us with swords and staves; for we were a peaceable people, and had nothing in our hearts but good-will to the king and magistrates, and to all people upon the earth. We did not <Q>meet under pretence of religion to plot and contrive against the government, or to raise in∣surrections</Q> but to worship God in Spirit and in truth. We had Christ to be our Bishop, Priest, and Shepherd, to feed us and oversee us, and he ruled in our hearts; so we could all sit in silence, enjoying our teacher. So to Christ, their Bishop and Shepherd, I recommended them all.</Q> I sat down, and after awhile was moved to pray, and the power of the Lord was over all; and the people, with the constables and soldiers, put off their hats. When
<PB N="307" REF="037441_0823_100D93D74E7FD678"/>the meeting was done, and friends began to pass away, the constable put off his hat, and desired the Lord to bless us: for the power of the Lord was over him and the people.</P>
<P>After this I went up and down, visiting friends at their houses, who had their goods taken from them for worship∣ping God. We took an account of what had been taken from them: and some friends met together about it, and drew up the case of the sufferings of our friends in writing, and gave it to the justices at their petty sessions. Where∣upon they made an order, <Q>That the officers should not sell the goods of friends which they had in their hands, but keep them till the next sessions;</Q> which gave some dis∣couragement to the informers, and put a little stop to their proceedings.</P>
<P>The next first-day it was upon me to go to the meeting at the Savoy; and by that time it was gathered, the beadle came in; and after him the wild people, like a sea, but the Lord's power chained them all. The Spirit of the Lord went through and over all, and they were quiet, and we had a glorious, peaceable meeting; blessed be the Lord for his unspeakable goodness! This was in the twelfth month 1682.</P>
<P>In the first month 1683 I went to Kingston upon Thames. As I went to the meeting, I met the chief con∣stable who had been at the meeting-place, and had set watchmen to keep us out; yet he was pretty civil, and the watchmen let friends have a couple of forms out, to sit upon in the highway: so friends met together there, and a very precious meeting we had; for the refreshing presence of the Lord was with us, in which we parted in peace.</P>
<P>Having visited and encouraged friends there, I returned to London, and went to the meeting at Bull and Mouth, where the constables with their watchmen kept a guard, to keep friends out of the house. So we met in the street; and when any friend spoke, the officers and watchmen made a great bustle to pull him down, and take him into custody. After some other friends had spoken, it was upon me to speak. I said, <Q>Heaven is God's throne, and earth is his footstool: and will ye not let us stand upon God's foot∣stool to worship and serve the living God?</Q> While I spoke, they were quiet: and after I had cleared myself, we broke up our meeting in peace. This was on the sixth day of the week.</P>
<P>On the first-day following I was moved to go to the
<PB N="308" REF="037441_0824_100D93DB33624048"/>meeting at Gracechurch-street. When I came there, I found a guard set at the entrance in Lombard-street, and another at the gate in Gracechurch-street, to keep friends out of the meeting-place; so we were fain to meet in the street. After some time I got a chair, stood up in it, and spoke largely to the people, <Q>Opening the principles of truth to them, and declaring many weighty truths con∣cerning magistracy, and the Lord's prayer.</Q> There was, besides friends, a great multitude of people, and all was very quiet; for the Lord's power was over all, and in his time we broke up our meeting, and departed in peace.</P>
<P>Next day I went to Guildford in Surry; and having vi∣sited friends there, passed to Worminghurst in Sussex, where I had a very blessed meeting among friends, free from dis∣turbance. While I was there, James Claypole of London (who with his wife was there also) was suddenly taken very ill with so violent a fit of the stone, that he could neither stand nor lie; but through the extremity of pain cried out like a woman in travail. When I heard it, I was much exercised in spirit for him, and went to him. After I had spoken a few words to him, to turn his mind inward, I was moved to lay my hand upon him, and prayed the Lord to rebuke his infirmity. As I laid my hand on him, the Lord's power went through him; and by saith in that power he had speedy ease, so that he quickly fell into a sleep. When he awaked, the stone came from him like dirt; and he was so well, that the next day he rode with me five-and-twenty miles in a coach, though he used formerly (as he said) to lie sometimes two weeks, sometimes a month, with one of those fits of the stone. But the Lord was intreated for him, and by his power soon gave him ease at this time: blessed and praised be his holy name therefore!</P>
<P>After I had had some meetings in Sussex and Surry, and visited friends thereaway, I returned to London by Kings∣ton, where I had a meeting on the first day of the second month, being first-day. We were kept out of the meeting∣house by a constable and watchmen, so were fain to meet in the highway. But it being the monthly meeting day, and many people being there, the meeting was pretty large, and very quiet; and the Lord's blessed presence was amongst us; blessed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>Being come to London, I went to the meeting at Wheel∣er-street near Spitalsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lds, which that day proved very large, and a gloricus, blessed meeting it was: for the Lord's power
<PB N="309" REF="037441_0825_100D93DEE87A9450"/>and truth was over all, and many deep and weighty things were opened to the people to their great satisfaction.</P>
<P>I tarried in and near London, visiting meetings, and la∣bouring in the service of the gospel, till the yearly meeting came on, which began the 28th of the third month. It was a time of great sufferings; and much concerned I was, lest friends, that came up out of the country on the church's ser∣vice, should be taken and imprisoned at London. But the Lord was with us, his power preserved us; and gave us a sweet and blessed opportunity to wait upon him, and be refreshed together in him, and to perform those services for his truth and people, for which we met. As it was a time of great persecution, and we understood that in most counties friends were under great sufferings either by impri∣sonments or spoiling of goods, or both, a concern was weigh∣tily upon me, lest any friends, especially traders and dealers in the world, should hazard the losing of other men's goods or estates through their sufferings. Wherefore, as the thing opened in me, I drew an epistle of caution to friends in that case, which I communicated to the yearly meeting; and from thence it was sent among friends throughout the na∣tion; a copy of which here followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO is your only sanctuary in this day of storm andpersecution, spoiling of goods and imprisonments! Let every one's eye be unto him, who has all power in heaven and earth given unto him; so that none can touch an hair of your head, nor you, nor any thing ye have, ex∣cept it be permitted or suffered in this day to try his peo∣ple, whether their minds be with the Lord or in outward things. Dear friends, take care that all your offerings be free, and of your own, that has cost you something; so that ye may not offer of that which is another man's, or that which ye are intrusted withal (and not your own) or fatherless or widows estates; but all such things settle and establish in their places. You may remember many years ago, in a time of great persecution, divers friends, who were traders, shop-keepers, and others, had the concerns of widows and fatherless, and other people's estates in their hands. And when a great suffering, persecution, and spoiling of goods came upon friends, especial care was taken that all might offer up to the Lord in their sufferings what was really their own, and not any other people's es∣tates
<PB N="310" REF="037441_0826_100D93E091EFACC0"/>or goods which they had in their hands; and that they might not offer up another body's, but that which they had bought and paid for, or were able to pay for. After∣wards several letters came out of the country to the meet∣ing at London, from friends that had goods of the shop∣keepers at London upon credit, which they had not paid for; who wrote to their creditors, intreating them to take their goods again. And some friends came to London themselves, and treated with their creditors, letting them understand <Q>they lay liable to have all they had taken from them;</Q> and told them, <Q>they would not have any man to suffer by them; neither would they by suffering offer up any thing but what was really their own, or what they were able to pay for.</Q> Upon which several took their goods again. This wrought a very good favour in the hearts of many people, when they saw such a right∣eous, just, and honest principle in friends, that would not make any suffer for their testimony; but what they did suffer for the testimony of Jesus should be really and truly their own, not other people's. In this they owed nothing to any but love. So in this every man and wo∣man stands in the free offering, a free people, whether it be spiritual or temporal which is their own; and in that they wrong no man, neither inwardly nor outwardly. Or∣nan said unto David, <Q>I give thee the threshing-floor, &amp;c. and the oxen for burnt-offerings: and the threshing-instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering, I give it all.</Q> But king David said unto Ornan, <Q>nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost,</Q> 1 Chron. xxi. 22, &amp;c. So it should be his own, and so should it be every man's that offers. You may see here, that David would not accept of another man's gift for an offering to the Lord; he would not offer up that which cost him nothing, but what should be really his own, Psal. cxii. 5. <Q>A good man— will guide his affairs with discretionf.</Q></P>
<P>Let this be read in your monthly and quarterly men's and women's meetings.</P>

Some time after the yearly meeting I went to Kingston upon Thames to visit friends; and while I was there, it came upon me to write the following epistle to friends in general, as a salutation of love, and to stir up the pure mind in them.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO are turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, who are believers in the light, which is the life in Christ, and are become children of the light and of the day, grafted into Christ, the se∣cond Adam, the Lord from heaven, and are gathered in the name of Jesus, in whom ye have salvation, and not in any other name under the whole heaven. For Christ Je∣sus saith, <Q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</Q> Matth. xviii. 20. So you being gathered in the name of Jesus, he is in the midst of you, a Saviour, a Mediator, a Pro∣phet, a Shepherd, a Bishop, a Leader, a Counsellor, the Captain of your Salvation, who bruises the Serpent's head, and destroys the devil and his works. Therefore, bre∣thren in Christ Jesus, exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For you are made partakers of Christ, if ye hold fast the beginning of your confidence steadfast to the end, Hebr. iii. 14. Therefore hear Christ's voice; for he is in the midst of you a teacher. Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in depart∣ing from the living God, as there is in too many in this day of provocation and temptation. While it is to-day hear his voice, and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works. Let us hold fast the pro∣fession of our faith without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised, and hath called you) not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is: mark, "as the manner of some is," that did and do for∣sake the assembling of themselves together; but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day of light appearing. For if we sin wilfully after we have re∣ceived the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judg∣ment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adver∣saries, Hebr. x. Therefore it is good not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but exhort one another
<PB N="312" REF="037441_0828_100D9493416479D0"/>daily; for Christ is in the midst of his people a teacher and a prophet, who saith, <Q>Learn of me, the way, the truth, and the life.</Q> We being many are one body in Christ, gathered in his name, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given us, whether they be prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; and let those that minister wait on their ministry; those that be teachers on their teaching; and he that exhorteth on ex∣hortation; he that gives, let him do it with simplicity; and he that ruleth, with diligence; and he that sheweth mercy is to do it with cheerfulness. Abhor that which evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one towards another, with brotherly love, in honour pre∣ferring one another. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribu∣lations, <Q>be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good;</Q> and, if it be possible, as much as lieth in you, "live peaceably with all men;" Rom. xii. This is and was the practice of the church of Christ. And now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believ∣ing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and are able also to admonish one another, Rom. xv. 13, 14. Here the church of Christ, in which he was in the midst, a teacher and the head of the church, were and are able through him to admonish one another. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are also called into one body, to wit, of Christ. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. teaching and admonishing one another, &amp;c. Col. iii. <Q>Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him;</Q> and above all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. The apostle saith to Timothy, <Q>Be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his pri∣soner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gos∣pel, according to the power of God, who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</Q> 2 Tim. i. 8, 9. It concerns every one not to be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, who hath called them by his grace; and not to be ashamed of any of Christ's pri∣soners,
<PB N="313" REF="037441_0829_100D7FA8D3FA6140"/>and afflicted ones for Christ's and his gospel's sake, who abolishes death, and brings life and immortality to light through his gospel; you that believe in the light, know it. Peter saith in his general epistle to the church of Christ, "As every man," mark every man, <Q>hath re∣ceived the gift, so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God,</Q> so not of men. <Q>If any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God gives,</Q> so not of the ability of men's arts and scien∣ces, <Q>that God in all things may be glorified through Je∣sus Christ,</Q> &amp;c. For these gifts and grace come from Je∣sus into the hearts of the members of his church, whom he is in the midst of. And if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God, &amp;c. Every true Christian hath the presence of Christ, who hath all power in heaven and in earth given him, to sup∣port "them with his power, light, and life. Christ saith "to his believers, <Q>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in the synagogues, and you shall be brought before governors and kings for my name's sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in the same hour what ye shall speak: for it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord; it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord; for if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, what will they do to his servant? Fear not them which kill the bo∣dy, but are not able to kill the soul, &amp;c. A sparrow shall not fall to the ground without your heavenly Father, &amp;c. The hairs of your head are all numbered, ye are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. And whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be asham∣ed,</Q> &amp;c. Matth. x. Again Christ saith, <Q>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulte∣rous
<PB N="314" REF="037441_0830_100D93DCCDA30B08"/>and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with his holy angels,</Q> Mark viii. 38. And Christ saith to his disciples, <Q>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me; he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall re∣ceive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righte∣ous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward. Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward,</Q> Matth. x. 40, 41, 42. Here ye may see how Christ encourages his disciples, and them that receive them. And John saith, <Q>Among the chief rulers of the Jews many believed in Christ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue,</Q> John xii. 42. Too many such believers are now-a-days, who dare not confess Christ, lest they should lose the favour of men. But Christ en∣courages the faithful disciples, and told them, they would put them out of their synagogues; yea, that the time should come, that whosoever killed them would think they did God service. "These things," said he, <Q>will they do unto you, because they have not known the Fa∣ther, nor me. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them,</Q> John xvi. 2, 3, 4. Here ye may see what Christ told his Disciples should come to pass to them. And Saul, before he was converted, did compel the Chris∣tians to blaspheme, and make havock of the Church of Christ, Acts viii. and chap. 22 and 26. Did not the beast in the Revelations compel both small and great to worship him and his image? And did not all worship it, but those who had their names written in the Lamb's book of life? Did not Nebuchadnezzar set up an image of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad? And did not he cause a herald to cry aloud, <Q>It is commanded that all people, and nations, and languages fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar hath set up; and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of the siery furnace?</Q> And were not Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego cast into the furnace? Dan. iii. But God delivered them. Therefore it is good to be faithful to God and his worship in spirit
<PB N="315" REF="037441_0831_100D93E58F2A04E0"/>and truth. The Jews agreed, that if any man should confess Christ he should be put out of their synagogue, John ix. 22. So it was for Christ's sake they were ex∣communicated out of their synagogues. But, as it is writ∣ten, <Q>Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone, and a rock of offence; and whoso believes on him shall not be asha∣med.</Q> So Christ is a stumbling-stone and a rock of of∣fence to all the unbelievers in the light, which is the life in Christ, whether they be Jews, Christians, or Gentiles. The Jews did believe Christ was to come, from the scrip∣tures, and the Christians believe he is come, by the scrip∣tures, but do not believe in the light as Christ commands, and so do not become children of the light. Therefore ye that are believers in the light, and are become the chil∣dren of light, walk in Christ, your way, life, and salvation.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY love is to you all in the holy seed that reigns over all. And my desire is that every one, both male and female, may feel the seed Christ in you, which is heir of the promise of life eternal, that ye may all grow up in Christ Jesus, your head, and be built upon him the rock and foundation that God hath laid, which stands sure over all rocks and foundations in the world. That ye may eat and drink of this spiritual rock, the spiritual water and food; so that ye may truly and inwardly say, your rock and foundation, your bread and water of life is from hea∣ven, and your bread and water is sure; also that ye know his voice that feeds, and leads you into the pastures of life, which are always fresh and green. In this your affections are set on things above, seeking that which comes down from above more than that which is from below, where Christ sits at the right hand of God, making intercession for you; who is your mediator, making peace betwixt God and you; and your heavenly bishop to oversee you, that ye keep in his light, life, and power, and do not go astray from his heavenly fold and pasture, that he your
<PB N="316" REF="037441_0832_100D93E743C71638"/>shepherd may feed you therein. He is your prophet, to open to you the fulfilling of the promises and prophecies, himself being the substance; that ye may live in him, and he in you, yea, and reign in your hearts; there to exercise his offices, his prophetical, priestly, and kingly office, who is heavenly and spiritual. That ye may know the three that bear witness in the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, which is the Life of Christ, which cleans∣eth from all sin; the Water that washes and refreshes you, the Spirit that baptizes, circumcises, and leads you into all truth; that ye may come all to drink into one Spirit, and keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of the heavenly peace. So being led by the Spirit of God, ye are his sons and daughters, and by his Spirit will come to know the three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. These are the three wit∣nesses that are in heaven, that bear record of all things; for he is God in the heaven, and God in the earth. There∣fore I desire that ye may all feel his love shed in your hearts, and in it live (above the love of the world, which is enmity) and in that you will keep in the excellent way, For love edifies the body of Christ, builds his church up, and keeps out of the enmity; for it is above it, and brings and keeps all in true humanity, and in the true divinity; and to be courteous, kind, and tender one towards an∣other. And shew forth the nature of Christ, and true christianity, in all your lives and conversations, that the blessings of the Lord may rest upon you, as ye all live in the seed of the gospel, the seed of the kingdom of God, in which all nations are blessed. In that ye will all have a care of God's glory. There is the hill or mountain where the light shines to the answering the witness of God in all, and the salt that is a good favour to the witness of God in the hearts of all; which favour and salt being kept in, it doth not come under the feet of men. So my love to you all in Christ Jesus, whom God hath given to be a sanctuary for all his people, who is from above, and not of this world, in whom ye have life, peace, and salva∣tion. In him God Almighty keep and preserve you all to his glory, Amen. As you live in the peaceable truth of God, it keeps you under and within his protection; but they that make profession of the scriptures of truth, and yet live out of the truth, in the spirit of strife, un∣quietness and discontent, in a contriving, plotting, rave∣nous,
<PB N="317" REF="037441_0833_100D93EA236FAF90"/>destroying spirit, which is of the devil, and not of God, that spirit is judged out of the truth, and to be of him in whom there is no truth, whose portion is in the lake, and in the fire that burns.</P>

<P>Having visited friends at and about Kingston I returned to London; for it being a suffering time with friends there, I had not freedom to be long from the city. I went to the meeting at the Peel; which but a little before the justices and constables had broken up, and had carried themselves very roughly; but that day the meeting was in the house, and quiet, and a glorious meeting it was, blessed be the Lord.</P>
<P>On first-day following I went to the meeting at Grace-church-street, where I found three constables in the meeting∣house, who kept friends out; so we met in the court. After I had been some time in the meeting, I stood up, and spoke to the people, and continued speaking a pretty while. Then one of the constables came, took hold of my hand, and said, 'I must come down.' I desired him to be patient, and went on speaking to the people; but after a little time he plucked me down, and had me into the meeting-house. I asked them, if they were not weary of this work? One of them said, 'Indeed they were.' They let me go into the widow Foster's house, which joined to the meeting-house, where I staid, being hot. When the meeting was ended, for one prayed after I was taken away, the constables asked some friends, <Q>Which of them would pass their words that I should appear, if they should be questioned about me?</Q> But the friends telling them, <Q>They need not require that, for I was a man well known in the city to be one that would neither fly nor shrink;</Q> they came not to me, but went their way, and I heard no further of it. The same week I was at the meeting at the Savoy, which used to be kept out and disturbed; but that day it was within doors and peaceable, and a precious meeting it was. The first-day after it was upon me to go to the meeting at Westmin∣ster, where used to be great disturbances: but there also the meeting was within doors that day, and was very large. The Lord's power was over all, and kept all quiet and still; for though many loose spirits were there, yet they were
<PB N="318" REF="037441_0834_100D93ECB7E51118"/>bound down by the power and Spirit of the Lord, that they could not get up to make disturbance.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write the following epistle:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO have received the peaceable truth, let the fruits of its peaceableness, and of your quiet spirit appear in all your meetings and in all your words and actions; for he that inhabits eternity dwells with an humble heart, and he gives grace to the humble, and resisteth the proud. Heaven is his throne, and the earth ye walk upon is his footstool: happy are ye that see and know him that is invisible. And now, friends, let all things be done in your meetings and otherwise, in love, with∣out strife, or vain-glory. For love fulfils the law, love overcomes and edifies the body of Christ. There is nei∣ther self, nor envy in love, neither is it puffed up; but abides and bears all things. See that this love of God have the sway in you all, and over you all. Christ saith, <Q>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteous∣ness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bles∣sed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the pro∣phets that were before you.</Q> Now friends, here is a great deal in these words. All must be in these states and con∣ditions, if they have these blessings. The children of God are peace-makers, and strive to make peace in the truth; and to live in peace with all men, if it be possible. So live in the peace and the good-will to all men; which good-will is both for their sanctification and salvation. And friends, consider, the wisdom of God, which is from above, is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hy∣pocrisy.
<PB N="319" REF="037441_0835_100D93EE50A24148"/>Dear friends, let this pure, peaceable, gentle, wisdom that is from above, that is easy to be intreated, and is full of mercy and good fruits, be exercised and practised in all the true churches of Christ; that wisdom may be justified of her children. For the works of the flesh, or fleshly spirit, are hatred, variance, wrath, strife, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, adultery, fornication, lasciviousness, uncleanness, &amp;c. and they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruits of the Spirit of God are love, joy, peace, long-suf∣fering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, &amp;c. So, dear friends and brethren, strive to exceed one another and all people upon the earth in humility, in meekness, in gentleness, in temperance, in love, in pa∣tience, in pureness, and in mercy; then ye will shew forth the fruits of the Spirit of God, and of his heavenly wis∣dom that is from above. In this, wisdom will be justified of her children; and ye will be the salt of the earth, and a light to the world set on an hill, that cannot be hid: and your moderation will appear to all men. Be ye just and righteous, faithful and true in all your words, dealings, and conversations; that ye may answer the truth in all people: for Christ saith, his father is glorified by such as bring forth fruits, when men see their good works; for he that doth righteousness, is accepted with God. And he that dwells in love, dwells in God; for love is his habitation. Let that be the habitation of every one that hath received the truth: for if it be not, such do not dwell in God, let them profess what they will. Therefore my desire is, that all you, who have received Christ the seed, which bruises the serpent's head, may walk in him your sanctuary, life, and salvation, your rest and peace, Amen.</P>

<P>I continued yet at London, labouring in the work and service of the Lord both in and out of meetings; sometimes visiting friends in prison for the testimony of Jesus, encou∣raging them in their sufferings, and exhorting them to stand faithful and steadfast in the testimony which the Lord had committed to them to bear: sometimes also visiting those that were sick and weak in body, or troubled in mind, helping to bear their spirits up from sinking under their in∣firmities.
<PB N="320" REF="037441_0836_100D93F02DCAABE8"/>Sometimes our meetings were quiet and peacea∣ble, sometimes they were disturbed and broken up by the officers. One first-day it was upon me to go to the meet∣ing at the Savoy, which was large: for many professors and sober people were there. The Lord opened many precious weighty things in me to the people, which I declared amongst them, and <Q>directed them to the spirit of God in themselves, which the Lord had given them a measure of; that all by the Spirit might understand the Scriptures, which were given forth from the Spirit of God; and that by the Spirit of God they might know God, and Christ whom God hath sent, whom to know is eternal life; and that by the Spirit they might all come into Christ, and know him to be their sanctuary, who destroys the devil, the destroyer, and his works, and bruises the serpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s head. For Christ was a sanctuary to them to whom he was a Saviour, whom he saved from the destroyer. And Christ did baptize them with the Holy Ghost and with fire, and did thoroughly purge his floor, and burn up their chaff with unquenchable fire; that is, sin and cor∣ruption, which is got into man and woman by their trans∣gression: but Christ gathereth his wheat into his garner. So all that are baptized with Christ's baptism, their wheat is in God's garner; and no spoiler can get into God's gar∣ner to meddle with the wheat there, though they may be permitted to meddle with the outward goods, &amp;c. As I was speaking in the power of the Lord, and the people were greatly affected therewith, on a sudden the constables, with the rude people, came in like a sea. One of the constables said, Come down,</Q> and laid hands on me. I asked him, 'Art thou a Christian? We are christians.' He had hold on my hand, and was very fierce to pluck me down; but I stood still, and spoke a few words to the people; desir∣ing of the Lord, that the blessings of God might rest upon them all. The constable still called upon me to come down, and at length plucked me down, and bid another man with a staff, 'Take and carry me to prison.' That man had me to another officer's house, who was more ci∣vil; and after awhile they brought in four friends more, whom they had taken. I was very weary, and in a great sweat; and several friends hearing where I was, came to me in the constable's house: but I bid them all go their ways, lest the constables and informers should stop them. After awhile the constables had us almost a mile to a jus∣tice,
<PB N="321" REF="037441_0837_100D93F24EEDFDB0"/>who was a fierce, passionate man: who, after he had asked me my name, and his clerk had taken it in writing, upon the constable's informing him, <Q>That I preached inthe meeting,</Q> said in an angry manner, <Q>Do not you know that it is contrary to the king's laws to preach in such conventicles, contrary to the liturgy of the church of England?</Q> There was present one Shad (a wicked inform∣er, who was said to have broken gaol at Coventry, and to have been burnt in the hand at London) who hearing the justice speak so to me, stepped up to him, and told him, <Q>That he had convicted them on the act of the 22d of king Charles the Second.</Q> 'What! you convict them?' said the justice. 'Yes,' said Shad, <Q>I have convicted them, and you must convict them too upon that act.</Q> With that the justice was angry with him, and said, <Q>You teach me! What are you? I'll convict them of a riot.</Q> The informer hearing that, and seeing the justice angry, went away in a fret; so he was disappointed of his purpose. I thought he would have sworn somebody against me: where∣upon I said, <Q>Let no man swear against me, for it is my principle, Not to swear;</Q> and therefore I would not 'have any man swear against me.' The justice there∣upon asked me, 'If I did not preach in the meeting?' I told him. <Q>I did confess what God and Christ had done for my soul; and did praise God. I thought I might have done that in the streets, and in all places, viz. praise God, and confess Christ Jesus; which I was not ashamed to con∣sess. Neither was this contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</Q> The justice said, <Q>The laws were against such meetings as were contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</Q> I said. <Q>I knew no such laws against our meetings; but if he did mean that act that was made against such as did meet to plot, contrive, and raise in∣surrections against the king, we were no such people, but did abhor all such actions; and did bear true love and good-will to the king, and to all men upon the earth.</Q> The justice then asked me, 'If I had been in orders?' I told him. No. Then he took his law-books, and searched for laws against us, bidding his clerk take the names of the rest the mean time. But when he could find no other law against us, the clerk swore the constable against us. Some of the friends bid the constable <Q>take heed what he swore, lest he were perjured; for he, took them in the entry, and not in the meeting.</Q> Yet the constable, being an ill man,
<PB N="322" REF="037441_0838_100D93F723CDCD50"/>swore, 'That they were in the meeting.' However, the justice said, <Q>Seeing there was but one witness, he would discharge the rest; but he would send me to Newgate, and I might preach there.</Q> I asked him, <Q>If it stood with his conscience to send me to Newgate for praising God, and for confessing Christ Jesus?</Q> He cried, <Q>Con∣science! conscience!</Q> but I felt my words touched his <Q>conscience. He bid the constable take me away, and he would make a mitrimus to send me to prison when he had dined.</Q> I told him, <Q>I desired his peace, and the good of his family; and that they might be kept in the fear of the Lord.</Q> So I passed away, and as I went the constable took some friends word that I should come to his house the next morning by the eighth hour. Accordingly I did go with those friends, and the constable told us he went to the justice for the mittimus after he had dined; and the justice bid him, 'Come again after the evening service;' which he did; and then the justice told him, <Q>He might let me go.</Q> So, said the constable, you are discharged. I blamed him for turning informer, and swearing against us. He said, 'He would do so no more.' Next day, the jus∣tice meeting with Gilbert Laty, asked him. <Q>If he would pay twenty pounds for George Fox's fine?</Q> He said, 'No.' 'Then.' said the justice, <Q>I am disappointed; for, being but a lodger, I cannot come by his fine; and he having been brought before me, and being of ability him∣self, I cannot lay his fine on any other.</Q></P>
<P>After I was discharged, I went into the city. The same week the sessions coming on, where many friends were con∣cerned, some as prisoners, and some on trials of appeals upon the conventicle act, I went to a friend's house not far off, that I might be in readiness to assist those friends with counsel, or otherwise, as occasion should offer; and I found service in it. But as my spirit was concerned on behalf of friends, with resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct to their outward sufferings by the per∣secutors without; so an exercise also came weightily upon me at this time, in the sense I had of the mischievous work∣ing of that adulterated spirit, which, being gone out from the heavenly unity, and having drawn out some that pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed truth into enmity and opposition against friends, en∣deavoured to trouble the church of Christ with their jan∣glings and contention. And as a further discovery of the working of that seducing spirit, and a warning to all friends to beware of it, I was moved to write the following epistle:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="323" REF="037441_0839_100D93F951A94938"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all the elect, faithful, called, and chosen of God, the flock and heritage of God, who, have been ac∣quainted with the dealings of the Lord, and have kept your habitations in his life, power, and truth, being built upon the holy heavenly Rock and Foun∣dation Christ Jesus, who was the foundation of the prophets and apostles; which foundation stands sure:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MANY foundations have been laid since the apostles days, by such as have gone from Christ the true and sure foundation: and their foundations have proved rotten, and come to nought, and themselves have come to loss. Many since the day of Christ, and the truth hath appear∣ed in this nation, have had some openings and sights, and come among us for a time, and then gone from us again; who have been the comers and goers, like those in the apostles days. Such had an outward profession of the truth, and have gone from the true feundation Christ Je∣sus, and so from the heavenly society and unity of the faints in light. Then they set up foundations of their own, and having a form of godliness, but out of the power there∣of, out of the order thereof, such have turned to janglings and vain disputings. This spirit you have been acquaint∣ed with, who have kept your habitations in Christ Jesus, the First and the Last. And you are not insensible of the scurrilous and filthy books of lies and defamations which have been spread abroad in this nation and beyond sea against the faithful. It is very well that the Lord hath suffered them to publish their own shame in print, that truth's enemies may be discovered; their fruits and spirits have appeared, and manifested themselves both in print and otherwise. And I believe the Lord will yet suffer this spirit so to publish its sruits, its shame and nakedness, to professor and profane, and to all sober, moderate and innocent people, that its shame and nakedness may more fully appear. Though for a time it hath been hid and covered with the sig-leaves of an outward profession, and sometimes with fawning and slattering words (as at other times it hath discovered itself by rough, lying, and defam∣ing words) vet the Lord God will blast all such vain talkers, that do not walk in the order of life, truth, and the gospel. Therefore, ye that are saithful, stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free in his go∣vemment. It is upon his shoulders: he bears it up: of
<PB N="324" REF="037441_0840_100D93FB86AD7CE8"/>the increase of it and of its peace there is no end. For all quarrellers against his order and government are not in him, nor in his heavenly, spiritual government and peace. Therefore, ye faithful ones, who have stood the trial through many persecutions, imprisonments, spoilings of goods you know there is a crown of glory laid up for you. You that suffer with Christ, shall reign with him in his kingdom of glory; ye that die with Christ, shall live with him in eternal life, in the world that bath no end, who have gone through the sufferings without, and within by false brethren, by comers and goers, that have caused the way of truth to be evil spoken of, and have been persecut∣ors of the faithful with their tongues; and by printing and publishing their lying, defaming books against the faithful. These have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirred up magistrates and priests, who were willing to get any occasion to speak evil of the right way and precious truth of Christ, by which his peo∣ple are made free: such had better never have been born. But God hath brought them to light, and their fruits and ravenous spirit are seen, savoured, and known; who are become Judas's and sons of perdition, to betray Christ now within (where he is made manifest) to the priests, ma∣gistrates, and profane, as Judas betrayed Christ without to the priests and Pilate. Though some of the magistrates and sober people see their envy and folly, and that they have more malice than matter against the faithful. The Lord will consume this Judas, or son of perdition! The Lord will consume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his coming! So let all the faithful look unto the Lord. And let that wicked son of perdition know, though he may be got as high as Judas (who was partaker of the ministry with the apostles) <Q>the Lord will consume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his coming.</Q> That is his portion. The brightness of the Lord will destroy him, and the Spirit of his mouth will consume him. And when he is destroyed and consumed, there will not be a son of perdition to betray Christ in his people, and his people that live and walk in Christ, who hath all power in hea∣ven (mark, in heaven) and in earth given to him; and with his holy and glorious power he limits and orders; so that nothing shall be done against his people, but what is suffered for their trial and their good, neither by apostates, persecutors with the tongue, Judas's, sons of perdition to
<PB N="325" REF="037441_0841_100D93FD6A4D1230"/>betray, or the outward powers to imprison, or spoil goods; all these are limited by Christ who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him. Every one's faith is to stand in him and his power. Such rejoice in his power, and see the increase of his righteous, holy, heavenly, spi∣ritual, peaceable government, in which the glorious, holy order of life is lived and walked in by all his sons and daughters; and in his Spirit is the holy unity and bond of peace. Though ye be absent in body one from another, yet all joying and rejoicing, being present in his Spirit, and beholding in the same Spirit your spiritual order, unity, fellowship, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ Jesus, who is steadfast for ever, the First and the Last, whose presence is among his people, and who is their head. Here is heavenly Sion known, and heavenly Jerusalem, and the innumerable company of angels (which are spirits) and the spirits of the just men made perfect. Here is the general assembly, or general meeting, and a general heavenly, holy, and spiritual joy and rejoicing, lauding and praising the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb that lives for evermore, Amen.</P>

<P>Read this in your assemblies amongst the faithful.</P>
<P>I tarried a little in London, visiting friends and meetings, and labouring in the work of the Lord. And being on a first-day at the Bull and Mouth, where the meeting had long been kept without, it was that day in the house, peace∣able and large: the people were so affected with the truth, and refreshed with the powerful presence of the Lord, that when the meeting ended, they were loth to go away.</P>
<P>After some time, having several things upon me to write, I went to Kingston, that I might be free from interruptions. When I came there, I understood the officers had been very rude at the meeting, abusing friends, and had driven them out of the meeting-place, and very abusive they continued to be for some time. Whilst I was there I wrote a little book (printed soon after) the title whereof was: <Q>The saints heavenly and spiritual worship, unity, and communion, &amp;c. wherein is set forth what the true gospel-worship is, and in what the true unity and communion of the saints stands;
<PB N="326" REF="037441_0842_100D940008A564E8"/>with a discovery of those that were gone from this holy unity and communion, and were turned against the saints that abode therein.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>When I had finished the services for which I went thi∣ther, and had visited the friends, I returned to London, and visited most of the meetings in and about the city. After∣wards I went to visit a friend in Essex; and returning by Dalston, I made some stay at the widow Stot's, where I wrote an epistle to friends, which may be read amongst my other printed books.</P>
<P>I came from Dalston to London, and the next day was sent for in haste to my son Rouse's at Kingston; whose daughter Margaret lay very sick, and had a desire to see me. I tarried at Kingston about a week, and then returned to London; where I continued most part of the winter and the spring following, until the general meeting in 1684 (save that I went once as far as Enfield, to visit friends there∣abouts.) In this time I ceased not to labour in the work of the Lord, being frequent at meetings, and visiting friends that were prisoners. or that were sick, and in writing books for the spreading of truth, and opening the understandings of people to receive it.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was in the third month. A blessed, weighty meeting it was, wherein friends were sweetly re∣freshed together; for the Lord was with us, and opened his heavenly treasures amongst us. And though it was a time of great difficulty and danger, by reason of informers and persecuting magistrates, yet the Lord was a defence and place of safety to his people.</P>
<P>Now I had drawings in Spirit to go into Holland, to visit the seed of God in those provinces. And as soon as the yearly meeting was over, I prepared for my journey. There went with me from London Alexander Parker. George Watts, and Nathaniel Brassey, who also had draw∣ings into that country. We took coach the 31st of the third month 1684, and got to Colchester that night. Next day, being first-day, we went to the meeting there; and though there was no notice given of my coming, our being there was presently spread over the town, and in several places in the country, at seven and ten miles distance; so that abun∣dance of friends came in double-horsed, which made the meeting very large. I had a concern and travail in my mind, lest this great gathering should have stirred up the town, and been more than the magistrates could well bear;
<PB N="327" REF="037441_0843_100D940245577650"/>but it was very quiet and peaceable, and a glorious meeting we had, to the settling and stablishing of friends both in the town and country: for the Lord's power was over all; blessed be his name for ever! Truly, the Lord's power and presence was beyond words; for I was but weak to go into a meeting, and my face (by reason of a cold) was sore: but God manifested his strength in us and with us, and all was well; the Lord have the glory for evermore for his support∣ing power. After the meeting came, I think, above an hun∣dred friends of the town and country to see me at John Furley's. Very glad we were to see one another, and great∣ly refreshed we were together, being filled with the love and riches of the Lord; blessed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>We tarried at Colchester two days more; which we spent in visiting friends, both at their meetings for business, and at their houses. Early in the morning on fourth-day we took coach for Harwich, where we met William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield, who went over with us. About the eighth hour at night we went on board the paquet-boat, Richard Gray, master; but by reason of contrary winds it was the first hour in the morning before we sailed. We had a very good passage; and about the fifth hour in the afternoon next day we landed at the Brill in Holland, where we staid that night. Early next morning we went to Rotterdam, where we abode some days. The next day after we came to Rotterdam, one Wilbert Frouzen, a burgo∣master, and kinsman of Aarent Sunneman's, hearing I was there, invited me to his country-house, having a desire to speak with me about some business relating to Aarent Sun∣neman's daughters. I took George Watts with me, and a brother of Aarent Sunneman's had us thither. The burgo∣master received us very kindly, was glad to see me, and entering into discourse about his kinsman's daughters, I found he was apprehensive that, their father being dead, and having left them considerable portions, they might be stolen, and married to their disadvantage. Wherefore I told him, <Q>It was our principle and practice, that none should marry amongst us, unless they had a certificate of the consent of their relations or guardians; for it was our Christian care to watch over and look after all young people that came among us, especially those whose relations were dead. And as for his kinsiman's daughters, we should take care that nothing should be offered to them but what should be agreeable to truth and righteousness, and that they
<PB N="328" REF="037441_0844_100D940490C5CED8"/>might be preserved in the fear of God, according to their father's mind.</Q> This seemed to give him great satisfaction. While I was with him, there came many great people to me; and <Q>I exhorted them all to keep in the feat of God, and to mind his good Spirit in them, to keep their minds to the Lord.</Q> After I had staid two or three hours, and discoursed with them of several things, I took my leave, and he very kindly sent me to Rotterdam in his chariot.</P>
<P>Next day, being first-day, we were at the meeting at Rotterdam, which was pretty large, and declared to the people by an interpreter. The day following alderman Gaul came to speak with me, with whom we had much discourse about religious matters; wherewith he seemed to be well satisfied, and was very tender. Several other per∣sons of account intended to have come to speak with me, but being hindered by extraordinary business (as I under∣stood) they came not.</P>
<P>We went next day from Rotterdam to Amsterdam, where we had a large and very precious meeting. In the after∣noon I was at another meeting with friends there, about business.</P>
<P>There is a yearly meeting at Amsterdam for the friends of Holland and Germany, &amp;c. which begun now the eighth of the fourth month, and ended the twelfth. Here we had a fine opportunity of seeing friends from divers parts, and of being refreshed together in the love of God. After this meeting, before those that came out of the several provinces were gone, we had a meeting with some particular friends, about the places and countries into which we, who came out of England in the work of the ministry, were to travel; and to inquire who among them were suitable persons to go along with us as interpreters. This concluded on, William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield took shipping for Fries∣land, with Jacob Claus their interpreter.</P>
<P>Alexander Parker and George Watts remained with me. We tarried a few days longer at Amsterdam, where I had further service. Before I left Amsterdam. I went to visit Galenus Abrahams, a teacher of chief note among the Men∣nonites, or Baptists. I had been with him when I was in Holland about seven years before; and William Penn and George Keith had disputes with him. He was then very high and very shy, so that he would not let me touch him, nor look upon him (by his good-will) but bid me "Keep my eyes off him; for," he said, "they pierced him." But
<PB N="329" REF="037441_0845_100D9406C8A0B1C8"/>now he was very loving and tender, and confessed in some measure to truth: his wife also and daughter were tender and kind, and we parted from them very lovingly. Feeling our spirits drawn toward Friesland, Alexander Parker, George Watts, and I, having John Claus of Amsterdam with us for our interpreter, took shipping at Amsterdam for Friesland, and having sailed nine or ten leagues, we left the ship and travelled through Friesland, visiting friends and tender people in the towns and villages, having commonly one, sometimes two meetings in a day. After we had been at Leuwarden, we passed by Franeker to Harlingen in West-Friesland, which was the furthest place we went to that way. And having been out six days from Amsterdam, and had very good service in that time, in visiting friends and pub∣lishing truth amongst the people, we took ship at Harlingen for Amsterdam the 26th of the fourth month, and arrived there that night. The first-day following we were at the meeting at Amsterdam, which was very large and precious. Many of the people were there, and some of their teachers, some great persons also. They seemed very attentive, and a good opportunity we all had, one after another, to de∣clare the word of the Lord and open the way of truth amongst them, John Claus interpreting for us. I tarried the next day at Amsterdam; but George Watts went to a burial at Harlem, where many hundreds of people were; amongst whom he had a good opportunity and came back at night to us.</P>
<P>The day following we went by boat to Osanoverton in Wa∣terland, and from thence in another small boat about a league over a small river, where we passed over and by an hundred bridges, and so to Lansmeer to a friend's, whose name was Timon Peters; where we had a very good meeting. We returned to Amsterdam at night, and were at the meeting there next day. Many were at this meeting besides friends, among the rest the great Baptist-teacher Galenus, who was very attentive to the testimony of the truth, and when the meeting was done came and got me by the hand very lov∣ingly.</P>
<P>We went next day by boat to Alkmaer, about eight leagues from Amsterdam, passing through Sardam, the great town of ship-carpenters, and several other towns in the way. At Alkmaer, which is a pretty city, we staid and had a meeting next day at William Williams's. There were, be∣sides friends, many very sober people at this meeting, who
<PB N="330" REF="037441_0846_100D940A17127A98"/>were very attentive to the testimonies of truth that were borne by Alexander Parker, George Watts, and myself, John Claus being our interpreter. This was on a sixth-day, and on the seventh we returned to Amsterdam, being willing to be at the meeting on first-day, because it was like to be the last meeting we should have there. Accordingly we were at it, and a very large and open meeting it was. Many great persons were present, some earls, we were told, with their attendants, out of Germany, who were very grave and sober; and the everlasting gospel was preached unto them.</P>
<P>After this meeting we took leave of the friends of Am∣sterdam, and next morning departed to Harlem, where we had a meeting at a friend's, whose name is Abraham Fron∣denberg. Great numbers of people were at this meeting, and of great service it was. After the meeting, a watch∣maker of Amsterdam, who with his wife was at the meet∣ing, desired to speak with me concerning religion. I had pretty much discourse with him, and both he and she were very low and tender, received with gladness what I spoke to them, and seemed to depart well satisfied.</P>
<P>We went next day to Rotterdam, where we tarried two meetings, and the sixteenth of the fifth month went to the Brill, to take ship for England.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon, we went on board the pack∣et-boat, William Sherman, master, and set sail from the Brill. When we had gone over the Mase about a league, we cast anchor at a place called the Pit, because it is near the sands, where we tarried till about four next morning; when having a pretty fair wind, and the tide with us, we weighed anchor, and by four next day were within five leagues of Harwich, over against Alborough castle; but the wind falling short, and the tide being weak, it was the first hour in the afternoon before we came so near Harwich that boats could come to receive the passengers and goods. There were on board about forty passengers in all, of which some were English, some Scots, some Dutch, some French, some Spanish, some Flemish, and some Jews.</P>
<P>I spent a day with friends at Harwich, while Alexander Parker and George Watts went to visit friends at Ipswich, and returned at night. Next morning early we all took coach for Colchester, and were at the meeting there, which was large and peaceable; after the meeting we travelled to Witham and lodged there that night. Next day, William
<PB N="331" REF="037441_0847_100D940BA75AA948"/>Mead meeting us on the way at Harestreet, I went with him to his house, and the other friends went for London.</P>
<P>Here, being weak with travel and continual exercise, I spent some time to rest myself and recover my health; visiting in the meantime friends in that part of the country as I was able to get abroad. When I was a little recovered I went to Enfield, visiting friends there and thereabouts, so to Dal∣ston to see the widow Stot, and from thence to London; some friends being come over from New-Jersey in America about business which I was desired to be present at.</P>
<P>It was the latter end of the summer when I came to Lon∣don, where I staid the winter following; save once or twice, my wife being in town with me, I went with her to her son Rouse's at Kingston. And though my body was very weak, yet I was in continual service either in publick meetings, when I was able to bear them, or in particular businesses among friends, and visiting those that were suffer∣ers for truth, either by imprisonment or loss of goods. Many things also in this time I wrote, some for the press and some for particular service; as letters to the king of Denmark, and one to the duke of Holstein, on behalf of friends that were sufferers in his dominions; whereof the fol∣lowing is a copy:</P>

<P>I UNDERSTAND that formerly, by some evil-minded persons, it was reported to thee, when Elizabeth Hen∣dricks came to Frederickstadt to visit the people called Quakers, <Q>that it was a scandal to the christian religion that a woman should be suffered to preach in a publick assembly religiously gathered together,</Q> &amp;c. Upon which thou gavest forth an order to the rulers of Frede∣rickstadt, <Q>to make the said people leave that place forth∣with, or to send them away.</Q> But the said Rulers being Arminians, and they or their fathers being come to live there as a people persecuted in Holland, not much above threescore years ago, made answer to the duke, <Q>they were not willing to persecute others for conscience-sake, who had looked upon persecution on that account in their own case as antichristian,</Q> &amp;c. But after that, the peo∣ple
<PB N="332" REF="037441_0848_100D940E283FAA48"/>of God, in scorn called Quakers, did write to thee, from Frederickstadt; and since that time they have had their liberty, and their meetings peaceable, to serve and worship God almost these twenty years at Frederickstadt and thereabouts, freely without molestation; which liberty they have acknowledged as a great favour and kindness from thee.</P>
<P>And now, O duke, thou professing christianity from the great and mighty name of Christ Jesus who is King of kings and Lord of lords, and the holy scriptures of truth of the Old and New Testament, do not you use many women's words in your service and worship out of the Old and New Testament? The apostle saith, <Q>Let your women keep silence in the churches;</Q> and that he <Q>did not permit a woman to speak, but to be under obedience; and if she will learn any thing, to ask her husband at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</Q> And 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12. <Q>Women are to learn in silence, and not suffered to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence,</Q> 1 Cor. xiv. 34. Here the duke may see what sort of women were to be in silence and subjection, whom the law commands to be silent, and not to unsurp authority over the man, nor to speak in the church; these were unruly women. In the same chapter he commands <Q>not to plait nor broider their hair, nor to wear gold, pearls, or costly array.</Q> These things were forbidden by the apostle, and women that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ear such things are to learn in silence and to be subject, and not to usurp authority over the men; for it is a shame for such to speak in the church. But do not such women as these that wear gold and silver, pearls and gaudy appa∣rel, or costly array, and plait and broider their hair, speak in your church, when your priest sets them to sing psalms? Don't they speak when they sing psalms? Con∣sider this, O duke! Yet you say, <Q>Your women must keep silence in the church, and must not speak in the church;</Q> but when they sing psalms in your churches are they silent? Though the apostle forbids such women as before-mentioned to speak in the church, yet in another place he encourages the good or holy women to be teach∣ers of good things, Tit. ii. 3.4. The apostle also said, <Q>I intreat thee, true yoke-follow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, and with other my follow-labourers, whose names are written in the book of life.</Q>
<PB N="333" REF="037441_0849_100D9410EDAF2120"/>Here he owns these holy women, and encourages them which laboured with him in the gospel, and did not for∣bid them, Phil. iv. 2, 3. He likewise commends Phoebe unto the church of the Romans, calls her a <Q>servant un∣to the church of Cenchrea,</Q> sends his epistle by her to the Romans from Corinth, and desires the church at Rome to "receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints;" and to assist her, <Q>in whatsoever business she had need of; for she had been a succourer of many, and of him also:</Q> And he said, <Q>Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus, who have for my life laid down their necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.</Q> Now here the duke may see, these were good holy women, whom the apostle did not forbid speaking. Rom. xvi. 1, 2, 3, 4. but commended them. And Priscilla and Aquila <Q>instructed and expounded unto Apollos the way of God more perfectly,</Q> Acts xviii. 26. So here Priscilla was an instructor as well as Aquila, which holy women the apostle doth not forbid. Neither did he forbid Philip's four daughters, who were virgins, to prophesy. Women might pray and prophesy in the church, 1 Cor. xi. 5. The apostles shewed to the Jews the fulfilling of Joel's prophecy: <Q>That in the last days God would pour out of his Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and daughters, servants and handmaids, should prophesy with the Spirit of God.</Q> So the apostle en∣courages daughters and handmaids to prophesy, as well as sons; and if they do prophesy, they must speak to the church or people, Joel ii. 28. Acts xvii. 18. Did not Miriam the prophetess sing unto the Lord, and all the women with her, when the Lord had delivered the chil∣dren of Israel from Pharaoh? Did not she praise the Lord, and prophesy in the congregation of the children of Israel? Was not this in the church? Exod. xv. 21. Moses and Aaron did not forbid her prophesying or speaking; but Moses said, <Q>Would God all the Lord's people were prophets!</Q> And the Lord's people are wo∣men as well as men. Deborah was a judge and a pro∣phetess; and do not you make use of Deborah's and Mi∣riam's words in your service and worship? See Jud. v. 1. to 31. Deborah's large speech or song. Barak did not forbid her, nor none of the Jewish priests. Did not she make this speech or song in the congregation or church of Israel? In the book of Ruth there are good speeches of
<PB N="334" REF="037441_0850_100D9412E1F4F288"/>those good women, which were not forbidden. Hannah prayed in the temple before Eli, and the Lord answered her prayer. See what a speech Hannah makes, and a praising of God before Eli the high priest, who did not forbid her, 1 Sam. ii. 1. to 10. Josiah the king sent his priest, with several others, to ask counsel of Huldah the prophetess, who dwelt at Jerusalem in the college, 2 King. xxii. 14.2 Chron. xxxiv. 22. So here the king and his priests did not despise the counsel of this prophetess; and she prophesied to the congregation of Israel, as may be seen in these chapters. In Luke i. 41. to 55. see what a godly speech Mary made also. Mary said, <Q>that the Lord did regard the low estate of his handmaid,</Q> &amp;c. And don't you make use in your worship and service of Mary's and Elizabeth's words from Luke ii. 41. to 55. in your churches, and yet forbid women's speaking in your churches, and but to be in silence? Yet all sorts of wo∣men speak in your churches when they sing, and say Amen. In Luke ii. there was Anna the prophetess, a widow, of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayer night and day. Did not she confess Christ Jesus in the temple, and give thanks to the Lord, <Q>and speak of Christ to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem?</Q> Luke ii. 36, 37, 38. So such holy women were not for∣bidden to speak in the church, neither in the law nor gos∣pel. Was it not Mary Magdalen and other women that first preached Christ's resurrection to the apostles? The woman indeed (namely Eve) was first in transgression; so they were women that first preached the resurrection of Christ Jesus; for Christ said to Mary, &amp;c. <Q>Go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and to your Father, and to my God and to your God,</Q> John xx. 17. And Luke xxiv. 10. It was Mary Mag∣dalen, Johanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told the apostles, <Q>Christ was risen from the dead; and their words and these women's words were as idle tales to the apostles, and they believed them not,</Q> ib. 11. Ver. 22. <Q>Certain women also of our company made us astonished,</Q> they said. So here it may be seen that the women's preaching the resurrection of Christ did astonish the apostles. Christ sent these women to preach his resurrection; so it is no shame for such wo∣men
<PB N="335" REF="037441_0851_100D941472CD62E8"/>to preach Christ Jesus, neither are they to be silent when Christ sends them. The apostle says, <Q>Every tongue shall confess to God,</Q> Rom. xiv. 11, and <Q>Every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glo∣ry of God the Father,</Q> Philip. ii. 11. So here it is clear that women must confess Christ as well as men, if every tongue must confess. And the apostle saith, <Q>There's neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus,</Q> Gal. iii. 28.</P>
<P>And whereas it is said, <Q>women must ask their hus∣bands at home,</Q> &amp;c. the duke knows very well, virgins have no husbands, nor widows; for Anna, the prophetess, was a widow; and if Christ be the husband, men must ask counsel of him at home, as well as women, before they teach. And set the case that a Turk's wife should be a Christian, or a Papist's wife should be a Lutheran, or a Calvinist, must they ask and learn of their husbands at home before they confess Christ Jesus in the congregation of the Lord? Their counsel will be to them to turn Turks or Papists.</P>
<P>I intreat the duke to consider these things. I intreat him to mind God's grace and truth in his heart, that is come by Jesus Christ, that by his Spirit of grace and truth he may come to serve and worship God in his Spirit and truth; so that he may serve the living eternal God that made him, in his generation, and have his peace in Christ that the world cannot take away. And I do desire his good, peace, and prosperity in this world, and his eternal comfort and happiness in the world that is everlasting, Amen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN whom you have life, peace, and salvation; walk in him who is your heavenly Rock and Foundation, that stands sure, who hath all power in heaven and earth given unto him. So his power is over all. Let your faith stand in his power, which is over all from everlasting to ever∣lasting, over the devil and his power; that in the holy
<PB N="336" REF="037441_0852_100D9416669B1650"/>heavenly wisdom of God ye may be preserved and kept to God's glory, out of all snares and temptations; that God's wisdom may be justified of all his children in this day of his power, and they all may be faithful, serving and wor∣shipping God in spirit and truth, and valiant for it upon the earth. For, as the apostle saith, <Q>They that believe are entered into their rest, and have ceased from their own works, as God did from his.</Q> Now this rest is an eternal rest in Christ, the eternal Son of God, in whom every true believer hath everlasting life in Christ Jesus, their rest and everlasting day. For Christ the rest bruiseth the serpent's head, and through death destroyeth death, and the devil, the power of death, and his works. He is the eternal rest, that giveth eternal life to his sheep. Christ fulfilleth the prophets, and all the figures, shadows, and ceremonies, as in the Old Testament; and all the promises are yea and amen in Christ, who was the eternal rest to all true believers in the apostles days, and ever since, and is so now. Christ is the beginning and the ending, the first and last, ascended above all principalities, powers, thrones, and dominions, that he might fill all things. For by <Q>Jesus Christ all things were made and created, whe∣ther they be things in heaven or things in the earth;</Q> and he is the Eternal Rest. They that believe are entered in∣to Christ, their Eternal Rest, in whom they have eternal life, and peace with God. Wherefore I say again, in him who is your Rest live and abide; for in him ye are happy, and his blessings will rest upon you. God Al∣mighty keep and preserve you all, his true believers, in Christ your Rest and Peace this day. Amen.</P>

<P>About a month after I got a little out of London, visit∣ing friends at South-street, Ford-green, and Enfield, where I had meetings. Afterwards I went to Waltham-abbey, and was at a meeting there on a first-day; which was very large and peaceable. Then returning through Enfield, and about Edmonton-side, I came back to London in the third month, to advise with and assist friends in laying their suf∣ferings before the parliament then sitting; and we drew up a short account of our sufferings, which we caused to be printed and spread amongst the parliament-men.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="037441_0853_100D94191BB73700"/>
The yearly meeting coming on, I was much concerned for friends that came up to it out of the country, lest they should meet with any trouble or disturbance in their passage up or down; and the rather, because about that time a great bustle arose in the nation upon the duke of Mon∣mouth's landing in the West. But the Lord, according to his wonted goodness, was graciously pleased to preserve friends in safety, and gave us a blessed opportunity to meet together in peace and quietness, and accompanied our meet∣ing with his living, refreshing presence: blessed for ever be his holy name!</P>
<P>Considering the hurries that were in the nation, it came upon me at the close of this meeting to write a few lines to friends, <Q>to caution all to keep out of the spirit of the world, in which trouble is, and to dwell in the peaceable truth;</Q> as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord hath called and chosen in Christ Jesus, your Life and Salvation, in whom ye have rest and peace with God; the Lord by his mighty power, which is over all, hath preserved and supported you to this day, to be a peculiar holy people to himself, so that by his eternal Spirit and power ye might be all kept out of the world; for in the world is trouble. In this great day of the Lord God Almighty, he is shaking the heavens and the earth of outward professions, their elements are in a heat, their sun and their moon are darkened, the stars falling, and the mountains and hills shaking and tottering, as it was among the Jews in the day of Christ's appearing. Therefore, dear friends and brethren, dwell in the Seed, Christ Jesus, the Rock and Foundation, that cannot be shaken; that ye may see with the light and Spirit of Christ, that ye are as fixed stars in the firmament of God's power; and in this his power and light you'll see over all the wan∣dering stars, clouds without water, and trees without fruit. That which may be shaken will be shaken, as will all that are wandered from the firmament of God's power.</P>
<P>Dear friends and brethren, you that are redeemed from the death and fall of Adam, by Christ the second Adam, in him ye have life, rest, and peace; for Christ saith, <Q>In me ye shall have peace, but in the world trouble.</Q> And the apostle saith, <Q>They that believe are entered into their Rest,</Q> namely Christ, who bath overcome the world,
<PB N="338" REF="037441_0854_100D941B3AC2C150"/>bruiseth the serpent's head, destroys the devil and his works, and fulfils the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament, and the prophets. In whom the pro∣mises are Yea and Amen; who is the First and Last, Beginning and Ending, the Eternal Rest. So keep and walk in Christ, your Rest, every one that have received him.</P>
<P>Dear friends and brethren, whatever bustlings and trou∣ble, tumults or outrages, quarrels and strife, arise in the world, keep out of them all; concern not yourselves with them; but keep in the Lord's power and peaceable truth, that is over all such things; in which power ye seek the peace and good of all men. Live in the love which God hath shed abroad in your hearts through Christ Jesus; in which love nothing is able to separate you from God and Christ, neither outward sufferings, persecutions, nor any outward thing that is below and without; nor to hinder or break your heavenly fellowship in the light, gospel, and spirit of Christ, nor your holy communion in the Holy Ghost, that proceeds from the Father and the Son, which leads you into all truth. In this Holy Ghost, in which is your holy communion, that proceeds from the Father and the Son, you have fellowship with the Father and the Son, and one with another. This is it which links and joins Christ's church or body together to him the heaven∣ly and spiritual head, and in unity in his Spirit, which is the bond of peace to all his church and living members, in whom they have eternal rest and peace in Christ, and with God everlasting, who is to be blessed and praised for ever, Amen!</P>
<P>Dear friends, forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, who are gathered in the name of Jesus, your prophet, whom God has raised up in the New Testament, to be heard in all things; who opens to you, and no man can shut, who shuts and no man can open; He is your priest, made higher than the heavens by the power of an endless life; by him you are made a royal priesthood, to offer up to God spiritual sacrifice; He is the bishop of your souls, to oversee you, that you do not go astray from God; He is the good shepherd that hath laid down his life for his sheep, and they hear his voice and follow him, and he gives to them eternal life.</P>
<P>Dear friends and brethren, abide in Christ the vine, that ye may bring forth fruit to the Glory of God. As
<PB N="339" REF="037441_0855_100D941CD0F01EE0"/>every one hath received Christ, walk in him, who is not of the world that lies in wickedness; so that ye may be preserved out of the vain fashions and customs of the world which satisfy the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world that passes away. Whoever joins to that which is not of the Father, or encourages it, draws the mind from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore let Christ rule in your hearts, that your minds, souls, and spirits may be kept out of the vanities of the world in their words, ways, and actions, that ye may be a peculiar people, zealous of good works, serving the Lord through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God; that by the Word of his grace your words may be gra∣cious, and in your lives and conversations ye may shew forth righteousness, holiness, and godliness, that God Al∣mighty may be glorified in you all, and through you all, who is above all, blessed and praised for ever, Amen.</P>

<P>I wrote several other letters to friends, in divers foreign countries, from whom I had received letters about the affairs of truth. Which when I had dispatched, I got a little way out of town, being much spent with the heat of the weather, throngs in meetings, and continual business. I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first to South-street, where I abode some days. And a great sense entered me of the growth and increase of pride, vanity, and excess in apparel, and that not only amongst the people of the world, but too much also in some that came among us, and seemed to make profession of the truth. In the sense I had of the evil thereof, it came upon me to give sorth the following, as a reproof and check thereunto.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The apostle Peter saith (in 1 Pet. iii.) of the women's adorning; <Q>Let it not be (mark, let it not be: this is a positive prohibition) that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price; for af∣ter this manner in old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves.</Q></P>
<P>Here ye may see what is the ornament of the holy wo∣men,
<PB N="340" REF="037441_0856_100D941E871CADC0"/>which was in the sight of God of great price, which the holy women who trusted in God adorned themselves with. But the unholy women, that trust not in God, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnament is not a meek and a quiet spirit; they adorn themselves with plaiting the hair, putting on of apparel, and wearing of gold, which is forbidden by the aposlle in his general epistle to the church of Christ, the true Chris∣trans.</P>
<P>The apostle Paul saith. 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10. <Q>In like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest ap∣parel, with shamesacedness and sobriety, not with broi∣dered hair or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but, which becometh women professing godliness, with good works.</Q></P>
<P>Here ye may see what the women were not to adorn themselves with who professed godliness: they were not to adorn themselves with who professed godliness: they were not to adorn themselves with broidered hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor costly array; for this was not looked upon to be mo∣dest apparel for holy women that professed godliness and good works. But this adorning or apparel is for the im∣modest, unshamefaced, unsober women. that profess not godliness, neither follow those good works that God com∣mands. Therefore it doth not become men and women, who prosess true Christianity and godliness, to be adorned with gold. or chains, or pearls, or costly array, or with broidered hair; for these things are for the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and pride of life, which is not of the Father. All holy men and women are to mind that which is more precious than gold; <Q>being redeemed not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation, but with the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and without spot. Therefore as obedient children to God, not fashioning yourselves ac∣cording to your former lusis in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation</Q> 1 Pet. i. 14.15.</P>
<P>Christ saith <Q>The life is more than meat, and the bo∣dy is more than raiment.</Q>Luke xii. 23.</P>
<P>I read of a wise moral philosopher, who, meeting a wo∣man with her neck and breast Lare, laid his hand upon her and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l "Woman, wilt thou sell this flesh?" and she re∣plying. No: "Then pray," said he, "shut up thy shop" (meaning her bare breasts and neck). So they were look∣ed upon as harlot's that went with their necks, breasts, and
<PB N="341" REF="037441_0857_100D94217317AA88"/>backs bare, and not modest people, even among the mo∣ral heathens. Therefore those that profess the knowledge of true Christianity should be ashamed of such things. You may see a book written by the very Papists, and an∣other by Richard Baxter the Presbyterian, against bare breasts and bare backs. They that were but in an out∣ward profession did declare against such things, therefore they who are in the possession of truth and true Christiani∣ty should be ashamed of such things. Read, I pray you, the third of Isaiah. There you may see the holy prophet was grieved with the foolish women's vain attire. and was sent by the Lord to reprove them. Envious, persecuting Jezebel, her attired head and br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very, like a painted harlot out of the truth, did not keep her from the judgments of God, when the Lord stirred up Jehu against her. Doth not pride go before a fall, and a haughty mind before de∣struction? <Q>God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</Q> Solomon saith, <Q>The Lord will destroy the house of the proud,</Q> Prov. xv. 25. <Q>For the day of the Lord shall be upon every one that is proud and lof∣ty &amp;c. and he shall be brought low,</Q> Isa. ii. 12. and Mal. iv. Therefore take heed of calling the proud happy; for <Q>the Lord will scatter the proud in the imagination of their own hearts, and exalt them of low degree.</Q> You may read in the Revelations (Chap. xvii. 4. and xviii. 16.) of the false church, how she was outwardly decked, but full of abomination, and came to a downfal at last. There∣fore it is good for all that profess the truth, to use this world as not abusing it; <Q>for the fashion of this world passeth away, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. The Lord taketh pleasure in his people, he will beautify the meek with salvation,</Q> Psal. cxlix. 4. All that know the truth as it is in Jesus, are to be beautified and clothed with this salvation, which salvation is a strong wall or a bulwark against that spirit that would lead you further in∣to the sall from God, into those things which the fallen man and woman delight in, beautify, or adorn themselves with. Therefore, all that profess the truth, be circum∣spect, sincere, and fervent, following the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not of this world; in whom ye have life and peace with God.</P>

After some weeks I returned to London. Among other services that I found there, one was to assist in drawing up a testimony to clear our friends of being concerned in the late rebellion in the west, and from all plots against the go∣vernment; which accordingly was done, and delivered to the chief justice, who was then to go into the west with commission to try prisoners.</P>
<P>I tarried some time in London, visiting meetings, and labouring among friends in the service of truth. But find∣ing my health much impaired for want of fresh air, I went to Charles Bathurst's country-house at Epping-forest, where I staid a few days. There it came upon me to write the following epistle to friends:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO are called, chosen and faithful in this day of trial, temptations, and sufferings, whom the Lord by his right hand hath upholden in all your sufferings (and some to death) for the Lord and his truth's sake. Christ saith, <Q>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world; in me ye have peace, but in the world ye have trouble.</Q> The children of the Seed, which be heirs of the kingdom, know this is true. And though ye have trials by false brethren, Judases, and sons of perdition, that are got into the temple of God, and exalted above all that is called God, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth and the brightness of his coming; and though ye be tried by powers and principalities, yet there is nothing able to separate you from the love of God which ye have in Christ Jesus. In that love dwell, which bears all things, and fulfils the law; in which edify one another, and be courtcous, kind, and humble; for to such God giveth his grace plentifully, such he teacheth. And pray in the Holy Ghost, which proceeds from the Father and the Son; in it keep your holy communion and unity in the Spirit, the bond of peace, which is the King of kings heavenly peace. In that you are all bound to good behaviour, to keep peace among yourselves, to seek the peace of all men, and to shew forth the heavenly, gentle, and peaceable wisdom to all, in righteousness and truth, answering the good in all people in your lives and con∣versations (for the Lord is glorified in your bringing forth piritual fruit:) that ye may eye and behold the Lord in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your actions, that the blessings of the Lord ye may all
<PB N="343" REF="037441_0859_100D7FA70F20AA58"/>feel to rest upon you. Whether ye be the Lord's prison∣ers for his name and truth's sake, or at liberty, in all things labour to be content, for that is a continual feast; and let no trouble move you; then ye will be as Mount Sion that cannot be removed. In all things exercise the word of patience, which word will sanctify all things to you. Study to be quiet, and do the Lord's business that he requires of you, and your own, in truth and righteous∣ness. Whatsoever ye do, let it be done to the praise and glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ. All that make God's people suffer, make the seed suffer in their own par∣tieulars, and imprison the just there. Such will not-visit the seed in themselves, but cast it into prison-in others, and not visit it in prison. You may read that Christ, saith, "Such must go into everlasting punishment." That is a sad punishment and prison. All such as are become apostates and backsliders, that crucify to themselves Christ afresh, put him to open shame, trample under feet the blood of the Son of God by which they were cleansed, and come to be unclean; such grieve, vex, quench, and rebel against the Spirit of God in themselves, and then such rebel against them that walk in the Spirit of God. Such are unfaithful to God and man, and are enemies to every good work and service of God; but their end will be according to their works, who are like the earth that hath often received rain, but brings forth briers and thorns, which are to be rejected, and are for the fire. Therefore, dear friends, in all your sufferings feel the Lord's eternal arm and power, which hath supported you to this day, and will to the end, as your faith stands in it, and as you are settled upon the rock and foundation Christ Jesus, that cannot be removed, in whom ye have life and peace with God. The Lord God Almighty, in him, give you do∣minion, and preserve you all to his glory, that in all your sufferings ye may feel his presence, and that, when ye have finished your testimony, ye may receive the crown of glory which God hath laid up for them that fear and serve him, Amen.</P>

<P>Having spent about a week in the country, I returned to London; where I continued about two months, visiting
<PB N="344" REF="037441_0860_100D94258D304C08"/>meetings, and labouring to get relief for friends from their sufferings, which yet lay heavy upon them in many parts of the nation. I also wrote several papers relating to the ser∣vice of truth, one of which was concerning order in the church of God, which some that were gone out of the unity of friends did much oppose. It was as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>AMONG all societies, or families, or nations of peo∣ple in the world, they have among them some sort of order. There was the order of Aaron in the Old Tes∣tament, and there was the order of Melchisedeck before that, after whose order Christ Jesus came, and he did not despise that order. God is a God of order in his whole creation, and in his church; and all believers in the light, the life in Christ, that pass from death to life, are in the order of the Holy Spirit, power, light, life, and govern∣ment of Christ Jesus, of the increase whereof there is no end. This is a mystery to all those disorderly people, who have written and printed so much against order, which the Lord's power and Spirit hath brought forth among his people. And you that cry so much agianst order, is it not manifest that you are gone into a land of darkness, thick as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death, into disorder, and where the light is as darkness? Is not this your condition seen by all them that live and walk in the truth, and whose conversations are according to the gospel of life and salvation?</P>
<P>The devil, Satan, dragon, the first and second beast, the whore and false prophets, and their worshippers and followers, all are out of the truth, abode not in it, nor in the order of it: and the truth is over them all. In Salem is God's tabernacle; and his tabernacle is in Shiloh: these are far beyond the tabernacles of Ham, Psalm lxxvi, and lxxviii.</P>
<P>All the figures and shadows were and are comprehend∣ed in time; but Christ the substance is the beginning and the ending. And all trials, troubles, persecutions, and temptations came up in time: but the Lord's power, which is everlasting, is over all such things; in which is safety.</P>
<P>The black world of darkness lieth in wickedness, and by their wisdom know not God that made the world and all things therein: for the god of the world and prince of the air ruleth in the hearts of all that disobey the living
<PB N="345" REF="037441_0861_100D94272312AB10"/>God who made them. So the god of this wicked world hath blinded the eyes of the insidels or heathen; so that this wicked world by their wisdom doth not know the living God.</P>
<P>In the Old Testament the Lord said, <Q>With all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.</Q> Levit. ii. 13. And Christ saith in his new covenant. <Q>Every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good; but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another,</Q> Mark ix. 48, 49, 50.</P>
<P>We have received the earnest of the Spirit, which is the carnest of the inheritance that fadeth not away. For God poureth out of his Spirit upon all flesh. It is God's Spirit, which is above our natural spirit (by which alone we do not know God;) for it is by the Spirit of God that we know the things of God. And the Spirit of God doth witness to our souls and spirits, that it self is the earnest of an eternal inheritance. <Q>God opens his people's ears to discipline, and commands that they turn from iniquity. If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasure: but if they obey him not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge,</Q> Job xxxvi. 10, 11, 12. So the disobedient, that do not turn from their iniquity, have not this prosperity and pleasure; but die without the knowledge of God; and their ears are shut to this disci∣pline, which God opens to his people.</P>

<P>When I had been about two months in London, I was sent for to my son Rouse's at Kingston, to visit a daughter of his, who at that time lay very sick; but recovered. Whilst I staid there, I had several meetings with friends: and returning by Hammersmith, staid the first-day meeting there, which was large and peaceable. Having visited friends thereabouts. I came back to London again; being very intent upon the business of getting redress for suffering friends. In this and other services I continued at London till the latter end of the eleventh month; save that I went to visit an ancient friend at Bethnal-Green, with whom I tarried three or four days. While I was there, I was much exercised, in the sense of the enemy's working, to draw from the holy way of truth into a false liberty, and so into the
<PB N="346" REF="037441_0862_100D9429F668E4E0"/>world's ways and worships again. And the example of the backsliding Jews coming before me, I was moved to write the following, as a warning to all such:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>YOU may see, when the Jews rebelled against the good Spirit of God, which he gave to instruct them, they forsook him and his law, way, and worship, went a whoring after Balaam's ways, and became like the <Q>wild ass's colt, snuffing up the wind,</Q> Jer. ii. 24. In Jer. iii. see how Judah played the harlot under every green tree, and upon every high mountain; therefore the Lord di∣vorced Judah, as he had divorced Israel when she forsook his way, and followed the ways of the heathen. Though the Lord had fed them to the full, yet they <Q>forsook him, committed adultery, and assembled themselves together in harlots houses,</Q> Jer. v. 7. <Q>And with their whoredom they defiled the land, and committed adultery with stocks and stones.</Q> Jer. iii. 9. Here you may see, when they forsook the living, eternal God, they followed the reli∣gions and worships of other nations, whose gods were made of stocks and stones, which the Jews worshipped, and committed adultery withal. When they forsook the living God, and his way and worship, they forsook the worship at Jerusalem at the temple, and followed the hea∣thens worships in the mountains and fields: So it was called adultery and whoredom, to join with other reli∣gions, and forsake God, Jer. xiii. 27.</P>
<P>And now, if the children of the New Jerusalem that is above would forsake the worship that Christ in his New Testament set up. (which is in Spirit and in truth) and follow the worship of nations, which men have set up; will not they commit adultery with them, in forsaking God's worship, and Christ the new and living way?</P>
<P>In Jer. xliv. ye may see how the children of Judah provoked the Lord against them, by worshipping the works of their own hands, and following the gods of the land of Egypt. In this they committed adultery, forsak∣ing the living God, their husband, and his worship; and there ye may see God's judgments pronounced against them to their destruction. What will become of those that forsake the worship in Spirit and truth, which Christ set up; and worship the works of their own hands in spi∣ritual Egypt, and follow spiritual Egypt's will-worship, which they invented? May not this be called whoredom
<PB N="347" REF="037441_0863_100D942C4D1F38F0"/>in them that forsake Christ, the new and living way, his pure religion, and the worship that he hath set up? And they that forsake the Lord's way and his worship, and fol∣low the world's ways and worships, do not they, whose way they follow, become at last their enemies? as in La∣ment. 1. See how the Jews forsook the Lord's way and worship, and doted on other lovers (the Assyrians, &amp;c.) and with all their idols were defiled; and how they retain∣ed the whoredoms brought from Egypt, and were polluted with the Babylonians bed: read Ezek. xxiii. When they forsook the Lord, his way and worship, and followed the way and worship of the heathen; then it was said, <Q>They went a whoring after others, and committed adultery with them.</Q></P>
<P>Ye may see Ezek. xvi. the state of the Jews was liken∣ed to that of their sister Sodom, which had played the harlot with the Assyrians, committed fornication with the Egyptians, and increased their whoredoms, in following their abominable idols; therefore the Lord carried away the two tribes, that forsook him, into Babylon; see Ezek. xvii. 20. And they that forsake Christ, the new and liv∣ing Way, and the worship of God in Spirit and truth, which Christ set up in his New Testament, go into cap∣tivity in spiritual Babylon.</P>
<P>Hosea ii. you may see how the prophet discovers the whoredoms and idolatry of the Jews who forsook the Lord, and compares them to an harlot. And in chap. iii. ye may see the destruction threatened against the Jews for their impiety and idolatry. In ch. ix. also the distress and captivity of the Jews is threatened for their sins and idolatry; and again they are reproved and threatened for their impiety and idolatry, Hos x. This was for forsak∣ing the Lord and his way, and following the ways of their own inventions, and the ways of the heathen.</P>
<P>Doth not Isaiah say, <Q>That the Lord would visit Tyre, and that she should commit fornication with all the king∣doms upon the face of the earth?</Q> therefore the Lord threatened destruction upon her, ch. xxiii. In ch. lvii. you may see how the Lord reproved the Jews for their whorish idolatry, saying, <Q>Upon an high and losty moun∣tain hast thou set thy bed, even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifices. Thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them, thou lovest their bed where thou sawest it.</Q> This was a joining to the heathen's re∣ligions,
<PB N="348" REF="037441_0864_100D942DE1972AB8"/>altars, and sacrifices, and forsaking the Lord's al∣tar and sacrifices, which he commanded in the law; and therefore that was committing whoredom with the heathen, and a going into their beds from the Living God that made them. And now in the New Testament God hav∣ing "poured his Spirit upon all flesh." that by it all might come to be a <Q>royal priesthood, to offer up spirit∣ual sacrifices to God by Jesus Christ;</Q> all that err from the Spirit of God. and rebel against it, are not like to offer spiritual sacrifices to God; the sacrifice of such God doth not accept, no more than he did that of the heathens or the Jews, who rebelled against his good Spirit that he gave them to instruct them.</P>
<P>You may see in the 17th, 18th, and 19th chapters of the Revelation the punishment of the great whore, Baby∣lon, the mother of harlots, and the victory of the Lamb, and how he calleth God's people out of Babylon; for <Q>in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</Q> There ye may read her judgment and downfal. This whore are they that are whored from the Spirit of God, and so from God. from his holy worship in spirit and truth, from the pure undefiled religion that keeps from the spots of the world, from the new and living way of Christ Jesus; these are whored from the Spirit of God into false religions, ways, and worships, and so have corrupted the earth with her abominations. But her judgment and downfal are seen, over whom Christ hath the victory; and the marri∣age of the Lamb is come, glory to the Lord for ever! And God's pure religion, and pure worship in Spirit and truth Christ hath set up, as it was in the apostles days, Hallelujah.</P>

<P>I soon returned to London, but made no long stay there, my body not being able to bear the closeness of the city long together. While I was in town, besides the usual services of <Q>visiting friends, and taking care about their suf∣ferings to get them eased,</Q> I assisted the friends of the city in distributing certain sums of money, which our friends of Ireland had charitably and very liberally raised, and sent over hither for the relief of their brethren who suffered for the testimony of a good conscience; which monies were distri∣buted
<PB N="349" REF="037441_0865_100D94301D430EF0"/>amongst poor suffering friends in the several counties in proportion, according as we understood their need.</P>
<P>Before I left the city I heard of a great doctor lately come from Poland, whom I invited to my lodging, and had a great deal of discourse with him. After I had informed my∣self by him of such things as I had a desire to know, I wrote a letter to the king of Poland on behalf of friends at Dant∣zick, who had long been under grievous sufferings. A copy whereof follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>TO JOHN the third, king of Poland, great duke of Li∣thuania, Russia, and Prussia, defender of the city of Dantzick, &amp;c.<LB/>
Concerning the innocent and afflicted people in scorn called Quakers, who are now fed with bread and wa∣ter in Bridewell of the aforesaid city, under close con∣finement, where their friends, wives, and children are hardly suffered to come to see them.<LB/>
Oh king!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE magistrates of the city of Dantzick say it is thy order and command that these innocent and afflicted people should suffer such oppression. Now this punish∣ment is inflicted upon them only because they come toge∣ther in the name of Jesus Christ, their Redeemer and Sa∣viour, who died for their sins, and is risen from the dead for their justification, who is their prophet, whom God hath raised up like unto Moses; whom they ought to hear in all things in this day of the gospel and new covenant; who went astray like scattered sheep, but now are returned to the Chief, Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls, 1 Pet. ii. 25. <Q>Who has given his life for his sheep, and they hear his voice and follow him;</Q> who leads them into his "pastures of life," John x.</P>
<P>Now, O king! I understand thou openly prosessest Christianity, and the great and mighty name of Jesus Christ, who is King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom is given all power in heaven and earth, who rules all na∣tions with a rod of iron. Therefore, O king, it seems hard to us, that any who openly confess Christ Jesus (yea the magistrates of Dantzick do the same) should inflict those punishments upon an innocent and harmless people, by reason of their tender consciences only, because they
<PB N="350" REF="037441_0866_100D94326B4B6F60"/>come together to serve and worship the Eternal God, who made them, in Spirit and in truth; which worship Christ Jesus has set up sixteen hundred years ago, as we read in John iv. 23, 24.</P>
<P>I beseech the king that he would consider, whether Christ in the New Testament ever gave such a command to his apostles that they should shut up any in prison, and feed them with bread and water, who were not conforma∣ble in every particular to their religion, faith, and worship? Where did the apostles exercise such things in the true church after Christ's ascension? Is not this the doctrine of Christ and the apostles, that Christ's followers should <Q>love their enemies, and pray for them that hate, persecute, and despitefully use them?</Q> Mat. v.</P>
<P>Is it not a shame to Christendom among the Turks and others, that one Christian should persecute another for the doctrine of faith, worship, and religion? They cannot prove that Christ ever gave them such a command, whom they profess to be their Lord and Master. For Christ says, that his believers and followers should "love one another;" and by this they should be known to be his disciples. And did not Christ reprove those who would have <Q>fire to come down from heaven</Q> to destroy them who would not receive him? Did not he tell them, <Q>they did not know what spirit they were of?</Q> Have all who have per∣secuted men, or taken away their lives because they would not receive their religion, known what spirit they were or are of? Is it not good for all to know by the Spirit of Christ what spirit they are of? The apostle says, Rom. viii. 9. <Q>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his.</Q> And 2 Cor. x. 4. <Q>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, &amp;c. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness,</Q> &amp;c. Thus we see, the fight of the first Christians and their weapons in the days of the apostles were spiritual.</P>
<P>Would not the king and the magistrates of Dantzick think it contrary to their consciences, if they should be forced by the Turk to his religion? Would it not in like manner, seem hard to the magistrates of Dantzick, and contrary to their consciences, if they should be forced to the religion of the king of Poland? or the king of Poland, if he should be compelled to the religion of the magistrates of Dantzick? And if they would not be subject thereunto, that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y should be banished from their wives and families,
<PB N="351" REF="037441_0867_100D9434CE9E1C78"/>and out of their native country, or otherwise be fed with bread and water under strict confinement?</P>
<P>We beseech the king with all Christian humility, and the magistrates of Dantzick, that they would order their proceedings in this matter according to the royal law of God, which is, <Q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them, and to love their neighbour as themselves.</Q> For we have this charity, that we hope and believe the king of Poland and his people, with the ma∣gistrates of Dantzick, own the writings of the New Testa∣ment as well as of the Old; therefore we beseech the king and the magistrates of Dantzick, to take heed that their work of imprisoning an innocent people, for nothing but their meeting together in tenderness of conscience to serve and worship God, their Creator, may not be contrary and opposite to the royal law of God, and to the glorious and everlasting gospel of truth.</P>
<P>We desire the king, in Christian love, earnestly and weightily to consider these things, and to give order to set the innocent prisoners, our friends, called Quakers, at li∣berty from their strict confinement in Dantzick, that they may have freedom to serve and worship the Living God in Spirit and in truth, and go home to their habitations, and follow their trades and calling, to maintain their wives, children and families. And we believe that the king, in doing such a noble, glorious, yea Christian work, will not go unrewarded from the Great God who made him, whom we serve and worship, who has the hearts of kings, and their lives and length of days in his hand.</P>
<P>From him who desires the king and all his ministers may be preserved in the fear of God, and receive his word of wisdom, by which all things were made and created, that by it he may come to order all things to the glory of God, which God has put under his hand; that both he and they may enjoy the comforts and blessings of the Lord in this life, and in that which is to come life eternal, Amen.</P>

After this I went into Enfield, where, and in the coun∣try thereabouts several friends had country-houses, amongst whom I tarried some time visiting and being visited by friends, and having meetings with them. Several things I wrote in this time relating to the service of truth. one whereof was concerning judging; for some, who had de∣parted from the truth, were so afraid of truth's judgment, that they made it much of their business to cry out against judging. Wherefore I wrote a paper, proving by the scrip∣tures of truth, that the church of Christ hath power and abi∣lity to judge those that profess to be of it, not only with respect to outward things relating to this world, but with respect to religious matters also. A copy of which follows:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="tract">
<HEAD>Concerning Judging.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE natural man receiveth not the things of the Spi∣rit of God, for they are foolishness to him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned; but he that is spiritual judgeth all things (mark) all things, yet he himself is judged of no man,</Q> 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15. So the natural man cannot judge of those things he re∣ceives not, for they are foolishness to him; but he is com∣prehended by the spiritual man, and his foolishness, and is judged, though he cannot judge the spiritual man.</P>
<P>"Do not ye judge them that are within?" saith the apos∣tle. This power the church had and hath, <Q>therefore put away from amongst yourselves that wicked person.</Q> Did not this wicked person, think you, profess and plead for liberty for his wickedness, and his freedom, as he was a Christian, who was looked upon as a member of the church?</P>
<P>The apostle saith, <Q>For I verily, as absent in body, yet present in Spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath done this wicked deed,</Q> 1 Cor. v. 3, 12. Here the apostle did judge, though afar off, and set up judgment in the church against false liberty, under what pretence soever it was.</P>
<P>And the apostle saith, <Q>Dare any of you, having a mat∣ter against a brother, go to law before the unjust and not before the saints?</Q> Here the saints, the church, are to judge of things amongst themselves, and not the unjust to judge of their matters. <Q>Do ye not know the saints shall
<PB N="353" REF="037441_0869_100D9438983FFA30"/>judge the world?</Q> So the saints are to judge the unjust, and not the unjust to judge their matters.</P>
<P>And farther the apostle saith, <Q>If the world shall be judged by you (to wit, the saints) are you unworthy to judge the smaller matters amongst you?</Q></P>
<P>It is clear that the saints have a judgment given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ, by his power and Spirit, light and wisdom, to judge the world, and not to carry their matters before the unjust, but to judge of the amongst themselves; and if they carry them before the unjust, they shew their un∣worthiness of the saints judgment.</P>
<P>Again, <Q>Know ye not, that we shall judge the angels? (and angels are spirits) how much more the things which pertain to this life?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If ye then have judgment of things pertaining to this life. set them up to judge who have least esteem in the church,</Q> 1 Cor. iv. 6. Here it is clear the church of Christ has a judgment in the power and Spirit of God, not only to judge in "things that pertain to this life;" but also to judge of things betwixt brethren, without bro∣ther going to law with brother before unbelievers; which was a fault, and to be judged, if they did so.</P>
<P>But all the saints have a judgment to judge angels that kept not their habitations, and the world. Jude <Q>judged the angels that kept not their habitations, their first state.</Q> Did not he judge in divine matters here? He judged the state of Cain, Balaam, and Core, and such Christians as were got into their steps, and were gone as far as they, though they professed themselves Christians? Here again he judged in divine matters, and of their states and beings, who stood in the divine principle, and who were fallen from it.</P>
<P>The apostle saith, <Q>Try the spirits, and believe not every spirit,</Q> 1 John 4. Here again was a judgment in divine matters; and he judged such as went out from them, which whilst they were with them they had sight of things and openings, but when they went from them, they went from the anointing; therefore he exhorts the saints to keep to the anointing. Such as went from them that had the anointing, came to be the seducers and false prophets that went into the world.</P>
<P>John had a judgment to try sacrifices, and distinguish∣ed Cain's from Abel's, and by the Spirit of God knew which God accepted, and which he did not accept, 1 John
<PB N="354" REF="037441_0870_100D943BB0A87778"/>iii. 1.2. Paul judged and tried such messengers and apos∣tles, and transformers of themselves like to the apostles of Christ, and would have the church to try such, and have the same judgment as he had, 2 Cor. xi.</P>
<P>Peter judged Ananias and Sapphira, and the thoughts of Simon Magus, who would have been a worker of mira∣cles for money. Was not all this judgment in divine mat∣ters? The apostle Paul judged the preachers of circumci∣sion both in the Romans and Galatians. For it was the faith and liberty of those preachers to preach up circumcision, though it was a wrong faith. Did not the apostle here again judge in divine matters?</P>
<P>James judged in matters of faith, and manifested the liv∣ing faith from the dead one. He also judged in matters of religion, the vain religion from the pure religion, and dis∣tinguished them.</P>
<P>Paul judged of the <Q>false brethren that would spy out the liberty of the true, to whom he would give no place by fubjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gos∣pel might continue with the saints,</Q> Gal. ii. Did not the apostle here judge in divine matters? And he judged concerning the matters of the gospel, when some came to pervert them with another gospel, and said, <Q>The gospel which I received is not of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ,</Q> Gal. i. 12. So here was a judgment to distinguish the gospel of Christ from all other gospels which were accursed, which after man are received of man, and taught of man, and not by the revelation of Jesus Christ, Gal. i. And he had judg∣ment to know, <Q>Who made the gospel chargeable, and who kept it without charge.</Q></P>
<P>He set up a judgment in the church, that the believers should not be unequally yoked, and to see when men had a communion in the light, and when they had it in dark∣ness, when with Christ and when with Baal, with the believer and unbeliever, with the temple of God and with Idols, as in 2 Cor. 6. Did he not set up a clear judg∣ment here in divine matters in the church?</P>
<P>And the apostle judged such libertines through their knowledge that could sit at meat in the idol-temple, which caused the weak brother to perish, through his knowledge and liberty, for whom Christ died. These, it is like, did profess it was their faith and their liberty, yet did not keep
<PB N="355" REF="037441_0871_100D943DDBC07E00"/>in the unity of the true faith, but went astray to destroy it, 1 Cor. viii.</P>
<P>Peter gives judgment upon the angels that sinned and were cast down into hell, of the state of the old world, and of Sodom, and the state of the false prophets then amongst them, that could speak great swelling words of vanity, and whilst they promised them liberty were themselves the ser∣vants of corruption. Had not Peter here a judgment in divine matters? These were such, whose work was to bring into bondage, being like the dog and sow that were washed; which shews that they had been washed, but were turned into the mire again. The apostle Paul had a judg∣ment upon such with their fair words and men's wisdom, that deceived the hearts of the simple, and upon such as <Q>served not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies, and were enemies to the cross of Christ.</Q> He had a judg∣ment and discerning who lived in the cross of Christ, and who did not, and exhorted all to live in the cross of Christ, the righteous power of God, that slew all deceit and the deeds of the old man; agreeable to Christ's words. <Q>He that will be my disciple, must take up his cross, and fol∣low me.</Q> Was not here a judgment again in divine matters, of such as walked in the divine power, and such as did not?</P>
<P>Christ sets up a judgment in his seven churches, and commends them that did keep in his judgment, and had tried them which said, "They were apostles," who might pretend they were sent of God and Christ, and were not; but the Church of Christ had found them liars. Christ commended this judgment of the church of Ephesus, be∣cause they had <Q>not borne with them that were evil, but had tried those false apostles;</Q> and Christ commends this church, for that they had <Q>hated the deeds of the Nico∣laitans, which he also bated;</Q> and had not these Nicolai∣tans sprung from Nicholas, one of the deacons? and were not those become a sect of Christians? Though they might talk and preach of Christ, yet Christ hated their doctrine.</P>
<P>Christ saith to the Church of Smyrna, <Q>I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not; but are of the synagogue of Satan.</Q> So the Church is to have a judgment upon these blasphemers, and are to dis∣tinguish the Jews in the Spirit from such as are not, but of the synagogue of Satan.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="037441_0872_100D943F6E029468"/>
The Church in Pergamos Christ had a "few things against, because," said he, "thou hast there them that hold the doctrines of Balaam, &amp;c. And also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate." These that held the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, were got into the church, and might look upon themselves to be high Christians, and take great liberty to go into Balaam's and Nicholas's doctrine, which was hated by Christ; but the church was to keep a spirit∣ual and divine judgment upon the heads of all these.</P>
<P>To the church of Thyatira, saith Christ, <Q>I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest the woman Je∣zebel to teach, which seduces my people,</Q> &amp;c. Here was a suffering which should have been a judgment by Christ's Spirit upon that Jezebel which was erred from his Spirit, and so from Christ. Such as these were high preachers. Is not the church to beware of suffering such now, lest she should come under the reproof of Christ for not passing judgment against the false teacher and seducer?</P>
<P>The church of Sardis "had a name to live, but was dead, and her works were not found perfect before God." There is a judgment to be set up in the church, to judge all imperfect works, and such as would have a name, but not the nature; a name to live yet are dead. The living of every member of the true church must be in Christ their life. These living members live to his name. This church had a few names, <Q>who had not desiled their garments, that did walk in white;</Q> but such as have a name to live but are dead, whilst they are in a dead state cannot walk in white, nor judge in divine matters. "Behold," said Christ, <Q>I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, but are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and to worship before my feet.</Q></P>
<P>And to the church of Laodicea, that was "neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm; I would thou wert either hot or cold: I will spew thee out of my mouth, because thou saidst thou wast rich, and wanted nothing;" when they were "wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked." This was for want of living in the power and Spirit of Christ. These could talk of high experiences and great enjoyments, but were naked, miserable, and blind; so lived not in the power, Spirit, light, and righteousness of Christ, by which they might be clothed, and have the eternal riches. So the church of Christ had a spiritual
<PB N="357" REF="037441_0873_100D9441C683FFD0"/>judgment given to them that are faithful in his power and Spirit and light, to judge of temporal things and the things of this life, and to judge of eternal and divine things and states, and of angels and wicked men, and such as go from truth, and of the states of election and reprobation, yea and of the devils who are out of truth; these being in Christ Jesus who is the First and Last, from whom they have the eternal judgment, to judge eternal, spiritual, and divine things; and in this word of power and wisdom, by which all things were made and are upheld, to order all things to God's glory, and to judge of all things in righteousness.</P>
<P>The apostle judged, and set up a judgment in the church, of gifts, of prophecies, of mysteries of faith, and of giving the body to be burned, and of giving goods to the poor, and of speaking with tongues of men and angels; that yet, if they had not love, all this was nothing, but as a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. Therefore they are to be tried by the fruits of the good Spirit, which is love. The apostle not only judged himself in divine matters, but set up a judgment in the church in those spi∣ritual and divine matters.</P>
<P>The apostle James judges of fountains and of fig-trees, of the wisdom below, and of the wisdom from above. and the fruits of both, James iii. And Paul judged in divine matters, when he said, <Q>The Spirit spoke expressly, that in the latter times some should depart from the faith,</Q> 1 Tim. iv. He judged in divine matters, when he judged all those teachers that were high-minded, and had got the form of godliness, but denied the power, and termed them like Jannes and Jamores, which withstood Moses coming out of outward Egypt, as these with their form of godli∣ness oppose Christ and his power that brings them out of spiritual Egypt now. Was not he a judge here in divine matters, who judged such as had gotten the form of godli∣ness but denied the divine power? 2 Tim. iii.</P>
<P>When the apostle Paul said, "The priesthood of Aaron was changed, and the law was changed, and the com∣mandment disannulled, that gave them their tithes," did not he judge in divine and spiritual matters? and was not the law spiritual, which served till the Seed came?</P>
<P>Did not the apostle judge in divine and spiritual mat∣ters in the sixth of the Hebrews, where he saith, <Q>Let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of
<PB N="358" REF="037441_0874_100D9443E3BB7218"/>repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, and of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judg∣ment: and this will we do, if God permit,</Q> &amp;c. and does not the apostle judge here, <Q>That it was impossible for those who were once enlightened, and tasted of the hea∣venly gift, and were partakers of the holy Ghost, and had tasted of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame?</Q> Heb. vi. Were not these spiritual, eternal, and divine matters and states that the apostle judged of? and have not the saints the same judgment given unto them in the same spirit? Have not the apostles and the church a spiritual judgment to judge of prophets, mysteries, faith, apostles, angels, world, and the devil? And is not this judgment given them of God in divine matters, besides the judgment giv∣en them in matters pertaining unto this life?</P>
<P>And had not they judgment to discern the true gospel from the false? and all such as had a profession of the form, and did not live in the power? and such as spoke of the things of God, in the words that man's wisdom did teach? which things of God were not to be spoken in the wisdom which man's words taught; but in the word which the Holy Ghost taught. Therefore did not the apostle exhort to know the power, and that their faith might stand in the power of God? that the kingdom of God stands not in word, but in power?</P>
<P>Had not all the prophets a judgment to judge in divine matters? as Jeremiah, when he judged the prophets; and Ezekiel judged all such as came with a pretence of the Word of the Lord, using their tongues, and saying, <Q>Thus saith the Lord; when the Lord never spoke unto them.</Q> Jeremiah xxiii. Ezekiel xiii. and many other places might be instanced. Did he not judge Hananiah, who prophesied falsely? and did not this Hananiah pre∣tend to speak the word of the Lord to the priests and people? Jeremiah xxviii.</P>
<P>Did not Isaiah judge in divine matters, when he judged the watchmen and the shepherds? Isa. lvi. Did not Mi∣cah judge in divine and spiritual matters, when he said he <Q>was full of the power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment?</Q> Did not he judge of priests, prophets, and
<PB N="359" REF="037441_0875_100D9445ED6D8828"/>judges, though they would lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord amongst us, and no evil can come unto us; yet did not he let them see their states and conditions, and "divided the precious from the vile?" Mich. iii. And so the rest of the prophets. You may see they judged for God in his divine matters, <Q>who served him, and who served him not; who lived in truth, and who not;</Q> and likewise the apostles. And this divine, spiritual, heavenly judgment was given of God to his holy men and women.</P>
<P>They that judge in God's divine matters, must live in his divine Spirit, power, and light now, as they did then; which spiritual and divine judgment Christ has given to his Church, the living stones, and living members, that make up his spiritual household; to try Jews, apostles, and prophets; to try faiths and religions, trees and fruits, shepherds and teachers, and to try spirits. So the living members have a living divine judgment in the church of Christ, which he is the Head of, the judge of all.</P>
<P>Nay, the church has a power given them, which is far∣ther than a judgment: for what they <Q>bind on earth, is bound in heaven by the power of God;</Q> and what they "loose on earth is loosed in heaven by the power of God." This power has Christ given to his living members, the church.</P>

<P>I returned to London in the first month 1686, and set myself with all diligence to look after friends sufferings, which we had now some hopes of getting relief from. The sessions came on in the second month at Hicks's Hall, where many friends had appeals to be tried; with whom I was from day to day to advise, and see that no opportunity was slipt, nor advantage lost: and they generally succeeded well. Soon after, the king was pleased, upon our often laying our sufferings before him, <Q>To give order for the releasing all that were imprisoned for conscience-sake; which were in his power to discharge.</Q> Whereby the pri∣son-doors were opened, and many hundreds of friends, some of whom had been long in prison, were set at liberty. Some of them, who had many years been restrained in bonds, came up to the yearly meeting, which was in the third month this year. This caused great joy to friends, to see
<PB N="360" REF="037441_0876_100D9447F802E1E8"/>our ancient, faithful brethren again at liberty in the Lord's work, after their long confinement. And indeed a precious meeting we had; the refreshing presence of the Lord ap∣pearing plentifully with us and amongst us. After the meeting I was moved to write a few lines, to be sent amongst friends; the tenor whereof was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY love is to you all in the holy Seed Christ Jesus, that bruises the serpent's head, and destroys the de∣vil and his works; and who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him. Let every one's faith stand in him, and in his power, who is the author and finisher of your faith. To you who have been partakers of his power, and are sensible of it in this day of his power, which is over darkness and its power; by whose power the hearts of the king and rulers have been opened; and by which your out∣ward prison-doors have been set open for your liberty. My desires are, that all may be preserved in humility and thankfulness, in the sense of the mercies of the Lord; and live in the peaceable truth that is over all: that ye may answer God's grace, and his light and Spirit in all; in a righteous, godly life and conversation. Let none be lift∣ed up by their outward liberty, neither let any be cast down by suffering for Christ's sake; but all live in the seed (which is as wheat) which is not shaken nor blown away by the winds and storms, as the chaff is. Which Seed of life none below can make higher or lower: for the children of the Seed are the children of the everlasting, unchangeable kingdom of Christ and God. In Christ Jesus, whom God hath given you for a sanctuary. God Almighty keep you, in whom ye have life everlasting, and wisdom from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits; that all may be exercised in it, and may practise this wis∣dom in holy lives and conversations; that this wisdom may be justified of all her children, and they exercised and preserved in it in this day of the power of Christ; in which all his people are made a willing people, to serve and worship God in righteousness and holiness, in the Spi∣rit and truth.</P>
<P>Let none abuse the power of the Lord, nor grieve his Spirit, by which you are sealed and kept to the day of sal∣vation and redemption; but always exercise yourselves to
<PB N="361" REF="037441_0877_100D944A03333E90"/>have a <Q>good conscience void of offence towards God and towards all men;</Q> being exercised in holiness, godliness, and righteousness, in the truth, and in the love of it. All study to be approved unto God in innocency, virtue, simplicity, and faithfulness, labouring and studying to be quiet in the will of God. <Q>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giv∣ing thanks to God the Father by him:</Q> That he, who is over all, may have the praise for all his mercies and bles∣sings, with which he hath refreshed his people, and by his eternal arm and power hath kept and preserved them to this day. Glory to his name over all forever, Amen! Christ has called you by his grace into one body, to him the holy head; therefore live in charity, and in the love of God, which is the bond of perfectness in his body; which love edifies the body of Christ: which body and all its members are knit together, and increased with the increase of God, from whom they receive nourishment. For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, and have been made all to drink into one Spirit; in which Spirit the body and all its members have fellowship with Christ the head, and one with another. The unity of this holy Spirit is the bond of peace of all the living members of Christ Jesus, of which he is the spiritual head, rock, and foundation. In the midst of his church of living members Christ exercises his spiritual prophetical office, to open to them the mysteries of his kingdom. He is a spiritual bishop to oversee them, that they do not go astray from the living God that made them; a shepherd that feeds them with bread and water of life from heaven, and none is able to pluck his sheep out of his hands. He is a priest that died for them, sanctifieth them, and presents them to God, who ruleth in their hearts by the divine faith, which he is the author and finisher of. His living members praise God through Jesus Christ, in whom they have life and salvation, who reconciles them to God, that they can say they have <Q>peace with God through Jesus Christ;</Q> and so praise God through him that was dead and is alive, reigns over all, and liveth for everrnore, blessed for ever, Hallelujah, Amen!</P>
<P>Greet one another with an holy kiss of charity. Love or charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. It envieth not, vaunteth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>self, nor is puffed up, nor doth it behave itself un∣seemly.
<PB N="362" REF="037441_0878_100D944C1F0EA348"/>It rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth. Charity is not easily provoked, and thinks no evil, but suffereth long and is kind. Charity never faileth. I say, greet one another with this holy kiss of charity, and peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus, your life and salvation.</P>

<P>I remained most part of this year it London, save that sometimes I got to Bethnal-green for a night or two, some∣times as far as Enfield and thereabouts amongst friends, and once or twice to Chiswich, where an ancient friend had set up a school for the educating of friends children; in all which places I found service for the Lord. At London I spent my time amongst friends, either in publick meetings, as the Lord drew me, or visiting such as were not well, and in looking after the sufferings of friends. For though many were released out of prison, yet some remained prisoners still for tithes, &amp;c. and sufferings of several sorts lay heavy on friends in many places. Yet inasmuch as many who had been prisoners were now set at liberty; I felt a concern upon me that none might look too much at man, but might eye the Lord therein, from whom deliverance comes. Where∣fore I wrote an epistle to friends, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord by his eternal power hath disposed the heart of the king to open the prison-doors, by which about fifteen or sixteen hundred are set at liberty, and hath given a check to the informers, so that in many places our meetings are pretty quiet. My desires are, that both liberty and sufferings may be sanctified to his peo∣ple, that friends may prize the mercies of the Lord in all things and to him be thankful, who stilleth the raging waves of the sea, allayeth the storms and tempests, and maketh a calm. Therefore it is good to trust in the Lord, and cast your care upon him who careth for you. For when ye were in gaols and prisons the Lord did by his eternal arm and power uphold you, and sanctified them to you; unto some he made them as a sanctuary and tried his people as in a furnace of affliction, both in pri∣sons and spoiling of goods. In all this the Lord wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>with
<PB N="363" REF="037441_0879_100D944E353A4FF0"/>his people, and taught them to know that <Q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof;</Q> and that he was in all places, "who crowneth the year with his goodness," Psal. lxv. Therefore let all God's people be diligent, and careful to keep the camp of God holy, pure, and clean, and to serve God and Christ, and one another in the glorious, peaceable gospel of life and salvation; which glory shines over God's camp, and his great Prophet, Bi∣shop and Shepherd is among, or in the midst of them, exercising his heavenly offices in them; so that you his people may rejoice in Christ Jesus, through whom you have peace with God. For he that destroyeth the devil and his works, and bruises the serpent's head, is all God's people's heavenly foundation and rock to build upon; which was the holy prophets and apostles rock in days past, and is now the rock of our age; which rock, the foundation of God, standeth sure. Upon this the <Q>Lord God establish all his people,</Q> Amen.</P>

<P>Divers other epistles and papers I wrote this year, whereof one was by way of exhortation to <Q>friends to keep in unity in the truth, in which there is no division nor separation:</Q> thus,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN whom ye have all peace and life, in whom there is no division, schism, rent, strife, nor separation: for Christ is not divided, and there can be no separation in the truth, nor in the light, grace, faith, and Holy Ghost, but unity, fellowship, and communion. For the devil was the first that went out of the truth, separated from it, and tempted man and woman to disobey God, and to go from the truth into a false liberty, to do that which God forbad. So it is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pent now that leads men and women into a false libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, even the God of the world, from which man and woman must be separated by the truth, that Christ the truth may make them free, and then they are free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>deed. Then they are to stand fast in that liberty in which Christ hath made them free, and in him there is no division, schism, rent, nor separation; but peace, life, and
<PB N="364" REF="037441_0880_100D945067312078"/>reconciliation to God and to one another. So in Christ male and female are all one; for whether they be male or female, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, they are all one in Christ. And there can be no schism, rent, or division in him, nor in the worship of God in his holy Spirit and truth, nor in the pure and undefiled religion that keeps from the spots of the world, nor in the love of God that beareth and endureth all things, nor in the word of God's grace, for it is pure and endureth for ever. Many, you see, have lost the word of patience, and the word of wis∣dom, that is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be in∣treated. Then they run into the wisdom that is below, that is "earthly, sensual, and devilish," and very uneasy to be intreated. They go from the love of God that beareth all things, endureth all things, thinks no evil, and doth not behave itself unseemly; them they cannot bear, but grow brittle, are easily provoked, run into unseemly things, and are in that, that vaunteth itself, are puffed up, rash, heady, high-minded, and fierce, and become as sound∣ing brass or a tinkling cymbal; but this is contrary to the nature of the love of God. Therefore, dear friends and bre∣thren, dwell in the love of God; for those who dwell in love dwell in God, and God in them. Keep in the word of wis∣dom, that is gentle, pure, and peaceable: and in the word of patience that endureth and beareth all things; which word of patience the devil, and the world, and all his in∣struments can never wear out: it will wear them all out; for it was before they were, and will be when they are gone, the pure, holy word of God, by which all God's children are born again, and feed on the milk thereof, and live and grow by it. My desires are, that ye may all be of one heart, mind, soul, and spirit in Christ Jesus, Amen.</P>

<P>ALL you that are gathered in his holy name know that your meetings for worship, your quarterly meetings, monthly meetings, women's meetings, and yearly meet∣ings, are set up by the power and Spirit of the Lord God, and witnessed by his Spirit and power in your hearts: and by the Spirit and power of the Lord God they are esta∣blished to you, and in the power and Spirit of the Lord God you are established in them. The Lord God hath with his Spirit sealed to you that your meetings are of his ordering and gathering, and he hath owned them by ho∣nouring you with his blessed presence in them; and you have had great experience of his furnishing you with wis∣dom, life, and power, and heavenly riches from his trea∣sure and fountain by which many thanks and praises have been returned in your meetings to his holy, glorious name. He hath sealed your meetings by his Spirit to you, and that your gathering together hath been by the Lord, to Christ his Son, and in his name, and not by man. So the Lord hath the glory and praise of them and in them, who hath upheld you and them by the arm of his power against all opposers and backsliders and their slan∣derous books and tongues. For the Lord's power and seed doth reign over them all, in which he doth preserve his sons and daughters to his glory, by his eternal arm and power, in his work and service, as a willing people in the day of his power, without being weary or fainting, but strong in the Lord, and valiant for his glorious name and precious truth, and his pure religion; that ye may serve the Lord in Christ Jesus, your rock and foundation, in your age and generation, Amen.</P>

<P>A little after it came upon me to write something con∣cerning the state of the church and the true members there∣of; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Concerning the church of Christ being clothed with the sun and having the moon under her feet.</P>
<P>THEY are living members, living stones, built up a spiritual household, the children of the promise, and
<PB N="366" REF="037441_0882_100D9454D97885E8"/>of the seed and flesh of Christ; as the apostle saith, <Q>flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone.</Q> They are the good seed, the children of the everlasting kingdom written in heaven, who have put on the Lord Jesus Christ. They sit together in heavenly places in Christ, are clothed with the Sun of righteousness, Christ Jesus, and have the moon under their feet, Revel. xii. So all changeable things that are in the world, all changeable religions changeable worships, changeable ways, fellowships, churches, and teachers in the world, are as the moon; for the moon changes, but the sun doth not change. The Sun of righteousness never changeth, or sets, nor goes down; but all the ways, religions, worships, fellowships of the world, and the teachers thereof, change like the moon. But the true church, which Christ is the head of, which is in God the Father, and is called "the pillar and ground of truth," whose conversation is in heaven; this church is clothed with the Sun, Christ Jesus her head, who doth not change, and hath all changeable things under her feet. These are the living members, born again of the immortal seed by the word of God, who feed upon the immortal milk, and live and grow by it. Such are the new creatures in Christ Jesus, who makes all things new, and sees the old things pass away. His church, his members, which are cloth∣ed with the sun, their worship is in the Spirit and in the truth, which doth not change, which truth the devil, the foul, unclean spirit, is out of, and cannot get into this worship in Spirit and truth. Their religion is pure and undefiled before God, that keeps from the spots of the world, and their way is the new and living way, Christ Jesus. So the church of Christ, that is clothed with the Sun, that hath the moon and all changeable religions and ways under her feet, hath an unchangeable worship, reli∣gion and way, an unchangeable rock and foundation, Christ Jesus, an unchangeable high priest, and so are children of the New Testament, and in the everlasting co∣venant of light and life.</P>
<P>All that prosess the scriptures both of the New and Old Testament, and are not in Christ Jesus, the apostle tells them they are "reprobates if Christ be not in them." These that are not in Christ cannot be clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, that never changes. They are under the changeable moon in the world, in the changeable things, the changeable religions, ways, wor∣ships,
<PB N="367" REF="037441_0883_100D945817677098"/>teachers, rocks, and foundations. But Christ, the Son of God and Sun of righteousness, doth not change; in whom his people are gathered, and sit together in hea∣venly places in him, clothed with Christ Jesus, the Sun, who is the mountain that filleth the whole earth with his divine power and light. So all his people see him and feel him both by sea and land. He is in all places of the earth felt and seen of all his. He saith to the outward professors, the Jews, <Q>I am from above, ye are from be∣low, ye are of this world.</Q> So their religions, worships, ways, teachers, faiths, beliefs, and creeds, are made by men, and are below, of this world that changeth like the moon. You may see their religions, ways, worships, and teachers, are all changeable like the moon; but Christ, the Sun, with which the church is clothed, doth not change, nor his church; for they are spiritually-minded, and their way, worship, and religion is spiritual, from Christ, who is from above and not of this world. Christ hath redeem∣ed you from this world, their changeable rudiments and elements, and old things, and their changeable teachers, and from their changeable faiths and beliefs. For Christ is the Author and Finisher of his church's faith, who saith, <Q>Believe in the Light, that ye may become children of the Light.</Q> And it is given them not only to believe, but to suffer for his name. So this faith and belief is above all faiths and beliefs, which change like the moon. God's people are an holy nation, a peculiar people, a spiritual household, and royal priesthood, offering up spiritual sa∣crifice to God by Jesus Christ, and are zealous of righte∣ousness, godly, good works, and their zeal is for that which is of God against the evil which is not of God. Christ took upon him the seed of Abraham, he doth not say the corrupt seed of the Gentiles; so according to the flesh he was of the holy seed of Abraham and David, and his holy body and blood was an offering and a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, as a lamb without blemish, whose flesh saw no corruption. By the one offering of himself in the New Testament or New Covenant, he has put an end to all the offering and sacrifices amongst the Jews in the Old Testament. Christ, the holy Seed, was crucified, dead, and buried according to the flesh, and raised again the third day, and his flesh saw no corruption. Though he was crucified in the flesh, yet quickened again by the Spirit and is alive, and liveth for evermore, and hath all
<PB N="368" REF="037441_0884_100D9459A8FBF568"/>power in heaven and earth given to him, and reigneth over all, and is the One Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Christ Jesus. Christ said, <Q>He gave his flesh for the life of the world;</Q> and the apostle saith, <Q>his flesh saw no corruption;</Q> so that which saw no corruption he gave for the life of the corrupt world to bring them out of corruption. Christ said again, <Q>He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; for my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</Q> He that eats not his flesh and drinks not his blood, which is the life of the flesh, hath not eter∣nal life. As the apostle saith, "All died in Adam;" then all are dead. Now all coming spiritually to eat the flesh of Christ, the second Adam, and drink his blood, his blood and flesh gives all the dead in Adam life, and quick∣ens them out of their sins and trespasses in which they were dead; so they come to fit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, and are living members of the church of Christ that he is the head of, and are clothed with the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God, that never changes, and have the changeable moon under their feet, and all changeable worldly things, inventions, and works of men's hands. These see the people how they change from one worship to another, from one religion to another, from one way to another, and one church to another, yet their hearts are not changed. The letter of the scripture is read by the Christians like the Jews, but the mystery is hid; they have the sheep's clothing, the outside, but are in∣wardly ravened from the Spirit, which should bring them into the Lamb's and Sheep's nature. The scripture saith, "All the uncircumcised must go down into the pit;" there∣fore all must be circumcised with the Spirit of God, which puts off the body of death and sins of the flesh, that came into man and woman by their disobedience and transgres∣sing God's commands. I say, all must be circumcised with the Spirit, which puts off the body of death and sins of the flesh, before they come up into Christ, their Rest, that never fell, and be clothed with him the Sun of righte∣ousness.</P>

<P>Towards the latter end of this year I went to my sou Rouse's near Kingslon. While I was there I wrote a paper
<PB N="369" REF="037441_0885_100D945C10B00C88"/>concerning the 'falling away,' foretold by the apostle Paul, 2 Thess. ii. 3. as followeth:</P>

<P>THE apostle saith that there must be "a falling away" first before the wicked one, and man of sin, the son of perdition, be revealed, which betrayeth Christ within, as the son of perdition betrayed Christ without; and they that betray Christ within crucify to themselves Christ afresh, and put him to open shame. Before the apostles deceased, this man of sin and son of perdition was reveal∣ed; for they saw antichrist come, the false prophets, false apostles, and deceivers come, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. They saw the wolves dressed in the sheep's clothing, and such as went in Cain's, Corah's, and Balaam's way, and Jezebel's, and the whore of Babylon, the whore of confusion, the mother of harlots, and such as were enemies to the cross of Christ, that serv∣ed not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies. These Christ saw should come, and said, <Q>If it were possible they should deceive the elect,</Q> and commanded his fol∣lowers not to go after them. The apostle said, <Q>Turn away from such,</Q> and Christ and his apostles warned the church of Christ of such. In this day of Christ and his gospel, after the long night of apostacy from the light, grace, truth, life, and Spirit of Christ Jesus, the son of perdition, the wicked one, the man of sin is revealed again, and the inwardly ravening wolves in sheep's clothing, and the spirit of Cain, Corah, Balaam, Jezebel, the antichrists, false prophets, and false apostles, and such as are enemies to the cross of Christ, who serve not the Lord Jesus, but their own bellies, and crucify Christ to themselves, and put him to open shame. This spirit have we seen in this gospel-day of Christ; but Christ will consume them with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy them with the bright∣ness of his coming. But God's people, whom he hath chosen unto salvation in Christ from the beginning, through the sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth, stand steadfast in Christ Jesus, and are thankful to God by and through his Son, their rock and salvation, their happiness, and eternal inheritance.</P>
<P>The apostle saith, <Q>Ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your Souls.</Q> So when people are returned to Christ, their Shepherd, they know his voice and follow him, and are
<PB N="370" REF="037441_0886_100D945E357B8B28"/>returned to the Bishop of their Souls; then they believe in him and receive wisdom and understanding from him who is from above, heavenly and spiritual. Then they act like spiritual holy men and women, and come to be members of the Church of Christ. Then a spiritual care cometh upon the elders in Christ, that all the members walk in Christ, in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth, that they may adorn the confession and profession of Christ, and see that all walk in the order of the holy Spirit, and the everlasting gospel of peace, life, and salvation. This order keeps out of confusion; for the gospel of peace, the power of God, was before confusion was. All the heirs of the gospel are heirs of its order, and are in this gospel which brings life and immortality to light in them, by which all men and women may see their work and service in it, to look after the poor widows and fatherless, to see that nothing be lacking, and that all honour the Lord in their lives and conversations.</P>
<P>When the whole house of Israel were in their graves and sepulchres, and were called "the scattered, dry bones," yet they could speak, and say <Q>their bones were dry, their hope was lost. or they were without hope, and they were cut off.</Q> They were alive outwardly, and could speak outwardly. So that which is called Christendom may very well be called "the scattered dry bones," and be said to be in their graves and sepulchres, dead from the hea∣venly breath of life, the Spirit and word of life, that ga∣thereth to God. Though they can speak, and are alive outwardly, yet they remain in the congregations or churches of the dead, that want the virtue of life. For the Jews, whom God poured his Spirit upon and gave them his law, when they rebelled against the Spirit of God. and turned from God and his law, they came to be dry scattered bones, and were turned into their graves and sepulchres. So Christendom that is turned from the grace, truth, and light of Christ, and the Spirit that God poureth upon all flesh, they are become the scattered dry bones, are in their graves and sepulchres, and are the congrega∣tions or churches of the dead, though they can speak and are alive outwardly.</P>
<P>Christ saith, <Q>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. He gave his flesh for the life of the world.</Q> And he saith, <Q>I am the resurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, and
<PB N="371" REF="037441_0887_100D9460D7B127B0"/>the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</Q> Christ is the quickening Spirit. All being dead in Adam are to be quickened and made alive by Christ, the second Adam. And when they are quickened and made alive by him, they meet together in the name of Jesus Christ their Saviour, who died for their sins and is risen for their jus∣tification, and so was dead and is alive, and liveth for evermore. All whom he hath quickened and made alive (even all the living) meet in the name of Jesus who is alive, and he their living Prophet, Shepherd, and Bishop is in the midst of them, and is their living Rock and Foundation, and a living Mediator between them and the living God. So the living praise the living God through Jesus Christ, through whom they have peace with God. All the living have rest in Christ their life, he is their sanctification, their righteousness, their treasure of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, which is spiritual and hea∣venly. He is the spiritual tree and root, which all the believers in the light, the life in Christ, that pass from the death in Adam to the life in Christ, and overcome the world, and are born of God, are grafted into Christ, the heavenly tree, which beareth all the spiritual branches or grafts. These meet in his name, are gathered in him, and sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, their Life, who hath quickened and made them alive. So all the living worship the living God in his holy Spirit and truth, in which they live and walk. Into this worship the soul, unclean spirit, the devil, cannot get; for the holy Spirit and truth is over him, and he is out of it. This is the standing worship which Christ set up in his new covenant. And they that are quickened by Christ are the living stones, living members, and spiritual household and church, or congregation of Christ, who is the living head and husband. They that are made alive by Christ are a living church, have a living head, and are come from the congregations or churches of the dead in Adam, where death and destruction talk of God, and of his prophets and apostles, in their wisdom that is below, earthly, and devilish, in the knowledge that is brutish, and in the un∣derstanding that comes to nought. For what they know is natural, by their natural tongues, arts, and sciences, in which they corrupt themselves. This is the state of the
<PB N="372" REF="037441_0888_100D9462695B8640"/>dead in Adam; but the quickened, that are made alive by Christ, discern between the living and the dead.</P>

<P>While I was at Kingston, I wrote another paper, shew∣ing, <Q>That the Lord in all ages called the righteous from amongst the wicked, before he destroyed them;</Q> after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>NOAH and his family were called into the ark, before the old world was destroyed with the flood. And all the faithful generation, that lived before, were taken away, and died in the faith, before that flood of destruction came upon the wicked old world.</P>
<P>The Lord did call Lot out of Sodom, before he did destroy and consume it, and the wicked there.</P>
<P>Christ said; <Q>It cannot be, that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem;</Q> and he said; <Q>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings! but ye would not,</Q> Luke xiii. 33, 34. And he said to the Jews; "Therefore also said the wisdom of God, <Q>I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute; that the blood of all the pro∣phets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished be∣tween the altar and the temple. Verily, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation,</Q> Luke xi. 49, 50, 51. And he said to the Jews, <Q>Behold, your houses shall be left unto you desolate,</Q> Matth. xxiii. 34, &amp;c. Christ told his disciples, that the temple at Jerusalem should be thrown down, and there should not be one stone left upon another, that should not be thrown down, Matth. xxiv. 2. Also, that he must go to Jerusalem, and <Q>suffer many things of the Jews, elders, and chief priests, and be killed, and raised again the third day,</Q> Matth. xvi. 21. And Christ said, <Q>When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know, the desolation there∣of is nigh.</Q> He foretold, that the Jews should fall by the edge of the sword, and should be led away <Q>captive into
<PB N="373" REF="037441_0889_100D9464039F2B78"/>all nations; and Jerusalem should be trodden down of the Gentiles,</Q> Luke xxi. 20, 24. Here you may see how Jerusalem was often warned by Christ, and how often he would have "gathered them, but they would not," be∣fore they were scattered over or into all nations, their hou∣ses left desolate, and their temple and Jerusalem besieged with armies, destroyed, and thrown down. And though the disciples and apostles of Christ did meet, with the el∣ders and church at Jerusalem, after Christ was risen, yet Eusebius reporteth in his Ecclesiastical History, that the Christians at Jerusalem had a vision, or a revelation to de∣part out of Jerusalem. Being forewarned also by Christ, that <Q>when they should see Jerusalem compassed with ar∣mies, its desolation was nigh; and that the temple should be thrown down, and not one stone left upon another;</Q> it is said, the Christians did depart out of bloody Jerusalem, before it and the temple were destroyed by Titus the em∣peror, who besieged it with his armies. He was of the Gentiles, and destroyed the temple and Jerusalem, as Christ had forespoken to his disciples, because of the wick∣edness of the Jews, and the innocent blood that they had shed in it. So the Lord called his people out of bloody Jerusalem, before he destroyed it. And it is said, Ti∣tus destroyed the temple and Jerusalem about two-and-for∣ty years after Christ was crucified and risen again, and that with so great a destruction, that the Jews never did build again the city of Jerusalem, nor the temple (as Sodom was never built again, nor the cities of the old world). But the Jews for above these thousand years have been, and are a scattered people in all nations to this day; and Christ (whom they crucified) and his doctrine is preached, and set over them: and the Gentiles, whom they hated, have received and do receive him and his doctrine, and praise God for it through Jesus Christ, Amen.</P>
<P>God called his people out of Egypt, after he had pour∣ed out his ten plagues upon the Egyptians; when he had destroyed the first-born of Egypt, then the Lord brought his people out of Egypt. And after the Lord had clearly brought his people out, he destroyed Pharaoh, with all his hos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and chariots.</P>
<P>John saith, he heard a voice, saying; <Q>Come out of her, my people (to wit, out of Babylon, the false church) that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: for her sins have reached to
<PB N="374" REF="037441_0890_100D94675FCF0930"/>heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities,</Q> Rev. xviii. 4, 5. Here ye may see, that God did call his peo∣ple out of spiritual Babylon before he destroyed her, and cast her down, to be utterly burnt with fire, ver. 8, 9, and 21.</P>
<P>Was not Nebuchadnezzar's empire thrown down and ended by Cyrus and Darius, who were of the seed of the Medes, before Cyrus and Darius gave forth their procla∣mation for all the Jews to go into their own land out of Babylon's captivity? and was there not a prophecy of Cy∣rus, <Q>That he should subdue nations, and that the Lord would loose the loins of kings before him, and break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron, and open the two-leaved gates; and that the gates should not be shut?</Q> And the Lord said; <Q>This is for Jacob, my servant's sake, and for Israel mine elect,</Q> Isa. xlv. Was not this fulfilled in Cyrus's and Darius's time? For did not then the Jews go out of captivity into their own land? Ezra i. 2, 3, 4, and chap. vi. 1. and 12. and Isa. xliv. 28. and xlv. 13. Was not this prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled, when the children of Israel came out of Babylon? Were not the Assyrians, that carried away the ten tribes subdued? and the Babylonians, that carried away the two tribes, were they not subdued in the days of Cyrus and Darius, in whose days the <Q>loins of kings were loosed, and the two-leaved gates of brass and iron were opened?</Q> and had not Israel and Jacob their liberty by them in their days, to go into their own Land?</P>
<P>And here in England, was it not observed, that most of the honest and sober people were turned out of the ar∣my, and their commissions, offices, and places taken from them, because they could not join with others in their cruelty and persecuting? and others laid down their com∣missions themselves, and came out from amongst those per∣secutors, before they were overthrown, and brought to confusion. All that are wise, see these things, and learn by such examples and way-marks to shun such bogs. The righteous are safe, that keep in Christ, their everlasting sanctuary, that changes not; in whom they have rest and peace with God, Amen.</P>

While I was at Kingston, one day meditating on the things of God, some particular observations arose in my mind concerning the first, and the 'second or last Adam. As that—</P>
<P>The first man Adam was made on the sixth day of the week; and Christ, the second Adam, was crucified on the sixth day of the Week.</P>
<P>The first Adam was betrayed by the serpent in the gar∣den of Eden: Christ our Saviour, the second Adam, was betrayed by Judas in a garden near Jerusalem.</P>
<P>Christ arose from the dead on the first-day of the week; and they that do believe on him are entered into Christ their rest: the christians meet together to worship God on the first day of the week; and on the first day of the week it was, that God said, <Q>Let there be light, and there was light.</Q> The Jews reft was on the seventh day of the week, which was given to them as a sign of the eternal rest of the Lord, sanctifying them, after they came out of the land of Egypt: for before that time the Lord had not giv∣en to man and woman his outward Sabbath-day to keep, neither in the old world, nor after in Abraham's time, nor in Isaac's, nor in Jacob's time; until the Jews came out of Egypt to Mount Sinai in the wilderness. Then the Lord gave the law, and his Sabbath, as a sign in the old covenant, of Christ the eternal rest in the new cove∣nant: and they that believe do enter into Christ their rest.</P>
<P>Adam, the first man, is the root from whence we all spring naturally: and Christ is called the last or second Adam, because he is the beginning and root of all that are spiritual.</P>
<P>The first Adam was made a living soul: and Christ the last Adam is a quickening spirit.</P>
<P>Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man, that they might all come into favour with God; and that every tongue should confess, that <Q>Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</Q></P>
<P>I wrote also a paper there, concerning the two seeds, dis∣tinguishing the seed wherein the blessing is received, from the seed which the curse remains upon. Of which the fol∣lowing is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord said to Abraham, <Q>In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,</Q> Gen. xxii. 18.
<PB N="376" REF="037441_0892_100D946B94141360"/><Q>And thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore, and as the dust of the earth, that cannot be numbered,</Q> chap. xiii. 16. and xv. 5. and xxii. 17. In this seed all nations and families of the earth are blessed; but not in the seed of evil-doers and of falsehood, nor in the seed of adultery and the whore, Isa. i. 4. and lvii. 3, 4. <Q>For the seed of the wicked shall be cut off, saith the Lord,</Q> Psal. xxxvii. 28. The Lord said to David, "That his seed should endure for ever," Psal. lxxxix. 36. And again it is said, Psal. cii. 28. <Q>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</Q> Here is a distinction betwixt the two seeds: for the seed of evil-doers, of the adulterer, whore, and of the wicked shall be cut off; so it is not blessed. But Christ bruises the head of the serpent and his seed, which he soweth in them, that disobey and transgress God's command, and rebel against Gods good Spirit. This wicked seed of the serpent is curst, and is an enemy to the seed, in whom all are blessed. But Christ bruises the head of this cursed seed of enmity, and destroys the devil and his works; and in his seed are all blessed, and all are in unity in this seed. All the children of the seed are the children of the kingdom of God and Christ, and are blessed with faithful Abraham. Whoever are of the saving, divine, precious faith, are of Abraham, walk in the steps of the seed and faith of Abraham, and are bles∣sed with him, yea, of all nations, and all the families of the earth.</P>
<P>The Lord said to Abraham, "Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years: and that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and after∣wards shall they (to wit, Gods seed) come out with great substance," Gen. xv. 13, 14. Here ye may see, that which afflicts God's seed, he will judge, and did judge; for he did destroy the first-birth of Pharaoh, and over∣threw him and his host.</P>
<P>An holy man said; "Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed or remnant, we had been as Sodom," &amp;c. that is destroyed. But in the seed, which destroys the devil and his works, and bruises the head of the serpent and his seed, are all nations and families of the earth blessed.</P>
<P>Christ, according to the flesh, was of Abraham and of
<PB N="377" REF="037441_0893_100D946D29CADE28"/>David: for he took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; in which seed all nations and families of the earth are blessed. And so they, that are of his seed, are of the generation of Christ; are <Q>flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone.</Q>—Now all nations and fami∣lies of the earth must be in this holy seed, if they have the blessings, and are blessed. And, <Q>out of the mouth of this seed's seed shall not God's word depart;</Q> but shall remain and abide in the mouth of this seed's seed, in which they are blessed, Isa. lix. 21. So it is not the first-birth's talking of the words of Christ, the seed, in whose mouth the word of God doth not abide, that makes an outward profession, like the Jews, that did kill and persecute the prophets, and crucify Christ the seed and substance of the law and prophets, which the Jews professed in words, but they denied Christ, the seed and life. All Christians (so called) that profess the scriptures in words, and are not in the seed Christ, are in the confusion, and are like the Jews. So neither Jews nor Christians are blessed, except they be in Christ, the seed of life.</P>
<P>But though Christ is said to be the seed of David, and of Abraham, as his generation is declared by Matthew and Luke; yet Christ was not born of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. For he was con∣ceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin, and sup∣posed to be the son of Joseph, but was the son of God. His name was called Jesus, because he should <Q>save his people from their sins;</Q> and Emanuel, God with us. Christ took not upon him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham (as I said before) and so was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and <Q>declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead,</Q> Rom. i. 4. So the generation of Christ is a mystery. Christ saw his seed or word grow up in his disciples; and <Q>Christ in you the hope of glory,</Q> the apostle calls <Q>the mystery, which hath been hid from ages and generations; but now is made manifest to the saints, or sanctified ones,</Q> Col. i. 26, 27. <Q>Whom we preach; warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,</Q> v. 28. For in Christ, the second Adam, all are made perfect and complete; and in Adam in the fall, all are deformed and made imperfect; so out of Christ all mankind are imperfect and deformed;
<PB N="378" REF="037441_0894_100D946FC9271038"/>let them paint and dress themselves with the sheep's cloth∣ing, and with the form of godliness, of the prophets, Christ's and his apostles words never so much; yet if Christ be not in them, they are incomplete, imperfect, de∣formed, reprobates. But the apostle tells the church of Christ, <Q>Ye are complete in Christ, which is the head of all principality and power,</Q> Col. ii. 10. (for he hath <Q>all power in heaven and earth giver to him,</Q> Matth. xxviii. 18.) So all the saints are made perfect and complete in Christ Jesus; blessed be the Lord God over all for ever, through Jesus Christ, Amen, Amer</P>

<P>Quickly after this I returned to London, and continued there a month in the service of the Lord; being daily exer∣cised either in public meetings, or more particular services relating to the church of Christ: as visiting such as were sick or afflicted, writing books or papers for the spreading of truth, or resuting of error. As it was a time of general liberty, the Papists appeared more open in their worship than formerly, and many unsettled people going to view them, a great talk there was of their praying to saints, and by beads, &amp;c. whereupon I wrote a short paper concern∣ing prayer; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST Jesus, when he taught his disciples to pray, said unto them, <Q>When ye pray, say; Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,</Q> &amp;c. Christ doth not say, they should pray to Mary, the mother of Christ; nor doth he say, they should pray to angels, or to saints that were dead. Christ did not teach them to pray to the dead, nor for the dead. Neither did Christ or his apostles teach the believers to pray by beads, nor to sing by outward organs; but the apostle said, he would sing and pray in the spirit: for the Spirit itself <Q>maketh inter∣cession; and the Lord, that searcheth the heart, knoweth the mind of the spirit.</Q></P>
<P>To take counsel of the dead, was forbidden by the law of God; they were to take counsel of the Lord. He hath given Christ in the new covenant, in his gospel-day, to be a counsellor and a leader to all believers in his light. Men are not to run to the dead for the living; for the law
<PB N="379" REF="037441_0895_100D94720A218950"/>and testimony of God forbids it. Those Jews, that refus∣ed the running waters of Shiloh, the floods and waters of the Assyrians and Babylonians came over them, and car∣ried them into captivity: and they that refuse the waters of Christ are overflowed with the flood of the world, that lieth in wickedness. They that asked counsel of stocks and stones, were in the spirit of error and whoredom; they were "gone a whoring from God," Hosea iv. 12. And they, that "joined themselves to Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead, provoked the Lord's anger, and brought the Lord's displeasure upon them," Psal. cvi. 28, 29. So here ye may see, the sacrifices of the dead were forbidden. The living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward: for the memory of them is forgotten, Ec∣cles. ix. 5. "Wo to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin," Isa. xxx. 1.</P>

<P>When I had staid about a month in London, I got out of town again: For by reason of the many hardships I had undergone in imprisonments, and other sufferings for truth's sake, my body was grown so infirm and weak, that I could not bear the closeness of the city long together; but was fain to go a little into the country, where I might have the be∣nefit of the fresh air. At this time I went with my son-in∣law William Mead, to his country-house called Gooses in Essex, where I staid about two weeks; and among other services, that I had there, I wrote the following paper:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="tract">
<HEAD>A Distinction between the true offering and sacrifice, and "the false, in the old and new covenant.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord saith, <Q>He that sacrificeth to any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroy∣ed,</Q> Exod. xxii. 20. So no god is to be minded, nor sacrificed to, but the Lord God. It is death to sacrifice to any other god, save the Lord. The Lord saith also, <Q>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leav∣ened bread,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 18. So that sour heavy leav∣en must not be offered with the Lord's sacrifice. Again the Lord saith; <Q>Thou shalt not build an altar of hewn
<PB N="380" REF="037441_0896_100D94741A785248"/>stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast pol∣luted it.</Q> Exod. xx. 25. Theresore have a care of pol∣luting the altar with your own tools, you that profess to offer the spiritual sacrifice.</P>
<P>Jonah said; <Q>He would sacrifice unto the Lord with the voice of thanksgiving,</Q> when he was in the sish's belly; and there he prayed unto the Lord, Jonah ii. For Jonah in the whale's belly had no lambs, nor rams, nor outward sacrifices to offer.</P>
<P>The Lord forbids his people to sacrifice with harlots, Hosea iv. 14. And the Lord forbids his people to offer sacrifice of the blind, lame, sick, or that which was deform∣ed, or had any blemish: as in Mal. i. and many other places. So they that offer spiritual sacrifice, must not offer the blind, lame, blemished, or deformed sacrifice to God.</P>
<P>The scribe saith unto Christ, <Q>To love God with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sa∣crifices,</Q> Mark xii. 33. <Q>And when Jesus saw, that he answered discreetly, he said unto him; Thou art not far from the kingdom of God,</Q> v. 34. To love God, and their neighbour as themselves, was more than whole burnt∣offerings and sacrifices in the time of the law; theresore all offerings and sacrifices in the time of the gospel, if there be not love to God and to their neighbour as themselves, avail nothing.</P>
<P>David said, <Q>Let them sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiv∣ing, and declare his works with rejoicing,</Q> Psal. cvii. 22. 'These are the sacrifices that the Lord requires of his people, more than outward sacrifices. David said, <Q>Let my pray∣er be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of mine hands as the evening sacrifice,</Q> Psal. cxli. 2. Here David looks upon his prayer to the Lord, and the lifting up of his hands to him, to be accepted with the Lord, as much as the outward incense, and the outward evening s∣crifice. Again David says, <Q>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise,</Q> Psal. li. 17. (See also Isa. lvii. 15. and chap. lxvi. 2.) These are the sacrifices that David said God would accept, and not despise; which are beyond the unbroken spirit, and uncontrite heart, with outward offerings and sacrifices.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="037441_0897_100D9475ADC00940"/>
The adversaries of the Jews would have joined with them towards the building of the temple, saying, <Q>Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him.</Q> But the Jews refused them, and said; <Q>Ye have nothing to do with us, to build an house unto our God,</Q> Ezra iv. 2, 3. Here ye may see God's people refused their building with them, and their sacri∣fice. Solomon saith, <Q>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</Q> Prov. xv. 8. (See also Isa. i. 11. and chap. lxvi. 3.) Solomon also saith, <Q>Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife,</Q> Prov. xvii. 1. Now let all people consider what good your house full of sacrifices doth with strife, when a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, is bet∣ter? Consider all people, if ye live in wickedness, your sacrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P>Again, Solomon speaking of the sacrifice of fools, saith; "They consider not, that they do evil," Eccles. v. 1. Fools are such as do not walk in the Spirit of God, or be∣gin in the spirit, and end in the flesh, like the foolish Gala∣tians: for the Spirit of God is the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, and cannot join with the sacrifices of the dead, nor of the fools, nor of the wicked, whose sacrifice is abominable; who grieve and quench the Spirit of God: by which the spiritual and righteous offer up spiritual sacri∣fices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>The apostle Paul saith, he was the <Q>minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost,</Q> Rom. xv. 16. So ye may see, that all the acceptable offerings and sacrifices to God must be sanctified by the Holy Ghost. The same apostle saith to the Corinthians; <Q>Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God, in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's,</Q> 1 Cor. vi. 20. And to the Romans, he saith; <Q>I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sa∣crifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea∣sonable service,</Q> Rom. xii. 1. This is the duty of all true Christians.</P>
<P>Peter also saith, in his general epistle to the church of Christ; <Q>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritu∣al house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifi∣ces, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</Q> 1 Pet. ii. 5.
<PB N="382" REF="037441_0898_100D947852915F48"/>So every man and woman must come to the Spirit of God in their own hearts, if they offer up spiritual sacrifices, ac∣ceptable to God by Jesus Christ. For as Christ saith, "Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt," Mark ix. 49. And in the Old Testament ye may see, all their outward offerings they were" to season with salt," Levit. ii. 13. A type and figure of Christ, who <Q>gave himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling sa∣vour,</Q> Ephes. v. 2. Therefore all his people must be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire, that they may be salted with fire, and every sacrifice salted with salt, with the Spirit of grace, that is poured upon all: so that they may offer up this spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Sanmel said to king Saul; "Hath the Lord as great de∣light in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the <Q>voice of the Lord? behold to obey is better than sacri∣fice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams,</Q> 1 Sam. xv. 22. So ye may see, all offerings and sacrifices are no∣thing, if there be not an hearkening to the Lord in his Spi∣rit, and an obeying of his voice. Christ told the Jews, who were outward sacrificers, that he would have mercy and not sacrifice and bid them <Q>go and learn what that meaneth,</Q> Matth. ix. 13.</P>

<P>The beginning of the third month I returned to London, and continued there till after the yearly meeting, which be∣gan the sixteenth, and was very large; friends having more freedom to come up out of the countries to it, by reason of the general toleration and liberty now granted. The meet∣ing lasted several days; and at the close thereof it was upon me to write the following lines, to be dispersed among friends e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery where, as— <Q>A word of counsel and caution to them to walk circumspectly in this time of liberty:</Q></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord by his eternal arm and power having sup∣ported you in all your sufferings, great spoiling of goods, and tedious imprisonments, only for serving and worshipping the living God that made you; who gave up
<PB N="383" REF="037441_0899_100D947A708BCF88"/>wife and children and goods, and suffered the spoil of them, and imprisonment for his truth and name's sake; the Lord, by his infinite power and mercy, having been pleased to open the king's heart towards you, by which you are set at liberty from gaols, and the spoilers of your goods are stopt, whereby ye may follow your callings, confess Christ Jesus, and call him Lord by the Holy Ghost, in your assemblies, without being cast into gaols, or having your goods spoiled. Dear brethren, a great con∣cern lies upon me from the Lord to write unto you, <Q>That none may abuse this liberty, nor the mercies of the Lord, but prize them;</Q> for there is great danger in time of liber∣ty, of getting up, and getting into ease, looseness, and false liberty. And now, seeing, that ye have not the out∣ward persecutors to war with in sufferings, with the spirit∣ual weapons keep down that which would not be subject to Christ; that he, the holy One, may reign in your hearts; that your lives, conversations, and words may preach righteonsness and truth; that ye may all shew forth good ensamples of true believers in Christ, in virtue and holi∣ness, answering that which may be known of God in all people, that ye are the sons and daughters of God; stand∣ing fast in that righteous, holy liberty in Christ, the just and holy One, that has made you free, over the loose or false; shunning the occasions of vain disputes, and foolish questions of men of corrupt minds: for the serpent was the first questioner of Eve, who drew her and Adam out of the truth. Therefore as ye have received Christ, live and walk in him, who bruises the serpent's head, who is your safe sanctuary; in whom ye have election reconcili∣ation, and peace with God. Therefore live in the peace which ye have from Christ, which is not of this world; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at peace one with another, and seek the peace of all me in Christ Jesus: for blessed are the peace-makers. Labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to exercise a good conscience towards God, in obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to him in what he requires, and in doing to all men the thing that is just and honest; in your conversations an words giving no offence to Jew or Gentile, nor to the church of God. So ye may be as a city set on God's Sion-Hill, which cannot be hid; and may be lights to the dark world, that they may see your good fruits, and glorify your Father which is in heaven: for he is glorified in your bringing forth good fruits, as ye abide in Christ, the vine, in this his day of life, power, and light, that shineth over
<PB N="384" REF="037441_0900_100D947C925271E8"/>all. Therefore all that believe in the light, walk in the light, as children of the light and of Christ's everlasting day; that in the light ye may have fellowship with the Father and the Son, and one with another; keeping in the unity of his Holy Spirit, in the bond of his holy peace, in his church, that he is head of. My desire is, that God's wisdom every where may be justified of her children, and that it may be shewed forth in meekness, and in the fear of the Lord in this his day, Amen.</P>

<P>By that time the yearly meeting was over, I was very much wearied and spent: wherefore about a week after I got out of town to a friend's house a little beyond Edmon∣ton, where, and at South-street, I abode some time, and had meetings amongst friends there; and at Winchmore∣hill and Berry-street. Having my mind continually exer∣cised in the things of God, the sense of his infinite good∣ness and mercy to mankink, in visiting them, after they had transgressed and rebelled against him, and providing a way and means for their return to him again, was very much upon me; and in the opening of the Spirit of truth, I writ the following paper on that subject:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>GOD, who made all men and women, though they have transgressed his commands and laws, rebelled against him, hated his light, grieved his Spirit, and walk∣ed despitefully against his Spirit of grace; yet he who is merciful, would have all to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. All that come to the knowledge of the truth, must know it in their inward parts; I say, the grace and truth, which comes by Jesus, all that know and find it, know and find it in their hearts. Such find the hidden man of the heart, the pearl, the leaven, the lost piece of silver, and the kingdom of heaven within. For until all come to the light and truth in their hearts, they have been strangers to these things, in Adam in the fall, from the image of God, his light, power and spirit, and kingdom. But Christ, that never fell, brings man and woman again, that follow him, to know these things, and to know the truth, him the Saviour, and brings them into his image, and his everlasting kingdom.</P>
<P>The devil, who is out of the truth, tempted man and woman to disobey God; and so drew them into the fall
<PB N="385" REF="037441_0901_100D947E37A9ADF8"/>from the truth. It is the devil that hath stopped men's eyes, ears, and hearts from the truth, who is called the god of the world; who hath blinded the eyes of infidels, or heathen. But Christ, who bruises the serpent's head, and destroys the devil and his works, doth open men's hearts, eyes, and ears, who is their Saviour and Redeemer, and giveth life eternal to his people, that obey him and his truth. Blessed be the Lord for ever through Jesus Christ, who hath tasted death for all men, to bring them out of the death of Adam; and is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified of in due time. For as by Adam's trans∣gression and disobedience death and condemnation came upon all men, so by Christ's obedience unto death, justi∣fication of life is come upon all men: and <Q>he that be∣lieveth in Christ hath eternal life; but he that doth not is condemned already.</Q> But God would have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Jesus, who is their Saviour; and in him there is no condemnation.</P>

<P>After I had been awhile here, I went to a monthly meeting at Enfield, and from thence with some friends to Hertford; where I staid three or four days, visiting friends both at their public meetings on first-day, and at their quar∣terly meetings of men and women: and good service for the Lord I had amongst them. Them passing to Waltham-Abby. I had a very good meeting with friends, and the next day went to another place, to compose a difference, which, for want of a right understanding of each other, had happened between some friends. I returned to Wal∣tham that night: and the next day went with some friends to William Mead's house in Essex.</P>
<P>Here I staid some weeks, yet was not idle, but often visited meetings thereabouts: as at Wanslead, Barking, and at John Harding's. Betwixt meeting and meeting I wrote many things for spreading truth, and opening peo∣ple's understandings to receive it. One was a paper, prov∣ing from the scriptures that people must repent before they can receive the gospel, and the Holy Spirit, and the king∣dom of God, or be baptized; after this manner:</P>

<P>JOHN the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <Q>Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</Q> Matth. iii. 12. When John the Baptist was cast into prison, Mark says; <Q>That Jesus came into Gali∣lee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe the gospel,</Q> Mark i. 14, 15. Matthew also says; <Q>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</Q> Matth. iv. 17. <Q>And when Christ sent forth his twelve disciples, two and two, they went out, and preached, that men should repent,</Q> Mark vi. 12. Christ said to the Jews, <Q>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</Q> Luke xiii. 3, 5. when the publicans and sinners came to hear Christ, and the Pharisees and Scribes mur∣mured, saying, <Q>This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them,</Q> Luke xv. 1, 2. Christ reproved them by a parable, and then told them; <Q>Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance,</Q> ver. 7. Adding, "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth," ver. 10. Christ, after he was risen, said unto his disciples, <Q>That re∣pentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem,</Q> Luke xxiv. 47. Peter said to the Jews, <Q>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,</Q> Acts ii. 38. Paul said, <Q>The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent,</Q> Acts xvii. 30. Simon Magus was called to repentance, if he had regarded it, Acts viii. 22. The apostle Paul did preach at Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles (turning them from darkness to the light of Christ, and from the power of Satan to God) that they should <Q>repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance,</Q> Acts xxvi. 20.</P>
<P>Here ye may see people must repent before they be∣lieve and are baptized, and before they receive the Holy Ghost and the kingdom of God. They must repent of their vain life and conversation before they receive the gos∣pel, and must be turned from darkness to the light of Christ, from the power of Satan unto God, before they
<PB N="387" REF="037441_0903_100D94844312AAB8"/>receive his holy Spirit and his gospel of life and salvation. The Lord doth command all men every where to repent, and do works meet for repentance. They must shew that their lives, conversations, and tongues are changed, and that they serve God in newness of life, with new tongues and new hearts.</P>

<P>GOD is righteous, and he would have his people to be righteous, and to do righteously. God is holy, and he would have his people holy, and to do holily.

God is an eternal, infinite Spirit, and his children must walk in the Spirit. God is merciful, and he would have his people to be merciful. God's sun shines upon the good and the bad, and he causes the rain to fall upon the evil and the good; so should his people do good unto all. God is love, and they that dwell in love dwell in God. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore "Love is the fulfilling of the law", Rom. xiii. 10.

<P>CHRIST saith, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me." John xiv. 6. And again, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him", John vi. 44. Now, what is the means by which God doth draw his people to his Son, but by his holy Spirit, who "poureth out of his Spirit upon all flesh," that is, all men and women. By this holy Spirit the holy and righteous God doth draw people from their unrighteousness and un∣holiness to Christ, the righteous and holy One, the great Prophet in his New Covenant and New Testament, whom Moses in the Old Covenant and Testament said, God would raise up like unto him, whom people should <Q>hear in all things; and they that would not hear him should be cut off.</Q> They that do not hear the Son of God, the great Prophet, do not mind the drawing of the Father by his holy Spirit to his Son; but they that mind the drawings of the good Spirit of the Father to his Son, the Spirit doth give them understanding to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life. Then they know that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and that none can come unto God but by and through his Son, who is their shepherd to feed them in his pastures and springs of life; and his sheep know his holy voice, in whom there was no sin, and in whose mouth there was no guile, and an hireling they will not hear, for he careth not for the sheep: for they are not the hireling's but Christ's, who hath laid down his life for his sheep. He that robs and steals his neighbour's words, climbeth up another way, and entereth not by the door, is a thief and a robber; but Christ is the door into his sheepfold, for his sheep to enter in by. They know that Christ is the bishop of their souls, to see that they do not go astray from God nor 'out of his pastures of life. They know that Christ is their mediator, who makes their peace with God. They know that Christ is their high-priest, made higher than the heavens, and hath died for their sins, and doth cleanse them with his blood, and is risen for their justification, and is able to the utmost to save all that come to God by him.</P>

Before I left this place I wrote another paper, the scope whereof was to shew, by many instances taken out of the holy scriptures, that the kingdom of God, which most people talk of at a distance and refer altogether to another life, is in some measure to be known and entered into in this life; but that none can know an entrance thereinto, but such as are regenerated and born again. Of that paper the following is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST saith, "except a man be born again he can∣not see the kingdom of God," John iii. 3. <Q>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</Q> ver. 6. So <Q>except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</Q> ver. 5. And John, writing to the seven churches of Asia, calls himself their <Q>brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and pati∣ence of Jesus Christ,</Q> Rev. i. 9. Here you may see that John was in the kingdom, so he was born again: for he did not only see the kingdom but was in it.</P>
<P>And John saith, <Q>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not,</Q> 1 John iii. 1. <Q>Beloved, now are we the sons of God,</Q> ver. 2. <Q>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doth righte∣ousness is born of him,</Q> chap. ii. 29. <Q>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God.</Q> chap. iii. 9. <Q>Let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love,</Q> chap. iv. 7, 8. <Q>Whosoever believ∣eth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God,</Q> chap. v. 1. <Q>Whosoever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,</Q> ver. 4. Were not these that were born of God in the kingdom of God? And seeing John says, <Q>Every one that doth righteousness is born of God;</Q> do not such see the kingdom of God, that stands in righteousness, and en∣ter into it?</P>
<P>Peter, in his first general epistle to the church of Christ, saith, "As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby," 1 Pet. ii. 2. And he
<PB N="390" REF="037441_0906_100D948A1B514940"/>tells them they were <Q>a chosen generation, a royal priest∣hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,</Q> that they should <Q>shew forth the praises of him who had called them out of darkness into his marvellous light,</Q> ver. 9. And that <Q>as lively stones they were built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</Q> ver. 5. Did not these new∣born babes, these lively stones, spiritual household, royal priesthood, holy nation, and chosen generation, who were called out of darkness into Christ's marvellous light, see and enter into his holy kingdom, being heirs of the same? who were <Q>born again, not of corruptible seed but of in∣corruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abid∣eth for ever,</Q> 1 Pet. i. 23. And had not such an en∣trance ministered to them into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>James, in his general epistle to the church of Christ, saith, <Q>Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</Q> James ii. 5. The apostle Paul saith, <Q>God sent forth his son made of a woman, &amp;c. to re∣deem them that were under the law, that we may receive the adoption of sons; and because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son, and if a son then an heir of God through Christ,' Gal. iv. 4, 5, 6, 7. The same apostle saith, As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God;</Q> and tells the saints at Rome, <Q>Ye have receiv∣ed the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together,</Q> (namely with Christ) Rom. viii. 14, 15, 16, 17. Now seeing they are the sons of God that are led by the Spirit of God, and the Spirit beareth witness unto their spirit that they are the children of God, heirs of God, and joint∣heirs with Christ, are not all these children of God heirs of the righteous glorious kingdom of God? And do they not see it and enter into it?</P>
<P>The Lord saith in Hosea i. 10. <Q>Where it was said unto them, ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, ye are the sons of the Living God.</Q> Did not
<PB N="391" REF="037441_0907_100D948CC4D6B560"/>this relate to the gospel-days of the New Covenant? See Rom. ix. 26. And what the Lord said by the prophet: Jeremiah, chap. xxxi. 1. the apostle applies to the gospel-day, and says, <Q>Be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daugh∣ters, saith the Lord Almighty,</Q> 2 Cor. vi. 16. Are not these the children that see and enter into the righteous kingdom of God, that separate from that which is unclean and touch it not?</P>
<P>The Lord faith also by Isaiah, <Q>I will say to the north, give up, and to the south, keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,</Q> Isa. xliii. 6. Then doth not he bring them to his king∣dom of glory, that stands in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost?</P>
<P>The Lord said to Job, <Q>When the morning-stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,</Q> Job. xxxviii. 7. Where did these sons of God shout for joy? Was it not in his kingdom of glory?</P>
<P>Christ saith, <Q>The least in the kingdom of God is greater than John,</Q> Luke vii. 28. And in chap. xvi. 16. he says, <Q>The law and the prophets were until John; since that time (viz. since the law and the prophets and John) the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</Q></P>
<P>The good seed are the children of the kingdom, Matt. xiii. 38. And <Q>the righteous shall shine sorth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father,</Q> ver. 43. Christ said unto his disciples, <Q>Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God.</Q> Mark iv. 11. Christ lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up his eyes upon his disciples, and said, <Q>Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God,</Q> Luke vi. 20. The apostles preached the kingdom of God. These were born again, that saw and knew the kingdom of God and preached it.</P>
<P>Christ said to his disciples, <Q>Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the king∣dom.</Q> Luke xii. 32. "I appoint to you a kingdom," said Christ, "as my Father hath appointed to me." chap. xxii. 29. The Lord said, <Q>He that overcometh shall in∣herit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be my son,</Q> Rev. xxi. 7. And John saith, <Q>I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the
<PB N="392" REF="037441_0908_100D948E56DB45C8"/>word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one,</Q> 1 John ii. 14. And Christ, by whom are all things, is said "to bring many sons to glory," Heb. ii. 10.</P>
<P>He said, <Q>Wo unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypo∣crites, for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,</Q> Matt. xxiii. 13. <Q>Wo unto you, lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered,</Q> Luke xi. 52. Christ gives unto his chil∣dren the keys of the kingdom, his Spirit; but the scribes, pharisees, and lawyers, great professors, who were erred from the Spirit, like the great professors in our age, that scoff at the Spirit, and draw people from the Spirit of God within, these shut up the kingdom from men, and draw people from the key of knowledge, and the key of the kingdom. <Q>For no man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God;</Q> for the things of God are spi∣ritually discerned. The Spirit is the key, by which the kingdom of God and the things of God are revealed, dis∣cerned, and known, according to 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 13, 14. The apostle names some in his epistle to the Colossians, and says, <Q>These are my fellow-workers unto the king∣dom of God,</Q> Col. iv. 11. And he tells that church, that <Q>God hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</Q> chap. i. 13. So ye may see these were born again that were translated into the kingdom of Christ, and were fel∣low-workers unto the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Christ exhorts his disciples to love and to do good, that they might be the children of their Father which is in hea∣ven, Matt. v. 45. He bids them be perfect, even as their Father which is in heaven is perfect, ver. 48. The apos∣tle saith to the church at Philippi, <Q>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation;</Q> amongst whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, &amp;c. Phil. ii. 15, 16. And writing to the church of the Thessalonians, he puts them in mind how he had exhorted them that they would <Q>walk worthy of God, who had called them into his kingdom and glory,</Q> 1 Thess. ii. 12.</P>
<P>The Lord had promised by the prophet Joel, that he
<PB N="393" REF="037441_0909_100D94906B32D298"/>would "pour out his Spirit upon all flesh," and that <Q>Sons and daughters should prophesy, old men should dream dreams, and young men see visions,</Q> Joel ii. 28. The cause that sons and daughters, hand-maids, servants, young men, and old men have not these heavenly visions, dreams, and prophecies, is because they are <Q>erred from the Spirit of God,</Q> which he poureth upon them; but as ma∣ny as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.</P>
<P>John saith Christ was the true light, "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," John i. 9. And that <Q>as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, ver. 12. which were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God,</Q> ver. 13. The reason why people do not become the sons of God, is because they do not receive Christ. The Jews, the great professors, who had the promises, prophecies, figures, and shadows of him, would not receive him when he came. And now the priests and high professors of Christ are so far from receiving the light of Christ, and believing in it, that they hate the light and scoff at it, cal∣ling it a natural conscience, and some, <Q>Jack in the lan∣thorn.</Q> Such are not like to become the sons of God, nor to see the glorious kingdom of Christ, which stands in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For the light that shines in the heart gives the <Q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus.</Q> They that do not receive Christ Jesus, but hate his light (which is the life in him) and yet profess him in words, neither know the children of the light, nor true fellowship in the light, nor the kingdom of God, that stands in right∣eousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; but by the light they are condemned. <Q>And this is the condemna∣tion, that light is come into the world, and men love dark∣ness rather than light, because their deeds are evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved,</Q> John iii. 19, 20. But the children of the light, that walk in the light, come to heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the Liv∣ing God, to the innumerable company of angels, and to the general assembly and church of the first-born, that are written in heaven, and can sing Hallelujah.</P>

Having been more than a quarter of a year in the coun∣try, I returned to London somewhat better in health than sormerly, having received much benefit by the country air. And it being a time of general liberty and great openness amongst the people, I had much service for the Lord in the city, being almost daily at publick meetings, and fre∣quently taken up in visiting friends that were sick, and in other services of the church. I continued at London about three months; then finding my strength much spent with continual labouring in the work of the Lord, and my body much stopped for want of fresh air, I went to my son Rouse's by Kingston, where I abode some time, and visited friends at Kingston. While I was there, it came upon me to write a paper concerning the Jews, shewing, <Q>How by their dis∣obedience and rebellion they lost the holy city and land.</Q> By which example the professed Christians may see what they are to expect, if they continue to disobey and provoke the Lord. The copy here followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord gave the Jews in the Old Testament the land of Canaan, and they built the temple at Jerusa∣lem to worship in. It was called "the Holy temple," and Jerusalem was called "the Holy City," and Canaan <Q>the Holy Land.</Q> But when the Jews rebelled against the good Spirit which God gave them to instruct them, and rebelled against his law, and set up idols and images, and defiled the land and the city, the Lord sent his prophets to cry against them, to bring them back again to his Spirit, and to his law, and so to God, to serve and worship him, that they might not worship images and idols, the works of their own hands. But instead of hearkening to God's prophets, they persecuted them, and at last killed his Son Christ Jesus, and persecuted his apostles. But Christ told the Jews that both their city and temple should be laid waste, and they should be scattered over all nations; and it was so. Titus the Roman Emperor came and took Je∣rusalem, and destroyed the city and temple, which was a day of vengeance upon the Jews for all their idolatries, thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wickedness, and for the innocent blood they had shed both in the city and country; and they were driven out of their own city and land, and scattered over all nations. The Jews had never power to get the land since, nor to build Jerusalem nor the temple; but the Turk hath both the land of Canaan and that which is called <Q>the City of
<PB N="395" REF="037441_0911_100D94957620D790"/>Jerusalem.</Q> Now the Turk neither makes images nor worships images; so it is a just hand of the Lord that he should be over the persecuting, idolatrous Jews, so that they cannot defile the land of Canaan now with images and idols, for the Turk hath not, who neither makes ima∣ges nor idols, nor worships them. The Jews must never hope, believe, nor expect, that ever they shall go again in∣to the land of Canaan, to set up an outward worship at Jerusalem, and there for their priests to offer outward sa∣crifices of rams, sheep, and heifers, &amp;c. for burnt-offer∣ings; for Christ, the one offering, hath offered himself once for all, and by this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. And Christ hath changed the priesthood of Aaron, that offered sacrifices, which was made after the power of a carnal commandment; but Christ was made after the power of an endless life, a priest for ever, who was holy, harmless, and separate from sin∣ners, and is a priest made higher than the heavens. This is the priest that gives power to all that receive him to become the sons and daughters of God; and Jerusalem that is above is the mother of all the sons and daughters of God, which is free; but Jerusalem that is below is in bondage with her children. They that are the children of Jerusalem that is above do not look down at Jerusalem that is below; but they look at Jerusalem that is above, which is their mother. Christ said, <Q>Neither at outward Jerusalem, nor in the mountain of Samaria should God be worshipped; but God should be worshipped in Spirit and in truth; for he is a Spirit, and such he seeks to wor∣ship him,</Q> John iv. This is the worship that Christ set up above sixteen hundred years ago; therefore the idola∣trous Jews must never think to offer their outward offer∣ings and sacrifices, nor set up their outward worship at Jerusalem, in the holy land of Canaan more. For Christ, by the offering up of himself once for all, for the sins of the whole world, hath ended all the Jews offerings, and changed the priesthood, and the law by which it was made, and hath blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, which commanded both priests and offerings, and triumphed over them. So he is the offering and sacrifice of all the children of the New Testament, New Covenant, and hea∣venly New Jerusalem that is above. He is their Prophet 'that openeth to them, their Shepherd that seeds them, their Bishop that oversecs them, and Priest that died for their
<PB N="396" REF="037441_0912_100D9497A1144EB8"/>sins and is risen for their justification, who sanctifies and presents them to God. He is the one Mediator betwixt God and man, even the Man Christ Jesus.</P>

<P>After this I went to Guildford to visit friends there, and staid three days with them, and had a large and very good meeting on first-day. After which I came back to King∣ston again, and tarried about two weeks longer, visiting friends and having meetings amongst them, both at their publick meeting-house and in their families. Many things I wrote while I was at Kingston; amongst which the fol∣lowing was one:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><Q>GOD so loved the world, that he gave his only begot∣ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish (mark, not perish) but have everlasting life,</Q> John iii. 16. Again he saith, <Q>He that believeth on the Son of God hath (mark, hath) everlasting life,</Q> ver. 36. So these believers have everlasting life while they are upon the earth. And <Q>he that believeth on Christ is not con∣demned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him. He that heareth Christ's word, and believeth on God that sent him, hath (mark, hath) everlasting life, and shall not come into con∣demnation; but is passed from death,</Q> the death in the first Adam, "to life," the life in Christ the second Adam, John v. 24. And that meat which Christ doth give en∣dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th unto everlasting life, as in John vi. 27. And the water that Christ doth give shall be in him that drinks it "a well of water springing up into everlasting life," John iv. 14. Christ said to the Jews, <Q>Search the scrip∣tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me: And ye will not come to me that ye might have life;</Q> John v. 39, 40. Here ye may see, the eternal life is to be found in Christ, and not in the scriptures which testify of him, the life. Christ's sheep that hear his voice, know, and follow him; he gives unto them eternal life, and they shall not perish, neither shall any pluck them out of his hand. They shall not pluck Christ's sheep, to whom he hath given eternal life, out of his eternal hand. Christ said to Martha, "I am
<PB N="397" REF="037441_0913_100D9499345E4BB8"/>the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead (mark, though he were dead) yet shall he live (mark, live though he were dead); and who∣soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Be∣lievest thou this?" Martha said, "Yea, Lord," John xxv. 26. This is the true substantial belief, which they that believe shall not perish, but have everlasting life. John saith, <Q>This is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</Q> John v. 11. <Q>The life was manifested, and we have seen it and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us,</Q> 1 John i. 2. So these were the believers that had eternal life in the Son of God, and shewed it unto others. <Q>He that hath the Son hath life,</Q> saith John, <Q>and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life,</Q> 1 John v. 12. Christ saith, <Q>Every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sist∣ers, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life,</Q> Matt. xix. 29. The wicked that do not receive Christ shall go into everlasting punish∣ment, but the righteous into everlasting life. The true servants of God have their fruits unto holiness, and their end is everlasting life. For <Q>the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</Q> Such have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Therefore I de∣sire that God's people may endure all things, that they may obtain this salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. For Christ, being made perfect, became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him. This eternal salvation is above an external salvation; for they come to receive an eternal inheritance, and live in the possession of the everlasting gospel of joy, comfort, peace, and salvation, having everlasting life in Christ Jesus.</P>

<P>Another paper I wrote concerning the stone spoken of by Daniel, chap ii. which became a great mountain and silled the whole earth, shewing <Q>That thereby was set forth the kingdom and power of Christ.</Q></P>

<PB N="398" REF="037441_0914_100D949CD5EC0B98"/>
<P>WHEN Christ, the stone that became a great moun∣tain, and filled the whole earth, had broke to pie∣ces the head of gold, the breast of silver, the belly of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet part clay, which were the four monarchies, the Babylonian and Mede, the Grecian, and the Roman, and had ended the outward Jews typical kingdom, Daniel saith, <Q>In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed,</Q> Dan. ii. 44. Christ saith, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth," Matth. xxviii. 18. And <Q>My kingdom is not of this world,</Q> John xviii. 36. <Q>Christ is the image of the in∣visible God, the first-born of every creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things consist,</Q> Col. xv. 16, 17. Here Ye may see all things consist by Jesus Christ, and all things were created by Christ and for him, whether they be things in heaven or things in earth, visible or invisible; yea thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, these were all created by him and for him. Christ is <Q>King of kings and Lord of lords,</Q> Rev. xix. 16. The <Q>Prince of the kings of the earth,</Q> Chap. i. 5. Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, with which he shall smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessel of a potter shall they be dashed in pieces who do not obey him, the "King of kings and Lord of lords." This is Christ, who saith, <Q>I am Alpha and Omega, the Begin∣ning and the Ending, the First and the Last;</Q> so he is over all nations, and above them all. We must under∣stand this rod of iron, by which Christ doth rule the na∣tions, is a figurative speech of Christ who is ascended into heaven, and is at the right hand of God. All power in heaven and earth is given unto him, and all things were created by him and for him: so then they are Christ's, and he hath power over all things; for all are his. So, as the scripture saith, <Q>By me kings reign and princes de∣cree justice,</Q> Prov. viii. 15. But if they abuse his power and do not do justice, as is decreed by Christ, the <Q>King of kings and Lord of lords, the First and the Last,</Q> they must seel the weight of his rod of iron, by which he will rule such as abuse his power. That is decreed by him,

<P>Several other things I wrote while I was at Kingston for my spirit being continually exercised towards God, I had many precious openings of divine matters; and divers places of scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New, relating to the state of regeneration and sanctification, &amp;c. were brought to my remembrance by the Holy Spirit; some of which I committed to writing, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THEY that touched the dead were unclean, and were to be cleansed by the water of purification, Numb. xix. And they which touch the dead doctrines or faiths, and let them in, burden the pure, defile and make them∣selves unclean, until the spring of the water of the Word do arise and wash and clean them; for all the dead in Adam in the fall are unclean, and they must be washed by Christ, in his blood and water of life, who quickeneth and makes alive.</P>
<P>A dwarf might not come near to offer upon God's al∣tar; but he might eat of the holy bread, that he might grow, Lev. xxi. 20, &amp;c. So the new-born babes may eat of the milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby and increase. He that had any blemish might not come near to offer upon God's altar; neither might any thing be of∣fered upon God's altar that had any blemish, or was un∣clean, Lev. xxi. And it is said, <Q>The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous,</Q> Psa. i. 5. But God standeth in the con∣gregation of the mighty, Psal. lxxxii. 1.</P>
<P>The camp of God was to be kept clean and holy. That which was unclean, or defiled, was to be kept out of God's camp in the Old Testament. And in the New Testa∣ment, all that is defiled and unclean must be kept out of God's kingdom, the new and heavenly Jerusalem that is from above. All was to pass through the fire (even of those things that would bear the fire) and to be purified by sire and water, before the people might come into God's camp, Numb. xxxi. So all must be circumcised, and baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, cleansed with
<PB N="400" REF="037441_0916_100D953C9E3C14F0"/>the blood of Christ, and washed with the water of the Word, before they come into the kingdom of God, into heavenly Jerusalem.</P>
<P>The apostle Paul saith, <Q>We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a build∣ing of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, that mortality might be swallowed up of life,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 1, 2, 4. Here is "[WE in the earthly house of this tabernacle;"] which [WE] are they that have received Christ, are become the sons of God, new creatures, and children of the light, that believe in Christ's light; who have an eter∣nal house in the heavens, where mortality is swallowed up of life, in which house from heaven they will not groan.</P>
<P>Peter said, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remem∣brance, knowing that shortly I must put off this my ta∣bernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me,</Q> 2 Pet. i. 13, 14. Peter knew he must put off this taber∣nacle shortly: but as long as he was in it, he did stir up the saints to their duty in holiness, that they might re∣member it after he was deceased.</P>
<P>Paul saith, "The first man is of the earth, earthly." (mark, earthly) 1 Cor. xv. 47. <Q>And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly,</Q> (mark, the heavenly) ver. 49. And <Q>we have this treasure in earthen vessels,</Q> &amp;c. 2 Cor. iv. 7. "And I live," said he, "yet not I, but Christ liveth in me," Gal. ii. 20. who is the life of all God's people.</P>
<P>Christ said to the Jews, <Q>That the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; for he is not the God of the dead, but of the liv∣ing, for all live unto him,</Q> Luke xx. 37, 38. So <Q>none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died and rose, that he might be Lord both of the dead and liv∣ing,</Q> Rom. xiv. 7, 8, 9. For all died in Adam: and Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man, that they might come out of the death in Adam to the eternal life in Jesus Christ: who is also a quickening spirit; for
<PB N="401" REF="037441_0917_100D7FB2B960A8E0"/>as in Adam all died, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. So Christ that died and rose again, is Lord both of the living and of the dead; for the living live to the Lord, and die in him, and are blessed.</P>
<P>All Christendom say, that they believe in God and in Christ, and that they believe Moses and the prophets, and preach Christ, Moses, and the prophets; so their words and writings are preached and printed, and ye say ye be∣lieve them. But what life do ye live? Are ye through the law dead to the law, that ye may live unto God? Are ye crucified with Christ? Doth Christ live in you? Is the life that ye now live in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God, and ye do not live, but Christ liveth in you, who gave himself for you? Is this your present life? for "the just live by the faith" which Christ is the Author and Finisher of; by which holy, divine, precious faith they have victory over that which is vile, unholy, and not di∣vine; and in this faith they please God, and have access to God and his Son, who fulfilleth the law and the pro∣phets. For the law and the prophets were until John, and since that the kingdom of God hath been preached, and men press into it; and the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John, though he was the greatest prophet born of a woman. See whether ye are in the kingdom that stands in peace and righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost, or not. Christ, the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature, was before any creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven and in the earth, visible or invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, <Q>all things were created by him and for him, and he was before all things, and by him all things consist: and he is the head of the body, the church, and is the beginning, the first-born from the dead.</Q> Here ye may see that all things were made by Christ Jesus, and all things were created for Christ Jesus, and by him all things consist and have their being, who is the first-born from the dead, and dieth no more. It pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell, and by Christ to reconcile all things unto himself, whether they be things in heaven or things in the earth. "In him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," who is the head of all principality and power; for <Q>all power in heaven and earth is given to him,</Q> the first-born of every creature, and the first-born from the dead, who
<PB N="402" REF="037441_0918_100D7FB573130ED8"/>liveth for evermore in his power over all, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. While the world's spi∣rit rules in men's hearts, they do not know Christ, nor the beginning nor ending of the work of God. Christ was outwardly crucified and slain without the gates of Jerusa∣lem by the disobedient Jews; and they that hate the light of Christ, disobey his gospel, quench his Spirit, and are erred from his faith, "crucify to themselves Christ afresh." So Adam and Eve, and their children that disobeyed God, did slay the Lamb; the blind Jews, that disobeyed God, crucified Christ Jesus; and the outward Christians, that live and walk not in Christ, but in sin and evil, though they make an outward profession of Christ, yet crucify to themselves Christ afresh. As to Christ himself, he is <Q>as∣cended far above all principalities, thrones, powers, and dominions;</Q> so that they cannot put him to death, or crucify him any more, as to himself: but what the killers, crucifiers, and persecutors do now upon the earth, is against Christ in themselves, and in his members; as Christ said to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?" Acts ix. 4. For what is done to his members, Christ takes as done to himself, Matth. xxv. 40, and 45. And they that did not visit Christ, but persecuted him in his members, persecuted Christ in themselves first.</P>
<P>The serpent, that enemy to man and woman, the des∣troyer, the god of the world, and prince of the air, that ruleth in the hearts of the disobedient, got in by disobedi∣ence. But Christ bruises his head, breaketh his power to pieces, and destroys the devil and his works; and through death destroys death, and the devil, the power of death. So Christ, the light and life, hath all power in heaven and earth; and openeth the prison doors, and the eyes of the blind, and takes captive him that hath led into captivity, and gives gifts unto men. So Christ bindeth the strong man of sin, and spoils his goods, and casts him out; Hal∣lelujah! For the strong man of sin is the god of the world, and his house is that whole world that lieth in wickedness. And this God of the world hath kept his house, and his goods have been in peace: until a stronger than he come, and binds, and casts him out: and then destroys him and his goods. So Christ, the Son of God, who is stronger than the devil, having destroyed the devil and his works, setteth up his own house. All believers in the light are the children of light, are of the Son of God's spiritual
<PB N="403" REF="037441_0919_100D94A0AD40FDD0"/>house, and the Son of God is over his house for evermore: glory to God in the highest, through Jesus Christ, Amen!</P>
<P>God spake by the mouth of his holy prophets concern∣ing Christ Jesus, his Son, the holy One: so they were ho∣ly men, and not unholy, that God spake by. All that name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, are to depart from iniquity.</P>

<P>I returned to London towards the latter end of the ele∣venth month 1687, visiting friends in the way at Chiswick and Hammersmith, where I had two meetings, one upon a feast-day, and the other on occasion of a marriage; at which were many people of other denominations, amongst whom I had a very seasonable opportunity of opening the way of truth.</P>
<P>Being come to London, I visited meetings in and about the city, as the Lord led me! in whose service I continued labouring till the middle of the first-month 1687-8. At which time I went towards Enfield, and visited friends there and thereabouts, and at Barnet, Waltham-Abbey, and other places; where I had many meetings, and very good service, in which I spent several weeks. I then returned to London, where I continued labouring in the work of the gospel till after the yearly meeting, which this year was about the beginning of the fourth month. A precious meet∣ing it was. A very refreshing season friends had together, the Lord vouchsasing to honour our assemblies with his liv∣ing glorious presence in a very plentiful manner. At the conclusion of the meeting I felt a concern upon my spirit to give forth the following paper, to be dispersed amongst friends.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL you believers in the night, that are become chil∣dren of the light, walk as children of the light, and of the day of Christ, as a city set on a hill, that cannot be hid. Let your light so shine, that people may see your good works, and glorify your Father, which is in heaven. For a good tree bringeth forth good fruit; therefore be ye trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, having fruits unto holiness; and then your end will be everlasting life. Such are the wells and cisterns that hold the living
<PB N="404" REF="037441_0920_100D94A25B91A1E8"/>water, which springs up in them to eternal life. Ye may all drink water out of your own cisterns, running water out of your own wells; and eat every one of his own fig∣tree, and of his own vine; having salt every one in your∣selves, to season every one's sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; like wise virgins, that have oil in their lamps, follow the Lamb, and enter in with the bride∣groom. Now is the time to labour, while it is day (yea, the day of Christ) to stir up every one's pure mind, the gift of God that is in them; and to improve your talents, that Christ hath afforded you, that ye may profit; and to walk every one according to the measure that Christ hath given you; for <Q>the manifestation of the Spirit of God is given to every one to profit withal.</Q> Consider what you have profited in spiritual and heavenly things, with the heavenly Spirit of God. Be not like the wicked and slothful, that hid his talent; from whom it was taken, and he cast into utter darkness. A dwarf, or one that had any blemish, was not to come nigh to offer upon God's altar; therefore mind the word of wisdom, to keep you out of that which will corrupt and blemish you; and that ye may grow in grace, in faith, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ: and feeding upon the milk of the word, may grow by it, that ye may not be dwarfs; and so offer your spiritual sacrifice upon God's holy altar. For the field or vineyard of the slothful grows over with thorns and nettles, and his walls go down. Such are they that are not diligent in the Spirit of God, and the power, which is the wall, a sure fence. The Spirit of God wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weed out all thorns, thistles, and nettles out of the vine∣yard of the heart.

Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the Lord in your hearts, that ye may be a holy people to the Lord, who saith; <Q>Be ye holy, for I am holy;</Q> that ye may be the holy members of the church of Christ, that is clothed with the sun, and hath the moon under her feet; the changeable world, with all her changeable worships, religions, churches, and teachers. Be ye new and heavenly Jerusalem's children; for new and heavenly Jerusalem, that is above, is the mother of all the children of light, that are born of the Spirit.

He takes away the curse, and the vail that is spread over all nations, and over all the families of the earth, and brings the blessing upon all (if they will receive it) saying, <Q>In thy seed shall all nations and all the fa∣milies of the earth be blessed.</Q> This is the gospel of God preached to Abraham, before Moses wrote his five books; and was preached in the apostles days, and is now preached again; which brings life and immortality to light; and is the gospel of peace, life, and salvation to every one that believes it. So all nations, all the families of the earth must be in Christ, the seed, if they be blessed, and be partakers of the blessing in the seed. This gospel was revealed by Christ to his apostles, who preached it; which is not of man, nor from man. Now, God and Christ hath revealed the same gospel unto me, and many others in this age (I say the gospel, and the seed, in which all nations and families of the earth are blessed;) in which gospel I have laboured, and do labour, that all may come into this blessed seed, Christ, who bruises the head of the serpent, that in it they might have peace with God. This everlasting gospel is preached again to them that dwell upon the earth; and they that believe it, and receive it, receive the blessing, the peace, joy, and comfort of it, the stability in it, and the life and immortality which it brings to light in them and to them. Such can praise the ever∣lasting God in his everlasting gospel.</P>
<P>And friends, all seek the peace and good of all in Christ: for truth makes no Cains, Corahs, Balaams, nor Judasses; for they come to be such, that go out of the peaceable truth. Therefore walk in the peaceable truth, and speak the truth in the love of it, as it is in Jesus.</P>

<P>Some time after the yearly meeting I went to my son Mead's in Essex, and abode some weeks; often visiting friends meetings near, and sometimes at Barking. After I had been awhile there, I went to visit friends at Waltham-Abbey, Hodsdon, Enfield, South-street, Ford-Green, and
<PB N="406" REF="037441_0922_100D94A746061188"/>Winchmore-hill; where I had several very serviceable meetings; the Lord opening many deep and weighty things through me, for the informing the understandings of inquirers, and building up those that were gathered into the truth, and establishing them therein.</P>
<P>In the seventh month I returned to London, having been near three months in the country for my health's sake, which was very much impaired; so that I was hardly able to stay in a meeting the whole time, and often after a meet∣ing was fain to lie down upon a bed. Yet did not my weak∣ness of body take me off from the service of the Lord; but I continued to labour in and out of meetings in the work of the Lord, as he gave me opportunity and ability.</P>
<P>I had not been long in London, before a great weight came upon me, and a sight the Lord gave me of the great bustles and troubles, revolution and change, which soon after came to pass. In the sense whereof, and in the mov∣ings of the Spirit of the Lord, I wrote, <Q>A general epistle to friends, to forewarn them of the approaching storm; that they might all retire to the Lord, in whom safety is,</Q> as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY dear friends and brethren every where, who have received the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom he has given power to become his sons and daughters; in him ye have life and peace, and in his everlasting kingdom, that is an established kingdom, and cannot be shaken, but is over all the world, and stands in his power, and in righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost, into which no unrighteous∣ness, nor the soul unclean spirit of the devil in his instru∣ments can enter. Dear friends and brethren, every one in the faith of Jesus, stand in his power, who has all power in heaven and earth given to him, and will <Q>rule the na∣tions with his rod of iron, and dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel,</Q> that are not subject and obedient to his power: whose voice will shake the heavens, and the earth, that that which may be shaken may be removed, and that which cannot be shaken may appear. Stand in him; and all things shall work together for good to them that love him.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends and brethren, though these waves, storms, and tempests be in the world, yet you may all appear the harmless and innocent lambs of Christ, walking in his peaceable truth, and keeping in the Word of pow∣er,
<PB N="407" REF="037441_0923_100D94A93AE96BC0"/>wisdom, and patience; and this Word will keep you in the day of trials and temptations, that will come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. For the Word of God was before the world, and all things were made by it: it is a tried Word, which gave God's people in all ages wisdom, power, and patience. Therefore let your dwelling and walking be in Christ Jesus, who is called the Word of God; and in his power, which is over all. Set your affections on things that are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God (mark) on those things which are above, where Christ sits; not those things that are below, which will change and pass away. Blessed be the Lord God, who by his eternal arm and power hath gathered a people to himself, and hath preserved his faithful to himself through many troubles, trials, and temptations: his power and seed, Christ, is over all, and in him ye have life and peace with God. There∣fore in him all stand, and see your salvation, who is first and last, and the Amen. God Almighty preserve and keep you all in him, your ark and sanctuary; for in him you are safe over all floods, storms, and tempests: for he was before they were: and will be when they are all gone.</P>

<P>About this time great exercise and weights came upon me (as had usually done before great revolutions and chan∣ges of government) and my strength departed from me; so that I reeled, and was ready to fall as I went along the streets; and at length I could not go abroad at all, I was so weak for a pretty while; till I felt the power of the Lord to spring over all, and had received an assurance from him, that he would preserve his faithful people to himself through all.</P>
<P>In the time that I kept within, I wrote a paper, shewing; <Q>Moses, as a servant, was faithful in all his house, in the Old Testament; and Christ, as a Son, is over his house, in the New Testament.</Q></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE house of Israel was called God's vineyard, in Isa. v. 7. and all the Israelites were called the house of Israel. Israel signifies, <Q>a prince with God, and a prevailer with men,</Q> Gen. xxxii. 28. When Peter preach∣ed
<PB N="408" REF="037441_0924_100D94AB51BEBD68"/>Christ to the house of Israel, he said; <Q>Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,</Q> Acts ii. 36. So they were all called the house of Israel. And it is said, <Q>Moses was faithful in all his house (to wit, this house of Israel) as a servant; for a tes∣timony of those things which were to be spoken after: but Christ, as a son, over his own house; which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end,</Q> Hebr. iii. 5. 6. Here it is ma∣nifest, that Moses was faithful in all his house, as a servant, viz. in the house of Israel, in the Old Testament: but Christ Jesus, the Son of God, is over his house in his New Testament and covenant; and all his true believers are of his house. The apostle tells the Ephesians (who were a church of Christ) they were <Q>fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</Q> Eph. ii. 19. And the saints are called "the household of faith," Gal. vi. 10. Peter, in his general epistle, tells the church of Christ, they were <Q>a chosen generation, a royal priest∣hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,</Q> 1 Pet. ii. 9. And that as lively stones, they were built up <Q>a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</Q> ver. 5. The apostle saith to the church of Christ at Corinth; <Q>If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have 3 build∣ing of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 1. And Christ said to his disciples; <Q>Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe in God, be∣lieve also in me. In my Father's house are many man∣sions; (a mansion is a dwelling or abiding-place) if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also,</Q> John xiv. 1, 2, 3. The Psalmist saith; <Q>Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of our God: they shall bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing,</Q> Psal. xcii. 13, 14. Again; <Q>Holiness be∣comes thine house, O Lord, for ever,</Q> Psal. xciii. 5. Isaiah also said by way of prophecy; <Q>It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow
<PB N="409" REF="037441_0925_100D94ADD5F936B0"/>unto it,</Q> Isa. ii. 2. Is not that a great house? Is not this mountain Christ, who is over his house in the New Testament and new covenant? To this mountain and house all the children of the New Testament or new co∣venant flow in these latter days; so that it is come to pass, which was prophesied of by Isaiah. For he said; <Q>Ma∣ny people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord,</Q> ver. 3, 4, 5. Here ye may see, they that come to the mountain of the house of God, and to God's teaching, they must walk in the light of the Lord; yea, the house of Jacob. Jacob signifies a supplanter: he supplanted profane Esau, who is hated, and Jacob is loved. Now these two births must be known within: they that walk in the light of the Lord, and come to Christ, the mountain of the house of the Lord, established above all mountains and hills, break their swords into plow∣shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: and in Christ, this mountain and house of the Lord, there are no spears nor swords to hurt one another withal. Christ, the Son of God, is over his house and great family, the children of the light, that believe in it, and walk in it, the children of the day of Christ, his holy and royal priesthood, that offer up spiritual sacrifice to God by him. All such are of Christ's (the spiritual man's) house; who are born of God, and led by his Spirit: they are of the Lord of lords, and King of kings house and family, which he is over; and are of the household of the holy, divine, pure, and preci∣ous faith, which Christ is the author and finisher of. And they that be of the Son's house, are pure, righteous, and holy, and can do nothing against the truth, but for it, in their words, lives, and conversations; and so are a chosen generation, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that they should shew forth the praise of him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light. These are Christ's lively stones, that build up a spiritual house,
<PB N="410" REF="037441_0926_100D94AFD0F92F30"/>which he (Christ, the spiritual Man, the King of kings, and Lord of lords) is over.</P>

<P>Some time after this, my body continuing weak, I went with my son Mead to his house in Essex; where I staid some weeks. In which time I writ many things relating to the service of truth, some were printed soon after; others were spread abroad in manuscript; and amongst other things, a few lines to this purpose:</P>
<P><Q>THAT, while men are contending for thrones here below, Christ is on his throne, and all his holy an∣gels are about him, who is the beginning and the ending, the first and last, over all. And that the Lord will make way and room for himself, and for them that are born of his Spirit, which are heavenly Jerusalem's children, to come home to their free mother.</Q></P>
<P>A few words also I writ concerning the world's teachers, and the emptiness of their teaching. Which were thus:</P>
<P><Q>DOTH not that which is called Christendom live in talking of Christ's, of the apostles, and prophets words, and the letter of the Scriptures? And do not their priests minister the letter, with their own conceptions thereupon, for money, though the holy Scriptures were freely given forth from God, Christ, the prophets, and apostles? Yet the apostle saith, <Q>The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,</Q> 2 Cor. iii. 6. The ministers of the New Testament are not ministers of the letter, but of the Spirit, and they sow to the Spirit, and of the Spirit reap life eternal. But people's spending time about old authors, and talking of them, and of the outward letter, doth not feed their souls. For talking of victuals and clothes doth not clothe the body, nor feed it. No more are their souls and spirits fed and clothed, except they have the bread and water of life from heaven to feed them, and the righteousness of Christ to clothe them. Talking of out∣ward things and spiritual things, and not possessing them, may starve both their bodies and their souls. Therefore
<PB N="411" REF="037441_0927_100D94B21016AAE8"/>quench not the spirit of God, which will lead to be di∣ligent in all things.</Q></P>
<P>With this I writ another short paper, shewing, <Q>The hurt they did, and the danger they run into, who turned people from the inward manifestation of Christ in the heart.</Q></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Jews were commanded by the law of God, "not to remove the outward landmark," Deut. xix. 14. They that did so, or that caused the blind to wander, were cursed in the old covenant, Deut. xxvii. 17. In the new covenant the apostle saith; <Q>Let him be accursed that preacheth any other gospel, than that which he had preached,</Q> Gal. i. 8. The gospel that he preached was <Q>the power of God unto salvation, to every one that be∣lieveth,</Q> Rom. i. 16. And the gospel that was preached to Abraham was, That in his <Q>seed all nations, and all the families of the earth should be blessed.</Q> In order to bring men to this blessed state, God poureth out of his Spirit upon all flesh; and Christ doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world; and the grace of God, which bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men, and teach∣eth Christians, the true believers in Christ, and God doth write his law in the true Christians hearts, and putteth it in their minds, that they may <Q>all know the Lord, from the greatest to the least;</Q> and he giveth his word in their hearts to obey and do, and the anointing within them; so that they need not any man to teach them, but as the anointing doth teach them. Now all such as turn people from the light, Spirit, grace, word, and anointing within, remove them from the heavenly land-mark of their eternal inheritance, and make them blind, and cause the blind to wander from the living way to their eternal house in the heavens, and from the new and heavenly Jerusalem. So they are cursed that cause the blind to wander out of their way, and remove them from their heavenly land-mark.</P>

Abraham, the father of the faithful, was an husbandman, and had great flocks of cattle; just Lot was an husbandman, and had great flocks and herds, Gen. xiii.

Jacob was an husband∣man, and his sons "keepers of flocks of cattle," Gen. xlvi. 32. 34. and God loved Jacob. Moses kept sheep, Exod. iii. 1. The Lord spake to him, when he was keeping sheep, ver. 4. and sent him to Pharaoh, to bring God's people, or sheep, out of Egypt. And by the hand and power of the Lord, he and Aaron his brother brought them out of Egypt, a land of anguish, bondage, darkness, and perplexity. And Moses kept the Lord's people, or sheep, forty years in the wilderness: a meek shepherd of God he was, and kept his great flock of sheep; though some of them were scabbed with the leprosy of contention and murmuring, and were destroyed in the wilderness.</P>
<P>David (though he afterwards came to be a king) was a keeper of his father's sheep in the wilderness, 1 Sam. xvii. 15. 28. The Lord called him from the sheep-cotes to feed his sheep, the house of Israel, and to defend them from the spiritual wolves, bears, and lions; and he did it to purpose, who was a man after God's own heart.</P>
<P>Elisha was a plowman, 1 Kings xix. 19. He was cal∣led from the plow, to teach God's people, the children of Israel, to plow up the fallow-ground of their hearts, that they might bring forth seed and fruits to God their Creator.</P>
<P>The word of the Lord came to Amos, when he was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, Amos i. 1. Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, said to Amos. <Q>Prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court,</Q> chap. vii. 13. Amos answered <Q>I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son: but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycamore-fruit; and the Lord took me as I followed the flock. And the Lord said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel,</Q> ver. 14.15. Here ye may see, the Lord made use of a poor
<PB N="413" REF="037441_0929_100D94B6F086CE48"/>man, and called him from following the outward flock, and from gathering of outward fruits, to gather his fruits, and to follow his people or flock, the children of Israel.</P>
<P>Christ called Peter, and Andrew his brother, when <Q>casting their net into the sea (for they were fishers): and he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fish∣ers of men,</Q> Matth. iv. 18, 19. Christ likewise called James and John his brother, when they were in a ship, with Zebedee their father, <Q>mending their nets; and they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed him,</Q> ver. 21. 22. He gave them power (a net that will hold, and not want mending) and made them fishers of men, to fish them out of the great sea, the world of wickedness. We read, when Peter, Thomas, Nathaniel, the sons of Zebedee, and other disciples went a fishing to∣gether, and that night caught nothing, in the morning Je∣sus appeared, and said, <Q>Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</Q> They did so, and catched so great a multitude, they were not able to draw them to the shore. When thereupon one of the other disciples said to Peter, "It is the Lord;" Peter, hearing that, <Q>girded his fisher's coat unto him,</Q> John xxi. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This was after Christ was risen.

<P>Jesus saw Matthew <Q>sitting at the receipt of custom, and he said unto him, follow me. And he arose, and fol∣lowed him,</Q> Matth. ix. 9.

His power is certain and doth not change, by which he doth remove the mountains and hills, and shakes the heavens and the earth. Leaky, dis∣honourable vessels, the hills and mountains, and the old heavens and the earth, are all to be shaken, removed, and broken to pieces, though they do not see it nor him that doth it; but the elect and faithful both see it, and know him and his power that cannot be shaken, and changeth not.</P>

<P>About the middle of the first month, 1688-9, I went to London, the parliament then sitting, and being then about the bill of indulgence.

I am glad to hear friends are well in all those provinces and places every where, except Dantzick, and that you were so diligent in spreading my papers to the strengthening of friends. I have lately printed the Life of William Caton, but have not made a collection of his books.

<P>Concerning friends at Dantzick, whom the Lord hath supported with his eternal arm and power to this day, I hope by the same arm and power he will support them, and in it they will feel his blessed presence with them in all their sufferings; who is over the cruelty of their perse∣cutors, who will hardly let them breathe outwardly or in∣wardly, in the common air of their native soil. Which shews their immorality, inhumanity, and unchristianity, and that they want the counsel of a Gamaliel amongst them; whose actions are below the law of God, to <Q>do unto others as they would have others do unto them;</Q> God will not bless the doings of such. However I desire that friends may mind the Lord's power that is over all, be valiant for his truth, and keep upon their rock and foundation Christ Jesus, that stands sure in the time of the heat of persecution which is so hot upon you, that they will not suffer you to have so much as your houses to work and sleep in, nor to meet nor serve God in. The Lord beholds all such actors and their actions. Therefore look over all to him, who is able to deal with them, and reward them according to their works. God Almighty preserve you all in Christ Jesus, in whom you have rest, life and peace, Amen.</P>

<P>WE have seen your order, and your breathing out persecution against that little flock, the lambs of Christ, that live under your jurisdiction in the city of Dantzick, and that you have imprisoned and banished two by the hangman out of the government of your city; and others you threaten to do the same to, with great punish∣ment if they return. Likewise you threaten those with punishment they rent their houses of, if they let them have their houses either to live in, or meet in to serve and worship the Lord that made them. Truly, I am heartily sorry for both your magistrates and priests, that go under the name of Christians, and shew such immoral, inhu∣man, unchristian actions, below the royal law of God, which is <Q>to do to others as you would have them do unto you.</Q> For would you think it was moral, human, or christian, or according to the law of God, if the king of Poland, who is of another religion than you, should banish you out of your city by the hangman, and call you murderers of souls? Could you say but this was according to the law of God, <Q>to do unto you as you would have done unto others?</Q> If you say, you have the sword, the horn, and the power: blessed be the Lord that hath short∣ened your sword, your power, and your horn, that it reaches no further than your jurisdiction of Dantzick: and you do not know how long God may suffer you to have your horn, your power and your sword. We are sure you have not the mind nor Spirit of Christ; and the apos∣tle saith, <Q>They that have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his,</Q> Rom. viii. And Christ bids Peter <Q>put up his sword;</Q> they that draw the sword concerning him, to defend him and his worship and faith, should perish with the sword. Peter and the apostles never drew the outward sword after, but said, their weapons were spiritual not carnal, and they did not wrestle with flesh and blood. Christ never gave any such command, that they should banish any by the hangman, that were not of their religion, nor would not receive it. Are not you worse than the Turks, who let many religions be in their country, yea
<PB N="417" REF="037441_0933_100D94BE96C97348"/>Christians, and to meet peaceably? Yea, the Turkish patroons let our friends that were captives meet together at Algiers, and said, "It was good so to do." You are worse than those barbarous people at Salee, who do not profess Christianity; for you profess Christ in words, but in works deny him. Did you ever find, either in scrip∣ture or history, that any persecutors prospered long? You are worse than they are in the Mogul's country, who they say permits sixty religions in his dominions; and many others might be mentioned, which you are worse than them all in your cruelty and persecution of God's people only for meeting together in the name of Jesus, and serv∣ing and worshipping God, their Creator. No, they must not breathe in their natural air, neither natural or spiritu∣al, in your dominions. I pray, where had you these commands from? Neither from Christ nor his apostles. Do not you profess the scriptures of the New Testament to be your rule? But I pray you, what scripture have you for this practice? It is good for you to be humble, to do justice, love mercy, call home your banished, and love and cherish them; yea, though they were your ene∣mies, you are to obey the command of Christ, and love them. I wonder how you and your wives and families can sleep quietly in your beds, that do such cruel actions, without thinking the "Lord may do to you the same!" You cannot be without sense and feeling, except you be given over to reprobation, and your consciences seared with a hot iron. But Christian charity doth hope that you are not all in that state; but that there may be some relenting or consideration of your actions among some of you, either according to the law of God or his gospel.</P>
<P>From him that desires your temporal and eternal good and salvation, and not destruction, Amen.</P>

Having staid in the country about three weeks, I return∣ed to London a little before the yearly meeting, which was in the third month this year, and was a very solemn, weighty meeting; the Lord, as formerly, visiting his peo∣ple, and honouring the assembly with his glorious presence, to the great satisfaction and comfort of friends. After the business of the meeting was over, it was upon me to add a few lines to the epistle, which went from the meeting to friends, after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO have known the Lord's eternal arm and power, that hath preserved you upon the heavenly rock and foundation, and hath built your house upon it; you have known many winds, tempests, and storms that have risen out of the sea, where the beast rose, and many raging storms that have risen by apostates of several sorts; but the seed that bruises the serpent's head, and is the founda∣tion of God's people, stands sure. Dear friends and bre∣thren, though there be great shakings in the world, the Lord's power is over all, and his kingdom cannot be shaken. Therefore, all ye children of God, children of the light, and heirs of his kingdom, a joyful, peaceable habitation keep in; keeping out of all the heats, conten∣tions. and disputes about things below. <Q>Lay hand on no man, nor nothing suddenly,</Q> lest they should be puf∣fed up with that which fades, and so come to loss; but mind the Lord's power that keeps open your heavenly eye, to see things present and to come, and in that ye will see and handle the word of life. Dear friends every where, have power over your own spirits. As God hath blessed you with his outward things, have a care of trusting in them, or falling into difference one with another about these outward things that are below, which will pass away. But all live in the love of God, and in that live in peace with God, and one with another. Follow the works of charity, and overcome the evil with the good to all; for what good have all the tinklers done, with their cymbals and sounding brass? They always bred confusion, and never did good in any age; tinkling with their cymbals, and sounding with their brass, to draw out the simple to follow them. It is good for all the children of God to keep in their possessions of life, and in the love of God that is everlasting. As for all the tumults of the world,
<PB N="419" REF="037441_0935_100D94C39E4D7DF8"/>and the apostates from the truth, the Lord's power is over them all, Christ reigns, and the Lord saith, <Q>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper,</Q> Isa. liv. 17. Friends, you are not insensible how many weapons have been formed against us who are sons and daughters of God, and the Lord hath restrained them according to his promise; they "have not prospered." The Lord said, <Q>Every tongue that shall rise up in judgment against thee, thou shalt condemn;</Q> so God hath given such a power to his children to condemn all the tongues that shall rise up in judgment against them, and this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, "Their righteousness is of me," saith the Lord. You are not insensible of the many tongues that have risen up against us in judgment, yea of apostates and prophane; but in and with the truth, the power of God, according to the promise of God, <Q>Every tongue that riseth against thee thou shalt condemn,</Q> It is not one tongue only thou shalt condemn; but every tongue that shall rise up in judgment against thee thou shalt condemn. The Lord giveth this power to his ser∣vants and children to judge the evil tongues, and he doth restrain the weapons formed against them, so that they shall not prosper against his children that he hath begotten. Praises and honour be to his holy name for ever! Amen!</P>

<P>Soon after this the yearly meeting began at York, which, because of the largeness of that county, and for the conve∣niency of friends in the northern parts, had for some years been held there. And inasmuch as there had been some hurt done in that place, by some that were gone out of the unity of friends, it was upon me to write a few lines to that meeting, to <Q>exhort them to keep in pure heavenly love, which brings into and keeps in the true unity.</Q> Which was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Dear friends and brethren in Christ Jesus,</P>
<P>WHOM the Lord by his eternal arm and power hath preserved to this day, all walk in the power and Spirit of God, that is over all, in love and unity; for love overcomes, builds up, and unites all the members of Christ to him the Head. Love keeps out of all strife, and is of God. Love, or charity, never fails, but keeps the mind 'above all outward things, and strife about outward things.
<PB N="420" REF="037441_0936_100D94C5A48384D8"/>It overcomes evil, and casts out all false fears. It is of God, and unites all the hearts of his people together in the heavenly joy, concord, and unity. The God of love preserve you all, and establish you in Christ Jesus, your life and salvation, in whom ye have all peace with God. So walk in him, that ye may be ordered in his peaceable, heavenly wisdom, to the glory of God, and the comfort one of another, Amen.</P>

<P>Being much wearied and spent with many large meet∣ings, and much business with friends during the time of the yearly meeting, and finding my health much impaired there∣by, I went out of town with my daughter Rouse to their country-house near Kingston, and tarried there most of the remaining part of the summer. In which time I sometimes visited friends at Kingston, and wrote divers things for the service of truth and friends. One was an epistle to friends at Barbadoes; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all friends in Barbadoes that are convinced of God's truth.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY desires are that ye may live and walk in his peace∣able truth, and shew forth that ye are children of the light and of the truth; for the heavenly, gentle, peaceable wisdom is justified of her children. But debate, strife, wilfulness, laying open one another's nakedness and weak∣ness, is not the practice of heavenly wisdom's children (but of Ham's) nor from the Spirit of Christ; neither such as bite and tear one another; that is from a devouring spirit, not the Spirit of Jesus, which covers that which is uncome∣ly, and can forgive. My friends, you profess that truth which is beyond all the world's ways, therefore see that you excel them in the heavenly gentle wisdom, that is ea∣sy to be intreated; for the wisdom of the world is not easy to be intreated, and sometimes will not be intreated at all. Pray see you excel the world in wisdom, in virtue, in kind∣ness, in love that is over hatred, in meekness, humility, sobriety, civility, and modesty, in temperance and pati∣ence, and in all morality and humanity; which will not act any thing below men nor unmanly. Shew forth true
<PB N="421" REF="037441_0937_100D94C86E0F0BD0"/>christianity, and that ye are the converted and translated believers in Christ, dwelling in the love of God that bear∣eth all things, endureth all things, is not puffed up, and envies not. For they that are out of this love of God, and Christian charity, are nothing but as a tinkling cym∣bal and as sounding brass, and are discontented, murmur∣ers and complainers, full of doubts, questions, and false jealousies. Keep that spirit out of the camp of God: for do not you read in the scriptures, both of the New and Old Testament, that the end of such was misery? There∣fore, in the love of God, build up one another; for love edifies the body of Christ, and he commands his believers to love enemies, and to love one another; by this they are known to be the disciples of Christ. But to live in envy, strife, and hatred, is a mark that they are no disci∣ples of Christ; <Q>for he that loveth not his brother abides in death, and whosoever hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. But they that love the brethren are passed from death to life,</Q> 1 John iii. 14, 15. And, <Q>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen? And this command∣ment have we from God, that he who loveth God loves his brother also,</Q> chap. iv. 20, 21. Therefore <Q>love one another;</Q> for love is of God, and hatred is of the de∣vil, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knows God. All are children of God by creation, therefore in that state they are to love their neighbours as themselves, and <Q>to do unto all men as they would have them do unto them.</Q> Secondly, God pouring his Spirit upon all flesh (or all men and women) all that are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God, heirs of God, and joint∣heirs with Christ, and are in fellowship in the everlasting gospel, and in unity in the Spirit, the bond of peace. They that go out of this unity, out of the bond of peace, and do not keep it, break the King of kings peace; but they that keep in the unity and fellowship in the Spirit, and walk in the light, have fellowship one with another, and with the Father and the Son. It is not every one that talks of the light of the world, of righteousness, of Christ, and of God, but he that "doth the will of God." There∣fore my friends, strive to excel one another in love, in virtue, in good life and conversation; and strive all to be
<PB N="422" REF="037441_0938_100D94CA91F749F8"/>of one mind, heart, and judgment in the Spirit of God; for in Christ all are one, and are in peace with him. The Lord God Almighty preserve you in him, your rock and foundation, that is heavenly and stands sure; that ye may be valiant for the truth upon earth, for the Lord and his glorious name; that ye may all serve him in your genera∣tion, and in his new creation in Christ Jesus, Amen.</P>
<P>And now that you are come into so much favour with the magistrates and powers, that they let you serve the office of a constable, &amp;c. without swearing or taking any oaths, hereby Christ's doctrine and command, and his apostle's is set up. I therefore desire that you may double your diligence in your offices, in doing that which is just, true, and righteous; so that ye may excel and exceed all that are tied or bound by oaths to perform their offices; and you can do it upon your Yea and Nay; so say and so do, according to Christ's doctrine and command. For Adam and Eve, by disobeying the command of God, fell under condemnation; and they that disobey the command of Christ, in taking oaths and swearing, go into evil, and fall into condemnation, Mat. v. and James v. My love in the Lord is to you all.</P>

<P>I staid at Kingston till the beginning of the seventh month, where not only friends came to visit me, but some considerable people of the world, with whom I discoursed about the things of God. Then leaving Kingston, I went to London by water, visiting friends as I went, and taking Hammersmith-meeting in my way. Having recovered some strength by being in the country, when I was come to Lon∣don I went from meeting to meeting, labouring diligently in the work of the Lord, and opening the divine mysteries of the heavenly things, as God in his Spirit opened them to me. But I found my body would not long bear the city; wherefore, when I had travelled amongst friends there about a month, I went to Tottenham-High-Cross, and from thence to Edward Man's country-house near Winchmore-hill and to Enfield; spending three weeks amongst friends thereabouts, and had meetings at all those places. Then, being a little refreshed in the country, I returned to Lon∣don; where I tarried, labouring in the work of the ministry,
<PB N="423" REF="037441_0939_100D94CC24B6C9D8"/>till the middle of the ninth month; at which time I went with my son Mead to his house in Essex, and abode there all the winter. During which time I stirred not much abroad, unless sometimes to the meeting to which that fa∣mily belonged, which was about half a mile from thence; but I had meetings often in the house with the family and those friends that came thither. Many things also I wrote while I was there, some of which follow. One was an epistle to the quarterly and yearly meetings of friends in Pennsylvania, New-England, Virginia, Maryland, the Jer∣seys, Carolina, and other plantations in America. Which was thus:</P>
<Q><P>My dear friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ, WHO, by believing in his light, are become children of his light and of his day; my desires are, that you may all walk in the light and in the day, and keep the feast of Christ, our passover, who is sacrificed for us, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but let all that be purged out, that ye may be a new lump, keeping the feast of Christ, our passover, with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Let no leavened bread be found in your houses, nor in your meetings, nor in the camp of God, or household of faith, which are the household of Christ; but all that sour, old leaven, which makes people's hearts sour, and burn one against another, must be purged out of the camp of God, and kept out. For the feast of Christ, our passover, must be kept in the New Covenant with his heavenly unlea∣vened bread of life. The Jews feast in the Old Testament was kept with outward unleavened bread; and now in the New Testament, in the gospel-day, our feast is to be kept with the heavenly unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Therefore friends, I desire you seriously to consider, and to keep this feast which the apostle directed the church of Christ to keep. Do not you see Christendom, so called, keep their feasts with the leavened bread of malice and wickedness? which makes them so sour, and their hearts so to burn one against another, that they have destroyed, and do destroy one another about religion. Therefore all live in the love of God, which keeps above the love of the world; so that none of your hearts may be choaked or surfeited with these outward things, or with the cares of the world which will pass away; but mind ye the world
<PB N="424" REF="037441_0940_100D94CDD5908200"/>and the life that is without end, that ye may be heirs of it. And, friends, you should strive to excel all, both professor and prophane, in morality, humanity, and Christianity, modesty, sobriety, and moderation, and in a good, godly, righteous life and conversation; shewing forth the fruits of the Spirit of God and that you are the children of the living God, children of light and of day, and not of the night. And serve God in newness of life; for it is the life, and a living and walking in the truth, that must an∣swer the witness of God in all people, <Q>that they, seeing our good works, may glorify our Father which is in hea∣ven.</Q> Therefore be valiant for God's holy pure truth, and spread it abroad among both professors and prophane, and the Indians. And you should write over once a year, from all your yearly meetings, to the yearly meeting here, concerning your diligence in the truth, and of its spread∣ing, and of people's receiving it, both professors and pro∣phane, and the Indians; and concerning the peace of the church of Christ amongst yourselves. For, blessed be the Lord, truth doth get ground in these parts, many are made very loving to friends, and the Lord's power and seed is over all: in which God Almighty keep all his peo∣ple to his glory, Amen.</P>

<P>While I was in the city I had a concern upon my spirit with respect to a twofold danger that attended some who professed truth; one was of young people's running into the fashions of the world, and the other was of old people's go∣ing into the earth. And that concern coming now again weightily upon me, I was moved to give forth the follow∣ing as a reproof to such, and an exhortation and warning to all friends to beware of and keep out of those snares.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all that profess the truth of God.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY desires are that you walk humbly in it; for when the Lord first called me forth, he let me see that young people grew up together in vanity and the fashions of the world, and old people went downwards into the earth, raking it together; and to both these I was to be a stranger. And now, friends, I do see too many young
<PB N="425" REF="037441_0941_100D94D02A092B60"/>people that profess the truth grow up into the fashions of the world, and too many parents indulge them; and amongst the elder some are declining downwards and rak∣ing after the earth. Therefore, take heed that you are not making your graves while you are alive outwardly, and loading yourselves with thick clay, Hab. ii. 6. For if you have not power over the earthly Spirit, and that which leadeth into a vain mind, and the fashions of the world, and into the earth; though you have often had the rain fall upon your fields, you will but bring forth thistles, briers, and thorn, which are for the fire. Such will be∣come brittle, peevish, fretful spirits, that will not abide the heavenly doctrine, the admonitions, exhortations, and reproofs of the Holy Ghost, or heavenly Spirit of God; which would bring you to be conformable to the death of Christ, and to his image, that ye might have fellowship with him in his resurrection. Therefore it is good for all to bow to the name of Jesus, their Saviour, that all may confess him to the glory of God the Father. For I have had a concern upon me, in a sense of the danger of young people's going into the fashions of the world, and old peo∣ple's going into the earth, and many going into a loose and false liberty, till at last they go quite out into the spi∣rit of the world as some have done. The house of such hath been built upon the sand on the sea-shore, not upon Christ the Rock; that are so soon in the world again, un∣der a pretence of liberty of conscience. But it is not a pure conscience, nor in the Spirit of God, nor in Christ Jesus; for in the liberty in the Spirit there is the unity, which is the bond of peace; and all are one in Christ Jesus, in whom is the true liberty: and this is not of the world, for he is not of the world. Therefore all are to stand fast in him, as they have received him; for in him there is peace, who is the Prince of Peace, but in the world there is trouble. For the spirit of the world is a troublesome spirit, but the Spirit of Christ is a peaceable Spirit: in which God Almighty preserve all the faithful, Amen.</P>

<P>Another I wrote while I was here concerning the Ensign which Isaiah prophesied the Lord should set up for the
<PB N="426" REF="037441_0942_100D94D35E179148"/>Gentiles, which I shewed was Christ. Of which follows a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord saith, <Q>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea,</Q> Isa. xi. 9. <Q>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious,</Q> ver. 10. <Q>And he shall reign over the Gentiles, and in him shall the Gentiles trust,</Q> Rom. xv. 12. This Ensign is Christ, who was prophesied of by the prophet; which prophecy the apostle, who was a minister to the Gentiles, sheweth was fulfilled in the New Testament. In this day of Christ, Isaiah saith, <Q>The Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria and from Egypt, &amp;c. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dis∣persed of Judah from the four corners of the earth,</Q> ver. 11, 12. This is in the day of Christ, and his gospel of life and salvation, which is preached to every creature un∣der heaven, who <Q>enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> both Jews and Gentiles, that by his hea∣venly divine light they may see Christ, their Ensign and Captain of their salvation; so Christ is one Ensign both to the Jews and Gentiles. Isaiah saith, <Q>The Redeemer shall come to Sion,</Q> &amp;c. Isa. lix. 20. And, <Q>This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee (to wit, Christ) and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever,</Q> ver. 21. <Q>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee,</Q> chap. lxi. 1. "And the Gentiles shall come to thy light," ver. 3. <Q>And the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto three,</Q> ver. 5. (the sea is the world). <Q>The Lord shall be thy ever∣lasting light,</Q> ver. 20. And, <Q>Thou shalt call thy walls, salvation, and thy gates, praise,</Q> ver. 18. And the Lord saith, "I will make the place of my feet glorious," ver. 13. "Heaven is his throne, and earth is his footstool," chap. lxvi. 1. <Q>And he that puts his trust in me, saith the Lord, shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy
<PB N="427" REF="037441_0943_100D94D4F2AB3B30"/>mountain,</Q> chap. lvii. 13. Which mountain is esta∣blished above all the mountains and hills, Isa. ii. 2. The Lord saith (speaking of Christ) <Q>I have put my spirit up∣on him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles,</Q> Isa. xlii. 1. <Q>I will give thee for a covenant of the peo∣ple, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness, out of the prison-house. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images,</Q> ver. 6, 7, 8. So Christ the Light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri∣sen, and the Gentiles are come to the light of Christ. This prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ, many of the Gen∣tiles witness fulfilled, that <Q>salvation is come to the Gen∣tiles,</Q> Rom. xi. 11. God gave his glory to his son; and Christ saith, <Q>The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them (namely his believers and followers) that they may be one, even as we are one,</Q> John xvii. 22. Here you may see the promises and prophecies are fulfil∣led in Christ Jesus, whom God hath given for an Ensign both to the Jews and Gentiles, and the Captain of their Salvation; and he doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world: that with his heavenly divine light they might see Christ, the Lord from heaven, their Captain and Ensign, and trust in him, their Conqueror; who bruises the serpent's head, and destroys the devil and his works: and Christ and his followers overcome the dragon, beast, and false prophet. Therefore all Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, that come to believe in Christ, are to stand to their Ensign, Christ, who is also the Captain of their Salvation, above all ensigns and captains below, for he is from above; therefore all are to trust in him, for he is certain and able to save to the utmost. He is the same Ensign and Captain to-day as he was yesterday, and so for ever, the First and Last, the Beginning and Ending, the Lord of lords, and King of all kings upon the earth; and there is nothing certain to be trusted in below Christ Jesus who is from above. You see in the scriptures, there were many ways and religions among the heathen, as there were many sects among the Jews when Christ came; and now there are many sects or religions among the Christians, who believe from the scriptures "that he is come," as the Jews believed "he was to come." But they that close their eyes, and stop their ears to the light of Christ, are
<PB N="428" REF="037441_0944_100D94D7590B8790"/>not like to see Christ who hath enlightened them, to be their Ensign and the Captain of their Salvation, that see not with the heavenly eye, nor hear with the heavenly ear, to see and hear their heavenly Ensign and Captain of their Salvation, to convert and heal them; that they might follow him, and be of his holy camp, his heavenly sol∣diers, to whom he gives spiritual arms and armour, the helmet of salvation, the breast-plate of righteousness, the armour of light, and the shield of faith, (which will quench all the fiery darts of Satan and give victory) and the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, which shall cut, hammer down, and burn up all the strong holds of Satan. Also he clotheth his soldiers with fine linen, white and clean, his righteousness, and shoeth them with the everlasting gospel of peace, the power of God; which clothes and shoes will never wax old. And all that are shod with the everlasting gospel, the power of God, will never wax old; but will stand all storms and tempests in the world. They that are shod with the gospel, the power of God, can in it tread upon serpents, vipers, and scorpions, and all the veno∣mous beasts upon the earth, and all the thorns, briers, bram∣bles, thistles, sharp rocks, and mountains, and never be hurt, nor never wear out their shoes; for their feet were al∣ways beautiful upon the mountains. Moses, a captain, the servant of the Lord, said unto the people of Israel, <Q>I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot,</Q> Deut. xxix. 5. Here ye may see, the Jews in the Old Testament, their clothes and their shoes did not wax old: but they, who are Christ's follow∣ers, whom he snoeth with his everlasting gospel of peace, and clotheth with his fine linen, his righteousness, and arms with his armour, are clothed, shod, and armed, with that which will never decay, wax old, canker, rust, cor∣rupt, nor grow blunt. Now all (whether Christians, or Jews, or Gentiles) that hate the light of Christ, close their eyes, and stop their ears to it, are not like to see Christ their ensign and captain of their salvation, but are blind. As no outward captain would list a company of blind and deaf men, and clothe and arm them with outward armmour, to such as are blind and deaf, whose eyes are closed, and care slopped to the heavenly light of Christ, he is not like to clothe with his sine linen, and arm with his heavenly and spiritual armour; nor are they like to be spiritually
<PB N="429" REF="037441_0945_100D94D9AA33D540"/>and heavenly disciplined, and to see and know his holy, spiritual, living camp, nor to follow him, while they are deaf and blind, and hate his light, which is the life in Christ. For it is the light, that shines in the heart, which gives the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus; who is the ensign and captain of men's sal∣vations, and who hath brought, and doth bring many sons unto glory: praises, honour, and glory be unto the Lord over all, who liveth for ever, Amen.</P>

<P>A week after this I returned to London; and after a little stay there, went to visit friends at Kingston, where I staid not long; but came back to London, and remained in the Lord's work, till after the yearly meeting, which was in the fourth month this year; in which the wonted goodness of the Lord was witnessed, his blessed presence enjoyed, and his heavenly power livingly felt, opening the hearts of his people unto him, and his divine treasures of life and wisdom in and unto them; whereby many useful and necessary things, relating to the safety of friends, and to the honour and prosperity of truth, were weightily treated of, and una∣nimously concluded.</P>

<PB N="430" REF="037441_0946_100D94DCA4C1C270"/>Son, full of grace and truth: who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him. Whose name is above every name under the whole heaven, and all his living members know, there is no salvation given by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Jesus; and he, their salvation, and their living head, is felt in the midst of them in his light, life, spirit, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and truth, and his word of patience, wisdom, and power: who is his peo∣ple's prophet, that God hath raised up, in his New Testa∣ment and covenant, to open to them; and their living shepherd, that hath purchased, redeemed, and bought them with his precious blood. Christ, the living One, feeds his living sheep in his living pastures of life, and his living sheep know their living shepherd's voice, with his living bread and water, and follow him; and will not fol∣low any of the world's hirelings, nor thieves, nor robbers, nor climbers, that are without Christ, the door. Likewise Christ's living children know Christ, the bishop of their souls, to oversee them with his heavenly and spiritual eye, that they may be preserved in his fold of life, and go no more forth. Also they know Christ, their holy priest, that by the grace of God tasted death for them, and for every man, and is a propitiation for their sins; and not for theirs only, but for the sins of the whole world: and by the one offering up of himself he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Such an high-priest be∣comes Christ's sheep in his new covenant and testament, who is holy, harmless, and separate from sinners, and is made higher than the heavens; who is not made a priest after the order of Aaron with his tithes, offerings, &amp;c. but he makes an end of all those things, having abolished them, and is made an high-priest after the power of an endless life, who ever liveth to make intercession for his people; and is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God through him. He is the one holy mediator betwixt God and man, who sanctifies his people, his church, that he is head of, and presents them to God without spot, or wrin∣kle, or blemish, or any such thing; and makes them an holy, royal priesthood, to offer up spiritual, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, who is King of all kings, and Lord of all lords in the earth. So an holy, heavenly king, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; and rules in all the hearts of his sheep and lambs by his holy, divine, precious faith, that is held in
<PB N="431" REF="037441_0947_100D94DE3AC7DA00"/>all the pure consciences of his people: which holy faith, Christ, the holy one, is the author and finisher of. By this holy faith all the just live, in which holy, divine, pre∣cious faith all the just and holy ones have unity; and by it quench all the fiery darts of Satan; and have access to the pure God, in which they please him. Christ, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, in his New Testament and new covenant, is the minister of the sanctuary and true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. Therefore all the lambs and sheep of Christ must feel this holy minister in their temple and sanctuary, who ministers spiritual, holy, and heavenly things to them in their sanctuary and tabernacle. For all the tabernacles and sanctuaries, that are built or pitch'd by man, men make ministers for them; and such ministers are of men and by men, with their worldly sanctuaries and tabernacles of men's pitching, by men's hands.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends and brethren every where, that are of the flock of Christ: Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. Therefore let us all keep this heavenly feast of our passover in his new testament and covenant, not with old leaven, neither of malice nor wickedness; but let all that be purged out, with the sour old leavened bread, that all may become a new lump: and so keep this heavenly feast of Christ, our heavenly Passover, with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, Amen.</P>

<P>I staid in town between three weeks and a month, after the yearly meeting, and then went to Tottenham-High∣Cross, where was a meeting on first-day, which I was at; and then went to Edward Man's at Ford-Green near Winchmore-Hill: and the first-day following to the meet∣ing at Enfield; where the Lord gave me many precious openings to declare to the people. Afterwards, moving to and fro amongst friends thereabouts, I visited the meetings at Chesshunt, Waltham-Abbey, Enfield, Tottenham, and Winchmore-Hill frequently; the Lord being with me, and opening many deep and weighty truths, divine and heaven∣ly mysteries to his people through me, to their great re∣freshment, and my joy. After some time I went to Hert∣ford, to visit friends there; and was at their meeting on a first-day. And having something more particular upon me to the ancient friends of that place, I had a meeting with
<PB N="432" REF="037441_0948_100D94DFD896BD20"/>some of them the next day, and imparted to them what the Lord had given me for them. Then passing to Ware, I made a little stay amongst friends there, and was at their meeting. After which, returning, amongst friends about Edmonton side and Tottenham, and taking meetings as I went, I came back to London in the end of the seventh month.</P>
<P>I remained at London till the beginning of the ninth month, being continually exercised in the work of the Lord, either in publick meetings, opening the way of truth to peo∣ple, and building up and establishing friends therein, or in other services relating to the church of God. For the par∣liament now sitting, and having a bill before them concern∣ing oaths, and another concerning clandestine marriages, several friends did attend the house, to get those bills so worded, that they might not be hurtful to friends. In this service I also assisted, attending on the parliament, and dis∣coursing the matter with several of the members.</P>
<P>Having staid more than a month in London, and much spent myself in these services, I went to Tottenham, and some time after to Ford-Green. At which places I con∣tinued several weeks, visiting friends meetings round about at Tottenham, Enfield, and Winchmore-Hill. In this time several things came upon me to write: whereof one was an epistle "to friends in the ministry;" as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends in the ministry every where, to whom God hath given a gift of the ministry, and who use to travel up and down in the gift of the ministry, do not <Q>hide your talent, nor put your light under a bushel; nor cumber yourselves, nor entangle yourselves with the af∣fairs of this world.</Q> For the natural soldiers are not to cumber themselves with the world; much less the soldiers of Christ, who are not of this world; but are to mind the riches and glory of the world that is everlasting. There∣fore stir up the gift of God in you, improve it, and do not sit down, Demas like, and embrace this present world, that will have an end; lest ye become idolaters. Be va∣liant for God's truth upon the earth, and spread it abroad in the day-light of Christ, you who have sought the king∣dom of God, and the righteousness thereof, and have re∣ceived it and preached it; which <Q>stands in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost:</Q> As able minis∣ters of the Spirit sow to the Spirit, that of the Spirit ye
<PB N="433" REF="037441_0949_100D94E3AAB11B90"/>may reap life everlasting. Go on in the Spirit, plowing with it in the purifying hope; and threshing, with the power and Spirit of God, the wheat out of the chaff of corruption, in the same hope. For he that looks back from the spiritual plow into the world, is not fit for the spiritual and everlasting kingdom of God; and is not like to press into it, as the faithful do. Therefore you that are awakened to righteousness, and to the knowledge of the truth, keep yourselves awakened in it: then the enemy cannot sow his tares in your field; for truth and righteous∣ness is over him, and before he was. My desires are, that all may fulfil their ministry, that the Lord Jesus Christ hath committed to them; and then by the blood (or life) and testimony of Jesus you will overcome the enemy that opposes it, within and without. All you that preach the truth, do it as it is in Jesus, in love; and all that are believers in Jesus, and receivers of him, he gives them power to become the Sons of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; whom he calleth brethren; and he gives them the water of life, which shall be a well in them, springing up to eternal life; that they may water the spi∣ritual plants of the living God. So that all may be spirit∣ual planters, and spiritual waterers; and may see with the spiritual eye the everlasting, eternal God over all to give the increase, who is the insinite fountain. My desires are, that you may be kept out of all the beggarly elements of the world, which is below the spiritual region, to Christ the head; and may hold him, who bruiseth the head of enmity, and was before it was; that ye may all be united together in love, in your head, Christ, and be ordered by his heavenly, gentle, peaceable wisdom to the glory of God. For all that be in Christ, are in love, peace, and unity. In him they are strong, and in a full persuasion; and in him, who is the first and last, they are in a heaven∣ly resolution and considence for God's everlasting honour and glory, Amen.</P>
<P>From him, who is translated into the kingdom of his dear Son, with all his saints, a heavenly salutation. And salute one another with a holy kiss of charity, that never fail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th.</P>

Another epistle I wrote soon after, more particularly to the friends in the ministry, that were gone into America: after this manner.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren, ministers, exhorters, and admonishers, that are gone into America and the islands thereaway. Stir up the gift of God in you, and the pure mind, and improve your talents; that ye may be the light of the world, a city set upon an hill, that cannot be hid. Let your light shine among the Indians, the Blacks and the Whites; that ye may answer the truth in them, and bring them to the standard and ensign, that God hath set up, Christ Jesus. For from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, God's name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every temple, or sanctified heart, <Q>incense shall be offered up to God's name.</Q> And have salt in yourselves, that ye may be the salt of the earth, that ye may salt it; that it may be pre∣served from corruption and putrefaction: so that all sacri∣fices offered up to the Lord may be seasoned, and be a good savour to God. All grow in the faith and grace of Christ, that ye may not be like dwarfs; for a dwarf shall not come near to offer upon God's altar; though he may eat of God's bread, that he may grow by it. And friends, be not negligent, but keep up your Negroes meetings and your family-meetings; and have meeting with the Indian kings, and their councils and subjects every where, and with others. Bring them all to the baptizing and circum∣cising Spirit, by which they may know God, and serve and worship him. And all take heed of sitting down in the earth, and having your minds in the earthly things, coveting and striving for the earth: for to be carnally mind∣ed brings death, and covetousness is idolatry. There is too much strife and contention about that idol, which makes too many go out of the sense and fear of God; so that some have lost morality, humanity; and true Chris∣tian charity. O therefore, be awakened to righteousness, and keep awakened; for the enemy soweth his tares, while men and women sleep in carelessness and security. There∣fore so many slothful ones go in their filthy rags, and have not the fine linen, the righteousness of Christ; but are straggling, and plowing with their ox and their ass, in their woollen and linen garments, mixt sluff feeding upon torn food, and that dieth of itself, and drinking of the
<PB N="435" REF="037441_0951_100D94E782A82D00"/>dregs of their old bottle, and eating the four, leavened bread, which makes their hearts burn one against another. But all are to keep the feast of Christ, our passover, with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. This un∣leavened bread of Life from heaven makes all hearts and souls glad and joyful, lightsome and cheerful, to serve and love God, and to love and serve one another in the peace∣able truth, and to keep in the unity of God's Spirit, which is the bond of (the Lord of lords, and the King of kings) peace. In this love and peace God Almighty keep and preserve all his people, and make them valiant for his truth upon the earth, to spread it abroad in doctrine, good life and conversation, Amen.</P>
<P>All the members of Christ have need one of another. For the foot hath need of the hand, and the hand hath need of the foot: the ear hath need of the eye, and the eye of the ear. So that all the members are serviceable in the body which Christ is the head of; and the head sees their service. Therefore let none despise the least member.</P>
<P>Have a care to keep down that greedy earthly mind, that raveneth and coveteth after the riches and things of this world; lest ye fall into the low region, like the gentiles or heathen, and so lose the kingdom of God that is everlasting: but seek that first, and God knows what ye have need of; who takes care for all both in hea∣ven and in the earth: thanks be unto God for his un∣speakable gifts, both temporal and spiritual!</P>

<P>Not long after I returned to London, and was almost daily with friends at meetings. When I had been near two weeks in town, the sense of the great hardships and sore suf∣ferings that friends had been and were under in Ireland coming with great weight upon me, I was moved to write the following epistle, as a word of consolation unto them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ, whom the Lord by his eternal arm and power hath upheld through your great sufferings, exercises, trials, and hardships (more, I believe, than can be uttered) up and down that nation, which I am very sensible of; and the rest of faithful friends that have been partakers with you
<PB N="436" REF="037441_0952_100D94E9EF66E728"/>in your sufferings: who cannot but suffer with the Lord's people that suffer. My confidence hath been in the Lord, that he would and will support you in all your sufferings; and that he would preserve all the faithful in his wisdom, that they might give no just occasion to one nor other to make them suffer; and if you did suffer wrongfully or un∣justly, that the righteous God would assist and uphold you; and reward them according to their works, that op∣pressed or wronged you. And now my desire is unto the Lord, that in the same holy and heavenly wisdom of God ye may all be preserved to the end of your days, to the glory of God, minding his supporting hand and power; who is God All-sufficient, to strengthen, help, and refresh in time of need. Let none forget the Lord's mercies and kindnesses, which endure for ever: but always live in the sense of them. And truly, friends, when I consider the thing, it is the great mercy of the Lord that ye have not been all swallowed up, seeing with what spirits ye have been compassed about. But the Lord carrieth his lambs in his arms, and they are as tender to him as the apple of his eye; and his power is his hedge about his vineyard of heavenly plants. Therefore it is good for all his children to be given up to the Lord with their minds and souls, hearts and spirits, who is a faithful keeper, that never slumbers nor sleeps; but is able to preserve and keep you, and to save to the utmost, and none can hurt so much as an hair of your heads, except he suffer it, to try you; for he upholds all things in heaven and earth, by the Word of his power: all things were made by Christ: and by him all things consist (mark, consist) whether they be visi∣bles or invisibles, &amp;c. So he hath power over all; for all power in heaven and earth is given to him: and to you, the have received him, he hath given power to become the sons and daughters of God; so living members of Christ, the living head, grafted into him in whom ye have eternal life. Christ the Seed reigns, and his power is over all; who bruises the serpent's head, and destroys the devil and his works, and was before he was. So all of you live and walk in Christ Jesus; that nothing may be between you and God, but Christ, in whom ye have salvation, life, rest, and peace with God.</P>
<P>As for the affairs of truth in this land and abroad, I hear, that in Holland and Germany, and thereaway, friends are in love, unity, and peace: and in Jamaica, Barbadoes,
<PB N="437" REF="037441_0953_100D94ECA0F86630"/>Nevis, Antigua, Maryland, and New England, I hear nothing, but friends are in unity and peace. The Lord preserve them all out of the world (in which there is trou∣ble) in Christ Jesus, in whom there is peace, life, love, and unity, Amen. My love in the Lord Jesus Christ to all friends every where in your land, as though I named them.</P>

<HEAD>DEATH AND BURIAL.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, reader, thou hast had some account of the life and travels, labours, sufferings, and manifold trials and exercises of this holy man of God, from his youth to al∣most the time of his death: Of which himself kept a jour∣nal; whence the foregoing sheets were transcribed. It re∣mains, that an account be added of the time, place, and manner of his death and burial; which was thus:
The next day, after he had written the foregoing epistle to friends in Ireland, he went to the meeting at Grace-church-street, which was large (it being on the first-day of the week): and the Lord enabled him to preach the truth fully and effectually, opening many deep and weighty things with great power and clearness. After which hav∣ing prayed, and the meeting being ended, he went to Hen∣ry Gouldney's (a friend's house in White-hart Court, near the meeting-house): and some friends going with him, he told them, <Q>He thought he felt the cold strike to his heart, as he came out of the meeting;</Q> yet added, <Q>I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear.</Q> As soon as those friends were withdrawn, he laid down upon a bed sas he sometimes used to do, through weariness after a meet∣ing) but soon rose again; and in a little time laid down again, complaining still of cold. And his strength sensibly decaying, he was fain soon after to go into the bed; where he lay in much contentment and peace, and very sensible to the last. And as, in the whole course of his life, his spirit, in the universal love of God, was set and bent for the
<PB N="438" REF="037441_0954_100D94EE347E4350"/>exalting of truth and righteousness, and the making known the way thereof to the nations and people afar off; so now, in the time of his outward weakness, his mind was intent upon, and wholly taken up with that: and he sent for some particular friends, to whom he expressed his mind, and de∣sire for the spreading friends books, and truth thereby in the world. Divers friends came to visit him in his illness, unto some of whom he said, <Q>All is well: the Seed of God reigns over all, and over death itself. And though,</Q> said he, <Q>I am weak in body: yet the power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all disorderly spirits.</Q> Thus lying in an heavenly frame of mind, his spirit wholly exer∣cised towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in his natural strength; and on the third day of that week, be∣tween the hours of nine and ten in the evening, he quietly departed this life in peace, and sweetly fell asleep in the Lord, whose blessed truth he had livingly and powerfully preached in the meeting but two days before. Thus ended he his day in his faithful testimony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and in peace and good-will to all men, on the 13th of the 11th month 1690, being then in the 67th year of his age.</P>
<P>Upon the 16th of the same month (being the sixth of the week, and the day appointed for his funeral) a very great concourse of friends, and other people of divers sorts, assem∣bled together at the meeting-house in White-hart Court near Gracechurch-street, about the middle time of the day, in order to attend his body to the grave. The meeting was held about two hours with great and heavenly solemnity, mani∣festly attended with the Lord's blessed presence and glorious power; in which divers living testimonies were delivered, from a lively remembrance and sense of the blessed ministry of this dear and ancient servant of the Lord, his early en∣tering into the Lord's work at the breaking forth of this gos∣pel day, his innocent life, long and great travels, and un∣wearied labours of love in the everlasting gospel, for the turning and gathering many thousands from darkness to the light of Christ Jesus, the foundation of true faith; the mani∣fold sufferings, afflictions, and oppositions, which he met withal for his faithful testimony, both from his open adver∣saries and from false brethren; and his preservations, deli∣verances, and dominion in, out of, and over them all, by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour always was by him, and is and always ought to be by all ascribed.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="037441_0955_100D94F04E6EEA70"/>
After the meeting was ended, his body was borne by friends, and accompanied by very great numbers, to friends burying-ground near Bunhill fields: where, after a solemn waiting upon the Lord, and several living testimonies borne, recommending the company to the guidance and protection of that divine Spirit and power, by which this holy man of God had been raised up, furnished, supported and preserv∣ed to the end of his day, his body was decently committed to the earth; but his memorial shall remain, and be ever∣lastingly blessed among the righteous.</P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>For the yearly and Second-day's meeting in London, and to all the children of God in all places in the world. By and from G. F.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>This for all the children of God every where, who are led by his Spirit, and walk in his light, in which they have life, unity, and fellowship with the Fa∣ther and the Son, and one with another.</P>
<P>KEEP all your meetings in the name of the Lord Jesus, that be gathered in his name by his light, grace, truth, power, and Spirit; by which you will feel his bles∣sed and refreshing presence among you and in you, to your comfort and God's glory.</P>
<P>And now friends, all your meetings, both men's and women's, monthly, quarterly, and yearly, &amp;c. were set up by the power, Spirit, and wisdom of God; and in them you know that you have felt his power, and Spi∣rit, and wisdom, and blessed refreshing presence among you, and in you, to his praise and glory, and your com∣fort: so that you have been a <Q>city set on a hill, that cannot be hid.</Q></P>
<P>And although many loose and unruly spirits have risen betimes to oppose you and them, in print and other ways, you have seen how they have come to nought. The Lord hath blasted them, brought their deeds to light, and
<PB N="440" REF="037441_0956_100D94F1E5B3A838"/>made them manifest to be trees without fruit, wells with∣out water, wandering stars from the firmament of God's power, and raging waves of the sea, casting up their mire and dirt; and many of them are like the dog turned to his old vomit, and the sow that was washed, turned again to the mire. This hath been the condition of many, God knoweth, and his people!</P>
<P>Therefore all stand steadfast in Christ Jesus your head, in whom you are all one, male and female, and know his government, of the increase of whose government and peace there shall be no end; but there will be an end of the devil's, and of all that are out of Christ, who oppose it and him, whose judgment doth not linger, and their damnation doth not slumber. Therefore in God and Christ's light, life, Spirit, and power live and walk, that is over all (and the Seed of it) in love, in innocency, and simplicity. In righteousness and holiness dwell, and in his power and Holy Ghost, in which God's kingdom doth stand. All children of new and heavenly Jerusalem, that is from above, and is free, with all her holy spiritual chil∣dren, to her keep your eyes.</P>
<P>As for this spirit of rebellion and opposition that hath risen formerly and lately, it is out of the kingdom of God and heavenly Jerusalem; and is for judgment and con∣demnation, with all its books, words, and works. There∣fore friends are to live and walk in the power and Spirit of God that is over it, and in the Seed that will bruise and break it to pieces. In which Seed you have joy and peace with God, and power and authority to judge it; and your unity is in the power and Spirit of God, that doth judge it: all God's witnesses in his tabernacle go out against it, and always have and will.</P>
<P>Let no man live to self, but to the Lord, as they will die in him; and seek the peace of the church of Christ, and the peace of all men in him: for <Q>blessed are the peace-makers.</Q> Dwell in the pure, peaceable, heavenly wisdom of God, that is gentle and easy to be intreated, that is full of mercy; all striving to be of one mind, heart, soul, and judgment in Christ, having his mind and Spirit dwelling in you, building up one another in the love of God, which doth edify the body of Christ, his church, who is the holy head thereof. Glory to God through Christ, in this age and all other ages, who is the Rock and Foundation, the Emmanuel, God with us, Amen.
<PB N="441" REF="037441_0957_100D94F4E49232A8"/>over all, the beginning and the ending. In him live and walk, in whom you have life eternal, in him you will feel me, and I you.</P>
<P>All children of New Jerusalem, that descends from above, the holy city, which the Lord and the Lamb is the light of, and is the temple; in it they are born again of the Spirit: so Jerusalem that is above, is the mother of them that are born of the Spirit. These that come and are come to heavenly Jerusalem, receive Christ; and he giveth them power to become the sons of God and they are born again of the Spirit: so Jerusalem that is above, is their mother. Such come to heavenly Mount Sion, and the innumerable company of angels, to the Spirits of just men made perfect; and to the church of the Living God written in heaven, and have the name of God written upon them. So here is a new mother, that bringeth forth a heavenly and spiritual generation.</P>
<P>There is no schism, no division, no contention, nor strife in heavenly Jerusalem, nor in the body of Christ, which is made up of living stones, a spiritual house. Christ is not divided, for in him there is peace. Christ saith, "In me you have peace." And he is from above, and not of this world; but in the world below, in the spi∣rit of it there is trouble; therefore keep in Christ, and walk in him, Amen.</P>

<HEAD>A narrative of the spreading of truth, and of the opposition from the powers which then were, written by George Fox, in the year 1676.</HEAD>
<P>THE truth sprang up first to us, so as to be a people to the Lord, in Leicestershire in 1644, in War∣wickshire in 1645, in Nottinghamshire in 1646, in Derby∣shire in 1647, and in the adjacent counties in 1648, 1649, and 1650; in Yorkshire in 1651, in Lancashire and West∣moreland in 1652, in Cumberland, Durham, and Nor∣thumberland in 1653, in London and most of the other parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, in 1654.</P>
<P>In 1655 many went beyond sea, where truth also sprang up, and in 1656 it broke forth in America and many other places.</P>
<P>In the authority of this divine truth friends stood all the cruelties and sufferings that were inflicted upon them by the long parliament; to the spoiling of goods, imprison∣ment, and death, and over all reproaches, lies, and slan∣ders; as well as those in Oliver Cromwell's time, and all the acts made by him and his parliament; his son Richard after him, and the committee of safety; and after withstood and outlasted all the acts and proclamations since 1660, that the king came in.</P>
<P>Friends never feared their acts, prisons, gaols, houses of correction, banishment, nor spoiling of goods, nay, nor the loss of life itself; nor was there ever any persecution that came, but we saw in the event in would be productive of good; nor were there ever any prisons that I was in, or sufferings, but it was for the bringing multitudes out of prison; though they who imprisoned the truth, and quenched the Spirit in themselves, would imprison and quench it without them; so that there was a time when so many were in prison, that it became as a bye-word, <Q>truth is scarce any where to be found but in gaols.</Q></P>
<P>And after the king came in, divers friends suffered much, because they would not drink his health, and say, "God bless the king;" so that many friends were in danger of their lives from rude persons, who were ready to run them through with their swords for refusing it, until the king gave forth a proclamation against drinking healths;
<PB N="443" REF="037441_0959_100D94F8CBFC4490"/>for we were and are against drinking any healths, and all excess, both before his coming in and after; and we de∣sire the king's good, and that the blessing of God might come upon him and all his subjects, and all people upon the face of the earth; but we did desire people not to drink the king's health, but let him have his health, and all people else; and to drink for their own health and necessity only; for that way of drinking healths, and to excess, was not for the king's health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their own, nor any others; which excess often brought forth quarrelling and destroying one another: for they destroyed the crea∣tion and one another; and this was not for the king's wealth, nor health, nor honour, but might grieve him to have the creatures and his subjects destroyed; and so the Lord's power gave us dominion over that also, and all our other sufferings. But,</P>
<P>Oh! the number of sufferers in the commonwealth's and Oliver Cromwel's days, and since; especially those who were haled before the courts for not paying tithes, re∣fusing to swear on their juries, not putting off their hats, and for going to meetings on the first-days; under pre∣tence of breaking the sabbath; and to meetings on other days of the week; who were abused both in meetings and on the highways.</P>
<P>Oh! how great were the sufferings we then sustained up∣on these accounts! for sometimes they would drive friends by droves into the prison-houses like pensolds, confine them on the first-days, and take their horses from them, and keep them for pretended breach of their sabbath, though they would ride in their coaches and upon their fat horses to the steeple-houses themselves, and yet punish others. And many friends were turned out of their copy-holds and customary tenements, because in obedience to the command of Christ and his apostle, they could not swear; and as they went to meetings, they have been stoned through the streets, and otherwise cruelly abused. Many were fined with great fines, and lay long in prison for not putting off their hats, which fines friends could never pay, though they kept them in prison till they had satisfied their own wills, and at last turned them out, af∣ter keeping them a year or more in prison.</P>
<P>Many books I gave forth against tithes, shewing how the priesthood was changed that took them; and that Christ sent forth his twelve, and afterwards seventy disci∣ples,
<PB N="444" REF="037441_0960_100D94FADD279F80"/>saying unto them, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give.</Q> So all who do not obey the doctrine and com∣mand of Christ therein, we cannot receive them.</P>
<P>I was also moved to give forth several books against swearing, and that our Yea and Nay might be taken in∣stead of an oath, which if we broke, let us suffer the same punishment as they who broke their oaths. And in Ja∣maica the governor and the assembly granted the thing; it is also granted in some other places; and several of the parliament-men in England have acknowledged the rea∣sonableness thereof. The magistrates, after some time, when they saw our faithfulness in Yea and Nay, they who were moderate, both before and since the king came in, would put friends into offices without an oath; but the cruel and envious would fine friends to get money of them, though they could not pay them any.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord's power hath carried us through all, and over all, to his everlasting glory and praise; for God's power bath been our hedge, our wall and our keeper (the preserver of his plants and vineyard) who have not had the magistrates sword and staff to help us, nor ever trusted in the arm of flesh, but have gone without these, or Judas's bag, to preach the word of life, which was in the beginning before they were; which word reconciles to God. And thousands have received this word of reconci∣liation, and are born again of the immortal Seed, by the Word of God; and are feeding upon the milk of the word, which lives and abides for ever.</P>
<P>Many have suffered death for their testimony, in Eng∣land and beyond the seas, both before and since the king came in; which may be seen in an account given to the king and both houses of parliament; being a brief, plain, and true relation of the late and sad sufferings of the peo∣ple of God in scorn called Quakers, for worshipping and exercising a good conscience towards God and man.</P>
<P>By reason whereof eighty-nine have suffered till death, thirty-two of which died before the king came into Eng∣land, and fifty-seven since, by hard imprisonment and cruel usage. Forty-three have died in the city of London and Southwark since the Act made against meetings, &amp;c. about 1661, of which a more particular account was given, with the names of the sufferers to the king and parliament, about 1663.</P>
<P>And though divers laws were designed against us, yet
<PB N="445" REF="037441_0961_100D94FE8BE63420"/>never could any of them justly touch us, being wrested and misapplied in their execution by our adversaries, which some have been made to confess. All those laws that were made, and the oath which they imprisoned us for, because, in obedience to the command of Christ Jesus, we could not swear at all, were not originally intended against us; and yet we suffered by the several powers, and their laws, both spoiling of goods and imprisonment, even to death. And the governor of Dover castle, when the king asked him if he had dispersed all the sectaries meet∣ings? said, that he had; but the Quakers, the devil him∣self could not; for if he did imprison them, and break up their meetings, they would meet again; and if he should beat them or knock them down, or kill some of them, all was one, they would meet, and not resist again. Thus the Lord's power did support and keep them over their persecutors, and made them to justify our patience and lamb-like nature. This was about 1671.</P>
<P>Since the king came in, three acts have been made against us, besides the proclamations, by which many have suffered imprisonment and banishment, and many to death. And yet for all these acts and proclamations, persecutions, sufferings, banishments, faithful friends are as fresh as ever in the Lord's power, and valiant for his name and truth.</P>
<P>Some weak ones there were, when the king came in, who did take the oath; but after they had so done, they were sore troubled for disobeying the command of Christ and the apostle, and went to the magistrates, condemned themselves, and offered to go to prison.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord, in his everlasting power hath been the support and stay of his people; and still his Seed reigns, his truth is over all, and exceedingly spreads unto this year 1676.</P>

<HEAD>A warning to the magistrates and people of the city of Oldenburg:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you seen and felt the judgments of God upon your city, the Lord sending lightning from heaven, that destroyed and burnt it? As I passed through your city on a first-day of the week, which you call your sab∣bath, I saw some drinking, soldiers playing at shuffle-board, and others with their shops open, and trading,
<PB N="446" REF="037441_0962_100D95001FE534F8"/>when they should have been waiting upon God, and wor∣shipping him; and your people were light and vain, with∣out any sense of God's judgments, or repentance. O therefore repent, lest the all-seeing God, who sees all your actions, and is over all, bring swift judgment upon you in his wrath, fury, and indignation. Repent, and lay aside all manner of evil, wickedness, ungodliness, and unright∣eousness: for the day of the Lord will come upon all that do evil, all the workers of iniquity. This mighty day of the Lord will find them all out, and will burn as an oven; burn up all the proud and wicked, and neither leave them root nor branch. Therefore all ye magistrates, priests, and people, search in yourselves to find out the cause, and what evil you have committed, that has brought the wrath, vengeance, and judgments of God upon you and your city, in burning of it. All return, and come to the light of Christ in your hearts, to God's spirit, to the grace and truth in your hearts, that comes by Jesus Christ; that with it ye may search your hearts. Do not grieve, nor vex, nor quench God's good Spirit in your hearts; walk not despitefully against the Spirit of grace, nor turn from it into wantonness; and yet make a profession of God and Christ in words, when your hearts are afar off, living in pleasures, and wantonly upon the earth, sporting your∣selves, killing the just, crucifying to yourselves Christ afresh, and putting him to open shame; so dishonouring God. Christ, and christianity, yet making a profession and a trade of the scriptures; keeping people always learn∣ing, that they may be always paying.</P>
<P>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and look unto the Lord, all ye ends of the earth, and be sav∣ed; for the Lord God of heaven and earth is come to teach his people himself by his light, Spirit, grace, and truth, and to bring them off all the world's teachers. God hath raised up Christ Jesus his prophet, whom peo∣ple should hear; and saith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him:</Q> and Christ saith, <Q>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life; and no man comes to the Father, but by me.</Q> There is no salvation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Jesus, who saith, <Q>I am the good Shepherd, and have laid down my life for my sheep, and my sheep hear my voice and follow me, and will not follow the hireling:</Q> for Christ feeds them in the pastures of life, that will never wither.
<PB N="447" REF="037441_0963_100D950293DB2910"/>God hath anointed Christ Jesus to preach, if you will hear him; and God hath given Christ for a counsellor and a leader, if you will be led and counselled by him; and God hath given Christ for a bishop to oversee you, and a king to rule you, if you will be overseen and ruled by him. You that will not have Christ to rule over you, who never sinned, nor was guile found in his mouth, you may read his sentence in the New Testament upon such. Is not Christ a sufficient teacher, whose blood was shed for you, and tasted death for every man? Doth not Christ say to his ministers, "Freely ye have received, freely give?" And the apostle saith, <Q>We covet no man's gold, silver, or apparel.</Q> They laboured with their hands, and kept the gospel without charge. Have they that are called mi∣nisters amongst you done the same, and kept this command of Christ Jesus? Let them be examined, and examine themselves. Have you not trimmed your outsides? but look within with the light and Spirit of Christ Jesus, and see if your insides be not black and foul. For Christ Je∣sus, who doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world with the life in himself, saith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</Q> With the light ye may see all the evil and ungodly deeds that ye have committed, all your ungodly words you have spo∣ken, and all your ungodly thoughts ye think; that ye may turn from them to Christ, from whence the light comes: who is your Saviour and Redeemer, who hath given you a light to see your sin, and that you are dead in Adam; that with the same light you may see Christ, the quickening Spirit, who makes you alive to God, and saves you from your sin. But if you hate the light, which is the life in Christ, the Prince of life; and love the dark∣ness and the prince of darkness more than the light or the life in Christ, because it will reprove you; Christ tells you, "This light will be your condemnation," John. iii. Therefore be warned now in your day. While you have time, turn to the Lord. Do not quench the Spirit of the Father, by which he draws to his Son; nor hate the light of Christ; for if you do, you hate the life in Christ, and so remain under condemnation from God and Christ with the light, who now speaks to his people by his Son, as he did in the apostle's days; the same God, that was the speaker by the prophets to the fathers, and speaker to Adam and Eve in paradise: and happy had Adam and Eve, and
<PB N="448" REF="037441_0964_100D95042FFAEDB0"/>the Jews, and all Christians been, if they had kept to this speaker, and not have followed the serpent, that false speak∣er, and his instruments. And now God is the true speak∣er by his Son, who bruises the head of the serpent, the false teacher, the head of all false ways, false prophets, false churches, and false religions and worships. So God in Christ is bringing people to the pure undefiled religion, that will keep them from the spots of the world, into the new and living way Christ Jesus; and to the Church in God, which Christ is the head of, as he was in the apos∣tles days; and to worship God in the Spirit and truth, which worship Christ set up above sixteen hundred years since. Therefore must all people come to the grace and Spirit of truth in their own hearts, to know the God of truth, who is a Spirit, and in the Spirit and truth to wor∣ship, serve, honour, and glorify the living God, who is over all, and worthy of all, blessed for evermore, Amen!</P>
<P>Ye magistrates and officers, read this in all your assem∣blies, and cause all your priests to read it in their churches; that they and you, and all people may hear and fear the God of heaven, as you will answer it at the great and ter∣rible day of judgment, and vengeance of the Lord God Almighty. This is in love to your souls, and for your temporal and eternal good.</P>

<HEAD>An epistle concerning true fasting, true prayer, true ho∣nour, and against persecution, and for the true liberty in Christ Jesus; that all may have a care that the apos∣tle hath not bestowed his labour in vain upon you in your observing of days, months, times, feasts, and years, and of coming under the beggarly elements, and the yoke of bondage again, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ringing and forcing people into them.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE did ever Christ or his apostles command any believers or Christians to observe holy-days or feast-days? Let us see where it is written in the New Testament, in the four evangelists, the epistles, or the Revelation, that ever Christ or his apostles commanded Christians to observe the time called Christmas, or a day for Christ's birth? or to observe the time called Easter,
<PB N="449" REF="037441_0965_100D9507906FDED8"/>or Whitfuntide, or Peter's, Paul's, Mark's, or Luke's, or any other saint's day?</P>
<P>You, that profess yourselves to be reformed churches from the Papists, Jews, and Heathens, and the scriptures to be your rule, and are professors of the new covenant, where do you prove out of the New Testament, that the apostles and the primitive church practised or forced any such thing, or that Christ and his apostles gave any such command to the churches, that they should practise and observe any such days? Let us see where this command is written. Did not the apostle say to the Galatians in the fourth chapter, <Q>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather ye are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, lest I have bestow∣ed upon you labour in vain.</Q> And in the third of Gala∣tians it is said, <Q>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth,</Q> &amp;c. And in Galatians the fifth, the apostle exhorts them to <Q>stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free:</Q> and moreover said, <Q>Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</Q></P>
<P>Doth not this manifest there were some teachers that were drawing the church of the Galatians into these beg∣garly elements, and bringing them again into bondage, in observing of days, months, times, and years? It was the apostle's work to bring them out of those bondages and beggarly elements; therefore when they were going back again into observing days, months, times, and years, he was afraid that he had <Q>bestowed his labour upon them in vain:</Q> and he exhorts them to <Q>stand fast in the liber∣ty wherewith Christ Jesus hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage:</Q> and again signifies, <Q>that they had been once entangled with that yoke of bondage and beggarly elements.</Q> But O! how are people, called Christians, since the apostles days, gone again under this yoke of bondage, and these beggarly elements, in observing days, months, times, and years, let their practice declare. Nay, do not both Papists and Protestants force people to observe days, months, and times? And therefore is not the apostle's labour and tra∣vail bestowed upon Christendom in vain, which was to bring people from under such beggarly elements and that
<PB N="450" REF="037441_0966_100D950A18D577B8"/>yoke of bondage (which the law did require) to <Q>stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage?</Q> It was and is Christ that hath made and doth make his people free from these beggarly elements; therefore the re∣deemed are to <Q>stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free.</Q> This liberty all true Christians are to stand fast in; they are made free by Christ, and not by man; for man, without the Spirit and mind of Christ, seeks to force and compel Christ's followers, such as he hath made free from the yoke of bondage, to outward things that the law commanded, to the observing of days, months, times, feasts, and years. From such weak, beg∣garly elements, those that know God, or are known of God and Christ, are to stand fast in their liberty, and not come under nor be entangled with the yoke of bondage again, seeing he hath made them free. For they that are in such things, and would force others to them, are gone from that which gives the knowledge of God, and have not stood fast in the liberty wherewith Christ makes free.</P>
<P>Concerning prayer, we do not read that ever Christ or his apostles did seek by force to compel any to fast or pray with them. But Christ taught them how they should pray, and be distinct from the hypocrites. His words are as followeth: <Q>When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to stand praying in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men, &amp;c. But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father, that seeth in secret, will reward thee openly. But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him,</Q> &amp;c. As the apostles and saints did, so do we; we pray in secret, and we pray in publick, as the spirit gives us utterance, which helps our infirmities, as it did the apostles and true Chris∣tians: after this manner we pray for ourselves, and for all men both high and low.</P>
<P>Concerning fasting, Christ saith, <Q>Moreover when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. But when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and
<PB N="451" REF="037441_0967_100D950BAD75DCF8"/>wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</Q></P>
<P>You may see in Isaiah lviii, what the true fast the Lord requires is, where it is said to the prophet, <Q>Cry aloud, and spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins; yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God; they ask of me the ordi∣nances of justice, they take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sack-cloth and ashes under him? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord; to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</Q> So this fast that the Lord requires, is not to lay yokes, to oppress, and lay heavy burdens, and to make fast the bands of wickedness; but to loose and break such things.</P>
<P>Further, Concerning the true fast the Lord requires, <Q>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor, that are cast out, to thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh? (Do you keep this true fast?) Then shall thy light break forth as the morn∣ing, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am: If thou take away from the midst of thee the yokes, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light arise out of obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon-day. And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in
<PB N="452" REF="037441_0968_100D950D486619C8"/>drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose wa∣ters fail not,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here is the practice of the true fast the Lord requires of his people; and to them that observe this fast, the Lord saith, "When they call, he will answer." You may see what glorious and happy comforts they receive from the Lord, that keep this true fast; but such as fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fists of wickedness, <Q>to make their voices to be heard on high, to afflict their souls for a day, to bow down their head as a bulrush, and loose not the bands of wickedness, nor undo every heavy burden, break off every yoke, and let the oppressed go free, that does not deal his bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and bring the poor to his house, but hides himself from his own flesh;</Q> such fasts and fasters the Lord doth not accept, neither hath he chosen them. These appear to men with their disfigured faces, hanging down their heads as a bulrush for a day, like the hypo∣crites, to fast, as Christ speaks in Matth. vi.</P>
<P>Is it not the command of Christ, that in their fast they should not appear unto men to fast? And now you, that would force us to shut up our shops on fasting-days, or for a day, does not this fast appear to men? and is not this the fast, that the Lord saith in Isaiah, <Q>he doth not accept?</Q> for he saith, <Q>Is this the fast that I have cho∣sen, a day for a man to afflict his soul, and bow down his head as a bulrush,</Q> &amp;c. <Q>Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?.</Q> Isa. lviii.</P>
<P>Therefore all God's people are to keep the true fast of the Lord from debate and strife, and the fists of wicked∣ness; that <Q>fast that breaks the bands of wickedness, un∣does every heavy burden, breaks every yoke, lets the op∣pressed go free, deals bread to the hungry, clothes the naked, and brings the poor that are cast out to his own house.</Q> Every one that keeps this true fast, their health shall grow, and when they call, the Lord will hear them; <Q>he will be their guide continually, satisfy their souls in drought, make their bones fat, and they shall be like a wa∣tered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</Q> Now you, that keep not this true fast, when you call upon the Lord on your own fasting-days, does the Lord answer you, and say, "Here I am?" Doth the Lord guide you continually? Are your bones made fat
<PB N="453" REF="037441_0969_100D9510083AC7F0"/>by him, and your souls satisfied in drought? Are you like a watered garden, and like a spring whose waters fail not? You that keep not this true fast, do you not want these waters which fail not? so your souls are not satisfied in drought, but your bones are lean, and you hear not the voice of the Lord, who saith, "Here I am:" so you lose the heritage of Jacob, and ride not upon the high∣places there; but come under. Therefore every man and woman, shut your hearts against all manner of evil whatsoever, and trade not with Babylon's merchants of confusion; but keep the supernatural day of Christ, that is sprung from on high, that is kept by believing and walk∣ing in the light of Christ, and being grafted into him. This will bring you to the true fast, from seeding upon any evil, and to the true praying in the Spirit, as Christ and the apostles have taught. The fruit of the Spirit is love, &amp;c. The birth of the Spirit is not a persecuting birth; but he that is born of the flesh will persecute him that is born of the Spirit, because he will not follow the birth of the flesh, with its weak, beggarly elements, that entangles with its yoke of bondage, and its observing of days, months, times, fasts, feasts, and years: which the birth of the Spirit is to stand fast against in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made it free.</P>
<P>Do you not know that the Turks keep their sabbath on the sixth-day, the Jews upon the seventh-day, and the Christians meet together on the first-day of the week? And that day, which the Turks keep, the Jews and Chris∣tians shops are open; and that day the Jews keep, Chris∣tians and Turks shops are open; and the first-days, that the Christians keep, both Jews and Turks shops are open? The Turk does not force the Jews nor the Christians to shut up their shops on their meeting-days, but lets them have their liberty in Turkey. And where do you read that ever the Turks forced any Christians to observe any of their holy days, fasts, or feasts? If not, should not Christians be beyond the Turks in giving liberty to all tender consciences to serve God, seeing Christ and the apostles command not nor force people to observe holy days, or times, or months, or years, but should pray al∣ways in the Spirit, and fast always from strife and debate, from all manner of sin and evil; and that will keep down the fist of wickedness, and the bond of iniquity? Why should not people of a tender conscience have their
<PB N="454" REF="037441_0970_100D95119C9B70C8"/>liberty to exercise their consciences towards God, that they may have a <Q>good conscience always, towards God and man,</Q> to perform that which God requires, and <Q>to do unto all men as they would have them to do unto them, and to love their neighbours as themselves;</Q> seeing so many debauched, evil and seared consciences, as with an hot iron, have liberty in their loose lives and conversa∣tions, and in their loose words, whose tongues are at liberty to swear and curse, and their spirits at liberty in drunken∣ness and uncleanness? Let the magistrates look and see how this evil seared conscience hath its liberty to be exer∣cised in all manner of evil things all Christendom over: which is a great shame and dishonour to God, Christ, and Christianity, yea, and humanity. Therefore why should not God's people have liberty to exercise their good and tender consciences towards God and man? The mystery of faith, which Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of, is held in a pure conscience; and should not the work of the true Christian magistrate be to encourage the exercise of this pure conscience towards God and man, and to dis∣courage the exercise of this evil seared conscience that dis∣honours both God and Christ, and true Christianity? If not, how are they a praise to them that do well, and a terror to evil doers?</P>
<P>Concerning the not putting off our hats to men. Ma∣ny under the name of Christians, have taken offence at us because we could not put off our hats, and bow down to them; which we find no command from Christ or his apostles for, but rather to the contrary. For Christ saith, "I receive not honour of men" (mark, he did not receive honour of men): and further, <Q>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that comes from God only?</Q> Now Christ de∣clares it to be a mark of unbelievers, that seek <Q>honour one of another,</Q> and seek not that <Q>honour that comes from God only;</Q> and is not the putting off the hat, and bowing with it, an honour to men, which they seek one of another, and are offended if they have it not? Do not the very Turks mock at the Christians in their proverb, saying, <Q>The Christians spend much of their time in put∣ting off their hats, and shewing their bare head to one an∣other?</Q> Should not those be beyond Turks, that bear the noble name of Christian, above seeking honour one of an∣other, and persecuting them that will not give it, when all
<PB N="455" REF="037441_0971_100D9513AAF43358"/>true believing Christians should seek the honour that comes from God only? which is the duty of all true believers in Christ Jesus, for he would not receive honour of men. And <Q>he that believeth on the Son of God, hath ever∣lasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him,</Q> John iii. 36. Is not the Turks proverb a reproach to the Chris∣tians, who say, <Q>That the Christians spend much of their time in putting off their hats, and shewing their bare head one to another?</Q> Have you not sined and imprisoned ma∣ny, because they would not put off their hats to you, and shew you their bare heads? In many of your courts they shall not have right and justice, nor liberty and free∣dom in cities or states, though they have truly served their time, and are honest and civil men, unless they will put off their hats, and shew you their bare head? Have you not made a law against such, that they must forfeit two guilders if they do it not? Do not you seek to compel and force them to do it, and fine such as do not, as at Lans∣meer in Waterland? Is not this the honour that you seek one of another? Did not the Pharisees and Jews do the same?</P>
<P>As for your saying, <Q>The apostle commands to honour all men; and such as rule well are worthy of double ho∣nour:</Q> If this "honouring all men" were to put off their hats to all men, and shew all men their bare heads, then this command you break yourselves, for you do not this to all men generally; and if they that rule well, must have double hat-honour, then they must put off their hats twice, and shew them their bare heads. If this hat-honour, and shewing the bare head, be an invention of men, and not from God, and ye cannot prove it by scripture, yet say, "It is your rule,;" then you act beside the rule, and compel people to act contrary to your rule. For where did ever the prophets, Christ, or the apostles command any such thing? Let us see a command, a practice, and an example for it. Nebuchadnezzar, who was a persecu∣tor, and cast the three children of Israel into the fire with their hose, cloaks, and hats, we do not read that he was offended at them because they did not put off their hats, and shew him their bare heads; but because they would not bow to his image. And is it not said in the margin of the bible, where it is said, "Honour all men", <Q>Have all men in esteem?</Q> Then they that rule well, are wor∣thy
<PB N="456" REF="037441_0972_100D95155C1358F0"/>of double esteem; and this esteem must be truly in the heart, without any envy, malice, or hatred. As all men are the workmanship of God, they are to be esteem∣ed in the heart with the Spirit of God; and they that rule well, are worthy of double esteem: here is true ho∣nour from the heart, both to God and man, his workman∣ship. For people may put off their hats and shew their bare heads one to another once, or twice to the officers and magistrates, and yet be full of envy, malice, hatred, and murder in their hearts one against another; and give them that honour, as you call it, and yet speak or wish evil towards them, when they have turned their backs off them. The true honour or esteem in the heart to all men, as they are God's creation, is without any evil wish or thought in the heart to any, and they that rule well have the double esteem, whom God hath placed over people. There is no evil in the heart that gives this respect, esteem, or honour, and brings them love their neighbours as themselves, and to <Q>do unto all men as they would have them do unto them,</Q> in that they esteem all men, and have a double esteem for them that rule well. This is beyond all the honour of putting off the hats once to all men, and twice to them that are worthy of the double-honour, as you may call it. But we would ask Chris∣tians, that practise this hat-honour, and shewing one ano∣ther their bare heads, Who invented this honour, seeing they cannot prove that ever Christ or the apostles did com∣mand or practise any such thing, or Moses in the time of the law? Do not say or think that we had this practice of not putting off our hats from the Turk; for we were mov∣ed by the Spirit of the Lord, before ever we heard of the Turks proverb and practice, to leave the honour that is below, and seek the honour that comes from above, when we came to be true believers in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Concerning persecuting, imprisoning, and banishing God's people, in whom Christ is manifest, and dwells in their hearts, doth not Christ tell you, that in so doing you imprison him? Then do you not banish him, and perse∣cute him out of your cities and corporations? And how can you enter into and have a share in his kingdom, though you may profess him in words? Are not such to go into everlasting punishment, that do not visit Christ in prison? Then what will become of you, that banish and imprison him where he is manifest in his members, nor suffer them
<PB N="457" REF="037441_0973_100D95177574EFC0"/>to meet together to enjoy him amongst them, according to his promise? Therefore you, that will not let Christ reign in his people, and have his liberty in them in your cities and countries, to exercise his offices, you will not have your liberty in heaven. You that will not let Christ reign in your hearts, nor suffer him to reign in his people here upon the earth, in this world, in your kingdoms, you will not reign with Christ in heaven, in his kingdom, nor in the world without end.</P>
<P>You, that banish the truth out of your cities or coun∣tries, or his people for its sake, you banish the truth and Christ out of your hearts from ruling there; so you your∣selves are not the temples of God. When you have banished Christ and his truth out of your own hearts, you banish such, in whom he rules, out of your estates and country; then see what judgments the Lord doth bring upon you, when you are left to yourselves; yea, fears and troubles, one judgment after another, comes upon you, till you are even filled with them. But the banish∣ed, the sufferers for truth and Christ's sake, have a peacea∣ble habitation in the truth, which the devil is out of, and cannot get into; which habitation will outlast all the habitations of the wicked and persecutors, though they be never so full of words without life and truth. The life and the truth will outlast all airy notions; and Christ the Lamb and his patient Seed, will overcome the devourer with his impatient seed: and they that have the garment, the righteousness of Christ, which is the fine linen, will find it to outlast all the rags and inventions of men. Christ saith to his learners, <Q>Be of good cheer I have overcome the world, the persecuting world.</Q> He also said to his disciples, <Q>Marvel not if that the world hate you, for it hated me before you.</Q> Therefore let all that profess themselves Christians, lay aside persecution about religion, churches or worship, fasting or praying days; for you have no command from Christ and his apostles to persecute any. Christ, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, when they called him a deceiver, blasphe∣med him, and said, "He had a devil," did not persecute any of them for it, nor force or compel any to hear and believe him, nor the apostles after him; but he bad them, that would have been plucking up the tares, <Q>let the tares and the wheat grow together until the harvest.</Q> So
<PB N="458" REF="037441_0974_100D9519DB3F7AA8"/>you have no command from Christ or his apostles to per∣secute, imprison, banish, or spoil the goods of any for matter of pure conscience and religion, worship, faith, and church in the gospel-times.</P>

<HEAD>A warning to the magistrates, priests, and people of the city of Hamburgh, to humble themselves before the Lord, and not to be high-minded.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have painted and garnished the inside of your outward houses and high-places; but look within your hearts with the light of Christ, which he hath enlight∣ened you and every man that cometh into the world with∣al, and with it you may see how foul your hearts and in∣sides are with sin and evil, which Christ tells you ye should make clean; who told the Pharisees how they "painted the sepulchres of the righteous," and they them∣selves were full of rottenness and corruption. Therefore look into yourselves and your own hearts, what you are full of. To paint the sepulchres of the righteous apostles, and make a trade and a profession of their words, without the same Holy Ghost, power, light, and truth which they were in, will not stand the day of God's vengeance. Therefore repent while you have time, turn to the Lord with your whole hearts, and do not think yourselves se∣cure without a sense of his immediate almighty protection. For it is not all your works, nor all your own strength, power, and defence that can protect you. It is not for you to look at them, and think yourselves secure, and to sit down in your security, and let your hearts be merry, and at rest and ease. When the Lord brings a scourge upon you, that you are filled with terrors and fears, re∣member you were warned, that you were set down, but not in the true rest. Then all your own strength and force will stand you in no stead; you will acknowledge that it must be God that must protect you. Therefore take warning; for your priests and people are too high, are swallowed up too much in this world. The vanities
<PB N="459" REF="037441_0975_100D951BE06BE570"/>of it carry your minds away from God; your care is more for the world than for God, and more after the riches of this world than after the riches of the world that has no end. Know you not that all your heaps of outward trea∣sure must have an end, and that you must leave them all behind you? Therefore I am to warn and advise you, both high and low, priests and people, to come to the grace, light, and truth that comes by Jesus Christ; to the manifestation of the good Spirit of God, which is giv∣en you to profit withal; that with this grace, truth, light, and Spirit of Christ, you may turn to him from whence it comes, who saith, "Learn of me;" and God saith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." So all the children of the new covenant, that walk in the new and living way, do hear Christ their prophet, that God has raised up, and anointed to be their teacher and priest. So now, God doth speak to his people by his Son, as he did in the apostles days. The Lord is come to teach his people himself by his grace, light, truth, and Spirit, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers, made by men since the apostles days; who have kept people always learning, that they may always be paying of them. And he is come to bring them off all the world's religions, to the religion that he set up in the apostles days in the new covenant, which is pure and undefiled before God in his sight, and keeps from the spots of the world, &amp;c. And the Lord is come to bring them off all the world's churches, to the church in God, which Christ the heaven∣ly man is head of; and to bring them off all the world's worships, to worship God in Spirit and in truth, which Christ set up above sixteen hundred years since. So all men and women must come to the Spirit and truth in their hearts, by which they must know the God of truth, who is a Spirit; and then in the Spirit and truth they will worship him, and know what and who they worship. Al∣so the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's temples, that with the Spirit they may know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Ghost. And the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's crosses, pic∣tures, images, and likenesses; to know that the power of God is the cross of Christ, which crucisies them to the world, and brings them up into the likeness and image of God man and woman were in before they fell; and so to
<PB N="460" REF="037441_0976_100D951DB2521868"/>Christ that never fell. This work must all know in their hearts by the light of Christ Jesus, who <Q>is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</Q> It is called the light in man and woman, and the life in Christ the Word; who saith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</Q> And the light lets you see all your evil actions that you have committed, your ungodly ways you have walked in, and your ungod∣ly words and thoughts. If you hate this light, and love the darkness, and the prince of it, more than this light, which is the life in Christ, the Prince of life, and will not come to it, because your deeds be evil, and it will reprove you, Christ tells you, "This light is your condemnation." Then what is all your profession good for, when you re∣main under the condemnation of the true light, in which you should believe, and so become children of light, and out of condemnation? Therefore every one must believe in the light, if they receive Christ Jesus; and to as many as receive him, he gives <Q>power to become the sons of God.</Q> He that hath the Son of God, hath life; they that have not the Son of God, have not life; and if you have not life, what good doth all your profession of the scriptures from Genesis to Revelations do you, any more than the Jews, Scribes, and Pharisees, that would not re∣ceive Christ the life, upon whom God brought his over∣flowing scourge. Therefore do you take heed for your strength will be no better than theirs, if you have not God and Christ's supporting power, when God's scourge comes upon you, and you are filled with horrors and fears. My desires are, that you may all repent, from the highest to the lowest, and not grieve, nor quench, nor vex, nor re∣bel against God's good Spirit in you, nor <Q>walk despite∣fully against the Spirit of grace,</Q> nor turn from it unto wantonness, which would teach you, and bring your sal∣vation. If you do, how can you escape the overflowing scourge of the Almighty, and the wrath of the Lamb? My desires are, that you may all obey God's good Spirit of truth, which will lead you out of all evil into all truth, and reprove you for your own righteousness, and for your own judgment and sin, and bring you to cleave to that which is good, to forsake that which is evil, and to turn to the Lord, who will receive you in his mercy and kindness; by which means you may escape the overflowing scourge in
<PB N="461" REF="037441_0977_100D952064C7AA28"/>the day of vengeance, which dreadful day is coming upon all evil-doers. This is a warning to you, both for your temporal and eternal good; for you to read in your assem∣blies, and your priests in their churches; so that all peo∣ple may hear and fear, as you will answer it at the terrible and dreadful day of judgment.</P>

<HEAD>For the ambassadors that are met to treat for peace at the city of Nimeguen in the States dominions.</HEAD>
<P>CHRIST Jesus saith, <Q>Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God,</Q> Matth. v. 9. so all Christian men are to forsake evil and do good, to seek peace and follow it, if they will <Q>love life, and see good days,</Q> 1 Pet. iii. 11. God hath called all true Christians unto peace, 1 Cor. vii. therefore all Christians ought to follow this peace, which God calls them to. They should let the peace of God rule in all their hearts; which is above the peace of this world that is so soon broken. For the apostle commands the Christians to let the peace of God rule in their hearts; to which all Christians should be subject. The practice of this should be among all that profess Christianity; and this peace is above that which Christ takes from the earth, Rev. vi. which is the peace of the wicked. The apostle faith to Christians. <Q>Be at peace among yourselves.</Q> 1 Thess. v. All Christians should obey this command, and be at peace among them∣selves; not in wars and strife. Further, the apostle ex∣horts Christians to <Q>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</Q> So this unity, this bond of peace should be kept (and not broken) by all that bear that noble name, Christian. They should keep the unity of the Spirit of Christ in the Bond of the Prince of princes, King of kings, and Lord of lords peace, which is the duty of all true Christians. Herein they may honour Christ, in bringing forth the fruits of peace, which are love and cha∣rity. For the apostle tells you, <Q>The fruits of the good Spirit are love, joy, and peace, long-suffering, gentle∣ness, goodness,</Q> &amp;c. Gal. v.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="037441_0978_100D9522E16D6B38"/>
The apostle exhorts Christians, <Q>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceable with all men.</Q> This should be the endeavour of all Christians. For it is no honour to Christ, that Christians should war and destroy one another, that profess the name of Christ, who saith, "He came to save men's lives, not to destroy them." Chris∣tians have enemies enough abroad without them, and therefore they should love one another, as Christ com∣mands, who saith, <Q>By this ye shall be known to be my disciples, if ye love one another.</Q> Christians are com∣manded to love enemies, much more one another. And Christ saith, <Q>As the Father hath loved me, so I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loved you: continue ye in my love,</Q> John xv. 8. <Q>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another,</Q> John xiii. 35. But if Christians war and destroy one another, this will make Jews, Turks, Tartars, and Heathens say, you are not disciples of Christ. Therefore, as you love God, and Christ, and Christianity, and its peace, all make peace, as far as you have power, among Christians, that you may have the blessing. You read, Christians were called the household of faith, the household of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people: and they are commanded to be <Q>zealous for good works,</Q> not for bad. Christians are also command∣ed not to bite and devour one another, lest they be con∣sumed one of another.</P>
<P>Is it not a sad thing for Christians to be biting and con∣suming one another in the fight of the Turks, Tartars, Jews, and heathens, when they should <Q>love one ano∣ther, and do unto all men as they would have men do unto them?</Q> Such devouring work as this will open the mouths of Jews, Turks, Tartars, and heathens to blas∣pheme the name of Christ, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, and cause them to speak evil of Christianity, for them to see how the unity of the Spirit is broken among such as profess Christ and Christ's peace. All Christians are to mind God and Christ's teaching, who teach Chris∣tians to love one another, yea, enemies; and persuade kings and princes to give liberty to all tender consciences in matters of religion and worship, they living peaceably under every government: so that for the time to come there may be no more imprisonment and persecution among Christians for tender consciences about matters of
<PB N="463" REF="037441_0979_100D95247238F6D0"/>faith, worship, and religion, that the Jews, Turks, Tar∣tars, and heathens may not see how Christians are perse∣cuting one another for religion. Seeing from Christ and the apostles Christians have no such command, but, on the contrary, to love one another; and knowing that Christ said to such as would have been plucking up tares, <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harvest (which is the end of the world) lest they plucked up the wheat;</Q> and at the end of the world Christ would send forth his angels, and they should sever the wheat from the tares. So Christ tells you, it is the angels work at the end of the world, and not men's work before the harvest at the end of the world. Hath not all this persecution, banish∣ing, imprisoning, and putting to death concerning reli∣gion, been the pretence of plucking up tares? and hath not all this been before the harvest, before the end of the world? Have not all these been actors against the express command of Christ, the king of heaven? All kings and rulers, especially those that call themselves Christians, should obey their Lord and Saviour's command; <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harvest;</Q> and the harvest is the end of the world. Also Christ told some of his disciples, that would have had <Q>fire to come down from heaven, to destroy such as would not receive him (in their zeal) That they did not know what Spirit they were of:</Q> and rebuked them, saying, <Q>He came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</Q> Have all such as have destroyed men's lives concerning religion, and the worship of God, known what spirit they have been of? Have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y not done that they should not do? That which Christ forbad, who saith, <Q>Lest ye should pluck up the wheat with the tares,</Q> and saith, <Q>It is the angels work at the end of the world?</Q> Hath not God shewed unto man what is good, and his duty, To <Q>love mercy, to do justly, and to walk humbly with his God?</Q> which man is to mind.</P>
<P>And the apostle exhorts Christians to <Q>follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord,</Q> Heb. xii. 14. Why should Christians war and strive one with another, seeing they all own in words one King, and Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, whose command is, that they should "love one another;" which is a mark that they shall be known by, to be Christ's
<PB N="464" REF="037441_0980_100D95266AF6CB68"/>disciples, as I said before. And Christ, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, saith, <Q>As I have loved you, so love one another,</Q> John xv. 12. and John xiii. And the apostle saith, <Q>Christians ought to be patient towards all men,</Q> 1 Thess. v. 14.</P>
<P>From him who is a lover of truth, righteousness, and peace, and desires your temporal and eternal good; and that in the wisdom of God, that is pure, gentle, and peaceable from above, you may be ordered, and order all things God hath committed to you to his glory, and stop those things among Christians, so far as you have power, which dishonour God, Christ, and Christianity!</P>
