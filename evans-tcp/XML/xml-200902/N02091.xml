<HEAD>QUESTION Whether GOD is not Angry with the Country for doing so little towards the Conversion of the <HI>Indians?</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This is spoken to in the following Discourse by the Reverend and Learned Mr. SOLOMON STODDARD of <HI>North-Hampton.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ROM. VIII. 19.</BIBL>
<P><HI>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>PETER</HI> tells us that in <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Epistles there be same things that are hard to be Understood,</HI> and this verse and three following may well be accounted of that number. There are two Interpreta∣tions of this Text and Context, arising from the differing Ex∣position that is given of the word <HI>Creature.</HI> Some by creature do understand the frame of the visible World, consisting of the <HI>Celestial,</HI> and <HI>Elementary</HI> Regions, the <HI>Heavens</HI> with the goodly furniture of Stars, and the <HI>Earth</HI> with its ornaments, and the other Elements. And so they say that the creature; do by a fixed Instinct desire that original perfection wherein they were created which shall be restored to them at the Time of the manifestation of the Sons of God; that is, at the day of Judgment: it follows, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>For the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the some in hope.</HI> The Earth is under a curse, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.17. and the Hea∣vens by their influence do infect the Air: the creatures are subject
<PB N="2" REF="002479_0002_0FDB65B64ED472A0"/>to be ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of man, and are made subject to the lusts of un∣godly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so serve, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, to the good of man and the glory of God v. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God.</HI> That is, that the creature shall be delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this sorrowful estate, and be brought into a better Condition; some of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all be presented after the day of Judgment, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mo∣numents of the Power &amp; Wisdom &amp; Goodness of GOD. It follows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. The Creature doth, as it were, long to be delivered from that Vanity and Bondage: They do wish, even long for the time, when some of every sort shall be delivered.</P>
<P>There be same things that may be objected against this: One is, that the frame of Nature will be destroyed at the day of Judgment: <HI>Psal.</HI> 102.25, 26. speaking of the Earth and the Heavens, he saith, <HI>They shall peris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, yea, all of them shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and they shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> This also is against it, that these Heavens, and the Farth seem to be the place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men shall be punished; 2 Pet. 3.7. <HI>The Hea∣ven &amp; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another Exposition of this Scripture: The foundation of it is that by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is meant the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. so we read of <HI>every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>:</HI> so in the Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the meaning is every Heathen Magistrate: They did not discern Christ explicitely, but they desired the Felicity which is to be had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Christ: therefore Christ is called <HI>the desire of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> The Period was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming, when the Gospel was to be Preached to the Geatiles; now the time should be of manifesting the Sons of God. This was done among the <HI>Jews,</HI> who all pretended to that Title, by the Apostles Preaching to them. It follows. <HI>For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> The Gentiles had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> estate of Ignorance and Idolatry, and vile Courses<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that it seemed impossible they should ever be happy. Tho' it may be understood of God that deserted them, and left them to them∣selves; they were in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of servitude to their lusts. This cames in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it follows, <HI>in hope,</HI> because the Creature it self
<PB N="3" REF="002479_0003_0FDB65BB2F58A2D0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age of Corruption, into the glori∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Children of God. There was some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Gospel, when the <HI>Jews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with it. It follows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>For we know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> It is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Gentiles are very forward to receive the Gospel. While <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> World is as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Christ's time till now; ready to bring forth the Son of God, when the Apostle shall preach to them, Acts 28.28. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. I don't take upon me to determine for this latter interpretation; but supposing it right I observe this Doctrine,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE,</HEAD>
<Q><HI>WHEN the</HI> Jews <HI>rejected the Gospel, God sent it to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and they received it.</HI></Q>
<P>Tho' there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among the <HI>Jews</HI> that waited for Redemption <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>Jews</HI> rejected him. This was fore∣told in the Old Testament, Isa. 53.1, 2. <HI>Who hath believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> report?</HI> And those words are applied to <HI>Israel</HI> by <HI>Paul.</HI> Isai. 65.2. compare Rom. 10.21. <HI>To Israel he saith, as day</HI> long, I have <HI>stretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> saying people.</HI> And long before by <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 2. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. When Christ was here on earth, be foretold that the <HI>Jews</HI> would reject him; Luke 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>They all with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> excuse.</HI> Matth. 12.56. <HI>They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> And presently upon it, God sent it to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and they received it; the Gentiles were under great prejedices by reason of their Education; they had been nursed up in darkness, and addicted to all serts of Wickedness; yet they gave great Entertainment to the Gospel, it was foretold that they would do so. God has promised the heathen unto Christ, Psal. 2.8. <HI>I will give the heathen for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Inheritance.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> reckons many promises together, Rom. 15.10. <HI>Rejoyce ye Gentiles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people.</HI> Ver. 11. <HI>Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles.</HI> 12. <HI>There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and he that shall rise is reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002479_0004_0FDB65BDCEC78608"/>
These promises were abundantly fulfilled, as we have an account in the Acts of the Apostles and in Epistles written to several Churches of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This was represented, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.2. It sell out as it was foretold: Psal. 110.2, 3. <HI>God sent forth the red of his strength out of Zion, and made multitudes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the day of his power.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reas.</HI> Because it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of old. God out of singular love to <HI>Abraham</HI> comforted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the nations of the earth should be blessed in his seed, God delighted in his obedience, and promises that as a reward of it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.18. <HI>Abraham</HI> offered his son to God, and God rewarded him, giving a Son that should be the Saviour of Man∣kind. So God promised it to Christ, as the reward of his Service; the Service that God called him to, was very great, it was a mighty un∣dertaking to lay down his life for Sinners; for the Beloved Son of God to bear the wrath of God! And God promised a large Kingdom as the reward of that Service. Isa. 33.12. <HI>Therefore will I divide him a por∣tion with the great, and he shall divide the spent with the stren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: because be poured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his soul unto death.</HI> Isa 49.6. <HI>It is a light thing with me that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, &amp; to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mayst be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</HI> And long before, He made a promise by <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 9.27. <HI>God shall enlarge Jap et, and he shall dwell in the tents of She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> he shall be incorporated with the Church. There were promises also to the Posterity of <HI>Hom.</HI> Isa. 39.24. <HI>In that day shall Isrect be the third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Egypt, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> &amp;c. God remembred these promises, and shewed himself faithful to perform them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was much for the <HI>Honour</HI> of Christ. God has made him a <HI>King</HI> as well as a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>Priest,</HI> and will give a great Kingdom to him. The Honour of a King is in the multitude of his Subjects, and for his Honour he shall be King of Nations. He suffered a great deal of Repreach upon Earth, and God will make his Name great from the rising to the setting San. Psal. 72.17. <HI>Men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed.</HI> Dan. 2.44, 45. <HI>In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a Kingdom, which shall never be destroyed.</HI> &amp;c. That is greatly for the Honour of Christ, that all Nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ascribe their Redemption to him. Rev. 5.9. <HI>Thou hast re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>emed us to God by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blood, out of all nations.</HI> And ver. 12. <HI>Wor∣thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and riches, and wisdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="002479_0005_0FDB65BF737723F0"/>
2. <HI>It was very much that One Nation should not ingross the Mercy of GOD.</HI> God's Mercy is his <HI>Own,</HI> and He has the liberty to bestow it where he pleases: but there seems to be a condecency in it that He should offer this Grace to all Nations. If Grace had been offered only to the <HI>Jews,</HI> they would have swelled with Pride; and the poor Gen∣tiles would have been discouraged. God is the Father of all Nati∣ons, and it seems most suitable that his Mercy should expatiate it self, that he should show the extensiveness of it: that the Praises of God may refound from all Lands. Rom. 3.29. <HI>Is he the God of the Jews only, is he not also of the Gentiles? yea, of the Gentiles also.</HI></P>
<P>USE. I Of Warning. <HI>That you dont reject the Gospel.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> re∣jected it, and God gave it to other People that brought forth the fruit of it. Now we have the Opportunity, God offers the Gospel to our Nation and unto this Generation; this will be a foundation of eternal Life, if we dont reject it. Let it be your care to receive it: some People have not the offer of it. Do not as the <HI>Jews</HI> did!</P>
<P>There were two things that made them reject it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A spirit of Slumber.</HI> They enjoyed a great deal of ease and out∣ward Prosperity, and fell into a slumbering condition, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.8. they wanted to be awakened to <HI>work out their salvation with fear and trembling:</HI> they set their hearts upon the World, Mat. 22.5. <HI>One had bought a piece of ground, and another had bought five yoke of Oxen, and they must be excused,</HI> Luk. 14.18, 19. A woldly spirit will ruine many men; the reverse to this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of many, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.18. The love of the world besots many; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like to get but little of the world, yet they loose their Souls for the sake of it: The seed of the Gospel is choked with the care of the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.22. Worldly affections eat out their Religion. They say, <HI>It is good to be here;</HI> they do it <HI>seek that City that is to come.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They were Blinded.</HI> Rom. 11.7. besides their natural blindness, <HI>they had a vail upon their bearts,</HI> that was the law; they thought that would save them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. They <HI>went about to establish their own righteousness;</HI> they drunk in a conceit that that would do. They thought they did not need the Blood of a Redeemer, they thought the blood of Sacrifices would serve the turn: so, many among us are blinded with a proud conceit of their own excellency; their eyes are fixed upon that, they dont see their need of Christ, they dont see the glory of Christ. An hundred Arguments wont convince them;
<PB N="6" REF="002479_0006_0FDB65C3ABFC7F80"/>say what you will to them, they think they must have something to commend them: they are strangers to the Freeress of God's Grace, and they are washing of themselves to make themselves clean, and they are adorning of them to make themselves fine &amp; beautiful; You cant beat them out of conceit of themselves. They <HI>think they are some∣thing when they are nothing,</HI> Gal. 6.3. They prise their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and that is an hindrance, to their prising of <HI>CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>USE, II. Of Examination. <HI>Whether GOD is not Angry with the Country for not preaching the Gospel to the Heathen?</HI> That GOD is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the Country, and has been these threescore years, has been evident by His sending <HI>Epidemical Discases</HI> and <HI>Devourers;</HI> And it greatly becomes us to enquire into the Causes of God's Anger: ma∣ny things index are satisfyed in are the cause of Anger: if God is not angry for this; yet there is cause enough of Anger. But we have spe∣cial Reason to enquire whether he is not angry for this; because it is taken notice of in <HI>England,</HI> and we are reflected on in Print, that we have little care of the Heathen; it was miles notice of above Forty Years ago. Another creation for enquiry i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I hat God has made them a <HI>terrible</HI> scourge to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that by their joyning with the <HI>French;</HI> and in this present Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: These Wars have been very expensive, and bloody, and have made many Towns desolate, and many times the affliction carries the token of the sin; by the <HI>Punishment,</HI> sometimes Men may learn the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They are instruments to punish us, it may be we have not done our duty to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST Commands us to Preach the Gospel to them.</HI> The Country is not lest at liberty, whether they will cause the Gospel to be preached unto them; it is not a matter of indifference, whether they will do it, or neglect it. I readily acknowledge that the <HI>Indians</HI> have shewed a very br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tish and settish spirit; that where a people lived among them that made a great profession of Religion, they did not enquire into it whether the Doctrine that they professed was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or not. They plainly manifested that they had very much of litera∣ted the light of Nature: and made no tolerable use of their natural Conscience, that taught them that there was a glorious GOD, that made the World, that was to be worshipped and served; and that their Souls were Immortal. But that is no excuse or us; the com∣mand of Christ to his Disciples was, <HI>To French the Gospel to every</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002479_0007_0FDB65C493D5D5C8"/><HI>Creature,</HI> Mark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.15. And to <HI>Go and teach all Nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Mat. 28.19. This Command was not given to the Apostles alone, but to their Suc∣cessors also throughout all generations, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> follows, v. 20. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I am with ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alway, even unto the end of the world.</HI> Hence it is evident, That it is the Mind of Christ, that Christian People as they have Op∣portunity, do in all Generations, Labour to Christianize the Heathen. It is Expec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from those that are in Authority, who have Power to send Preachers, and to Maintain and Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st them in doing their Work; to take Effectual Care that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospel be Published. In the Time of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, this was not so required; for the Ordi∣nances of God at that time were fitted only for <HI>One</HI> National Church: The Ceremmonial Law was as a partition wall between the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> The Church-state was fitted to <HI>One</HI> Nation: and yet the <HI>Jews</HI> did take a great deal of care to Proselyte the Heathen and to bring them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knowledge of the True God. And there were many Proselytes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong them as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And the <HI>Jews</HI> that after the Captivity were Dispersed among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> did bring many of them to the Profession of the True God, as we find in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the Apostles. And when the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Princes had Subdned the <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites,</HI> they Compelled them to be Circumcised, and to make a Profession of the true God. But now we are under an Express Command to Teach all Nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Honour of JESUS CHRIST.</HI> We make a Profethos of Honouring him we know that He is Worthy of Honour, Rev. 5.12. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Lamb that was stain, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> It would have been well worth the while, for us to have honoured Christ in this way. A Spirit of Love to Christ, would have put us upon it to have Advanced his Honour in this way. Peo∣ple are wont to be concerned for the Honour of their Princes. An Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> was wonderfully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffected when he saw <HI>Alexander</HI> sit on the throne of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> This is one of the Honours Promised unto JESUS CHRIST, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. 72.17. <HI>And that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Psal. 2.8. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> Phil. 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And it would greatly have becomed us to have laid out our slves for the Accomplishment of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. We owe more than this to Jesus Christ. And it would have been a great Consolation, to see there
<PB N="8" REF="002479_0008_0FDB65C6E6E38D18"/><HI>Indians,</HI> who had Worshipped the Devil, meeting together to Praise and Glorify CHRIST, and to hear them Discoursing of the Wonder∣ful Love of God, in sending his Son to Dy for us. David rejoyced in that <HI>Men should abundantly utter the memory of his great goodness; and sing of his Righteousness,</HI> Psal. 145.7. And if a Spirit of Love to Jesus Christ had flourished in us, it would be the Joy of our Hearts, to see Congregations of <HI>Indians</HI> waiting on God in his House, joyning in Prayer, and hearing the Gospel, and Celebrating the Memory of the Death of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We ought to have done it out of Love to Mankind.</HI> Christ Jesus Died For the Saltation of Sinners, and it is a great thing <HI>to Save a Soul from Death,</HI> Jam. 5.20. It is matter of Humbling to think of the Damnation of Men, and to see Men go Ignorantly on in a way of Destruction. Our Hearts should yearn towards these Poor Heathen; it becomes us to Commiserate their Condition. It is a doleful thing to think, that from generation to generation, they go down to Hell. We know that none is able to bear it, to <HI>dwell with dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Fire, To dweil with ever∣lasting Burnings.</HI> And we should not think much of it, to be at some Expence for to Redeem Men from Destrustion. It is very great kindness to help Men to Heaven. It will be as intolerable for these Heathen to bear the Torments of Hell, as for any of us to bear them. And as we dread to go to Hell our selves, it should be awful to us to consider their Damnation. Love and Pity calls for it, that we should help them out of their Danger. We should pity <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in Misery, much more <HI>Men:</HI> Tho they be Brutish Persons; yet, they are of Mankind, and so objects of Compassion. It is an act of Love to our own nature to seek their Salvation: If we can further that, we shall do them great Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Profession of those that Adventured into this Country was, that it was their principal design, to bring the</HI> Indians <HI>to the knowlege of the true God and Saviour of Mankind, and the Christian Faith;</HI> as the King declares in the Charter: The like is expressed in the Charter for <HI>Connections.</HI> And it would have been the Honour of the Country, if they had answered that Profession. Indeed we gave the Heathen an Example; and if they had not been miserably besotted, they would have taken more notice of it. But we have done very little to Answer our Pro∣fession. Some few pious persons, of their own accord, have taken some Pains, and had some Success. And some Money that has been
<PB N="9" REF="002479_0009_0FDB65C85515CBF0"/>contributed in <HI>England</HI> for the furtherance of that Design, has been faithfully expended that way: But the Country has been at very lit∣tle Cost for the Conversion of the Heathen. Many Men have been more careful to make a booty of them, than to gain them to the practice of Religion. It puts me to a stand to conjecture what Excuse can be made for this Neglect. The Poverty of the Country will be no Apology for this Omission. We have great cause to be humbled, that we have answered our profession so poorly.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We our selves have been pitied, when we were in the like condition.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Nation was formerly under heathenish darkness, as these <HI>Indians;</HI> they worshipped several Idols, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Woden, Thor</HI> and <HI>Frea.</HI> But there were those that pitied them, and brought the Gospel among them;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Britanis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Our Fore fathers in this Nation were given up unto as bruitish a Service of the Devil, as any Nation under the Sun. It is therefore an Effect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the Day hath dawned on us poor Gertiles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3.5. — 1c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Medit on the Glory of CHRIST. p. 23.</NOTE> and tho' it was mixed with some Errors; and it was about Two hundred Years before they were all brought to a steady Profession of Chrissianity, and soon after they declined to Popery; yet the issue has been such, through the over ruling Hand of God, that we have cause to count it the greatest Mercy, that ever the Land did enjoy. Hereby God has laid a foundation for the Salva∣tion of many Thousands of Souls; and God has raised up many Men that have been the glory of the Nation, and many that have suffered Martyrdom for the Faith of the Gospel. And what ever Declensions there be at the present; yet the Gospel is professed, and there is great Opportunity to come to Eternal Life. We should have been so sensible of this Mercy of God to us, as to pity these <HI>Indians,</HI> not know∣ing but that God may have glorious Churches among them, and that in length of time, many of their Posterity may be glorious Witnesses unto Christ, and that His Kingdom may flourish among them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Examples of Others may make us A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed.</HI> Besides what has been done by the <HI>English</HI> formerly in sending Preachers into <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> there is at this day a great deal done in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> by the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> for the Propagation of the Gospel. Worthy Men are sent over; many are brought to the Profession of the Faith; the
<PB N="10" REF="002479_0010_0FDB65CDDD982FE8"/>Bible is Printed in their own Language; great Contributions are sent over to advance that Work; and the Name of Christ i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> renowned among them; and the people that have been in Darkness have seen great Light. And it is matter of Shame, that when others are carry∣ing the Gospel many thousands of Miles, from their own Country; We suffer them that dwell among us, and that are Bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erers to us; to lie in Darkness, and Afford them very little Help for their De∣liverance.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The Activity of Papists for the spreading of their Religion, may greatly ashame us.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have done a great deal to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> to their Religion: And the <HI>Portagueze.</HI> to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Brazil,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> to theirs. And the <HI>French,</HI> are diligent in <HI>Canada,</HI> and else where, to gospellize them. And do we fit still, without any hearty Endeavours for the Salvation of the Heathen among us? It may be said, they do them little service to bring them from one error to another; to take them out of the <HI>Pit.</HI> and lead them into a <HI>Snare.</HI> But however, they therein make Con∣science to advance their own Religion; run great Ventures, and en∣dare many Hardships, in order to it. And is it not a Shame to us to be backward to promote the true Religion? If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Zeal, and Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and vain glory, have a mighty influence upon them; it might be ex∣pected that Love to God, and the Souls of Men, should stir up us to Propagate the Truth. We have abundantly more Reason to lay out our selves for the Truth; than others have, for their Errors and Su∣perstitious doctrines.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If they should imbrace Religion, it would be a means to make them live more comfortably in this World.</HI> It is observable, that many Na∣tions, when they were in their Heathenism, lived miserably as to this World. So the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> and others; But since their imbracing the Gospel, they are got into a flourishing condition. God leads them in ways of wisdom, to follow <HI>Husbandry, Trades</HI> and <HI>Merchandize,</HI> and to live honourably and plentifully. They have good Honses, handsome Clothing, and comfortable Diet; they live more like Men than they did in former Ages. It is said Christ is worthy of <HI>Riches,</HI> Rev. 5.12. God bestows them on Christ two ways, one is in giving Riches for the maintaining the Ordinances of Christ; the other is in giving Riches to the Professors of the Christian Reli∣gion. And it is very hopeful, if the <HI>Indians</HI> did once imbrace the true
<PB N="11" REF="002479_0011_0FDB65CF11AC3B20"/>Religion, they would by degrees, leave off their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ild and base way of living; learn Trades, improve Land; and govern themselves as civi∣lized Nations do; they would relinquish this Savage way of living that they have been addicted unto.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>If they should imbrace Religion, it might provoke us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> We make an high Profession; but yet Religion runs low, and Iniquity doth abound. There is a great deal of Pride, Drunkenness, Injustice, Prophanness, and <HI>Korais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the Land. And we need to say as <HI>David; Wilt thou not revive us again?</HI> Psal. 85.6. It is the conjecture of one learned Writer, that the Christians in <HI>America</HI> will <HI>Indianize</HI> and be∣came that <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> spoken of, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. I hope that will prove a Mistake. But if the <HI>Indians</HI> were prevailed with to receive the Gospel, it is hopeful, their Zeal may provoke us. If we observe a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Faith, and Love, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; it may make us ashamed, and provoke us to Emulation. <HI>Paul</HI> hoped that the Conversion of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> would provoke the <HI>Jews</HI> to Emula∣tion, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.12. Its hopeful, if Religion should prevail among them, it may be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Revive it among us.</P>
<P>USE III. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for that it is a very desirable thing that the Heathen be brought to the Faith.</HI> There be many Promises of the Conversion of the Gentil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Isa.</HI> 47.6. And it has been Graciously Accomplished many times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Nations are brought to Receive the Gospel, so they do it with Sincerity: and so they will be Blessed for ever, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.18. Private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons may help it forward, by their Prayers, as well as others; We should Pray for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That will be for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than only to make Peace.</HI> If they continue in their Heathenism, there will be occasion of contention: There was abundance of Trouble between <HI>Israel</HI> and the <HI>Heathen</HI> that were about them: if they continue <HI>Heathens</HI> they will be apt to fall in with the <HI>Papists;</HI> if they continue <HI>Heathens,</HI> they will carry it Pro∣vokingly; if they be contentious, they will be ready to run to Arms, and avenge themselves by making War: But if they be brought to Religion, then there will be Hopes of a Durable Peace: The People of <HI>Ekron</HI> fell out often with <HI>Israel;</HI> but when they were Con∣verted, they were Serviceable and Helpful to them; Zech. 9.7. <HI>Ekron shall be as a Jebusite.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="002479_0012_0FDB65D08F9810C0"/>
2. <HI>That will be much better, than to Destroy them.</HI> Some men it their Rage, meditate nothing but utter Destruction; They <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Fire-brands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Death.</HI> They are like <HI>Edom,</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> that said, <HI>Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them off from being a Nation, that the Name of Israel may be us m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in Remembrance,</HI> Psal. 83.4.
