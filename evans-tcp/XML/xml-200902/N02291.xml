<HEAD>Deputy Governour <HI>Jenks</HI>'s PROCLAMATION <HI>Answered,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING lately received a Copy of an unaccountable PROCLA∣MATION predicated upon the Legal Punishment of some No∣torious Offenders at <HI>Norwich</HI> in <HI>July</HI> last) issued out by the Honourable <HI>Joseph Jenks,</HI> Dep. Governour, and ordered to be Ex∣posed to publick View in the Town of <HI>Providence;</HI> And humbly supposing it to proceed from a wrong Principle in the Author, as well as his mistaken apprehension of the matter of Fact alledg'd as the occasion of it; as also Judging it to be of a dangerous &amp; pernicious Consequence to the Common People in respect of the most Important Concerns:</P>
<P>I Tho't my self oblig'd (at the Importunity of some people about Providence) to make a publick Reply to it, both to rectify the Mistakes of the Author, vindicate my proceedings in that matter; And in a word to give a true Declara∣tion of the whole Case, undeceive the World
<PB N="2" REF="002726_0004_0FE61488081A9D90"/>and deliver people from the unjust Prejudices which they have conceiv'd against our Govern∣ment, Religion and Ministers by said Proclama∣tion</P>
<P>And for as much as the Author of it was not so Just to the common Interest, Kind to him∣self or Civil to me, as to desire an account of the true state of the matter to Regulate his Judgment by; But upon the bare Inspection of one Copy of Record, and the Information (as I suppose) of one of the Incens'd offenders, without knowing the Notorious Aggravating Circumstances of their offence; hath proceeded to this Publick Method of Advocacy for those offenders: Let none wonder, that I omit a Pri∣vate Letter to Him, and take this method as in the following Essay, which is now become ne∣cessary for our Vindication &amp; Defence: where in, I shall be Mercifull, as before, &amp; use as much moderation, as I Think the nature of the Cause will admit of.</P>

<HEAD>The Preface to the Proclamation.</HEAD>
<P>HERE followeth a Copy of a Record of the Proceedings of a Justices Court Held in Norwich in <HI>July</HI> last; with one of John Rogers his Brethren who to
<PB N="3" REF="002726_0005_0FE614881A8B70D0"/>gether with him and several others, I am Informed were going on the First Day of the Week from New-London and Groton to a religious meeting at Lebanon, in or∣der to Baptize, or see a person Baptized, &amp; were all apprehended as Malefactors and unmercifully Whip't.</P>

<P>The REPLY to it.</P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P>First, This Honourable Proclamator says truly that the Person here Named was one of John Ro ers's <HI>Brethren;</HI> being such by Visible Pro∣fession, and no less evidently such in iniquity &amp; Trans ressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n as thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions uncon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibly de∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st ate. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith truly, the were Tra∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Week from New∣London and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and as they own'd with a design <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Lebanon, and all this as perniciously as needlesly shall be made Evident.</P>
<P>In this place it will not be amiss to tell the World who were the Brethren of this <HI>John Rogers,</HI> from their Relation to whom they are here mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with that distinguishing mark of Ho∣nour, or rather (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you please) Infamy. The names of them all, are with <HI>John Rogers; John Bolls,</HI> &amp; <HI>Joseph Bolls,</HI> from <HI>New-London: John Culver, Andrew Davis, James Smith: John Water∣house,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sarah Culver</HI> (the singing Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to make up the Solemn Community) from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> All of them (for ought appears) in their own Imagination Equally ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with an Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olical
<PB N="4" REF="002726_0006_0FE61489D2AC1EF0"/>Commission &amp; Authority; for the account here given, says not, but that they were equally con∣cerned in the Administration of Baptism their pretended business at Lebanon: and knew not who should be immediately called to do it, when they came there. There was not any one a∣mong them that pretended to be an Officer more than the rest, and surely their general design to officiate without knowing that it be∣long'd to any of them, argues them very Ignorant or unbelieving of that text, Heb. 5.4. <HI>And no man taketh this Honour unto himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.</HI> Any Body may guess what a religious Meeting they were like to have, who thus Presumptuously designed a So∣lemn Thing, without any Real and Manifest call from God.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P><HI>In the next Place,</HI> He don't say Justly, that this Brother, (viz) <HI>Andrew Davis,</HI> was Travelling <HI>together</HI> with John Rogers; for they came in distinct Companies from their respective Places, and came into Town at a different Time, and this so exactly according to the Visible aspect of their common Design, in the whole; as if it were ordered on purpose, that one company might Disturb the People as they were returning at Noon from the more publick Exercise; and the other, the Residue that were about an Hour after returning from the Sacramental Solemnity (it being the Day for that special Attendance) But whatever they design'd by such a critical
<PB N="5" REF="002726_0007_0FE61489DBF8B4A0"/>timing of their Travel thro' the Streets; or whither it was purely Accidental: It seem'd to be the more Insolent in them (when they might have gone another way) and was the more Disturbing and Offensive to us The first Com∣pany bringing a Chair with them to aggravate the offence, and some of the other Company calling out to the People, <HI>Did ye not hear, There is a solemn Ordinance to be Administred to morrow upon a Person at Lebanon, According to Christs Institution?</HI> Neither of which could be necessary to the peaceable Enjoyment of their own perswasion, but designed as I justly suppose to give the great∣er Disturbance to our usual quietness on the Sabbath. And tho' it cannot be justly tho't a matter of Conscience in them to come to us, in such Time and Manner, when they knew it was contrary to the Law of the Government, and would be offensive to us, the troublesome con∣sequents of which they might have spared them∣selves, and us from, without any Injury to their Religion (if it may be so called.) Yet I think we are obliged to take due notice of them, when they did so come, except we might tame∣ly resign up the sacredness of the Sabbath, and our peaceable Enjoyment of it, and forbid our Consciences and the Laws of God and Man to Express their just resentments of such daring Iniquity committed against all Order &amp; Reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion; The neglect of which resentments, would but strengthen these people in their Insolence, and Expose both our Religion and Laws to all Con∣tempt, <PB N="6" REF="002726_0008_0FE6149436E29D08"/>And if this instance of their Transgression had passed unobserved and unpunished, we have just reason to Conclude, that they would have soon proceeded to give us disturbance in the Publick Worship of the Sabbath, as they have others in the Neighbourhood, by Rushing into their Assemblies with all Clamour and Contra∣diction, and Superfluity of Naughtiness.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Their Honourable Advocate don't do fairly to insinuate, as tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were designed for Lebanon to attend a religious Meeting there on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Day, as that it hath been received by the People in &amp; about Providence: For by their own Confession they design'd to attend that the <HI>Second</HI> or <HI>Third</HI> Day of the Week; And therefore since they did not intend to have their religious Meet∣ing on the Sabbath, &amp; any other Day would have Accomodated their design (who own no Sab∣bath) as well as that Day: It must be Supposed that they chose this Day to Travel near <HI>Thirty</HI> Miles, for nothing in the World but to Express their Malicious Abhorrence of the Sabbath and to disturb hose who Religiously observe it, as also to bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defiance to the Law injoyning the observation of it, as by their own Confession will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently appear, And what Mortal can solve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch an unscriptural and no less irrational Contradiction? Is there any Law of Nature or revealed Prescript under Heaven that bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds
<PB N="7" REF="002726_0009_0FE614944508ECD8"/>Mens Consciences to such Absudicies? And yet they pretend Conscience in what they do, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in plain terms, to make Conscience of doing Iniquity, and what Conscience this is, &amp; whence it is informed. Let all (save the blackned World,) Judge.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> He ingeniously owns, a cording to his Information, that they scarcely knew their busi∣ness when they shou'd come <HI>there.</HI> It was (says he) <HI>In order to baptize or to see a person baptiz'd,</HI> &amp; I may add, &amp; they knew not what: They knew not it seems who, or whether any of them, was to baptize or whether any person wou'd be bap∣tized; and so it proved the next time, when they actually went to Lebanon under the same pre∣tence: Baptism was not administred, there was no Subject, or no Officer, or they were Indifferent about it, however zealous in pretence before. Wherefore, it appears that their Infallible Spirit doth sometimes deceive them, as it did their Great <HI>Apostle</HI> the late <HI>John Rogers;</HI> who pretended from the Inspirations of it, that he was proof against all Infection of Body (as well as mind,) which the Wicked only (he said) were susceptible of, and to put the matter upon trial, daringly ventured into Boston in the time of the Small Pox. But re∣ceived the Infection and Dyed of it, with seve∣ral of his Family, taking it from him; so the Trial of his Impassibility issued. More Instances of their Deception might be mentioned, But 'tis Enough here to Instance in this relating to the present
<PB N="8" REF="002726_0010_0FE614954F3FBF60"/>Case, for it seems their Spirit (notwithstanding all their pretences to Certain Immediate Directi∣on by it (did not tell them what was their Business at Lebanon, any more than it did what should be their Sufferings at Norwich, which it did not, in∣as much as they Expected according to their In∣solent Boast to buy our Sabbaths for five shillings a piece, but finding them risen in the Price, yet with a greater Liberty granted to offenders than they used to have, They (without any previous advices from their Spirit) did wilfully chuse the Corporal Punishment, rather than the Expence of Money, and to the wonder of all sober Men were more sparing of their Purses than of their Backs. But there might be this in it, to determine their Choice, according to their Boast of Extraordinary defence, they Expected to feel no pain, and so they would have saved their Backs and Money too, but they were evidently Disappointed and fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing the less for the cause. And then they hoped to acquire to theselves the Honour of Martyrs, &amp; gain some Proselytes by their Coura∣gious Suffering as they pretended for the sake of Christ, but were also disappointed in this, and I believe got no more Honour than ease by their foolish choice. Which makes me think how wittily a Lawyer ridicul'd the folly of one of these Suffer∣ers, who declared that he wou'd not for the sake of <HI>Fifty Pound,</HI> (or a greater Sum) Endure the same again, &amp; yet chearfully endured this in hope of a reward in the other World, who was told of his sad <HI>mistake</HI> &amp; <HI>poor bargain;</HI> In short, at most he coudn't
<PB N="9" REF="002726_0011_0FE614955893D308"/>expect more than the value of <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> since that was the full Price of his Scourge; and with that he might have escaped it, without any damage to his Religion. And it appeared by their whole Management that their hearts were more upon their Travel, &amp; <HI>Contempt of the Sabbath,</HI> than upon their <HI>Religious Meeting,</HI> which shews that the very end and design of their first motion was to Offend &amp; Disturb us; For when they had done this, and got their Backs whip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for it, they were content to return back again yea to Prison, rather than pay the just Charges of their Prosecu∣tion, and proceed to their Religious Meeting at Lebanon, which they might have done, if they would. Hence,</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I may boldly confess, that they were apprehended as <HI>Malefactors</HI> and punished as such, and speak of it with a humble Assurance that all Sober Unprejudiced Men will Justify what was done, as they receive the full History of the mat∣ter. Let the World Judge, whether they were not Notorious Malefactors and worthy of App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣hension and Stripes, which after Legal Prosecution and Trial, they had, But <HI>not</HI> Unmercifully, either in respect of <HI>any Imposition</HI> thereof upon them, as was before hinted (for by their Resolute Choice, they constrained me to Order this Pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hment, or disregard the Law; so that in a Moral &amp; Pro∣per Sense, they Whip'd their own Back, and may Thank themselves for it; and ought not to Com∣plain of our Unmercifulness towards them) or, in respect of the <HI>Instrument,</HI> being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Single Cord
<PB N="10" REF="002726_0012_0FE6149B73C835D8"/>without a Knot in it, or in respect of the <HI>Number</HI> of Stripes not exceeding Ten, (Except upon one for a very good reason) when they all might have Legally received more, or finally, in respect of the <HI>force</HI> of the Application, for I stood by and saw every Stroke, and discovered not a drop of Blood, save only from some Strokes with the End of the Whip under the Arm of some of them,—And put cularly concerning the Woman which hath been Represented as the most Eminent Sufferer, &amp; the Cruelty aggravated in respect of a special Circumstance, I tho's it just to the cause of our Defence, to say, that she received the slende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Scourge of them all, and that in favour of her tender Sex, but not at all in regard to a state of <HI>Pregnancy,</HI> being justly supposed as free of that, as the Post <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he so wilfully Embraced. And farther, I saw no persons Insult them, or Triumph in their Correction, But the whole multitude of Specta∣tors with a becoming aspect of Grief, at their wretched Delusion Folly and Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness, gravely looked on, wondring that any Persons should thus obstinately chuse their own Misery &amp; yet pre end it was Suffering for their Consciences and Religi∣on. And tho' it was not gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eful to a Humane Principle, to see Creatures, in humane sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe, Suf∣fer Stripes, yet it was Enough to raise a Holy In∣dignation at their Wild, unscriptural Zeal, to hear such clamorous Invocations of the Name of God &amp; Christ, for Assistance and Support, in a Cause so contrary to Religion; as if they were wholly lost to Humanity &amp; the Remains of Natural Light</P>

I am Confident, there's nothing of this Nature, to Argue that we han't the Spirit of GOD.</P>

<P>And I must observe, that notwithstand∣ing the Presbyterian pretended Zeal to a strict observation of a First Day Sabbath was such, that those poor people might not be suffered to Travel from <HI>Groton</HI> to <HI>Leba∣non</HI> on that Day, on a Religious Occasion, as hath been minded, but must be appre∣hended, as gross Malefactors, and Unmer∣cifully Punished, yet when a Presbyterian Minister which hath had a great Fame for Abilities, hath been to Preach in the Town of Providence, why truly then the Presby∣terians have come flocking in upon the First Day of the Week to hear him from <HI>Rehoboth</HI> and the furtherest parts of <HI>Attle∣borough</HI> and from <HI>Killingsly,</HI> which is much further than <HI>John Rogers</HI> and his Friends were Travelling, and this may pass for a Godly Zeal; But the other must be Punished for a Sinful Action. Oh! the Partiality of such Nominal Christians.</P>

<P><HI>REPLY,</HI></P>
<P><HI>And I must Observe too,</HI> That the pretended Reasonings of this Anti presbyterian, seems to
<PB N="29" REF="002726_0031_0FE614D6C9FD9630"/>me, as <HI>Strange,</HI> as his Regard to the Professed Sabbath and Publick Peace, does <HI>Indifferent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because he wou'd Argue in favour of his Clients Travel on the Sabbath from their T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣vel, who out of the Adjacent Towns to <HI>Provi∣dence,</HI> came there, on the Sabbath Day. Or, because he would fasten the Guilt of Partiality upon us, in Punishing the former, and not see∣ing to it that the latter were also Punished, tho' out of our Province.</P>
<P>These things may be said to shew the Weak∣ness of his Reasoning.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Cases are not Parallel; For these <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> were Travelling upon the Sabbath but with no design to have their Religious Meeting on that Day, as hath been shewed from their own Confession: They came too in Contempt of the Sabbath, and in Defiance to the law, as hath also been shewed. Moreover, They had their Preacher with them (it there was to be any at all) and their Assembly mostly with them and might have held their Meeting at either Place from whence they came But these <HI>Presbyte∣rians</HI> he speaks of, came on the Sabbath to At∣tend a Religious Meeting on that Day came not in Contempt of the Sabbath &amp; Defiance of the Law, and Came <HI>To</HI> the Preacher.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="002726_0032_0FE614DB88A5A368"/>
2. If their Cases were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or however far those Presb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terians might be guilty in I ravel∣ling out of their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laces needlesly, &amp; meerly out of Curiosity, is it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tho' I am credi∣bly Informed those that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emo'e came to <HI>Providence</HI> on the Saturday] is did not belong to us to Punish them, to be sure not all of them. We have Puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed our known Offenders and if we had look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to their Punishing their Offen∣ders, we might have been Charged indeed of getting the Rule over them.</P>
<P>But again,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> His Reasonings appear strange, be∣cause he would prove our Zeal a pretended Zeal from those things that are Visible Evidences of its Sincerity.</P>
<P><HI>Their pretended Zea'</HI> (says he (<HI>to a strict obser∣vation of a first DaySa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th was such</HI>— Insinuating as though we were Hypocrites, for no other Reason, but because we profess a strict observa∣tion of the Sabbath, punish those that travel on purpose to profane the Sabbath, and don't pu∣nish those that travel on purpose to attend the Worship of God on that Day; And so the sum of the matter is represented thus, that when we do all we can to preserve the Honour of the Sabbath, both by punishing those that profane the Day, and by taking pains ourselves to attend the Worship of God on that Day, this sheweth our Zeal, to be but a pretence, whenas if we
<PB N="31" REF="002726_0033_0FE614DB94006068"/>had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fither we might have deserved he Imputation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, Body hear such Rea∣soning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that a Gent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f such Fame for Understanding as the <HI>Honourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> should give us the Cha∣racte of <HI>Nominal Christians</HI> from such grounds as These whenas, if having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Laws to injoin the observation of the Day which we believe and prote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be the Christian Sabbath, and ha∣ving Authority to put these Laws in Execution, we thou'd neglect to observe it ourselves or to puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those that take pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns to pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in defiance of the Law, we might Justly be term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Nominal</HI> and <HI>But</HI> Nominal Christians.</P>
<P>Our Authors Reasoning appears the more strange because it comes from One that hath such a Spirit of discerning; Even to he discer∣ning of Spirits, for he seems to Conclude that we have not much of the Spirit of God But what if he shou'd improve his sagacious faculty <HI>reflectively,</HI> and Consider whether the Spirit that moved to the sitting up of a Proclamation to incense the Inhabitants of Providence against the Good Ministers that have been (with much self Denyal) labouring their Good; be like the Spirit of God, Or, that spirit which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter'd into the swine and drove them into the Sea, that the People of that Country might be so disturb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at Christ, who came there to do them Good, as to send him out of their Coasts? Oh the Mistakes of such Nominal Rulers.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002726_0034_0FE614DEE7B4CB80"/>
To Conclude. I must Profess I'm Sorry that by this Proclamation there has been given any occasion for this Reply and Vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, and that herein there has been need of any Expres∣sions which may seem somewhat harsh, unless they are resolved into he Evident Extremity of the occasion, and which otherwise wou'd have been far from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho't, It is desireable that this Gentleman do seriously con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der his Mistake and in a proper manner retract it, and we shall be ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreive his unjust Censures, and think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him with a respect befitting the Digni∣ty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his station. I wish also that the People in Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idence or elsewhere, would be Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious that he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no means be Prejudiced against the Ministers and so be kept from Embracing Re∣ligion which will be fatal need — let what has been here offered, be candidly accep∣ted, as meant for the Defence of Truth and Justice, which should be dear to all Men.</P>
