<P>BUT has this Pious MARY any <HI>Daugh∣ters</HI> in <HI>our Dayes</HI> to be found among <HI>our selves?</HI> Any Admirers and Fol∣lowers of <HI>Her</HI> Exemplary Piety? It may not be made a Question of. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublick Admonitions to do like MARY, in <HI>Chu∣sing the Good Part,</HI> will come with a <HI>Good Force,</HI> if we can show a MARY, (or a SARAH) in our very Neighbourhood, of whom we might say▪ <HI>Behold, An Exemple of doing so!</HI> Certainly, there are such Handmaids of the Lord among the <HI>Daughter of our Zion:</HI> And as there were Three <HI>Maries</HI> to One <HI>John,</HI> under the <HI>Cross</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ I wish, <HI>my Sex</HI> were not near as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

done in the Number of them that make <HI>Choice</HI> of that Precious LORD. Among the <HI>Daughters that have thus done Vertuously,</HI> I can say to my Hearers, that such an one was this Day Se'nnight with us in the Congregation, like a devout MARY, <HI>Un∣weariedly</HI> listening, as she use to be, unto the Word of God. But she is now flown away to that Congre∣gation, where God is Worshipped, not only with∣out <HI>Weariness,</HI> but also without any Infirmity, without any Imperfection. It is fit, that such a <HI>Mother in Israel,</HI> should be spoken of; and there is now an opportunity for it, in the Presence and Audience of a GENERAL ASSEMBLY of our <HI>Israel.</HI> It was her Excellent Character for Pru∣dence and Goodness, and particularly for her I∣mitation of the Celebrated MARY, in a Constant, Awful, Affectionate Attention to the Word of God, that has carried me away to a Theme, on which I need say nothing (nor <HI>shall</HI> I,) but what was to be Read in her Holy Conversation. I am sure, This will be a way of <HI>Womens Teaching in the Church,</HI> which the Apostle never disapproved of! And we may now confirm an Observation, That the <HI>Word</HI> of God it self sometimes comes in as a Recompence and an Instrument of <HI>Honour</HI> unto them who have <HI>Honoured</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> with a more than ordinary Diligence, and Attention.</P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST was Entertained at the House of <HI>Martha,</HI> in <HI>Bethany,</HI> who had her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ister <HI>Mary</HI> living with her. Of these Two Sister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was lothe to leave the Room, while the
<PB REF="001217_0004_0FB12FF46F34C720"/>
Lord Jesus Christ was there uttering the blessed Mysteries of our Salvation; but <HI>Martha</HI> was very busy in providing a civil &amp; handsome Treat for so high a Guest, and complained, that the other was unkind, in thus leaving her alone, to provide what was <HI>Needful.</HI> The Answer of our Lord unto this Complaint has two things in it. First, <HI>Martha</HI> is Advised; That she overdid in her Care, about External matters; and our Lord convinces her of her over-doing, by advising her, That there is <HI>One Thing more Needful,</HI> than all those things about which we are prone to be too careful. Second∣ly, <HI>Mary</HI> is Commended, for the <HI>Choice</HI> that she had made. And this <HI>Choice</HI> is commended, first, from the <HI>Object</HI> of it. A <HI>Good Part.</HI> The Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself; the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; the <HI>Mercy</HI> proposed in the <HI>Gospel;</HI> This was the <HI>Good Portion,</HI> that she had chosen. And then, from the <HI>Effect</HI> of it. It should not be <HI>taken away</HI> from her, nor should she be <HI>taken away</HI> from that; Her possession of what she had <HI>Chosen</HI> should be perpetual. Will my Hearers, and very particularly the Sex whose Laudable Zeal, gave an occasion for our Text to be found in the Bible, now receive a DOCTRINE of the Greatest Importance in the world? It was re∣ceived, and it was most practically and admirably illustrated, by that Excellent Person, whom in my whole Discourse, you may, if you please, think me all along speaking of.</P>

<P>There is a <HI>GOOD PORTION,</HI> that is Chosen by every Good Christian; and this <HI>GOOD PORTION</HI> is never to be taken away from them that Choose it</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The First Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>There is a <HI>Good Portion</HI> propounded unto the <HI>Choice</HI> of men, in the <HI>Word</HI> of God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Word</HI> of God, is it self a <HI>Good Word.</HI> When <HI>Mary</HI> Chose (as <HI>Ours</HI> also did, above all the De∣lights upon Earth,) to attend upon the <HI>Word</HI> of God, she <HI>Chosen Good Part.</HI> But there is this especial∣ly <HI>Good</HI> in the <HI>Word</HI> of God; It Exhibit a <HI>Good part</HI> unto our Choice. Man is a Dependent creature▪ He depends upon God for satisfaction. Every man seeks a <HI>Portion;</HI> that is is to say, an <HI>Happiness</HI> wherein he may be satisfied. That Enjoyment, wherein God will give men to find satisfaction is, a <HI>Good Portion</HI> for them. In the <HI>Word</HI> of God, we have such a satisfying <HI>Portion</HI> set before us.</P>
<P>But, <HI>What is that <HI>Good Portion?</HI></HI></P>
<P>In General; The <HI>Good Portion</HI> is the same that our Lord JESUS CHRIST has pronounced <HI>The One Thing that is Needful.</HI> Our Lord having said, <HI>One Thing is Needful,</HI> then adds, <HI>Mary has Chosen that Good Portion.</HI> But now, <HI>The One Thing that is Needful,</HI> is, Our SALVATION by our Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST. Of all things the most <HI>Necessary</HI> for us, is that <HI>Eternal Salvation,</HI> whereof our Lord</P>

<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> An Interest in the Lord JESUS CHRIST is a <HI>Good Portion:</HI> What Christian does not count it his best Interest? Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is often called, <HI>The Good One,</HI> and, <HI>The Good Thing. A Fountain</HI> of all <HI>Good,</HI> must needs be a <HI>Good Portion.</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI> is not more a <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> then our Lord JESUS CHRIST is a <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Good.</HI> Men count they have a <HI>Good Portion,</HI> when they have <HI>Riches</HI> enough. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Person that has the Lord JESUS CHRIST <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Portion,</HI> has <HI>Riches</HI> enough, We read, Eph.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.7. about, <HI>The unsearchable Riches of Christ.</HI> An <HI>Union</HI> with the Lord JESUS CHRIST will invest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Person with a <HI>Portion</HI> that will Supply all <HI>Wants,</HI> Prevent all <HI>Fears:</HI> For, Col. 1.19. <HI>It has pleased the Father, that in Him there should all Fulness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well.</HI> To have <HI>all Fulness</HI> for a <HI>Portion,</HI> is to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Full Portion;</HI> and a <HI>Full Portion</HI> is a <HI>Good</HI> One. Truly, an UNION with the Lord Jesus Christ, is <HI>the pearl of great price.</HI> If ALL will not make a <HI>Good Portion,</HI> what will? But, Col. 3.11. <HI>CHRIST is ALL.</HI> Behold, A <HI>Portion</HI> that furnishes our <HI>Hungry</HI> Souls, with the <HI>Bread of Life;</HI> Our <HI>Naked</HI> Souls' with the <HI>Garments of Salvation;</HI> Our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickly</HI> Soul with <HI>Healing from His Wings!</HI> Mise∣rable Souls that Reject such a Portion! Oh! our dear People; Do it not!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly;</HI> The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST reckon'd <HI>Ours,</HI> is a <HI>Good Portion;</HI> It is most Righteously to be reckon'd so. SIN is the <HI>Worst Evil.</HI> To be Saved from <HI>Sin,</HI> is a <HI>Good Portion.</HI> It was the Exclamation, Psal. 32.1, 2. <HI>Oh! the Blessednessess of the Man! Oh! the Blessednessess of the Man!</HI> There is a <HI>Law of Righteousness,</HI> wherein the Holy God has Condemned us unto dreadful Confusion, upon the least Failure of our Obedience to Him. We have grievously failed in our Obedience, and the Sentence of the Law has doom'd us to suffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. Tis a <HI>Good</HI> thing sure, to be Released from the Sentence of Eternal Death, and at the same time to be Possessed of a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

the Law of God has adjudg'd <HI>Eternal Life</HI> as a Reward. The <HI>Son</HI> of God, Assuming our <HI>Nature</HI> became a <HI>Mediator,</HI> particularly Exercising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Priestly Office,</HI> in the yet more particular capacity of a <HI>Surety,</HI> to answer the <HI>Law of Righteousness</HI> in our stead. This our <HI>Surety,</HI> did both endure the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and fulfil the <HI>Precept</HI> of it, in our stead, according to the <HI>Covenant</HI> between God the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> about His doing so. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST had a most <HI>Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Heart,</HI> and led a most <HI>Righteous Life,</HI> and at length underwent the <HI>Miseries,</HI> that are the <HI>Essentials</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Punishment,</HI> which was due to us for our <HI>Un¦righteousness.</HI> Thus there is a Glorious RIGHTE¦OUSNESS wrought out and brought in, for the chosen People of God.

<P><Q>O my Lord JESUS CHRIST; Hast thou given me a New Heart? An Heart that has thy <HI>Knowledge</HI> Enlightening of it, thy <HI>Image</HI> rectify∣ing of it? An Heart to Love thee, and Prize thee, and Serve thee, and prefer my Interest in thee, and thy Interest in the World, above
<PB REF="001217_0022_0FB13128B1D9D358"/>
every thing in the World! Wonderful <HI>Testimo∣nies</HI> of thy Benignity towards me! <HI>Rejoyce,</HI> O my Soul, <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in these <HI>Testimonies.</HI> They are an <HI>Heritage</HI> for ever to be <HI>Rejoyced</HI> in! And, O my Lord JESUS CHRIST; Has thy Word assured me, that Thou hast prepared an Hea∣venly City for thy chosen People? A <HI>City</HI> wherein I shall enjoy <HI>Durable Riches,</HI> and <HI>Plea∣sures for evermore!</HI> A <HI>City,</HI> wherein I shall be Saved from all that can be grievous to me, and I shall be <HI>fill'd with all the Fulness of God!</HI> I be∣lieve thy <HI>Testimonies! Rejoyce,</HI> O my Soul, <HI>Re∣joyce</HI> in an Everlasting <HI>Heritage,</HI> reserved in the Heavens for thee! And now, what ever I am deprived of, as long as I have CHRIST, and GRACE and HEAVEN left, it is all well enough. I have an <HI>Heritage</HI> always to be <HI>Re∣joyced</HI> in. Though I should be <HI>Afflicted very much,</HI> yet if my <HI>Afflictions,</HI> may forward me in my Advances to this <HI>Heritage,</HI> I may even <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in those <HI>Afflictions,</HI> as in the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of the Di∣vine Favour to me. Let those <HI>be Miserable, that can be Miserable: for my part, I cannot.</HI> O my God, my God, Thou art my <HI>Heritage;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in my <HI>Heritage;</HI> Tis a <HI>Good Portion</HI> and it never shall be <HI>taken away!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Conclude then; Psal. 73.26. <HI>My Flesh and my Heart faileth; but God is the strength of my Heart and my Portion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it must be Remembred, That it was MARY, who has given us the <HI>Pattern,</HI> which we
<PB N="24" REF="001217_0023_0FB1312A13B4A5B0"/>
thus insist upon. Will those of <HI>her Sex</HI> there have the Ingenuity, to Look upon themselves as peculiarly concerned in it; and not only to <HI>Take,</HI> but also to <HI>Give</HI> a <HI>Pattern</HI> of such Devoti∣on! If a <HI>Timothy</HI> were <HI>with all Purity,</HI> to address the Counsils of God unto <HI>that Sex,</HI> Let them now receive this Address, <HI>That they would make choice of</HI> MARIES <HI>Portion.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, They are well Matched, who are <HI>Espoused</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Son of God, the King of Heaven and Earth. Let a <HI>Friend of that Bridegroom,</HI> then come to you with the Language of the Psalmist; <HI>Hearken, O Daugh∣ter, He is thy Lord, and Worship thou Him.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, The rarest <HI>Beauty</HI> under Heaven may not be compared with the <HI>Heavenly Beauty</HI> of a Soul, which has the <HI>Image of God</HI> Renew'd up∣on it. Certainly, There are no <HI>Garments</HI> com∣parable to the <HI>Righteousness of the Saints,</HI> the <HI>Fine Linen</HI> which the <HI>Wife of the Lamb of God</HI> is array'd withal. Certainly, There are no <HI>Jewels</HI> compa∣rable to the <HI>Graces,</HI> which are <HI>Ornaments of great Price</HI> in the sight of God Himself.</P>
<P>All this is in MARIES <HI>Portion;</HI> And your <HI>Preferring</HI> of it, will be your <HI>Securing</HI> of it. Use the Wisdom, to <HI>Chuse</HI> it, <HI>Above all things that you can desire;</HI> and by <HI>Chusing</HI> it you will become the Owners of it. Oh! That the Consideration might <HI>Win</HI> upon you. Do but heartily and sin∣cerely say, <HI>O Lord, Be thou mine! My Soul sayes unto thee, O Lord, None but CHRIST, None but
<PB N="25" REF="001217_0024_0FB1312BAE95ACA8"/>
CHRIST!</HI> From this moment He becomes <HI>Thine,</HI> O MARY, and thou art Happy throughout E∣ternal Ages.</P>
<P>Methinks, You may see some <HI>Encouragement</HI> into this Godliness, in the <HI>Reputation</HI> which God in His Providence most observably bestows upon them, in whom it has been observable. MARY stands upon Record, for <HI>Chusing</HI> the <HI>Good Por∣tion,</HI> and will Shine upon Earth as long as there is a Moon in Heaven.</P>
<P>The Commemoration of them, who have <HI>Walked with God,</HI> until they are <HI>Taken by God,</HI> it may stir the <HI>Envy</HI> in some of the <HI>Living,</HI> but it is a <HI>Kindness,</HI> not so much unto the <HI>Dead,</HI> as unto the <HI>Living.</HI> Let it be Proclamed; A <HI>Good Name</HI> is a <HI>Better Portion</HI> than <HI>Great Riches,</HI> and it is a <HI>Portion</HI> of them that have Chosen the <HI>Best Portion</HI> of all.</P>
<P>Tis Instanced in that Worthy GENTLE∣WOMAN, (One upon every account worthy to be called so,) whose Death is at this Day the Lamentation of them, who reckon the Graves of the Saints, proper places to drop their Tears up∣on. In her Character, all that have any Regard unto Vertue, agree to fulfil that Promise of God; Prov. 31.30. <HI>A Woman that fears the Lord, she shall be Praised.</HI> I must in Justice make this Report, <HI>That I never once in all my life, to my Remembrance, heard one Ill word spoken of her.</HI> We may say of her, as they said of <HI>Ruth, All the People knew, that

She was, when she no longer <HI>shone with his Rayes,</HI> afterwards, and many Years, a <HI>Widow,</HI> which <HI>de∣parted not from the Temple,</HI> but served God in <HI>His House,</HI> with a scarce to be parallel'd Frequency &amp; Industry. In <HI>her own House,</HI> the Lively Concern that she Expressed, for the serving of her God, and the saving of her Soul, gave a lovely Repre∣sentation of <HI>Christianity to the Life;</HI> and she is gone to Reap the Harvest of it, in <HI>Everlasting Life.</HI> Her Name-sake SARAH, is the only Wo∣man, whose <HI>Age</HI> is Recorded in the Sacred Ora∣cles. It minds me to say of our SARAH, That

unto the <HI>Seventy Fifth</HI> Year of her <HI>Age,</HI> did she continue serving of her LORD, and waiting for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</P>

<P>Before the <HI>Palsey</HI> struck her, she had heard that comfortable Advice from Heaven, <HI>Be of Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heer, Thy Sins are forgiven thee.</HI> And she could say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a rare Gentlewoman of the same Spirit with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id; <HI>My Head is in Heaven, my Heart is in Heaven, and it won't be long before I my self come to be in Heaven.</HI> The very Day, that her FRIEND, (for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Faith in the <HI>Death</HI> of her Saviour she had made him so,) I mean, her DEATH. came to call her away, he found her painfully Preparing for him. When some that were very Thoughtful for her, would have disswaded her from ven∣turing abroad unto the Sermon, in so bitter a Season, she made a Reply, which, I wish all the Town would think upon; a Reply to this purpose; <HI>If the Ministers can go abroad to Preach, certainly, it becomes the People to go abroad; and hear them.</HI> The Sermon she then heard, was Excellently well fitted, for her <HI>Funeral Ser∣mon:</HI> Describing the <HI>Righteous</HI> as <HI>more Excellent than their Neighbours,</HI> it not only declared the Sentiments of her own Regenerate Soul, and who they were whom she had from her very
