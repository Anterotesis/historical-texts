<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the writing the following discourse and prayer, the publisher has been greatly solicited, by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</P>
<P>Therefore, in pursuance to the repeated requests that has been made, the publisher hath made use of the press to convey the same to the publick, with hopes it may be useful to some, and that no disadvantage will ensue to any individual.</P>
<P>The publishing of good books hath oftentimes been of great service, nay, hath often been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the lukewarm.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following discourse will be attended with the same power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which caused them to flow forth.</P>
<P><PB REF="011241_0003_0F8678E7F5B2C3E0"/>
It is not the province of the editor to say much, or to multiply words, but hopes the ensuing discourse and prayer may be read with a solid and sober mind.</P>
<P>It is the indispensible duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden vessels (holy words) of the Lord's house, and see that they prophane not the temple of God with unhallowed tongues.</P>
<P>I therefore shall leave the issue to the all-wise disposer of all good things.</P>
<P>The publisher having not seen the author of the follow∣ing discourse, since she delivered it, the publick cannot expect to have her approbation for publishing the same; but he hath shewn it to many that were present at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the substance of what they heard.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI></P>
<P>[These words being much insisted on in the foregoing part of the discourse, the editor hath thought proper to prefix the same.]</P>
<P>IF I mistake not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, both he and his disciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he was graciously pleased to honour with his heavenly presence; and even there manifested himself by his omnipotent and divine power, in a most wonderful and miraculous manner.</P>
<P>Since my sitting down here amongst you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, with∣out the least study or premeditation. I could not be silent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the
<PB REF="011241_0005_0F8678E9459FB280"/>
divine will; for I desired not the sound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apostle and servant of our Lord did, to whom a dispensation of the gospel was committed; who said, <HI>Woe be unto me if I preach not the gospel!</HI> I heartily wish, and it is the earnest desire of my mind, that those that are now concerned, may be solicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of every individual, that is here present, to invite this heavenly guest, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly presence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus solicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great reason to expect his gracious presence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promised, saying, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and bless them. Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name</HI> (that is, my power) <HI>there will I be in the midst of them, and I will bless them.</HI> What wonderful condescension is this to his chil∣dren and people, to be so highly favoured with his heavenly presence!</P>
<P>In this he fulfils his promise which he hath made to his disciples, as he expresses himself in another place, saying, <HI>I and my Father will come and sup with them, and we will make our abode with them.</HI> O! blessed in∣habitant
<PB REF="011241_0006_0F8678EA1D878E18"/>
and heavenly guest! O! that it may be the happy experience of the present parties here concerned, that they may be favoured with the heavenly manifesta∣tion of divine love, that they may witness his stupen∣dous power to visit, preserve, guide and direct them!</P>
<P>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may all be a watching, and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is strength in weak∣ness, and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his heavenly teaching, that is found of them that seek him, as he himself hath graciously promised, who said, <HI>He that seeketh me shall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast off.</HI> Here our blessed Lord shew∣eth his unspeakable love to the sons and daughters of men, to be thus so graciously visited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the solicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxious to hear what may be spoken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and ex∣perience thy divine will. This was the short prayer of my spirit since my sitting down among you. I heartily wish it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we should have cause to
<PB REF="011241_0007_0F8678EB4C1093C8"/>
rejoice in our coming together; and it would do our souls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to seek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us, and in the midst of us; and have the happy experience to witness his power, and taste of his blessing. By this experience we shall come to know his heavenly power to preserve, and his divine instruction to teach us, who speaks as never man spoke, who is the Won∣derful Counsellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everlasting Father, and of the increase of his go∣vernment there shall never be an end.</P>
<P>Now, what great advantage would this be to the chil∣dren of men, to know and witness this great power to rule and reign in them, whose right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and di∣rect us in his ways.</P>
<P>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly instructions, we shall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to
<PB REF="011241_0008_0F8678EB8C178CF0"/>
be done in us as it is done in heaven; and have that ex∣cellent prayer of our Lords answered; <HI>Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done on earth at it is done in heaven.</HI> O! what an excellent and heavenly experience it is to have the mind resigned to the will of our heavenly fa∣ther! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy-Ghost? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what sweet tranquility of mind do they possess, where the kingdom of God is come? where righteousness and peace is known? and where the Lord Jesus rules and reigns?</P>
<P>It was observed before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his presence, they had a watch. The servants that attended, they were to watch and o∣bey the orders given them; which was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon our Lord: by their waiting and watching they came to know the Lord's will, and o∣bey His orders.</P>
<P>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expression to the servants that attended? It was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And we may remember they were ordered to put wa∣ter
<PB REF="011241_0009_0F8678EC670935B8"/>
into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they waited for the divine com∣mand. Here, our Lord shewed his miraculous power. Here it it was our Blessed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the servants that waited, to hand it forth Observe. The water was first made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not before, the servants had to hand it to the company that was present. How gracious was our Lord, how great his power, in shewing forth this miracle? I could hot but admire his great love and wonderful condescen∣sion to mankind!</P>
<P>Now, let us observe the expression in the orders gi∣ven, which was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And he directed the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the feast, that he might taste it; and he tasted it, and those that were at the mar∣riage. What was then expressed? It was, <HI>The last wine is the best.</HI> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and condescension of our dear Lord, in be∣stowing his gifts to his children and people; how he manifested his power amongst them; and how conde∣scending he is to those that are anxious to know the wa∣ter being made wine, that the spirits of the contrite might be revived, and those that are ready to faint might be refreshed by the handing forth of divine love, which
<PB REF="011241_0010_0F8678ECF6733580"/>
is the w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is strength in weakness and riches in poverty. Our own strength, as men and creatures, is as water, be our Education ever so high, and our wisdom but foo∣lishness. It is like water and not wine, be it ever so excellent, till taught of the Lord, by his inspeaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the same that ever it was, that those who are truly concerned, come to know and witness a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly sought after, that all those that are here present, may be solicitous to hear his voice, that speaketh as never man spoke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and heavenly instruction; that they may taste of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his servants to hand it forth to the peo∣ple, may they have it to say (from a true and real ex∣perience, <HI>the last wine is the best.</HI> This has been the concern of my spirit among you, that you may wit∣ness his power to be with you, and in the midst of you. It is his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</P>
<P>I have sometimes thought the lord is wonderfully manifesting his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cause of the water being made wine, not those that hand it forth. If he doth not pre∣pare
<PB REF="011241_0011_0F8678EDB47CFB30"/>
it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not or∣der it to be given, it is but water, and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality can satisfy those that are seeking the Lord for divine help and strength. This has been on my mind as I have been engaged amongst you; and I think it was in some degree as a miracle.</P>
<P>I do not want to monopolize other persons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more willing to hear than to speak; but, methinks, when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine blessing, in order that the guests which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord he prepares it himself. He is inviting his children to come and re∣fresh themselves with the wine of his kingdom. O, if people did but see, if their minds were rightly con∣cerned; and if there was but a true seeking to him, there would be a tasting of the wine of his preparing.</P>
<P>O that the eve of the mind was but single to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the Father is well pleased, who said <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!</HI> It is my sincere desire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his hea∣venly voice, that you may come to be acquainted
<PB REF="011241_0012_0F8678EE73D0F038"/>
with him, and obey his voice, that is the true Minister of the Sanctuary and Bishop of his Church and People, whom God the Father sends, is the earned prayer of my spirit.</P>
<P>Now, if the eye were single to him, and our expec∣tations from him, and not from the arm of flesh; we should know the Lord Jesus, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I say, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet prophesied of, saying <HI>A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up, like unto me. Him shall you bear in all things; and be that doth not bear him, shall be cut off from among his people.</HI> If we did but hear and obey God, we should come to know his power to be amongst us. O that there may be a trusting in the Lord, and a dependance on his Spirit and Power to teach and instruct us, is the ear∣nest concern of my mind. It is He that speaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>As we come to be divested of Self, as there is no leaning on our own understanding [<HI>Lean not to your own understanding, but trust in the Lord</HI> (said an eminent servant of God) <HI>trust in the Lord, and he will help thee</HI>] not to lean on words, nor to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and parts of the creature, be them ever so high and ex∣cellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect
<PB REF="011241_0013_0F8678EF4AB4DC28"/>
resignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord, for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that seek him shall find him: the humble he will teach of his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and those that thirst after righteousness he will fill with his hea∣venly wine.</P>
<P>But, O Friends! there must be a watchfulness and care not to lean on our own understanding, or on our own cogitations, that is so apt to fill the mind. If we come to experience this, O how should we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is Truth and no lie, for he is the God of Truth.</P>
<P>It is the true and humble seeking soul shall be bless∣ed of the Lord, and those that hunger and thirst after righteousness; it is they, and they only, shall obtain the promise, <HI>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</HI> but the rich and the full, they shall be sent empty away. Those that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are those that shall be sent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the strength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all Beings, and Principalities, both in Heaven and Earth.
<PB REF="011241_0014_0F8678EFF1AF9EA8"/>
Blessed be the God of Truth! It is He that teacheth his people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with himself. It is by the manifestation of Christ Jesus the truth is come to be known, as he himself hath ex∣pressed, saying, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given amongst men, but the name of Christ, whereby mankind can be saved.</HI></P>
<P>It is Christ Jesus, which is Life and Truth, that would raise us from sin and death to a life of righteous∣ness. If there was but a seeking to him, and a de∣sire to be taught by him, what advantage should we then receive? Our sorrow should then be turned into joy, and our weakness into strength; we should then come to know the promise of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and strength in all our weakness. All those that do put their trust in him, and have an eye single to him, that are solicitous for his divine instruction, and seek him with all their whole heart, who seeks the doctrine from his mouth, shall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be single to him, thy whole body shall be full of light; that is, if thou art singly looking to God, and to his divine ap∣pearance in thine own heart, thou shalt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be
<PB REF="011241_0015_0F8678F2033F6BC0"/>
known of God, is made manifest in man. (This is scripture doctrine.) It is there he is manifesting and re∣vealing himself against sin and wickedness, and against every evil way.</P>
<P>He that maketh manifest is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If thine eye be single; thy whole body shall be full of light; thou shalt see what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone In him there is no confusion, but the confusion is in the creature, for want of singly looking to God; and this want is the cause of the want of a true devotion to and worshipping God aright, who is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth; for such doth the father seek to worship him. There must be no dependance on flesh and blood; for flesh and blood shall never enter into heaven. The apostle Paul conferred not with flesh and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly vision, to the instruction of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, as himself hath said. <HI>I conferred not</HI> (says he) <HI>with flesh and blood but straightway gave up to the heavenly vision.</HI> He did not receive the gospel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Observe how bold he speaks his own experience, <HI>I conferred not with flesh and blood. I re∣ceived it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Christ Jesus, the heavenly instructor, who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that</HI>
<PB REF="011241_0016_0F8678F31DD7D0F8"/>
<HI>cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was given to the apostle, just men∣tioned, to preach Christ Jesus to the Jews as Well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a stumbling-block and to the Gentiles foolishness. It was by obe∣dience and a resignation to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an excellent instrument, in the hand of God, to discourage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteousness; for it is the Righteous, my Friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a shame to any people. This is instruction to mankind. This is what the Apostle of our Blessed Lord had to distri∣bute. It was the great Business his Master sent him to do, to preach righteousness and discourage immora∣lity, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteous∣ness (which exalteth a nation) be established. This was the End for which Christ came into the world, and was prophesied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to sin and finish transgression, and in the room thereof establish everlast∣ing righteousness.</P>
<P>Now, if ever the work of righteousness is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it must be be∣gun at home, in our own hearts; for (observe) Christ
<PB REF="011241_0017_0F8678F3B267F9F8"/>
came to take away sin, and in the room thereof to es∣tablish everlasting righteousness. We may also take notice of another expression of an eminent servant of Our Blessed Lord, that <HI>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</HI>—(what for?)—<HI>to take away sin, in order that he might redeem to himself a peculiar and holy people, zealous of Good Works.</HI> How can we but be concerned that the Glorious End for which Christ came, might be answered, that sin, which is shame, might be put an end to, and transgression fi∣nished, that righteousness which exalteth a nation be established.</P>
<P>If we were truly sincere, if we were true ministers Jesus Christ, how anxious would we be, how zealous would we labour, that sin might be put an end to, all transgression finished! There is no room left for sin nor place for transgression; but the Lord directs to righ∣teousness, and without holiness no man shall see the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eye than to behold iniquity with approbation. There is no people that are so beloved of the Lord, that he can ap∣prove of sin in them. It is nor forms or modes of re∣ligion, or a formal righteousness, nor the inventions men will do; but it is through obedience and sanctifi∣cation we are made righteous; and by being wash with the water of regeneration we come to be cleansed from sin and pollution.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="011241_0018_0F8678F472CC0740"/>
If we come to be the beloved of the Lord, it must be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his heavenly will. It is the obedient soul shall live. It is he that shall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All those that do his will shall know of his doctrine. It is they that shall be taught of the Lord, as our dear Lord said, <HI>He that do∣eth my will shall know of my doctrine.</HI> O may there be a real concern in every heart, and an earnest desire raised in each of our minds, that sin may be put an end to, and transgression finished! If we were solicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and strength would be put into our minds, that everlasting righteousness might be brought in, and the kingdom of Christ be established.</P>
<P>If we were true Christians, taught of the Lord, and solicitous for his honour, we should be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and willing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his cross, and draw our inclinations to him∣self. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</HI> saith the Scripture of Truth. Here is a beautiful com∣parison. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his cross, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become ser∣viceable in the creation, and useful to one another; for
<PB N="20" REF="011241_0019_0F8678F593610388"/>
he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glo∣rify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind since I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of instruction, which is the way to life, and become o∣bedient to the voice of wisdom, which is calling them in the secret of their hearts. The Lord, in his mercy is calling unto the sons and daughters of men; he is calling them from darkness to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan to serve the Living God. I cannot but admire his unspeakable love and wonderful mercy that he bestows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can shut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can shut and shutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a complying, if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteousness, the door of mercy will be shut. This is plainly set forth in the parable of the virgins.</P>
<P>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came the foolish virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they said unto the wise, <HI>Give us of your oil.</HI> What was the answer of the wise? It was a very reasonable one,—<HI>Not so, lest there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for yourselves. And when they went to buy, the</HI>
<PB REF="011241_0020_0F8678F640D4FB70"/>
<HI>bridgroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was shut;</HI> and an answer was made to the foolish virgins, when they wanted to enter, <HI>I know you not.</HI> A dismal sentence it was, and will be pro∣nounced to the wicked,—<HI>Depart from me. I know you not.</HI> I hope that this may never be the case of any that is here. The foolish had a name to virgins as well as the wise; but that would not get them an entrance. Tho' they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the answer, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Observe. Here was both a name and profession to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the foolish wanted oil: they wanted righ∣teousness. The time was elapsed; the door of mercy was shut; an answer was made; and a woeful sen∣tence pronounced,—<HI>Depart from me. I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard of him that speaketh as never man spoke; who speaketh in the secret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his house upon the sand. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell, because it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with those that trust to a name of religion, and a for∣mal righteousness, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earnestly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy bless you and keep you: may his infinite power preserve and protect you!</P>
<P><PB REF="011241_0021_0F8678F6B5DB9130"/>
But he that built his house on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not, because it was built upon a rock; so will be stand who builds on the divine rock, Christ Jesus, the Son of God, and sure Foundation, Against him the gates of Hell shall never prevail. The floods may come, and the winds may blow, and waves of temptations may raise themselves high, he shall stand in the Day of Trial, because he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</P>
<P>Therefore let none deceive thems∣elves, for <HI>Such aa you sow, such shall you reap.</HI> If you sow to the spirit, you shall of the spirit reap life everlasting; but if you sow to the flesh, a miserable crop shall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteousness wrought in us we come to taste of the blessing; and <HI>O that it may be the case!</HI> is the earnest prayer that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppose I should say it hath attended me here, for which my soul doth bless the Lord, who hath come down to his peo∣ple, and is making his power known in blessing the provision of Zion. We cannot but worship at the throne of his footstool, who is God over all, blessed in him∣self. He only is worthy to be adored, honoured and obeyed, not only now, but now, henceforth and for∣ever more. AMEN.</P>

<P>BE pleased, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemo∣rate thy goodness. We are made to ad∣mire, in a sense of our own nothingness, and say <HI>O Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the sons of men that thou thus visitest them?</HI> Thy children that love thee in their hearts, prevail, un∣der the influence of thy heavenly power, and are made willing to follow thee, and feel after thee, thou Lord God that changest not. Thou art a God, slow to anger, a God of wonderful love and unspeakable kindness, Thy Truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to be∣seech thee, in behalf of mankind, all the world over let their names or profession be what it may) that thou∣sands and tens of thousands may be brought home to thy Son; and that thou wouldst make thyself known, by manifesting thyself to them. Be pleased to remem∣ber, in mercy, those that have much thought of thy name, and also those that have not enquired after thee; that by and through the discovery of thy light, O Lord God of Truth, they may come to see thy sacred truth, and be made to follow thee wheresoever thou goest, that thy name, which is holy, may be glorified.

Prepare many more, yea, many thousands, that they may taste of thy goodness, and hear the voice of the High Priest who speaks as never man spoke. In a sense that thou art a God that changest not, and that it is therefore the sons of men are not consumed: in a sense of thy good∣ness and mercy, we humbly present ourselves before thee, and beseech thee that many may come to know and praise thy great name, who alone is worthy to be praised, adored, and magnified, with thy dear Son im∣maculate, and Holy Spirit for ever more. AMEN.</P>
