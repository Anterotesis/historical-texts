<HEAD>THE QUEEN OF THE MAY.</HEAD>

<L>'TWAS the morning of May, and the yellow hair'd god</L>

<L>And flew to his Delia in haste:</L>
<L>Awake, love, he cry'd, my dear charmer, arise,</L>
<L>And join the gay throng on the geeen;</L>

<L>He ravish'd a kiss, ah! how happy, he cries,</L>
<L>Wou'd my Delia permit me to speak.</L>
<L>Or wou'd she consent to repair to the brow,</L>
<L>Where yon' village steeple is seen,</L>
<L>To be constant and faithful, I'd cheerfully vow,</L>
<L>And make her my heart's chosen Queen.</L>

<L>She cou'd not refuse; yet, asham'd to comply,</L>
<L>Her eyes with soft tenderness shone;</L>
<L>Young Corydon seiz'd the soft moment with joy,</L>

<L>Then with hearts light as air, and as innocence gay,</L>
<L>They join'd the gay throng on the green;</L>

<L>I listed in the war,</L>

<L>I brav'd the hottest of the fight,</L>
<L>As was a soldier's due,</L>
<L>Convinc'd my country's cause was right,</L>
<L>And many a foe I slew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last kind Peace her olive wav'd,</L>
<L>And Dartmouth town I sought,</L>
<L>And many a gem in plunder sav'd,</L>
<L>To Caroline I brought.</L>

<L>But she refus'd my hard-got means,</L>
<L>And deem'd my visit bold;</L>
<L>For love the boast of happier scenes</L>
<L>Was barter'd since for gold.</L>

<HEAD>THE MAID OF MARTINDALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>A favorite Song.—By Mr. HAWKINS.</BYLINE>

<L>IN Martindale, a village gay,</L>
<L>A damsel deigns to dwell,</L>
<L>Whose looks are like a summer's day,</L>
<L>Whose charms no tongue can tell:</L>
<L>Whene'er I meet her on my way</L>
<L>I tell my am'rous tale,</L>
<L>Then heave a sigh, and softly say,</L>
<L>"Sweet Maid of Martindale."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This nymph has numbers in her train,</L>
<L>From Hodge up to the squire;</L>
<L>A conquest makes of ev'ry swain,</L>
<L>All gaze, and all admire:</L>
<L>Then where's the hope, alas! for me,</L>
<L>That I should e'er prevail?</L>
<L>Yet while I breathe I'll think of thee,</L>
<L>Sweet Maid of Martindale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should Fate propitious be my lot,</L>
<L>To call this charmer mine,</L>
<L>I'd live content in lowly cot,</L>
<L>And pompous thoughts resign:</L>
<L>But if she scorns each heartfelt sigh,</L>
<L>And leaves me to bewail;</L>
<L>For thee, my fair, for thee I'll die,</L>
<L>Sweet Maid of Martindale.</L>

<HEAD>THE HONEY-MOON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WOU'D you know, my good friends, what the honey-moon is,</L>
<L>How long in duration, how perfect in bliss,</L>
<L>A proof may be found, and a sample be seen,</L>
<L>In some boarding-school couple just left Gretna∣green.</L>
<L>My dearest, my duck,</L>
<L>My sweetest, my chuck;</L>
<L>Miss Kitty's an Angel, her Billy a God;</L>
<L>Whips crack, glasses jingle,</L>
<L>While sighs intermingle,</L>
<L>And Cupid assents, and goes niddity nod,</L>
<L>Niddity nod, niddity nod,</L>
<L>O'er Kitty the Angel, and Billy the God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Papa's and Mama's surly tempers once past,</L>
<L>Bright Bloomsbury square has this couple at last!</L>
<L>In three weeks possession, how pleasures will cloy!</L>
<L>Neglect hurts the lady, and time cools the boy,</L>
<L>So impatient to roam:—</L>
<L>Ma'am, you're never at home,</L>
<L>A path so vexatious no wife ever trod;</L>
<L>My torment, my curse;—</L>
<L>You are bad. You are worse.</L>
<L>While Cupid flies off, from a quarrel so odd,</L>
<L>Niddity nod, niddity nod,</L>
<L>And Miss is no Angel, and Billy no God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To routs hies the lady, to gambling goes master,</L>
<L>To part from each other ne'er couple went faster.</L>
<L>While raking at night, and distraction at noon,</L>
<L>Soon close all the joys of the sweet honey-moon,</L>
<L>Bleeding hearts, aching heads,</L>
<L>Sep'rate tables and beds,</L>
<L>Render wedlock's sweet countenance dull as a clod,</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="023456_0045_0FBF897CE7F723E0"/>

<L>COME, lasses, and list' to my song,</L>
<L>A good matrimonial receipt,</L>
<L>In choosing you'll never be wrong,</L>
<L>I'll mark you the lover complete;</L>
<L>For, spite of your blushes, I know</L>
<L>A lover is never a-miss;</L>
<L>The lass that's most apt to say no,</L>
<L>Is sometimes inclin'd to say yes.</L>

<L>If fond of a red coat and cockade,</L>
<L>I pray let this hint me enough,</L>
<L>A man that makes fighting his trade,</L>
<L>Thinks he ne'er can have fighting enough.</L>
<L>The coxcomb, all tinsel and shew.</L>
<L>The rake is a stranger to bliss,</L>
<L>Be sure still to answer them no,</L>
<L>However inclin'd to say yes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your wits are more knowing than great,</L>
<L>Avoid all these knowing ones, pray;</L>
<L>Your fools are too fond of their prate,</L>
<L>Tho' in fact they have nothing to say:</L>
<L>But the lad who is honest and kind,</L>
<L>Who in constancy places her bliss;</L>
<L>When he asks if to love you're inclin'd,</L>
<L>Be honest enough to say yes.</L>

<L>Strange things I'll tell, which late befel</L>
<L>In Philadelphia city.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas early day, as poets say,</L>
<L>Just when the sun was rising,</L>
<L>A soldier stood, on log of wood,</L>
<L>And saw a sight surprising.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As in a maze, he stood to gaze,</L>
<L>The truth can't be denied, sir,</L>
<L>He spy'd a score—of kegs or more,</L>

<L>These KEGS now hold the rebels bold.</L>
<L>Pack'd up like pickled herring:</L>
<L>And they're come down t'attack the town,</L>
<L>In this new way of ferrying.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The soldier slew, the sailor too,</L>
<L>And scar'd almost to death, sir,</L>
<L>Wore out their shoes, to spread the news,</L>
<L>And ran till out of breath, sir,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now up and down, throughout the town,</L>
<L>Most frantic scenes were acted;</L>
<L>And some ran here, and some ran there,</L>
