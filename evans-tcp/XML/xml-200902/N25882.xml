<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>28th. 7th. month, 1708.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY ancient love, if you can believe it, reaches to you, as in times past, and years, that are gone, even, in the divine root and prin∣ciple of love and life, that made us near to one another, above all worldly considerations; where our life, I hope, is hid with Christ, in God, our Father; so that, when he appears, we shall also appear with him, in glory; and in the meantime, through us, to those that love and wait for his appearance, as the desire of nations; that we may glorify God, his and our everlasting Father, in our bodies, souls and spirits, in tempo∣ral and eternal affairs; being indeed none of our own; forasmuch as we are our own, we are none of the Lord's; a great mystery, but a great truth, and of absolute necessity to witness, to be of the number of the chosen nation, the peculiar people, and royal priesthood of Christ, and his glorious kingdom.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear friends, let all below this keep on the left hand; and wait to feel those blessed things, to inherit right hand; and in faith and courage, cry aloud to the Lord, for his renewing and refreshing power, that may revive and reform his work upon your hearts and minds; and our humility, meekness, patience, self-denial and charity, with a blame∣less walking, may plainly appear, and manifest the work of God upon our hearts, to those that are without; which is not only the way to bring up the loiterers, and gather in the careless ones, to their duty, but fetch home and bring in, the strangers, and the very enemies of the blessed truth, to confess and acknowledge that God is in you, and for you, of a truth.</P>
<P>Now, my dear friends, as to outward things, I have sent a new Go∣vernor, of years and experience; of a quiet, easy temper; that, I hope, will give offence to none; nor too easily put up any, if offered him, with∣out hope of amendment. The Queen very graciously approved of him, at first offer, and gave him her hand to kiss; and, at last, being intro∣duced by the Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> she added, <HI>"Sir, I wish you a good journey, and shall be ready to serve you."</HI> He is sober, understands to command and obey, moderate in his temper, and of what they call a good family: his grandfather, Sir <HI>Vincent Gookin,</HI> having been an early great planter in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> the first, and the first Charles's days; and he intends, if not ill treated, to lay his bones, as well as substance among you; having taken leave of the war, and both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to live amongst you; and as he is not voluptuous, so, I hope, he will be an example of thriftiness. In short, he has instructions, as much to the virtue, justice and peace of the country, as I can express myself, or you desire, for your comfortable living; pray, therefore, receive him kindly, and express it, by a modest subsistence; or, rather, give it me, to give him, or, how you please.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Lovelace,</HI> Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> and a promising one indeed, presses, and the Admiral's orders, for sailing, are gone down; the wind fair, and Governor <HI>Gookin</HI> leaves me to-morrow.</P>
<P>I earnestly beseech you to assist <HI>James Logan,</HI> and who else the Trustees, for the payment of the money here advanced, shall nominate, not only to get in, but turn into money, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> best you are able, that I may come honourable to you, and speedily; which I hope to do, as soon as you, and these friends here, think fit. Let me have this pledge of your love, and it shall be a lasting one, to advise and assist you for the expediting the matter; for be assured, I long to be with you; and, if the Lord bring me and mine well there, I hope not to return on almost any terms, at least not without your advice and satisfaction; for care of you, and settling plantations for my poor minors; for planters, God willing, they shall be, in their father's country, rather than great merchants, in their native land; and to visit friends throughout the continent, at least, their chiefest business.</P>
<P>In the first love I leave you and yours, and all the Lord's people amongst you; my family and affairs, to the merciful providence and or∣derings of our great and gracious God, that welcomed us, in poor <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> with his excellent love and presence, and will, I hope, once more, and remain your loving and faithful friend,</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Address</HI> of the Representatives of the free∣men of the province of Pennsylvania,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assembly's ad∣dress to Go∣vernor Gookin.</NOTE> in assem∣bly met, the 9th. day of the month called March, 1708-9, presented to <HI>Charles Gookin</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by the Queen's royal approbation, Lieu∣tenant Governor of the said province, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING this opportunity, we can do no less than congratulate thy seasonable accession to this government, and render our most grateful acknow∣ledgments to the Queen, for her gracious accep∣tance of the Proprietary's nomination of thee, to supply his absence, and to him, for constituting a person of so fair a character, furnished, as we hope, with a full resolution, as well as power, to
<PB N="6" REF="034421_0006_0FFD9EC9751AD558"/>
redress the grievances, and remove the oppressions, that this poor province has, for some time, labour∣ed under, occasioned by the irregular administra∣tion of the late Deputy Governor; who was too much influenced by <HI>evil counsel;</HI> to which the mi∣series and confusion of the state, and divisions in the government, are principally owing.</P>
<P>We are ready to represent such of those public grievances, as are laid before us, or occur to our knowledge, in particular articles, and bring them to a proper examen; but, perceiving by thy message to the house yesterday, that thou art not ready, at this time, to proceed with us to business, we shall take leave only to mention some of those things, of which the public weal of this country loudly calls for a most earnest application and speedy re∣dress.</P>
<P>In the first place, we are to lay before thee, that of the <HI>false alarm</HI> in May, 1706; wherein the late Governor was chief actor; and for which he is highly chargeable; having shot at the Queen's subjects, putting many of the inhabitants of this town in danger of their lives, and forced great quantities of powder and lead from the owners, and gave it to such as wasted it, when he knew there was no occasion to use it; whereby he deprived the place of what ammunition might be ready for those, that had freedom to make use of it, for their defence, in case of an attack.</P>
<P>The next is that notorious act of hostility, he committed by firing shot at the Queen's subjects passing by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the river, upon their law∣ful trade, to and from this port.</P>
<P>We mention these, as they are, in our opi∣nion, offences of a deep dye, and committed against the Queen's crown and dignity, as well as against the peace, and ought to be charged upon
<PB N="7" REF="034421_0007_0FFD9EB81A5A9500"/>
him, before he departs this province; but the method of the prosecution against him we submit to thy prudent care and discretion, and we shall be ready to do what is proper on our parts.</P>
<P>That the Treasurer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. S. Carpenter.</NOTE> of the last tax has refus∣ed to comply with the directions of the Assembly, in paying the public debts, according to the re∣spective orders drawn upon him, and signed by the Speaker; and that the Collectors of the said tax, who neglected their duty, in gathering the same, have not been obliged thereunto, according as the act of Assembly, in that case, directs, and more particularly the Collector of the city and county of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>That the courts of judicature of this pro∣vince have been, and are, erected by ordinances of the Governor and Council, against the advice, and without the assent of the Assembly; which we <HI>complain</HI> of, as a <HI>great oppression</HI> and aggriev∣ance to the people, we represent, and desire the same may be speedily redressed, and the bill pre∣pared for the establishing courts, with other useful bills, ready to be presented to the Governor, may be considered.</P>
<P>We are given to understand that thou brought some commands from the Queen to this government, as well as instructions from the Pro∣prietary, relating to the public, which, with a copy of thy commission, and the royal approba∣tion, we desire may be communicated to this house, at our next meeting, which we intend on the twentieth day of the next month, and shall adjourn accordingly, unless it be thy pleasure to call us sooner; which we shall be ready to comply with, not only in expectation of a speedy redress of our grievances, but to settle by law, how mo∣ney

<P>Thus, by the Assembly's very first address to Governor <HI>Gookin,</HI> were the former animosities continued; for the principal and ruling members of the house were still the same, who had so long been accustomed to complain of grievances, if not to exaggerate, or imagine some things of that kind; insomuch, that, though they had sufficient reason to complain of part of Evans's conduct, in proper time and place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly shew more of temper than prudence, &amp;c.</NOTE> yet their manner of mentioning some things under the name of <HI>oppression</HI> and <HI>griev∣ance,</HI> and in demanding, or urging, for others, such a mode of satisfaction, as the nature of their case rendered impossible to obtain in the province, par∣ticularly those respecting <HI>Evans</HI> and his admini∣stration; which, perhaps, would have been more prudently dropped, with the removal of their cause, seemed to shew more their temper of mind, than prudence: but <HI>Evans</HI>'s ill or imprudent conduct had made such deep impression on their minds, and disposed them so much to a discontented and angry disposition, that in some of their represen∣tations▪ they appear not only to have exaggerated
<PB N="9" REF="034421_0009_0FFD9E22E7869B48"/>
what might truly be called grievances, but also complained of some things as such, which, in reality, and according to the laws and constitution, could not properly come under that name.</P>
<P>The Governor's reply to the Assembly's address is contained in his first speech to the house, on the 13th of the next month, April, as follows, viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It would have proved a much greater satis∣faction to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor's an∣swer to the Assembly's address.</NOTE> if at this first time of my speaking to you, I had nothing to take notice of, but what I myself might have to lay before you; but your address, presented to me in March last, when you sent me notice that you were sitting, will, before we proceed to any other business, require some answer; in which I will be plain and short, as the matter will bear.</P>
<P>I thank you, gentlemen, for your congra∣tulations, and do assure you, that I come with full resolutions, on my part, to employ the power, with which the Proprietary has thought fit to ho∣nour me, and her Majesty has graciously pleased to approve of, to render the people of this government as happy and easy as is possible for me, in all things, that shall concern their true interest, and be to their real advantage. I have enquired what might be meant by those <HI>aggriev∣ances, oppressions</HI> and <HI>confusions,</HI> which you complain of, and whatsoever I shall meet with, that deserves those names, shall have my ready concurrence to remove them, as far as they shall appear; but must say, that, I believe, one effectual method to free all people from the apprehensions of griev∣ances, will be, to lay all former animosities and jea∣lousies aside, and, for the future, apply themselves to such business as they are concerned in, for the public, with a freedom and openness of temper, and an unbiassed inclination to promote the com∣mon
<PB N="10" REF="034421_0010_0FFD9E5873466B48"/>
good, without any other particular view: if we should be so fortunate as to take example from her Majesty's glorious administration of her domi∣nions at home, and that of her parliament, we should not fail of being extremely happy.</P>
<P>As to those two past actions of my immediate predecessor, of which you complain, I can only inform you, that they were both well known in <HI>Britain,</HI> before I left it; and that I had no di∣rections to make any enquiry into them; and that, upon the best advice I can receive here, I find they will not properly fall under my cogni∣zance, in the station I am placed in, and therefore cannot think it fit to concern myself with them.</P>
<P>But I am obliged to observe to you that the Council of the province, now with me, think themselves very unjustly treated by the mention you have made of them, if they (as it is generally understood) be intended by the <HI>evil counsel,</HI> of which you have taken notice; and therefore, will take the liberty to vindicate themselves, as you will see, by their application to me; to which I refer you.</P>
<P>The charge against the Treasurer,* I find, is occasioned by his and the Council's understand∣ing the act of Assembly, by which the money, that comes into his hands, has been granted, somewhat differently from what the <HI>present and late Houses</HI> of Representatives have done: he pleads the law, as his best direction; and you cannot but agree, that it is fit that this alone (I mean the law) ought to determine the matter. As far as I have hitherto been able, I have pressed the collection of the taxes, and shall continue the best of my care, until they be finished.</P>
<P>The method of establishing courts, by the Governor and Council, was also well understood
<PB N="11" REF="034421_0011_0FFD9E4466E79458"/>
in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and was approved of there, as being grounded on unquestionable powers, grant∣ed the Proprietary. The bill formerly proposed by the Assembly, for that purpose, which is now before the board, has not been allowed of; but seeing the present establishment, which was drawn, as I am informed, according to the plan laid down in that bill, carries some inconveniencies with it, and requires an alteration, I shall be ready to agree to any other reasonable bill, that you shall hereafter propose, for settling courts of judi∣cature, in such a regular method, as may be a lasting rule for holding them.</P>
<P>I have no instructions, gentlemen, from her Majesty, that will concern you; those from the Proprietary being to myself, as occasion offers, and where it may be proper, I shall acquaint you with the particulars. I have ordered copies of my commission, and her Majesty's approbation, to be prepared and delivered to you.</P>
<P>I should now propose to your serious consi∣deration some other matters of the highest import∣ance, without which government cannot long sub∣sist; as a due provision for the support of it, and for the security of the people; but what I shall principally recommend to you, at this time, is the latter part of the last paragraph of your address, <HI>viz.</HI> To prepare a bill for settling by law, how money shall be paid, upon contracts made, and to be made, before the new currency of money takes effect: This, as I find, by the great uneasi∣ness of the people, is a matter that will require a very speedy provision, and, therefore, hope you will find such just and equal methods for it, as neither the debtors, on the one hand, nor credit∣ors, on the other, may suffer by the alteration; to which I desire you may forthwith proceed, with as little loss of time as is possible; after which we
<PB N="12" REF="034421_0012_0FFD79FDF6AFE4A8"/>
may have opportunity to enter into consideration of such other matters, as may naturally fall before you.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly reply to the Govern∣or, &amp;c.</NOTE>The Governor's speech produced an answer from the Assembly, on the 14th; in which, be∣sides insisting on what they had before advanced, they distinguished what they meant, in their ad∣dress, when they said, <HI>"The late Governor was too much influenced by evil counsel,"</HI> by expressly throwing the whole blame on <HI>James Logan,</HI> and some other persons, who were not of the Govern∣or's council. They moreover promised to make due provision for the support of government; and agreed to consider and prepare the bill, which the Governor recommended, as a very necessary part of their business; and then they hoped and expect∣ed a redress of their grievances.</P>
<P>The following is the Council's address to the Governor, in reference to the <HI>evil counsel,</HI> men∣tioned in the address of the Assembly, and replied to in the Governor's speech, but, in order of time, it precedes the Assembly's answer, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣cil's address to the Go∣vernor.</NOTE>To the honourable <HI>Charles Gookin,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieu∣tenant Governor of the province of <HI>Pennsylva∣nia,</HI> and counties of <HI>Newcastle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> on <HI>Delaware.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the members of Council for the said province, who attended the board, during the ad∣ministration of the late Lieutenant Governor, up∣on viewing the address presented by the Assembly on the 9th day of March last, think ourselves obliged to observe, that, in the first paragraph of it, complaining of <HI>aggrievances</HI> and <HI>oppressions,</HI> which, they say, this province has, for some time, laboured under, occasioned by the irregular admi∣nistration of the late Deputy Governor, they have
<PB N="13" REF="034421_0013_0FFD9EBCF5B84608"/>
thought fit to add these words, <HI>who was too much influenced by evil counsel;</HI> to whom the miseries and confusions of the state, and divisions in the government, are principally owing.</P>
<P>It was long, may it please the Governor, before we could induce ourselves to believe, that men, so well acquainted with the characters of most of us, in our several stations, in the country, could possibly intend us by the charge, until, by the observations of others, we were forced to take a nearer notice of the expressions; upon which we are sorry to find, that the word <HI>counsel,</HI> as there used, together with the general construction of the sentence, seems not to admit of any other interpretation, but that to us principally is owing whatever the Assembly has thought fit to complain of, or, can reduce, under the general terms they have used: if they will disavow any such intention, we shall crave no other satisfaction; but, if not, we must then desire, that they, and all men con∣cerned in these affairs, may know,</P>
<P>That, notwithstanding the Proprietary and late Lieutenant Governor, according to the established rules in all governments whatsoever, from the most polite, to the most barbarous, nations in the world, finding themselves under a necessity of hav∣ing a Council about them, to advise with, in affairs of government, have thought fit to choose us for that service, in which, according to our several solemn engagements, we have acquitted our∣selves, to the best of our judgments and abilities, yet not one of us receives, or ever expects, any other advantage by it, than the satisfaction of having discharged our duties to the country we live in, and to advance the prosperity and happiness of it, as much as may lie in our power. We have no salaries, nor allowance, paid us by the country for this, nor offices of profit, to encourage us;
<PB N="14" REF="034421_0014_0FFD7A0038799888"/>
what we do is at our own expense of time, trou∣ble and charge, and upon our own estates is all our dependance, which, giving us as good an in∣terest in the country, as others can pretend to, and being out of the reach of any possible views different from the good of the whole, no man, without a manifest violence to his reason, can ima∣gine but that we are as much concerned, and, therefore, would be as careful to prevent and divert any <HI>miseries, confusions, or divisions,</HI> that may threat∣en the province, as any other sett of men what∣soever; so that this charge, from the Assembly, if levelled against us, is not only unjust, but will be judged, we believe, exceedingly ungrateful, by all that impartially consider us, and our circum∣stances, among our neighbours.</P>
<P>After this general accusation, involving us in all things, that have been irregularly commit∣ted, or, that any person can think so to have been, they enumerate four particulars, which they call <HI>aggrievances.</HI> To the two first we have nothing to say; and we hope no man can believe, that any one of us was so much as privy to them, much less that we <HI>advised</HI> them; we here solemnly declare, each for himself, that we did not. The other two we acknowledge ourselves to be con∣cerned in, and shall always justify: that is, first, That we advised the Treasurer to take his directi∣ons from the law alone, and without regard to the partial order of the assembly to the contrary, to make his payments in equal portions; which, we hope, cannot be accounted a <HI>grievance:</HI> and in the next, To prevent the greatest of all possible <HI>grievances,</HI> the want of public justice, of which, by the measures taken by the Assembly of that time, the country was long deprived; we advised the Governor to make use of the powers, with which he was unquestionably vested, to open the courts again, and to restore the courts of justice to the

Men unacquainted with affairs of this kind, and who must take their information from others, may be imposed on by persons of design, and believe that to be irregular, which, in itself, is a most wholesome and necessary act; but we can, with assurance, affirm, that we had full satisfaction, from men of the best abilities, that what we advised and concurred in this matter, was regular, just and legal.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, may it please the Governor, though on the one hand, we shall be exceedingly unwilling to have any misunderstanding with the representatives of the people, well knowing it to be an unhappiness, that all reasonable measures should be taken to prevent; yet, on the other, we shall not, by any contrivances, be diverted from discharging the trust reposed in us, during our continuance, in this station, with honour and justice, to the best of our abilities; but, from time to time, shall offer to the Governor such ad∣vice as we shall judge most conducive to the gene∣ral good of the province; in the welfare of which we are so nearly concerned, in our several private interests; and in the meantime, hope we may justly expect to be secured from calumny and misrepre∣sentation.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Governor having laid this representation of the Council before the Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly displeas∣ed with the Council, &amp;c.</NOTE> it produced an address to him, by way of answer, from the House. In this they blamed the Council, for seeming to apply to themselves, in general, what was meant by the words, <HI>evil counsel;</HI> of which, they said, they had given their explanation before, in their answer to the Governor's speech.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Council's address is dated prior to the Assembly's answer to the Governor's speech, &amp;c.</NOTE> They were displeased at the Council's declaring, they had nothing to say, respecting the two particulars of <HI>Evans</HI>'s conduct, mentioned in the Assembly's address, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the <HI>false alarm,</HI> in 1706, and the <HI>affair at Newcastle.</HI> As to the other two points, in regard to the Council's advising the Treasurer and the Governor, as they acknow∣ledged themselves to have done; the Assembly appeared incensed at the Council's presuming to do the former, as it was not properly their office; and they censured them for opposing the late As∣sembly, in their advice to the Governor, on the bill of courts, and their assenting, at the same time, to the Governor's ordinance, for carrying into execution the same thing, and so nearly in the same manner, that the said bill was intended to do; in short, they were angry that the Coun∣cil should present (in their words, <HI>patronize</HI>) such an address, so opposite to the views and drift of the House, and declared, they considered it, as an indignity offered to them, as well as to the late Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034421_0017_0FFD7A09AF63B2D8"/>After this was laid before the Governor, the Assembly presented a remonstrance, complaining of divers particulars, in the province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly present a remon∣strance of grievances, &amp;c.</NOTE> which they stiled <HI>grievances,</HI> and requesting his concurrence to remove and redress the same: some of which seem to have been either trifling, mistaken, or aggravated, and to shew more the temper of the House, than real grievances; the rest have already been mostly mentioned.</P>
<P>The resentment of <HI>David Lloyd,</HI> the Speaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enmity between Lloyd and Logan too much the cause of these pro∣ceedings, &amp;c.</NOTE> against <HI>James Logan,</HI> and the too ready devotion of the House to his humour, are represented to have had too much place, in some of these trans∣actions. It is scarcely to be doubted that there was real occasion, in some cases, to complain of grievances, which demanded proper attention and relief; but the word <HI>grievance,</HI> was become com∣mon, and so often used, that its proper applica∣tion seems not always to have been sufficiently at∣tended to; for it is certain, that by too much in∣dulging a disposition and habit of complaint, it has sometimes remarkably affected the imagina∣tions of men, and magnified, in appearance, what was but small, in reality; and there have been in∣stances, wherein it has so far prevailed as to induce the mind entirely to mistake one thing for another, and to create a firm belief of the absolute exist∣ence of what, in truth, had no being.</P>
<P>There are but few things, for which an apology may not be made, and plausible reasons given;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apology for the As∣sembly's conduct.</NOTE> and it may reasonably be alledged that the views and intentions of some of these Assemblies, in thus carrying their disagreement with the Execu∣tive, in some cases, to such extreme, were good; and consequently mistake, or excess, in their con∣duct, might be the more excusable; for it is not to be denied that some good effects to the province, in reality, resulted from these proceedings. Be
<PB N="18" REF="034421_0018_0FFD9EBE7A94F2C0"/>
that as it may, it ought likewise to be remembered, that no wrong action can justify the intention;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Though not to be justified in everything, &amp;c.</NOTE> nor can any profitable consequence alter the nature of an unwarrantable design; and however lauda∣ble, or just, the general views of some of these Assemblies may be alledged to have been, who carried affairs to such extremity, yet it sufficiently appears, that under the allegation of <HI>grievances,</HI> some of them too much gratified their animosity; and that, in part of these controversies, at least, they cannot, in every thing, be fully justified, notwithstanding certain good consequences may from them have arisen to the province; which is no certain proof that they might not have been the cause, or means, of preventing greater advan∣tages from arising to it, besides too much endan∣gering those, which they already enjoyed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They did not suffici∣ently consi∣der the ten∣dency of such dis∣putes, &amp;c.</NOTE>But whatever were their real motives, they seem not to have duly considered the end, to which the nature of such continued discontents might finally tend, and the consequence of rendering the government more uneasy and disagreeable to the Proprietary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. antea.</NOTE> than was really and absolutely necessary: for the disposal of it to the crown, to which, as before hinted, he had such strong and various inducements, at a time, when measures were in agitation for reducing all the Proprietary governments to regal ones, would soon have freed him from all his difficulties, respecting the govern∣ment of the province, and would have effectually enabled him to discharge all his debts and incum∣brances, principally occasioned on its account; from which, so far as appears, he had too much reason to complain, as he did, of his small, inad∣equate and discouraging returns; besides the na∣ture of these disagreements, and continued en∣deavours to diminish his power and interest in it, as appeared in the proposed bill of courts, and the attempts of the Assembly to turn his <HI>quit-rents</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="034421_0019_0FFD7A2FF4121FB8"/>
to the support of his Deputy,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Assembly, in their address to Governor <HI>Evans,</HI> in 6 mo. 1708, says,</P><P>"We know, that when the province was granted to the Proprietary, he had power, at his pleasure to convey any part, or parts thereof; and to erect manors, and to reserve such rents, customs and services, as he should think fit; in pursuance whereof, he sold lands to a great value, and reserved rents, sufficient, in a moderate way, to <HI>maintain him,</HI> or <HI>his Lieutenant,</HI> answerable to their station," &amp;c.</P><P>And afterwards, in their reply to the Governor's answer to the above, &amp;c. (part of which see in the notes before, &amp;c.) they again say,</P><P>"Where is the extravagance of what we mentioned on this head? Is it, because we said, That the rents reserved are sufficient, in a mode∣rate way, to <HI>maintain the Proprietary</HI> or <HI>his Lieutenant,</HI> answerable to their station? We see no cause to decline saying so still: and what, if we add, That we desire the Proprietary would be content to live upon his rents; and that fines, forfeitures, escheats, and other profits and perqui∣sites of government should be employed for the common good, and pub∣lic service of the government, it would not be without precedent?" &amp;c.</P><P>"We are not willing to suppose, when the Proprietary was favoured with the royal charter, and by virtue thereof assumed the government of this province, and entitled himself to royal mines, escheats, fines, forfeitures, and other profits (which, in their nature, are the rights of the crown, and, as such, ought to be employed for the common good) that he intended <HI>to deck himself,</HI> or <HI>his Deputy, with these Jewels,</HI> and not have directed them, and other supplies, given for the support of govern∣ment, to be employed for the good of the public, as revenues of that nature ought to be, but we rather conclude, the contrary."</P><BIBL>[Votes of Assembly, vol. ii.]</BIBL></NOTE> were further and great inducements for him to endeavour to dimi∣nish his difficulty and trouble on its account;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. postea.</NOTE> more especially when it was in his power, in such an easy and effectual manner, to accomplish it; to which it also appears, by his private letters, yet extant in his own hand writing, he was sometimes so much disposed, that had he not studied what he was persuaded was the particular interest and real good of the province, before his own preca∣rious gain, and present quiet, he would, before this time, have put the same in execution: for it was most probable, and he appears to have been fully of opinion, that the inhabitants of the pro∣vince could not have been advantaged, or better∣ed, by such a change of government, in those times, but the contrary; provided they rightly understood their present privileges, and knew
<PB N="20" REF="034421_0020_0FFD7A3390791E08"/>
how to make a proper use of them; for otherwise liberty and privilege become pernicious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, they had more liberties and privileges, or means of render∣ing themselves happy, under the Proprietary, by a prudent and proper use of them, than could reasonably be expected, immediately under the crown; but, on the contrary, too great a mis-use of these, either by contention, or otherwise, might possibly render the regal government, or greater restraint, more beneficial, or better and happier, for a people to disposed; for the effects of privilege and liberty, in any case or situa∣tion, can only be happy or beneficial from a proper use of them.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The wisest councils sometimes err, &amp;c.</NOTE>But absolute, or unlimited, perfection is not to be expected in human nature; and if the wisest councils of men sometimes err, how much more may a young Assembly of honest, or well mean∣ing, colonists be reasonably supposed liable to mis∣take their own real interest, under the most plau∣sible views of any, in thus contending for what they thought the rights and privileges of the people? who, in a legislative capacity, had not yet arrived at that maturity of judgment, and prudence of action, which length of time and experience alone can give?</P>
<P>After having presented their remonstrance, the House adjourned; and at their next meeting, on the first day of the fourth month, the Governor made them the following speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor's speech to the Assem∣bly.</NOTE>The Queen, for the good of her subjects of the provinces, has fitted out an expedition, with great expense, for the retaking of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and for the conquest of <HI>Canada,</HI> and has entrusted Colonel <HI>Vetch</HI> with her Majesty's letters to the re∣spective Governors, and instructions to agree on proper measures, for putting her Majesty's designs in execution. <HI>Boston, Rhode Island</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> have outdone her Majesty's expectations; and I hope we shall not be wanting in our duty.</P>
<P>The quota for this province is one hundred and fifty men, besides officers, to be victualled and paid, as those of the other governments; the
<PB N="21" REF="034421_0021_0FFD9E84E73212A8"/>
charge, I suppose, will amount to about four thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may seem difficult to raise that number of men, in a country where most of the inhabitants are obliged, by their principles, not to make use of arms; but, if you will raise, for the support of government, the sum demanded, I do not doubt getting the number of men, whose principles allow the use of them, and Commis∣sioners may be appointed for disposal of the coun∣try's money; that the people may be satisfied, that the money is applied to no other use, than this expedition.</P>
<P>I must recommend to you the present cir∣cumstances of the three lower counties; you are not now <HI>falsely alarmed; Newcastle</HI> seems the only place, proper to make any defence; I find them ready and willing to do any thing, in their power, for the good of the country, and look on them∣selves as a frontier to you, though a weak one; and if they perish, in all probability, your destruction will not be far off; therefore, in my opinion, it is your interest, that they be furnished with all things necessary to oppose the enemy.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that, as all private af∣fairs ought to be postponed to her Majesty's imme∣diate service, so it will not consist with my duty to hearken to any proposals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter into any business with you, till he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y's commands be complied with; and, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ore, desire you will give this affair all possible dispatch.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1709.</NOTE>IT cannot be supposed, but that the nature of this requisition must have created a difficulty with a people, who, by their religious persuasion, were not permitted to bear arms, nor to be actively, or immediately, concerned in promoting <HI>military affairs;</HI> and such, at this time, were the inhabi∣tants of the province, in general. It may likewise
<PB N="23" REF="034421_0023_0FFD9EC1F0E72E28"/>
be here observed, that it does not appear reasona∣ble why this principle of the <HI>Quakers</HI> against war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua∣kers princi∣ples against war not to be so much blamed as they are by some, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the evil consequences arising from it, when duly considered, should be an objection, so very material, as some persons make it, against any class or description, of people, in the general community, whose profitable industry, and benefi∣cent conduct, in all other respects, render them of so much the greater utility, and real benefit to the public and common good, even, in this, and every other department; and that more especially in these latter, more improved, or refined ages of the world, since war is become more a trade, or study of a certain class of men only, and more restricted to, and managed by, a part of the ge∣neral community, appropriated to that purpose, than it was formerly, in the more barbarous state of mankind, when every one went to war, capa∣ble of bearing arms, while now it is experienced that the far greater part of the people, in all the most civilized states, are better, or more prefera∣bly employed, in promoting and procuring the necessary support of the whole community, at large: it would be a very great impropriety, to blame any one member of the human body, which is confined, or appointed to one particular office, for not performing that of another; for which it is neither qualified, nor intended, by the Author of human nature: the body politic con∣sists of many parts, or members, as well as the human; and their offices, in a well regulated state, are as various:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are more con∣sistent with humanity, than the contrary &amp;c</NOTE> wisdom is no less requisite than strength; and the arts of peace, with the labours of the industrious colonist, are, at least, as necessary as those of war; which would soon make but a very sorry figure, in any nation, with∣out those means, which are the effects of the for∣mer. Can any thinking and reflecting mind be so unacquainted with the excellency of those quali∣ties,
<PB N="24" REF="034421_0024_0FFD9DF66659E2E8"/>
which distinguish the rational from the irra∣tional creation, as not to be sensible, that it is better by wisdom, or good policy, to prevent war, than by force of arms, and the art military to support, or only to suspend it? For it is impossi∣ble, that the application of a thing, by which, in reality, that same thing solely exists, and is kept alive, should put an end to it, or entirely take away its existence. War is certainly the greatest punishment in the world, that the Almighty hath assigned for the wickedness of the human race; and it is the departure of mankind from their true interest, and real good alone, which makes it neces∣sary; consequently, as a principle of thinking and acting gains ground, or increases, in the world, which approaches nearest to the standard of truth, and takes away the cause of punishment, in the same proportion, must the necessity and practice of this evil decrease in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Absurd ob∣jections against the Quakers of Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE>But, of all people those appear to have the least reason to make this objection a subject of com∣plant against the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> who, knowing their principle, in this respect, never∣theless, in preference to all the rest of the colonies, and, even, to all the rest of the world, which were before them, equally free for their choice, have removed from various distant parts, and settled among them; yet many such have been known in this province! But, which is still more remarkable, that people professedly of a different way of thinking, in this particular, should, in greater numbers, and much more abundantly, flock into <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> from abroad, than into any other of the colonies besides; and yet this has been the real case here, both in later years, and also in the more early times of the province: which certainly shewed a very distinguishing pre∣ference, which, in reality, was thereby given to the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their principles, notwithstanding
<PB N="25" REF="034421_0025_0FFD9E471036B220"/>
the high absurdity, which any of those people, who have thus made <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> their choice, may since have exhibited, by declaiming against them on this account: for it cannot be reasonably supposed they were ignorant that this country, and the government of it, could not possibly have been granted, at first, to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> on account of their <HI>fighting principles,</HI> or that they should <HI>de∣fend it with arms,</HI> by any who properly knew them, notwithstanding they were empowered, or entrusted, so to do, if they chose it; but, on the contrary, for those other qualifications, at least, not less necessary and beneficial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intention of the grant and govern∣ment of Pennsylva∣nia, &amp;c.</NOTE> for the support and real happiness of any country, of which the King and government, at that time, were fully sensible the <HI>Quakers</HI> were possessed; because, in a nation, where sufficient numbers of fighting men are not wanting, on occasion, and may, at any time, be had for money, to defend all parts of its dominions, and where no man, by the laws, is compelled to fight, who pays his equivalent to the support of the government, there would be no absolute necessity, neither was it intended, in the grant of the province, and of the powers of go∣verning it, under the crown, to take these peace∣able people from that proper attention, which was due to the department, in which they were placed, for the general good, in their civil capacity; nor, on that account, to oppress any one part of the com∣munity, for the sake of the other's advantage, unequally.</P>
<P>This appears to have been the principal end and design of the <HI>British</HI> government, at first, respect∣ing this province, notwithstanding those demands of a <HI>military nature,</HI> which, either from a mistaken notion of thereby more effectually serving the public utility, or from other views, different from the real nature and original design of the first set∣tlement and constitution of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> have
<PB N="26" REF="034421_0026_0FFD9DF8D06E8EE8"/>
since been made from it; not sufficiently adverting to the natural, advantageous, and more excellent consequences, which absolutely, and of necessity must always ultimately arise from the principle, practice, industry, and virtue of such a people, to the general community, in proportion to the small number of those, who hold this principle, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> do;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Quakers ne∣ver likely to be very great, &amp;c.</NOTE> a number, which, in all pro∣bability, if we may judge of the future by the past, from the nature and effect of such a princi∣ple, as held by them, whether viewed in a favour∣able, or unfavourable light, will never be very large.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Consistent with the nature and principle of this favour, or indul∣gence to the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in great measure, and with the same design, was that afterwards granted by the <HI>British</HI> government to the <HI>Moravians;</HI> who have since removed into, and settled in the pro∣vince, &amp;c. By the stat. 22.

<P>The Assembly having considered the Governor's speech, divers of the Members consulted a num∣ber of their principal constituents, and Members of Council, being <HI>Quakers,</HI> on the occasion;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Members of Council, consulted on this occasion, being all <HI>Quakers,</HI> and of the principal men in the province, were, Edward Ship∣pen, Samuel Carpenter, Joseph Growdon, Caleb Pusey, Samuel Preston, Isaac Norris, and James Logan, &amp;c.</NOTE> which the House mentioned, in their address, or answer to the Governor; in which they declared,</P>
<P>"That were it not, that the raising of money to hire men to fight (or kill one another) was matter of conscience to them, and against their religious principles, they should not be wanting, according to their abilities, to contribute to those designs." They expressed their regard and loyal∣ty to the Queen, and their prayer for the long continuance of her reign, and concluded, "That, though they could not, for <HI>conscience sake,</HI> comply with the furnishing a supply for such a defence, as
<PB N="27" REF="034421_0027_0FFD9E5BD1F872D8"/>
the Governor proposed, yet, in point of gratitude to the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly vote a present to the Queen,</NOTE> for her great and many favours to them, they had resolved to raise a present of <HI>five hundred pounds,"</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By this mode of business they appear to have made, or intended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For the ge∣neral sup∣port of the govern∣ment.</NOTE> a distinction between grant∣ing supplies for the support of government, in general, or, for its mixt purposes and uses collec∣tively, and that of contributing for the military alone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Being not answerable for the ap∣plication &amp;c</NOTE> besides their not being answerable for the application particularly, or for the duty of the executive part of the government: whereby it may be supposed, they thought they acted consci∣entiously, according to their religious principles, in contributing their proportion of what is abso∣lutely due to the general support of government, or supreme authority, according to the practice of the primitive Christians: the benefit and protec∣tion of which they e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed in common with others, and as they were not actively concerned either in directing or executing that authority; which was out of their line of duty; though this their mode ultimately answered equally the Go∣vernor's request, or intention.</P>
<P>To this they added, in their address, "That they humbly hoped he would be pleased to accept this, as a testimony of their unfeigned loyalty, and thankful acknowledgment, for her grace and clemency towards them, and the rest of her subjects; and though the meanness of the present were such as was unworthy of the favour of her acceptance (which indeed, said they, was caused not through want of good-will, and loyal affection, but by inabilty and poverty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly plead poverty, &amp;c.</NOTE> occasioned by great losses, late taxes misapplied,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Assembly, in their reply to the Governor's answer to this ad∣dress, express, in the following words, what they meant by <HI>misapplication of taxes, viz.</HI></P><P>"And to explain what we mean by <HI>misapplying of taxes,</HI> we must acquaint thee, that about three years ago, a tax was laid on this pro∣vince of <HI>two pence half penny</HI> per pound, and an impost and excise, upon some goods imported and retailed, which was appropriated to certain uses, <HI>viz, eight hundred pounds,</HI> with half the impost, to the support of government; this the late Lieutenant Governor received, with other perquisites, which ought to be applied to the support of government, as the late Assembly signified to him, in August last, whereunto we refer; the money, so appropriated, has <HI>notwithstanding the express words of the act,</HI> been kept, or <HI>misapplied</HI> by him; and he refused to give the last As∣sembly any account thereof," &amp;c,</P></NOTE> lowness of the

<P>"They, therefore, humbly entreated the Go∣vernor to put a candid construction upon their pro∣ceedings, and represent them favourably to their gracious sovereign, the Queen; to whom they trusted they should ever approve themselves (though poor) her most loyal and dutiful subjects," &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor not content with the sum offered &amp;c.</NOTE>The Governor was dissatisfied with this answer, principally on account of the smallness of the sum; and, in reply, represented the urgent necessity of their further exerting themselves, on the occasion. But the Assembly pleaded their poverty and inabi∣lity, and adhered to their resolve of presenting the Queen with £. 500, requesting the Governor duly to consider the nature of such a refusal, and of his interposing between them and their Sovereign, in such a case.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He urges them to give a larg∣er sum, &amp;c.</NOTE>The Governor again, in his turn, pressed their compliance to a more generous contribution, de∣claring, his present conduct, in the affair, to be his indispensible duty, in consequence of the Queen's letter; and of the utmost importance to them, to

secure her favour, and disappoint those, who de∣sired a dissolution of the present government.</P>
<P>After this several messages and answers passed between the Governor and Assembly, on the sub∣ject, but without any effect; for the House, being determined to adhere to their resolve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They ad∣here to their resolve.</NOTE> concluded it to be their opinion, that, as the Governor had refused to give his assent to their proposal of raising the £. 500, above mentioned, and to proceed to other business, till it was now too late, in the sea∣son, to sit longer, at present, they would there∣fore adjourn, till the harvest was over.</P>
<P>Of this the Governor, being informed, by a written message from the House, it produced fur∣ther altercation, or dispute between them; the Governor being determined to proceed to no other business, till that of the Queen was first issued; and the House declaring, they would not agree to the Governor's proposal of raising money, either directly, or indirectly, for the expedition to <HI>Ca∣nada,</HI> for the reasons they had given; yet they continued their resolution of raising £. 500, as a present to the Queen, and intended to prepare a bill for that purpose, at their next meeting, on the 15th day of August next;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly adjourn.</NOTE> to which time they adjourned.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="034421_0030_0FFD9DFB35E30F28"/>
and the easy terms of maintaining it, were sufficiently evident;"—"That, of the mo∣ney, which had been appropriated for that use, now nothing remained, for a present to them; and that, though money could not so sud∣denly be raised, as the case required, yet they might find means to procure credit, so as that they might not go away empty."—"That there was no manner of provision for the Governor's support; That the Proprietary, on whom the As∣sembly had too often had expectation, in the case, had, by his late hard treatment, from some, whom he had too far trusted, been entirely disa∣bled (were it in itself reasonable) to continue any such provision; consequently their immediate re∣solution was absolutely necessary to contribute what was proper in this point; otherwise they must expect a change that would prove more chargeable."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the Assembly's answer, &amp;c.</NOTE>The Assembly expressed their concern for what had happened at <HI>Lewistown;</HI> and that the Go∣vernor was already acquainted how far the gene∣rality of the people of the province could oppose such an attempt. They admired, that, after such large sums, raised for the support of government, they were notwithstanding left so unprovided, as the Governor had represented; and they earnestly requested his assistance, to call the late Governor and Secretary to account, for the money, which, they said, should have been applied to the use of the public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They agree to augment the sum voted be∣fore, &amp;c.</NOTE> To the £. 500, which they had al∣ready voted, they agreed to add £. 300 more, for the other necessary expenses, besides £. 200, to∣wards the Governor's support. They intimated their expectation of his concurrence to redress their grievances, and recommended to his consi∣deration a number of bills, prepared by former Assemblies, and agreed to by the present; of
<PB N="31" REF="034421_0031_0FFD9E29505945B0"/>
which one was for establishing courts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These bills were about eleven or twelve, in number; their titles were, 1. For establishing courts of judicature, in the province. 2. For regulating and establishing fees. 3. For confirming patents and grants, and to prevent law suits. 4. For empowering religious societies, towns, &amp;c. to buy, hold and dispose of land, &amp;c. 5. Of privilege to a freeman. 6. To oblige witnesses to give evidence, and to prevent false swearing. 7.

<P>The Governor, in reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purport of the Govern¦or's reply.</NOTE> acknowledged he was made sensible, that many inhabitants of the pro∣vince could not, in any case, bear arms, so he did not propose it to them, but only a necessary supply in money, without engaging any man against his religious persuasion. That, in regard to what they had said respecting <HI>Colonel Evans</HI> and the <HI>Secretary,</HI> he could not well understand it; the former having affirmed, he received only what was directly allow∣ed by the Assembly, for his own support, and thought himself not at all accountable for it; and that the Secretary seemed to admire what should induce the House to name him, upon that occasion; there being none of it payable to him, but for his own services as an officer. That he thanked them, for taking his support into their consideration, hoping future provision of that kind would be made more easy; and that he would readily agree to any thing, consistent with his duty, and the trust reposed in him.</P>
<P>That, respecting the bills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor can∣not agree to any bill against the Proprietors power or interest, &amp;c.</NOTE> the Proprietary was not at all against establishing courts by law, yet his instructions would not permit him to agree to those points, in the bill, which broke in, either upon his powers in government, or his just inte∣rest;
<PB N="32" REF="034421_0032_0FFD9E4985D33DD0"/>
why such a bill should interfere with these, he could not see; but as he was willing to agree to a bill, for the ease and security of the people, in that respect, properly regulated, and, on his part, to do his duty, so he hoped they would be careful to offer him nothing that he could not as∣sent to, without a violation of his honour and trust, &amp;c. he recommended their reviewing the bills, passed by the former Assemblies; and thanked them for the provision, which they had made for the <HI>Indians:</HI> which concluded the sessions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly persist in their former de∣mands.</NOTE>The Assembly, at their next sitting, in August, notwithstanding the Governor's recommending them to conduct their proceedings so far conform∣able to the powers, he had to oblige them, that their labours might not be in vain, and his point∣ing out to them the exceptionable parts of the bill of courts, &amp;c. still remained tenacious of their own method, and adhered to their former claims. Upon which, at their next meeting, on the 28th of September, he sent them a written mes∣sage, which concludes with the following para∣graph.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of a message from the Governor.</NOTE>"But now, gentlemen, I must be so plain as to tell you, that, though I have been very desirous to see all these matters brought to a ripeness, that they might actually be passed into laws, yet, until I see the country as ready to discharge their duty, in providing for my support, in the administra∣tion, independent of any supply from the Propri∣etary, who, as I told you before, cannot now (were it even reasonable) spare any part of his estate here, to that purpose, I shall account myself very unjust to the duty I owe myself, if I concur in any other public act, in legislation, though truly inclinable to do all, for the advantage of the public, that can reasonably be expected from me: but a Governor cannot lie under a greater obligation to the people, than they do to him; nor can that be
<PB N="33" REF="034421_0033_0FFD9DFCBA87D748"/>
accounted a free gift from them, which is but their indispensible duty; for, at this time, there is no support for a Governor, in this government, but what must be granted by an act of an Assem∣bly. You have told me, that you had voted <HI>five hundred pounds</HI> to the Queen, <HI>three hundred pounds</HI> for the service of the public, and <HI>two hundred pounds</HI> to me; and you have lately informed me, that when I had passed the other acts, the Speaker would present a bill to me, for raising that mo∣ney. It is possible when the others were passed, the Speaker might do so; but, can it, in reason, be expected, that, while you shew so unprecedented and unusual diffidence, on your side, that you would not so much as let me see the bill, but in private, nor allow, that it should, upon any terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly allow not their bill to be communi∣cated to the Council, &amp;c.</NOTE> be communicated to the Council, with whom I am to advise, (though you cannot but be sensible, that, should I design it, yet it is not in my power to pass a bill into a law, until the Speaker has sign∣ed it) which is usually done at the time of passing it. Could it be expected, I say, that I should pass all that you desired of me, and then depend on your presenting that bill? Or, can it be thought reasonable, or, for the security of the public, that I should pass an act, for raising and applying <HI>eight hundred pounds,</HI> for several uses, besides those <HI>two hundred pounds,</HI> said to be grant∣ed to me, without taking proper advice upon it, of those, whom the discharge of my duty, as well as my inclinations, obliges me to consult, in all public matters; nor that I should have it in my power to object to, or alter, any part of the whole bill, after it is presented? No, gentlemen, as I have no designs, but what are plain and ho∣nest, so I must expect a suitable treatment; and, therefore, I now desire you faithfully to lay before the people, whom you represent, and to whom you are returning, what I have here said to you;
<PB N="34" REF="034421_0034_0FFD9DFE440D4AE0"/>
and, upon this occasion, assure them from me, that unless they take care to grant a requisite support, and in such a manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor re∣fuses fur∣ther to act, unless he is supported, &amp;c.</NOTE> as is fit to be accepted, I shall not at all think myself concerned to attend the affairs of the public, in legislation; and what measures the Proprietary will find himself obliged to take at home, I have formerly sufficiently hint∣ed to you; but as I shall not be wanting, on my side, to concur in any thing, that is reasonable, so I hope, the next time I meet the representatives of the people, we shall have such confidence in each other, and they will so far consider their duty, and take such methods, for effecting busi∣ness, that all things necessary may be concluded to our mutual satisfaction, for the true advantage and benefit of this province."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor re∣strained from pas∣sing any bill without consent of the Coun∣cil, &amp;c.</NOTE>By this plain declaration of the Governor, the Assembly easily perceived, to their great mortifi∣cation, that, by reason of the Proprietary's in∣structions, the Governor could not pass any bill, without the advice, or approbation of his Coun∣cil; which, how reasonable soever it might ap∣pear, in itself, was deemed to have no foundation in the royal charter; by which the whole power of legislation was understood to be vested in the Governor, and the representatives of the people. This the House observed in their remonstrance to the Governor, the next day, declaring, that had they known he was so restricted, they would nei∣ther have given him, nor themselves, so much trouble, as they had done: they likewise com∣plained of some other matters, that were not redres∣sed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their greatest re∣sentment against James Lo∣gan, &amp;c.</NOTE> but their greatest resentment appears, in this remonstrance, to be against the Secretary, <HI>James Logan;</HI> against whom is exhibited, in a very an∣gry manner, a long complaint; representing him as the grand obstacle of their proceedings; and, that, though they had endeavoured to reduce him within proper bounds, yet, by reason of his great
<PB N="35" REF="034421_0035_0FFD9EC374FFEAB8"/>
influence with the Governor and Proprietary, he was now advanced above their power, obstructed all their public transactions, that did not please him, treated the Members of the House with in∣sult and abuse, and, in effect, was the chief cause of their grievances and calamities.</P>
<P>In October next following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The old Assembly mostly re-chosen.</NOTE> the same Members of Assembly were mostly re-elected, and <HI>David Lloyd</HI> again chosen Speaker: to whom the Governor, in his speech, on the 17th, after having mentioned divers other affairs, before the former Assembly, unfinished, and further pressed their making due provision for the support of the lieutenancy of the government, a duty, which, he said, was so in∣cumbent upon them, that without it, no govern∣ment could have a being; he thus expressed him∣self:</P>
<P>"Gentlemen, you are met for no other end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the Governor's speech to the Assem∣bly.</NOTE> than to serve the country, whom you represent; I hope, therefore, you will study all possible means, that may contribute to the real happiness of that: which, I believe, you will find, may be much promoted by improving a good understand∣ing between you and me, in our respective sta∣tions.</P>
<P>"I would not willingly look back upon some of the proceedings of the last House, only from thence I must give you a necessary caution, to dwell less, than has been done, on that general language of <HI>evil counsel,</HI> or counsellors, generally used, as an artful method, to strike at the <HI>counsel∣led;</HI> but, with me, I believe, without occasion; or, that of <HI>grievances</HI> and <HI>oppressions,</HI> words, by God's blessing, understood by few, (I find) in this pro∣vince, who form them not in their own <HI>imagina∣tions;</HI> for I assure you, gentlemen, if we are not as happy as the circumstances of the place will admit, it lies much in your power to make us so;
<PB N="36" REF="034421_0036_0FFD9E8EC6DE31A8"/>
of which I hope you will consider, and use your endeavours accordingly, with a full resolution to remove whatever may stand in the way.</P>
<P>"I have already said, that I would not look back to the proceedings of the last House; but the Secretary has found himself so much aggriev∣ed by their remonstrance, that he has presented, for my perusal, a long defence; in which I shall not think myself any further concerned, than to observe to you, that, to my surprise, he has charged the Speaker of that House with some proceedings, which, if true, will require your consideration, and some further measures to be taken upon them; for which reason, I have or∣dered him to lay a copy of them before you; and I must say, if that representation be well grounded, I cannot see that, under this govern∣ment, such a person can be accounted fit for that station; but, at present, I shall no further enquire into it, only recommend to you, to proceed with diligence, in whatever is incumbent on you, in your stations, as well in this, as in all other mat∣ters, that may concern the welfare of the public, and honor of this government, as now established."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly give an answer the next day.</NOTE>This the Assembly answered the next day; tel∣ling the Governor, that, among other things, they also had under consideration the making pro∣vision for his support; and, after having made some angry reflections against the Secretary, whom they considered, in great measure, as the cause of the misunderstanding between them and the Go∣vernor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of their an∣swer.</NOTE> they said:—"But, may it please the Governor, we beg leave to observe, that the duty incumbent on us, to contribute to this general support of the lieutenancy, is grounded upon a condition precedent; so that the people, accord∣ing to the fundamental rules of the <HI>English</HI> go∣vernment,
<PB N="37" REF="034421_0037_0FFD9EA391FC1C58"/>
are not obliged to contribute to the support of that administration, which affords them no redress, when their rights are violated, their liberties infringed, and their representative body affronted and abused: hence it is, that that branch of the legislative authority seldom move to give supplies till their aggrievances are redressed, and reparation made, for the <HI>indignities</HI> they meet with from the other branch of the same authority.</P>
<P>"We are very sensible that the end of our meeting is to serve the country; and we assure the Governor, there shall be nothing wanting, on our parts, to promote it, and improve a good un∣derstanding between him and us, in our respective stations: but let not the language of the repre∣sentatives of the people, about <HI>evil counsellors, grievances</HI> and <HI>oppressions,</HI> be irksome to the Go∣vernor; for we shall not answer the true end of our meeting, nor discharge our duty and trust to those, that sent us, if we be silent, and not insist up∣on redressing those things, that are amiss, with a resolution to use our endeavours to remove what appears to stand in the way.</P>
<P>"We have, with all the application, this short time could allow, informed ourselves of the pro∣ceedings of the late Assemblies, and find no just grounds for the Governor to suppose that their complaints of <HI>evil counsel</HI> or <HI>counsellors</HI> have been used as methods to strike at him; but, we be∣lieve, it was their care, as we find it to be ours, that the Governor may not be imposed on, or prevailed with, to adhere to <HI>evil counsel,</HI> and ren∣der his actings inconsistent.</P>
<P>"We suppose it needless to be more express, than the late Assembly have been, to demonstrate what an enemy the Secretary has been to the wel∣fare of this province; and how abusive he has
<PB N="38" REF="034421_0038_0FFD9EA94FFFFA50"/>
been to the representatives of the people; so that we can do no less than repeat the request of for∣mer Assemblies, to have him removed from the Governor's Council; which we doubt not will be a most effectual means to improve a good under∣standing between thee and us.</P>
<P>"If the Governor will look back, and duly consider the complaints and remonstrances of the late Assemblies, it will appear, that <HI>grievances</HI> and <HI>oppressions</HI> are words, which are formed upon just complaints; and for which the country wants re∣dress; so that what the Governor supposes, on that head, is not candid towards the representatives of the people.</P>
<P>"May it please the Governor, whatever might be the occasion, or design, of the last clause, in thy speech, we are of opinion, it was not well timed; for if the Secretary's charge, against our Speaker, had any weight, it should have been propounded as an objection against the Assembly's choice of him, for Speaker: but, after thou hadst declared thy approbation of their choice, that thou shouldst be prevailed upon so far to patronize the Secretary's insinuation against the Speaker, as to make it a part of thy speech to us, before we had seen, or heard, the charge, we can do no less than resent it, as an <HI>indignity</HI> offered to this House; for, though we are men, that cannot be much meaner in the Governor's eye, than we are in our own esteem, yet we must put him in mind, that, since the royal charter commits this part of the legislative authority to our care, we ought to have the regard, due to our stations."</P>
<P>After this the Governor went to <HI>Newcastle;</HI> and in the mean time the Assembly adjourned. On their meeting again, about the beginning of No∣vember, the Secretary, <HI>James Logan,</HI> intending
<PB N="39" REF="034421_0039_0FFD9ED0C3ACF2D0"/>
for <HI>England,</HI> presented to them a petition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This petition was as follow:</P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the House of Representatives of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The petition of <HI>James Logan,</HI> Secretary of the said province, in most humble manner sheweth,</HEAD>
<P>THAT, whereas the Assembly of this province, chosen the first day of October, 1706, thought fit (as is well known to you) in the month of February, in the same year, to exhibit to the then Lieutenant Governor, certain articles of impeachment against me; copies of which have been industriously diffused abroad; and, since that time, other complaints have also been presented; and upon the presumption, that those accusations might be true, divers applications have been made, by the last Assembly, to the present Lieutenant Governor, requesting that I might be removed from his Council, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet, so it is, may it please the House, that not one of these arti∣cles, or complaints, have ever, to this day, been duly heard, or, at any time, so proved, or, even, rendered intelligible, as that, according to justice, I might have the opportunity of answering them, or speaking in my own justification, notwithstanding I had, by several repeated in∣stances, earnestly pressed to obtain that favour; by which means, and the endeavours, that divers persons, highly disaffected to me, have used to calumniate me, among the inhabitants of the province, I have been most grievously injured and oppressed; now, inasmuch as, for some months past, it has been generally known, that I am speedily to under∣take a voyage for <HI>Great Britain,</HI> whither the Proprietor's affairs do, at present, urgently call me; and being, by the late Assembly's most bitter remonstrance against me, laid under a greater necessity than ever, to clear myself of the several unjust imputations, that have been thrown on me, lest any person, in those distant places, to which I am to repair, and to which the Assembly's papers have been solicitously transmitted, should be so far imposed on, as to believe that those accusations, without any trial, have really some weight in them; which, upon a trial, notwithstanding, I have no cause to doubt, but will totally disappear: I, therefore, hum∣bly beseech this House, that, for rendering me the relief, that is due to the great wrongs, I have sustained, they would be graciously pleased to order all those, who have appeared against me, the severest and most implacable, of my enemies, whoever they be, to proceed in prosecuting me, with their utmost zeal and ardour; that the very worst of my fail∣ings, in public affairs, may be drawn in the most legible characters, and exposed without mercy, to the eyes of all men; to the end that, in be∣holding them, they may fully know the extent of my crimes; and there∣upon regard me, as I shall be found to deserve, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>But, because the time of my departure now draws nigh, I must, therefore, further beseech the House, that this prosecution may be car∣ried on, within such a convenient time, as is consistent with the shortness of my intended stay; and, particularly, that it may not extend beyond the twelfth of this instant; that being the utmost (as far as I can at pre∣sent judge) that I shall be able to attend it; and, I hope, will prove a sufficient time, to dispatch all that is necessary to such a trial; within the compass of which space, I have been well assured, the Governor will be ready, on his part, to hear whatever shall be alledged against me, and as far as in him lies, give such judgment thereupon, as to justice shall be∣long. And I do further earnestly request the House, that they will be pleased to order, that, as speedily as may be, I may have full copies of all the petitions, that have been exhibited against me, to any of the past Assemblies, and that I may be favoured with an opportunity of com∣paring them with the originals: For your special favour in all which,</P>

and be attended with approbation and contradic∣tion, according to their believed importance, and the various mediums, through which they are seen: this province appears to have been never entirely without a discontented and murmuring party in it, from the beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party in the province in early time, &amp;c.</NOTE> or, at least, from very early times; who thought it their duty and interest con∣stantly to oppose the Proprietary, in all cases indis∣criminately, where either his power, or interest, was concerned; and though frequently but small and weak, yet they were sufficiently able to em∣barrass the public proceedings, and endanger the general tranquillity, according as time and oppor∣tunity offered: these, for a number of years past, having, by continual complaints of great and nu∣merous grievances unredressed, worked up the minds of many well-disposed persons, in the pro∣vince, into the belief of the reality of more of this kind than ever existed in it, thereby occasion∣ed hard thoughts of the Proprietary, and some∣what of an unworthy treatment, even, from some of his friends; insomuch, that, for a considera∣ble time, they had obtained a majority in the As∣sembly, and visibly acted in the extreme against him.</P>
<P>The increase of this opposition seems principal∣ly to have arisen from the Proprietary's absence, his not seeing with his own eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party in∣creased by the Propri∣etor's ab∣sence, &amp;c.</NOTE> and trusting his affairs too much to deputies; to which the nature and necessity of his situation and circumstances, in these times, particularly obliged him; as fully appears by many of his private letters, during the latter part of his life, largely expressing his ardent and longing desire to live and die in this country; consequently some things, in his province, were not in that order, which could have been desired, though far from being as they were represented; which, in such a new, young and unexperienced

government, in a colony composed of such an heterogeneous mixture of people of different hu∣mours, opinions and interests, and in a land of so great liberty, as this then was, so much the more required the presence of an able and constant hand, to manage and redress; though, in the whole, compared with others, it was manifestly in a very happy, thriving and flourishing condition.</P>
<P>From hence, however, his adversaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And endan∣gers the go∣vernment and consti∣tution, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the discontented party, took occasion to magnify what was amiss; and, as it is an easy matter to persuade people that they are aggrieved, more especially when under such a variety of difficulties as is common and natural, at least in some degree, to any new settlement of this kind, they, therefore, influenced many of the <HI>well-meaning</HI> to join in the opposition; which was now carried on with a high hand; though, it is, with great reason, ap∣prehended, divers of these neither designed, nor saw, the consequence, to which their proceedings naturally and ultimately tended; which, at length, about this time, produced the following severe and expostulatory letter from the Proprietary to the Assembly, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE>29th 4th mo. 1710.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My old Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is a mournful consideration, and the cause of deep affliction to me, that I am forced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietor's letter to the Assembly in 1710.</NOTE> by the oppressions and disappointments, which have fal∣len to my share in this life, to speak to the people of that province, in a language, I once hoped, I should never have occasion to use. But the many troubles and oppositions, that I have met with from thence, oblige me, in plainness and free∣dom, to expostulate with you, concerning the causes of them.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="034421_0046_0FFD9E9D12067C98"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">1710.</NOTE>When it pleased God to open a way for me to settle that colony, I had reason to expect a so∣lid comfort from the services, done to many hun∣dreds of people; and it was no small satisfaction to me, that I have not been disappointed in seeing them prosper, and growing up to a flourishing country, blessed with liberty, ease and plenty, beyond what many of themselves could expect; and wanting nothing to make themselves happy, but what, with a right temper of mind, and pru∣dent conduct, they might give themselves. But, alas! as to my part, instead of reaping the like advantages, some of the greatest of my troubles have arose from thence; the many combats, I have engaged in; the great pains, and incredi∣ble expense, for your welfare and ease, to the de∣cay of my former estate; of which (however some there would represent it) I too sensibly feel the effects; with the undeserved opposition, I have met with from thence, sink me into sorrow; that, if not supported by a superior hand, might have overwhelmed me long ago. And I cannot but think it hard measure, that, while that has proved a land of freedom and flourishing, it should become to me, by whose means it was principally made a country, the cause of grief, trouble and poverty.</P>
<P>For this reason I must desire you all, even, of all professions and degrees, for although all have not been engaged in the measures, that have been taken, yet every man, who has an interest there, is, or must be, concerned in them, by their effects; I must, therefore, I say, desire you all, in a serious and true weightiness of mind, to consider what you are, or have been, doing; why matters must be carried on with these divisions and contentions, and what real causes have been given, on my side, for that opposition to me, and my interest, which I have met with; as if I were
<PB N="47" REF="034421_0047_0FFD9E9F81DF4B38"/>
an enemy, and not a friend, after all I have done and spent, both here and there: I am sure, I know not of any cause whatsoever. Were I sen∣sible you really wanted any thing of me, in the relation between us, that would make you hap∣pier, I should readily grant it, if any reasonable man would say it were fit for you to demand; provided you would also take such measures as were fit for me to join with.</P>
<P>Before any one family had transported them∣selves thither, I earnestly endeavoured to form such a model of government, as might make all, concerned in it, easy; which, nevertheless, was subject to be altered, as there should be occasion. Soon after we got over, that model appeared, in some parts of it, to be very inconvenient, if not impracticable; the numbers of members, both in the Council and Assembly, were much too large; some other matters also proved inconsistent with the King's charter to me; so that, according to the power reserved for an alteration, there was a necessity to make one, in which, if the lower counties were brought in, it was well known, at that time, to be on a view of advantage to the province itself, as well as to the people of those counties, and to the general satisfaction of those concerned, without the least apprehension of any irregularity in the method.</P>
<P>Upon this they had another charter passed, <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> which I always desired might be continued, while you yourselves would keep up to it, and put it in practice; and many there know much it was against my will, that, upon my last going over, it was vacated. But after this was laid aside (which indeed was begun by yourselves, in Colonel <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s time) I, accord∣ing to my engagement, left another, with all the privileges, that were found convenient for your
<PB N="48" REF="034421_0048_0FFD9EA60100CA48"/>
good government; and, if any part of it has been, in any case, infringed, it was never by my approbation. I desired it might be enjoyed fully. But though privileges ought to be tenderly pre∣served, they should not, on the other hand, be asserted, under that name, to a licentiousness: the design of government is to preserve good or∣der; which may be equally broke in upon by the turbulent endeavours of the people, as well as the overstraining of power, in a Governor. I de∣signed the people should be secured of an annual fixed election and Assembly; and that they should have the same privileges in it, that any other As∣sembly has, in the Queen's dominions; among all which this is one constant rule, as in the par∣liament here, that they should sit on their own adjournments; but to strain this expression to a power, to meet, at all times during the year, without the Governor's concurrence, would be to distort government, to break the due propor∣tion of the parts of it, to establish confusion in the place of necessary order, and make the legislative the executive part of government. Yet, for ob∣taining this power, I perceive, much time and money has been spent, and great struggles have been made, not only for this, but some other things, that cannot, at all, be for the advantage of the people to be possessed of; particularly the appointing of Judges; because the administration might, by such means, be so clogged, that it would be difficult, if possible, under our cir∣cumstances, at some times, to support it. As for my own part, as I desire nothing more than the tranquillity and prosperity of the province and government, in all its branches, could I see that any of these things, that have been contended for, would certainly promote these ends, it would be a matter of indifference to me how they were settled. But seeing the frame of every government ought
<PB N="49" REF="034421_0049_0FFD9E2BC68D0080"/>
to be regular in itself, well proportioned and sub∣ordinate, in its parts, and every branch of it in∣vested with sufficient power to discharge its respec∣tive duty, for the support of the whole, I have cause to believe that nothing could be more de∣structive to it, than to take so much of the pro∣vision, and executive part of the government out of the Governor's hands, and lodge it in an un∣certain collective body; and more especially since our government is dependent, and I am answerable to the crown, if the administration should fail, and a stop be put to the course of justice. On these considerations I cannot think it prudent, in the people, to crave these powers; because not only I, but they themselves, would be in danger of suffering by it; could I believe otherwise, I should not be against granting any thing of this kind, that were asked of me, with any degree of common prudence and civility. But, instead of finding cause to believe, the contentions, that have been raised about these matters, have pro∣ceeded only from mistakes of judgment, with an earnest desire, notwithstanding, at the bottom, to serve the public (which, I hope, has still been the inducement of several concerned in them) I have had but too sorrowful a view and sight to complain of the manner, in which I have been treated. The attacks on my reputation, the ma∣ny indignities put upon me, in papers sent over hither, into the hands of those who could not be expected to make the most discreet and charitable use of them; the secret insinuations against <HI>my justice,</HI> besides the attempt, made upon my estate; resolves past in the Assemblies, for turning my <HI>quit-rents,</HI> never sold by me, to the support of government; my lands entered upon, without any regular method; my manors invaded, (under pre∣tence I had not duly surveyed them) and both these by persons principally concerned in these attempts
<PB N="50" REF="034421_0050_0FFD9E4BEDFB5CC0"/>
against me here; a right to my overplus land, unjustly claimed by the possessors of the tracts, in which they are found; my private estate con∣tinually exhausting, for the support of that go∣vernment, both here and there; and no provision made for it by that country; to all which I cannot but add, the violence, that has been particularly shewn to my Secretary; of which (though I shall, by no means, protect him in any thing, he can be justly charged with, but suffer him to stand or fall by his own actions) I cannot but thus far take notice, that, from all these charges, I have seen, or heard of, against him, I have cause to believe, that had he been as much in opposition to me, as he has been understood to stand for me, he might have met with a milder treatment from his prose∣cutors; and, to think that any man should be the more exposed there, on my account, and, instead of finding favour, meet with enmity, for his be∣ing engaged in my service, is a melancholy con∣sideration! In short, when I reflect on all these heads, of which I have so much cause to complain, and, at the same time, think of the hardships I, and my suffering family, have been reduced to, in no small measure, owing to my endeavours for, and disappointments from, that province, I can∣not but mourn the unhappiness of my portion, dealt to me from those, of whom I had reason to expect much better and different things; nor can I but lament the unhappiness, that too many of them are bringing on themselves, who, instead of pursuing the amicable ways of peace, love and unity, which, at first, hoped to find in that re∣tirement, are cherishing a spirit of contention and opposition; and, blind to their own interest, are oversetting that foundation, on which your hap∣piness might be built.</P>
<P>Friends, the eyes of many are upon you; the people of many notions of <HI>Europe</HI> look on that
<PB N="51" REF="034421_0051_0FFD9E0409630F98"/>
country, as a land of ease and quiet, wishing to themselves, in vain, the same blessings, they con∣ceive you may enjoy: but, to see the use you make of them, is no less the cause of surprise to others, while such bitter complaints and reflections are seen to come from you, of which it is difficult to con∣ceive, even, the sense or meaning. Where are the <HI>distresses, grievances,</HI> and <HI>oppressions,</HI> that the papers, sent from thence, so often say, you lan∣guish under! while others have cause to believe, you have hitherto lived, or might live, the hap∣piest of any, in the Queen's dominions?</P>
<P>Is it such a <HI>grievous oppression,</HI> that the <HI>courts</HI> are established by my power, founded on the king's charter, without a law of your making, when upon the same plan you propose? If this disturb any, take the advice of other able lawyers on the main, without tying me up to the opinion of prin∣cipally one man, whom I cannot think so very proper to direct in my affairs (for, I believe, the late Assembly have had but that one lawyer amongst them) and I am freely content you should have any law, that, by proper judges, should be found suitable. Is it your <HI>oppression</HI> that the <HI>officers fees</HI> are not settled by an act of Assembly? No man can be a greater enemy to extortion, than myself: do, therefore, allow such fees as may reasonably encourage fit persons to undertake these offices, and you shall soon have (and should have always cheerfully had) mine, and, I hope, my Lieute∣nant's concurrence and approbation. Is it such an <HI>oppression,</HI> that licences for public houses have not been settled, as has been proposed? It is a certain sign you are strangers to <HI>oppression,</HI> and know nothing but the name, when you so highly bestow it on matters so inconsiderable; but that business, I find, is adjusted. Could I know any <HI>real oppression,</HI> you lie under, that is in my power to remedy (and what I wish you would take pro∣per
<PB N="52" REF="034421_0052_0FFD9EC500199AB0"/>
measures to remedy, if you truly feel any such) I would be as ready, on my part, to remove them, as you to desire it; but according to the best judgment, I can make of the complaints, I have seen (and you once thought I had a pretty good one) I must, in a deep sense of sorrow, say, that I fear, the kind hand of Providence, that has so long favoured and protected you, will, by the ingratitude of many there to the great mercies of God, hitherto shewn them, be, at length, pro∣voked to convince them of their unworthiness; and, by changing the blessings, that so little care has been taken, by the public, to deserve, into calamities, and reduce those, that have been so clamorous, and causelessly discontented, to a true, but smarting sense of their duty. I write not this, with a design to include all; I doubt not, many of you have been burdened at, and can, by no means, join in the measures that have been taken; but while such things appear under the name of an Assembly, that ought to represent the whole, I cannot but speak more generally than I would de∣sire, though I am not unsensible what methods may be used to obtain the weight of such a name.</P>
<P>I have already been tedious, and shall now, therefore, briefly say, that the opposition, I have met with from thence must, at length, force me to consider more closely of my own private and sinking circumstances, in relation to that province. In the mean time, I desire you all seriously to weigh what I have wrote, together with your duty to yourselves, to me, and to the world, who have their eyes upon you, and are witnesses of my early and earnest care for you. I must think there is a regard due to me, that has not of late been paid; pray, consider of it fully, and think soberly, what you have to desire of me, on the one hand, and ought to perform to me, on the other; for, from
<PB N="53" REF="034421_0053_0FFD9ECAFA1648F8"/>
the next Assembly, I shall expect to know what you resolve, and what I may depend on. If I must continue my regards to you, let me be en∣gaged to it by a like disposition in you towards me. But, if a plurality, after this, shall think they owe me none, or no more, than for some years I have met with, let it, on a fair election, be so de∣clared, and I shall then, without further suspense, know what I have to rely upon. God give you his wisdom and fear, to direct you, that yet our poor country may be blessed with peace, love and industry, and we may once more meet good friends, and live so to the end; our relation, in the truth, having but the same true interest.</P>

<P>What reply was made to this letter does not ap∣pear; but notwithstanding what might have been thought deficient, or amiss, on the Proprietary's side, the serious nature of it could not but affect the considerate part of the Assembly with more regard for the father of their country, now, in his declining age, and for his difficult situation, occasioned originally and principally on account of it, or, for the real advantage of the colony, than they had, for some time past, exhibited; seeing it plainly hinted to what their proceedings necessarily tended, and the means, though not expressed, which he should soon be obliged to use, without an immediate alteration of the Assembly's conduct, relative to him and his interest.

</LETTER>
<P>The congress of Governors, or council of war, met accordingly at <HI>New London,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> where the several quotas, or proportions, expected from each colony, were fixed; but by reason of the short space of time, and great distance, Go∣vernor <HI>Gookin</HI> could not attend it, nor properly represent the state and ability of the province; and the Assembly of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> thought the colony over-rated:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indi∣ans a con∣stant ex∣pense to Pennsylva∣nia, &amp;c.</NOTE> for this province particularly was con∣stantly at a considerable expense, for the preser∣vation of the friendship of the Indians, in such manner, as was very important and interesting to all the neighbouring governments, and the gene∣ral utility; they nevertheless voted <HI>two thousand pounds,</HI> to be raised upon the inhabitants of the province, for the Queen's use, by a tax of five pence half penny per pound, on estates, and twenty shillings per head, on single freemen: and a bill for that purpose was passed by the Governor.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="034421_0057_0FFD9E09C8BF6CF8"/>In the Assembly, elected October, 1711, there was a considerable change of Members; and <HI>Da∣vid Lloyd</HI>'s name again appears among them; but <HI>Richard Hill</HI> was chosen Speaker.</P>
<P>The Governor, in a speech to the House, this winter, expressed, That the Proprietary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietor de∣sires to serve the people of the pro∣vince, &amp;c.</NOTE> in his let∣ters to him, had signified his desire to serve the people of this province, and left it to themselves, to think on the means, that might best conduce to their own quiet and interest: at the same time, offering his ready concurrence to any thing of that nature, which they should propose, consist∣ent with the honour and interest of the crown, of the Proprietary, and of the public welfare; and recommending to their consideration, that, as to himself, he had been above three years engaged in the affairs of the province, and almost so long in it; that what he had received from the public, ap∣peared by the acts of the last Assembly; which was far short of what the Proprietary gave him to expect from the people.</P>
<P>The House, in answer, thankfully acknowledged the Proprietary's kind regard, and desires to serve them, with the Governor's offered and ready con∣currence to what should contribute to that end. They promised to take care of the Governor's support; and accordingly, afterwards agreed on such provision for the same, as was to mutual satisfaction.</P>
<P>The year 1712 was remarkable for two things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1712.</NOTE> respecting <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> the first was, an agree∣ment for the sale of the government of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietor dis∣poses of the govern∣ment to the Queen;</NOTE> and the territories, to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> by the Proprietary; the most probable inducements for which have already, in part, been mentioned: for though a temporary alteration was made the last year in the Assembly's conduct, respecting him, yet it appears, in this manner, he thought it most prudent to ex∣tricate
<PB N="58" REF="034421_0058_0FFD9E0B4B36F8C0"/>
himself from the debt and difficulties, in which the province had too much involved him. The second was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is seiz∣ed with an apoplexy, &amp;c.</NOTE> a failure of those mental facul∣ties, in the Proprietary, which, during most of his life, had shone so bright, and been so benefi∣cent to many people, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> by means of a distemper, supposed to be an apo∣plexy; which deprived him, in part, of his former abilities, and rendered him incapable of public business, and consequently disabled him from exe∣cuting a surrender of the government, according to agreement.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Gookin,</HI> in his speech to the Assem∣bly, on the 15th of October, this year, of which <HI>Isaac Norris</HI> was Speaker, thus hinted the former of these affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purport of the Govern∣or's speech to the As∣sembly.</NOTE> expressing, That the Proprietary, in a letter to a Member of the Council, had signified his intentions of surrendering the government, in a few months: in consequence of which he had reason to believe, he should not be continued Go∣vernor under the crown; he declared his readiness to serve them, during the short time he should probably be in the administration; and he request∣ed them to take effectual measures, to have ready, when called for, the sum granted by the late As∣sembly; that the debts incurred, on account of the <HI>Indian treaties,</HI> be immediately discharged, and that the <HI>Indians,</HI> then in town, be well satis∣fied; who had proposed, in behalf of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to establish a free and open trade between them, in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> for the future.

<P>We were in hopes, that the opening of the courts of justice might have been a means to put a stop to those tumults, which frequently happen∣ed in this city, since the beginning of our session,
<PB N="64" REF="034421_0064_0FFD9E77B63B06B0"/>
so that our meeting now would have been to crown our labours with a general satisfaction.</P>
<P>But, to our great disappointment, we un∣derstand, by credible information, that some of those who occasioned those tumults, in order to annoy their opposite party, are now levelling their malignity against the Magistrates of this city and county, and endeavouring to prevail with the Governor to be of opinion, that here is no power to bring to trial a certain clergyman, who is charged by indictment, at the King's suit, for committing <HI>fornication,</HI> against the King's peace, and the law of this province, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The chiefs of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Schuylkill Indians,</HI> in a visit to the Governor, &amp;c met in the court house, at <HI>Philadelphia; Sassoonan</HI> being their head, and <HI>Opessah,</HI> the late <HI>Shawanese</HI> king, with his companions attending him; and then opening the <HI>Calamet,</HI> with great ceremony of their rattles and songs, it was offered by <HI>Sassoonan,</HI> the king, to the Go∣vernor and Council, and to all others of the <HI>English</HI> there met; and af∣terwards it was also offered by him to all his <HI>Indians;</HI> and then with the same ceremony was put up again.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Sassoonan</HI> rose, and spoke to the Governor, and said, "That the <HI>Calumet,</HI> the bond of peace, which they had carried to all the nations round, they had now brought hither; that it was a sure bond and seal of peace amongst them, and between them and us; and they desired, by holding up their hands, that the <HI>God of heaven</HI> might be witness to it, and that there might be a firm peace between them and us for ever."</P>
<P>To which the Governor answered;</P>
<P>That he was very glad to see them retain so strong a sense of that firm peace, which was settled between <HI>William Penn,</HI> the Founder and Chief Governor of this country, at his first coming into it, in behalf of himself, and all his people, with them and all theirs; that they were sensible we had always preserved it unviolated, on our side; and were glad we had reason to say, they had done the same, on theirs; that we d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sired nothing more, than that the great <HI>God,</HI> who made heaven and earth, and all living creatures, and who knew the thoughts, and saw all the actions of men, to whom they applied, should be witness of what
 
 <!-- PB 65 -->
 <PB N="65" REF="034421_0065_0FFD9E3F8721E1C8"/>

 now passed between us; and, that this renewal of the same bond of peace might be recorded between them and us, for ever.</P>
<P>With which speech they expressed themselves greatly satisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Sassoonan</HI> added, that hearing of some murmurs among some of themselves, to prevent any misunderstanding, they came to renew the former bond of friendship:—That <HI>William Penn</HI> had, at his first coming, made a clear and open road, all the way to the <HI>Indians;</HI> [by this meaning a friendly communication] that they desired the same might be kept open; and that all obstructions should be removed; of which, on their side, they will take care.</P>
<P>He then presented a belt of <HI>Wampum,</HI> and added to the same effect:</P>
<P>That they desired the peace, which had been made, should be so firm; that they and we should join hand in hand so firmly, that nothing, even the <HI>greatest tree,</HI> should be able to divide them asunder.</P>
<P>After this, they, seeming to wait for an answer, were desired to pro∣ceed, and to deliver what they now had further to say; and that answers and returns, for binding the friendship, on our side, would be made to them altogether.</P>
<P><HI>Sassoonan</HI> accordingly proceeded and said, That their late king <HI>Skalit∣chi</HI> desired of them that they would take care to keep a perfect with the <HI>English,</HI> and that they should be joined as one; that the <HI>Indians</HI> should be half <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> make themselves as half <HI>Indians,</HI> that they might the better be as the same.</P>
<P>He further added, laying down a second belt, That, as the fathers have been in peace, so they desired that their children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d our children still, as they should be born, and come into the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, might be brought up in the same union; and that it should be continued between their and our posterity, from generation to generation for ever.</P><!-- PB 66 -->
<PB N="66" REF="034421_0066_0FFD9E4F41D4EAF8"/>
<P>He added, That, in the last council, which they held with us, they spoke concerning the sun; by whose influence they had lived in warmth and plenty, from the beginning; that they now desired the same happi∣ness might be continued to them with us, in the firmest peace; and that it might last as long as the sun should endure: that when any clouds in∣terpose between them and the sun, it brings coolness, and is unpleasant; the same will be, if any cloud should arise between them and us; and, therefore, they desire, if any thing of that kind appear, it may be dissi∣pated, without delay.</P>
<P>He laid down a third belt, and continued in the same strain, desiring as before, that they might still enjoy the warmth of the sun, and our friend∣ship together; that then they should want no necessaries of life, but en∣joying all the comforts of it, with their wives, and might repose them∣selves with them in peace and safety, without any disturbance.</P>
<P>This he delivered in behalf of all our <HI>Indians,</HI> on this side <HI>Susque∣hanna,</HI> who are all concerned with him in this treaty; and this was all he had to say on this subject.</P>
<P>He then began again, and laying down a bundle of deer skins, said, That now they would discourse of matters of trade between them and us; that hitherto it had been like a house with two doors, one for them, the other for the <HI>English;</HI> but the goods were placed in the dark; so that they were wholly ignorant how they had been dealt with, or how they should trade.</P>
<P>He repeated the same, laying down a second bundle of skins, and de∣sired they might be informed of the terms, they might trade upon, that if occasion were, they might, at any time, send their wives, and be out of danger of being cheated.</P>
<P>He added a third bundle of deer skins, complaining how hard it was upon them; for that they knew not what they were to expect for their goods, and that they could scarce purchase ours.</P>
<P>Laying down a fourth bundle, being skins and furs, he desired, that we might be as people, eating all of the same dish, and so they might be dealt with, as if they were our own people.</P>
<P>Presenting a fifth bundle, he said, that formerly they exactly knew the prices both of our goods and theirs; but now they varied so much, there was no understanding them.</P><!-- PB 67 -->
<PB N="67" REF="034421_0067_0FFD9E3419BAD290"/>
<P>With a sixth bundle, he said, That through this uncertainty, he wore himself such ragged breeches, that he was ashamed to shew them, and desired this inconveniency might be remedied.</P>
<P>Offering a seventh, he complained that they were often imposed on by the weight of our money, when they came to sell, that we certainly knew the value of theirs; but they could not understand ours; and, therefore, desired that this great inconveniency might also be remedied.</P>
<P>He offered an eighth, informing, that <HI>Opessah</HI> (formerly king of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> but now abdicated) lived at a great distance, and entertained them with victuals and provisions, when they went that way; and there∣fore they desired, that when he should come among us, he might be re∣ceived as one of themselves, with the same openness, that he received from them.</P>
<P>Having ended their discourse, they were told, that to-morrow they should receive answers to all they had said; and were, for the present, dismissed.</P>
<P>Orders were given to the Mayor of <HI>Philadelphia, Isaac Norris,</HI> and the Secretary, to take an account of the presents, now made, and their value; and that goods should be provided, to be ready in the morning; and the said presents were found to consist of,</P>

<P>Presents having been prepared, according to order, and the <HI>Indians</HI> being met and seated, the Governor ordered the interpreter to inform them, "That their visit, on so friendly a design, as still further to strength∣en the bond of Peace between us, was very acceptable; that we doubted not but they would think themselves, and their children from generation to generation, obliged to keep inviolable those firm treaties of peace, which had been made, and which we had kept, and were resolved ever to keep firm, on our side; and hope none of them have any cause to murmur: if they knew of any, they are desired to mention it freely.</P>
<P>That the great <HI>Queen of England,</HI> who had, for so many years, reigned with great success, was now dead, and was succeeded by a King, who has been a great General, in the wars, is a wise King, and has more dominions, than any King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> ever had before him; that under him, as well they (the <HI>Indians</HI>) as we, his other subjects, may live in the same peace, that we have enjoyed any time before; that our Proprietary, their Friend, <HI>William Penn,</HI> is still living, though but weak in health.</P>
<P>That, as to the complaints, they made concerning trade, the Go∣vernor is sorry he cannot give them a more entire satisfaction in it, and <!-- PB 69 -->
<PB N="69" REF="034421_0069_0FFD9E51A9191670"/>

remove every hardship, which they lie under; but that all trade is un∣certain; our own wheat the last year, yielded twice the price, it does this; all our goods, which they buy, are brought from <HI>England,</HI> whi∣ther we also send theirs; that sometimes a habit, which is in fashion one year, is laid aside the next; and accordingly the skins, of which they are made, will be of a higher or lower value. It is the same with all our other merchandize, as with those which they buy; their only security and safety will be, to trade with the honestest men, and those of the best reputation, and prefer those who will give the most; that this is our rule, in all our business, and they must do the same.</P>
<P>That <HI>Opessah</HI> has long been under a league of friendship with us; and though he has now left those <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom he formerly lived, yet we shall shew him the same friendship as ever; and shall depend upon the same from him; and that, upon this further recommendation from them, he will think himself as one of them, and under the same bond with them; and, therefore, we desire, that, as he lives at a great dis∣tance, and may see many foreign <HI>Indians,</HI> he will, from time to time, inform us, if he hears of any thing, which may concern us; and this we desire, and shall expect and depend on from him, and all his friends there; as also that, if they know any thing now of any late motions to or from the southward, they would acquaint us.</P>
<P>Concerning which, being particularly asked, <HI>Opessah</HI> affirmed, he knew nothing.</P>
<P>The Governor further ordered, they should be told, That all the sober <HI>English</HI> very much lamented that they could not guard themselves better against liquor; that they should send their young men abroad to hunt, and, at their return, should sell their goods for such things as would be of real service to them, and not throw it all away for that de∣structive liquor <HI>rum;</HI> which robbed them, not only of their goods, but of their lives also</P>
<P>All which being delivered together with the presents, which were provided, <HI>Pokehais,</HI> in the name of the rest, expressed their satisfaction and thanks, for the savours now shewed them."</P>

<P>Though by divers concurring causes, and particularly the great indisposition of our Pro∣prietary and Governor in chief of this province,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Proprietary, as before deserved, had, in the year 1712. been so affected, as to his health, (supposed to be by an apoplexy) that, in a great treasure, from that time forward, he became more and more inca∣pable of public business, till his death, in 1718.</NOTE> we have been hitherto, to our great trouble, pre∣vented the opportunity of expressing to the <HI>King</HI> our sincere joy, for his happy and peaceable ac∣cession to the throne of his ancestors, and thereby securing to all his protestant subjects the full en∣joyment of their religious and civil rights; yet none could be more sensible of the great blessing, nor express a warmer zeal for his service, in their earliest approaches, than, at all times since, has filled our thankful breasts; and although we had not the desired advantage of expressing these our sentiments, yet we became the easier under that disappointment, by accounting the majority of this province included in that general application, made by their friends at <HI>London,</HI> in behalf of the
<PB N="71" REF="034421_0071_0FFD9E17E6F92088"/>
whole community, wherein our thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1716.</NOTE> with their own, were most truly represented.</P>
<P>Such has been the King's goodness, not only expressed in his first generous royal declaration, and repeatedly since, from the throne, but more powerfully exerted through a most wise and stea∣dy administration, in pursuing every measure, that might contribute to the safety and happiness of his people; in making the known laws the invaria∣ble rule of his government; in restoring the ho∣nour of the <HI>British nation</HI> abroad; and in procur∣ing for his subjects such advantages, in commerce, as could scarce be hoped for, after they had been so unhappily given away, that, even, the remotest parts of the King's great dominions feel the be∣nign influences of his paternal affection to the whole, and are laid under doubled obligations to make the utmost returns of gratitude, as well as obedience, for their happiness, under his auspicious reign.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, the more surprising, that there should be any of the <HI>British</HI> race, within that <HI>Island,</HI> so lost to all sense of their own inte∣rest, as well as their engaged duty to a Prince of the most conspicuous and most consummate virtues, as to express the least uneasy murmurs, much less to rise in an open and unnatural rebellion; for the suppression of which, by the great wisdom and vigilance of the <HI>King,</HI> and his ministry, and faithfulness of his servants, we do, with hearts full of the sincerest gratitude and joy, return our most humble acknowledgments to the Fountain of infinite goodness and mercy, that has so eminent∣ly appeared in the support of the royal throne, established on the lasting foundation of justice, and to the confusion of all the detestable machi∣nations, vainly formed against it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="034421_0072_0FFD9E6DC9DA1C28"/>As for us, our known principles are so essen∣tially interwoven with the protestant interest of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and our greatest concerns do so entirely depend on the preservation of thy person, and royal issue, long to reign over us, that we cannot possibly separate our own welfare from the indispensible duty of shewing ourselves with the most hearty affection, thy loyal and most obedient subjects.</P>
<P>That confusion and disapointment may at∣tend all the wicked devices of thy enemies; that the minds of thy people may be composed, and universally inspired with the same spirit of love and obedience, as that, wherewith we now ap∣proach thy throne; and that the watchful provi∣dence of Almighty God may always attend the <HI>King,</HI> and confirm the wisdom and justice of his rightful government over us, is the most sincere and unfeigned desire of the King's humble and dutiful subjects.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly's repre∣sentation to Governor Gookin.</NOTE>A <HI>representation</HI> of the freemen of the said pro∣vince, in General Assembly met, the third of the ninth month, 1716.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When our Proprietary and Governor in Chief, first obtained a grant of this province from the crown, and a numerous colony of industrious people settled therein, we are well assured it was his inclination, as well as visible interest, to ren∣der them as safe as possible, under his administra∣tion.</P>
<P>And, as his religious persuasion, as a dissen∣ter from the established <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> was well known, and therefore those of the same profession made a great part of the first adventurers with him, it cannot be doubted but that he would ever think himself obliged to provide that they should enjoy, in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> at least, equal ease and privileges with any other <HI>English</HI> subjects of the same rank, in any of the King's dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly when necessitated to be absent from us, as he has, for the most part been, he took care, from time to time, to appoint such persons, to be his deputies, in the government, in whose moderation and tenderness towards his friends, as well as loyalty to the crown, and jus∣tice to all its subjects, he believed he might confide.</P>
<P>When the Governor, therefore, first brought over the Proprietary's commission of deputation, for the government, we could not doubt but that, being the Proprietary's choice, and acting solely by powers, derived from him, he would steadily pursue the measures, that had generally been ta∣ken, from our first settlement, and endeavour to make all the subjects of the crown, under the Proprietary's government, equally secure and easy.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="034421_0075_0FFD9E375140C750"/>On this expectation, confirmed by the Pro∣prietary's letters of recommendation, the Assem∣blies, not doubting the Governor's good intentions towards them, freely discharged what was incum∣bent on them, and it is hoped, in no small mea∣sure, to the Governor's satisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor while the Proprietary's health, and for∣mer abilities happily continued, had the inhabitants much reason to complain, but that the Governor made the Proprietary's directions, from home, as far as they could be obtained, and the advice of those, the Proprietary had instructed here, the rule (in great measure) of his conduct, in what related to the Proprietary's interest, or govern∣ment, and to the privileges of the people.</P>
<P>But whether it be now owing to the discon∣tinuance of those orders and directions, which has followed on the late great and melancholy change, in the Proprietary's health, or to some unhappy advice from others, or to any new formed views, we know not; but this House of Repre∣sentatives, soon after their first meeting, finding the Governor had, at length, so far lost sight of the obligations he lay under to his principal and con∣stituent, as to enter on measures inconsistent with his interest, and our constitution, and the liberties of the people, we judged it our indispensible duty to apply to the Governor for redress; who declaring his opinion to be such as would not admit of any, we desired, with due submission, that he would be pleased to suffer the reasons of that opinion to be argued before him; but finding, to our trou∣ble, that all our endeavours were in vain, we think ourselves obliged, in the discharge of the trust reposed in us, fully to represent the fatal consequences, as well as the unreasonableness, of those measures, to the end that a proper relief may be obtained; without which the greater part
<PB N="76" REF="034421_0076_0FFD9EAFABDF7200"/>
of the inhabitants of this province must be ren∣dered miserable; which we humbly offer, as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>Those, who accompanied the Proprietary in the settlement of this colony, being chiefly (as has already been observed) of those called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> who, lying under some hardships, in their native country, because, for conscience-sake, they could not comply with the laws there, for taking oaths, expected that, by virtue of the powers of legislation, granted by the crown, to the Proprie∣tary and them, they might, after the hazard and toil of their removal hither, be capable of enjoy∣ing the privileges of English subjects, without violation of their religious principles.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Proprietary and Assemblies provided laws, by which those people might be enabled to hold any offices (there being but few others at that time, to fill them) or to give evi∣dence in any case whatsoever.</P>
<P>Some disputes afterwards arising on this sub∣ject, the late Queen, by her order, in Council, dated the 21st of January, 1702, was pleased to extend to this province, the <HI>affirmation</HI> allowed to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> by the seventh and eighth of <HI>William</HI> the Third, not only for the pur∣poses intended by that in <HI>England,</HI> but also for the qualification of Magistrates and officers; and the same being from thence applied to other cases, this order, on the repeal of our own acts, in a great measure, supplied what was necessary, in this point, for the administration of justice.</P>
<P>But the act of parliament itself being near its expiration, it was found necessary, as well on that, as some other considerations, to establish, by an act of the province, the qualifications of officers, and the manner of giving evidence, by affirmation; and the Governor (upon the Assem∣bly's
<PB N="77" REF="034421_0077_0FFD9E6F70983F20"/>
performing the conditions proposed them) passed acts for that, as well as other purposes, to answer the exigencies of the government.</P>
<P>That the said affirmation-acts should have full force, according to the intention of them, of such importance to the ease and security of the whole province, that it could scarcely be suppos∣ed, any person amongst us, who professed, even, the most slender regard for the people's welfare, would attempt to deprive them of the advantages thereof.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, the more surprising, that the Governor himself (from whose station, and the trust reposed in him, by our Proprietary, the most tender concern for the safety and well-being of all his Majesty's subjects, under his care, might reasonably be expected) should be the principal, if not the first, person, in the government, who would render the intention of those acts void to us, though passed by himself into laws so lately before, by publicly declaring his opinions, in such manner, as would render the said acts repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> and repealed by the act of parliament of the first of his present Majesty; in pursuance of which opinion, he has refused to qualify such persons for offices, that could not take the oath, according to the law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The consequence of which is, that, as no <HI>Quaker</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is qualified, or permit∣ted, to give evidence, in any criminal causes, or serve on any juries, or bear any office, or place of profit, in the government; so, should the same hold, in this colony, not only the great number of the first adventurers, with their descendants, of the same profession, are to be wholly excluded from having any part, or share, in the administra∣tion of justice, and the execution of the laws of the country, (which, as it would be a general in∣conveniency,
<PB N="78" REF="034421_0078_0FFD9E1A7531BCA0"/>
so would it throw the burden too hea∣vily on a few of the inhabitants) but, what is of no less importance, for the security of those of other professions, the greatest outrages and barbarities, against any person, may be committed, in the face of any number of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the male∣factors, though brought to trial, must escape with impunity, for want of legal evidence, if that of the <HI>Quakers</HI> is not to be so accounted; of which the Governor cannot forget a very memorable in∣stance, when (at a time, that unhappily there was no act of the province, for an <HI>affirmation,</HI> but the Queen's order was thought sufficient, during that interval, for all but capital cases) it is presumed a murderer escaped the sentence, that was due to him, for want of such evidence, as was esteemed legal, though more than one <HI>Quaker</HI> appeared in court, who were witnesses to the fact.</P>
<P>But, besides these inconveniencies, however great, there remains one further consequence of that construction of the act, which, perhaps, the Governor is not sufficiently advised of; which is, That, if no <HI>Quaker,</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> nor the <HI>Plantations,</HI> can bear any office, or place of pro∣fit, in the government, some may judge it a natu∣ral inference, that the Proprietary himself is equally affected by it; and then all powers derived from him, as well those lodged in the Governor, by his deputation, as the magistracy and inferior offi∣cers, fall together.</P>
<P>Having thus far pointed out the destructive consequences of that opinion, should it fully take place in this province, we judge it, in the next place, incumbent on us, in duty to the Governor, and for the discharge of the trust, reposed in us, by those we represent, to offer to the consideration of the Governor, and all others concerned, such reasons as have occurred to us, in our enquiry into
<PB N="79" REF="034421_0079_0FFD9E71E7D864C8"/>
this head; which we hope (with submission) will render it incontestibly evident that the affirmation-acts of this province are in full force; and are neither repealed, nor affected by any act of parli∣ament, that has come to our knowledge; but that the Governor is obliged to take care that the same be equally, with any other act, put duly in execu∣tion.</P>
<P>By the same royal charter of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, by which this province, with licence to transport an ample colony thereunto, was granted to our Proprietary, and the Governor in Chief, the said King grants to him and his heirs, &amp;c. pow∣er to make laws jointly with the people; and di∣rects the force and limitation of them, in the fol∣lowing words, as they stand in divers parts of the said charter, but are here collected, <HI>viz,</HI></P>
<P>We, reposing special trust and confidence in the fidelity, wisdom, justice and provident circum∣spection of the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> for us and our heirs and successors, do grant free, full and abso∣lute power, by virtue of these presents, to him and his heirs, and their deputies and lieutenants, for the good and happy government of the said country, to ordain, make, enact, and, under his and their seals, to publish any law whatsoever, for raising of money, for the public uses of the said province, or for any other end, &amp;c. by and with the advice, assent and approbation of the freemen of the said country, or the greater part of them, or of their delegates, &amp;c. and the same laws duly to execute unto and upon all people within the said country, and limits thereof; which laws, so as aforesaid to be published, our pleasure is, and so we enjoin, require and command, shall be most absolute and available in law: and that all the liege people and subjects of us, our heirs and successors, do observe and keep the same inviola∣bly
<PB N="80" REF="034421_0080_0FFDA17576E3C5E8"/>
in those parts, so far as they concern them, under the penalties therein expressed, or to be ex∣pressed, <HI>Provided nevertheless,</HI> That the said laws be consonant to reason, and be not repugnant, or contrary, but as near as conveniently may be, agreeable to the laws, statutes and rights of this our kingdom of <HI>England. And our further will and pleasure is,</HI> That the laws for regulating and governing property, within the said province, as well for the descent and enjoyment of lands, as likewise for the enjoyment of succession of goods and chattels, and likewise felonies, shall be and continue the same as they shall be, for the time be∣ing, by the general course of the law, in our king∣dom of <HI>England,</HI> until the said laws shall be alter∣ed by the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> his heirs and assigns, and by the freemen of the said province, their de∣legates, or their deputies, or the greater part of them. And to the end that the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> his heirs, or others, the planters, owners, or in∣habitants of the said province, may not, at any time hereafter, by misconstruction of the powers aforesaid, through inadvertency, or design, depart from that faith, and due allegiance, which, by the laws of this our realm of <HI>England,</HI> they, and all our subjects, in our dominions and territories, always owe unto us, our heirs and successors, &amp;c. <HI>Our further will and pleasure is,</HI> That a transcript or duplicate of all laws, which shall be, as aforesaid, made and published, within the said province, shall, within five years after the making thereof, be trans∣mitted and delivered to the Privy Council, for the time being, of us, our heirs and successors; and if any of the said laws, within the space of six months, after they shall be so, as aforesaid, transmitted and delivered, be declared by us, our heirs and succes∣sors, in our or their Privy Council, inconsistent with the sovereignty, or lawful prerogative of us, our heirs, or successors, or contrary to the faith and
<PB N="81" REF="034421_0081_0FFD9E55115A1F98"/>
allegiance due, by the legal government of this realm, from the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> or of the plant∣ers, or inhabitants of this province; and that thereupon any of the said laws shall be adjudged and declared to be void, by us, our heirs or suc∣cessors, under our, or their privy seal, that then, and from thenceforth, such laws, concerning which such judgment and declaration shall be made, shall become void, otherwise the said laws, so transmit∣ted, shall remain and stand in full force, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</P>
<P>Pursuant to these powers, the said acts of this province, for an affirmation, were made and pub∣lished. And though a considerable part of the five years, limited in the charter, is yet unexpired, the same have been duly transmitted; nor have we heard any thing, but that they are, or may be, well approved of; having reason to hope, that they contain nothing, for which (according to the tenor of the said royal charter) they ought to be declared void; and, therefore, are of as full force, as absolute and available, and to be observed and kept as inviolably as any law whatsoever, that can be enacted in this province, and ought accordingly to be as duly executed by the Governor, to the full extent thereof.</P>
<P>But the Governor, in answer to a resolution of this House of the 18th of October last, which was, That the royal charter makes the acts of this province most absolute and available in law, until repealed by the King, is pleased to say, That he joins with the Assembly, in this resolve, provided the laws are not repugnant to the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and by the following paragraph, in the same an∣swer, which is, That he allows the laws of the province had settled the qualifications of Magis∣trates and other officers, until the publication of the act of King <HI>George,</HI> relating thereto, he has,
<PB N="82" REF="034421_0082_0FFD9E3C7522E7C0"/>
at last, thought fit to give so much under his hand, as his opinion, the natural construction whereof is, that the said affirmation-acts of this province (being the subject then in hand) were repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> and repealed by the said act of parliament.</P>
<P>But this we humbly offer, That, if it must be termed repugnant, because it differs from, or is not the same with, the act of parliament, then the clause of the royal charter, which grants pow∣er to the Governor and Assembly here to alter the laws of <HI>England,</HI> for the descent of lands, enjoy∣ing estates, and punishing felonies, in the province (as is above recited from the said charter) appears to be useless and vain.</P>
<P>But it is further to be considered, That, as the term <HI>repugnant,</HI> always implies an absolute opposition, or contrariety, in matter, it cannot be said that an act of this province, which ena∣bles those, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to serve in offices, upon juries, and to be evidence, in all cases (the circumstances of the country requiring that it should be so) is contrary to an act of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which enables them only to give evidence in civil cases; these two differ, it is true, and so it was certainly considered and expected, at the time of the royal grant, that our acts might, in some mea∣sure, differ from those in <HI>England;</HI> otherwise those in <HI>England</HI> would suffice; and no such power for altering them needed to have been granted: on the contrary, the act of this province, pursuant to the directions of that royal charter, is as nearly agreeable, as to our conveniency may be, to the statute provided for <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But the Governor, we presume, could not intend, by his answer, That this act, at the time of passing it, was repugnant to any of the laws of <HI>England,</HI> though it differed from them, for in
<PB N="83" REF="034421_0083_0FFD9E3DF7D42CE0"/>
that, certainly, he could not have given it his sanc∣tion; it must, therefore, be meant, that it is be∣come <HI>repugnant</HI> only since the supposed publication of the <HI>British</HI> act, which he conceives repealed it; or, to state what can be alledged on that head, in its full force, and the plainest terms it will bear, that the act of the first of king <HI>George,</HI> entitled, <HI>An act for making perpetual an act of the seventh and eighth years of the reign of his late Majesty, King William the Third,</HI> entitled, An act, <HI>That the so∣lemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers, should be accepted instead of an oath, in the usual form,</HI> &amp;c. extends to this province that act of King <HI>William,</HI> by these words in the last clause of it, viz. <HI>Provided always,</HI> That so much of this act, as relates to the affirmations to be made by the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> shall be ex∣tended to that part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> called Scot∣land, for ever, and to the plantations belonging to the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for five years, &amp;c. Therefore, that, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> are not permit∣ted, by that act, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to hold offices, serve on juries, or be evidence in criminal cases, so, by its being extended to the plantations, they are as effectually disabled there, and that all acts of this province, for qualifying <HI>Quakers,</HI> in these cases, are, by the superior force of this act of parliament, repealed, and made utterly void.</P>
<P>But when the language of the act itself comes to be considered, the whole seeming force of this objection will, we presume, entirely disap∣pear; the clause of limitation, in the seventh and eighth of <HI>William</HI> the Third, is in these words: <HI>"Provided, and be it enacted, That no Quaker, or reputed Quaker, shall, by virtue of this act, be qualified or permitted, to give evidence, in any cri∣minal causes, to serve on any juries, to bear any of∣fice, or place of profit, in the government, any thing in this act contained to the contrary notwithstanding."</HI>

Upon which we conceive that Brigadier <HI>Hunter,</HI> Governor, under his Majesty, of the provinces of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI> has (in a case pa∣rallel with ours) observed, in his printed declarati∣on on that subject, under the title of, "An answer to what has been offered, as argument against the validity and force of an act of Assembly, entitled, <HI>An act, that the solemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. passed in the pro∣vince of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> in the thirteenth year of the reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> to be of such force, as to be worthy our recital: in which, after he has ob∣served, in general, in the following words:— "Into what a woful condition must the planta∣tions be plunged, if such laws as shall, by a Legi∣slature lawfully constituted by virtue of letters patent, under the broad seal, be enacted for the good government and ease of the subjects there, shall, by implication, or construction, be deemed to be repealed!" &amp;c. he is pleased to say, that act of Assembly is not so much as, by implication, repealed; for the words of that act, upon which they lay the stress of the argument, are these, <HI>Provided, that no Quaker shall, by virtue of this act, be qualified,</HI> &amp;c. Now I know no <HI>Quaker,</HI> continues that gentleman, that pretends he is, or can, by virtue of that act, be qualified; but I believe every <HI>Quaker</HI> thinks that he is, or may be, qualified by an act of Assembly, entitled, An act, that the solemn affirmation and declaration of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. passed in the pro∣vince, and sent home, &amp;c. It is as plain as words can make it, that that act, of the seventh and eighth of King <HI>William,</HI> has no negative, but upon itself, and consequently cannot be alledged in bar to any laws already enacted, in the plantations, or even such as may be enacted; for, by these letters patent, which gave a being to this govern∣ment and Legislature, all such laws, as shall be
<PB N="85" REF="034421_0085_0FFD9E754F4A98B8"/>
enacted by the Governor, Council and Assembly, are declared to be in full force, from the time of enacting.</P>
<P>The same worthy gentleman and Governor is further pleased, in the said print, to publish an instruction from the late Queen, in whose reign that act of Assembly was made, directing him to pass such an act in <HI>New Jersey;</HI> by which instruc∣tion her Majesty was pleased further to declare her will and pleasure, "That such of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as shall be found capable of serv∣ing in her Council, the General Assembly, and in other places of trust and profit, in <HI>New Jersey,</HI> and accordingly be elected, or appointed, to serve therein, may, upon their taking and signing the declaration of allegiance to her Majesty, in the form, used by the same people, in <HI>England,</HI> to∣gether with a solemn declaration of the true dis∣charge of their respective trusts, be admitted by the Governor to any of the said places or employ∣ments." And he adds, "That the same instruc∣tions are, word for word, also contained in his present Majesty's instructions to the Governor, dated the first of July, 1715. By which it ap∣pears, that both the late Queen was, and his pre∣sent Majesty is, willing that the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> immediately under their government, in <HI>New Jersey,</HI> should enjoy the full privileges, which are craved here, as due to the people, we represent, by their charteral rights, under the government of our Proprietary, <HI>William Penn.</HI></P>
<P>To this we may add what has also been ob∣served, on the same subject, by the Chief Justice of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> in his speech, delivered at the supreme court, in May last, at <HI>Burlington,</HI> which is also printed; wherein he clearly gives his opinion in law, very nearly in the same terms, the Governor
<PB N="86" REF="034421_0086_0FFD9E41F141CD60"/>
had done before, and then proceeds, in these words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The act of parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is an enlargement of the <HI>Quakers</HI> privileges to what it never was before; it makes that perpetual to them, in <HI>England,</HI> which before was temporary and expired, or near expiring, by its own limita∣tion, carries the same into that part of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> where it was not before, and makes it perpetual there, and into the plan∣tations, generally, for five years. This does no way hinder, but that, by virtue of the act of As∣sembly of the province (which is a municipal law thereof) the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or reputed <HI>Quakers,</HI> are qualified to be of juries and evidence, and bear offices of trust and profit, in the government; nor, but that they may be so qualified hereafter, by any other law, hereafter to be made, for that, or the like purpose, although by virtue of that act of parliament, they are not so qualified.</P>
<P>Having thus far stated this point, we shall now leave it; but that we are obliged to give the sense of this House to that part of the Governor's answer to our resolves, in which he is pleased to say, That though he was of opinion he could not be safe in giving any qualification but an oath, yet by a <HI>dedimus</HI> they, (the officers and witnesses) might have been qualified, as the law directs.</P>
<P>On which we must humbly observe, That though it may be very certain a <HI>dedimus potestatem,</HI> duly issued by the Governor, is no less sufficient, in law, for administering qualifications to any officer, than the Governor's act, in his own per∣son; which, notwithstanding, the Governor has not of late, that we know of, condescended to, but refused to admit such of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as, by virtue of the Proprietary's charter to the people, were elected to serve in certain offices,
<PB N="87" REF="034421_0087_0FFD9E63695344F8"/>
until that more remarkable case of the last quali∣fication of the Mayor of <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> yet no such <HI>dedimus</HI> will answer the exigencies of this government, should the Governor's opinion ob∣tain: for should it be taken for granted, that the affirmation-act of this province is actually repealed by the act of parliament, then all such qualifica∣tions will be construed illegal, whether given by himself, or other persons, empowered by him. And as the Judges of the supreme court have ren∣dered their reasons to the House, for their not proceeding to try the criminals, now in the respec∣tive gaols of this province, viz. <HI>That they cannot think it prudent to proceed, by virtue of the Govern∣or's commission to them, in opposition to his opinion, in so tender a point, as the lives of his Majesty's sub∣jects:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of these Judges were, William Trent, Jonathan Dick∣inson and George Roach.</NOTE> so all others must be discouraged in cases of such vast consequence; for no <HI>dedimus</HI> will make that act sufficient, that is in itself illegal.</P>
<P>It has, by this time, we hope, clearly ap∣peared, from what has been offered, That the opinion of the Governor is (with submission) nei∣ther founded on law nor reason; but from hence we cannot but desire the Governor may be in∣duced more seriously and maturely to consider how unaccountable and astonishing it must appear to mankind, that, while such persons as Governor <HI>Hunter,</HI> who holds his commission directly from the crown, is accountable to no other principal, nor under obligations to any called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> as a superior, has thought it necessary, in the discharge of his trust, to publish his reasons, in such a man∣ner, for removing mistakes, and allaying the disturbances from thence fomented; at the same time, though such an example be set to us, at no greater distance, than the other bank of <HI>Delaware,</HI> our <HI>Proprietary, William Penn</HI>'s Lieutenant, in the
<PB N="88" REF="034421_0088_0FFD9E1DD044AC40"/>
province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> should be drawn into measures so injurious, not only to the interest of his principal, from which he derives his power, but to the very being of the constitution, over which he is entrusted to preside. We heartily wish we could, by any construction, find other causes, to which these procedures might be im∣puted, than a formed design; but we are justly alarmed at some other late proceedings of the Go∣vernor, which, as they have naturally fallen under our notice, we think ourselves also obliged, in du∣ty, to represent:</P>
<P>When the House had chosen their Speaker, and the Governor, without any objection, ap∣proved their choice, they proceeded to take the usual qualifications as the law, in that case, directs; but upon the rumours, that had been spread, of persons disaffected to his present Majesty, that this House might give the utmost expressions, they could, of their loyalty, they, by a message to the Governor, requested to know, if besides what they had taken as usual, the Governor had any directions from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or any other qua∣lification to offer to the House; to which, he was pleased to answer, <HI>he had not:</HI> the House notwith∣standing resolved to neglect no part of their duty, but to give all the assurances of their loyalty, in their power, thought fit unanimously to take and subscribe the test, called the <HI>abjuration,</HI> every one, in the way prescribed to them by the several acts of parliament, according to their religious persua∣sions, and then proceeded to the business before them.</P>
<P>But being informed that the Governor had, at divers times, and to sundry persons, charged the present Mayor of the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> now Speaker of the House, as a person disaffected to his Majesty, King <HI>George;</HI> and that he further
<PB N="89" REF="034421_0089_0FFD9E67A88FF4F8"/>
alledged, the only cause of difference betwixt him and the said Mayor, was, because the Governor would not agree to proclaim the Pretender, or words to the same effect; the House conceived themselves obliged, in duty to his said Majesty, to enquire into the grounds of this heinous charge, that, in case there should be any found▪ they might purge themselves of the scandal.</P>
<P>Accordingly, having, in a committee of the whole House, taken full proofs, that the Govern∣or had so charged the Speaker, and finding, by the same evidence, that he had, in the same man∣ner, also charged <HI>James Logan,</HI> Secretary of the province, they, by a message, desired of the Go∣vernor, that he would be pleased to lay before the House his grounds for these accusations; but he returned no other answer, than, "That he thought himself not obliged to render any reasons to the House for his accusation, but would do it at the board at home;" and the Members, sent on the message, could not persuade him to give any rea∣sons here.</P>
<P>The House thereupon judged it still the more incumbent on them to enquire fully into the mat∣ter; and accordingly they, by a written message, in∣formed the Governor, That, being under a deep concern, on all occasions, to shew their loyalty, as faithful subjects, to King <HI>George,</HI> they could, by no means, think themselves discharged of their duty, without further enquiring into the truth of the report, which they had received, and acquaint∣ed the Governor with, which affected their Speak∣er and another person, bearing considerable offices and trusts, in the government; and finding the Governor's answer to the last message, concerning the same, not satisfactory, they further acquainted him, that the House intended immediately to re∣solve into a committee, in order to enquire into
<PB N="90" REF="034421_0090_0FFD9EABB54CCA68"/>
that matter, and that the said committee would be desirous to receive from the Governor, or any other person, any information concerning the same, in order to proceed to the extent of what is their duty, and purge the House of any Mem∣ber, or Members thereof, that may appear, or shall be found guilty of disloyalty to the King, or disaffection to his government, under which the House unanimously declared themselves extremely happy, and well satisfied.</P>
<P>But the Governor, though another message was sent to him, to crave his answer, could not be prevailed on to give any, but that he had no∣thing to lay before them; the House notwith∣standing, while formed into a committee for that purpose, proceeded to make the utmost enquiries, in their power; but could not find the least ground to suspect the persons charged, or to believe the accusations, against them, had any manner of foundation.</P>
<P>Now what sentiments can be formed of such a conduct, in a person, acting in so exalted a sta∣tion, the House must acknowledge themselves to be at a loss to determine! But the House would consider it, as no small happiness to the whole province, could they be assured that the Govern∣or had no design, by his representations to any board, at home, to raise a merit to himself, on the ruin of others; who, could they be heard there, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly known, might be found as faith∣ful and loyal, in their stations, to the present esta∣blishment and succession, as any of the King's subjects whatsoever.</P>
<P>Had the Governor believed the Speaker to be such a person, as he has thought fit to render him, it was doubtless incumbent on the Govern∣or to except against him, when first presented by the House, in that station, or had he suspected either
<PB N="91" REF="034421_0091_0FFD9E98D80060F0"/>
the Speaker, or any other Member, to be disaf∣fected to the King, it might be no less expected, that he should have recommended to the House, the further qualification of the <HI>abjuration,</HI> as a test to them: but, if the Speaker of the House of Representatives of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and others acting in the great trusts, are to be rendered to the ministry, or to any board, as persons so no∣toriously disaffectd, as the Governor's charges im∣ply, and this without the least proof offered here, though so importunately, and yet dutifully solicit∣ed, it will force all thinking persons on apprehen∣sions, that there is more intended by it, than can safely be acknowledged here, where things and persons are better known, than can possibly be at such a distance, as the other side of the ocean.</P>
<P>Having proceeded to such a length, on these two important subjects, we should now chuse to bring this <HI>representation</HI> to a period, but that the Governor's written answer to another message from the House exacts our notice; in which he is pleased to say, That he is given to understand, (for which he thinks fit to quote the language of former Assemblies, and some of the Council) that this House did not design to make laws, nor raise any money this session, but upon terms inconsist∣ent with the Governor's duty and safety to comply with. To which the justest reply we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> present, return, is, That this House came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ther with no other views, than to discharge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> duty, in all respects, to the best of their skill a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> power; and they have nothing to crave of the Governor, but what they firmly believe is not only his duty, but for his honour and safety, to grant them: they would willingly have proceed∣ed to enquire what further laws may be necessary for the well-being of the province, in general, the Governor having told us, in his speech, That, if
<PB N="92" REF="034421_0092_0FFD9E92B1B21390"/>
we should have any other bills to offer, that might be for the interest and tranquillity of the people, he should be ready to pass them, and promised himself, that he would make a return suitable to their circumstances, and the advantages they will receive by them: but, in his next written mes∣sage, he informed the House, "That he disa∣greed from both the Council and Assembly, in his opinion, upon a point of such importance to the security, as well as tranquillity of the people, that no bill of ours can be of more to us:" the pur∣port of which was, that he declared (in opposition to both Council and Assembly) that one of the last laws, he himself had passed, which most near∣ly affected us, was void, and this by construction only; we could not, therefore, find any encou∣ragement from the Governor's proposals to us, to think any other bill, we could offer, was worth the soliciting, and much less deserving, a further consideration.</P>
<P>To this we must not omit adding, That we find judgment was given against one <HI>Hugh Lowdon,</HI> at the court of common pleas, in September last, whereupon the said <HI>Hugh Lowdon,</HI> giving way to the greatest resentment and rage, vowed revenge, at the utmost hazards, against the aforesaid Speak∣er and Secretary (being two of the Justices of that court) and having furnished himself with pistols, way-laid them, at their doors, and meeting the Speaker, the same night, he presented at him a pistol loaden with bullets; although, by the over∣ruling hand of Providence, no further mischief ensued. As this attempt could not but raise a horror in the hearts of all good men, we find the said <HI>Lowdon</HI> was bound over to the court, now sit∣ting, and indictments were sound against him, for the same; at which the Governor, instead of pro∣tecting the Magistrates, in the discharge of their
<PB N="93" REF="034421_0093_0FFD9ECD664FE450"/>
trusts, has now thought fit to grant <HI>Noli Prosequi</HI>'s, in the said <HI>Lowdon</HI>'s favour, in the same manner he had formerly done, for one <HI>Francis Phillips</HI> (that scandal to his order) when indicted and pro∣secuted for notorious crimes, after all the neigh∣bouring clergy had disowned him. Which pro∣ceedings, as they rendered the administration con∣temptible, so we also justly fear they will encou∣rage ill-minded men to the same attempts, in hopes of the like favour.</P>
<P>But, to sum up the whole, we can truly say, we are extremely troubled, that we cannot enjoy the same happiness, that most of our neighbours respectively do, of seeing our Governor take such measures, as should, by an agreeable force, sway the people's inclinations, to render him easy, in all respects; which can be effected by no means so powerfully, as first rendering them easy, in the enjoyment of those privileges, which they have an undoubted right to: and we are but too well as∣sured, that the only cause of a failure herein, is the Governor's mistake, since the Proprietary's indisposition, in the choice of his advisers; who, whatever views they may, at present form, will, at length, be found the sole occasion of all the disappointments, that may fall to the Governor's portion; for, even, though acting by commission, immediately from the crown, he would have the same injured people to deal with.</P>

<P>Governor Gookin takes his last leave of the Assembly, being superseded by Sir William Keith.—Governor Keith's first speech to the Assembly, with their answer and his reply.—Governor and Assembly concerned at the great influx of foreigners.—Dr. Griffith Owen.—Address of the Governor and Assembly to the King.—Great harmony between the Governor and Assembly.—William Penn's death and character, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE>IT doth not appear that Governor <HI>Gookin</HI> made any reply to this representation; but that, in the first month, 1716-17, by a written message to the House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor Gookin takes his last leave of the Assem∣bly, &amp;c.</NOTE> he took his last leave of them, in full as∣surance, that he should soon be superseded; and, without making any further reflection on them, or their conduct, he recommended to their consi∣deration the charge of his returning to seek ano∣ther employment; declaring, that the uncertainty of his being provided for at home; the thoughts of what he had left, to serve the Proprietary and the province, and the disappointments he had met with, so filled his mind, that they would excuse his not saying any more.</P>
<P>The Assembly gave him two hundred pounds, on the occasion; and on the first of May next following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Gookin is superseded by Sir Wil∣liam Keith</NOTE> he was superseded by Sir <HI>William Keith;</HI> who, by summons, convened the Assembly, on the 19th day of the sixth month, 1717.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="034421_0095_0FFD9EB5AC094CD8"/>Sir <HI>William Keith</HI> was a man of popular address, and acquainted with the art of gaining the affec∣tion of the people; which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Willi∣am Keith was a man of popular address, &amp;c.</NOTE> after so much alterca∣tion and tedious dispute between the Assembly and the two preceding Governors, <HI>Evans</HI> and <HI>Gookin,</HI> had so much the more effect, and rendered his ad∣ministration both the more acceptable and useful to the province. The following was his first speech to the Assembly, on the twentiety day of the sixth month, August, O. S.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Assembly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Being informed, upon my arrival here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith's first speech to the Assem∣bly.</NOTE> that the season of harvest, then at hand, could not well permit you to meet me, in your representative capacity, until that busy time be over; I did, out of a tender regard for your interests, then delay the satisfaction I still proposed to myself, in meet∣ing with this present Assembly; and I will always endeavour to make the time, you must necessarily bestow on the public service, as easy and pleasant to yourselves as, I hope, it will be profitable and satisfactory to the country in general.</P>
<P>If an affectionate desire, to oblige and serve the people of this province, can qualify me, in their good opinions, for the station wherein I am now placed, I may then expect that the country's and the Governor's interest will be effectually esta∣blished upon one bottom, as that he, who truly wishes well to either, cannot but find himself en∣gaged to serve both; and you yourselves may easily infer the warmth of my inclinations towards the service and prosperity of this country.</P>
<P>First, From the expensive application, last year, by which I carefully introduced to his royal highness, the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> then Regent, the humble address of the Assembly to the King, in
<PB N="96" REF="034421_0096_0FFEA87D5B46B250"/>
such manner, as freely to obtain his royal high∣ness's most gracious assurance, that the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> were a body of loyal subjects, for whom the King had great regard; and that his highness was sorry the King was not then present to receive so good an address; but that the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> might, at all times, depend on his highness's good-will, to serve them, in any thing, they had to ask of his royal father.</P>
<P>Then, the diligence, wherewith I obtained, at a considerable charge, the commission of Go∣vernor, without any other certain prospect, or advantage, but only that I should be thereby enabled more effectually to serve you.</P>
<P>And, lastly, by the great fatigue I have un∣dergone, since my arrival here, that no opportu∣nity might be slipped, to encourage virtue, and promote the general good of your country; but these considerations are trifles, compared with the indispensible obligation, that is of necessity upon you, to support the dignity and authority of this government, by such a reasonable and discreet establishment, as the nature of the thing, and your own generosity will direct.</P>
<P>And whatsoever you shall think sit to do, in that kind, pray let it no longer bear the undeserved and reproachful name of a burden upon the peo∣ple; but rather let your Governor be enabled to relieve the country from real burdens, by putting it in his power to direct a better oeconomy, and more frugal management of such taxes, as would answer the uses, for which they are intended, if not squandered by the bare-faced partiality and un∣profitable expense of the officers appointed to assess and collect the same.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I doubt not, but you will take the first opportunity, under a new administration, to examine the state of your laws, in order to
<PB N="97" REF="034421_0097_0FFD9F369C547CB8"/>
revive some, that are obsolete, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expired; and to make such alterations and additions, as shall be found necessary, for perfecting the constitution, and good order of government, in this province.</P>
<P>For that end, I am, on my part, ready to concur with you, in every thing, which you can possibly desire, or expect, from a Governor, who conscientiously intends to observe, and steadily resolves to pursue the duty of his office.</P>

<P>On the twenty-second, the Assembly presented him the following address, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We gladly embrace this first opportunity to congratulate the Governor's happy and safe arri∣val to us, with an eye to that good Providence, which preserved him and his family from pirates; who, at that time, much infested our coast; some of whom (as we are informed) waited with hopes of his falling into their hands.</P>
<P>This House, maturely considering the Go∣vernor's speech, find themselves obliged, in duty, to make grateful acknowledgments, for the Go∣vernor's tender regards to the interest of the pub∣lic.</P>
<P>The Governor's affectionate desire, to oblige and serve the people of this province, doth, and shall, meet with dutiful returns, in all matters, that come before us; and this House will contri∣bute all, in their power, to preserve the interest of the Governor and people upon one bottom.</P>
<P>And as we must acknowledge the people of this province to stand highly obliged to the Go∣vernor's application and care, in presenting to the
<PB N="98" REF="034421_0098_0FFEA870B3C14480"/>
Prince, then Regent, the humble address of the Assembly of this province, so we gladly take this occasion to confess the warmth of our hearts, in loyalty, duty and affection to the King, and roy∣al family, and entreat the Governor, upon all oc∣casions, so to represent us.</P>
<P>We cannot but express the pleasure, and great satisfaction of this House, in that the Pro∣prietary hath been pleased to place, and his Ma∣jesty to approve of, so worthy a gentleman, in commission over us; and hope our behaviour, and that of all the people of this province, will always be such as may preserve the good inclinations of the Governor to serve the country; an instance whereof we have in the fatiguing journeys he hath taken, in the late hot season, to promote the good of those under his government.</P>
<P>As the Governor was pleased to defer calling us, for the sake of harvest, so we crave leave to observe to him, that seed time being just at hand, it will be a great inconveniency to many of the Members to stay long at this season, so that we do not undertake, at this sitting, to enter upon an examination of our laws, or any business that will require length of time, but, depend upon the Governor's resolves and good intentions to oblige the people, by concurring with any thing, they can reasonably desire, for their service.</P>
<P>We, on our part, being fully satisfied, in our duty of supporting, as far as in us lies, the dignity and authority of this government, have at this time voted, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that the sum of <HI>five hundred pounds</HI> shall be given to the Go∣vernor, and paid out of the first public money, that shall arise, by any means, in the treasury; and to make it more certain, are now preparing a bill, which will be offered to the Governor, for augmenting the public stock.</P>

<P>I received a very affectionate address from your House; for which I heartily thank you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith's rep∣ly.</NOTE> and the generous acknowledgment, you have been pleased to make of my late endeavours to serve this country, cannot but greatly encourage me diligently to carry on the same public service, in all its parts.</P>
<P>Your dutiful expressions of loyalty and affec∣tion to the King and royal family, shall be care∣fully represented by me to his Majesty, and his servants, in the ministry; and while the spirit of unanimity, and so amiable a temper, with respect to government, is continued and preserved amongst you, I will take upon me to say, that you may be firmly assured of the King's favourable counte∣nance, and gracious condescension, in all our ap∣plications to the throne.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, since you have observed to me, that it will be inconvenient for you to enter upon any business now, which may detain you from your urgent affairs, at this time, in the country, I cannot but condescend that you may make such an adjournment, as you think will best suit with the season of the year; for I shall still have a great regard to the opinion, as well as the advantage and ease, of so good an Assembly.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Most gracious Sovereign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects and servants, being filled with a dutiful and just sense of that tender care and concern, which your Majesty has, on every occasion, been pleased to express, for the peace and prosperity of all your people, do, with profound humility and submission, presume to address your sacred Majesty, in behalf of your Majesty's good subjects, the people of this province, whom we have the ho∣nour, at this time, to represent, in a legislative capacity.</P>
<P>May it, therefore, please your Majesty to know, that, in the year 1681, this colony was settled by a considerable number of <HI>English</HI> sub∣jects, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> under the care, encourage∣ment and direction of <HI>William Penn,</HI> Esquire, our Proprietary and Governor in Chief.</P>
<P>That the persecution, which, in those days, prevailed against Protestant dissenters, in <HI>England,</HI> was the principal motive and reason, why the first
<PB N="102" REF="034421_0102_0FFEA88EE0471F60"/>
settlers of this country removed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> estates and families hither, where they might quietly and peaceably enjoy that innocent liberty of conscience, which they conceived to be every man's natural right.</P>
<P>That, by the unwearied application, industry and expense of the inhabitants, this colony is now increased to a considerable body of people, whereof the majority continue to remain in the society of <HI>Friends,</HI> called <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>That, such being the peculiar and distinguish∣ing circumstance of this, from any other colony, under his Majesty's dominions, in <HI>America,</HI> the offices of government must, of necessity, be sup∣plied, and the powers executed, by those of the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s persuasion, intermixed with such others, as are to be found here, in the communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and good Protestant subjects, well affected to your Majesty, and your govern∣ment.</P>
<P>That the happy influence of your Majesty's most equal and just administration, every where, has perfectly united our hearts and minds to con∣tribute our utmost endeavours, for carrying on the business of the government of this province, in such manner, as may be most agreeable and ac∣ceptable to your Majesty, and your ministry, at home.</P>
<P>That, for this end we have laboured, more generally of late, to regulate the proceedings, in our courts of judicature, as near as possibly could be done, to the constitution and practice of the laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That, from many years experience, we are not only convinced that the <HI>solemn affirmation</HI> al∣lowed in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to the people called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> doth, in all respects, and in every case, here,
<PB N="103" REF="034421_0103_0FFD9F5A43CAFE38"/>
answer the legal and essential purposes of an <HI>oath,</HI> but also the growing condition of this colony, which brings great numbers of people yearly from <HI>Europe,</HI> to reside among us.</P>
<P>The multitude of pirates abroad, and other loose vagrant people, who are daily crowding in, to shelter themselves under the peaceable admini∣stration of this government; and the absolute ne∣cessity there is to punish such, as shall dare to op∣pose, and break through, the known laws of society and humanity, lays us under the greatest obligations, with security to our lives, as well as the just maintenance of your Majesty's royal au∣thority over us, not to reject or despise, the <HI>solemn affirmation,</HI> allowed to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> without which, we humbly beg leave to assure your Ma∣jesty, judges, juries, nor evidences, sufficient, could never yet be found here, in the most crimi∣nal and notorious cases.</P>
<P>That formerly, it having been found imprac∣ticable to keep and preserve the public peace, within this government, any other way, than by admitting the <HI>solemn affirmation,</HI> in all cases what∣soever, to have the same force and effect in law, as an oath, upon a representation thereof to the <HI>board of trade,</HI> the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> by an order, in council, dated the 21st of January, 1702-3, was pleased to direct, in the alternative, <HI>viz.</HI> "That all persons, acting in any judicial, or other, offices, within this province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and three lower counties upon <HI>Delaware,</HI> should be obliged to take an <HI>oath,</HI> or, in lieu thereof, the <HI>solemn affirmation</HI> allowed, in <HI>England,</HI> to the peo∣ple called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and that, in all their public and judicial proceedings, the said judges and offi∣cers shall be obliged to administer the oaths, ap∣pointed by law, or the said attestation.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="034421_0104_0FFEA85DC8162508"/>That the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in general, having ap∣proved themselves to be an industrious and quiet people, most heartily attached to your Majesty's royal person and government, your loyal subjects of that persuasion, in this province, do humbly hope that your Majesty will vouchsafe to indulge their tender consciences, in the case of oaths, with the same freedom, that has been granted to them by your royal predecessors, and thereby we shall be effectually enabled to perform our respective duties, in preserving your Majesty's peace, within the ju∣risdiction of this province, and to enforce the just regard and obedience, due unto your royal autho∣rity, as becomes, may it please your Majesty, your Majesty's most loyal, most faithful, and most obe∣dient subjects and servants.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This affair of the <HI>solemn affirmation</HI> of the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> appears not to have been finally settled, or fixed, to the satisfaction of the province, and ac∣cording to that right, which the inhabitants of it thought themselves justly entitled to, till the year 1725; which will be mentioned hereafter in its proper place.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of this session, near the ap∣proach of harvest, Governor <HI>Keith,</HI> in his speech to this Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor praises the Assembly, &amp;c.</NOTE> highly complimented them, on account of the valuable and wholesome laws, "which (says he) were composed with so much care, by your diligent application, and the great temper, and perfect unanimity, wherewith the public affairs had been carried on, through all the parts of the administration of the government, for the last twelve months; which, he further de∣clared, must, by that time, have convinced all reasonable men, among them, of the many and great advantages, that such a harmony secures to the commonwealth; at the same time assuring them of his fixed resolution, according to the ut∣most
<PB N="105" REF="034421_0105_0FFD9EFA41A43250"/>
of his capacity, to act, in every respect, for the general good and interest of the province.</P>
<P>On the 30th day of the 5th month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Penn's death, &amp;c.</NOTE> (July) 1718, at <HI>Rushcomb,</HI> near <HI>Twyford,</HI> in <HI>Bucking∣hamshire,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> died the truly honourable Proprietary and Founder of the province of <HI>Penn∣sylvania, William Penn,</HI> aged about seventy-four years. He had, in the year 1712, as before men∣tioned, been seized with some fits of the apoplec∣tic kind; which, for the last six years of his life, had so affected his mental faculties, especially his memory, as to render him, in great measure, in∣capable of public business; which, with the gra∣dual decline of his strength of body, continued to increase, till the last period of his days: during which time, nevertheless, he is said to have been mostly sensible, intelligent, and, by his behaviour and expressions, at different times, to those, who were present with him, manifested, that he re∣tained, till his death, the happy enjoyment of that divine and mental felicity, which resulted from the nature of his religion, and manner of life.</P>
<P>Much of his character may be seen in the pre∣ceding sketch of his life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his cha∣racter, &amp;c.</NOTE> and in this Historical Account of <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI> a life of universal be∣nevolence, and good actions, to mankind, in ge∣neral, both in a religious and civil capacity. But the most lasting memorial of his great utility to the human race is his literary works, first printed in two folio volumes, and his flourishing and hap∣py province of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> The former being instructive, in the paths of virtue, and true feli∣city, to future generations; and the latter, an ex∣cellent example, for surrounding countries, and succeeding ages, to imitate, of the happy effects of a wise and generous plan of liberty, and a pru∣dent religious toleration, among a virtuous people.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="034421_0106_0FFEA89064B49B40"/>As to himself, I find expressed of him, by those, who had the best opportunity of being acquainted with his true character and real merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular properties.</NOTE> That he was a person endowed with great penetration and forethought; and a most sincere lover of truth and sincerity (which, in no small degree, is also manifest from the short sketch of his life and trans∣actions, given in the preceding part of this work). He had great natural abilities, and much acquired knowledge; which he ever rendered subservient to the great interests of religion and virtue. He was chaste and circumspect, yet pleasant in con∣versation; and of an engaging and obliging dis∣position and behaviour. He exhibited to the world a bright and amiable example, wherein the most excellent qualities of the accomplished gen∣tleman, and real Christian united; and, in diffe∣rent countries, ranks and conditions of men, ap∣peared a shining instance, that piety and virtue are not incompatible with a fine understanding.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious benefit.</NOTE>Besides, being divinely qualified, he was a very able and excellent instrument, in the hand of divine Providence, in removing much of that superstitious bigotry and ignorance, which, for ages, had overspread, and, even, till his time, remained, in a very remarkable manner, to cover the minds of all ranks of people; and, by intro∣ducing, in their stead, especially among the higher class of men, a more liberal, and rational, way of thinking, on religious subjects; and in what relates to the best improvement of the human mind, and its truest, and most lasting interest.</P>
<P>Moreover, actuated by the same principles, and induced by the same motives, of universal bene∣volence and improvement, in the condition of the human race, he has, in the much admired, and long conspicuous effects of his civil polity and go∣vernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ility.</NOTE> eminently exemplified to the world,
<PB N="107" REF="034421_0107_0FFD9F7C154EFC90"/>
how happy it is possible for mankind to live here, on earth, if the fault is not their own; a glorious example, and worthy of all imitation! wherein it is most manifest, that, contrary to the common course of human affairs, war, violence and injus∣tice have, in an extraordinary manner, given way to the happy and glorious means of peace, and of Christian perseverence in patience, equity and be∣neficence to mankind; insomuch, that if the fable of the <HI>golden age</HI> was ever verified, or a <HI>paradisical state</HI> introduced on earth, in reality, it has been universally acknowledged, they must have borne the nearest resemblance to that of <HI>Pennsylvania!</HI></P>
<P>In his printed works themselves are exhibited the manner of his writing and the nature of his compositions: his style is free and sweet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed works.</NOTE> yet strong and nervous; without affectation, and not laboured with a tedious formality of expression; which before had been so customary and fashiona∣ble, in the nation; but his periods are generally short, yet full, flowing and agreeable, that he in∣sensibly gains upon his reader; and while he allures his attention, he adds profit to delight: but orna∣ment of speech was the least part of his study; the grand objects of his concern were the nature and importance of his subjects; which, though some of them respected particular times, persons and things, were generally the most interesting, that could possibly employ the attention of the human mind.</P>
<P>Should any persons be disposed to censure him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of William Penn's go∣vernment.</NOTE> on account of some of his Lieutenant Governors, or, the want of still further advantages, which, they may apprehend, were in his power to have granted the province, it may be observed, That it is not so much the possession, as the proper use, of any thing valuable, which renders people happy; and the perversion thereof causes their mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery;

that the state and condition of human nature is such, as will only bear what may be called blessings to a certain degree; beyond which they become the contrary:
<Q><L>"Est modus in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obus; sunt certi denique fines;</L>

<BIBL><HI>Hor.</HI></BIBL></Q>
In forming a proper judgment of this nature, the considerations, on both sides of the question, ought to have due weight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proportion∣ate power and means necessary for actions.</NOTE><HI>First,</HI> Not only what may be desirable and use∣ful for the governed, but also the power, and pro∣per requisites of government itself, ought to be duly considered; for no valuable effect can reason∣ably be expected, without the possession and preserv∣ation of suitable power, ability and means, in the ef∣ficient, to perform it: these, in a limited proprietary under the crown, with the terms and obligations, upon which they were held of superior power, ought, in forming a just estimate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His actions great, com∣pared with the means, &amp;c.</NOTE> in this case, to be com∣pared with the valuable and happy effects, which were really experienced, in consequence of the pow∣er and authority, with which he was, in this restricted capacity, invested: for there is great and sufficient reason to suppose, that, had he, contrary to what he actually did, pursued a conduct, agreeable to the partial interest of some, or the contracted minds of others; or, had he acted from views of that impracticable equality, or ungovernable liberty, which the Eutopian imaginations of some shallow projectors, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash schemers, might endeavour to promote, who, by attempting too much, lose all, many would never have so happily experienced, nor the world have seen, the glorious effects of his excellent management, for so long a space of time.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="034421_0109_0FFD7A082136CAD8"/><HI>Secondly,</HI> In forming such a decision, the cla∣mours of some of the Assemblies ought not to be the sole criterion, to judge by;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clamours of some of the Assemblies against Wil∣liam Penn, mistaken, &amp;c.</NOTE> parti∣cularly, in their contending for more power than, it is most manifest, was ever intended them, or, from the best rational principles, judged to be for their real benefit; clamours, in great measure, either groundless, mistaken, or magnified, for particular purposes; and of dangerous, or, at least, of uncertain consequence, both to the Pro∣prietary and themselves; and probably impossible for him safely to comply with: for it is most certain, that it was not always in his power to do as he pleased; and his ever being a friend to rational, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue, liberty, was never questioned; but he very well knew, that power, unduly proportion∣ed, in the different parts of government, weakens its force▪ frustrates its design, and, without pru∣dence, judgment and unanimity, soon destroys its own existence.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> A just and proper estimate and com∣parison should be made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great∣ness of his actions to be compar∣ed with his means and ability, &amp;c.</NOTE> not only of the restricted power, and over-ruled authority of the Proprie∣tary, but also of the smallness of his fortune, or the narrowness of his circumstances, with the great∣ness of his actions; his long and assiduous labour and attention, his great expense and patience, both in effecting and preserving what he effected, in regard to the province, as originating in a just debt, due to his father, ought not only to have due place, in such an account, but also the nu∣merous and various acts of both public and pri∣vate beneficence, should be truly estimated; in which, it is most certain, he was continually, and in an extraordinary manner, engaged for the gene∣ral and particular good of mankind, in <HI>Europe,</HI> be∣sides his founding the province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and effectually providing for such advantage, freedom

and prosperity of its inhabitants, as no other per∣son, that we know of, had done for any country; with the nature and deficiency of his returns from thence;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be noted, that the great expense and trouble, which the province cost William Penn, and for which himself never received at equivalent, have, since his death, been amply rewarded to his family, or heir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by a very great increase of the income from thence, to his chil∣dren and posterity.</NOTE> which, instead of producing him a real benefit, proportionate, or similar, to what he had done for that province, afford no small argument in his favour, and as little honour to such as may be most disposed to cavil, in this respect, that, in the latter part of his life, when, it might reasonably be thought he ought to have reaped dif∣ferent fruits from that department of his labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See his let∣ter to the Assembly, anno 1710.</NOTE> he should have any real occasion to say, or la∣ment, as he did, that those, which he received from thence, were actually the <HI>cause of grief, trouble and poverty!</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of William Penn's ob∣stacles to further be∣neficence, &amp;c.</NOTE> Moreover, how much he stood on his terms with the different interests at court, is a circumstance of no small moment; with the changes in the government, at that time, in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> especially at the revolution: for there, it is manifest, as well as elsewhere, he was not with∣out adversaries; and those not the least powerful and dangerous. Likewise the difficulties, conse∣quent on a vast expense, was another obstacle in his way to further good service, and his wonted libe∣rality; in which it is well known his great gene∣rosity, in settling and encouraging the colony, had, in a particular manner, involved him, to the great reduction of his private estate, so liberally, and most evidently spent for a more public and general benefit; but, it is to be regretted, that the ingratitude of some people is too liable to mis∣construe, slight, or undervalue, the kindest bene∣ficence, though, in its consequences, to them∣selves very considerable, while they think any more may be had. Besides, the embarrassment of his
<PB N="111" REF="034421_0111_0FFD9ED4E081CED0"/>
private affairs, in which, during the latter part of his time, an ungrateful agent is said to have in∣volved him, was another great disappointment, and heavy incumbrance, with which he had to struggle; and which rendered the preserving of the province▪ for his posterity, still more difficult; but, in some of these cases, his great interest among his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> is said to have been of singular service to him.</P>
<P>As to what few small irregularities and defici∣encies, really existed in the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His absence mostly the cause of what was really amiss in the pro∣vince.</NOTE> or ma∣nagement of the province, unmagnified by his adversaries, or mistaken friends, which, at any time, wanted proper redress, or assistance, they were principally owing to his absence from it; which, it is certain, was very much against his mind, and chiefly occasioned by the necessity of his circumstances, the unsettledness of the go∣vernment in <HI>England,</HI> together with the attempts of his enemies, and his great beneficence to his province, with his small and discouraging returns from thence.</P>
<P>From these and similar considerations, it will be easy to perceive the nature of some of his dif∣ficulties, and the obstructions to such further pub∣lic service, as might have been desired, in a per∣son of his disposition, rank and station; which may account for part, at least, of the exceptionable conduct of some of his Deputy Governors; for whose office it was no easy matter to procure pro∣per, and, in every respect, suitable persons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suitable de∣puty Go∣vernors not easily to be had, &amp;c.</NOTE> as appears in the resignation of <HI>Thomas Lloyd;</HI> and, in his more than once, even, offering to the As∣sembly themselves the choice of naming the De∣puty Governor, or his Representative, during his absence! a very remarkable condescension! which Governors, though so much blamed, and doubt∣less

<P>Gentlemen, my duty to the crown unques∣tionably obliges me, while in this station, at all times, to use my utmost diligence, in preserving the good order and peace of the government, and to keep the King's subjects of this colony, firm in their allegiance, and dutiful obedience, to his most excellent Majesty, and our Sovereign Lord King <HI>George;</HI> to the end, therefore, that this may be done, with the greatest cheerfulness and unanimity, and likewise, that all due respect might be paid to <HI>Mr. Penn,</HI> and every other branch of the late Proprietary's family, I must desire that you will assist me with your opinions and advice; which, I doubt not, will have the same weight with all parties concerned in <HI>Britain,</HI> as you may be assured, it will ever have with me.</P>

<HEAD>To the honourable <HI>WILLIAM KEITH,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieute∣nant Governor of the province of Pennsylvania,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly's answer to the Go∣vernor's speech.</NOTE> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The address of the representatives of the free∣men of the said province, in Assembly met, in answer to his speech of the seventh instant.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The memory of the honourable <HI>William Penn,</HI> our late Proprietary and Governor in Chief, be∣ing dear to us, we cannot but have a just and due regard to his family, and should account it our happiness to be governed by a branch there∣of, under the most auspicious reign of our royal Sovereign, King <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>And since the Governor has been pleased to shew so great a regard to the advice of the repre∣sentative body of the freemen of this province, as to consult them, in a matter, which so highly concerns them, we must acknowledge is a great condescension, and an additional instance of his known affection to this colony, with kind incli∣nations to preserve the public peace and weal of this government.</P>
<P>The contents of those instruments and writings, which the Governor was pleased to lay before this House, brought us under a very deep concern, how to assist him with advice, suitable to the pre∣sent emergency; for we find the first part of the Proprietary's <HI>will</HI> seems to vest a trust in the no∣ble lords, there named, in order to accomplish the treaty of surrender of this government to the crown, which was begun by our late Proprie∣tary.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="034421_0123_0FFD9EFEB930A7D0"/>And though that trust may occasion various opinions in law and equity, yet that does not so much affect us, as the want of ascertaining the terms, which we have been always given to expect would accompany the surrender, in favour of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who embarked with the said Proprietary, in the laudable design of this considerable addition of the <HI>British</HI> empire; and, therefore, think it our duty, at this juncture, to claim those rights and favours, which have been promised us.</P>
<P>The Governor well knows that the present administration of this government, since the Pro∣prietary's decease, is supported by a law, confirmed by her late Majesty, Queen <HI>Anne;</HI> and by virtue thereof, is to continue till further order from the King, or the heirs of the said late Proprietary and Governor; and notwithstanding the great regard, the Governor has to the commission, sent him by the said Proprietary's heir at law, yet since that heir seems not, by the aforesaid <HI>will,</HI> invested with the powers of government; but the devise thereof, made to the said <HI>Lords,</HI> being allowed by his own council to be good; and since it doth not appear that commission is attended with the necessary re∣quisites, directed by acts of parliament, for quali∣fications of persons concerned in such stations, and security of plantation-trade, we conceive it will contribute to the peace of this government, and be safe for the Governor, that he, for the present, forbear to publish the said commission; and hope there will be no just occasion given, if the Go∣vernor should wave superseding the powers given him by the said heir at law, until he receive the pleasure of the said trustees, or has the Lord Chan∣cellor's decree, for his direction; the rather, be∣cause we understand that an amicable suit is depend∣ing in <HI>chancery</HI> betwixt the executrix, and heir at law, in order to settle both their claims to this go∣vernment.
<PB N="124" REF="034421_0124_0FFEA8CD9C77CBC8"/>
We heartily join with the Governor in his good resolutions, to preserve the good order and peace of the government, and loyalty of his Majesty's subjects, in this colony.</P>
<P>As touching the attack lately made upon our neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> we hope the Governor hath already taken proper measures in that affair, to∣wards quieting their minds, and will use his utmost endeavours to prevent such incursions upon them, for the future, by due representations to the neigh∣bouring governments, and persuasions to our <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> not to give further provocations, but that they will fall in with more peaceable inclinations; as the same will contribute to their ease and safety, and obtain the friendship and protection of this government; and this House gives the Governor assurance, that the necessary charges thereof shall be provided for; and that it is their full purpose, to support the administration, to the best of their power.</P>

<P>Whether it was in consequence of the above mentioned <HI>amicable suit,</HI> which was then depend∣ing in <HI>chancery,</HI> between the heir at law, and the executrix,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The go∣vernment was after∣wards set∣tled in fa∣vour of the younger branch of the family &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Hannah Penn,</HI> or otherwise, the affair of the government appears to have been after∣wards settled in favour of the younger branch of the family: the different parties, in the mean time, mutually agreeing to unite in the necessary appoint∣ments and management of the government of the province, till the said suit, dispute, or agreement, should be determined, or decided: so that not only the province itself, which, by virtue of the late Proprietary's last <HI>will,</HI> was vested in his widow, and other trustees, for the use of her children by him, but also the government of it, afterwards

<P>Whereas complaint has been made, That <HI>courts of chancery,</HI> or <HI>equity,</HI> though absolutely necessary, in the administration of justice, for mitigating, in some cases, the rigour of the laws, whose judgments are tied down to fixed and unal∣terable rules, and for opening a way to the right and equity of a cause, for which the law cannot, in all cases, make a sufficient provision, have, notwithstanding, been too seldom regularly held, in this province, in such manner as the aggrieved<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Note.</HI> On the 10th of March, 1720, died <HI>Vincent Caldwell,</HI> of <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI> in <HI>Chester</HI> county, an eminent and highly esteemed preacher among the <HI>Quakers:</HI> he came to <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> in 1699, and retained a good character till his death.</P><P>In the next following year▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled <HI>William Baldwin,</HI> of <HI>Bucks</HI> county, an eminent preacher in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me <HI>religious society,</HI> and in great esteem both among them and others.</P></NOTE>

subjects might obtain the relief, which by such courts ought to be granted. And whereas, the representatives of the freemen of this province, taking the same into consideration, did, at their last meeting in Assembly, request me, that I would, with the assistance of the Council, open and hold such a court of equity, for this province: to the end, therefore, that his Majesty's good subjects may no longer labour under these incon∣veniencies, which are now complained of, I have thought fit, by and with the advice of the Coun∣cil, hereby to publish and declare, that with their assistance, I propose (God willing) to open and hold a <HI>court of chancery,</HI> or <HI>equity,</HI> for the pro∣vince of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> at the court house of <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> on Thursday, the 25th day of this in∣stant, August; from which date the said court will be, and remain, always open, for the relief of the subject, to hear and determine all such matters, arising within this province aforesaid, as are regularly cognizable before any <HI>court of chan∣cery,</HI> according to the laws and constitution of that part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> called <HI>England;</HI> and his Majesty's Judges of his supreme courts, and all other, whom it may concern, are required to take notice hereof, and to govern themselves ac∣cordingly.</P>

<P>"The Governor spoke to the <HI>Conestogoe Indians,</HI> as follows, viz.</P>
<P><HI>"My Brothers and Children,</HI></P>
<P>"So soon as you sent me word, that your near friends and relations, the Chiefs of the <HI>Five Na∣tions,</HI> were come to visit you, I made haste, and am come to see both you and them, and to assure all the <HI>Indians</HI> of the continuance of my love to them.</P>
<P>"Your old acquaintance and true friend, the great <HI>William Penn,</HI> was a wise man; and, there∣fore, he did not approve of wars, among the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> whom he loved; because it wasted and de∣stroyed their people; but always recommended peace to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as the surest way to make them rich and strong, by increasing their numbers.</P>
<P>"Some of you can very well remember since <HI>William Penn,</HI> and his friends, came first to settle among you, in this country: it is but a few years, and like as yesterday, to an old man; nevertheless, by following that great man's peaceable counsels, this government is now become wealthy and pow∣erful, in great numbers of people. And though many of our inhabitants are not accustomed to war, and dislike the practice of men killing one another; yet you cannot but know, I am able to bring seve∣ral thousands into the field, well armed, to defend both your people and ours, from being hurt by any enemy, that durst attempt to invade us.</P>
<P>"However, we do not forget that <HI>William Penn</HI> often told us, that the experience of old age, which is true wisdom, advises peace; and I say to
<PB N="131" REF="034421_0131_0FFD9F231CD45730"/>
you, that the wisest man is also the bravest man: for he safely depends on his wisdom; and there is no true courage without it.</P>
<P>"I have so great a love for you, my dear bro∣thers, who live under the protection of this go∣vernment, that I cannot suffer you to be hurt, no more than I would my own children. I am but just now returned from <HI>Virginia;</HI> where I wearied myself, in a long journey, both by land and water, only to make peace for you, my children, that you may safely hunt in the woods, without danger, from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the many <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> that are at peace with that government. But the Go∣vernor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> expects, that you will not hunt within the great mountains, on the other side of <HI>Potowmack</HI> river; being a small tract of land, which he keeps for the <HI>Virginia Indians,</HI> to hunt in: and he promises that his <HI>Indians</HI> shall not come any more on this side <HI>Potowmack,</HI> or behind the great mountains this way, to disturb your hunting. And this is the condition I have made for you; which I expect you will firmly keep, and not break it on any consideration whatsoever.</P>
<P>"I desire that what I have now said to you may be interpreted to the Chiefs of the Five Nations present: for as you are a part of them, they are, in like manner, one with us, as you yourselves are; and, therefore, our counsels must agree, and be made known to one another: for our hearts should be open, that we may perfectly see into one another's breasts. And that your friends may speak to me freely, tell them I am willing to for∣get the mistakes, which some of their young men were guilty of, amongst our people. I hope they will grow wiser with age, and hearken to the grave counsels of their old men; whose valour we esteem, because they are wise; but the rashness of their young men is altogether folly."</P>

<P>"Smith, the <HI>Ganawese Indian,</HI> Interpreter from the <HI>Mingoe</HI> language to the <HI>Delaware.</HI></P>
<P>"John Cartlidge, Esquire, and Mr. James le Tort, Interpreters from the <HI>Delaware</HI> into English.</P>
<P>"Ghesaont, in the name, and on the behalf of all the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> delivered himself, in speaking to the Governor, as follows:</P>
<P>"They were glad to see the Governor, and his Council at this place; for they had heard much of the Governor, in their towns, before they came from home; and now they find him to be what they had then heard of him, <HI>viz.</HI> their friend and brother, and the same as if <HI>William Penn</HI> were still amongst them.</P>
<P>"They assure the Governor and Council, that they had not forgot <HI>William Penn</HI>'s treaties with them; and that his advice to them was still fresh in their memories.</P>
<P>"Though they cannot write, yet they retain every thing, said in their councils, with all the nations they treat with; and preserve it as carefully in their memories, as if it was committed, in our method, to writing.</P>
<P>"They complain, that our traders, carrying goods and liquors up <HI>Susquehanna</HI> river, sometimes
<PB N="133" REF="034421_0133_0FFD9F6D0A58A6B0"/>
meet with their young people, going out to war, and treat them unkindly, not only refusing to give them a dram of their liquor, but use them with ill language and call them dogs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"They take this unkindly; because dogs have no sense, or understanding: whereas they are men, and think that their brothers should not compare them to such creatures.</P>
<P>"That some of our traders calling their young men by these names, the young men answered; "If they were dogs, they might act as such;" whereupon they seized a cag of liquor, and ran away with it."</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This seems to be told in their artful way, to excuse some small robberies, that had been com∣mitted by their young people.</P>
<P>"Then laying down a belt of wampum upon the table, he proceeded and said,</P>
<P>"That all their disorders arose from the use of rum, and strong spirits; which took away their sense and memory; that they had no such liquors among themselves; but were hurt with what we furnished them; and therefore desired that no more of that sort might be sent among them.</P>
<P>"He produced a bundle of dressed skins and said,</P>
<P>"That the <HI>Five Nations</HI> faithfully remember all their ancient treaties; and now desire that the chain of friendship, between them and us, may be made so strong, as that none of the links can ever be broken.</P>
<P>"Presents another bundle of raw skins, and observes,</P>
<P>"That a chain may contract rust with lying, and become weaker; wherefore, he desires it may
<PB N="134" REF="034421_0134_0FFEA8D766340398"/>
now be so well cleaned, as to remain brighter and stronger, than ever it was before.</P>
<P>"Presents another parcel of skins and says,</P>
<P>"That, as, in the firmament, all clouds and darkness are removed from the face of the sun, so they desire that all the misunderstandings may be fully done away; so that when they, who are now here, shall be dead and gone, their whole people, with their children and posterity, may en∣joy the clear sun-shine of friendship with us for ever; without any thing to interpose, or obscure it.</P>
<P>"Presents another bundle of skins, and says,</P>
<P>"That, looking upon the Governor, as if <HI>Wil∣liam Penn</HI> was present, they desire, that, in case any disorders should hereafter happen between their young people and ours, we would not be too hasty in resenting any such accident, until their council and ours can have some opportunity to treat amicably upon it; and so to adjust all mat∣ters, as that the friendship between us may still be inviolably preserved.</P>
<P>"Presents a small parcel of dressed skins, and desires,</P>
<P>"That we may now be together as one people; treating one another's children kindly and affec∣tionately, on all occasions.</P>
<P>"He proceeds and says,</P>
<P>"That they consider themselves, in this treaty, as the full plenipotentiaries and representatives of the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> and they look upon the Go∣vernor, as the great King of <HI>England</HI>'s represent∣ative: and, therefore, they expect that every thing now stipulated will be made absolutely firm and good, on both sides.</P>
<P>"Presents a bundle of bear skins, and says,</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="034421_0135_0FFD9F1E14090B28"/>"That having now made a firm league with us, as becomes our brothers, they complain that they get too little for their skins and furs, so as they cannot live by their hunting; they desire us, therefore, to take compassion on them, and con∣trive some way to help them, in that particular.</P>
<P>"Presenting a few furs, he speaks only as from himself, to acquaint the Governor,</P>
<P>"That the <HI>Five Nations</HI> having heard that the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> wanted to speak with them, he himself, with some of his company, intended to proceed to <HI>Virginia,</HI> but do not know the way, how to get safe thither.</P>
<P>"On the 8th of July, the Governor and his Council, at the House of <HI>John Cartlidge,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> near <HI>Conestogoe,</HI> having advised upon, and pre∣pared, a proper present, in return for that of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and in confirmation of his speech, ac∣cording to custom, in such cases, which consisted of a quantity of strowd match-coats, gun powder, lead, biscuit, pipes and tobacco, adjourned to <HI>Conestogoe</HI> the place of treaty."</P>
<P>"At a Council, held at <HI>Conestogoe,</HI> July 8th, 1721. P. M.</P>
<P>"Present, the same as before; with divers gentlemen attending the Governor, and the Chiefs of the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> being all seated in council, and the presents laid down before the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Governor spoke to them, by an interpreter, in these words:</P>
<P><HI>"My Friends and Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>"It is a great satisfaction to me, that I have this opportunity of speaking to the valiant and wise <HI>Five Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> whom you tell me, you are fully empowered to represent.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="034421_0136_0FFEA855EDDCBCE8"/>"I treat you, therefore, as if all these nations were here present; and you are to understand, what I now say, to be agreeable to the mind of our great Monarch, <HI>George,</HI> the King of <HI>England,</HI> who bends his care to establish peace amongst all the mighty nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> unto whom all the people, in these parts, are, as it were, but like one drop, out of a bucket, so that what is now transacted between us, must be laid up, as the words of the whole body of your people and our people, to be kept in perpetual remembrance.</P>
<P>"I am also glad to find that you remember what <HI>William Penn</HI> formerly said to you. He was a great and a good man: his own people loved him; he loved the <HI>Indians,</HI> and they also loved him. He was as their father; he would never suffer them to be wronged; neither would he let his people enter upon any lands, until he had first purchased them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> He was just, and therefore the Indians loved him.</P>
<P>"Though he is now removed from us; yet his children and people, following his example, will always take the same measures; so that his and our posterity will be as a long chain, of which he was the first link; and when one link ends, another succeeds, and then another; being all firmly bound together in one strong chain, to en∣dure for ever.</P>
<P>"He formerly knit the chain of friendship with you, as the chief of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> in these parts; and lest this chain should grow rusty, you now desire it may be scoured, and made strong, to bind us, as one people, together. We do assure you, it is, and has always been, bright on our side; and so we will ever keep it.</P>
<P>"As to your complaint of our traders, that they have treated some of your young men un∣kindly, I take that to be said only by way of ex∣cuse
<PB N="137" REF="034421_0137_0FFD9F02AB7B2250"/>
for the follies of your people, thereby en∣deavouring to persuade me, that they were pro∣voked to do what you very well know they did; but, as I told our own <HI>Indians,</HI> two days ago, I am willing to pass by all these things; you may therefore be assured, that our people shall not of∣fer any injury to yours; or, if I know that they do, they shall be severely punished for it. So you must, in like manner, strictly command your young men, that they do not offer any injury to ours. For when they pass through the utmost skirts of our inhabitants, where there are no people yet settled, but a few traders, they should be more careful of them, as having separated themselves from the body of their friends, purely to serve the <HI>Indians</HI> more commodiously with what they want.</P>
<P>"Nevertheless, if any little disorders should, at any time, hereafter arise, we will endeavour that it shall not break, or weaken, the chain of friendship between us: to which end, if any of your people take offence, you must, in that case, apply to me, or to our chiefs. And when we have any cause to complain, we shall, as you de∣sire, apply to your chiefs, by our friends, the <HI>Conestogoe Indians:</HI> but, on both sides, we must labour to prevent every thing of this kind, as much as we can.</P>
<P>"You complain, that our traders come into the path of your young men, going out to war, and thereby occasion disorders among them; I will, therefore, my friends and brothers, speak very plainly to you, on this head.</P>
<P>"Your young men come dawn <HI>Susquehanna</HI> river, and take their road through our <HI>Indian</HI> towns and settlements, and make a path between us and the people, against whom they go out to war. Now, you must know, that the path, this
<PB N="138" REF="034421_0138_0FFEA8D9E363C4C8"/>
way, leads them only to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are in alliance with the <HI>English;</HI> and first, to those, who are in a strict league of friendship with the Go∣vernor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> just as these, our friends and children, who are settled among us, are in league with me and our people.</P>
<P>"You cannot therefore make war upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> in league with <HI>Virginia,</HI> without weaken∣ing the chain with the <HI>English:</HI> for, as we would not suffer these, our friends and brothers of <HI>Co∣nestogoe,</HI> and upon the river, to be hurt by any persons, without considering it, as done to our∣selves; so the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> looks upon the injuries, done to his Indian brothers and friends, as if they were done to himself. And you very well know, that, though you are five different nations, yet you are but one people; so as that any wrong, done to one nation, is receiv∣ed as an injury, done you all.</P>
<P>"In the same manner, and much more so, it is with the <HI>English,</HI> who are all united under one great King, who has more people, in that one town, where he lives, than all the <HI>Indians,</HI> in <HI>North America,</HI> put together.</P>
<P>"You are in league with <HI>New York,</HI> as your ancient friends, and nearest neighbours; and you are in league with us, by treaties, often repeated, and by a chain, which you have now brightened. As, therefore, all the <HI>English</HI> are but one people, you are actually in league with all the <HI>English</HI> go∣vernments, and must equally preserve the peace with all, as with one government.</P>
<P>"You pleased me very much, when you told me, that you were going to treat with the Go∣vernor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Your nations formerly entered into a very firm league with that government; and, if you have suffered that chain to grow rusty, it is
<PB N="139" REF="034421_0139_0FFD9F1F95D7F310"/>
time to scour it; and the Five Nations have done very wisely to send you there for that purpose.</P>
<P>"I do assure you, the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> is a great and a good man; he loves the <HI>Indians,</HI> as his children, and so protects and defends them; for he is very strong, having many thousand Christian warriors under his command; whereby he is able to assist all those, who are in any league of friendship with him. Hasten, therefore, my friends, to brighten and strengthen the chain with that great man; for he desires it, and will receive you kindly. He is my great and good friend; I have been lately with him; and since you say, you are strangers, I will give you a letter to him, to inform him of what we have done, and of the good design of your visit to him, and this country.</P>
<P>"My friends and brothers, I told you two days ago, that we must open our breasts to each other; I shall, therefore, like your true friend, open mine yet further to you, for your good.</P>
<P>"You see that the <HI>English,</HI> from a very small people, at first, in these parts, are, by peace amongst themselves, become a very great people amongst you, far exceeding the number of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> we know of.</P>
<P>"But while we are at peace, the <HI>Indians</HI> con∣tinue to make war upon one another; and destroy each other, as if they intended that none of their people should be left alive; by which means you are, from a great people, become a very small people; and yet you will go on to destroy your∣selves.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Indians</HI> of the south, though they speak a different language, yet they are the same people, and inhabit the same land, with those of the north. We, therefore, cannot but wonder, how you, that are a wise people, should take delight in put∣ting
<PB N="140" REF="034421_0140_0FFEA882260AC500"/>
an end to your race: the <HI>English,</HI> being your true friends, labour to prevent this. We would have you strong, as a part of ourselves: for, as our strength is your strength, so we would have yours to be as our own.</P>
<P>"I have persuaded all my brethren, in these parts, to consider what is for their good; and not to go out any more to war; but your young men, as they come this way, endeavour to force them. And because they incline to follow the counsels of peace, and the good advice of their true friends, your people use them ill, and often prevail with them to go out, to their own destruction. Thus it was, that their town of <HI>Conestogoe</HI> lost their good King, not long ago; and thus many have been lost. Their young children are left without pa∣rents; their wives without husbands; the old men, contrary to the course of nature, mourn the death of their young; the people decay, and grow weak; we lose our dear friends, and are afflicted. And this is chiefly owing to your young men.</P>
<P>"Surely, you cannot propose to get either riches, or possessions, by going thus out to war: for when you kill a deer, you have the flesh to eat, and the skin to sell; but when you return from war, you bring nothing home, but the scalp of a dead man; who, perhaps, was husband to a kind wife, and father to tender children, who never wronged you; though, by losing him, you have robbed them of their help and protection; and, at the same time, got nothing by it.</P>
<P>"If I were not your friend, I would not take the trouble of saying all these things to you; which I desire may be fully related to all your people, when you return home, that they may consider in time, what is for their own good. And, after this, if any will be so madly deaf and blind, as neither to hear nor see the danger before them, but will
<PB N="141" REF="034421_0141_0FFD9EF8B8F52D40"/>
go out to destroy, and be destroyed, for nothing, I must desire that such foolish young men would take another path, and not pass this way, amongst our people, whose eyes I have opened; and they have wisely hearkened to my advice. So that I must tell you plainly, as I am their best friend, and this government is their protector, and as a father to them, we will not suffer them any more to go out, as they have done, to their destruction. I say again, we will not suffer it; for we have the counsel of wisdom amongst us, and know what is for their good. For though they are weak, yet they are our brethren; we will therefore take care of them, that they be not misled with ill counsel. You mourn when you lose a brother; we mourn, when any of them are lost; to prevent which they shall not be suffered to go out, as they have done, to be destroyed by war.</P>
<P>"My good friends and brothers, I give you the same counsel, and earnestly desire that you will follow it, since it will make you a happy people. I give you this advice, because I am your true friend; but I much fear you hearken to others, who never were, and never will be, your friends.</P>
<P>"You know very well, that the <HI>French</HI> have been your enemies, from the beginning; and though they made peace with you twenty-two years ago, yet, by subtle practices, they still endeavour to ensnare you. They use arts and tricks, and tell you lies, to deceive you; and if you would make use of your own eyes, and not be deluded by their jesuits and interpreters, you would see this your∣selves: for you know they have no goods of any value, these several years past, except what has been sent to them from the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>New York,</HI> and that is now all over. They give fair speeches, instead of real services; and as, for many years, they attempted to destroy you in war, so they now
<PB N="142" REF="034421_0142_0FFEA8DBB963C9A8"/>
endeavour to do it in peace; for when they per∣suade you to go out to war against others, it is only that you may be destroyed yourselves; which we, as your true friends, labour to prevent; be∣cause we would have your numbers increase, that you may grow strong, and that we may be all strengthened in friendship and peace together.</P>
<P>"As to what you have said of trade, I suppose the great distance, at which you live from us, has prevented all commerce between us and your peo∣ple. We believe those, who go into the woods, and spend all their time upon it, endeavour to make the best bargains they can, for themselves; so, on your part, you must take care to make the best bargains you can with them. But we hope our traders do not exact; for we think that a strowd coat, or a pound of powder, is now sold for no more buck skins than formerly. Beaver, indeed, is not, of late, so much used in <HI>Europe;</HI> and, therefore, does not give so good a price; and we deal but very little in that commodity. But deer skins sell very well among us; and I shall always take care that the <HI>Indians</HI> be not wronged. But, ex∣cept other measures be taken to regulate the <HI>Indian</HI> trade every where, the common method used in trade will still be followed; and every man must take care of himself; for thus I must do myself, when I buy any thing from our own people; if I do not give them their price, they will keep it; for we are a free people. But if you have any further proposals to make about these affairs, I am willing to hear and consider them; for it is my desire that the trade be well regulated to your content.</P>
<P>"I am sensible rum is very hurtful to the <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI> we have made laws, that none should be car∣ried amongst them; or, if any is, that it should be staved, and thrown upon the ground; and the
<PB N="143" REF="034421_0143_0FFF580BAB9AFAA8"/>
Indians have been ordered to destroy all the rum, that comes in their way, but they will not do it; they will have rum; and when we refuse it, they will travel to the neighbouring provinces and fetch it; their own women go to purchase it, and then sell it amongst their own people, at excessive rates. I would gladly make any laws to prevent this, that could be effectual; but the country is so wide, the woods are so dark and private, and so far out of my sight, if the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves do not prohi∣bit their own people, there is no other way to prevent it; for my part, I shall readily join in any measures, that can be proposed, for so good a purpose.</P>
<P>"I have now, my friends and brothers, said all, that I think can be of service, at this time, and I give you these things here laid before you, to confirm my words, <HI>viz.</HI> Five coats, twenty pounds of powder, forty pounds of lead, for each of the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> that is, twenty-five coats, one hundred pounds of powder, and two hundred pounds of lead, in the whole; which I desire may be delivered to them, with these words, in my name, and on behalf of this province: I shall be glad to see often some of your chief men, sent in the name of all the rest; and desire you will come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to visit our families, and our chil∣dren born there, where we can provide better for you, and make you more welcome; for people always receive their friends best at their own houses. I heartily wish you well on your journey, and good success in it. And when you return home, I desire you will give my very kind love, and the love of all our people, to your kings, and to all their people.</P>
<P>"Then the Governor rose from his chair; and when he had called <HI>Ghesaont,</HI> the speaker, to him,
<PB N="144" REF="034421_0144_0FFEA88660A43F38"/>
he took a corronation medal of the king, and pre∣sented it to the <HI>Indian</HI> in these words:</P>
<P>"That our children, when, we are dead, may not forget these things, but keep this treaty, be∣tween us, in perpetual remembrance, I here deli∣ver to you a picture, in gold, bearing the image of my great master, the King of all the <HI>English:</HI> and when you return home, I charge you to deli∣ver this piece into the hands of the first man, or greatest chief of all the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> whom you call <HI>Kannygooah,</HI> to be laid up and kept, as a token to our children's children; that an entire and last∣ing friendship is now established for ever, between the <HI>English,</HI> in this country, and the great Five Nations."</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF the Assembly, elected in October, 1721,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1721.</NOTE> <HI>Jeremiah Langhorne</HI> was Speaker; to which As∣sembly, in the winter, the Governor, in his speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith ex∣presses his concern and scheme for the public good.</NOTE> having intimated the necessity of their united and diligent application to restore the planter's credit, without discouraging the merchant, by whose in∣dustry alone, says he, <HI>"Their trade must be sup∣ported with a sufficient currency of cash,"</HI> thus fur∣ther expressed himself: "My mind is so fully bent upon doing this province some effectual service, that I have lately formed the design of a consider∣able
<PB N="146" REF="034421_0146_0FFD9F749E9E93C8"/>
settlement amongst you, in order to manu∣facture and consume the grain; for which there is, at this time, no profitable market abroad; and although this project will doubtless, at first, prove very chargeable and expensive to me, yet, if it meets with your approbation, and the good will of the people, I am well assured it cannot fail of answering my purpose, to do a real service to the country, and every interest and concern of mine shall ever be built on that bottom," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The house was highly pleased with the Govern∣or's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for the public good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦bly acknow∣ledge the Governor's regard, &amp;c.</NOTE> "His zeal to restore the planter's credit, with his just care of the merchant, who, of late, with others equally, had laid under the greatest disadvantages of want of a sufficient currency of cash, as appeared to them, from the melancholy complaints of the peo∣ple, declaring they would readily fall in with any scheme, that should appear to them conducive to a remedy." They gratefully acknowledged his patriotic design to manufacture and consume the grain of the country, and heartily thanked him for his good condescension, and repeated offers of advice and assistance, for the public utility.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings re∣specting the murder of an Indian.</NOTE>"In the spring of the year 1722, an <HI>Indian</HI> was barbarously killed, within the limits of the province, somewhere above <HI>Conestogoe.</HI> This mur∣der was supposed to be perpetrated by one or two<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Note. <HI>Anthony Morris</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> died on the 24th of October, 1721.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anthony Morris obiit.</NOTE> He came over among the settlers of <HI>West Jersey,</HI> about the year 1680, and fixed his residence at <HI>Burlington</HI> for several years.

persons, of the name of <HI>Cartlidge.</HI> The Govern∣or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1722.</NOTE> having commissioned <HI>James Logan,</HI> and Col. <HI>John French,</HI> two of his Council, to go to Cone∣stogoe, to enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e into the affair, after their return, at the request of the Assembly, laid their report of it before them. The House, in their address to the Governor thereon, expressed their utmost concern on this affair: they gratefully acknow∣ledged, and highly commended the Governor's prudent conduct, and steady administration of justice; but more especially at that time, on an occasion of the greatest importance to the peace and safety of the government, by his empowering two gentlemen of his Council so able and pru∣dent, on the present emergency; "Whose wise conduct (said they) is very conspicuous from their report laid before the House by the Governor;" "That, at the relation of the dismal circum∣stances, they were filled with horror and surprise, that, after so long continuance of the peace, first settled by the honourable Proprietary, <HI>William Penn,</HI> with the <HI>Indians,</HI> any breach should be now made by those, under the name of <HI>Christians,</HI> to the reproach of that name, and danger of the safety and peace, both of this province and others."</P>
<P>They earnestly requested the Governor to per∣sist in his laudable endeavour, to bring the ag∣gressors to condign punishment, with all possible speed, lest, by delay of justice, the <HI>Indians</HI> should be induced to withdraw their allegiance to the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and affection from this government, and be provoked to do themselves justice, in a manner, that might be of most dan∣gerous consequence: "That he would <HI>advise with his Council,</HI> in making treaties <HI>with them; for,</HI> (said they) <HI>as they are some of the principal inhabitants of this government,</HI> we have no reason

<P>They further pressed the maintaining the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eague of friendship, first made by their <HI>worthy Proprie∣tary,</HI> as a thing of the greatest importance, that could possibly come before them; and therefore, they unanimously recommended the execution of strict justice, as the best and most effectual means for that end; the want of which, in the appre∣hension of that vindictive people, had produced sad and fatal consequences to other provinces; they likewise proposed to the Governor's con∣sideration some particulars, to be immediately done, in the affair; and mentioned the repeated request of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that <HI>strong liquors</HI> should not be carried, nor sold, among them; with the petition of sundry inhabitants of the province, to the same import; which the laws hitherto made, in that case, had not been able to prevent; they, therefore, requested the advice and assistance of the Governor and Council therein, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked them for the great satis∣faction, which they expressed, with his conduct and administration; and declared, "That he had carefully endeavoured to follow the late <HI>honour∣able Proprietary's steps</HI> in such affairs; to keep the natives always in a lively and perfect remem∣brance of his love to them, and to build all their treaties of peace with them, upon the same prin∣ciples and maxims of good policy, which he used and maintained when he was here himself." He likewise assured the House, that he had, at that time, all the probability, which the nature of the
<PB N="149" REF="034421_0149_0FFD9F07C43FA198"/>
case would admit of, for settling matters again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Indian</HI> nations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that just, firm and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foundation, which the House so earnestly desired and recommended to him. He acknow∣ledged the insufficiency of the laws, to restrain people from carrying too great quantities of rum, and selling it among the <HI>Indians,</HI> thereby debauch∣ing and cheating them; which, he said, he had complained of to former Assemblies.</P>
<P>Great pains were taken, in this affair; an <HI>In∣dian</HI> messenger, <HI>Satcheecho,</HI> was dispatched to the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> the suspected persons were commit∣ted to prison; and the Governor, with two of the Council, met and treated with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> respecting it; besides the presents, which were made to the <HI>Indians.</HI> The Five Na∣tions desired that the <HI>Cartlidges</HI> should not suffer death; and the affair was, at length, amicably settled.</P>

his speech to this Assembly, on the first of the 11th month, having passed an encomium on the great harmony and unanimity, which had subsist∣ed between him and the former Assemblies, with the means, and happy consequences thereof, took occasion thence to recommend to them, among other things, that they would direct their enqui∣ry, to find out, from whence it proceeded, that such a multiplicity of expensive and vexatious law suits had been, of late, commenced in their courts, beyond what was usual, or known, in the province before.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Respecting the article of law suits, which the Governor mentioned to the House, the committee of grievances, on the same month, made their report, as follows, takes from the printed votes:</P><P>"We have examined the Sheriff's docquet, and find that,</P><P><TABLE>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣vernor's re∣marks on the increase of law suits, &amp;c.</NOTE>"Because, says he, if this sudden change should appear to arise only from the increase of trade and riches, it is well; but, if from any other cause whatsoever, I conceive it will be at∣tended with dangerous consequences to the body of the people, whom you represent; and, in such case, it will require your immediate applica∣tion." He also observed, "That, for the sake of the whole country, who must live by the pro∣duct and manufacture of grain, it was absolutely necessary, that the making good bread and flour,
<PB N="151" REF="034421_0151_0FFD9EDC6061B410"/>
be so regulated, as to recover their lost credit, in the market, in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> upon which their whole traffic entirely depended:" He concluded with expressions of the warmest zeal, to join with them in whatever means should be found neces∣sary to ease the present burdens of the people, and to relieve their complaints.</P>
<P>The House, in answer, as kindly acknowledged the Governor's care, and constant inclinations, for the good and prosperity of the province; and, joining with them, in sentiment, respecting the necessary things, which he recommended to their consideration, they undertook the regulation and improvement of some of the law proceedings; especially respecting attachments; and several laws were passed, for these purposes.</P>
<P>About this time the province appears to have been under great difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for a paper cur∣rency first introduced into Penn∣sylvania, 11th mo. 1722.</NOTE> respecting the de∣cay, or discouragement, of its trade and credit, and the want of a sufficient medium, or currency, of cash; for the relief of which divers proposals were made; and among the rest, that of <HI>paper money,</HI> or <HI>paper bills of credit,</HI> was now intro∣duced; which occasioned considerable debate, between men of different sentiments, respecting it.</P>
<P>The Governor was a strong advocate for a <HI>pa∣per currency,</HI> and took great pains to promote it; with whom appeared to join the generality of the people. But divers, who were considered as persons of most property, judgment and weight, in the province, did not like the scheme: but then their dislike was chiefly founded on the difficulty of preserving the said <HI>currency</HI> from <HI>depreciation;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in∣troduction of the paper currency.</NOTE> which they saw, had, in general, occasioned mis∣chievous and fraudulent consequences, in other provinces; together with some modes, which were proposed, of issuing and conducting the same; so that their opposition was not so much entirely

against a <HI>paper credit,</HI> properly guarded and con∣ducted, as against fraud, or those modes of form∣ing and managing it, which had been so ruinous in other places, or such as they judged would be equally pernicious, if adopted here. Hence, in the 11th month this year, when the scheme was under consideration of the Assembly, <HI>Isaac Nor∣ris</HI> and <HI>James Logan,</HI> in the name and behalf of several gentlemen and merchants, presented the following sentiments thereon, in writing, to the House, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the honourable House of <HI>Representatives</HI> of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A few days after this the following paper was laid before the House, in answer to these <HI>sentiments of several gentlemen and merchants,</HI> in relation to a <HI>paper currency,</HI> viz.</P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the honourable House of <HI>Representatives</HI> of the province of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> in Assembly met, the 24th of January, 1722-23.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the honourable House,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We beg leave to lay before you some considerations, in answer to the <HI>sentiments of several gentlemen and merchants,</HI> in relation to a <HI>paper cre∣dit</HI> which they were admitted to present, the tenth instant.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is but just to concede to their notion, that this province is dependent on, and derives all its powers from, <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that it is the highest wisdom, in our Legislature, to direct themselves by the same prudent measures, as far as our circumstances with theirs may agree.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is by them alledged, that when the nation was distressed by war, and their coin generally debased, yet the parliament would not advance their currency, on any account; and that they renewed it, at the same fineness, to pass at the former rates; and they have unaltera∣bly kept to the same. And further, that <HI>twelve hundred thousand pounds</HI> made good to private persons all their loss, received from exchanging their clipped and debased coin, for the new milled money, delivered at par: to which we say, that we know (by what authority soever it was, or is done) that since, if not then, the coin hath been (particularly the gold) often raised and lowered; and that the <HI>twelve hundred thousand pounds</HI> did make good all the loss in the kingdom, for the debased coin, is an assertion, we doubt not, but there are many, in <HI>Great Britain</HI> (and some here) can inform those gentlemen otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In concurrence with the sentiments of these gentlemen, in their third paragraph, we humbly recommend it to our legislators, that our bills be established upon so just a foundation, that, while in being, they may still continue of the same value with real money, according to the rates, at which they are first issued.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> If those bills cannot be procured, where they are to be issued, for a less pledge or security, than gold, or silver, would be, the easy terms of refunding them will not lessen their value; for the stamp of authority has its own laws, as unalterable in themselves, as those of interest, or increase, are in usury; and which, such as are versed in those affairs, as carefully consider.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The schemes most commonly talked of, for lending out sums to be discharged by annual payments, equal to, or not much exceed∣ing the interest, for a certain number of years, without paying any prin∣cipal, are not partial and unjust, nor destructive to the public credit; for the pledge secured is more than an equivalent to the sum received, and the interest given is not inconsiderable, even, of the lowest rated schemes. To whom are they partial and unjust, since no method is proposed, or contrived, for any particular man, or men, excluding others? The benefit is to be general; and though the necessities of the poor chiefly call for the succour, yet it is more within the compass of the rich to be thereby fa∣voured; because they have plenty of pledges: let them not, then, complain of partiality, or injustice, through their own negligence. How are such schemes destructive to public credit, since the public is capable of yield∣ing so much relief to a necessitous people, without hurting itself? No, the design is laudable, and greatly becomes our generous <HI>patriots.</HI> But, perhaps, there are some, that are partial to themselves, although they seem to speak in defence of the public, affording us room to guess, they would have no money borrowed, but of private persons, and begrudge the borrowers of the public, the gain of near <HI>thirty pounds,</HI> according to the exquisite calculation of those gentlemen; because they themselves know, that such an advantage is not equal to the sweet incomes of usury.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> All such projects are not exceedingly weak and unjust; for what man, had he money by him to lend, would refuse it, on sufficient security? And if he does lend it, on such security, where can we suppose the lender's loss to be? Or, wherein is the paper credit lessened, when there is more than its value to support it? Their supposing it to be lent to all, is an amusement; and the tribunal is easy to be erected, to find out persons of worth, from those that are worth nothing; and the poor (who, they say, have as little merit as any) may have a chance to get it by labour, by the employers having something to pay both to their own, and the poor man's advantage: and thus a way may easily be found for dispensing the public favours. We presume to add, to these great and rich men (and, therefore, according to their account, sober and industri∣ous men) that we humbly hope a medium, in business, will run us from the loose way of luxury, idleness and folly, which often, happens from be∣ing <HI>non-plus'd</HI> in a regular dispatch of affairs, for want of pay, when due.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> This currency, or paper money, will not fall in value, it raised on a good foundation, as recommended in the third article. The rise of silver is alone owing to the avarice of the possessor; who, know∣ing there is no other currency (and that too, at this time, extremely scarce) they have imposed on the necessities of the people, by advancing it near <HI>two shillings</HI> in the pound; but it is not improbable that our bills, being always capable of purchasing our country produce, their value be∣ing equal to silver, will again reduce it to its stated worth, and be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> satisfactory to the kind lender, who, (according to them) relieved the borrower in distress, or sold him land, or goods, at the real value, at the time of lending, or sale.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> Those do not deceive themselves, who, because gold and silver may be had, at <HI>New York,</HI> or other places, in exchange for their paper money, suppose that the one is as good as the other. It is a re∣ceived maxim, that the value of any thing is in proportion to what it will purchase: now paper bills will, at this time, and would formerly, purchase, in <HI>New York,</HI> goods cheaper than cash will, at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and it is obvious that some other reason may have occasioned the rise of silver and gold there; since we have here advanced, at least, <HI>six pence</HI> per ounce, on silver, beyond the rate ascertained by act of parliament, without any such motive as paper money.</P>
<P>These being premised on the general heads, what next follows is in answer to their three conclusive points.</P>
<P N="1">1st. If the whole sum struck be so small, that it will not answer the absolute and immediate necessities of those who have real securities to give, it will not (we humbly conceive) be sufficient to pass from hand to hand, for a currency.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That which is a benefit to any person, for five years, will be a further benefit, for a longer term; and, perhaps, the fixing it to a short date may abridge some persons from effecting what they might accom∣plish for their own good, and the country's advantage, in more time. The difficulty of exchanging worn out bills for new, in an office to be erected for that purpose, we doubt not the care and ability of this As∣sembly to surmount, and render practicable. And, if our laws can con∣tinue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation, yet we presume a law so beneficial to the subject here, so concurrent to the practice of neighbouring colonies, and no ways repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> will, when duly represented at home, not want that ap∣probation.</P>
<P N="3">3d. We confide in this, that the wisdom of this <HI>honourable House</HI> needs no direction, in the care to be taken, of sinking the <HI>paper currency</HI> in course, and in a just manner; for we esteem you (and not these gen∣tlemen petitioners) to be proper judges of the methods hitherto discours∣ed of.</P>
<P>These observations, may it please this honourable House, on the sentiments of those gentlemen, we humbly offer to your consideration, and pray your favourable construction.</P>
</LETTER><P>Soon after the preceding answer was delivered to the House, it was followed by a paper, in reply to it, containing, <HI>the further sentiments of the gentlemen, merchants,</HI> &amp;c. on the same subject, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the honourable House of <HI>Representatives</HI> of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further sentiments, &amp;c.</NOTE>In the important affair of a <HI>paper credit,</HI> now under the considera∣tion of your House, it is to be hoped that all honest men, amongst us, think of it from the same principles, and with the same inclinations, <HI>viz.</HI> to promote the true interest and reputation of this colony.</P>
<P>Upon these views alone we lately took the liberty to petition your honourable House, to be heard upon the subject, and the next day ex∣hibited our sentiments, in writing, drawn into several heads, and built, on such solid foundations of truth, that we are well assured they cannot be shaken.</P>
<P>Yet, as the opinions of men are extremely various, and great pains have, of late, been taken here, to instil and strengthen popular errors, on that subject; we find divers of these drawn up, in a paper, lately presented to, and received by, the House; containing, as it says, some considerations, in answer to our said sentiments, but truly consisting, in a great measure, of those common mistakes, which have unhappily oc∣casioned such differences in opinion, even, among the well-meaning, who, we presume, all aim at the public good.</P>
<P>The more clearly, therefore, to manifest these popular deceptions, to prevent the unhappy consequence, that may attend their obtaining further place, and more effectually to establish the truth and certainty of those heads, we before presented, we humbly beg leave to offer the fol∣lowing observations, on the several parts of that paper, with some <HI>fur∣ther sentiments,</HI> on the whole matter; which, we hope, will be inter∣preted according to their true intention, that is, to serve the public, in which we are all jointly embarked.</P>
<P>The design of what we then exhibited to the House (as is evident from all the parts of it) was not to oppose a <HI>paper credit,</HI> but to shew the danger of ill concerted schemes, and to point out, as far as was then proper, what we conceived to be the most effectual measures, for an∣swering all the just ends, proposed by such a credit.</P>
<P>In the three first articles was represented how much it became us, as a government depending on Britain, to copy after the great examples, their parliaments have set before us; particularly these two cases of keeping our coin constantly to the same rates, and supporting the credit of our bills, when issued, equivalent to such money.</P>
<P>To the first of these, those, concerned in that paper, are obliged to concede.</P>
<P>To the second they answer with a gross mistake, and an unbecom∣ing trifling: for, it is positively true, that since the great reformation of the <HI>English</HI> coin, in 1696, there has not been the least alteration in it; <HI>guineas,</HI> which, till lately, never were a legal tender, were limited that year, that they should not, under a penalty, be received at more than <HI>twenty-two shillings</HI> each. But no sooner did <HI>silver,</HI> the true lawful mo∣ney of the kingdom, circulate freely again, which, by the great dili∣gence of the several mints, they did, within six months after; but the people refused to take them at more than <HI>twenty-one shillings and six pence,</HI> as formerly; at which rate they have constantly continued, till the mines of <HI>America,</HI> especially of <HI>Brasil,</HI> producing much more gold than silver, in value, the first has fallen, in <HI>Europe;</HI> on which, to prevent the ex∣portation of silver, they are, by a late act of parliament, reduced to <HI>twenty-one shillings;</HI> and at that rate, at length, made a legal tender, that is, lawful money of the nation. If foreign gold, or silver, be meant, which are only merchandize, and rise, as the demand is for ex∣portation, these are entirely out of the question. To the other part, where they alledge, that the <HI>twelve hundred thousand pounds</HI> did not make good all the loss, in the kingdom; we say, that our informations are as good as any can pretend to, in this province.</P>
<P>That sum, on large trials, made in the exchequer, of the monies re∣ceived the year before, was judged sufficient to make good the whole loss; and all, who brought in their money, within the time limited, had it made good to them. It is true, some persons disaffected to the go∣vernment, and others fond of their hoards, forbore, and suffered accord∣ingly, but the great care of the parliament, and therefore the truth of our assertion, are from hence equally clear.</P>
<P>The third head, which is the greatest point, of keeping up our bills to the same value with real money, according to the rates, or which they are, at first, issued, is also conceded, in general terms; and the just foundation mentioned, is all that is contended for.</P>
<P>But what is advanced in the fourth and fifth articles, is the grand popular error, that endangers a disappointment, in that great end pro∣posed. For no stamp of authority can give an intrinsic worth, where it really is not. Experience, whose instructions, even the weakest may reach, will shew us, that bills of credit have been issued in no place on this continent, where they have not, sooner or later, sunk below the value, at which they were, at first, made; and yet they all had as pow∣erful a stamp of authority as any we can give. We are now upon put∣ting in practice a project of the same kind; it is, therefore, the more highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncumbent on us, prudently and advisedly to consider, in time, by what means the inconveniences, that have attended others, in theirs, may be prevented in our undertaking.</P>
<P>The first remark, we offered, on this head, was from this founda∣tion, that, if the public, by their terms of issuing their bills, shew they estimate them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less than they would real money; all mankind, but es∣pecially the trader, whose business it is to exchange his commodity for its real value, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> naturally be taught to do the same. The greatness of the security ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es no manner of difference, unless the borrower of the bills should be obliged, for <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> lent in them, to repay, upon that security, the like sum of gold or silver, and not in the same specie; for should one, upon lending any rarity, of no great intrinsic va∣lue, take a security of <HI>one hundred pounds,</HI> to have it returned, this would not add to the real worth of the thing lent, though it shewed, the len∣der resolved to have it restored to him; or, if a man should assign the bond of another person of dubious credit, for <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> due, for the consideration of <HI>fifty pounds</HI> only, to be paid by the assignee, in twelve months, to the assignor; and for the payment of the <HI>fifty pounds,</HI> should take a mortgage, or security, worth <HI>five hundred pounds,</HI> this in∣deed will make the debt of <HI>fifty</HI> more certainly good, but will not add one farthing to the value of the bond assigned, in the same manner, if a person be possessed of <HI>fifty pounds,</HI> in bills of credit, though there be a security of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two hundred pounds</HI> given for them, in the office, by the borrower, of the first taking of them out, should these bills, for the same reasons, that have prevailed in <HI>Boston,</HI> and other places, in the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> case, sink in their value, and become worth less than <HI>forty pounds,</HI> while in that person's hands, the security given will, in no manner, compen∣sate that loss to the possessor; for neither he, nor even the public, can have any satisfaction from the security; because, if the borrower re∣turns the bills again, when due from him, though they should not then be worth <HI>twenty pounds</HI> of that coin, by which they were first rated, his security will be entirely discharged by the payment. This is most evi∣dent and plain to any man of reason, who will make use of it: but per∣sons over-run with the common notions, depending on the applause of such as are ready prepared to give it to every thing, favouring their own opinions, may think it sufficient for answering the most certain truth, barely to deny it, and confide in the numbers, that are to support their assertions; which we conceive has been the only motive to those persons, who drew up, or presented the paper, now under consideration; but the unhandsome reflections, that are cast, in that part of it, shall, for the present, be waved, and referred to the close of this, as a more proper place.</P>
<P>In our fifth and sixth heads we asserted, that such schemes as were then commonly talked of, were partial, weak and unjust; as they were intended to make grants very beneficial to the first borrower, but injuri∣ous to the others: that all would equally covet the same advantage; but that, from the nature of the thing, all could not possibly partake of it; unless the quantity of the bills were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast as to render them of little, or no value. The truth of all which is so clear and plain, that it would be little less than a mockery to human reason, to offer arguments for supporting what, if understood, is self-evident. But this is now entire∣ly out of time, the wisdom of the Assembly having admitted none of those schemes, there guarded against, and it will be difficult to find a reason for offering that part of the paper to the House, after all the votes, that have been passed on this affair, unless it be to prepare, with an extreme modesty, for another push, to overset all that has hitherto been voted.</P>
<P>Their whole answer to the seventh head is grounded on another great mistake, in the cause of the rise of silver amongst us; which is truly thus: In the year 1709, when the act of parliament, for reducing our coin, took place, silver was our common currency; gold being then but rarely seen; but as it was judged necessary (seeing the act was silent in it) to make that also, as well as silver, pass current by weight, at some determinate rate; and being, at that time, worth four pounds an ounce, or four shillings per penny weight, in <HI>Britain,</HI> it was advanced in the same proportion with sil∣ver, (<HI>viz.</HI> one third) to <HI>five shillings and four pence</HI> per penny weight; but because this sum could not be so divided by twenty-four, as to render it practicable to reckon single grains by farthings, without a fraction, it was, by common consent, raised to <HI>five shillings and six pence,</HI> that a grain might be accounted at <HI>two pence three farthings.</HI> This seeming small difference, with the advance given in <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>East India</HI> compa∣ny for <HI>Spanish silver,</HI> wrought so great a change in our currency, that our payments were mostly made in gold, <HI>New York and Britain</HI> gradu∣ally exhausting our silver; insomuch that, even, nine or ten years ago, five per cent. advance was given, in gold, in exchange for <HI>Spanish sil∣ver;</HI> though afterwards, upon a greater importation of the latter, this difference, for some time, abated; but gold having still further fallen in value, in <HI>Britain,</HI> the disparity has again further increased; for account∣ing pieces of eight, only at <HI>five shillings and four pence</HI> per ounce, which is under a medium for their common price; and gold at <HI>three pounds eighteen shillings,</HI> which is near its present, or late value, in <HI>England;</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ounce of <HI>Spanish</HI> silver is truly equivalent to <HI>seven shillings and six pence,</HI> in gold, at <HI>five pounds ten shillings</HI> per ounce, as we rate it. It is there∣fore, neither <HI>avarice,</HI> nor <HI>sharping,</HI> that has occasioned this advance, in the exchange of these two metals, but the essential difference, in their intrinsic value, at the market, to which they are carried; which is es∣timated by rules, that ever will prevail among competent reasoners on the basis of trade; though such, as go beyond their <HI>last,</HI> will meddle with matters out of their sphere, are uncapable of comprehending them.</P>
<P>But, from hence a sure rule may be taken, in relation to paper that by so much as the value of public bills sink, by so much will gold and silver rise, in proportion to their intrinsic worth; as we find our sil∣ver has done, in proportion to our gold; and the constant standard, to measure this by, will be the exchange between the <HI>English</HI> colony, where they are made current, and <HI>Great Britain.</HI> From hence the loss on bills is to be estimated in all places, where they pass: the exchange in <HI>New York,</HI> before the bills fell, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1716, was <HI>fifty</HI> per cent. and in <HI>Boston,</HI> not long before; but since 1717, the year they uttered their last great quantity of bills, it arose to <HI>sixty-five</HI> per cent. and in <HI>Boston,</HI> it is now near <HI>one hundred and fifty</HI> per cent. as in <HI>Carolina,</HI> it is from <HI>five to six cents</HI> advance on <HI>one hundred pounds sterling.</HI></P>
<P>The answer to the eighth is of a piece with the rest, a presumptu∣ous denial of a positive truth, that is in itself incontestible; for the lan∣guage of the <HI>New York</HI> bill runs thus, <HI>viz.</HI> for a bill of <HI>twenty shillings; "This bill, of two ounces ten penny weight of plate, due from the colony of New York to the possessor thereof, shall be equal, in value, to Seville pillar,</HI> or <HI>Mexico plate,"</HI> &amp;c. And yet that very bill shall, at this time, purchase very little more, (if any thing) in pieces of eight, than <HI>two ounces.</HI> It is, therefore, undeniably true, that such a bill is not equivalent to <HI>two ounces and a half</HI> of such plate; because, being fallen from its first in∣tended value, it will not purchase so much: and it is really surprising how any men, in direct contradiction to common sense, can amuse themselves and others with such groundless notions. The price of goods at <HI>New York,</HI> whether cheaper or dearer, than at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> is out of the ques∣tion; unless it could be alledged, that a bill of <HI>twenty shillings</HI> will pur∣chase as much of those goods, as can be bought with the real weight of <HI>two ounces and a half</HI> of <HI>Spanish</HI> silver; which the boldest assertor will scarce venture to affirm.</P>
<P>We further beg leave to observe, on their answer to the three last articles:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That to supply the want of a medium for commerce is the honest intention of the proposal for <HI>bills of credit,</HI> and not to discharge the debts of those who want means, from the public, to get clear of them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All bills, bonds, &amp;c. on an equal security, are the more valued, the sooner they become due; and the sooner public bills are to sink, the greater will be their credit. It is true, that the longer the time is, the more easy it may seem to the first borrower; but, in the whole course of the bills, after their second payment, this will but di∣minish their credit. If <HI>eight</HI> years be preferable to <HI>five,</HI> because of the length of the time, the same argument may be urged for <HI>sixteen</HI> or <HI>twenty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is extremely mannerly (we grant) to leave it entirely to the Assembly, to consider the manner of sinking the bills; but this com∣plaisance, it is doubted, is more owing to an unconcernedness in that point, when, or whether ever, they sink, provided they are once obtain∣ed, than to any real modesty; otherwise, it was certainly a breach of that, after the House had voted both the sum and the time, not to ac∣quiesce in their wisdom, but to solicit an enlargement.</P>
<P>We pay as great a deference, may it please the House, to the legis∣lative authority, as any others; yet we well know their wisdom will in∣fluence them to lend constantly an open ear to all necessary hints from without doors, that may contribute any advantage to the important af∣fairs, brought from time to time, under their consideration.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that we shall yet crave liberty to offer our further sentiments, not only in relation to a paper credit, but upon some other points, that nearly concern the prosperity of this colony.</P>
<P>Such bills, we find, have been issued in <HI>America,</HI> on two different, foundations; the one has been to raise a large sum immediately, on the credit of future taxes, duties, &amp;c. by which they were to be regularly sunk in time; the other to be lent out on securities, and to be sunk by the borrowers repaying them into the treasury. Those of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>South Carolina</HI> were by the first method, and those of <HI>New England.</HI> and <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> by the second.</P>
<P>In <HI>Carolina</HI> they were obliged, for the defence of their town and country, against some threatened invasions, to raise an immense sum, for so small a colony, vastly exceeding the occasions they had for a currency, especially since their <HI>rice,</HI> which foreigners come to carry away, will purchase most of the goods they want; and this sunk the credit of their bills to the low state they were depressed to. In <HI>New York,</HI> their first bills, raised by the same method, <HI>viz.</HI> by anticipating the duties, by which they were to be sunk again, kept up their credit; and, because of the certainty of their terminating, and the quantity being moderate, for a place of such large and extended commerce, they continued of equal value with their current silver, until the year 1717, when they issued another large sum▪ and for a longer term; upon which their credit im∣mediately fell to a disparity with their real money.</P>
<P>Farther to the castward, their bills being issued on loans only, by which method they cannot be called in, with so much certainty, they consequently fell more than one third below the value, at which they were first struck; and the same may be expected from the like measures to happen here; for seeing very few borrowers are found to discharge their mortgages to private persons, in time, and according to contract, it will be expected that the public, to whom such loud cries are raised, for succour to the distressed, will rather be more indulgent, than ri∣gorous, to their humble suppliants.</P>
<P>It will, therefore, be evident, that to keep up the credit of bills, the quantity must be moderate, and should be somewhat under a suffici∣ency for a circulating currency, that we may, as they do in <HI>New York,</HI> contrive means to supply ourselves with some quantities of cash, which is real treasure in a country, while bills are no more than borrowing from one another without adding one penny to the wealth or stock of the colony; and next, that a certainty of their being sunk in a reasona∣ble time, will principally contribute to support that credit.</P>
<P>It was observed before, in the last article, presented by us, to the House, that such measures ought to be taken for this, as shall render it absolutely necessary for the public, that the bills shall be sunk regularly.</P>
<P>It is therefore, upon the whole, with all due submission, proposed to the consideration of the House, whether it may not be rather requisite to retrench the quantity, last voted, than to augment it, as some de∣sire; considering that <HI>ten pounds</HI> of that currency will probably cir∣culate more and faster than <HI>twenty</HI> or <HI>thirty</HI> of gold or silver; because the latter has a constant intrinsic value, while the other, more subject to change, and designed only for a medium of commerce, will be more briskly shifted from hand to hand, to answer that pupose? and whether the following methods of applying it may not render it more serviceable; <HI>viz.</HI> that, seeing the public is now, by the Treasurer's account, besides some other sums not yet settled, above <HI>one thousand six hundred pounds</HI> in debt, and the support, for the ensuing year, is yet to be provided for, a sum of about <HI>three thousand pounds,</HI> to be paid out of the bills, to be sunk, by an excise, or such other method as the House shall best approve of, for returning that sum, in three, four or five years, as shall be judged most convenient.</P>
<P>That a sum, sufficient to finish the <HI>prison and workhouse</HI> of <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> be lent out of the bills of the city and county, to be returned into the treasury, by a yearly tax on the inhabitants, not exceeding one <HI>penny per pound,</HI> till the said sum be discharged; the present taxes of <HI>three pence per pound</HI> being too heavy, in these difficult times, for the public to bear.</P>
<P>That the rest be lent out, as is already proposed to the House, on good unquestionable securities, at the interest agreed on; but, for the better assuring their sinking, that all public monies, raised by any taxes, excise, or duties whatsoever, be paid into the respective treasuries only in that specie, to be there sunk; and the full value of such public monies be made good out of the sums, paid in by the borrowers, whether in coin, paper, or country produce, to answer the ends, for which the same was raised; by which means the bills must necessarily be sunk, and the payments be duly made by the borrowers, without any excuse or sa∣vour.</P>
<P>That, for the more effectual support of the credit of the bills, <HI>six∣pence in the pound</HI> be allowed to the person, who pays them in, as pub∣lic money, to be made good out of the interest, paid by the borrower.</P>
<P>These measures, may it please the House, it is believed, will very much contribute to answer the just ends, proposed by the bills, with the least injury, or loss, to the receivers.</P>
<P>The reflections, in this last paper, as well as others, which have industriously been rendered popular, shall be answered, by shewing, from the state of the country, how destructive to its true interest that spirit is, to which too many appear to have resigned themselves, that those, who are sincerely well affected to the public, may, with a more distinguish∣ing judgment, observe the measures, by which our common interest may be most effectually promoted; for which end, we beg leave to add the following remarks, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That this small colony, consisting, at present, only of three coun∣ties, and of no extraordinary soil, situate but on one side of one naviga∣ble river; is, therefore, inferior, in natural advantages, to all others around us; and having no produce, but what other colonies, more com∣modiously situated, not only rival us in, but, of late, have outdone us, we cannot, therefore, equally flourish with others, unless we compensate these natural defects, by such improvements, in industry, and other good qualities, as may deservedly acquire us a reputation.</P>
<P>That the husbandman and merchant are the principal supporters of the colony, from whom all other kinds of business, among us, receive their encouragement; the one raising the produce, and the other export∣ing it by navigation.</P>
<P>That, by the common methods of our trade, for want of a vent abroad, for our wheat, and what is manufactured from it, we can never become considerable; and therefore it is necessary that the countryman should endeavour for some other improvements, and the merchant labour to find out new channels for commere, by pursuing it in all the branches, that may lie open to us, in other countries; for both these will ever, in reality, have a natural dependence on each other.</P>
<P>That it is an unhappiness to this country, that there are not more wealthy men in trade, who, by large stocks, could force such an extend∣ed commerce, as in <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>Boston;</HI> for by these means more ship∣ping, and therefore, more workmen and people would be employed; and both a greater exportation and consumption of the country produce, to the encouragement of the farmer, would be occasioned by it.</P>
<P>That it has ever been accounted a great advantage to a country, to have men in it, who can supply others with money, in their necessities, on such terms as the laws approve; for, from such opportunities, the industrious and ingenious, who, for want of something in their hands, might be ever tied down to poverty, may find means to raise themselves (as many have done) to fortunes and a capacity of being extremely use∣ful; from hence many have received vast advantages, by compassing bargains, that otherwise they must, forever have gone without. In short, there is nothing more equitable than that the active and industrious should, for a moderate consideration, have the use of other men's stocks, who either for want of skill, or inclination, cannot employ it them∣selves.</P>
<P>That the wealth of a country consists of the riches of its inhabi¦tants, and the richer any country is, the better it is for a poor man to live in. All these being unquestionable truths, it is as astonishing to consider, while we have scarce one man in the country, that can be ac∣counted rich, when compared with divers in other colonies; while the province really suffers for want of more men of ability, to promote its interest, and enlarge its commerce; on which great numbers of the people have their dependance; while money can scarce be had on any terms, to lend, or borrow, and seldom ever could be obtained on loan, but by entreaty, and with solicitation; it is astonishing, we say, to con∣sider how it is possible, that there should be any amongst us, who, is despite of common sense, will suffer themselves to be misled into such a spirit of malignity, as, in direct opposition to the interest of the whole, to insult and abuse those few, in the place, who are the most capable of promoting that interest; to return reproaches for what was obtained by prayer; and under the endearing appearance of popularity, to strike at the very sinews of a country's strength, and the evident means of its prosperity; in which all would, according to their ranks, be more or less partakers.</P>
<P>We humbly crave the House's excuse for these observations, which the unhappy prevailing humour of the time (as the honourable House, from the last, and other applications, cannot but be sensible) has ren∣dered necessary, for rectifying the distempered notions of the misguided. On which no better advice (we conceive) can be recommended to such persons, than that of the apostle, viz, <HI>"To fellow after the things, which make for their peace; to study to be quiet, and to do their own business,"</HI> &amp;c. as he has recommended. Rom. xiv ch. 19 ver. 1. Thess. iv ch. 11 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Although it is true, we are, at present, very poor, yet love and unity appear not less wanting among us, than money; and while we are applying to the Legislature for means to supply the one, if we could be so happy as to join in the other, it would mere effectually render it easy to this honourable House to provide for our public necessities, which, that we may, is the earnest desire of their most <HI>faithful friend.</HI></P>
</LETTER></NOTE></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentiments of divers gentlemen and mer∣chants, &amp;c.</NOTE>Being admitted, upon our address to the House, presented yesterday, to exhibit any further sentiments, in relation to a <HI>paper credit,</HI> now vi∣gorously pressed to be established by law; we
<PB N="153" REF="034421_0153_0FFD9F3B6EF894F8"/>
accordingly offer the following heads, which may be supported by solid arguments, when the House thinks fit to require them.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in∣stitution of the paper currency.</NOTE> That as this province derives all its powers from, and is wholly dependent on the kingdom of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it will be the highest wisdom in our Legislature, upon all exigencies, to direct themselves by the same prudent and just measures, which the parliaments of that kingdom have always pursued, in the like cases; in whom nothing has been more conspicuous than a most strict care, that no subject should lose by the coin, or public credit, of the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="034421_0154_0FFD9F665A98A3B8"/><HI>Secondly,</HI> That as, when the nation was most grievously distressed, in the time of a dangerous and expensive war, by a general debasing of their current coin, the parliament would hearken to no proposal (though many were made) for relieving the state, by raising the new minted money to a higher value; but, under the vastest difficulties, renewed it, at the same weight and fineness, to pass at the former rates; which they have unalter∣ably kept to. And further, by the sum of <HI>twelve hundred thousand pounds,</HI> made good to private persons all the loss of exchanging their clipped and debased coin, for the new milled money, which was delivered out at a par to them: so the like justice and prudence requires, that no further alteration, than what the parliament has made here, should, on any terms, be admitted, in the value of our gold and silver, but that it still con∣tinue, as it now passes.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034421_0155_0FFD9F7311043B50"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That, as the parliament, as often as they found it necessary to issue bills of credit, called exchequer bills, or notes, took the utmost ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to keep them equal in value with silver, by giving the <HI>Bank of England,</HI> when they fell into any discount, vast sums of money, to receive those bills, as their own, and to exchange them with ready cash, on the demand of the bearer: so it appears absolutely necessary, that if bills of credit be raised here, due care should be taken (since we can have no such <HI>banks,</HI> in this province, as are in <HI>Europe,</HI> whose rules are to pay down ready money for their bills, upon demand) to establish them on so just a foundation, that, while in being, they may still continue of the same value with real mo∣ney, according to the rates, at which they are at first issued.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="034421_0156_0FFD9F27F69315A8"/><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That, if those bills be issued on any easier terms to the receiver, than gold, or silver would be, if it were to be paid, or lent, out of the treasury, by how much easier these terms are, by so much, at least, will the bills fall in value; for credit has its own laws, as unalterable in them∣selves, as those of motion, or gravity, are, in na∣ture, and which, such, as are versed in these affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> as carefully consider.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That the schemes most commonly talked of, for lending out sums, to be discharged by annual payments, equal to, or not much ex∣ceeding, the interest, for a certain number of years, without paying any principal, are partial and unjust, and would be destructive to public credit; bacause the consideration given is not an equivalent to the sum received.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="034421_0157_0FFD9EDEE0CEA6B0"/>For instance, should <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> be lent out, to be discharged, by the payment only of eight pounds annually, for sixteen years; were such an annuity to be bought, according to the known rules for purchasing estates, it would here be worth no more than <HI>seventy pounds sixteen shil∣lings and three pence,</HI> in ready money; nor is an annuity for nine pounds ten shillings per annum, for twelve years, worth more than <HI>seventy-one pounds twelve shillings.</HI> In either of these cases, the borrower, could he discharge debts of that value with it, though he were to pay the annuity in gold and silver, would gain near thirty pounds by the loan, but no other person would feel the least advantage by it; now, if no man would let out his own money on these terms, none ought to desire it so of the public; the credit of which is of vastly greater importance, than any private per∣sons; because a failure, in that, affects the fortune of every individual, in his money, the medium of his commerce and dealing.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="034421_0158_0FFD9F5BC78CC510"/><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That all such projects are either ex∣ceedingly weak, or unjust; for the paper money is to be lent either to all, who shall desire it, on a tender of the security, proposed, or to some only: if to all (as it is natural for all men to desire what they may gain by) it will be impracticable to strike enough, to answer all demands; or, if it were struck, it would, because of its quantity, become of little, or no value; if to a few only, what tribunal can be erected, to judge and distinguish, who of the King's subjects, are to be admitted to the favour, and who to be rejected? If the poor only are to be the objects, they have not security to give, or, if they had, perhaps they have as lit∣tle merit as any: commonly people become weal∣thy by sobriety and industry, the most useful qua∣lifications in a commonwealth, and poor by luxury, idleness and folly. What rules then can be found, for dispensing the public favours?</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="034421_0159_0FFD9EE15053DAF8"/><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That by these schemes, the more the currency, or paper money falls in value (by which word <HI>falling,</HI> is meant the <HI>rising</HI> of gold, silver, English goods, and all other commodities, in nominal value, which is the certain proof of the other's falling) the greater is the borrower's advan∣tage; for the more easily will he pay his annuity; so that he may happen, by virtue of the act, to discharge, with the value of twenty pounds, a debt of <HI>one hundred,</HI> due to the man, who, per∣haps, kindly lent him the money, to relieve him in distress, or honestly sold him his land, or goods, at their real value, at the time of lending, or sale.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="034421_0160_0FFD9F3ECD9F6D40"/><HI>Eighthly,</HI> That all those deceive themselves, who, because gold and silver may be had at New York, or other places, in exchange for their pa∣per money, suppose that the one, therefore, is as good as the other, unless the silver can be had at <HI>eight shillings</HI> per ounce, or the gold at <HI>six shillings</HI> per penny weight, at <HI>New York,</HI> as they were rated at the first striking of their bills; but when their silver brings from <HI>nine</HI> to <HI>ten</HI> shillings per ounce, and their light pistoles pass at twenty-eight shillings, or higher, then bills are truly so much fallen in va∣lue, as the others are advanced. So, in <HI>Carolina,</HI> silver is to be purchased for their bills, but it is at <HI>thirty shillings</HI> per ounce, though they were struck, as is said, at <HI>seven shillings</HI> only!</P>
<P>These being premised as general heads, what next follows, is to point out what are conceived to be the only means of supporting the credit of such a currency, if issued.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="034421_0161_0FFD9F0A4F323E58"/><HI>First,</HI> That the whole sum struck be but small, and just sufficient to pass from hand to hand, for a currency.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it be not continued for any longer time; for the paper will wear out, and it will not be so easy to exchange it for new, as some have imagined; which, it is much to be doubted, will be found impracticable: besides, the sooner it is to expire, the more easily will people be satisfied to take it. But further, our laws can continue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That care be taken to force the sink∣ing of it in course, and in a just manner, by mea∣sures, that shall render it absolutely necessary for the public to have it sunk; which, it is conceived,
<PB N="162" REF="034421_0162_0FFD9F4CDDFD69F8"/>
none of the methods hitherto discoursed of will effect. These heads, may it please the House, are what we have, at present, humbly to offer to your consideration, on this subject.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>A few days after this was presented to the House, the Governor also delivered them his sentiments, in writing, on the same subject, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Assembly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith's sen∣timents on introducing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paper currency.</NOTE>I have, at your request, very carefully consi∣dered the resolutions of the House, upon your journals, relating to public credit; and also some things, which, I find, have been offered to you, upon the same subject.</P>
<P>Credit may, no doubt, be compared to the mathematics, in so far as both sciences will admit
<PB N="163" REF="034421_0163_0FFD9F2A65912448"/>
of deducing solid conclusions from self-evident and clear principles; and yet, by the subtilty of an artist, truth, or falsehood, in either of them, is often so wrapped up and involved, that it is lost unto, or misapprehended by the plainest, and, generally speaking, much the honestest part of mankind.</P>
<P>But the common necessity, and general inte∣rest of the whole body of the people, being a sub∣ject of importance, on which we ought to speak plainly, and act freely, I shall, without any pre∣amble, or disguise whatever, communicate my thoughts to you, in the simplest, and most intelli∣gible manner, that I can.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If it be true, that the riches and pro∣sperity of this province chiefly depend on the ma∣nufacture of provisions, and the exchanging of that manufacture, with other things, to advantage, it will also be true, that whatever increases the one, and, at the same time, encourages the other, will
<PB N="164" REF="034421_0164_0FFD9EE3C0A901A0"/>
justly deserve the name of a public good; and the majority of those, employed in such manufacture and exchange, have thereby a right to be consi∣dered as the body of the people, whom you repre∣sent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is evident, that, where there is no public debt, and a real value, in lands, to be pledged, paper money may, if there is occasion for it, be struck to advantage, without any risk at all; for though, perhaps, it may contribute to hurt some weak people, in the ill management of their private affairs, yet, while any unfrugal per∣son is lost to the community, and is succeeded by one more industrious than he, the public cannot suffer by such a change.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If, in the case of a paper currency, among us, it should happen to follow (as it may be supposed it will) that silver and gold will be kept up for remittances to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we shall then have no other means of dealing with one ano∣ther, but the paper: should the quantity, there∣fore,
<PB N="165" REF="034421_0165_0FFD9F0D9D4CC350"/>
be less than is necessary to circulate our home trade, in its natural course, usurers and sharpers would have the same opportunity as they have now, to lie at catch for bargains, and make a monopoly of trade, by engrossing the current money into their hands.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The very essence and nature of cre∣dit, as well as the practice and experience of the greatest banks in <HI>Europe,</HI> directs all such bills to be issued at something less than the common interest, for that is, in effect, a premium by the public, to encourage their circulation: and whosoever is pleased to say, that the bank of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> loses credit, by lending money at <HI>two per cent.</HI> or the bank of <HI>England,</HI> by lending money at <HI>four per cent.</HI> shall scarce prevail with me to think the asser∣tion worthy of any answer.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I am not of opinion with those gen∣tlemen, who are pleased to alledge, that the value of silver, at <HI>New York,</HI> which, in the month of September last, was from <HI>eight shillings</HI> and <HI>six
<PB N="166" REF="034421_0166_0FFD9EE665ADC850"/>
pence</HI> to <HI>eight shillings</HI> and <HI>nine pence,</HI> is occasioned by their paper; for, in this province, where there never has been any paper yet, from <HI>five to ten per cent.</HI> has, for several years, been given in exchange for silver. And as to their computation of gold, the gentlemen, perhaps, have not had occasion, of late, to be informed, that the heaviest <HI>pistoles,</HI> in <HI>York,</HI> go at no more than <HI>twenty-eight shillings,</HI> and smaller, or cut gold, at the common standard value, in that province; where, it is believed, the people could not possibly carry on half the quantity of their present trade and business, without the help of paper.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> I must also take leave to differ, in opinion, with those, who, without enquiry, and by wholesale, are pleased to condemn all schemes of lending money, to be discharged by annual pay∣ments; for I truly think that method will not only suit the different circumstances and conveniency of
<PB N="167" REF="034421_0167_0FFD9F2CD39B3210"/>
the people best, but, in all respects, will prove the safest and most profitable, as well as equal; and my reasons for it, are these:</P>
<P N="1">1st. Whatever quantity be issued, if one fifth, sixth, or tenth part, of the sum, according to the time, for which it is to last, must necessarily come into office every year, it may be lent out again, at <HI>five per cent.</HI> for any time, within the term, to such persons as had no place, or opportunity, to come into the first loan: by which means all the frightful, odd things, mentioned in the gentle∣men's sixth observation, will presently vanish; for every man, in this case, according to his ability, may, if he thinks fit, share in that advantage; which the public most generously and prudently offers to the necessities of the people.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly, If so great a share of the whole comes in yearly to the office, in order to be lent out again, it will, in a great measure, prevent engrossing,
<PB N="168" REF="034421_0168_0FFD9F0F207130E8"/>
and help the circulation considerably; it will also give more frequent opportunity of discovering frauds, and gradually increase the public stock and revenue of the bank; and by that means it will demonstrably sink the original sum, within the time prefixed; that is to say, the paper, at the end of that term, will either be found in the office, or its value in cash, ready to pay what shall then happen, by accident, to be yet abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> If too great a security is demanded for the loan of public money, I think, it will, in a great measure, frustrate the design of relieving many of the middling, or most industrious, sort of the people; wherefore, it is my opinion, that
<PB N="169" REF="034421_0169_0FFD9EE9334C4F18"/>
one half of the value of ground rents may very safely be lent to those, who are willing and able to give such security.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> If, upon further consideration, you find that the sum intended may be issued to better advantage, for a longer time, I think the objection, that our acts can only subsist <HI>five years,</HI> without being approved, is of no weight; for, besides, that it would not be very civil, to suppose that the legislative authority here would deliberately go up∣on any act of that importance, or indeed, of any kind, which we had the least cause to suspect would be disagreeable to his Majesty, or the sentiments of his ministry: we know very well, it is in his Majesty's royal power and prerogative, to repeal and make void, at any time, all acts of Assembly, to be made, or passed, in <HI>America:</HI> and, for my
<PB N="170" REF="034421_0170_0FFD9F7709988EE8"/>
part, if I did not, in my conscience, believe that the act, now proposed, would be made on such a rational, just and equal foot, as would rather claim his Majesty's gracious favour, in assenting to it, than render it obnoxious to his impartial justice, I should neither have given myself nor you this trouble.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, these are most frankly and sin∣cerely my present sentiments of the matter before you; and, as I do not find myself inclined to dis∣pute, and much less to shew any stiffness, or ob∣stinacy, in an affair of such a general concern, I shall very much rely on your diligent circumspec∣tion and care, for the good of your country, being still ready and willing to give you all the assistance in my power.</P>

<P>"The bills of credit, emitted in the year 1723, being thus reduced by the sinking of the aforesaid sum, and the inhabitants of the province growing exceeding numerous, through the importation of foreigners, and others settling among us; by which means the trade became greatly enlarged; and the difficulties still increased, and the province found themselves under the necessity of making an addition to those bills of credit; and accordingly, in the year 1729, the further sum of <HI>thirty thou∣sand pounds</HI> was then created, and issued upon the same security of real estates, in <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e simple,</HI> to be mortgaged in double the value of the sum lent; and to be paid in by yearly quotas, and sunk and destroyed, as the former acts, passed in the year 1723, had provided and directed in the case.</P>

<P>"The amount of the bills of credit, in the present year 1739, by virtue of the several afore∣said acts, amounting only to £. 69,889 15, from the daily increase of the inhabitants, and the con∣tinued importation of foreigners, among us, being found by experience, to fall short of a proper me∣dium, for negociating our commerce, and for the support of government, an act was passed for cre∣ating and issuing a farther sum of <HI>eleven thousand one hundred and ten pounds five shillings,</HI> and for continuing the whole amount of our bills of cre∣dit, for a short time of years, under the same real securities, and with the same provisions and limi∣tations, as directed by the former acts; by means of which additional sum, the whole amount of the bills of credit, current in the province, is at this time <HI>eighty thousand pounds:</HI> which sum being computed, as now purchased here, and reduced to sterling money of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> makes £, 50,196.

All which clearly shews that the Proprietary's intention, in that charter, was not to bind up himself, nor Lieutenants from <HI>advising</HI> and <HI>consulting</HI> with others, in legislation. It also further shews his resolution to guard, in the language of the charter, against those, who, a little before that time, had started up, in opposition to him, and his interest, and sought to turn his kindest grants of favour, to serve the unkindest purposes against him, that they might from thence have no manner of just pre∣tence against his further proceedings, in taking the best precaution he could, for his, and the country's security, during his absence.</P><P>"And, in order to this, he immediately, by letters patent, under the great seal, bearing even date, with the charter, <HI>viz.</HI> the 28th of October, 1701, established a <HI>Council, to consult and assist the Proprietary himself, or his Lieutenants, or Deputies, with the best of their advice and counsel, in pub∣lic affairs, and matters relating to the government, and to the peace, well-being and safely of the people thereof; and in the absence of the Proprietary, or upon the Liuetenant's death, or incapacity, to exercise all and singular, the powers of government,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>It gave me no small concern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The widow Penn's let∣ter to the Assembly, in 1726.</NOTE> when I received the <HI>remonstrance</HI> of the 20th of March, 1724-5, from the late House of Representatives of the free∣men of the province of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> with their resolution, that some part of a private letter of instructions, sent by me to the late Deputy Go∣vernor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written after the appointment of Governor Gordon, and was probably sent by him.</NOTE> was contrary to the liberties and privi∣leges, granted by charter to the people of that province; and my concern was the greater, when I considered, that, as their happiness had ever been the peculiar care of my late husband, in his life time, so the continuance of it has been no less the desire of myself, and the whole family, ever since his death. I purposed long ere this time to have answered that remonstrance, but finding my sincere intentions to preserve peace and unanimity, in the province, had been manifestly perverted, to the great disquiet of the people; and that too by those, whose duty it was to have acted another part, I was willing to lay hold of a more favourable opportunity, (when you might be left to your own prudent deliberations, without being influ∣enced to misinterpret the good intentions of the 
<PB N="186" REF="034421_0186_0FFD9F1A226BA158"/>
family towards you) to assure you, that, if, at any time, I fall short of doing any thing, that may advance your interest and reputation, it must proceed only from my not having it in my power. And as to that part of my letter, which was made use of to procure that remonstrance, I do acknow∣ledge it was designed as a cautionary direction, or limitation, upon the acting Governor; but with∣out the least apprehension that it could ever have been construed, by the Assembly, as any design upon the liberties of the freemen of <HI>Pensilvania:</HI> because the <HI>Council,</HI> according to its constitution, either is, or ought to be, composed of persons of the best circumstances and abilities, residing and inhabiting within the said province; and whose interest must, without all doubt, be the same with your own, and that of the people, whom you re∣present. Nor was this instruction any other, but, in effect, the same with what had ever been given, by my late husband, your Proprietor, to all his Deputy Governors: and (without mentioning the unhappy occasion given, for writing that letter) I was the rather induced to renew this instruction, because by the proceedings of your own House, but a few years ago, it appears, the then Assembly expressed a very particular concern at the Deputy Governor's declining to take the <HI>advice</HI> of the <HI>Council,</HI> upon the bills, sent to him, from their House, to be passed into laws:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Governor Gookin, vid. pag 91, &amp;c.</NOTE> and, therefore, I must conclude, that, if in this, you had been en∣tirely left to have followed the resolutions of your own judgments, you would have continued of the same sentiments, and have judged it a very <HI>necessa∣ry instruction,</HI> at that time, all circumstances con∣sidered; (but more especially if you had been aware of what has happened but too plainly since) that this very remonstrance was obtained with de∣sign to wrest the government out of the hands of

the Proprietor's family; and by that means, at once, to deprive you of those valuable privileges, secured to you, as well by the royal charter, grant∣ed to the late Proprietor, as by the several grants and laws, made by him, under the same; for the preservation of which you express so just a con∣cern: and I do assure you, it is not easy for me to say, whether for your safety, or my own, I am better pleased that this attempt upon the rights of our family, and your privileges, has proved un∣successful: and, without saying any more of that piece of management, I hope, we shall, all of us, learn to cultivate and maintain so entire an agree∣ment, and mutual good understanding, as may preserve us from ever becoming a prey to design∣ing men; who, it is evident (notwithstanding their fair pretences) consider none of us in any other light, than to serve their own ends and pur∣poses, even, though at the expence of all that is valuable to us. My age, and low state of health make it tedious and difficult for me to apply my thoughts to business; and, therefore, I shall add no more, but that the <HI>Governor,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Governor Gordon.</NOTE> appointed by my grandson,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Springett.</NOTE> with the concurrence and consent of the family, is, for his prudence, well recom∣mended to us here, and hath, in charge, from us, as much as lies in his power, to do every thing, which he lawfully may, to make you a happy people; which we apprehend to be the surest way to advance the interest of our family, in <HI>Pensilva∣nia,</HI> as well as most agreeable to my own inclina∣tion and desires.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1725.</NOTE>THE use of an <HI>affirmation,</HI> instead of an oath, in all cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the af∣firmation act, esta∣blished in Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE> was one of those privileges, for the enjoyment of which <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> was first set∣tled by the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and which they had en∣joyed uninterrupted for above twenty years, with the happy effects of the consequence thereof, in the province. But after the resumption of the government, on the laws being revised, in 1700 and 1701, the law respecting the manner of giv∣ing evidence, with divers others, were remitted to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in Council, in 1705; when the said law was repealed; not with design to deprive the <HI>Quakers</HI> there of the said privilege, but solely on account of its making the punishment, for false

affirming, greater than the law of <HI>England</HI> re∣quired, for false swearing; as appears by the At∣torney General <HI>Northey's</HI> opinion thereon.</P>
<P>The repealing of this law occasioned much dif∣ficulty among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the province; and divers attempts were made, from time to time, for reviving the aforesaid privilege, but without success, till the year 1725, when an act, pre∣scribing the forms of declaration of <HI>fidelity, abju∣ration</HI> and <HI>affirmation,</HI> instead of the forms before required, having been passed in the province, was ratified by the King, in Council; and thereby became perpetual.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>New Jersey,</HI> were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And in New Jersey &amp;c.</NOTE> for a con∣siderable time, subject to similar difficulties, upon the same account; though the equity of their right to an <HI>affirmation,</HI> in their own form, was as old as the constitution; and, in fact, the settle∣ment of the province primarily depended upon the enjoyment of that religious and civil liberty,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>The form of the declaration of <HI>fidelity.</HI></P><P>"I, A.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>This meeting, under a weighty sense of the great favour, which it hath pleased the Lord to incline the heart of the king, and those in the government, to grant us; by passing into a law, a <HI>form of solemn affirm∣ation,</HI> which will remove the conscientious scruples, that many Friends lay under, (and thereby enable all to follow their lawful occupations, trades, and civil concerns, without let, or hindrance, on any account) doth find a concern to recommend to all <HI>Friends,</HI> in their quarterly, monthly, or particular meetings, where this law doth, or may extend:</P>
<P>That they, in an especial manner, have a watchful eye and oversight of their several members, that this great favour be not <HI>abused,</HI> or <HI>misused,</HI> by any professing truth with us.</P>
<P>Our blessed Lord, and Lawgiver, <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> told his disciples, <HI>"Ye are the light of the world; a city, that is set on a hill, cannot be hid."</HI> And in every age, as many as do walk in obedience to his gospel, must unavoidably be so; <HI>the daily cross and self-denial,</HI> which he doth enjoin, (those sure tokens of a Christian disciple) are public marks, which are easily seen, and readily observed, by those, with whom we have occasion of business, or concern; and our transacting thereof with uprightness, justice and moderation will shew that we have an awful regard to our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whom we acknowledge and declare to be our great Lawgiver and Example.</P>
<P>The great end and design of the new covenant, <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> which is come by him, is to draw men into obedience to his law, written in the heart; by which only the inside can be made clean; and accord∣ing to the degrees of obedience to this divine law, which the apostle calls, <HI>The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,</HI> the proper effect thereof will appear; that is, <HI>the inside will be made clean also.</HI> Hereby <HI>truth, justice, righteousness</HI> and <HI>charity</HI> will shine forth in the words and actions of such; and then may be truly applied to them that saying of <HI>Christ; a city, that is set upon a hill, cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P>Beside the inward engagements of this divine law, to speak and act according to truth, there is, at this time, also an outward engagement, which the government hath laid upon us, not only by the favour of this act, but also by the manner, wherein they have conferred it: for, in the preamble, it is said; <HI>it is manifest that the said people called Quakers, have not abused the liberty and indulgence, allowed them by law.</HI> Which tes∣timony of the Legislature concerning the use of the late <HI>solemn affirmation,</HI> upon twenty-five years experience, ought, at least, to stir up all Friends to great watchfulness and care, in the use of this further ease and relief; that this testimony may be continued, and thereby confirm the govern∣ment in their favourable sentiments concerning us.</P>
<P>And as this signal indulgence may draw the eyes and observation of many people upon us, it may be expected, among these, some will look on us with an evil eye, watch for our halting, and seek occasion against us, upon any misuse, or abuse, of this legal privilege, which any, pro∣fessing truth with us, or but bearing the name, should fall into, or com∣mit.</P>
<P>First, therefore, that there may be no misuse of this favour, we do earnestly desire and entreat, that the several meetings do advise and exhort <HI>Friends,</HI> that they watch against all vexatious and trifling causes of difference; and not, for any such cause, implead, or commence suits of law, upon the encouragement of this <HI>solemn affirmation,</HI> for that would certainly be a perverting the good design of the government, in the granting thereof, and must be deemed a great <HI>misuse</HI> of this privilege.</P>
<P>Secondly, That there be no abuses thereof committed, we do, in like manner, entreat and desire, that Friends may be exhorted and ad∣vised, when any just and valuable occasion doth require any to make use of this <HI>affirmation,</HI> that such <HI>Friend,</HI> or <HI>Friends,</HI> be very considerate, and sure of the truth of what they are about to <HI>affirm;</HI> for where property, or liberty are concerned, a false or corrupt evidence in very injurious, and may prove destructive; beside, it ought, on all occasions, to be re∣membered, that, <HI>a false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape;</HI> and that the command, <HI>thou shalt not bear false witness,</HI> is as well in the gospel as in the law; and that <HI>all liars shall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimstone.</HI> To these inward obligations, on the conscience, to truth-speaking, there is also added the outward guard of pains, penalties and forfeitures, to be inflicted on such as shall lawfully be convicted of wilful and corrupt perjury.</P>
<P>We cannot omit also to remind you, that should any, under our name, so far depart from the righteous law of God, as herein to become guilty, they will thereby contract to themselves perpetual infamy, and to the body, whereof they may pretend to be members, very great scan∣dal and reproach; and such instances repeated might provoke the govern∣ment to deprive us of this great benefit; how great would be the load of guilt on any, who should be the occasion thereof!</P>
<P>Let it be also considered, that the ground of our petitioning and soliciting this further case and relief, was a conscientious scruple, <HI>to swear at all,</HI> at the same time to be guilty of <HI>false affirming,</HI> and while they pre∣tend to great degrees of purity, to fall short in common honesty! It is indeed among the highest degrees of hypocrisy, a crime abhorred by God and man! &amp;c.</P>
<P>To all these particulars (several of them being here omitted) we think it necessary to add, and very earnestly and tenderly to recommend to all <HI>Friends,</HI> that, as much as may be, they do avoid all disputes and differences, with their neighbours; and, as much as possible, <HI>follow peace with all men;</HI> and, in a particular manner, we do press, that all disputes and differences, between <HI>Friends,</HI> be avoided; or, if any do hap∣pen, that earnest endeavours be used, by accommodation, or equitable and impartial reference, to end them, without going to law; that so the rebuke of the apostle may not necessarily be applied to any, <HI>"Now, therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law with one ano∣ther."</HI></P>
<P>Dear Friends, these things, in Christian concern of mind, we have represented, in order that all may be stirred up to a humble and faithful walking, not, as knowing that any will fall short, in the above particu∣lars, but, beloved, <HI>we are persuaded better things of you; and things that accompany salvation, though thus we speak.</HI></P>

<P>That the principal part of those, who accom∣panied our said Proprietor, in his first settlement of this colony, with others of the same profession, who have since retired into it, justly conceived, that, by virtue of said powers, granted to our Proprietor, they should have a free and unques∣tioned right to the exercise of their religious prin∣ciples, and their persuasion, in the aforementioned point, and all others, by which they were distin∣guished from those of other professions; and it seems not unreasonable to conceive an indulgence intended by the crown, in graciously leaving the modelling of the government to him and them, in such manner, as may best suit their circum∣stances; which appears to have been an early care in the first Legislators, by several acts, as that for liberty of conscience; and more particularly, by a law of the province, passed in the 13th year of king <HI>William,</HI> chap. xcii, now in force: it is pro∣vided that, in all courts, all persons, of all per∣suasions, may freely appear, <HI>in their own way,</HI> and, <HI>according to their own manner,</HI> and there personally plead their own cause, or, if unable, by their <HI>friends;</HI> which provision appears to be directly intended to guard against all exceptions to any persons appearing <HI>in their own way,</HI> as our <HI>friend</HI> did, at the aforesaid court.</P>
<P>Now, though no people can be more ready, or willing, in all things essential, to pay all due regard to superiors, and honour the courts of jus∣tice, and those who administer it, yet, in such points as interfere with our conscientious persua∣sion, we have openly and firmly borne our testi∣mony, in all countries and places, where our lots have fallen.</P>

<P>Governor <HI>Keith,</HI> by his popular behaviour and administration, which, in many cases, had been highly beneficial to the province, had so far inte∣rested himself in the favour of many of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith much in favour with the people.</NOTE> that upon intelligence of his intended removal from the government, by the Proprietary family, they were much displeased, and petitioned the Assembly to make him a gratuity: they, even, after his re∣moval, chose him for a Member of Assembly, and he accepted the office.</P>

insomuch that about this time, the author of a publication, called by <HI>Anderson,</HI> in his <HI>historical deduction of commerce,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>a judicious tract,</HI> enti∣tled, <HI>"The importance of the British plantations in America to these kingdoms,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>considered," Lon∣don,</HI> printed, 1731, speaks thus therein of this province, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"That <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> which has not any peculiar staple, (like <HI>Carolina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Pennsylva∣nia about this time.</NOTE> <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI>) and was begun to be planted so late as 1680, should, at present, have more white inhabitants in it, than all <HI>Virginia, Maryland</HI> and both the <HI>Carolinas,</HI> is extremely remarkable! And although the young∣est colony, on the continent," [Georgia, &amp;c. was not yet planted] "they have, by far, the finest capital city of all <HI>British America;</HI> and the second in magnitude. The causes usually assigned for this vast increase of <HI>white people,</HI> in so short a time, are these, <HI>viz.</HI> first, their kind treatment of the <HI>Indians,</HI> their neighbours; here∣by rendering that province absolutely safe from their attempts. Some, indeed, have gone so far, as to assert, that they are the only <HI>British</HI> colony that have treated the poor native <HI>Indians</HI> with hu∣manity: for, that no other <HI>British</HI> colony admits of the evidence of an <HI>Indian</HI> against <HI>a white man:</HI> nor are the complaints of <HI>Indians</HI> against <HI>white men</HI> duly regarded, in other colonies; whereby these poor people endure the most cruel treatment, from the very worst of our own people, without hope of redress! And all the <HI>Indian</HI> wars, in our colonies, were occasioned by such means.

<P>Our long and ardent desires to see one of our honourable Proprietaries amongst us, are now fulfilled; and it is with pleasure we can say thou art arrived at a time, when the government is in perfect tranquillity; and that there seems to be no emulation amongst us, but who shall, by a peace∣able and dutiful behaviour, give the best proof of the sense, they have of the blessings, derived to us, under our late honourable Proprietary your father, whose goodness, to his people, deserves ever to be remembered with <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>affection.</HI></P>
<P>Be pleased to accept of our best wishes for thy health and prosperity; and give us leave to say, as no discouragements, nor any artifices of ill men, have hitherto been able to deter the good people of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> from a firm adherence to your honourable family, so we shall always, to the utmost of our power, support and maintain that government, under which we do, with all gratitude, acknowledge, we enjoy so many valu∣able privileges.</P>

<P>"As the controversy of long standing, concerning the boundaries, between Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and the <HI>Penns</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> has made much noise; we shall insert a short abstract of the same, for the amu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment of the curious."</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s royal grant of <HI>Maryland</HI> was about 50 years prior to Mr. <HI>Penn</HI>'s grant of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> but in <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s grant there was an exception of lands belonging to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which are, at present, the three lower counties upon <HI>Delaware</HI> river; when Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> took posses∣sion, he found one <HI>Dutch</HI> and three <HI>Swedes</HI> congregations.</P>
<P>The grand dispute was concerning the construction of the expression 40 degrees of latitude; <HI>Maryland</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rant 1632 says, <HI>to the 40th degree of latitude,</HI> which the <HI>Maryland</HI> side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> construe to be, to 40 degrees compleat; <HI>Pennsylva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grant, 1681, says, <HI>to begin at the beginning of the 40th degree,</HI> which the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> side construe to be just after the 39th degree is compleated; thus there was a dispute of the extent of one degree of latitude, or 69 <HI>English</HI> miles.</P>
<P>"Considering that <HI>Maryland</HI> grant was prior, and that the <HI>Maryland</HI> people had made considerable improvements by possessions, within that degree of latitude, the affair was compromised seemingly in favour of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by a written agreement, May 10th 1732, "and that, in two calendar months from that date, each party should appoint commissioners, not more than seven, whereof three or more, of each side, may act, or mark out the boundaries aforesaid, to begin, at furthest, sometime in October 1732, and to be completed on, or before, 25th December, 1733, and when so done, a plan thereof shall be signed, sealed and delivered by the commissioners and their principals, and shall be entered in all the public offices in the several provinces and counties; and to recommend, to the respective Legislatures, to pass an act for perambulating these boun∣daries, at least once in three years.</P>
<P>"The party defaulting to pay to the other party, on demand, <HI>six thousand pounds</HI> sterling; accordingly the commissioners respectively ap∣peared; but, upon some differences, in opinion, the boundaries were not made in the time limited; the failure was in Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s side, who alledged, that he had been deceived in fixing cape <HI>Henlopen</HI> 20 miles south westerly of the western cape of <HI>Delaware</HI> bay; whereas cape <HI>Hen∣lopen</HI> is the western cape itself; the <HI>Penns</HI> affirm that the western cape is cape <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and cape <HI>Henlopen</HI> is about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miles southwardly of it, according to the <HI>Dutch</HI> maps, and descriptions, published about the time, when Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> obtained his grant.</P>
<P>"Because of non-performance, the <HI>Penns,</HI> 1735, exhibited a bill, in the <HI>chancery</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> against Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> praying that the said articles may be decreed to subsist, and be carried into execution, and that any doubts arisen may be cleared by said decree.</P>
<P>"After tedious delays, at length, May 15, 1750, the Lord Chancellor decreed costs of suit against <HI>Baltimore,</HI> and that the articles of May 10th 1732, be carried into execution; and that before the end of three calen∣dar months, from May 15th, two several proper instruments, for appoint∣ing commissioners, not more than seven of a side; any three, or more, of a side, may run and mark the boundaries, to begin sometime in No∣vember next, and to be completed on, or before, the last day of April, 1752, to be signed, &amp;c. recorded, &amp;c. and enacted, &amp;c. as per agree∣ment of 1732, above related.</P>
<P>"Lord Chancellor decreed concerning the late disputes, 1. That the centre of the circle be fixed in the middle of the town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> 2. That the said circle ought to be a radius of 12 <HI>English</HI> miles. 3. That cape <HI>Henlopen</HI> ought to be deemed at the place, laid down in the maps annexed to the articles of 1732.</P>
<P>"The commissioners, appointed by each party, met at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> No∣vember 15, 1750; they agreed on a centre in <HI>Newcastle,</HI> from whence the 12 miles radii are to proceed; but a dispute arose concerning the mensuration of these 12 miles. Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s commissioners alledged that these miles ought to be measured superficially; the <HI>Penns'</HI> commissi∣oners alledged, that, considering the various <HI>inequalities</HI> of the ground, such radii could not extend equally, consequently, from them no true arch of a circle could be formed, and insisted upon geometrical and astronomical mensuration: thus the proceedings of the commissioners stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and they wrote to their respective principals for further instruc∣tions, relating to that point, and adjourned to April 25, 1751.</P>

<P><PB N="210" REF="034421_0210_0FFD9FE4482F98A8"/>That from the western end of the said east and west line, in the middle of the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> a strait line shall run northward, up the said <HI>Peninsula,</HI> till it touch the western part of the periphery, or arch, of a circle, drawn twelve <HI>English</HI> statute miles distant from Newcastle, westward towards <HI>Maryland,</HI> so as to make a tangent thereto, and there the said strait line shall end.</P>
<P>That from the northern end of the last menti∣oned strait line, drawn northward, a line shall be continued due north, so far as to that parallel of latitude, which is fifteen English statute miles due south of the most southern part of the city of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

<P>All which lines to be the boundaries between the respective provinces of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and <HI>Pennsyl∣vania,</HI> including the territories of the latter.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this agreement, the perform∣ance was long delayed, or obstructed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boundaries not finally finished till 1762, &amp;c.</NOTE> by alterca∣tion, or disputes, between the parties, about the mode of doing it, said to have been occasioned principally by the Proprietary of <HI>Maryland:</HI> in consequence of which the inhabitants on the <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> side, near where the boundary line ought long before to have been ascertained and marked out, were sometimes exposed to unreasonable de∣mands from <HI>Maryland</HI> claims, and disagreeable, or ill treatment of that government, for want of the same: for it was not finally executed till the year, 1762; when these families, or Proprietaries, agreed to employ two ingenious mathematicians, <HI>Charles Mason,</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah Dixon,</HI> after their return from the cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> where they had been to observe the transit of <HI>Venus,</HI> in the year 1761, finally to settle, or mark out the same; which was accordingly performed by them; and stone pil∣lars erected, to render the same more durably conspicuous.</P>

<PB N="217" REF="034421_0217_0FFDA02DF0FAB628"/>
and prosperity of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in these times, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"I would beg leave to observe to you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of Andrew Hamilton's last speech to the As∣sembly, on the causes of Penn∣sylvania's prosperity, &amp;c.</NOTE> that it is not to the fertility of our soil, and the commo∣diousness of our rivers, that we ought chiefly to attribute the great progress, this province has made, within so small a compass of years, in im∣provements, wealth, trade, and navigation, and the extraordinary increase of people, who have been drawn hither, from almost every country in <HI>Europe;</HI> a progress, which much more ancient settlements, on the main of <HI>America,</HI> cannot, at present, boast of; no, it is principally, and almost wholly, owing to the excellency of our constitu∣tion; under which we enjoy a greater share both of civil and religious liberty than any of our neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>"It is our great happiness, that, instead of triennial Assemblies, a privilege, which several other colonies have long endeavoured to obtain, ours are annual; and, for that reason, as well as others, less liable to be practised upon, or cor∣rupted, either with money or presents. We sit upon our own adjournments, when we please, and as long as we think necessary; and we are not to be sent a packing, in the middle of a debate, and disabled from representing our just grievances to our gracious sovereign, if there should be oc∣casion; which has often been the fate of Assem∣blies in other places.</P>
<P>"We have no officers, but what are necessary; none but what earn their salaries, and those gene∣rally are either elected by the people, or appointed by their representatives.</P>
<P>"Other provinces swarm with unnecessary of∣ficers, nominated by the Governors; who often make it a main part of their care to support those officers, (notwithstanding their oppressions) at all
<PB N="218" REF="034421_0218_0FFD9FC549DE13C8"/>
events. I hope it will ever be the wisdom of our As∣semblies to create no great offices nor officers, nor indeed any officer at all, but what is really neces∣sary for the service of the country, and to be sure to let the people, or their representatives, have, at least, a share in their nomination, or appoint∣ment. This will always be a good security against the mischievous influence of men holding places at the pleasure of the Governor.</P>
<P>"Our foreign trade and shipping are free from all imposts, except those small duties, payable to his majesty, by the statute laws of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The taxes which we pay, for carrying on the public service, are inconsiderable; for the sole power of raising and disposing of the public mo∣ney for the support of government, is lodged in the Assembly; who appoint their own Treasurer; and to them alone he is accountable. Other inci∣dental taxes are assessed, collected and applied by persons annually chosen by the people themselves. Such is our happy state, as to our civil rights.</P>
<P>"Nor are we less happy, in the enjoyment of a perfect freedom, as to religion. By many years experience we find, that an equality among religious societies, without distinguishing any one sect with greater privileges than another, is the most effectual method to discourage hypocrisy, promote the practice of the moral virtues, and pre∣vent the plagues and mischiefs, that always attend religious squabbling.</P>
<P>"This is our constitution; and this constitution was framed by the wisdom of Mr. <HI>Penn,</HI> the first Proprietary and Founder of this province; whose charter of privileges, to the inhabitants of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> will ever remain a monument of his be∣nevolence to mankind, and reflect more lasting honour on his descendants, than the largest pos∣sessions. In the framing this government, he re∣served no powers to himself, or his heirs, to op∣press
<PB N="219" REF="034421_0219_0FFD9FC757714FF0"/>
the people, no authority, but what is neces∣sary for our protection, and to hinder us from falling into anarchy; and therefore (supposing we could persuade ourselves, that all our obligations to our great lawgiver, and his honourable descend∣ants, were entirely cancelled, yet) our own inte∣rests should oblige us carefully to support the go∣vernment, on its present foundation, as the only means to secure to ourselves and our posterity, the enjoyment of those privileges, and the blessings flowing from such a constitution, under which we cannot fail of being happy, if the fault is not our own.</P>
<P>"Yet I have observed, that, in former Assem∣blies there have been men, who have acted in such a manner, as if they utterly disregarded all those inestimable privileges, and (whether from private pique and personal dislike, or through mis∣take, I will not determine) have gone great lengths in risking our happiness, in the prosecution of such measures, as did not at all square with the profes∣sions, they frequently made, of their love to our government.</P>
<P>"When I reflect on the several struggles, which many of us, now present, have had with those men, in order to rescue the constitution out of their hands, which, through their mistakes (if they really were mistakes) was often brought on the brink of de∣struction, I cannot help cautioning you, in the most earnest manner, against all personal animo∣sity, in public consultations, as a rock, which, if not avoided, the constitution will, at some time or other, infallibly split upon."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Andrew Hamilton, Esquire, of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> died in the latter end of the summer 1741. He had served in several considerable stations both in the government of Pennsylvania, and the lower counties, with honour, integrity and ability.

And, as you are endued with a sufficient portion of understanding, to know what offences are <HI>representable</HI> by you, I shall not enumerate them; having al∣ready said, they are generally under your notice; but shall rather recom∣mend to you, and your successors, a steady care, both for the security of the innocent (for by you malicious prosecutions may be cropped in bad) and for bringing offenders to the justice of the law; that by their public shame and suffering, they and others may be deterred from the like of∣fences, for the future.</P><P>"The office of a civil Magistrate, or Justice of the Peace, is an office of high trust, and ought to be executed with great care, circumspection, and good conscience. Magistrates may be looked upon as Ministers un∣der <HI>God,</HI> invested with some branches of power, for the public benefit, <HI>viz.</HI> To be a terror and scourge to <HI>evil doers,</HI> and a praise to them who <HI>do well;</HI> and while they lead lives exemplary of this, and in their public actions, have this principally in view, distributing justice impartially, with clean hands and pure hearts, their post is truly honourable, and they are highly worthy of regard. But if they unhappily deviate from this rule, if they are found in the practice of those crimes, which they ought to punish and suppress, if they pervert justice for bribes, and op∣press the poor and innocent, they, therefore render themselves highly unworthy of an office of so great a trust.</P><P>"I was always a friend to power, well knowing that good and whole∣some laws, duly executed, are so far from being a restraint upon true liberty, that they are only as regulating springs to the passions, and pro∣ductive of it; and our worthy Founder, and first Proprietor tells us, <HI>"That he composed his frame of government with a view to support power in reverence with the people, and to secure the people from the abuse of power:"</HI> and these two are generally observed to attend each other, as causes and their effects. And a noted professor of the law, in this province, some years ago, when he espoused the cause of liberty, and loaded with age and infirmities, took a long journey in defence of it, has these words on power; <HI>"It may justly be compared to a great river, which, while kept within due bounds, is both beautiful and useful; but when it overflows its banks, it is then too impetuous to be stemmed; it bears down all before it, and brings destruc∣tion and desolation where it comes."</HI></P><P>"If, then, these are the ill effects of lawless power, every wise man ought to be on his guard, to prevent them, by keeping up the banks of liberty, and common right, the only bulwark against it.</P><P>"It was in defence and support of this great bulwark, against the at∣tempts of power, under a pretence of serving his majesty, but done in such a manner as, I apprehend, cannot be supposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever intended, or expected, by our most gracious sovereign; whose distinguishing cha∣racter is, to protect and not to oppress; and whatever burden the ne∣cessity of the times requires to be laid on the subjects under his immedi∣ate and just administration, is laid equally and impartially; I say, it was to the opposition, given by the House of <HI>Representatives,</HI> to the manner, in which these attempts were made, and the just concern and dislike shew∣ed thereto, that we may impute the late changes, made in the commis∣sions of the peace, throughout the province, whatever other pretences they may be glossed with.</P><P>"For this cause, my friends and country-men, for the cause of <HI>En∣glish liberty,</HI> for standing in the civil defence of right and property, are we dismissed; and I rejoice, and am heartily glad, that I have been one of those, who are thought worthy of displeasure.</P><P>"And now, to conclude, I take my leave, in the words of a Judge in <HI>Israel, "Here I am, witness against me; whom have I defrauded; whom have I oppressed; or, of whose hands have I received any bribe, to blind my eyes therewith? And I will restore it."</HI></P><P>"May the Prince of Peace, who is the King of kings, protect the people of this province, from domestic foes and foreign enemies! is my hearty desire; and so I hid you all farewell."</P><P>Respecting this same <HI>John Wright,</HI> it may be further observed, in this place, that he died about the year 1751, in <HI>Lancaster</HI> county, where he had lived, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.</P><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorial of John Wright.</NOTE>It is recorded of him, "That he was born in the year 1667, in <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> of religious and reputable parents; who were among the early professors of the doctrines held by the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and lived and died highly esteemed members of that community.

In his station as a Judge, for the last county, he was noted for a prompt, honest plainness, and candour, and an inflexible in∣tegrity; one instance of which appears in the cause and manner of his dismission from that office, in 1741, as above mentioned.</P><P>"He continued to attend the Assemblies, till broken health, and an advanced age, rendered such attendance difficult, and sometimes impracti∣cable; although the people among whom he lived, from a long experi∣ence of his services, and regard to him, would not be prevailed on by himself, or his family, to name another in his stead, for that station; but continued to return his name till he died.</P><P>"Through every station in life, his good will to mankind, his love of peace and good order, and his endeavours to give them a permanent footing, in his neighbourhood, and in the country, in general, were known to be his delight and study: his sense of religion, and the testi∣mony he bore to it, were free from intemperate zeal, yet earnest, and attended with life and spirit, influenced by the love of God, and bene∣volence to his whole creation; such he continued, with his understanding clear, his mind calm, chearful and resigned, to the advanced period of old age, when he expired without a groan,"</P><P>On the 19th of October, 1742, died <HI>Robert Jordan</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and memorial of Robert Jordan.</NOTE> a person of note, and an eminent preacher, among the <HI>Quakers;</HI> in which service he had travelled much in divers countries: accounts say of him, that he was justly esteemed and beloved, not only by those of his own religious society, but also by others, both of high and low rank, who had the pleasure of his acquaintance: that he was generous in his sentiments, free and communicative, yet very circumspect, in his con∣versation and behaviour; and carried with him through life, the evident characteristics of a good man, and a minister of Christ.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The welfare of the inhabitants of this colony, and that of our Proprietary family, seem to us mutually to depend on each other, and therefore, it is not to be wondered at, that we are so desirous of their residence among us: it being reasonable to think, we are most secure from any attempts on our liberties, when the administration of go∣vernment, and the management of the public af∣fairs of the province, are under the immediate in∣spection of those, whose interest it is to preserve our constitution from any encroachments.</P>

Whatever little differences in opinion may have happened, we hope the Proprietaries will believe the freemen of this province retain that regard, which is due to them; and would be glad of any proper opportu∣nity of demonstrating it: and such is our confi∣dence in the Proprietary family, that, if any at∣tempt shall be made to the prejudice of those rights (which under our gracious king, we now happily enjoy) they will to the utmost of their power, oppose it, and thereby lay us under like obligations for the continuance of those privileges, which we readily own are due to their worthy an∣cestor, for bestowing them.</P>

but he appears never to have been very popular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1742.</NOTE> in the province: he is said, in general, to have conducted himself rather too much reserved to∣wards the people, and too nearly attached to cer∣tain views, for his private interest, in reference to the province; which are things opposite to popu∣larity. Besides, the imprudence of some persons in the province, in order to shew their dislike at some part of his conduct, which did not please them, tended to create and increase a similar disposition, where the contrary ought the more to have been cultivated and cherished; but, in general, he was a person of a worthy character, and of moderate principles.</P>

of infelicity, and the most pernicious evils; even, liberty itself, than which nothing is more desirable, when carried beyond a certain point, degenerates into licentiousness; and, from its effects, pro∣ducing the worst kind of tyranny, is, of all evils, frequently rendered the most destructive to the human race; for, as one beast of prey devours another, so men, whatever refined notions they may otherwise possess, or pretend to, when re∣strained neither by law nor conscience, are more pernicious, and that often to their own species, than the worst of savages, or, even, the most ra∣venous of the brutal kind! It is thus that men originally, by their own actions and depravity, lose that true liberty, to which they would other∣wise be entitled; and the human species is thereby brought into vassalage to their own folly. Too great liberty is the cause of too great restraint up∣on it; and every extreme is the source of the con∣trary; may this never be the case of <HI>Pennsylva∣nia!</HI></P>

Hence, in suc∣ceeding years, certain symptoms of an approach∣ing change, in this valuable blessing, began to grow more and more conspicuous, through the forma∣tion and increase of party, among many of the later inhabitants, joined and instigated by divers others; and, in their elections for Members of Assembly, to foment the spirit of opposition against the <HI>old interest,</HI> and the defenders of the establish∣ed constitution of the province, and the descend∣ants

<P>The most remarkable and unwarrantable in∣stance of this nature, that I find on record,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the riot in 1742, &amp;c.</NOTE> in this province, was this, which I have mentioned, in the year 1742; when a large number of sailors, from the shipping in the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> during the time of election (not being any way interested, or, of right, concerned therein) armed with clubs, suddenly and unexpectedly appeared, in a tumul∣tuous manner, and formed a <HI>riot,</HI> at the place of election, knocking down a great number of the people, both Magistrates, Constables and others, worthy and reputable inhabitants, who opposed them; and, by violence having cleared the ground, several of the people were carried off, as dead!</P>
<P>This was repeatedly done, upon the return of the electors; till, at last, many of the inhabitants, being enraged, took measures to force them into their ships, and near fifty of them into prison; but they were soon discharged:<NOTE PLACE="marg">occasioned by party leaders, &amp;c.</NOTE> for it afterwards appeared, that they had been privately employed, in this work, by some party leaders; it being then in time of war, when consequently party spirit, which is so nearly allied to it, and, in the ex∣treme, ends in the same, was encouraged to make greater efforts, to distract the public proceedings, and under this Governor's administration, by more ways than one, to divert the established form of the constitution, from its <HI>peaceable order and course,</HI> into that of its opposite nature; in which an in∣creasing party here, since that time, though gene∣rally under the most specious and plausible pre∣tences, have ever appeared to take delight: for change is grateful to the human race; and, proba∣bly, no government of mankind is, at all times,

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far appears the manner of the rise, colo∣nization, increase and happy establishment of the flourishing province of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> which, by means of the very remarkable industry, honesty, moderation, and good policy of the first and early colonists and their successors, from a wilderness, became as a fruitful field, and a very valuable and important addition to the British interest in <HI>America,</HI> without any expence to the parent country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This being written about the year 1778 or 1779, in a time of great confusion, contention and uncertainty, in this part of <HI>America,</HI> alludes, in the conclusion, to a probable, or apparent future change, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The enjoyment of that rational freedom of thinking, and religious worship, with a just and equal participation of natural and civil rights, which, in the populousness, and general polity of <HI>Europe,</HI> seemed to be either too much lost, or, at least, too partially distributed, was the compact of settlement; and the restoration and fruition of that peace and tranquillity, which the wickedness and folly of the human race had so much banish∣ed from the world, by the more effectual encou∣ragement and promotion of primitive truth and simplicity, in the actions and manners of men, in a way, that seemed best to those concerned, and so far as the state of human nature would ad∣mit, were the chief views and motives to the un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>That these were the real principles, upon which the constitution and government of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> were primarily founded, it is sufficiently known and manifest, from the best documents, and con∣firmed by a series of most certain facts, as given, though defectively, in the preceding history, and
<PB N="235" REF="034421_0235_0FFD9F9C730324A0"/>
in the following view of the general state of the province, between the years 1760 and 1770: that its great and rapid increase, its happy and flou∣rishing condition since, down to the present time, have been principally owing to the influence of these same principles, in degree still prevailing, future time will further, and more fully demon∣strate, whenever the unhappy reverse thereof shall take place; which now seems to be fast approach∣ing: by whose contrary effects will then still more clearly appear, in contrast, both the cause and means of the extraordinary, and so long continued prosperity, and unparalled felicity, for which this province has been long so justly famed, above all other countries, at least, in <HI>America,</HI> if not in the whole world: a state, in some respect, so nearly resembling that of those <HI>saturnian</HI> times, in <HI>Italy,</HI> which, we are told formerly produced the <HI>golden age,</HI> and so far actually realizing ancient fable, that to its inhabitants, perhaps, before any other people, on the surface of the globe, might parti∣cularly, and with great propriety, have been ap∣plied the exclamation of the poet Virgil,
<Q>"Felices nimium sua si bona norint, Agricolee!"</Q>
as well as that of Milton, respecting the state of the first parents of mankind,
<Q><L>—"and, O! yet happiest, if ye seek</L>
<L>No happier state, and know to know no more."</L></Q></P>
<P>But all things have their time; and both king∣doms and empires, as well as smaller states, and particular persons, must die; <HI>"finis ac ab origine pendet;"</HI> yet folly often shortens their duration, as wisdom and virtue prolong their more happy existence: and we may plainly see men frequently and greedily embrace the former, for the latter, and with great zeal and confidence often pursue their own misery, under a strong persuasion of the contrary: for, as the human body, when in
<PB N="236" REF="034421_0236_0FFDA00B05DEC308"/>
its most plethoric state, and in the greatest appear∣ance of health and vigour, is often then most in danger, or nearest a sudden change, so the late and present extraordinary prosperity, the increa∣sing, flourishing and happy state of this country, at present, above others, may probably be a prog∣nostic, or sign, of its being in a more critical situ∣ation and danger.</P>
<P>For so long as the fatal delusion, which, we are told, originally rendered mankind unhappy, still continues, though in different degrees, and various appearances, to except entirely from its baneful influence no part of the human race, every con∣dition, in this world, will be subject to muta∣bility; but then the remedy has ever been equal to the disease; for the Creator and Supporter of the world, whose peculiar attribute it is, to pro∣duce good out of evil, has placed within the power and choice of mankind, those means of recovery from all evil, which are, at least, adequate to the nature and extent of it; and sometimes places special examples before the eyes of the human race, like this of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to shew them the absolute possibility of a still superior bliss, and more exalted felicity, than is commonly experi∣enced in the world, not only in an individual, but also in a collective, or national, and more universal capacity.</P>

<P>The seasons and temperature of the weather.—Na∣ture of the land and soil, &amp;c.—Face of the coun∣try in general; as the mountains, vallies, plains, rivers, and creeks, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seasons and weather in Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE>THAT greater degree of siccity in the tempe∣rature of the air, which prevails more on conti∣nents, than islands, or smaller tracts of land, sur∣rounded by water, is observable in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> For the weather, round the year, is much dryer here, than in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> notwithstanding the more violent changes, in this country, when they happen. The winters are longer and more severe; the summers hotter and dryer; the springs very short; the autumn long and mild; but notwith∣standing the length and severity of the winters, they are generally more clear, agreeable and heal∣thy, than in <HI>England;</HI> but the summers less so, by reason of their great heat and sudden changes; which cause dysenteries, lingering and putrid fe∣vers, with other dangerous distempers, in the latter part of summer, &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempera∣ture of the air, &amp;c.</NOTE>The temperature of the air, and the nature of the weather, are much governed by the particular and variable winds, which prevail most in the dif∣ferent seasons: some of which have a very remark∣able and sudden influence thereon, especially those in winter; which, during that part of the year, blow more from the west-northerly, than from any other quarter. These winds seldom sail to produce a clear sky, and a remarkable sharp cold, even, in every season of the year: as those from
<PB N="239" REF="034421_0239_0FFDA0348C27ADD8"/>
the south-westerly are distinguished for producing haziness and warmth or heat in summer. But the eastern winds are frequent, and as much observed to bring on haziness, fogs, or clouds, and wet or falling weather, as the former are, for their re∣spective cold and heat, with their peculiar dryness; and they are observed in later years to be more common and prevalent than formerly represented to have been.</P>
<P>Hence that temperature of the seasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extremes of heat and cold, with their cons∣equences, &amp;c.</NOTE> which is more peculiar to the insular, than to the conti∣nental parts of the world, and so remarkable in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is not experienced here, by reason of the heats and colds being more intense, and sudden, often occasioned by the quick and uncer∣tain shifting of the wind; which have a surprising effect on vegetation, and even on animal life itself, both to accelerate, and sometimes increase them, as well as to shorten their duration: for, as the vegetables are drawn up in a rapid manner (like plants under glasses, or in a very warm exposure, in colder climates) by the great and sudden heats, in the beginning of summer; whereby the very ground, more especially that which is higher than the rest, and most exposed to the sun, and parch∣ing dry winds, appears frequently, in a short time, to be exhausted of its virtue and goodness, or deprived of that fructifying quality, which nou∣rishes plants and herbage: so they are often as suddenly cut down by the succeeding frosts, or de∣stroyed by the severe cold, or want of moisture. And notwithstanding the spring commences at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> near a month later than about <HI>London,</HI> yet the harvest in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> is a month earlier than in <HI>England;</HI> which renders that season very short in the former.</P>
<P>Violent gusts of thunder, wind and rain, are frequent in the warm seasons, with sudden cold
<PB N="240" REF="034421_0240_0FFD9FEE26E06C50"/>
after them, and a north west wind; which more often are consequent upon the intense heats. The snows are frequently very deep, in winter, and the frosts so intense, that it has not been very un∣common for the large river <HI>Delaware,</HI> even, where it is near a mile broad, to be frozen over in one night, so as to bear people walking upon the ice in the morning; which river sometimes, in the winter season, for several weeks together, even, opposite to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> is as much frequented with loaded carriages of all sorts, bringing country produce upon the ice to the city, as any part of <HI>terra firma.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thomas Makin, before mentioned, in his <HI>Descriptio Pensilvania,</HI> anno 1729, speaks in the following manner, on the situation and tem∣perature of Pennsylvania, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LG>

Longevity appears mostly in <HI>island countries,</HI> where, with a small latitude, or variation, the temperature of the air continue.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the land and soil, &amp;c.</NOTE>In a province of so large extent as that of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> the nature and quality of the land and soil must consequently be various; yet much more of a similarity, in this respect, runs through the whole of it, at least, so far as at present cultivated, than is to be found in the same extent, any where in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>If the lands be divided into three parts, or kinds, according to the present application, use and suitableness of them, viz. <HI>grazing, arable</HI> and <HI>barren,</HI> or <HI>least useful,</HI> the first is but a very small proportion; and there is not much, that may properly be called very rich, or good grass land, in it (I mean so far as at present improved) when compared with that of some other countries, ex∣cepting near rivers, creeks, and runs of water; where in the vallies, and such low places as are enriched by the floods and washing down of the soil, from the hills and uplands, and longest retain moisture, the land is the most fertile, and com∣monly appropriated to grass: but then these places generally are more unhealthy, being very subject to agues, intermittent and slow fevers, while in the more elevated, poor and barren situations, which are less profitable to the cultivator, the in∣habitants
<PB N="243" REF="034421_0243_0FFDA007E4A90E38"/>
mostly enjoy a clearer air, and better state of health.</P>
<P>The second sort of land, which is far the great∣est part of what is, at present, improved, is rather of a poor, shallow, or middling kind of soil; but, as much of it is of a strong, clayey, or loamy nature, and in some places abounds with limestone, it is mostly very capable of improve∣ment, even after it has been much worn out by bad management, and is, for the most part, very suitable for grain; to which use it is chiefly ap∣plied, so far back in the country as improvement has hitherto advanced.</P>
<P>Of the third kind of land, in the province, which is of very little, or no value, it is difficult to ascertain the quantity; but, in divers places of the more remote and mountainous parts, no small proportion of the land is so broken, stony, rocky, or barren, as to be either from its present situation, not worth improving, or otherwise entirely incapa∣ble of culture; some places scarcely producing any tree, or vegetable, whatever; and others, at best, only those of the most dwarfish, or shrubby kind.</P>
<P><HI>Face of the country, mountains, rivers, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All the land situated south-westward of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s or <HI>North</HI> River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Lewis Evans's analysis, &amp;c</NOTE> to the north boundary of <HI>Caro∣lina,</HI> in latitude 36 ½, may be divided into diffe∣rent and regular stages; in which the first object to be observed, is a remarkable <HI>rief</HI> or <HI>vein</HI> of rocks, of the <HI>talky,</HI> or <HI>isinglass</HI> kind, arising gene∣rally a little higher than the adjoining land, and extending from <HI>New York</HI> city south-westerly, by the lower falls of <HI>Delaware,</HI> at <HI>Trenton;</HI> by those of <HI>Schuylkill,</HI> a little above <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> of <HI>Sus∣quehanna,</HI> a few miles above the head of <HI>Chesapeak</HI> bay; and of <HI>Gunpowder</HI> and <HI>Palapseo</HI> rivers, in <HI>Maryland;</HI> of <HI>Potomack, Rapahannock,</HI> and <HI>James

River,</HI> in <HI>Virginia;</HI> and of <HI>Roanoak</HI> in <HI>North Ca∣rolina.</HI></P>
<P>This is supposed to have been a former mari∣time boundary of this part of <HI>America,</HI> and forms a very regular curve. The land between this <HI>rief</HI> and the sea, from the <HI>Navesink</HI> hills, near <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> in <HI>East Jersey,</HI> south westward along the whole coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lower Plains.</NOTE> may be denominated the <HI>Lower Plains;</HI> which consists of soil, washed down from above, and of sand, accumulated from the ocean.</P>
<P>Where these plains are not penetrated by rivers, they are white sea sand, about twenty feet deep, and entirely barren. But the borders of the ri∣vers, which descend from the <HI>uplands,</HI> are rendered fertile by the soil washed down by the floods, and mixed with the sand, gathered from the sea: the substratum of sea mud, shells, and other foreign subjects, are a sufficient confirmation of this suppo∣sition.</P>
<P>Hence for forty or fifty miles inland from the sea shore, excepting as above, all the space from the <HI>Navesinks</HI> to <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> is entirely barren, where the wash, from the <HI>upland,</HI> has not enriched the borders of the rivers; or where some ponds, or defiles, have not furnished proper support for the growth of white cedars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vein of clay, &amp;c.</NOTE>There is commonly a <HI>vein</HI> of clay seaward of the <HI>Isinglass Rief,</HI> from three to four miles wide; which is a coarse <HI>fuller</HI>'s <HI>earth;</HI> and, with a proper mixture of loam, is excellently well adapted for <HI>bricks:</HI> at, or near, which vein of clay, that part of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> which is nearest the sea, or from about <HI>Trenton,</HI> on <HI>Delaware,</HI> to the borders of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in general commences; and <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI> is partly situated upon it.</P>
<P>From this <HI>rief</HI> of rocks, over which all the ri∣vers fall, (as before mentioned) to that chain of broken hills, commonly called the <HI>South Moun∣tain,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="034421_0245_0FFDA027F71499E8"/>
there is a space of very uneven ground, ex∣tending, in different places, fifty, sixty, or seventy miles, and rising sensibly on advancing further in∣land; which space may be denominated the <HI>upland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The upland &amp;c.</NOTE> This consists of veins of different kinds of soil and substrata, for some scores of miles in length; and, in some places it is overlaid with little chains of hills. The declivity of the whole gives a great rapidity to the streams of water; where the vio∣lent gusts of wind and rain, to which the climate, in hot seasons, is very subject, have washed, or wore, it much into gullies, and carried down the soil, to enrich the borders of the rivers, in the <HI>lower plains.</HI> These steep inequalities render much of the country not easily capable of culture; whereby it is likewise impoverished, by reason of the almost continual washing away of the richer mould, that covers the surface.</P>
<P>The <HI>South Mountain</HI> is not in ridges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South Mountain, &amp;c.</NOTE> like the <HI>Endless Mountains,</HI> so called, but in small, broken, steep, stony hills; nor does it run with so much regularity.

<P>HAVING thus far given a general account of the soil, face of the country, mountains, rivers, &amp;c. besides the geographical description of the province, in respect to its situation and extent, as expressed in the royal charter, and in the dispute between <HI>Penn</HI> and <HI>Baltimore,</HI> in the preceding history, by which its real extent, north and south, appears to be no more than about one hundred and fifty-seven miles, instead of two hundred and eight, as intended by charter, and about two hundred and sixty east and west, it may be proper, in the next place, to exhibit a sketch of the di∣visions, into which the settled or improved and located part of it is formed, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The other three are frontier counties, in the back parts of the province, next the <HI>Indians:</HI> they were laid out but very lately, and, as yet, are but thinly inhabited, and little improved, be∣ing the most remote from the capital of the pro∣vince.</P>
<P>The natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Produce of Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE> or original produce of <HI>Pennsylva∣nia,</HI> in regard to animals and vegetables, or trees and fruits, as well as the original inhabitants, &amp;c. has already, in part, been mentioned, in <HI>William Penn</HI>'s account of them, in the preceding history: <HI>maize,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> corn, is an original; and <HI>straw∣berries,</HI> with <HI>grapes,</HI> of various kinds, grow natu∣ral in the woods, as well as <HI>mulberries,</HI> &amp;c. Deer, among the quadrupeds, and wild turkeys, among the winged tribe, were formerly very plentiful, but now scarce, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But most kinds of <HI>European</HI> grain and fruits, as well as domestic, or tame animals, have been naturalized here; some of the fruits have been meliorated by the change, while others degene∣rate.

<P>The ground abounds with <HI>iron ore,</HI> in many places, as well as with <HI>marble</HI> and <HI>limestone,</HI> &amp;c. in others; from the former of which, great quan∣tities of pig and bar iron, castings, &amp;c. are made both for exportation and home use.

Other grain, as barley, oats, &amp;c. being here mostly of inferior quality to those of some other parts of the world, are more seldom raised in very considerable quantity, in this province: <HI>Indian corn</HI> and <HI>buck-wheat</HI> supplying the use of these in divers respects.</P>
<P>The country abounds with excellent mills, turned by water, for various purposes, but chiefly for grinding of grain; for which it is well adapted, by reason of its uneven surface, many hills, rivu∣lets, or creeks, so that generally more flour and bread, in latter years, have been exported from hence, than wheat, or grain, unmanufactured: besides, the quantity of flaxseed annually raised here, and shipped to <HI>Ireland,</HI> has been very con∣siderable; as well as that of <HI>barrelled pork,</HI> to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and other markets, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The present inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants.</NOTE> exclu∣sive of the few <HI>Indians,</HI> still remaining in the re∣mote, or back parts, of it, consist mostly of such people as have removed thither from <HI>Europe,</HI> and of their descendants; and still many of them have connections there; hence they are generally in the practice of the customs and manners of the different countries, from which they originally came, according to their rank in life. Of those which constitute the different religious societies, such as appear to be least known, and most re∣markable, either have been already, or will here∣after, be mentioned in the proper place.</P>
<P>Besides the great numbers of the first and early colonists, as well as since, from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the large importations of people from <HI>Ireland</HI> into this province, both in early and latter times, those from <HI>Germany</HI> have been so great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Germans, &amp;c.</NOTE> that it is supposed near one-third, at least, of the inhabi∣tants, at this time, consists of the last, and their descendants: the counties of <HI>Lancaster, York, Berks,</HI> and <HI>Northampton</HI> being principally settled by them, and they are very numerous, even, in the city and county of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as well as in the others.</P>
<P>In the summer of the year 1749, twenty-five sail of large ships arrived with <HI>German</HI> passengers alone: which brought about twelve thousand souls, some of the ships about six hundred each; and in several other years near the same number of these people arrived annually; and in some years near as many annually from <HI>Ireland.</HI> By an exact ac∣count of all the ships and passengers annually,
<PB N="274" REF="034421_0274_0FFD9FDA0AB97FA8"/>
which have arrived at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with <HI>Germans</HI> alone, nearly from the first settlement of the pro∣vince, till about the year 1776, when their im∣portation ceased, the number of the latter appears to be about thirty-nine thousand; and their inter∣nal increase has been very great. <HI>Cumberland</HI> county is mostly settled by the <HI>Irish,</HI> who abound through the whole province. The <HI>Germans</HI> seem more adapted for agriculture, and the improvement of a wilderness, and the <HI>Irish</HI> for trade, &amp;c. The former soon get estates in this country, where in∣dustry and parsimony are the chief requisites to procure them, &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negroes.</NOTE>The <HI>Negroes,</HI> or black people, it is supposed, are less numerous in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI> than in most of the other colonies, in proportion to the number of other inhabitants; the Legisla∣ture, at different times, having used the best en∣deavours in their power, to discourage and pre∣vent the impolitic and inhuman practice of the introduction or importation, of them; a practice, which has long prevailed in this part of the world, both in its nature and manner, not only the great opprobrium of Christianity, but even the shameful disgrace of human nature itself!</P>
<P>But there is another class of people, whose numbers here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refuse of other coun∣tries, &amp;c.</NOTE> in latter years, have annually so much increased as apparently to portend conse∣quences no less dangerous and unhappy to the public good, in some respects, than those last mentioned, as they are more capable of it, and those very consequences manifestly a present ad∣vantage to them; I mean such as flee from justice, in other countries, and convicts from <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> who frequently find the way hither, after they are landed in other places, to the no small detriment of the honest part of the community; besides the dangerous consequences,
<PB N="275" REF="034421_0275_0FFD9FA8DA6D84A8"/>
which may justly be dreaded from so large, and long continued collection of such kind of people together; which at present seems to demand the public attention more than it has done.</P>
<P>About the year 1759, or sometime before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of inhabitants, &amp;c.</NOTE> the number of families in the province was computed at twenty thousand, by a very moderate computa∣tion;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See <HI>"An historical review of the constitution and government of Penn∣sylvania,"</HI> &amp;c.

<P>The houses are mostly built of brick, and co∣vered with shingles of cedar, very uniform, plain and neat; though both good marble, and other stone, are procured, within fifteen miles from the city, by water carriage, and by land near the same distance.

</TABLE></P><P><HI>Note.</HI> Above a year before the last period, building in Philadelphia, by reason of a particular circumstance, being interrupted, had entirely ceased.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>As to the original plan of the city, which has already been described in another place, though most of it is still retained in the late improvements, yet, in some parts of it, the intention of the great Founder is said to be departed from; and it is too much cut up into small and confined spaces, by narrow lanes and alleys,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some nui∣sances, in∣convenien∣ces, and abuses, &amp;c.</NOTE> not suitable for the heat of the climate, nor proper for the health of the in∣habitants; for the benefit of whom, in crowded ci∣ties, as much free and open air is requisite as can possibly be obtained. Besides, along the water side, where there ought to be a wide public street, or quay, continued the whole front of the city, for the free and uninterrupted use of the citizens; be∣sides wharves, extending further into the water, and other convenient space, for shipping and landing of merchandize, and properly accomodating the general trade, &amp;c. private persons are permitted to build and place obstructions close to the ri∣ver. Add to these, the principal street in the city is shamefully obstructed by a <HI>court-house</HI> in the middle of the most crowded part of it, and by other buildings erected for butchers shambles, and holding a market; now long experienced to be the most inconvenient and improper place that could be appropriated for that purpose in such a crowded and increasing city, as well as contrary
<PB N="279" REF="034421_0279_0FFDA057E411D360"/>
to the original intention, which designed all the pub∣lic streets for high ways without obstruction, or in∣terruption; though in early time, it might have been otherwise, in regard to conveniency, when the place was small, and the people few. These in∣conveniences, and abuses, not to say public nui∣sances, and impediments to the salubrity of the city, with their growing consequences, if it con∣tinues to increase as it has done, and they not re∣moved, and better provision made, future time will indoubtedly be more sensible of.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The health and conveniency of large cities are of the greatest im∣portance, and above all calculation of expence, &amp;c. An enlargement of the limits of this city north and south, with a more proper division into regular wards, for its better government and regulation, merit public attention▪ and a further provision of suitable and convenient open and vacant spaces of ground for public buildings, market places, grave yards, public, spacious, airy walks planted with trees and fenced in, and pro∣tected from all nuisances, in every part of the city-plan and vicinity, for the greater conveniency and healthiness of the people, are among the further improvements to be wished for:—too much neglected in early time, as well as in later years, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The public buildings in this city, at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Public buildings, &amp;c.</NOTE> are mostly plain, yet some of them elegant; but, in general, they are adapted more for real use and conveniency, than ornament. The <HI>state-house,</HI> where the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> and <HI>Supreme Court,</HI> of the province, are held, is a plain, but elegant and spacious edifice, for the time in which it was built, about the year 1732: it stands on the south side of <HI>Chesnut-street;</HI> and with its wings and ap∣pendages, on each side of it, occupies the whole extent of a square of near four hundred feet, be∣tween <HI>Fifth</HI> and <HI>Sixth-streets</HI> from <HI>Delaware.</HI> The <HI>prison</HI> and <HI>work house,</HI> at the corner of <HI>High-street</HI> and <HI>Third-street,</HI> are strong and spacious buildings, but have nothing very remarkable in their archi∣tecture.</P>
<P>Of houses for worship, that of the <HI>Episcopalians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses of worship.</NOTE> or <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Second-street,</HI> called <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Church,</HI> is looked upon as the most ele∣gant;

the rest are generally more adapted for use and conveniency, than shew. The <HI>Quakers</HI> have four houses for public worship in the city; of which they constantly, at the appointed times for worship, occupy three; the fourth is used on par∣ticular occasions. The <HI>Episcopalians</HI> have three; the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> four; the <HI>Baptists,</HI> one; the <HI>Moravians,</HI> one; the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> two; the <HI>Methodists,</HI> one; the <HI>German Lutherans,</HI> two; and the <HI>German Calvinists,</HI> one; likewise the <HI>Swedish Lutherans,</HI> one, in the lower suburbs, at <HI>Wicocoa.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Schools and seminaries of learning, &amp;c.</NOTE>Besides the numerous private <HI>schools,</HI> for the education of youth, in this city, there are two public <HI>seminaries</HI> of learning, incorporated by char∣ter, and provided with funds; the first, in order of time, is that of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> already mentioned in another place; incorporated by the first Pro∣prietor, <HI>William Penn;</HI> the corporation consists of fifteen persons, chosen by themselves; they have their monthly meetings, for the care and management of the institution; and their regular visitations of the various schools, under their di∣rection and notice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Quakers</HI> have one school in the city besides these under their care, at their sole expence, for teaching <HI>Negro children</HI> only.</NOTE></P>
<P>Besides the schools in other parts of the city and county of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> under their care, they have a convenient and handsome building, ele∣gantly situated, in the east side of <HI>Fourth-street,</HI> near <HI>Chesnut-street;</HI> where, besides <HI>reading</HI> and <HI>writing,</HI> are taught <HI>grammar</HI> and the <HI>languages,</HI> with the most useful parts of <HI>mathematical</HI> learning, in different apartments, under their proper masters; where also is kept a library, for the use of the institution: but this seminary, in some respects, has not been improved, or advanced, according to the original intention, or to as great utility as it is capable of.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="034421_0281_0FFD9F860FD1BA78"/>The second is the <HI>College</HI> and <HI>Academy</HI> of <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> of a much later standing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">College and Academy of Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> and not existing as such, before the year 1749; but greatly im∣proved of late years; and is likely, if its present prudent management be continued, to become hereafter, the most considerable of the kind, per∣haps, in <HI>British America:</HI> the corporation consists of twenty-four members, called <HI>Trustees;</HI> they have a large commodious building, on the west side of <HI>Fourth-street,</HI> near <HI>Mulberry-street,</HI> where the different branches of learning and science are taught, in the various parts of the institution.</P>

<P><HI>Germantown,</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> county, about six miles north of the city, with which it is nearly coeval, and noted for its manufacture of <HI>stockings,</HI> by the <HI>German</HI> settlers and their descendants, who principally inhabit it, consists chiefly of one street, several miles in length, different parts of it ha∣ving different names, irregularly built of stone, dug out of the ground where the houses stand; in a high and healthy situation, with distances, or vacant spaces, in some places, between the houses; it affords a pleasant retreat in summer to divers inhabitants of Philadelphia; and contains more houses and people than any other town in the province, Philadelphia and Lancaster excepted.</P>

<P>The nature and manner of the government, by a Governor and provincial Assembly, as expressed in the last charter of privileges, given in the year 1701, with the powers granted to the Proprietary, <HI>William Penn,</HI> in the royal charter of 1681, upon which the former is founded, have already been mentioned, in the preceding history; and, there∣fore, in this place, need no repetition.

<P>The <HI>Assembly,</HI> by charter, is elected on the first day of October annually, by the freeholders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provincial Assembly.</NOTE> in each county.

But the num∣ber of the members, and mode of elections, are fixed, altered and regulated by act of Assembly, pursuant to the powers granted by the said charter. They have for many years, before the last frontier counties were added, or till about the year 1771, consisted of about thirty-six; of which number, the city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> returned two; each of the oldest counties, of <HI>Philadelphia, Bucks</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> eight; that of <HI>Lancaster</HI> four; and the later (and in those times, much thinner inhabited) counties of <HI>York, Cumberland, Berks</HI> and <HI>North∣ampton,</HI> returned the rest.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain∣ty of the origin of the Indians, &amp;c.</NOTE>AS to the origin of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or aboriginal inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI> in general, there is no∣thing on record, but mere modern conjecture; which varies according to the different opinions and fancies of those, who have thought and writ on the subject, and endeavoured to account for the first peopling of that continent. It is, per∣haps, as improbable for a people, who have not the knowledge of letters, to derive their original from those, who were possessed of that useful and necessary science, and not to retain it among them∣selves afterwards, as it would be nugatory to pre∣tend to give an account thereof, without the means, absolutely necessary for that purpose? Therefore, without saying any thing of their ori∣ginal,
<PB N="293" REF="034421_0293_0FFD9FB3139317D8"/>
or troubling the reader with conjectures, how this country first began to be inhabited by mankind, let it suffice here to observe, in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Probably a different species of mankind.</NOTE> that these people appear to form a distinct species of the human race, as well as the <HI>Negroes,</HI> and some other kinds of people, in the world: this is so manifestly visible, from an entire uniformity, among them, of certain marks and characters, peculiar to their persons and features, that they are thereby as sufficiently distinguished from all the rest of mankind, into a different, or distinct species, or variety, of rational beings, as the va∣rious species of some of the particular <HI>genera</HI> of the irrational animals and plants are characterized by their respective and peculiar properties and phenomena.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Douglas</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> in his summary, &amp;c. says, "The <HI>American</HI> aboriginal <HI>Indians</HI> are <HI>impubes</HI> and <HI>imberbes,"</HI> &amp;c. This is asserted by many others; but however it may be in regard to some of that people, later observation assures us, that this is not the case, at least, with all of them.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> called the <HI>Six Nations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Six Na∣tions, &amp;c.</NOTE> have held sovereignty over all the <HI>Indians,</HI> both in this and the neighbouring provinces, for a long series of years; and as a similarity of their customs pre∣vails much among those, who are subject to them, so previous to an account of the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI> as they were found and observed by the first and early <HI>European</HI> or <HI>English</HI> settlers among them, whose description or obser∣vation, may be most depended on, as nearest the truth, it may be proper to say something further respecting these nations, though they have not, at present, their residence within the limits of these provinces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nations</HI> first entered into an alliance with the <HI>English,</HI> on the capture of <HI>New York</HI> from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in 1664; which has remarkably continued ever since. The limits of their lands, or country, included all the nations and tribes,
<PB N="294" REF="034421_0294_0FFDA02065149978"/>
which were subject to them, either by conquest, of otherwise; they extended from the south part of lake <HI>Champlain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of their terri∣tories, &amp;c.</NOTE> in latitude 44°, on the north of <HI>New York</HI> government, to the borders of <HI>Carolina,</HI> in latitude 36°, comprehending all <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and the adjacent countries. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> themselves are seated between the 42d and 43d degree of north latitude, north eastward of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> within the bounds of <HI>New York</HI> govern∣ment, and on the rivers which run into lake <HI>On∣tario.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of bounding their coun∣tries.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> generally bound their countries, or territories, by large wide spaces of land, not by lines, or marks. Their numbers are small, in pro∣portion to the land they possess. They fix their towns commonly on the borders of great rivers, on account of the rich lawns, for planting their corn: the intermediate ground they reserve for hunting; which equally serves them for that pur∣pose and a frontier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of naming their nati∣ons and tribes.</NOTE>Their nations and tribes are generally distin∣guished and denominated by the names of the ri∣vers and creeks, or other noted places, of their residence; which original names they commonly still continue to retain after their removal to other places. The tribes, which composed their nations, were frequently in proportion to the number and importance of the creeks, that ran into the rivers which bore their nations. The <HI>Delawares</HI> so cal∣led from the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> by the English, but by themselves in their own language, <HI>Lenelenoppes,</HI> or the original people, consisted of the <HI>Assunpink</HI> (Stony creek) <HI>Indians; Rankokas, (Lamikas,</HI> or <HI>Chichequaas) Mingoes, Andastakas; (Christeen</HI> creek, near <HI>Wilmington) Neshaminics,</HI> in <HI>Bucks</HI> county; <HI>Shackamaxons,</HI> about <HI>Kensington,</HI> near <HI>Philadelphia; Mantas,</HI> or <HI>Frog Indians,</HI> about <HI>Burlington,</HI> and a creek of that name, in <HI>Gloucester</HI>

county, which runs out of <HI>Jersey</HI> into the <HI>Dela∣ware,</HI> a little below <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Since the conquest and subjection of divers of the <HI>Indian</HI> nations and tribes, by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their change of residence, &amp;c.</NOTE> particularly after the <HI>Europeans</HI> became acquainted with them, (during which time they appear to have been continually decreasing in number) many of their places of residence have been changed for others, by the direction and order of their con∣querors, or superiors; especially to make room for the settlement of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> &amp;c. Hence, after the <HI>Susquahannocks</HI> were exterminated, the upper parts of the river <HI>Susquahanna</HI> were allotted to the <HI>Nanticokes,</HI> from the eastern shore of <HI>Ma∣ryland;</HI> to the <HI>Tuteloes,</HI> from <HI>Meherin</HI> river, in the south of <HI>Virginia;</HI> and to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> among which last are included the <HI>Menesinks,</HI> from above the forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the <HI>Man∣des,</HI> or <HI>Salem</HI> Indians, &amp;c. and as the country be∣comes more inhabited by <HI>Europeans</HI> and their de∣scendants, the <HI>Indians</HI> move still further back into the wilderness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the most noted nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noted na∣tions for∣merly in New Jersey and Penn∣sylvania.</NOTE> which some∣times formerly inhabited <HI>New Jersey,</HI> and the first, or most early settled parts of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> are said to have been the <HI>Narraticongs,</HI> on the north side of <HI>Rariton</HI> river, the <HI>Capitinasses,</HI> the <HI>Gacheos,</HI> the <HI>Munseys,</HI> the <HI>Pomptons,</HI> and some of the Five Nations, before the sixth was added; which was that of the <HI>Tuscororas,</HI> on account of a similarity in their language to that of the Five Nations, indicating them to have been originally of the same stock, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Ohio</HI> chiefly consist of the hun∣ters of the several nations round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nations on the Ohio, &amp;c.</NOTE> under the pro∣tection or subjection of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as, the

<P>"The extraordinary length of <HI>Indian</HI> words, and the guttural aspirations necessary in pronounc∣ing them, render the speech extremely rough and difficult. The verbs never change in their termi∣nations, as in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; but all their variations are prefixed. A strange trans∣position of syllables of different words, <HI>Euphonia gratiâ,</HI> is very common in the Indian tongue: of which I will give an instance: ōgillă, signifies <HI>fire,</HI> and căwāūnnā, <HI>great,</HI> but instead of joining the adjective and substantive, to say <HI>great fire,</HI> că∣wāūnnă ōgillă, both words would be blended into this one, cŏ-gīllă-wāūnnă.</P>
<P>"The dialect of the <HI>Oneydos</HI> is softer than that of the other nations, and the reason is, because they have more vowels, and often supply the place

They are extremely fond of method, and displeased with an irregular harrangue, because it is difficult to be remembered. When they answer, they repeat the whole, reducing it into strict order. Their speeches are short, and the sense conveyed in strong metaphors. In conversation they are sprightly, but solemn and serious in their mes∣sages relating to public affairs. Their speakers deliver themselves with surprising force, and great propriety of gesture.

in all their discourses and conversation; their lan∣guage, like theirs, being lofty and sententious: very seldom, or never,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's his∣tory of New Jersey</NOTE> more than two held a dis∣course at one and the same time, in any one com∣pany, though never so large; in which they never interrupted or contradicted each other, while speaking, but always waited in silence till he, that was speaking, had finished what he had to say, before an answer was returned, or any other speech attempted; all the rest remaining in pro∣found silence till their turn, without either mur∣mur or whisper.</P>
<P>As to their persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their per∣sons, &amp;c.</NOTE> they are generally more upright and strait, in their limbs, than <HI>Europeans</HI> are; their bodies strong, but more adapted to endure hardships than to sustain labour: they are very rarely crooked or deformed.

They are hardy, lean, and squalid, and the whole manner of their lives uniform. They sometimes paint, or streak, their faces with black, when in mourning; but with red, when their affairs go well. It is said, they have no beards, but whether it be so univer∣sally or not, among them, it is certain they have an aversion to hairs growing on their faces; for they always pull them out by the roots, when any appear, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though they are much given to mirth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their gene∣ral turn of mind and love of li∣berty, &amp;c.</NOTE> yet they are sometimes grave, even to sadness, upon com∣mon, and more so upon serious occasions.

when incensed. But liberty, in the fullest extent, is their ruling passion; to this every other consider∣ation is subservient. Their children are so trained up, as to cherish this disposition to the utmost; they are very much indulged, seldom chastised with blows, and but rarely reproved, or checked. They leave their children's faults for their own reason to correct, when they are grown up; which, they say, cannot be very great, before it arrives at some degree of maturity. They abhor what appears to have a slavish motive to action, as inconsistent with their notion of freedom and independency; even strong and importunate persuasion is industriously avoided by them, as bordering too much on depen∣dency, and a kind of violence offered to the will; they dread flavery more than death. They never liked to be asked their judgment twice upon the same thing.</P>

No ideas of state and grandeur; no homage of wealth, office, birth, or learning; no pride of house, habit, or furniture; very little emulation of any kind, to interrupt; these common causes of the violation and preventions of friendships had no place with them. They were constant and steady in their at∣tachments to each other, and, in many instances, far exceeded what might be expected. Their chief employment was hunting, fishing and fowl∣ing; making canoes, bowls, and other earthen ware; in all which they were ingenious, consider∣ing the means used. Their women's business principally consisted of planting <HI>Indian corn,</HI> parch∣ing, or roasting it, pounding it to meal, in mor∣tars, or breaking it between stones, making bread,
<PB N="305" REF="034421_0305_0FFDA0BF816986C8"/>
and dressing victuals. They also made mats, ropes, hats, and baskets (some very ingeniously) of wild hemp, and roots, or splits of trees. Besides these and their toil of hunting, they had but few exercises to fatigue them; and this they sweetened with frequently meeting in companies, to feast, dance, and make merry; in short, a life of dissi∣pation and ease, of uncertainty and want, of ap∣petite, satiety, indolence, and sleep, seemed to be the sum of their character, and the summit, to which their wishes aspired."</P>
<P>In their customs and employments, they were very loving to one another, taking great care of each other in sickness, while hopes of life remained, but afterwards sometimes remiss. If a company of them came to a <HI>Christian</HI>'s house, and the mas∣ter of it gave victuals to one of them, and none to the rest, that one divided what was given him into equal shares among his companions. If <HI>Chris∣tians</HI> visited them, they served them first, with the best of their victuals. Their times of eating were commonly the morning and evening; their seats and tables, the ground. They lived much on <HI>maize,</HI> or <HI>Indian corn,</HI> roasted in the ashes, sometimes beaten and boiled with water, called <HI>homine:</HI> they also made an agreeable cake of the ground corn, and raised beans and peas; but the woods and rivers afforded them the chief part of their provisions.</P>
<P>They were great observers of the <HI>weather,</HI> by the moon; they delighted in <HI>fine clothes;</HI> and were uneasy and impatient, in sickness, for a re∣medy: for which they commonly drank a decoc∣tion of roots, in spring water; forbearing flesh meat, excepting of the female only, when in such case they used any.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their houses, dress, &amp;c.</NOTE>Their houses, or <HI>wigwams,</HI> were sometimes many together, in towns; but mostly moveable, and occasionally fixed near springs, or other wa∣ters, for conveniency of hunting, fishing, basket-making, &amp;c. built of poles, laid on forked sticks fixed in the ground, with bark, flags, or bushes, on the top and sides; having an opening to the south, and their fire in the middle. In the night they slept on the ground, with their feet towards the fire. Their cloathing was a coarse blanket, or skin, thrown over their shoulders, which covered to the knee, and a piece of the same tied round their legs; with part of a deer skin sewed round their feet, for shoes. When a company travelled together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of travelling, &amp;c.</NOTE> they generally followed each other, in a row singly, and in silence; scarcely ever two being seen abreast, or by the side of each other: the man went before with his bow and arrow; the woman followed after, not uncommonly with a child on her back, and other burdens besides; the woman generally carrying the luggage.</P>

It was not unu∣sual, notwithstanding, to change their mates upon disagreement; the children went with the party that loved them most, the expence being of no moment to either; but in case of difference, or disagreement, on this head, the man was allowed the first choice, when the children were divided, or when there was but one; but, for the most part, agreeable to the <HI>Indian</HI> rule, in such cases, <HI>partus sequitur ventrem,</HI> the children, or young, go with the mother; which is as reasonable among them, as among cattle, since the whole burden of bringing up falls on her. They commonly washed their children in cold water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manage∣ment of their chil∣dren, &amp;c.</NOTE> as soon as born; and to make their limbs strait, they tied them to a board, and hung them on their backs, when they travelled. Their children usually walked alone at nine months old. From their infancy they were formed with care to endure hardships,

to bear derision, and even blows, patiently—at least, with a composed countenance.</P>

Their ingenuity appeared in several of their mechanic inventions and performance; as, in their manner of pointing their arrows, with a sharp, flinty stone; and in their making of their axes, of the same materials, for cutting their wood; which are often found, and dug up in the fields, with other kinds of their implements. They got fire by rubbing certain pieces of wood together of different sorts, turning the end of a hard piece upon the side of one which was soft and dry. By the means of fire and their stone axes, they felled large trees, and afterwards scooped them into bowls and other utensils. They were very studious in observing the virtues of roots and herbs, by which they usually cured themselves of diseases, both by outward and inward applications; besides which they frequently used <HI>sweating</HI> and the <HI>cold bath.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their manner of <HI>sweating</HI> the patient was, first, to inclose him in a narrow cabbin, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of which was a red hot stone; this being frequently wetted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er, made a warm vapour; with which and his own sweat, the patient being sufficiently wet, was immediately, in this condition, brought to the nearest creek, or river, and plunged into it. This was repeated as often as was thought necessary; and sometimes was said to have performed great cares; but at other times killed the pa∣tient, notwithstanding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardy natures of the <HI>Indians,</HI> especially in the <HI>small pox,</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> diseases.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their go∣vernment.</NOTE>Their government, in these parts, was monar∣chical and successive, or hereditary; but mostly on the mother's side, to prevent a spurious issue; that is, the children of him who reigns will not succeed, but his brother by the mother, or the

children of his sister; whose sons were to reign; and after them, the male children of her daugh∣ters; for no women inherited.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this mode of succession of their kings, yet, for extraordinary reasons, it was some∣times altered; of which appears an instance in <HI>S. Smith</HI>'s history of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> in the case of the old king <HI>Ockanickon,</HI> who died at <HI>Burlington,</HI> in that province, about the year 1681: before his death he altered the succession; and instead of <HI>Sheoppy</HI> and <HI>Swampis,</HI> who, in regular order, were to have succeeded him, he, for reasons in his speech there given, appointed his brother's son, <HI>Jahku<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> to succeed him, giving him some ex∣cellent advice on the occasion. This king, as there related, soon after this, made a good and pious exit; and his remains were interred in the <HI>Quakers'</HI> burying ground, at that place, being at∣tended to the grave with solemnity by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their manner, and with great respect by many of the <HI>English</HI> settlers; to whom he had been a true friend.</P>
<P>That formality, which, in the European style,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their religion, &amp;c.</NOTE> or acceptation of the term, constitutes what is commonly called religion, seems to have made but little appearance among them, though probably they had some customs no less irrational and ridi∣culous, in the eye of reason; but they were ac∣quainted with the principle of justice and truth; which, by their conduct, they demonstrated, in a high degree, so far as the most judicious among the first and early English settlers observed, and inform us. And it were to be wished that what notions they had of a Deity, and their actions relative to their duty to him, had not, in part, been misre∣presented by any; who, by attempting to give an account of what they did not, or could not, fully understand, have supplied that deficiency with
<PB N="310" REF="034421_0310_0FFDA0FE94862A68"/>
conjectures, perhaps without design of misrepre∣sentation, and thereby, in some things, disguised, or obscured, what was really known respecting some of them, in this case.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indi∣ans averse to Europe∣an customs, &amp;c.</NOTE>It is well known they were very much averse to <HI>European</HI> religion and customs, unless in such things as they could comprehend, and clearly un∣derstand were for their real benefit; yet, in this, sometimes their passions prevailed over their better understanding; instance, their drunkenness, &amp;c. But though the hoped and desired success did not so fully attend the labours bestowed on them, and the means used, both by <HI>William Penn</HI> himself, in person, and by divers others of the more pious and early settlers, whose good example was very remarkable, with the later endeavours since con∣tinued, to inform the judgment of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in these provinces, in religious affairs, to acquaint them with the principles and advantage of <HI>Chris∣tianity,</HI> to restrain them from some things, ac∣knowledged by themselves to be manifestly perni∣cious, particularly from abusing themselves with <HI>strong liquor,</HI> by law, as well as advice, &amp;c. so much as might reasonably have been wished, or expected; yet these very labours and means were far from being useless, or entirely without good effect; for the consequence declared that the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> in general, were sensible of the kind regard paid them, and of the good intended thereby; which they shewed and proved by their future conduct, and steady friendship; as appears in the preceding history, though they generally refused, in a formal manner, to embrace <HI>European manners, religion</HI> and <HI>opinions:</HI> "For, governed by their own customs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

<P><PB N="311" REF="034421_0311_0FFDA0991F126C08"/>They are thought (says <HI>William Penn</HI>) to have believed in a God and immortality;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Willi∣am Penn's account of the Indians.</NOTE> and seemed to aim at a public worship: in performing this, they sometimes sat in several circles, one within ano∣ther; the action consisted of singing, jumping, shouting, and dancing; which they are said to have used, mostly as a tradition from their ances∣tors, rather than from any knowledge, or enquiry of their own into the serious parts of its origin.</P>
<P>They said the great King, who made them, dwelt in a glorious country to the southward; and that the spirits of the best should go thither, and live again. Their most solemn worship was a sacrifice of the <HI>first fruits;</HI> in which they burned the first and fattest buck, and feasted together upon what else they had collected. In this sacri∣fice they broke no bones of any creature, which they ate; but after they had done, they gathered upon together, and burned them very carefully. They distinguished between a <HI>good and evil Manetta,</HI> or <HI>Spirit;</HI> worshipping the former for the good, they hoped; and, it is said, some of them, the latter, that they might not be afflicted with the <HI>evil,</HI> which they feared; so slavishly dark are some of them represented to have been in their understandings! But whether this last be true, in a general sense, or peculiar only to some parts, it was certainly not the case at all among the <HI>Indians</HI> within the limits of these provinces, or, at least, very much concealed from the first and early settlers of them.</P>
<P>But in late years it is less to be admired that the <HI>Indians,</HI> in these provinces, and their vicinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for the Indians' aversion to Christia∣nity, &amp;c.</NOTE> have shewn so little regard to the <HI>Christian</HI> religion but rather treated it, as well as its professors, with contempt and abhorrence, when it is duly con∣sidered what kind of <HI>Christians</HI> those generally are, with whom they mostly deal and converse;

as, the <HI>Indian</HI> traders, and most of the inhabitants of the back counties of this and the neighbouring provinces, who have chiefly represented the pro∣fessors of <HI>Christianity</HI> among them, for many years!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The trade between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> in later years especi∣ally, has been mostly carried on by the vilest, and most abandoned part of the community: the <HI>Indians</HI> have long had but very little opportunity to converse with any other kind of <HI>Christians,</HI> besides these, who go most among them: from the lives and conduct of these they judge of <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI> and <HI>European</HI> manners, &amp;c. This is mentioned in a treatise, printed in <HI>London,</HI> in 1759, as one cause, among others, of the first war, that commenced with them in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> about the year 1754; wherein is likewise expressed; "It would be too shocking to describe the conduct and behaviour of the traders, when among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and endless to enumerate the abuses, the <HI>Indians</HI> had received and borne from them, for a series of years. Suffice it to say, that several of the tribes were, at last, weary of bearing.

of this kind they rely more on experience, than theory; and they mostly formed their judgment of the <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Europeans,</HI> and of their <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>customs,</HI> not from the words, but from the actions and <HI>manners</HI> of those, with whom they most conversed and transacted business.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following has been printed in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as a genuine speech of an <HI>Indian chief</HI> in that province; but whether it be really so, or not, it certainly contains arguments, which have been used by some of these people, and, in this place, may serve, in part, to give some <HI>idea</HI> of their sentiments on the subject: it is thus first introduced, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>"In, or about the year of our Lord, 1710, a <HI>Swedish Missionary</HI> preached a sermon, at an <HI>Indian</HI> treaty, held at <HI>Conestogoe</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> in which sermon he set forth <HI>original sin,</HI> the necessity of a <HI>Mediator;</HI> and endeavoured, by certain arguments, to induce the <HI>Indians</HI> to embrace the <HI>Christian religion.</HI> After he had ended his discourse, one of the <HI>Indi∣an</HI> chiefs made a <HI>speech</HI> in reply to the sermon; and the discourses, on both sides, were made known by interpreters. The <HI>Missionary,</HI> upon his return to <HI>Sweden,</HI> published his sermon, and the <HI>Indian</HI>'s answer, Having wrote them in <HI>Latin,</HI> he dedicated them to the university of <HI>Ups<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> and requested them to furnish him with arguments, to confute such strong reasoning of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Indian speech,</HI> translated from the Latin, is as follows," <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"A <HI>speech</HI> delivered by an <HI>Indian chief,</HI> in reply to a sermon, preached by a <HI>Swedish Missionary,</HI> in order to convert the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Christian religion.</HI></P>
<P>"Since the subject of his (the Missionary's) errand is to persuade us to embrace a new doctrine, perhaps it may not be amiss, before we offer him the reasons, why we cannot comply with his request, to acquaint him with the grounds and principles of that religion, which he would have us abandon.</P>
<P>"Our forefathers were under a strong persuasion, as we are, that those, who act well, in this life, shall be rewarded in the next, according to the degree of their virtue: and on the other hand, that those, who behave wickedly here, will undergo such punishments hereafter, as are proportionate to the crimes they were guilty of This hath been con∣stantly and invariably received and acknowledged for a truth, through every successive generation of our ancestors. It could not have taken its rise from fable; for human fiction, however artfully and plausibly contrived, can never gain credit long, among any people, where free enquiry is allowed; which was never denied by our ancestors; who, on the contrary, thought it the sacred, inviolable, natural right of every man, to examine and judge for himself. Therefore we think it evident that our notion, concerning future rewards and punishments, was either revealed immediately from heaven, to some of our forefathers, and from them descended to us, or, that it was implanted in each of us, at our creation, by the Creator of all things. Whatever the methods might have been, whereby God hath been pleased to make known to us his will, and give us a knowledge of our duty, it is still, in our sense, a <HI>divine revelation.</HI></P>
<P>"Now we desire to propose to him some few questions. Does he be∣lieve that our forefathers, men, eminent for their piety, constant and warm in the pursuit of virtue, hoping thereby to merit everlasting hap∣piness, were all <HI>damned?</HI> Does he think that we, who are their zealous imitators, in good works, and influenced by the same motives as they were, earnestly endeavouring, with the greatest circumspection, to tread the paths of integrity, are in a state of <HI>damnation?</HI> If these be his senti∣ments, they are surely as impious as they are bold and daring.</P>
<P>"In the next place, we beg that he would explain himself more par∣ticularly concerning the <HI>revelation</HI> he talks of. If he admits no other, than what is contained in his <HI>written book,</HI> the contrary is evident, from what has been shewn before: but, if he says, God has revealed himself to us, but not sufficient for our salvation; then, we ask, to what purpose should he have revealed himself to us in any wise? It is clear, that a <HI>revelation,</HI> insufficient to save, cannot put us in a better condition, than we should be in, without any revelation at all. We cannot conceive that God should point out to us the end, we ought to aim at, without opening to us the way to arrive at that end. But, supposing our under∣standings to be so far illuminated, as to know it to be our duty to please God, who yet hath left us under an incapacity of doing it, will this <HI>Missionary,</HI> therefore, conclude that we shall be <HI>eternally damned?</HI> Will he take upon him to pronounce damnation against us, for not doing those things, which he himself acknowledges were impossible by us to be done? It is our opinion that every man is possessed of sufficient knowledge for his salvation. The <HI>Almighty,</HI> for any thing we know, may have com∣municated the knowledge of himself to a different race of people, in a different manner.</P>
<P>"Some say, they have the will of God in <HI>writing:</HI> be it so; their <HI>revelation</HI> has no advantage above ours; since both must be equally suffi∣cient to save; otherwise the end of the revelation would be frustrated. Besides, if they be both true, they must be the same in substance; and the difference can only lie in the mode of communication He tells us there are many precepts in his <HI>written revelation,</HI> which we are entirely ignorant of But these <HI>written commands</HI> can only be designed for those, who have the <HI>writings;</HI> they cannot possibly regard us. Had the <HI>Al∣mighty</HI> thought so much knowledge necessary to our salvation, his good∣ness would not long have deferred the communication of it to us; and to say, that, in a matter so necessary, he could not, at one and the same time, equally reveal himself to all mankind, is nothing less than an abso∣lute denial of his omnipotence. Without doubt he can make his will manifest, without the help of any <HI>book,</HI> or the assistance of any <HI>bookish man</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>"We shall, in the next place, consider the arguments, which arise from a consideration of <HI>Providence.</HI> If we are the work of God, (which I presume will not be denied) it follows from thence, that we are under the care and protection of God: for, it cannot be supposed that the <HI>Deity</HI> should abandon his own creatures, and be utterly regardless of their welfare. Then, to say, that the <HI>Almighty</HI> hath permitted us to remain in a fatal error, through so many ages, is to represent him as a tyrant: how is it consistent with his justice, to force life upon a race of mortals, without their consent, and then <HI>damn them eternally,</HI> without ever opening to them a door of salvation? Our conceptions of the <HI>gra∣cious God</HI> are more noble; and we think that those, who teach otherwise, do little less than <HI>blaspheme.</HI> Again, it is through the care and goodness of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> that from the beginning of time, through many gene∣rations, to this day, our name has been preserved, unblotted out by ene∣mies, unreduced to nothing. By the same care we now enjoy our lives; are furnished with the necessary means of preserving those lives. But all these things are trifling, compared with our salvation.</P>
<P>"Therefore, since God hath been so careful of us, in matters of little consequence, it would be absurd to affirm, that he has neglected us, in cases of the greatest importance. Admit, that he hath forsaken us, yet it could not have been without a just cause. Let us suppose, that an <HI>heinous crime</HI> was committed by one of our ancestors, like to that, which we are told, happened among another race of people; in such case, God would certainly punish the <HI>criminal,</HI> but would never involve us, who are innocent, in his guilt. Those who think otherwise must make the <HI>Almighty</HI> a very <HI>whimsical, ill-natured being.</HI> Once more, are the <HI>Christians</HI> more virtuous? or, rather, are they not more vicious, than we are? If so, how came it to pass, that they are the objects of God's beneficence, while we are neglected? Does the Deity confer his favours without rea∣son, and with so much partiality? in a word, we find the <HI>Christians</HI> much more depraved, in their morals, than ourselves; and we judge of their doctrine by the <HI>badness of their lives."</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conrad Weiser's letter re∣specting it.</NOTE>I write this, in compliance with thy request, to give thee an account of what I have observed among the <HI>Indians,</HI> in relation to their belief and confidence in a <HI>Divine Being,</HI> according to the observations I have made, from 1714, in the time of my youth, to this day, (about the year 1746).</P>
<P>If, by the word <HI>religion,</HI> people mean an as∣sent to certain creeds, or the observance of a set of <HI>religious</HI> duties; as, appointed prayers, singings, preaching, baptism, &amp;c. or, even, <HI>Heathenish worship,</HI> then it may be said, the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and their neighbours, have no <HI>religion.</HI> But, if, by <HI>religion,</HI> we mean an <HI>attraction</HI> of the soul to God, whence proceeds a confidence in, and hunger af∣ter, the knowledge of him, then this people must be allowed to have some <HI>religion</HI> among them, not∣withstanding their sometimes savage deportment. For we find among them some tracts of a confi∣dence in God alone; and, even, sometimes, though but seldom, a vocal calling upon him: I shall give one or two instances of this, that fell under my own observation.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="034421_0317_0FFDA10106BABB88"/>In the year 1737, I was sent, the first time, to <HI>Onondago,</HI> at the desire of the Governor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> I departed in the latter end of February, very unexpectedly, for a journey of five hundred <HI>English</HI> miles, through a wilderness, where there was neither road nor path, and at such a time of the year, when creatures (animals) could not be met with, for food. There were with me a <HI>Dutch∣man</HI> and three <HI>Indians.</HI> After we had gone one hundred and fifty miles on our journey, we came to a narrow valley, about half a mile broad, and thirty long; both sides of which were encompas∣sed with high mountains; on which the snow laid about three feet deep: in it ran a stream of water, also about three feet deep; which was so crooked, that it kept a continued winding course from one side of the valley to the other. In order to avoid wading so often through the water, we endea∣voured to pass along on the slope of the moun∣tain; the snow being three feet deep, and so hard frozen, on the top, that we could walk upon it: but we were obliged to make holes in the snow with our hatchets, that our feet might not slip down the mountain; and thus we crept on. It happened that the <HI>old Indian</HI>'s foot slipt; and the root of a tree, by which he held, breaking, he slid down the mountain, as from the roof of a house; but happily he was stopped in his fall, by the string, which fastened his pack, hitching on the stump of a small tree. The other two <HI>Indians</HI> could not go to his aid, but our <HI>Dutch</HI> fellow-tra∣veller did; yet not without visible danger of his own life. I also could not put a foot forward, till I was helped; after this we took the first oppor∣tunity to descend into the valley; which was not till after we had laboured hard for half an hour with hands and feet. Having observed a tree ly∣ing directly off, from where the <HI>Indian</HI> fell, when we were got into the valley again, we went back
<PB N="318" REF="034421_0318_0FFDA0F1E91E5E00"/>
about one hundred paces, where we saw, that if the <HI>Indian</HI> had slipt four or five paces further, he would have fallen over a rock, one hundred feet perpendicular, upon craggy pieces of rocks below. The <HI>Indian</HI> was astonished, and turned quite pale; then with out-stretched arms, and great earnest∣ness he spoke these words: <HI>"I thank the great Lord and Governor of this world, in that he has had mercy upon me, and has been willing that I should live longer."</HI> Which words I, at that time, put down in my journal: this happened on the 25th of March, 1737.</P>
<P>In the 9th of April following, while we were yet on our journey, I found myself extremely weak, through the fatigue of so long a journey, with the cold and hunger, which I had suffered; there having fallen a fresh snow about twenty inches deep, and we being yet three days journey from <HI>Onondago,</HI> in a frightful wilderness; my spirit failed, my bo∣dy trembled and shook; I thought I should fall down and die; I stept aside, and sat down under a tree, expecting there to die. My companions soon missed me; the <HI>Indians</HI> came back, and found me sitting there. They remained awhile silent; at last, the old <HI>Indian</HI> said, "My dear companion, thou hast hitherto encouraged us, wilt thou now quite give up? remember that evil days are better than good days: for when we suffer much, we do not sin; sin will be driven out of us by suffering: but good days cause men to sin; and God cannot extend his mercy to them; but contrarywise, when it goeth evil with us, God hath compassion upon us." These words made me ashamed; I rose up, and travelled as well as I could.</P>
<P>The next year I went another journey to <HI>Onondago,</HI> in company with <HI>Joseph Spanhenberg</HI> and two others. It happened that an <HI>Indian</HI> came to us in the evening, who had neither shoes, stock∣ings,
<PB N="319" REF="034421_0319_0FFDA102898A4E78"/>
shirt, gun, knife, nor hatchet; in a word, he had nothing but an old torn blanket, and some rags. Upon enquiring whither he was going, he answered to <HI>Onondago.</HI> I knew him, and asked him how he could undertake a journey of three hundred miles so naked and unprovided, having no provisions, nor any arms, to kill creatures, for his sustenance? He answered, he had been among enemies, and had been obliged to save himself by flight; and so had lost all. This was true, in part; for he had disposed of some of his things among the <HI>Irish,</HI> for strong liquors. Upon fur∣ther talk, he told me very chearfully; "That <HI>God</HI> fed every thing, which had life, even, the rattle snake itself, though it was a bad creature; and that <HI>God</HI> would also provide, in such a man∣ner, that he should get alive to <HI>Onondago;</HI> he knew for certain that he should go thither; that it was visible <HI>God</HI> was with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the wilderness; because they always cast their care upon him; but that, contrary to this, the Euro∣peans always carried bread with them." He was an <HI>Onondago Indian;</HI> his name was <HI>Onontagketa;</HI> the next day we travelled in company; and the day following I provided him with a knife, hatchet, flint, and tinder, also shoes and stockings, and sent him before me, to give notice to the council, at <HI>Onondago,</HI> that I was coming; which he truly performed, being got thither three days before us.</P>
<P>Two years ago I was sent by the Governor to <HI>Shamokin,</HI> on account of the unhappy death of <HI>John Armstrong,</HI> the <HI>Indian trader,</HI> (about 1744). After I had performed my errand, there was a feast pre∣pared; to which the Governor's messengers were invited: there were about one hundred persons pre∣sent, to whom, after we had, in great silence, devour∣ed a fat bear, the eldest of the chiefs made a speech, in which he said, "That, by a great misfortune, three of their brethren, the <HI>white men,</HI> had been
<PB N="320" REF="034421_0320_0FFDA0A215FAFBD0"/>
killed by an <HI>Indian;</HI> that nevertheless the sun was not set, (meaning there was no war); it had only been somewhat darkened by a small cloud, which was now done away; he that had done evil was like to be punished, and the land to remain in peace: therefore he exhorted his people to <HI>thank∣fulness to God;</HI> and thereupon he began to sing with an awful solemnity, but without expressing any words; the others accompanied him with their voices: after they had done, the same <HI>Indian,</HI> with great earnestness, or fervour, spoke these words; <HI>"Thanks, thanks, be to thee, thou great Lord of the world, in that thou hast again caused the sun to shine, and hast dispersed the dark cloud; —the Indians are thine.</HI></P>

They were mostly of the <HI>Minusing</HI> tribe, and came from a town called <HI>Mahackloosing,</HI> or <HI>Wyalusing,</HI> on, or near the east branch of <HI>Sus∣quahanna</HI> river, in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> about two hun∣dred miles north westward from the city. Their chief man, whom the rest of the company styled their minister, was named <HI>Papunehung,</HI> or <HI>Papou∣nan;</HI> and their interpreter, <HI>Job Chillaway,</HI> an <HI>In∣dian.</HI></P>
<P>On their arrival, they waited on Governor <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> to pay him their respects, and to deliver three prisoners, whom they had redeemed; hav∣ing themselves absolutely refused to join with the other <HI>Indians,</HI> in the savage war, which raged about that time; though their visit was principally on a different account.</P>
<P>They had a public conference with the Govern∣or, in the state-house, on the occasion, in the
<PB N="321" REF="034421_0321_0FFDA0C96BA6D1E8"/>
presence of many citizens; wherein <HI>Papounan</HI> ex∣pressed the design of their visit was principally to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> on a religious account; that they desired to do justice, to love God, and to live in peace; requesting, at the same time, that none of his company should be permitted to have any spirituous liquors, &amp;c. He refused the presents, offer∣ed by the Governor, and gave him the reasons; further saying: "I think on God, who made us; I want to be instructed in his worship and service; I am a great lover of peace, and have never been concerned in war affairs; I have a sincere remem∣brance of the <HI>old friendship</HI> between the <HI>Indians</HI> and your <HI>forefathers,</HI> and shall ever observe it." After mentioning some other things, and expressing himself further on the view, or design, of their vi∣sit, on a religious account, he said, "Though what he had mentioned respecting religious affairs might appear trivial to some, who thought differ∣ent from him, yet he was fixed in his mind re∣specting them; that their young men agreed with him, and wanted to love God, and to desist from their former bad course of life;" further declaring, "I am glad I have an opportunity of mentioning these several affairs in the presence of such a large auditory of young and old people; the great God observes all that passes in our hearts, and hears all that we say one to another," &amp;c. The notes, &amp;c. on the occasion, were taken from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter∣preter by Secretary <HI>Peters.</HI></P>
<P>He then finished with a solemn act of public thanksgiving and prayer to God, with great devo∣tion and energy, in the <HI>Indian language</HI> (not being able to speak nor understand <HI>English</HI>). The un∣usualness, force and sound of the <HI>Indian language,</HI> on such an occasion, with the manifest great sin∣cerity, fervour and concern of the speaker, seemed to strike the whole auditory in an uncommon manner, as well as the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves; who,
<PB N="322" REF="034421_0322_0FFDA12685B49240"/>
all the while, behaved with a gravity and deport∣ment becoming the occasion, and appeared to unite heartily with him, in his devotion.</P>
<P>They were kindly treated by the Governor, and remained in town afterwards several days, visiting and conferring with divers of the <HI>Friends,</HI> or <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> and attending their religious meetings, while they staid; who behaved towards them in a kind, hospitable and friendly manner. They repeatedly expressed their great dislike and abhorrence of war, as arising from a bad spirit, admiring that the <HI>Christians</HI> were such great warriors, rather than lovers and cultivators of peace, &amp;c. They kept themselves entirely from strong liquor, and uniformly observed a sober, orderly and commend∣able behaviour, often expressing their satisfaction with what they heard from the Friends.</P>
<P>From the account, they gave of themselves, they had been of this mind for several years be∣fore this time; and, as far as appeared, and was understood by those they visited, principally from an immediate sense of divine goodness, manifested in their minds, without any instrumental means, preaching, or information from other persons; yet, it was but lately, that in a more especial manner they had been thus disposed, and that <HI>Pa∣pounan</HI> had been induced to preach among them; in which service he was afterwards joined by two or three other Indians. They appeared very earnest and sincere in promoting true piety; which they re∣presented, according to their apprehension of it, to be the effect of an internal operation of the di∣vine influence on the mind; whereby it became changed from a bad to a good state: this they em∣phatically expressed by <HI>the heart becoming soft, and filled with good,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The interpreter gave the following a count of <HI>Papunehung</HI>'s change, or conversion, <HI>viz.</HI> "He
<PB N="323" REF="034421_0323_0FFDA0C2D5E8D360"/>
was formerly a drunken man; but the death of his father bringing sorrow over his mind, he fell into a thoughtful, melancholic state; in which his eyes were turned to behold the earth, and consider the things which are thereon; from seeing the folly and wickedness, which prevailed, his sorrow increased; and it was given him to believe, there was a great power, which had created all these things. Upon which his mind was turned from beholding this lower world, to look towards him, who had created it; and strong desires were raised in his heart after the further knowledge of his <HI>Creator:</HI> nevertheless the <HI>Almighty</HI> was not yet pleased to be found, or known, by him. But his desires increasing, he forsook the town, and went into the woods, in great bitterness of spirit. He was missed by the other <HI>Indians,</HI> who feared some casualty might have happened to him, but after searching for him, he was not found. At the end of five days it pleased God to appear to him, to his comfort; and to give him a sight not only of his own inward state, but also an acquaint∣ance, or knowledge, into the works of nature: so that he apprehended a sense was given him of the virtues and natures of several herbs, roots, plants, trees, with the different relation they had one to another; and he was made sensible that man stood in the nearest relation to God, of any part of the creation. It was at this time that he was more particularly made sensible of his duty to God. He came home rejoicing, and endeavoured to put in practice what he apprehended was required of him," &amp;c.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> made a second visit to the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> in the next following summer, on the same account, and behaved in the same regular and be∣coming manner as before. They maintained an orderly public worship, in their way, at stated times: at some of which they were visited by several
<PB N="324" REF="034421_0324_0FFDA0C7ABF422E0"/>
of the Friends. <HI>Papunehung,</HI> their chief preacher, in his discourses, at such times, principally ad∣vised and exhorted them to circumspection, and brotherly love, in their conduct; that it might be manifest they retained a true sense of their Crea∣tor's goodness and favour continued to them; and in his public prayers and addresses to his Maker, he acknowledged, and returned thanks for, his mercy, in still affording them a sense of his com∣passion and loving kindness, requesting a continu∣ance and increase thereof; that they might jointly know, in the end, a place of rest, where love would prevail and have the dominion. When they were not dispersed, as in their hunting season, it appeared, they constantly met in this manner, in the morning, before sun-rise, and in the even∣ing, after sun-set.</P>
<P>The purport of more of Papunehung's expres∣sions was, "That it was an affair of much sor∣row to him, that men should make so bad use of the breath of life, which God had breathed into them; and which ought continually to be im∣proved to his honour, and the mutual benefit of mankind; that it was not well to speak of things, which related to the <HI>Almighty,</HI> only from the root of the tongue; (meaning, in a superfi∣cial, or insensible, manner) but, in order that such words should be good, they must proceed from the good principle in the heart; that he had, for many years, felt the good spirit in his heart; but, wanting to try and prove it, in order to come to some certainty, he remained in an unsettled state, till about four years ago, when he received an assurance, that this love was good, and that he needed no further enquiry about it; and being past all doubt, that this was the right way, he had endeavoured to walk steadily therein since that time; this spirit was a spirit of love; and that it was his daily prayer, that it might continu∣ally
<PB N="325" REF="034421_0325_0FFD7A152CA84428"/>
abide with him. That when he felt it preva∣lent in his heart, he was so directed, as to speak what was right, and prevented from saying any wrong thing; that by reason of men not keeping to this love, which their Maker hath given them, in their hearts, the evil spirit gets possession there, and destroys all that is good in them; and this is the cause why men dislike one another, grow an∣gry with, and endeavour to kill, one another; but when we follow the leadings of the good spi∣rit, it causes our hearts to be tender, to love one another, to look upon all mankind as one, and so to become as one family," &amp;c.</P>
<P>That strict amity between the <HI>Indians</HI> and the first and early <HI>English</HI> settlers of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI> and their successors, for above seventy years, with the means of fixing and preserving that friend∣ship, have already been occasionally mentioned in the course of the preceding history. It was about the year 1754, when a very different conduct be∣gan to exhibit itself, in some of the <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣mencement of the In∣dian war in 1754, &amp;c.</NOTE> situ∣ated north westward of the settled parts of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> very contrary to what before had been the uniform practice of that people, in this pro∣vince.</P>
<P>Hostilities commenced; and many of the fron∣tier inhabitants suffered, in consequence of a sa∣vage war. The affair was considered as very ex∣traordinary, and caused much speculation in such persons, as were but little acquainted with the na∣ture and management of <HI>Indian</HI> affairs, about that time, in the province; that these people, who had ever shewed themselves kind and steady friends<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Note.</HI> Besides <HI>Papunehung</HI> and his company, there were some other sober, religiously disposed <HI>Indians,</HI> who came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> about this time, from a place about fifty miles above <HI>Wyalusing;</HI> of these <HI>Samuel Curtis,</HI> of the <HI>Nan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ke</HI> tribe, was one. He had formerly been addicted to strong liquor, but was now reformed by means of <HI>Papunehung</HI>'s mi∣nistry, become a sober man, and after some time, a preacher among his people.</NOTE>

to the <HI>English,</HI> for such a long series of years, as ever since their first arrival in the country, should now become their enemies, and join with the <HI>French</HI> against them: and many, who had been continually flocking into the province, in later years, having from their inexperience and igno∣rance, too despicable an opinion of that people, and treating them accordingly, were by this con∣duct foolishly enraged against the whole species indiscriminately; insomuch that, in the latter part of the year 1763, calling to their aid the madness of the wildest enthusiasm, with which, under pretence of religion, certain most furious zealots, among the preachers of a numerous sect, in the province, could inspire their hearers, to cover their barbarity, a number of, not improperly nam∣ed, <HI>armed demi-savages,</HI> inhabitants of Lancaster county, principally from the townships of <HI>Pax∣tang</HI> and <HI>Donnegal,</HI> and their neighbourhood, committed the most horrible <HI>massacre,</HI> that ever was heard of in this, or perhaps, any other pro∣vince, with impunity!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract is taken from an authentic publication, printed at that time in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> entitled, <HI>"A narrative of the late massacrees, in Lancaster county, of a number of Indians, friends of this pro∣vince,"</HI> &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>"These <HI>Indians</HI> were the remains of a tribe of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> set∣tled at <HI>Conestogoe,</HI> and thence called <HI>Conestogoe Indians.</HI> On the first arri∣val of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> messengers from this tribe came to welcome them, with presents of <HI>venison, corn</HI> and <HI>skins;</HI> and the whole tribe entered into a treaty of friendship with the first Proprietary <HI>William Penn; which was to last as long as the sun should shine, or the waters run into the rivers.</HI></P><P>"This treaty has been since frequently renewed, and the <HI>chain bright∣ened,</HI> as they express it, from time to time. It has never been violated, on their part, or ours, till now. As their lands, by degrees, were mostly purchased, and the settlement of the <HI>white people</HI> began to surround them, the Proprietor assigned them lands on the <HI>manor</HI> of <HI>Conestogoe,</HI> which they might not part with; there they have lived many years, in <HI>friendship</HI> with their <HI>white neighbours,</HI> who loved them for their peaceable, inoffen∣sive behaviour.</P><P>"It has always been observed, that <HI>Indians,</HI> settled in the neighbour∣hood of <HI>white people,</HI> do not increase, but diminish continually. This tribe accordingly went on diminishing, till there remained in their town, on the <HI>manor,</HI> but twenty persons, <HI>viz.</HI> seven men, five women and eight children, boys and girls.</P><P>"Of these <HI>Shehaes</HI> was a very old man, having assisted at the second treaty, held with them by <HI>Mr. Penn,</HI> in 1701; and ever since continued a faithful friend to the <HI>English;</HI> he is said to have been an exceeding good man, considering his education, being naturally of a most kind, bene∣volent temper.</P><P>—"This little society continued the custom they had begun, when more numerous, of addressing every new <HI>Governor,</HI> and every <HI>descendant</HI> of the first <HI>Proprietary,</HI> welcoming him to the province, assuring him of their fidelity, and praying a continuance of that favour and protection, which they had hitherto experienced. They had accordingly sent up an address of this kind to our present Governor (<HI>John Penn,</HI> Esquire) on his arrival; but the same was scarce delivered when the unfortunate ca∣tastrophe happened, which we are about to relate.</P><P>"On Wednesday, the 14th of December, 1763, fifty-seven men, from some of our frontier townships, who had projected the destruction of this little commonwealth, came all well mounted, and armed with fire-locks, hangers and hatchets, having travelled through the country in the night to <HI>Conestogoe manor.</HI> There they surrounded the small vil∣lage of <HI>Indian</HI> huts, and just at break of day, broke in upon them all at once. Only three men, two women, and a young boy were found at home; the rest being out among the neighbouring <HI>white people;</HI> some to sell their baskets, brooms and bowls, they manufactured, and others on other occasions. These poor defenceless creatures were immediately fired upon, stabbed and hatcheted to death! The good <HI>Shehaes,</HI> among the rest, cut to pieces in his bed! All of them were <HI>scalped,</HI> and other∣wise <HI>horribly mangled.</HI> Then their huts were set on fire, and most of them burnt down.</P><P>"The Magistrates of <HI>Lancaster</HI> sent out to collect the remaining <HI>In∣dians,</HI> brought them into the town, for their better security against any further attempt; and, it is said, condoled with them, on the misfortune, that had happened, took them by the hand, and <HI>promised them protection.</HI></P><P>"They were put into the work-house, a strong building, as the place of greatest safety.</P><P>"These cruel men again assembled themselves; and hearing that the remaining fourteen <HI>Indians</HI> were in the work-house at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> they suddenly appeared before that town on the twenty-seventh of December. Fifty of them armed as before, dismounting, went directly to the work-house, and by violence broke open the door, and entered with the utmost fury in their countenances. When the poor wretches saw they had <HI>no protection</HI> nigh, nor could possibly escape, and being without the least weapon of defence, they divided their little families, the children cling∣ing to their parents; they fell on their faces, protested their innocence, declared their love to the <HI>English,</HI> and that, in their whole lives, they had never done them injury; and in this posture, they all received the hatchet! Men, women and children, were every one inhumanly mur∣dered in cold blood!</P><P>"The barbarous men, who committed the atrocious fact, in defiance of government, of all laws human and divine, and, to the eternal dis∣grace of their country and colour, then mounted their horses, huzzaed in triumph, as if they had gained a victory, and rode off unmolested!</P><P>"The bodies of the murdered were then brought out, and exposed in the street, till a hole could be made in the earth, to receive and cover them. But the wickedness cannot be covered, and the guilt will lie on the whole land, till justice is done on the <HI>murderers. The blood of the innocent will cry to heaven for vengeance.</HI></P><P>"Notwithstanding the proclamations and endeavours of the Governor, on the occasion, &amp;c.

in the same county; where they had been placed by the government, in former time; and had ever since continued in strict and inviolable friend∣ship with the <HI>English;</HI> being then far within the set∣tled parts of the province, and entirely innocent, as to the war: of whom mention has already been made, in the preceding history, respecting their

last compact with <HI>William Penn,</HI> in the year 1701; and in the treaties held with them since by Go∣vernor <HI>Keith,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>"The bloody scene was compleated in the town of <HI>Lancaster</HI> itself; where the remainder of the tribe, which had escaped the first slaughter, taking refuge, declaring their innocence, and cry∣ing for mercy and protection, were through the connivance, if not the encouragement, of the <HI>Christian-professing</HI> Magistrates, and other princi∣pal persons of that town, all inhumanly butchered, in cold blood, even infants at the breast, by the same party of armed <HI>ruffians,</HI> at mid-day, without opposition, or the least molestation!—to the last∣ing infamy of the inhabitants of that place, who had power sufficient to prevent it!"</P>
<P>With hands imbrued in innocent blood, and taking courage from their unopposed success and cruelty, the insurgents now greatly increased in number, and proceeded towards <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with avowed intention to cut off a party of inno∣cent and friendly <HI>Indians</HI> there; consisting of those of <HI>Wyalusing,</HI> before mentioned, and some others; who had thrown themselves under the protection of the government, to the number of about one hundred and forty. By their conduct, they ap∣peared to depend on the secret assistance of a num∣ber of their brethren, the same kind of saints, in that city; who, afterwards, by many of them advocating their cause and proceedings, with other strong symptoms, appeared to have been, either, in some manner, privately connected with them, or concerted and directed the whole tragical and bloody insurrection.</P>
<P>This lawless <HI>banditti</HI> advanced, in many hun∣dreds, armed, as far as <HI>Germantown,</HI> within about six miles of the city, threatening death and slaugh∣ter to all, who should dare to oppose them; and,
<PB N="330" REF="034421_0330_0FFDA0D563910E88"/>
in all probability, they would have effected their bloody purpose, had they not met with such a pro∣per and vigorous opposition from the government, and the inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as they seem∣ed not to expect; which put a stop to their career. But so far was the contagion spread, and so deeply had the spirit of faction infected the minds of ma∣ny, that the weakness of the government was not able to punish these <HI>murderers,</HI> nor to chastise the insurgents! a sorrowful presage of an approaching change in that happy constitution, which had so long afforded a peaceable asylum to the unjustly oppressed and distressed, by means of the great influx and increase of such kind of people into it, of later years, as experience has abundantly demonstrated a rod of iron is more proper to rule, than such a mild establishment, as is better adapted to promote the prosperity of the virtuous and good, than properly to chastise the most pro∣fligate of mankind; more calculated to make men happy, than to punish the wicked and ungoverna∣ble, according to their demerits.</P>
<P>But there were many in the province, who very well knew the cause of this revolt of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and of the sorrowful consequences of it; which, it was not in their power, at that time, to prevent. The management of <HI>Indian</HI> affairs was put into new hands; and after the death of <HI>James Logan,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>James Logan,</HI> who died in 1751, was the Proprietary's Secretary, and principal Agent, or commissioner, for land affairs, for near forty years.</NOTE> if not some time before, a very different conduct was too much practised towards that people, from that which formerly had never failed to gain and preserve their friendship and alliance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> whom the <HI>Indians</HI> regarded from the beginning, above any other people in the pro∣vince, were excluded from the Proprietary agency, to which the management of their affairs was
<PB N="331" REF="034421_0331_0FFDA0CEB92F9278"/>
chiefly committed; though they were, for the above reason, of all persons the most proper to be concerned, or to act, in it.</P>
<P>But there were several causes, which admini∣stered to the unhappy rupture, which may be seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the Indian war, &amp;c. in 1754, &amp;c.</NOTE> as mentioned in a treatise, published in <HI>London,</HI> in 1759, written in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> entitled, <HI>"An en∣quiry into the causes of the alienation of the Delaware and Shawanese Indians, from the British interest,"</HI> &amp;c. And, in the whole, it is certain they had been too much neglected; of which the <HI>French,</HI> then at war with the <HI>English,</HI> made their advantage.</P>
<P>The principal causes of the quarrel and aliena∣tion of these <HI>Indians</HI> were asserted to be,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The abuses committed in the <HI>Indian trade;</HI> which had been, more or less, of long continuance, and very difficult to be properly regu∣lated, or redressed; though doubtless a great part of them might have been better guarded against, and prevented, than they really were.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Governor <HI>Thomas,</HI> in a message to the Assembly of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in 1744, says, "I cannot but be apprehensive that the <HI>Indian</HI> trade, as it is now carried on, will involve us in some fatal quarrel with the <HI>Indians.</HI> Our traders, in defiance of the laws, carry spirituous liquors among them, and take the advantage of their inordinate appetite for it, to cheat them of their <HI>skins,</HI> and their <HI>wampum,</HI> which is their money, and often debauch their wives into the bargain. Is it to be wondered at, then, if, when they recover from their drunken fit, they should take some severe revenges? If I am rightly informed, the like abuses of the traders in <HI>New England,</HI> were the principal causes of the <HI>Indian</HI> wars there; and at length obliged the government to take the trade into their own hands. This is a matter, that well deserves your attention, and perhaps, will soon require your imitation."</P><P>The author of <HI>the enquiry</HI> into the cause of the alienation of the <HI>Indians,</HI> &amp;c. above mentioned, further observes on this part, "It would be too shocking to describe the conduct, and behaviour of the traders, when among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and endless to enumerate the abuses, the <HI>Indians</HI> had received and borne from them, for a series of years, suffice it to say that several of the tribes were, at last, weary of bearing," &amp;c.</P><P>At a treaty, held with the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> by Commissioners, appointed by Governor <HI>Hamilton,</HI> in the year 1753, the former say,</P><P>"Brother Onas (which means <HI>Pen,</HI> the name given by them to the Governors of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>) your traders now bring scarce any thing but <HI>rum</HI> and <HI>flour;</HI> they bring but little powder and lead, and other valuable goods. The rum ruins us. We beg you would prevent its coming in such quantities, by regulating the traders. We never understood the trade was to be for <HI>whisky</HI> and <HI>flour.</HI> We desire it may be forbidden, and none sold in the <HI>Indian</HI> country; but that, if the <HI>Indians</HI> will have any, they may go among the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When these <HI>whisky traders</HI> come, they bring thirty or forty cags, and put them down before us, and make us drink; and get all the skins, that should go to pay the debts, we have contracted for goods, bought of the fair trader; and by these means we not only ruin ourselves, but them too. These wicked <HI>whisky sellers,</HI> when they have once got the <HI>Indians</HI> in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued we must be inevitably ruined; we most earn∣estly, therefore, beseech you to remedy it."</P><P>In the report of these Commissioners to the Governor, on their return from the treaty, they conclude as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<P>Thus, may it please the Governor, we have given a full and just ac∣count of our proceedings, and we hope our conduct will meet with his approbation. But, in justice to these <HI>Indians,</HI> and the promises we made them, we cannot close our report without taking notice, that the quan∣tities of strong liquors, sold to these <HI>Indians,</HI> in the places of their resi∣dence, and during their hunting season, from all parts of the counties, over <HI>Susquahanna,</HI> have increased, of late, to an inconceivable degree, so as to keep those poor <HI>Indians</HI> continually under the force of liquors, that they are thereby become dissolute, enfeebled and indolent, when sober, and untractable and mischievous in their liquor, always quarrelling, and often murdering one another: that the traders are under no bonds, nor give any security for their observance of the laws, and their good be∣haviour; and by their own intemperance, unfair dealing and irregula∣rities, will, it is to be feared, entirely estrange the affections of the <HI>In∣dians</HI> from the <HI>English,</HI> deprive them of their natural strength and acti∣vity, and oblige them either to abandon their country or submit to any terms, be they ever so unreasonable, from the <HI>French, These truths,</HI> may it please the Governor, are of so interesting a nature, that we shall stand excused in recommending, in the most earnest manner, <HI>the deplorable state of these Indians,</HI> and the heavy discouragements, under which our com∣merce with them, at present, labours, to the Governor's most serious consideration, that some good and speedy remedies may be provided, be∣fore it be too late.</P>

The Governor asked him, what he meant by <HI>fraud? Teedyuscung</HI> an∣swered, "When one man had formerly liberty to purchase lands, and he took the deed from the <HI>Indians</HI> for it, and then dies; after his death his children forge a deed like the true one, with the same <HI>Indian</HI> names to it; and thereby take lands from the <HI>Indians</HI> which they never sold; this is <HI>fraud:</HI> also, when one king has land beyond the river, and another king has land on this side, both bounded by rivers, mountains and springs, which cannot be moved; and the <HI>Proprietaries,</HI> greedy to purchase lands, buy of one king what belongs to another; this likewise is <HI>fraud."</HI></P><P>Then the Governor asked <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> whether he had been served so? He answered, <HI>"Yes;</HI> I have been served so in this province; all the land extending from <HI>Tohiccon,</HI> over the great mountain, to <HI>Wioming,</HI> has been taken from me by <HI>fraud;</HI> for when I had agreed to sell land to the <HI>old Proprietary,</HI> by the course of the river, the <HI>young Proprietaries</HI> came, and got it run by a <HI>strait course,</HI> by the compass, and by that means, took in double the quantity, intended to be sold," &amp;c.</P></NOTE></P>

Smith,</HI> in his history of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> gives the following very different account of this affair, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>"The fact was, this <HI>Weekquehela</HI> was an <HI>Indian</HI> of great note and ac∣count, both among the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> of the tribe that resided about <HI>South River,</HI> (near <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> in <HI>East Jersey</HI>), where he lived with a taste much above the common rank of <HI>Indians,</HI> having an exten∣sive farm, cattle, horses, negroes, and raised large crops of wheat; and was so far <HI>English,</HI> in his furniture, as to have a house well provided with feather beds, calico curtains, &amp;c. He frequently dined with governors, and great men, and behaved well, &amp;c but his neighbour, captain <HI>John Leonard,</HI> having purchased a cedar swamp of other <HI>Indians,</HI> to which he laid claim, and Leonard refusing to take it on his right, he resented it highly, and threatened that he would shoot him; which he accordingly took an opportunity of doing, in the spring, 1728, while <HI>Leonard</HI> was, in the day time, walking in his garden, or near his own house, at South River aforesaid; for which he had a legal trial, and was executed for actu∣al murder."</P><P>But the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at a meeting in <HI>Lancaster,</HI> with Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> &amp;c. May 29th, 1757, say thus,</P><P>"Brothers, some years ago, in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> one of the head men of the <HI>Delawares</HI> had been out a hunting. On his return, he called to see a gentleman, a great friend of his, one of your people; whom he found in the field; when the gentleman saw him, he came to meet him. It was rainy weather, and the <HI>Delaware</HI> chief had his gun under his arm; they met at a fence, and as they reached out their hands to each other, the <HI>Dela∣ware</HI>'s gun went off, by accident, and shot him dead. He was very much grieved, went to the house, and told the gentleman's wife what had happened; and said, he was willing to die, and did not chuse to live after his friend. She immediately sent for a number of the inhabitants: when they were gathered, some said, it was an accident, and could not be helped; but the greatest number were for hanging him; and he was taken by the Sheriff, and carried to <HI>Amboy,</HI> where he was tried and hanged.</P><P>"There was another misfortune that happened: A party of <HI>Shawa∣nese,</HI> who were going to war against their enemies, in their way through <HI>Carolina,</HI> called at a house, not suspecting any harm, as they were among their friends: a number of the inhabitants rose, and took them prisoners, on account of some mischief which was done there about that time; sus∣pecting them to be the people who had done the mischief; and carried them to <HI>Charlestown,</HI> and put them in prison, where the chief man, called <HI>The Pride,</HI> died. The relations of these people were much exas∣perated against you, our brothers, the <HI>English,</HI> on account of the ill treat∣ment you gave their friends; and have been continually spiriting up their nations to take revenge.</P><P>"Brothers, you desired us to open our hearts, and inform you of every thing we know, that might give rise to the quarrel between you and our nephews and brothers:—That, in former times, our forefathers conquered the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and put petticoats on them; a long time after that, they lived among you, our brothers; but, upon some difference between you and them, we thought proper to remove them, giving them lands to plant and hunt on, at <HI>Wioming</HI> and <HI>Juniata,</HI> on <HI>Susquahanna;</HI> but you, covetous of land, made plantations there, and spoiled their hunting grounds; they then complained to us, and we looked over those lands, and found their complaints to be true.</P><P>"At this time they carried on a correspondence with the <HI>French;</HI> by which means the <HI>French</HI> became acquainted with all the causes of com∣plaint they had against you; and as your people were daily increasing their settlements, by these means you drove them back into the arms of the <HI>French;</HI> and they took the advantage of spiriting them up against you, by telling them, <HI>"Children,</HI> you see, and we have often told you, how the <HI>English,</HI> your brothers, would serve you; they plant all the country, and drive you back; so that, in a little time, you will have no land: it is not so with us; though we build trading houses on your land, we do not plant it; we have our provisions from over the great water."</P><P>"We have opened our hearts, and told you what complaints we have heard, that they had against you; and our advice to you is, that you send for the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>them;</HI> treat them kindly, and rather give them some part of their fields back again, than differ with them.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Religious state Pennsylvania.—Variety and har∣mony of the religious sects in the province.—Their proportion in Philadelphia.—Mennonists,—Dunk∣ards,—Swenckfelders,—Moravians.—Conclusion. —Thomas Makin's account of Pennsylvania, in a Latin Poem, in <HI>1729,</HI> addressed to J. Logan.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has already been observed that the civil con∣stitution of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> was originally founded on such a generous plan of liberty, that the freedom allowed by it, of <HI>thinking on religious subjects,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious liberty one cause of Pennsylva∣nia's im∣provement, &amp;c.</NOTE> and of <HI>worshipping the Almighty,</HI> according to the best of men's understandings, without being deprived either of their natural rights, as men, or of their civil liberties, as subjects of government, on that account, has not a little contributed to the great and rapid increase and prosperity of the province, above any other of the <HI>British</HI> colonies in <HI>Ameri∣ca;</HI> and, in proportion to its age, and other cir∣cumstances, rendered it far superior, in real worth and importance; so, in giving an account of its general state, after the conclusion of the war, in 1761, some representation, at least, of the various religious societies, or sects, of which its inhabitants mostly consist, becomes proper and necessary.</P>
<P>There is a greater number of different religious societies in this province, than, perhaps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numerous sects in Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE> in any other, throughout the <HI>British</HI> dominions besides; and in regard to disputes, on religious subjects, and the consequences of an universal toleration of all the varieties of opinion, in religion, though so widely different, and so contrary and opposite to
<PB N="338" REF="034421_0338_0FFDA0E2F1D0F5D0"/>
one another, elsewhere much dreaded, it is appre∣hended there is not more real harmony any where known, in this respect, even, under the most des∣potic <HI>hierarchies,</HI> than in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> Here are the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of divers of them.</NOTE> who were principally the first settlers, and, in effect, the makers of the province; and who, in general, are already described, in the <HI>Introduction:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number of religious visits from the preachers of this society, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and other places in <HI>Europe,</HI> but chiefly from <HI>England,</HI> in the service of the gospel, to this country, and their society in <HI>America,</HI> between the years 1661, and 1771, as appears by their own records, was about 132; exclusive of those, who, from <HI>Europe</HI> had settled in <HI>America,</HI> and travelled in that service; who were many, &amp;c.</NOTE> The <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> according to the manner of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> and <HI>Swedish Lutherans:</HI> The <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>Independants,</HI> of various kinds, or sects; and the <HI>German Calvinists:</HI> The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> and the <HI>Jews:</HI> The <HI>Baptists</HI> of different kinds; with those among the <HI>Germans,</HI> called <HI>Mennonists,</HI> and <HI>Dunk∣ards,</HI> or <HI>Dumplers;</HI> the <HI>Moravians</HI> and <HI>Swencksel∣ders;</HI> besides the <HI>Aborigines of America,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their har∣mony and concord one with ano∣ther.</NOTE>All these, for a considerable series of years, have, in general, from the example of the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> who were providentially the cause of that liberty, which they all there enjoy, and who ap∣pear never to have persecuted any other people, for religion, maintained such harmony and con∣cord among themselves, as approaches nearer to that <HI>universal love</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> which <HI>Christianity</HI> teaches, and which its votaries, in general, profess, at least, in theory, than has ever been known to arise from any contrary conduct, or intolerant au∣thority, so predominant in many other countries.</P>
<P>For, notwithstanding their seeming so extremely to differ one from another, in religious sentiments and customs; and that some of their opinions and practices doubtless are very absurd, and probably more or less so under every profession, or form;
<PB N="339" REF="034421_0339_0FFDA0EA6CD441E0"/>
in which an absolute uniformity is not to be ex∣pected, in the human race;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uniformity of mind, like that of the body, not to be expected, &amp;c.</NOTE> neither is it more rea∣sonable to be so, than that men should all be of one and the same size, age, understanding and ca∣pacity; yet by the constitution of the civil govern∣ment, as they are not here permitted to oppress one another, on that account, so, in general, among the more thinking and intelligent, in every sect, or society, a firm persuasion seems to prevail, that they all have one and the same thing, <HI>happiness,</HI> in view; and that their difference arises from opinion and custom only, respecting the mode of obtaining it; which notion has such a tendency to moderate and temper their way of thinking on religious matters, as, in great measure to occasion that <HI>for∣bearance</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> which appears in their con∣duct to each other; a surer characteristic of true <HI>Christianity,</HI> and <HI>best Philosophy,</HI> than the practice of many, who make great profession of superior attainments of science and knowledge, and who shew much greater zeal for what they esteem to be truth, and place more stress on opinion, creeds, or beliefs, than in practice and charity, than is to be found in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Quakers, &amp;c.</NOTE> com∣pose, probably, about one seventh part of its inha∣bitants. The rest of that society at present have their residence principally in the first, or older counties of <HI>Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, New∣castle,</HI> &amp;c. and in the year 1770, they had between sixty and seventy meeting houses, for divine wor∣ship, in the province, and lower counties on <HI>Dela∣ware.</HI> But of late they have been much exceeded in number by other societies, complexly taken, though they generally are esteemed among the wealthiest, and most substantial of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of England</HI> has several places of worship in the city, as before mentioned, in the
<PB N="340" REF="034421_0340_0FFDA0E7F8A4C738"/>
description of it and its public edifices;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the dif∣ferent reli∣gious socie∣ties, &amp;c.</NOTE> (page 279) and also in divers other parts of the province; and the <HI>German Lutherans</HI> have large congregati∣ons in <HI>Philadelphia, Lancaster,</HI> &amp;c. but the Pres∣byterians and Independants are supposed, by far, to be more numerous than any other particular religious society, taking in the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or German Calvinists; several of the back counties being principally peopled by them; they have flowed in, of late years, from the north of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in very large numbers, besides their great internal increase and still greater industry, than that of many others, to make proselytes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The proportion, which the number of each religious society, in Philadelphia, bears to each other, may, in some manner, appear from the number of burials, in each of them annually, taken from the printed bills of mortality, for the following ten years successively, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P><TABLE>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In their claim to an∣tiquity, they have suffer∣ed much persecution, &amp;c.</NOTE>They say their church has always from the be∣ginning (though under almost continual oppression and persecution) insisted on the above confession, with many other articles, even, from the time of the Apostles; from which the violence of persecu∣tion and death, which at different times they en∣dured, never could compel them to depart; in∣stancing the ten persecutions, till 310 years after <HI>Christ;</HI> and afterwards till the year 1210, &amp;c. when great numbers of them suffered death, chiefly in <HI>Europe,</HI> for not admitting <HI>infant baptism▪</HI> but only a <HI>baptism</HI> into their faith, in their own mode, and likewise for refusing to take an <HI>oath</HI> and <HI>bear arms;</HI> and for adhering to other articles of

their faith; for which they suffered such heavy persecutions, that they were reduced to a small number, till the time of the <HI>reformation,</HI> when, from the year 1520 to 1530, they began to flou∣rish again, to the no small mortification of the <HI>Romish clergy;</HI> who gave them the name of <HI>Ana∣baptists;</HI> and used their endeavours, first, by per∣suasion, to draw them over, and then by a terri∣ble persecution, throughout all the emperor's do∣minions, by banishments, prisons, torture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are persecuted in Germany</NOTE> and death, in various modes; all which they encoun∣tered, and suffered with inflexible fortitude, ra∣ther than depart from their tenets.

<P>Though these <HI>Mennonists</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> appear to be a species or sect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They dis∣claim the conduct at Munster, &amp;c.</NOTE> of those who went under the general name of <HI>Baptists,</HI> or <HI>Anabaptists</HI> for∣merly in <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> yet, in both their writings and practice, they seem highly to disapprove or reprobate and condemn, the wild actions and extravagances, done at <HI>Munster,</HI> &amp;c. by these people in 1533, in opposition to the ma∣gistracy and government; in consequence of which many thousands of persons lost their lives, in dif∣ferent parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>

<P>Many of these people, who were dispersed in divers parts of the <HI>German</HI> provinces, especially in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and places adjacent, having met together, entered into conditions, and, by paying a great tribute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They ob∣tain a tem∣porary re∣lief, &amp;c.</NOTE> they obtained an exemption from <HI>taking oaths,</HI> from <HI>bearing arms,</HI> and from having their <HI>children baptised;</HI> and gained the liberty of upholding <HI>public worship,</HI> in their own way: but notwithstanding this, they were grossly imposed upon and abused, for the exercise of their consci∣ences; being, in time of war, obliged to have their houses filled with wicked crews of soldiers, and to endure many other grievances and distresses.

<P>They have, from time to time, received suc∣cours from <HI>Europe,</HI> and are now increased to a considerable number.

<P>But their method of educating their children and youth, to answer the end designed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Education of their youth.</NOTE> has been more so; and perhaps, exceeded by no other peo∣ple in the province: an affair of very great im∣portance, in whatever view we take it: the low∣est, or most ignorant and uninformed part of the rational creation, perhaps, doth not excel the most knowing and sagacious of the brutal kind, so much as one part of the human species exceeds the other, in superior knowledge, wisdom and fe∣licity, by means of an early and good education, a wise and virtuous institution of youth, in its most extensive acceptation? For, though God has given talents to men, yet it is in their power to improve or debase them, and to apply them to proper or improper objects, by the means which God has given; and how much this depends on education, information and early habit, is suffici∣ently manifest to such as are enough acquainted with the subject, and with mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusion respecting variety of religious opinions, &amp;c.</NOTE>AS it is not my intention to say any thing fur∣ther, respecting the more generally well known forms of the other religious societies, in the pro∣vince, which, at different times, have resulted from a variety of opinion, on the subject of reli∣gion, I shall, therefore, only observe, that, so long as different degrees of light and knowledge are communicated to men, while custom and edu∣cation vary among them, and while the capacity and opportunity to receive instruction are unequal and various in individuals, according to their dif∣ferent abilities and situations in the world, so long it cannot reasonably be expected that all people should see or think exactly alike, or possess an uni∣formity of understanding, in objects merely intel∣lectual, more especially such as are only known to exist in opinion, or belief: for as our bodies dif∣fer in shape, size and capacity, and vary in their properties and qualities, so is it in respect to the minds of men▪ which are as various as the flowers of the field; and, when duly considered, have no less real beauty, in their variety: it is as un∣reasonable to expect, or attempt, an absolute uni∣formity of the one as of the other; and compul∣sion, in such case, would be no less tyrannical and absurd, than the use of <HI>Procrustes</HI>'s bed; for the nature of all sects, in religion, is to keep up the difference.</P>
<P>But, as wisdom is better than strength, and the cause above the effect, so the power of reason and persuasion alone, on the intelligent and rational mind, is the most adequate and proper to rectify the erroneous, or less informed understanding, in objects entirely of a mental or intellectual na∣ture; in which a difference of thinking may not be inconsistent with reason and truth; for perhaps,
<PB N="357" REF="034421_0357_0FFDA0E6488A5338"/>
as light and knowledge increase and advance among mankind, the greater will be the variety of sentiment? Which, so long as it is free, may have the more effectual tendency to discuss and discriminate truth from error, and that not incom∣patible with an unity of principle, even, in reli∣gious subjects; provided that men, instead of wickedly making religion an engine of power, for one part of the community to oppress the other, would keep within the bounds of mental pursuits only, in their pretensions to things of this kind, and clear of all selfish and ambitious news, artifice, and party-design; this has ever been instanced in the wisest and most civilized na∣tions, and in the progress of arts and sciences. For, though the first principles of things are but few, and these all ultimately terminate in unity, yet like the rays of light, from the solar luminary, which reflect an infinite variety of appearances, and so much the more, the less they are obscured and ob∣structed, so the greater the diversity of effect from these principles, the more is the eternal wisdom displayed, in any one part of the creation.</P>
<P>In regard to the final issue of the various opini∣ons of a religious nature, among mankind, with their Creator, and of the many different customs arising from them, (than the lowest and most absurd of which, as well as the most rational and sublime, perhaps, nothing shews more the weakness of the human race, and its absolute dependance on a <HI>Superior Being</HI>) why may we not conclude, that, as a person of superior wisdom and sagacity, or of better information than others, sometimes observes and considers the disagreements and dis∣putes, between persons of different judgment, or education, and inferior knowledge, but of sin∣cere mind and intention, whether in the low and common affairs of life, or on things of a superior
<PB N="358" REF="034421_0358_0FFEA8513B627BF0"/>
and mental nature, on which they seem so widely to differ in opinion, that, by their manner of ma∣naging their arguments, or disputes, they would probably never agree; nay, instead of uniting▪ sometimes their opposition of sentiment may render them so much the more positive and tenacious of their different opinions, as to become highly in∣censed against each other (which is often the case with the more ignorant) because they do not un∣derstand the subjects of dispute all alike; yet, by his greater penetration and understanding of the affair in dispute, he plainly perceives they all mean, or in∣tend, the same thing, in the main; and their views all center to one point, or what appears to them right, (though if left to themselves they would probably never agree) that they all are proportionably right; and, when properly understood, differ only either in circumstantials, or on account of their various degrees of understanding and conception, or ac∣cording to such information as each is possessed of, or by reason of the different mediums of edu∣cation and custom, through which they see; whence he may pity their ignorance, and perhaps blame their animosity, which arises from it; but cannot justly censure them for any thing, that is providenti∣ally out of their power: so, who will deny that the great <HI>Creator</HI> of mankind, who sees and knows all things, looks down upon his creatures, whom he has proportionably endowed with <HI>reason,</HI> and the proper <HI>means</HI> of answering the end of their existence, and, in his great <HI>wisdom,</HI> beholds how zealous they are to please him, and obtain felicity; which they all aim at, according to the different degrees of knowledge, capacity and ability afford∣ed them? I say, who will venture to deny, not∣withstanding their great disparity, disagreement, seeming inconsistency and the many contrary cus∣toms, used by men, for that purpose (divers of which to one another, and not without reason,
<PB N="359" REF="034421_0359_0FFDA0B830A13800"/>
may appear very absurd and improper for the end designed thereby); that in his <HI>wisdom and mercy,</HI> which are over all his works, he commiserates all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most wise, affectionate and true <HI>parent of his offspring?</HI> For, according to the divine model above, it is in degree here below; as wisdom (which is the real <HI>sent</HI> of the Almighty) prevails, <HI>ignorance</HI> vanishes; and as that superior happiness, and true Christian charity, which are the conse∣quences of the former, gain ground, among men, in the same proportion must mankind necessarily approach to, or partake of, the supreme love and perfection; which ever take place of all vio∣lence, cruelty and wrath, the infernal dregs, and genuine offspring of the latter; whose habitation is only in the regions of darkness and sorrow, the reward of false conception and error; which ne∣ver can be the situation of the perfectly happy, the end of all true religion.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>Note, <HI>Thomas Makin</HI> appears to have been one of the most early settlers in the province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> from —for, in the year 1689, he was second master (<HI>George Keith</HI> being the first) of the Friends' public grammar school, in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> which was the first of the kind in the province, and instituted about that time. He was some∣times clerk of the Provincial Assembly; which, in early time, was long held in the Friends' meeting house. The <HI>English</HI> version is made by the transcriber, R. P.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF PENNSYLVANIA, ANNO 1729.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>First, <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>'s memorable name,</L>
<L>From <HI>Penn,</HI> the Founder of the country, came;</L>
<L>Sprung from a worthy and illustrious race,</L>
<L>But more en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bled by his virtuous ways.</L>
<L>High in esteem among the great he stood;</L>
<L>His wisdom made him lovely, great and good.</L>
<L>Tho' he be said to die, he will survive;</L>
<L>Thro' future time his memory shall live:</L>
<L>This wise <HI>Proprietor,</HI> in love and praise,</L>
<L>Shall grow and flourish to the end of days.</L>
<L>With just <HI>propriety,</HI> to future fame,</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> shall record his name.</L>
<L>This, <HI>Charles the Second</HI> did, at first command,</L>
<L>And for his father's merits gave the land:</L>
<L>But his high virtue did its value raise</L>
<L>To future glory, and to lasting praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath the temp'rate zone the country lies,</L>
<L>And heat and cold with grateful change supplies.</L>
<L>To fifteen hours extends the longest day,</L>
<L>When sol in cancer points his fervid ray:</L>
<L>Yet here the winter season is severe;</L>
<L>And summer's heat is difficult to bear.</L>
<L>But western winds oft cool the scorching ray,</L>
<L>And southern breezes warm the winter's day.</L>
<L>Yet oft, tho' warm and fair the day begun,</L>
<L>Cold storms arise before the setting sun:</L>
<L>Nay, oft so quick the change, so great its pow'r,</L>
<L>As summer's heat, and winter, in an hour!</L>
<L>So violent the wind, that oft the ground</L>
<L>With rooted trees is cover'd wide and round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="363" REF="034421_0363_0FFDA10FAA54A798"/>
<L>A savage <HI>Indian</HI> race here first was known;</L>
<L>But milder now, in life and manners, grown.</L>
<L>To friendship's laws they faithfully adhere;</L>
<L>And love the <HI>English</HI> with a mind sincere.</L>
<L>Of jars and baneful strife they shun the cause;</L>
<L>And practise justice uncompell'd by laws.</L>
<L>A life of ease, and void of care, they chuse;</L>
<L>But labour, and the toilsome arts, refuse.</L>
<L>Thro' woods and forests wide, they hunting stray,</L>
<L>In search of beasts, their much beloved prey.</L>
<L>Their skins, for cloaths, their flesh, for food is sought;</L>
<L>Warm raiment, and delicious food, unbought.</L>
<L>Thro' devious wilds, and woody deserts, they</L>
<L>Oft wander far, but never lose their way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But more laborious in domestic care,</L>
<L>The female sex their corn and bread prepare;</L>
<L>Long journeys these, in patience, persevere;</L>
<L>And heavy loads upon their bodies bear.</L>
<L>With unremitted labor, too, the same</L>
<L>Their wooden vessels make, and baskets frame.</L>
<L>Wild fruits and strawberries by them are sought;</L>
<L>And fish and fowl by various methods caught,</L>
<L>All stronger drink than water from the lake,</L>
<L>The Indian youth forbidden are to take.</L>
<L>No feather bed, nor easy couch they keep;</L>
<L>Upon the ground, or shaggy skin they sleep.</L>
<L>For cloathing, first warm skins they did possess;</L>
<L>But now coarse linen hides their nakedness.</L>
<L>Where'er they go their heads are always bare;</L>
<L>But skins upon their feet and legs they wear.</L>
<L>Tho' brown, or copper colour, marks them all,</L>
<L>Yet are their bodies proper, strait and tall.</L>
<L>Chaste in their lives, unlawful lusts they fly;</L>
<L>Scarce ever known to break the marriage tie.</L>
<L>With native eloquence their speech abounds,</L>
<L>Untaught, with figures grand, and lofty sounds.</L>
<L>O happy <HI>Indians!</HI> bless'd with joy and peace;</L>
<L>No future cares of life disturb your ease!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On just and equal terms the land was gain'd,</L>
<L>No force of arms has any right obtain'd:</L>
<L>'Tis here without the use of arms, alone,</L>
<L>The bless'd inhabitant enjoys his own;</L>
<L>Here many, to their wish, in peace enjoy</L>
<L>Their happy lots, and nothing doth annoy.</L>
<L><PB N="365" REF="034421_0365_0FFDA0D804ADA1C0"/>But sad <HI>New England</HI>'s diff'rent conduct show'd</L>
<L>What dire effects from injur'd <HI>Indians</HI> flow'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet once to <HI>arms false rumor</HI> called here;</L>
<L>To which the vulgar most inclined were.</L>
<L>'Twas on a certain day the plot began;</L>
<L>Deluded crowds together madly ran:</L>
<L>By artful means the stratagem was laid,</L>
<L>And great commotion thro' the city made;</L>
<L>So wild the tumult and so great the fear,</L>
<L>No law nor order was observed there:</L>
<L>While from th' approaching foe to haste away,</L>
<L>One urg'd, another orders gave, to stay.</L>
<L>This strange affair, whatever was design'd,</L>
<L>For loss to many, will be kept in mind.</L>
<L>The ev'ning did the plot's design betray;</L>
<L>The farce was ended with the closing day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This fruitful land all plenty doth produce;</L>
<L>And never fails to answer human use.</L>
<L>Here yellow Ceres loads the joyful fields;</L>
<L>And golden crops the happy harvest yields.</L>
<L>With beasts the woods, with fish the streams abound;</L>
<L>The bending trees with plenteous fruits are crown'd.</L>
<L>Here flocks and herds in flow'ry pastures stray;</L>
<L>Their num'rous young around them feed and play.</L>
<L>The squirrels, rabbits, and the timid deer</L>
<L>To beasts of prey are yet exposed here:</L>
<L>The bear, the panther, and the wolf devour</L>
<L>Th' innocuous flocks, which seldom are secure.</L>
<L>Here dwells the crafty fox, which, night and day,</L>
<L>Invents his wiles, to catch th' unwary prey.</L>
<L>But now these noxious beasts, which much annoy</L>
<L>The growing grain, and tender flocks destroy,</L>
<L>Are by a law diminish'd, with their breed,</L>
<L>And in the woods more safe the cattle feed.</L>
<L>Amphibious animals here too are found;</L>
<L>Which both in water live, and on the ground;</L>
<L>These for their skins alone are ever priz'd,</L>
<L>And lose their lives; their carcase is despis'd.</L>
<L>'Tis here the <HI>mocking bird</HI> extends his throat,</L>
<L>And imitates the birds of ev'ry note;</L>
<L>'Tis here the smallest of the feather'd train,</L>
<L>The <HI>humming bird,</HI> frequents the flow'ry plain.</L>
<L>Its motion quick seems to elude the eye;</L>
<L>It now a bird appears, and now a fly.</L>
<L><PB N="367" REF="034421_0367_0FFDA0E081044100"/>The various <HI>woodpeckers</HI> here charm the sight;</L>
<L>Of mingled red, of beauteous black and white.</L>
<L>Here's <HI>whip-per-will;</HI> a bird, whose fanci'd name</L>
<L>From its nocturnal note imagin'd, came.</L>
<L>Here, in the fall, large flocks of pigeons fly,</L>
<L>So num'rous, that they darken all the sky.</L>
<L>Here other birds of ev'ry kind appear,</L>
<L>Whose names would be too long to mention here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Large sturgeons num'rous crowd the Delaware;</L>
<L>Which, in warm weather, leap into the air;</L>
<L>So high, that (strange to tell!) they often fly</L>
<L>Into the boats, which on the river ply!</L>
<L>That royal fish is little valu'd here;</L>
<L>But where more scarce, 'tis more esteem'd and dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here num'rous mines of many kinds are found,</L>
<L>And precious metals, treasured in the ground.</L>
<L>The verdant woods, roots, herbs, and flow'rs produce,</L>
<L>For many virtues fam'd for human use.</L>
<L>Here insects are, which many much admire,</L>
<L>Whose plumes in summer ev'nings shine like fire.</L>
<L>Here too the <HI>magnet</HI>'s found, whose wond'rous pow'r</L>
<L>Directs the seamen to each distant shore.</L>
<L>Here is the stone-like flax<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Asbestus.</NOTE> of wond'rous fame,</L>
<L>For not consuming in the burning flame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the chief produce of this happy land</L>
<L>Is always good, and ever in demand:</L>
<L>And bounteous Ceres' rich redundant stores</L>
<L>Are shipp'd abroad to many distant shores.</L>
<L>Its fame to distant regions far has spread,</L>
<L>And some for peace, and some for profit, led;</L>
<L>Born in remotest climes, to settle here,</L>
<L>They leave their native soil, and all that's dear;</L>
<L>And still will flock from far, here to be free;</L>
<L>Such pow'rful charms has lovely liberty!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here high unequal taxes have no place;</L>
<L>A just proportion ev'ry person pays.</L>
<L>Th' extensive woods abound with various game,</L>
<L>Where all may freely take, and use the same.</L>
<L>In ev'ry flowing stream, all persons may</L>
<L>Take plenteous fish, and freely use the prey.</L>
<L>Such privilege in Europe is unknown;</L>
<L>Where ev'ry man is bounded with his own.</L>
<L><PB N="369" REF="034421_0369_0FFDA0A3E1D04FA0"/>'Twas hither first the <HI>British</HI> cross'd the main;</L>
<L>Thence many others left their native plain:</L>
<L><HI>Hibernia</HI>'s sons forsake their native home;</L>
<L>And from <HI>Germania</HI> crowded vessels come.</L>
<L>Not for themselves alone the <HI>British</HI> care;</L>
<L>Since ev'ry stranger may partake a share.</L>
<L>Hence still more culture shall the soil receive;</L>
<L>And ev'ry year increasing plenty give.</L>
<L>Clear'd from the woods, more fruitful lands they gain;</L>
<L>And yellow <HI>Ceres</HI> loads the extended plain.</L>
<L>Here bubbling fountains flow thro' ev'ry mead;</L>
<L>Where flocks and herds delight to drink and feed.</L>
<L>The marshy grounds improv'd rich meadows yield;</L>
<L>The wilderness is made a fruitful field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Legislators, chosen ev'ry year,</L>
<L>Proceed to act, as shall to them appear.</L>
<L>Here just administration of the laws</L>
<L>Make public good, and private right one cause.</L>
<L>All crimes are punish'd, as their natures are;</L>
<L>The laws unwrested no offenders spare.</L>
<L>All civil magistrates have pow'r and trust,</L>
<L>To act, in office, what is right and just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' first it was th' intention of the laws</L>
<L>To punish vice, and favour virtue's cause;</L>
<L>Yet, by the pow'r of gold how oft is lost</L>
<L>The poor man's cause, and sacred justice crost!</L>
<L>Nay, may it not be said, for cursed gold,</L>
<L>Both law and justice oft are to be sold!</L>
<L>If with the rich, to law a poor man go,</L>
<L>Believe me, he shall have an overthrow!</L>
<L>For <HI>Danae</HI> fair had still remain'd a maid,</L>
<L>And in the brazen tow'r securely staid,</L>
<L>Had not the pow'r of gold unbarr'd the chain;</L>
<L>What cannot gold and pow'rful love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>or</HI> Jove.</NOTE> obtain!</L>
<L>What wonder then, if love of gold compel</L>
<L>The minds of men the right of law to sell?</L>

<L>When stormy winter whitens all below,</L>
<L>When woods and plains are clad in ice and snow,</L>
<L>The ships with <HI>icy chains</HI> are anchor'd fast,</L>
<L>Till the dissolving spring return at last;</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>boreas</HI> rage, and stormy tempests blow,</L>
<L>The streams are silent, and not seen to flow;</L>
<L>The fish then near the surface cease to play,</L>
<L>And to the bottom safely make their way.</L>
<L><PB N="371" REF="034421_0371_0FFDA11158ADFE40"/>But yet thro' holes, which in the ice are made,</L>
<L>With hook and line goes on the fisher's trade.</L>
<L>Sometimes the ice so strong and firm we know,</L>
<L>That loaded waggons on the rivers go!</L>
<L>But yet so temp'rate are some winters here,</L>
<L>That in the streams no bars of ice appear;</L>
<L>And all the season boats and shipping may,</L>
<L>With oar and sail divide the liquid way;</L>
<L>So various and uncertain is the clime,</L>
<L>For heat and cold extreme, in little time!</L>

<L>Between two rivers plac'd, two miles between;</L>
<L>The <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Sculkil,</HI> new to fame,</L>
<L>Both ancient streams, yet of a modern name.</L>
<L>The city, form'd upon a beauteous plan,</L>
<L>Has many houses built, tho' late began;</L>
<L>Rectangular the streets, direct and fair;</L>
<L>And rectilinear all the ranges are.</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Certain <HI>conditions,</HI> or <HI>concessions,</HI> agreed upon by <HI>William Penn,</HI> Proprietary and Governor of the province of Pennsylvania, and those who are the adventurers and purchasers in the same province, the eleventh of July, one thousand six hundred and eighty-one.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THAT so soon as it pleaseth God that the abovesaid persons arrive there, a certain quantity of land, or ground plat, shall be laid out, for a large town or city, in the most convenient place, upon the river, for health and navigation; and every purchaser and adventurer shall, by lot, have so much land therein as will answer to the proportion, which he hath bought, or taken up,
<PB N="2" REF="034421_0375_0FFEA8A2081A7680"/>
upon rent: but it is to be noted, that the surveyors shall consider what roads or high-ways will be necessary to the cities, towns, or through the lands. Great roads from city to city not to contain less than <HI>forty</HI> feet, in breadth, shall be first laid out and declared to be for high-ways, before the dividend of acres be laid out for the purchaser, and the like observation to be had for the streets in the towns and cities, that there may be convenient roads and streets preserved, not to be encroached upon by any planter or builder, that none may build irregularly to the damage of another. <HI>In this, custom governs.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That the land in the town be laid out together after the pro∣portion of <HI>ten thousand</HI> acres of the whole country, that is, <HI>two hundred</HI> acres, if the place will bear it: however, that the pro∣portion be by lot, and entire, so as those that desire to be toge∣ther, especially those that are, by the catalogue, laid together, may be so laid together both in the town and country.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, when the country lots are laid out, every purchaser, from <HI>one thousand,</HI> to <HI>ten thousand</HI> acres, or more, not to have above <HI>one thousand</HI> acres together, unless in <HI>three</HI> years they plant a family upon every <HI>thousand</HI> acres; but that all such as purchase together, lie together; and, if as many as comply with this con∣dition, that the whole be laid out together.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That, where any number of purchasers, more or less, whose number of acres amounts to <HI>five</HI> or <HI>ten thousand</HI> acres, de∣sire to sit together in a lot, or township, they shall have their lot, or township, cast together, in such places as have convenient har∣bours, or navigable rivers attending it, if such can be found; and in case any one or more purchasers plant not according to agreement, in this concession, to the prejudice of others of the same township, upon complaint thereof made to the Governor, or his Deputy, with assistance, they may award (if they see cause) that the complaining purchaser may, paying the survey money, and purchase money, and interest thereof, be entitled, enrolled and lawfully invested, in the lands so not seated.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the proportion of lands, that shall be laid out in the first great town, or city, for every purchaser, shall be after the proportion of <HI>ten</HI> acres for every <HI>five hundred</HI> acres purchased, if the place will allow it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That notwithstanding there be no mention made, in the se∣veral deeds made to the purchasers; yet the said <HI>William Penn</HI> does accord and declare, that all rivers, rivulets, woods, and un∣derwoods, waters, watercourses, quarries, mines, and minerals,
<PB N="3" REF="034421_0376_0FFDA0B4293C0F90"/>
(except mines royal) shall be freely and fully enjoyed, and wholly by the purchasers, into whose lot they fall.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That, for every <HI>fifty</HI> acres, that shall be allotted to a ser∣vant, at the end of his service, his quit-rent shall be <HI>two shillings</HI> per annum, and the master, or owner of the servant, when he shall take up the other <HI>fifty acres,</HI> his quit-rent, shall be <HI>four shil∣lings</HI> by the year, or, if the master of the servant (by reason in the indentures he is so obliged to do) allot out to the servant <HI>fifty</HI> acres in his own division, the said master shall have, on demand, allotted him, from the Governor, the <HI>one hundred</HI> acres, at the chief rent of six shillings per annum.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. And, for the encouragement of such as are ingenious and willing to search out gold and silver mines in this province, it is hereby agreed, that they have liberty to bore and dig in any man's property, fully paying the damage done; and in case a discovery should be made, that the discoverer have <HI>one-fifth,</HI> the owner of the soil (if not the discoverer) a tenth part, the Governor <HI>two-fifths,</HI> and the rest to the public treasury, saving to the king the share reserved by patent.</P>
<P N="9">IX. In every <HI>hundred thousand</HI> acres, the Governor and Proprie∣tary, by lot, reserveth ten to himself, what shall lie but in one place.</P>
<P N="10">X. That every man shall be bound to plant, or man, so much of his share of land as shall be set out and surveyed, within <HI>three</HI> years after it is so set out and surveyed, or else it shall be lawful for new comers to be settled thereupon, paying to them their sur∣vey money, and they go up higher for their shares.</P>
<P N="11">XI. There shall be no buying and selling, be it with an <HI>Indian,</HI> or one among another, of any goods to be exported, but what shall be performed in public market, when such placed shall be set apart, or erected, where they shall pass the public stamp, or mark. If bad ware, and prized as good, or deceitful in propor∣tion or weight, to forfeit the value, as if good and full weight and proportion, to the public treasury of this province, whether it be the merchandize of the <HI>Indian,</HI> or that of the planters.</P>
<P N="12">XII. And forasmuch, as it is usual with the planters to over∣reach the poor natives of the country, in trade, by goods not be∣ing good of the kind, or debased with mixtures, with which they are sensibly aggrieved, it is agreed, whatever is sold to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in consideration of their furs, shall be sold in the market place, and there suffer the test, whether good or bad; if good, to pass; if not good, not to be sold for good, that the natives may not be abused, nor provoked.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="4" REF="034421_0377_0FFEA81CF8B597E8"/>XIII. That no man shall, by any ways or means, in word, or deed, affront, or wrong any <HI>Indian,</HI> but he shall incur the same penalty of the law, as if he had committed it against his fellow planter, and if any <HI>Indian</HI> shall abuse, in word, or deed, any planter of this province, that he shall not be his own judge upon the <HI>Indian,</HI> but he shall make his complaint to the Governor of the province, or his Lieutenant, or Deputy, or some inferior Magistrate near him, who shall, to the utmost of his power, take care with the king of the said <HI>Indian,</HI> that all reasonable satisfaction be made to the said injured planter.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That all differences, between the planters and the natives, shall also be ended by <HI>twelve</HI> men, that is, by six planters and six natives; that so we may live friendly together as much as in us lieth, preventing all occasions of heart-burnings and mischief.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That the <HI>Indians</HI> shall have liberty to do all things relating to improvement of their ground, and providing sustenance for their families, that any of the planters shall enjoy.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. That the laws, as to slanders, drunkenness, swearing, cursing, pride in apparel, trespasses, distresses, replevins, weights, and measures, shall be the same as in <HI>England,</HI> till altered by law in this province.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That all shall mark their hogs, sheep and other cattle, and what are not marked within <HI>three</HI> months after it is in their possession, be it young or old, it shall be forfeited to the Governor, that so people may be compelled to avoid the occasions of much strife between planters.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That, in clearing the ground, care be taken to leave <HI>one</HI> acre of trees for every <HI>five</HI> acres cleared, especially to preserve oak and mulberries, for silk and shipping.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That all ship-masters shall give an account of their coun∣tries, names, ships, owners, freights and passengers, to an officer to be appointed for that purpose, which shall be registered within two days after their arrival, and if they shall refuse so to do, that then none presume to trade with them, upon forfeiture thereof; and that such masters be looked upon as having an evil intention to the province.</P>
<P N="20">XX. That no person leave the province, without publication being made thereof, in the market place, three weeks before, and a certificate from some Justice of the Peace, of his clearness with his neighbours and those he dealt with, so far as such an assurance can be attained and given: and if any master of a ship shall, con∣trary hereunto, receive and carry away any person, that hath not
<PB N="5" REF="034421_0378_0FFDA08D89F3FD28"/>
given that public notice, the said master shall be liable to all debts owing by the said person, so secretly transported from the province.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The frame of the government of the province of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> in <HI>America:</HI> together with certain <HI>laws</HI> agreed upon in <HI>England,</HI> by the Governor and divers freemen of the aforesaid province. To be further explained and confirmed there, by the first provincial Coun∣cil, that shall be held, if they see meet.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the great and wise <HI>God</HI> had made the world, of all his creatures, it pleased him to chuse man his Deputy to rule it: and to sit him for so great a charge and trust, he did not only qualify him with skill and power, but with integrity to use them justly. This native goodness was equally his honour and his hap∣piness; and whilst he stood here, all went well; there was no need of coercive or compulsive means; the precept of divine love
<PB N="6" REF="034421_0379_0FFEA8A3C2DA87A0"/>
and truth, in his bosom, was the guide and keeper of his innocency. But lust prevailing against duty, made a lamentable breach upon it; and the law, that before had no power over him, took place upon him, and his disobedient posterity, that such as would not live conformable to the holy law within, should fall under the reproof and correction of the just law without, in a judicial ad∣ministration.</P>
<P>This the Apostle teaches in divers of his epistles: "The law (says he) was added because of transgression:" In another place, "Knowing that the law was not made for the righteous man; but for the disobedient and ungodly, for sinners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, and for manstealers, for lyers, for per∣jured persons," &amp;c. but this is not all, he opens and carries the matter of government a little further: "Let every soul be sub∣ject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of <HI>God.</HI> The powers that be are ordained of <HI>God:</HI> whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of <HI>God.</HI> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil; wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same." "He is the minister of God to thee for good." "Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but for conscience sake."</P>
<P>This settles the divine right of government beyond exception, and that for two ends: first, to terrify evil doers; secondly, to cherish those that do well; which gives government a life beyond corruption, and makes it as durable in the world, as good men should be. So that government seems to me a part of religion it∣self, a thing sacred in its institution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cause, it crushes the effects of evil, and is as such, (though a lower, yet) an emanation of the same Divine Pow∣er, that is both author and object of pure religion; the difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compulsive in its operations: but that is only to evil doers; government itself being otherwise as capable of kindness, goodness and charity, as a more private society. They weakly err, that think there is no other use of government, than correc∣tion, which is the coarsest part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more soft, and daily necessary, make up much the greatest part of government; and which must have followed the peopling of the world, had Adam never fell, and will continue among men, on earth, under the highest attainments they may arrive at, by the coming of the
<PB N="7" REF="034421_0380_0FFDA0B5AB93F9B0"/>
blessed <HI>Second Adam,</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> from heaven. Thus much of go∣vernment in general, as to its rise and end.</P>
<P>For particular <HI>frames</HI> and <HI>models,</HI> it will become me to say little; and comparatively I will say nothing. My reasons are:—</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the age is too nice and difficult for it; there being nothing the wits of men are more busy and divided upon. It is true, they seem to agree to the end, to wit, happiness; but, in the means, they differ, as to divine, so to this human felicity; and the cause is much the same, not always want of light and knowledge, but want of using them rightly. Men side with their passions against their reason, and their sinister interests have so strong a bias upon their minds, that they lean to them against the good of the things they know.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I do not find a model in the world, that time, place, and some singular emergences have not necessarily altered; nor is it easy to frame a civil government, that shall serve all places alike.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I know what is said by the several admirers of <HI>monar∣chy, aristocracy</HI> and <HI>democracy,</HI> which are the rule of one, a few, and many, and are the three common ideas of government, when men discourse on the subject. But I chuse to solve the controversy with this small distinction, and it belongs to all three: <HI>Any govern∣ment is free to the people under it</HI> (whatever be the frame) <HI>where the laws rule, and the people are a party to those laws,</HI> and more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, or confusion.</P>
<P>But, lastly, when all is said, there is hardly one frame of go∣vernment in the world so ill designed by its first founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and story tells us, the best, in ill ones, can do nothing that is great or good; witness the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> states. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, so by them they are ruined too. Wherefore go∣vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let the government be never so good, they will endeavour to warp and spoil it to their turn.</P>
<P>I know some say, let us have good laws, and no matter for the men that execute them: but let them consider, that though good laws do well, good men do better: for good laws may want good men, and be abolished or evaded by ill men; but good men will never want good laws, nor suffer ill ones. It is true, good laws have some awe upon ill ministers, but that is where they have not power to escape or abolish them, and the people are generally wise and
<PB N="8" REF="034421_0381_0FFEA8A7497518C8"/>
good: but a loose and depraved people (which is to the question) love laws and an administration like themselves. That, therefore, which makes a good constitution, must keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> men of wis∣dom and virtue, qualities, that because they descend not with worldly inheritances, must be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth; for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders, and the successive magistracy, than to their parents, for their private patrimonies.</P>
<P>These considerations of the weight of government, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it uneasy to me to think of publishing the ensuing frame and conditional laws, foreseeing both the censures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occasion they may give of dis∣course beyond my design.</P>
<P>But, next to the power of necessity, (which is a solicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have (with reverence to God, and good conscience to men) to the best of our skill, contrived and composed the <HI>frame</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of this government, to the great end of all government, viz. <HI>To support power in reverence with the people, and to secure the people from the abuse of power;</HI> that they may be free by their just obedience, and the magistrates honourable, for their just administration: for liberty without obedience is confusion, and obedience without liberty is slavery. To carry this evenness is partly owing to the constitution, and partly to the magistracy: where either of these fail, govern∣ment will be subject to convulsions; but where both are wanting, it must be totally subverted: then where both meet, the government is like to endure. Which I humbly pray and hope <HI>God</HI> will please to make the lot of this of <HI>Pensilvania.</HI> Amen.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Frame of Government of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and the territories thereunto belonging, passed by Governor <HI>Markham,</HI> November <HI>7, 1696.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1696.</NOTE>WHEREAS the late king Charles the Second, in the three and thirtieth year of his reign, by letters pa∣tent under the great seal of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th mo. 7th.</NOTE> did, for the con∣siderations therein mentioned, grant unto <HI>William Penn,</HI> his heirs and assigns, for ever, this colony, or tract of land, thereby erecting the same into a province, called <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and constituting him, the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> absolute Proprietary thereof, vesting him, his De∣puties and Lieutenants, with divers great powers, pre-eminences, royalties, jurisdictions and authorities, ne∣cessary for the well-being and good government of the said province. And whereas the late duke of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> &amp;c. for valuable considerations, did grant unto the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> his heirs and assigns, all that tract of land which hath been cast, or divided into three coun∣ties, now called <HI>Newcastle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> together with all royalties, franchises, duties, jurisdictions, liber∣ties and privileges thereunto belonging; which last men∣tioned tract being intended as a beneficial and requisite addition to the territory of the said Proprietary, he, the said Proprietary and Governor, at the request of the freemen of the said three counties, by their deputies, in Assembly met, with the representatives of the freemen of the said province at <HI>Chester,</HI> alias <HI>Upland,</HI> on the sixth day of the tenth month, 1682, did (with the advice and consent of the Members of the said Assembly) enact, that the said three counties should be annexed to the pro∣vince of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as the proper territories thereof: and whereas king <HI>William</HI> and the late queen <HI>Mary,</HI> over <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. by their letters patent and commission, un∣der the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> dated the twenty-first day of October, in the fourth year of their reign, having, (for the reasons therein mentioned) taken the government of this said province and territories into their hands, and under their care and protection, did think fit to consti∣tute
<PB N="31" REF="034421_0404_0FFDA1E46F950F90"/>
<HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> Governor of New York, to be their Captain General, and Governor in Chief, over this province and country. And whereas also the said king and queen afterwards, by their letters patent, under the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> dated the twentieth day of Au∣gust, in the sixth year of their reign, have thought fit, upon the humble application of the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> to restore them to the administration of the government of the said province and territories; and that so much of their said commission as did constitute the said <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> their Captain General and Governor in Chief of the said province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> country of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> and the territories and tracts of land depending thereupon, in <HI>America,</HI> together with all the powers and authorities thereby granted for the ruling and governing their said province and country, should, from the publi∣cation of the said last recited letters patent, cease, deter∣mine and become void; and accordingly the same are hereby declared void; whereupon the said <HI>William Penn</HI> did commissionate his kinsman, <HI>William Markham,</HI> Go∣vernor under him, with directions to act according to the known laws and usages of this government.</P>
<P>Now forasmuch as the former frame of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elections appointed.</NOTE> modelled by act of settlement, and charter of liberties, is not deemed, in all respects, suitably accommodated to our present circumstances, therefore it is unanimously desired that it may be enacted, And be it enacted by the Governor aforesaid, with the advice and consent of the representatives of the freemen of the said province and territories, in Assembly met, and by the authority of the same, that this government shall, from time to time, consist of the Governor, or his Deputy, or Deputies, and the freemen of the said province, and territories thereof, in form of a Council and Assembly; which Council and Assembly shall be men of most note for virtue, wisdom and ability; and shall, from and after the tenth day of the first month next, consist of two per∣sons out of each of the counties of this government, to serve as the people's representatives in Council; and of four persons out of each of the said counties, to serve as their representatives in Assembly; for the electing of which representatives, it shall and may be lawful to and for all the freemen of this province and territories afore∣said, to meet together on the tenth day of the first month
<PB N="32" REF="034421_0405_0FFDA1384B9ABBD0"/>
yearly hereafter, in the most convenient and usual place for election, within the respective counties, then and there to chuse their said representatives as aforesaid, who shall meet on the tenth day of the third month yearly, in the capital town of the said province, unless the Go∣vernor and Council shall think fit to appoint another place.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Address of the Assembly to the Proprietary, concerning property, September <HI>20, 1701.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the representatives of the freemen of the province and territories, in Assembly met, having taken into serious considera∣tion some articles concerning our privileges in property, incited by an address to this house from the inhabitants of this place, and encouraged by thyself, in setting forth thy care of us, and pro∣mises of compliance therewith, do humbly offer the following heads for confirmation, requesting they may be granted the peo∣ple of the province and territories, and ascertained to them in a charter.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Imprimis,</HI> That, in case the Proprietary go for <HI>England,</HI> due care be taken that he be represented here by persons of integrity, and considerable known estates, who may have full power and authority, not only to grant and confirm lands, &amp;c. as if he were personally present, but also to make satisfaction to those who have short, as well as receive what may be due from those who have too much over measure, according to former agreement.</P>
<P N="2">II. That before the Proprietary go for <HI>England,</HI> he grant us such an instrument as may absolutely secure and defend us in our estates and properties, from himself, his heirs and assigns, for ever, or any claiming under him, them, or any of them, as also to clear all <HI>Indian</HI> purchases and others.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, whereas there hath been great delay in the confirm∣ation of land, and granting of patents, due care may be taken by the Proprietary, that no such delays may be for the future; and that the ten acres in the hundred may be allowed, according to the Proprietary's engagements.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That no Surveyor, Secretary, or any other officer under the Proprietary, presume to exact or take any fees, but what were, are, or shall be allowed by the laws of this province, under severe penalties.</P>
<P N="5">V. That no person, or persons, shall, or may, at any time hereafter, be liable to answer any complaint, matter or thing what∣soever, relating to property, before the Governor, or his Council, or in any other place, but in the ordinary courts of justice.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="41" REF="034421_0414_0FFDA19159B86190"/>VI. That the ancient records made before the Proprietary's first arrival here, be lodged in such hands as the Assembly shall judge to be most fit.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That a patent office, and all actual Surveyors thereby em∣ployed, may be modelled according to the law of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and such security taken, as may render the people's interest safe.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That, whereas the Proprietary formerly gave the pur∣chasers an expectation of a certain tract of land, which is since laid out, about two miles long, and one mile broad, whereon to build the town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and that the same should be a free gift; which since has been clogged with divers rents and reserva∣tions contrary to the first design and grant, and to the great dissa∣tisfaction of the inhabitants: we desire the Governor to take it into consideration, and make them easy therein.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the land, lying back of that part of the town already built, remain for common, and that no leases for the future, to make inclosures to the damage of the public, until such time as the respective owners shall be ready to build or improve thereon; and that the islands and flats near the town, be left to the inhabi∣tants of this town to get their winter fodder.</P>
<P N="10">X. That the streets of the town be regulated and bounded, and that the ends of the streets on <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Sculkil</HI> be unlimited, and left free to be extended on the river as the inhabitants shall see meet; and that public landing places at the <HI>Blue Anchor</HI> and <HI>Penny Pot</HI> house be confirmed free to the inhabitants of this town, not infringing any man's property.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the Justices may have the licensing and regulating or∣dinaries and drinking houses, as in <HI>England;</HI> and as by thy letter, dated November 5, 1697, did order.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That the letters of feoffment for the soil of the three lower counties, from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> be recorded in the terri∣tories.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That all lands, in the said counties not yet taken up, may be disposed of at the old rent, of a bushel of wheat a hun∣dred.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That the thousand acres of land, formerly promised by the Governor to the town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for common, be laid out and patented for that use.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That the bank lots at <HI>Newcastle</HI> be granted to those that have the front lots, to low-water mark; or so far as they may im∣prove, at a bushel of wheat a lot.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="42" REF="034421_0415_0FFDA219BA590AD0"/>XVI. That all the bay marshes be laid out for common, except such as are already granted.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That all patents hereafter to be granted to the territories, be on the same conditions, as the warrants or grants were obtained.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That the division lines between the counties of <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> be ascertained, allowing the bounds according to the Proprietary's letters patent from the king.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That the twenty-second article in the old charter, con∣cerning fishing and fowling, be confirmed.</P>
<P N="20">XX. That the inhabitants or possessors of land may have liberty to purchase off their quit-rents, as formerly promised.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That the bill of property passed at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> 1700, be in∣serted in the charter, with such amendments as shall be agreed on.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Signed by order of the House,</HI> JOSEPH GROWDON, <HI>Speaker.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The answer of the Proprietary and Governor to the preceding address of the Assembly, head by head.</HEAD>
<P>To the first I shall appoint those, in whom I can confide, whose powers shall be sufficient and public for the security of all con∣cerned; and I hope they shall be of honest character, without just exception, to do that which is right between you and me.</P>
<P N="2">II. Much of it is included in my answer to the first; however, I am willing to execute a public instrument, or charter to secure you in your properties, according to purchase, and the law of property made lately at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> excepting some corrections, or amendments, absolutely necessary, therein.</P>
<P N="3">III. I know of no wilful delays, and shall use my endeavours to prevent any for the future, and am very willing to allow the ten acres per cent. for the ends proposed by the law, and not otherwise.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I am willing that reasonable fees to officers shall be ascer∣tained by law, or their services left to a <HI>quantum meruit;</HI> for I hope you do not think they should be maintained at my charge.</P>
<P N="5">V. I know of no person, that has been obliged to answer be∣fore the Governor and Council, in such cases; but I conceive that disputes about unconfined properties must lie before the Pro∣prietary, though not before his Council, as judges.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The records concern me, as well as the people, and are, or shall be, in the hands of men of good fame, and to keep them only during good behaviour; but those of this county of <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="034421_0416_0FFDA1C6ED0AA7A8"/>
that chiefly concern the people, are in so great disorder, by razures, blots and interlineations, that you would do well to use some method in time, for their rectification.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If the <HI>Jamaica</HI> law will improve our regulation, as it doth augment the fees, I am content we copy after it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. You are under a mistake, in fact; I have tied you to no∣thing, in the allotment of the city, which the first purchasers, then present, did not readily seem to comply with, and I am sorry to find their names to such an address, as that presented to you, who have got double lots, by my re-aplotment of the city, from fifty to one hundred and two feet front lots; and if they are willing to refund the fifty-two feet, I shall, as you desire, be easy in the quit-rents, although this matter solely refers to the first purchasers, and to me as Proprietary.</P>
<P N="9">IX. You are under a misapprehension, to think that a fourth part of the land, laid out for a city, belongs to any body but my∣self, it being reserved for such as were not first purchasers, who might want to build in future time; and when I reflect upon the great abuse, done in my absence, by destroying of my timber and wood, and how the land is over-run with brush, to the injury and discredit of the town, it is small encouragement to grant your re∣quest; however, I am content that some land be laid out for the ac∣commodation of the town, till inhabitants present to settle it under regulations that shall be thought most conducing to the end de∣sired, about which, I shall consult with those persons chiefly con∣cerned therein; and for the rest of the ninth article, about the islands, I know not which you mean, nor on what terms desired, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being an independant property from the town, if not from the province.</P>
<P N="10">X. About the ends of streets, and other public landings of this town, I am willing to grant the ends of streets, when and where improved, and the other according to your request.</P>
<P N="11">XI. I am contented that no licences be granted to any ordinary keepers, but such as the Justices shall recommend, nor suffer them longer, than the Magistrates find they behave well.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I do not understand it; for I had no letters of feoffment, but deeds, which were recorded by <HI>Ephraim Harman,</HI> at <HI>Newcas∣tle,</HI> and by <HI>John West,</HI> to the best of my memory, at <HI>New York,</HI> and since confirmed by the order of Council, for the line, as well as otherwise, and a most formal possession and obedience given me in pursuance thereof.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="44" REF="034421_0417_0FFDA1BDB212B5D8"/>XIII. I think this an unreasonable article, either to limit me in that which is my own, or to deprive me of the benefit of raising in proportion to the advantage, which time gives to other men's properties; and the rather, because I am yet in disburse for that long and expensive controversy with the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> promised to be defrayed by the public, as appears by the minutes of Council.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I allow it, according to what I lately expressed at <HI>New∣castle,</HI> and it is not my fault it has not been done sooner.</P>
<P N="15">XV. According to their own proposals, at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> I shall gratify their desire, <HI>viz.</HI> that the same revert to me, after a cer∣tain time, if not improved.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. This I take for a high imposition; however, I am willing that they all lye in common and free, until otherwise disposed of, and shall grant the same from time to time, in reasonable portions, and upon reasonable terms, especially to such as shall engage to drain and improve the same; having always a regard to back in∣habitants, for their accommodations.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. I cannot well understand it; therefore it must be ex∣plained.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. It is my own inclination, and I desire and expect the representatives of <HI>Newcastle</HI> and Chester forthwith, or before they leave the town, to attend me about the time and method of do∣ing it.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. They shall have liberty to fish, fowl and hunt, upon their own lands, and upon all other lands that are mine untaken up.</P>
<P N="20">XX. If it should be my lot to lose a public support, I must de∣pend upon my rents for a supply; and therefore must not easily part with them; and many years are elapsed since I made that offer, that was not excepted.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. I agree that the law of property, made at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> shall be inserted in the charter, with requisite amendments.</P>

<P><HI>To</HI> William Denny, <HI>Esquire, Lieutenant Governor and Commander in Chief of the province of</HI> Pennsylvania, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Address</HI> of the Trustees and Treasurer of the <HI>Friendly Asso∣ciation,</HI> for regaining and preserving peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> by pacific measures,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER>Respectfully sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT on consideration of the answer given by the Governor to our offer of contributing towards the expence of the ensuing treaty with the <HI>Indians,</HI> we apprehend it to be necessary to lay be∣fore him a true state of the motives, which induced us to use our endeavours to promote a reconciliation with them; of the manner, in which we proceeded before and since the Governor's arrival in this province, and of some reasons we have for desiring to see that the grounds of their complaints are carefully and im∣partially enquired into and considered, and such measures pursued,
<PB N="56" REF="034421_0429_0FFDA1EBCFB2F778"/>
for satisfying them as the present melancholy circumstances of this province immediately require: and we doubt not, if the Governor will be pleased to attend to, and impartially consider, what we shall offer, he will be fully convinced that our conduct hath been con∣sistent with the profession, we make, of acting on those principles, of fearing God, honouring the king, and promoting peace among men.</P>
<P>We, therefore, beg leave to inform the Governor, that soon after the first accounts were brought of the mischief done by the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the frontiers of <HI>Virginia,</HI> some of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> residing in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> seriously considering the fatal consequences of losing that interest and friendship our predecessors had obtained, by their upright dealing and hospitable treatment of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the first settlement of this province; and appre∣hending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general neglect of them, which had, for some time, been obvious, would terminate to the public disadvantage, deter∣mined to improve every future opportunity of manifesting some regard to them; and several companies of <HI>Indians,</HI> of different tribes, coming to this city on divers occasions, they were visited by some of us, invited to our houses, and on their going away, presented with some small matters, necessary for them, in their way of living; and the grateful manner in which they received these instances of regard, and the lively remembrance, they ap∣peared to retain, of the friendship, which subsisted between their ancestors, and the first settlers of this province, afforded us real satisfaction, and some grounds to hope our good intentions would not be disappointed.</P>
<P>During the following winter, the frequent melancholy ac∣counts of the barbarous murders, committed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the western and northern frontiers of this province, filled the minds of people in general, with a spirit of indignation and re∣sentment against them, and no opportunity presented of publicly manifesting the earnest concern we had, to use our utmost endea∣vours, in a manner consistent with our peaceable principles, to prevent the impending desolation; the calamity became general, and every one was deeply interested in the measures taken for en∣quiring into the causes, which induced our ancient steady friends to become our enemies: yet this being the proper business of those then concerned in the administration of the government, we waited the event of their proceedings, having just grounds to hope, that the knowledge some of them had of several matters, which might probably have contributed to this unhappy rupture,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were printed both in the gazettes and in their minutes.</NOTE>
<PB N="57" REF="034421_0430_0FFDA20591201820"/>
together with the repeated applications of the Assembly of the province, would have excited them to pursue every rational me∣thod of making such an enquiry, and obtaining an amicable ad∣justment of all differences with these <HI>Indians,</HI> and of thereby averting the melancholy consequences of continuing to expose them immediately to the artifices of the <HI>French,</HI> who would not fail to take advantage of our misunderstanding with them: but the spring of another year returned, and the public remained un∣acquainted with such measures being pursued; great military preparations were indeed made and sorts erected in many parts of the frontiers, but the desolation and distress of the province in∣creased, and the sanguine expectations of the people, who had, at first, hoped by these means to defend themselves, were remark∣ably disappointed. Governor <HI>Morris,</HI> nevertheless, determining to issue a declaration of war against the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese,</HI> many of the people called <HI>Quakers</HI> residing in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> met together and presented an address to him, earnestly beseeching, "That every measure which had been pursued, and whatever remained possible to be done, to prevent so lamentable an extre∣mity, might be strictly and impartially reviewed and considered; that full enquiry might be made, whether some apprehensions these <HI>Indians</HI> had conceived of a deviation from the integrity of con∣duct towards them, conspicuous in the first establishment, might not unhappily have contributed, in some degree, to the alteration of their conduct towards us; that full time might be allowed for these <HI>Indians,</HI> who remained well affected towards us, to use and report the effect of their endeavours to reconcile our enemies to us, and that, by the Governor's care, to guard against involv∣ing the innocent with the guilty, such clear demonstrations of Christian tenderness might be given, as might tend to the engag∣ing other neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI> in the desirable work of restoring peace and tranquillity; and, at the same time, offering, though a much larger part of their estates should be necessary, than the heaviest taxes of a war could be expected to require, by voluntary grants chearfully to contribute towards the obtaining peace, in the same manner as the unhappy experience of several of the most martial neighbouring colonies had, after long and bloody wars, testified it must at last, if ever, be obtained."</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was pleased to give a civil answer to this ad∣dress; but thought it necessary to proceed immediately to a decla∣ration of war: a few days after which, some of us having the opportunity of a free conference with <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> who had, as provincial interpreter, been long concerned in public transac∣tions with the <HI>Indians;</HI> we were thereby confirmed in our appre∣hensions,
<PB N="58" REF="034421_0431_0FFDA1AFB6AF3CB0"/>
that some dissatisfaction, respecting their lands, had tended to the alienating their friendship from us; and that he thought the only method, to save the province from ruin, was to endeavour for a peace with them, by <HI>pacific measures;</HI> and the next day a <HI>Delaware Indian,</HI> from the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> was sent to one of us, with a letter from <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> recommending him, as a person worthy of some notice from us, and fit to be employed on a message to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> when an opportunity of sending one could be obtained; and there being, at that time, a number of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> in town, some of us thought it necessary to take some friendly notice of them; but being de∣termined to avoid giving any occasion of offence, before we had any conversation with them, two of us waited on Governor <HI>Mor∣ris,</HI> and informed him, "That as he had issued his declaration of war, we thought it our duty to acquiesce therein; but, as there were some <HI>friendly Indians</HI> in town, we were disposed to take some notice of them, and to endeavour, by a friendly conver∣sation, to manifest our good disposition towards them, and engage their good offices on any occasion, which might be improved for the public welfare; and we, at the same time, assured the Go∣vernor if any thing should occur, which had a prospect of tend∣ing to the public interest, or might be worthy of his notice, he should be fully acquainted therewith." The Governor expressed his approbation of our design, and gave us full liberty to prose∣cute our intentions, and the next day some of these <HI>Indian Chiefs,</HI> with <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> and <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> the provincial interpre∣ters, and <HI>D. Claus,</HI> General <HI>Johnson</HI>'s Secretary, dined at one of our houses; and after dinner, had some conversation on the happy state of the first settlers of this province, and the unhappy rup∣ture, which had lately happened.</P>
<P>The free and hearty acknowledgments of pleasure and gratitude, from these <HI>Indians,</HI> fully evidenced their good disposition towards us, and induced <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> to declare, he had not lately heard them express themselves with so much openness, and earnestly to urge our improving this opportunity; and, in order to it, he advised the calling together as many of our ancient men, of the survivors of the first settlers, as we could collect, and to give the <HI>Indians</HI> another meeting, in which the substance of that conversation might be repeated, and enforced on their minds, by presenting them with a belt of <HI>wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was immediately informed of what had passed; and as there appeared some prospect of improving this disposition of the <HI>Indians</HI> to the public benefit, he was assured, that if he would advise and direct the manner of proceeding, nothing more
<PB N="59" REF="034421_0432_0FFDA13FE72126A0"/>
was desired by us than under his direction to proceed therein, in such manner as would be most agreeable to him, most effectually answer the purpose intended, and demonstrate that we did not act from views of private advantage thereby: and lest the differences then subsisting, between him and the Assembly, about the raising money for the public services, should discourage, or retard his en∣gaging therein; he was told, that whatever sum of money should be wanting, even, to the amount of £. 5,000, he should be im∣mediately supplied with, and by every part of our conduct, should find our hearty concern for the public welfare to be our principal motive.</P>
<P>Our purposes appeared acceptable to the Governor; about twenty of us, with the same interpreters, had two conferences with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and the most material parts of what they said were immediately communicated to the Governor; and the pro∣posal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was made by the <HI>Indians Chiefs,</HI> and the message to be from them to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> of sending three messengers to the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawa∣nese</HI> being approved of by him, the necessary provision was made for their setting out, and proper company provided, for their safe conduct through the improved part of the province; and when they were ready to proceed on their journey, the Governor being waited on for the passes, and requested to direct what signal they should give, on their return, to distinguish them from enemies; while the passes lay before him ready to be signed, he suddenly appeared to change his intentions, and signified his resolution to consult his Council, on the occasion. The minutes of our con∣versation with these <HI>Indians,</HI> being examined and signed by the three interpreters, were immediately, after this, delivered to the Governor; and, his Council being summoned, we were informed, they soon agreed, that, as he had so lately declared war, any of∣fers of peace from him would be unseasonable, and that the me∣thod first proposed of the messengers going with such instructions, as they had received from their own <HI>chiefs,</HI> was most fit to be pur∣sued. The next day the <HI>Indian chiefs</HI> setting out in the stage boat for <HI>New York,</HI> after they were gone, the messengers refused to per∣form the service they had undertaken, and the day following, the Governor, in consequence of some intelligence received from the Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> concluded to send the messengers in his own name.</P>
<P>To prevent any misrepresentations of our conduct, as well as to engage the friendship of gentlemen, from whom we hoped to receive more hearty assistance, than we had from those, on whom
<PB N="60" REF="034421_0433_0FFDA2217AB7E7F8"/>
we had hitherto depended, copies of the minutes of our conversations with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their answers, were immediately sent to the Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> and to General <HI>Johnson,</HI> and an earnest application for their assistance, in engaging the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to promote the restoration of peace, with an offer of chearfully defraying the expences thereof, Governor <HI>Hardy</HI> was so kind as to send such an answer as evidenced his hearty concern for the public welfare; and laid us under sensible obligations; and we never received the least hint, from General <HI>Johnson,</HI> of his disapprobation of any part of our conduct therein. Under these circumstances, we had reason to apprehend that our intention was approved of, and the speedy return of the messengers with an agreeable answer, confirmed us in a resolution to continue our en∣deavours to engage as many of our fellow-subjects, as possible, to concur with us therein.</P>
<P>The messengers being sent the second time, on their return brought with them the <HI>Indian king, Teedyuscung,</HI> and some of his people, to <HI>Easton,</HI> and repeatedly informed us of the necessity of our personal attendance there, and manifest thereby, and by contributing towards the expences of a suitable present, the sin∣cerity of our professions of regard to them; and they were not willing to go back to the <HI>Indians,</HI> without us.</P>
<P>We, therefore, being informed that Governor Morris had re∣solved to meet them at <HI>Easton,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The votes of Assembly prove it.</NOTE> that the provincial treasury was exhausted, and that the Proprietaries' agents refused to contribute towards the necessary expences, and appeared averse to the pro∣motion of these <HI>pacific measures,</HI> a considerable number of us thought it necessary to enter into a subscription, towards raising a fund, to supply the deficiency of what ought, in justice, to be contributed by the Proprietaries, on this occasion; and a consider∣able sum was immediately subscribed, and Governor <HI>Morris</HI> in∣formed of our inclination to attend the treaty, and to make some addition to the present provided at the public expence. From the time of the first messengers arriving at <HI>Teaogon,</HI> the hostilities on our northern frontiers ceased, and a stop being put to the cruel devastations that had been committed, an acceptable respite was obtained for our distressed fellow subjects, which afforded us real pleasure and satisfaction; so that all the malicious calumnies and aspersions (which then were uttered) were not sufficient to divert us from the steady prosecution of our purpose. Governor <HI>Morris</HI> being at <HI>Easton</HI> some time before us, immediately after our arrival there, some of us waited on him, to repeat our desires of promot∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="034421_0434_0FFDA1F01C98F7F8"/>
the public interest, and contributing any assistance in our power, in such manner as might be most agreeable to him; he re∣ceived us civilly, and expressed his approbation of our design. At the Governor's lodgings we first saw <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> chief, to whom we were before utterly strangers: on our coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he immediately expressed his regard for, and confidence in, the <HI>Quakers;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was in the hearing of Governor Morris.</NOTE> and declared, "He would not proceed to any business, unless we were present;" and confirmed it so evidently by his sub∣sequent conduct, at that time, and the ensuing treaty, that we could not, without unjustifiable neglect of our duty, decline con∣tributing our utmost endeavours to improve this disposition to the interest of our country, so far as we might be able to do it, con∣sistent with our respective stations in life.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was afterwards pleased to accept of the pre∣sent provided by us, and to deliver it to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in our name.</P>
<P>After the conclusion of this treaty, Governor <HI>Morris</HI> thought a necessary to send Capt. <HI>Newcastle</HI> on a message to the <HI>Indians,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or near fort <HI>Johnson:</HI> but before he was set out, Governor <HI>Denny</HI> arrived, and succeeded in the government of this province, and we always apprehended, that, in his name, and by his authority, Capt. <HI>Newcastle</HI> went on that message, as we never interfered there∣in, in any manner whatever, and were not informed the particular business he was charged with. On Captain <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s return, we found by conversing with him, he had given some offence to Ge∣neral <HI>Johnson,</HI> and we have since had cause to apprehend <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From the account given by General <HI>Johnson</HI> to the Earl of <HI>London</HI> of this jour∣ney of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> it is thought the Earl was induced to express himself in the man∣ner Governor <HI>Denny</HI> has published in his late messages to the Assembly.</NOTE> that some gentlemen in higher stations, have been informed, that we had sent <HI>Newcastle</HI> on this message, and given him matters in charge, to be privately transacted with the <HI>Indians,</HI> after it was known to us that the king had, by a special commission, autho∣rized Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to negotiate all matters of a public con∣cern with them; but as we had not given any occasion for such a charge, nor were any way concerned in sending that message, it affords us a particular pleasure, that the Governor has given us to favourable an opportunity of clearing ourselves from this unjust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensure, and we hope that this ingenuous account of our conduct, in the course of this business before the Governor's arrival, will fully evince that we proceeded therein on just motives, and with the regard due from us to the Governor of this province.</P>
<P>It is well known to the Governor, that on his arrival here, some of us waited on him, and one of us assured him of our sin∣cere
<PB N="62" REF="034421_0435_0FFDA1DF480CB6F8"/>
desire to proceed in contributing our assistance towards the restoration of peace, in a manner most agreeable to him, and con∣sistent with our characters and stations. He was then pleased to declare his approbation of our purpose; and when we waited on him with our address, before the second treaty of <HI>Easton,</HI> the Go∣vernor, by his answer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This answer was in writing.</NOTE> declared his approbation of our pro∣ceedings, and his being willing to receive the present we prepared, and invited us to attend the treaty: we had reason to conclude, that our conduct there had given the Governor no occasion of offence; as, after the business was finished, on our acknowledging his integrity and candour in the public transactions there;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He thanked us for our company, and said he was glad we were there, and that his conduct was satisfactory to us, and that he should endeavour to act so upon all oc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to deserve our esteem, &amp;c.</NOTE> he gave us such an answer as fully expressed his being well pleased with us; and the Secretary and Provincial Interpreter very libe∣rally declared their satisfaction and approbation of our conduct; and the latter fully testified that we had thereby evidently pro∣moted the public interest, and been instrumental in bringing the business so far towards the desired issue.</P>
<P>From that time till the late treaty at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> we know of no part of our proceedings, which could displease the Governor, un∣less our application to the Secretary, for an inspection of the re∣cords, in his office, had that unexpected effect. Lest that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld be the case, and the intention and manner of that application <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e misrepresented by any of the Proprietaries' Agents, and others en∣gaged with them in the measures, which have contributed to the present unhappy circumstances of this province, we think it neces∣sary to inform the Governor, that this province was settled on terms very different from most of the other colonies; the first ad∣venturers were men of substance and reputation, who purchased the lands of the Proprietor; and as he obliged himself, and his heirs, by an express covenant, contained in their original deeds, "To clear the land from all titles, claims, or demands of the <HI>Indian</HI> natives, or any other persons whatsoever;" they agreed to pay an annual quit-rent, more than sufficient to enable him to satisfy the <HI>Indians,</HI> and obtain a peaceable possession of the land; and during the lives of our first Proprietor, and the first settlers, we believe this was faithfully performed, and so large a balance remained, towards making further purchases, as the settlement of the coun∣try increased, that any attempt to elude the original intention and agreement of honestly purchasing the land of the people, who had a native right in it, will be ever condemned by all impartial and honest men.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="034421_0436_0FFDA1F290C11BB8"/>At the second treaty, at <HI>Easton,</HI> the Governor, by his candid and ingenuous treatment of the <HI>Indians</HI> (as the <HI>Mohawks</HI> since aptly expressed it) "Put his hand into <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>'s bosom, and was to successful as to draw out the secret; which neither Sir William Johnson, nor the <HI>Six Nations</HI> could do." From that time it was generally known, that one cause of the alienation of their friend∣ship was some injustice they had received, or supposed to be done them, in the purchases and running out of their lands. They complained of divers kinds of frauds, which had been committed, repeatedly urged, that an impartial enquiry should be made into the grounds of their complaints, by searching all our records, and by the strong motives of a regard to our temporal and eternal in∣terest, urged the Governor to give liberty to all persons and friends to search into those matters. Thus we thought ourselves under the strongest obligations to make all the enquiry in our power, into the true state of the <HI>Indian</HI> claims, whether or not such care had been taken to purchase, and pay them for the lands, as the Proprietaries' Agents had constantly asserted. The right many of us who hold large tracts of land under the first settlers, the Go∣vernor's repeated declarations, both in public and private, that those matters should be honestly and fully enquired into, and the <HI>Indians'</HI> injunctions that this should be done, not only by the per∣sons thus complained of, or their Agents, but by others likewise interested therein, united in engaging our particular attention, and gave us a reasonable prospect of meeting with the Governor's ap∣probation; and though the Secretary refused to permit us to pro∣ceed therein, by inspecting the records in his office, we still had cause to think our farther application to the necessary and import∣ant concern of regaining peace, was not contrary to the Govern∣or's inclination, as on our informing him of our intention to at∣tend the treaty at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and our willingness to contribute to∣wards the expenses of the present, to be given to the <HI>Indians</HI> there, the Governor with the utmost readiness expressed his approbation of our proposal; and we are not conscious of having, at that treaty, or since, given the least occasion for the alteration of his conduct towards us; which from the answer now received, and the conversion consequent thereon, we have occasion to observe.</P>
<P>We have no views inconsistent with the honour of our gracious king, and the interest of our country, both which we sincerely endeavour to promote; we have heartily desired that people of every denomination, in the province, would unite in the same good purpose, and particularly in this business, that the same har∣mony and good understanding, which subsisted between the first settlers of the province and the natives, might be revived and
<PB N="64" REF="034421_0437_0FFDA2240DFF9E40"/>
maintained, and we have happily succeeded with several religious societies, who have raised funds, and are ready to apply them to∣wards restoring peace: and, if the complaints of the <HI>Indians</HI> ap∣pear to be just, and the Proprietaries and their Agents should re∣fuse to make them such satisfaction as, in justice, they ought to have, rather than the lives of our fellow-subjects should be sacri∣ficed, their properties destroyed, and so large a part of the king's dominions laid waste, they will freely join with us, in contributing towards the satisfying such just claims of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or at least, to pacify them, till the immediate authority of the king, of whose justice and paternal care we have not the least doubt, can be in∣terposed, and justice, equity and mercy be again restored and maintained amongst us.</P>
<P>And, if we are now so happy as to convince the Governor of the integrity of our intentions and conduct, we shall have reason to hope, he will concur with us, in taking the first opportunity of convincing the nobleman he has named, that it must be from some unjust representations, that he was induced to think, "We had presumed to treat with foreign princes, or by acting as medi∣ators, between the government and an independent people, in∣vaded the king's prerogative royal." We apprehend, our duty to God and the king has engaged us in this business; and some of the good effects thereof have already appeared; we, therefore, now again offer the Governor, to contribute something considera∣ble towards the present necessary to be made to the <HI>Indians,</HI> at the ensuing treaty, and by our personal attendance to improve the confidence and good opinion these people have of us, to the pub∣lic benefit.</P>
<P>Should the Governor persist in refusing to accept our present, we assure him, we shall not, by any part of our conduct, give any just occasion to charge us with a disrespectful conduct towards him, and we desire our attendance, at the treaty, may not be con∣sidered as such. The business to be transacted there is of so much consequence to the lives, liberties, and properties of the people of this province, that should we omit to attend there, and depend on the Governor and the King's Agent, receiving all their infor∣mation, on this important occasion, from the Proprietaries' Agents and others, who have, for some years past, been concerned in the transacting <HI>Indian</HI> affairs, we should be deficient of our duty, as <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Englishmen,</HI> denominations, we hold more dear to us, than any other titles, or appellations, whatsoever.</P>

<P>The first journal of <HI>Christian Frederick Post,</HI> from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> on a message from the government of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to the <HI>Delaware, Shawanese,</HI> and <HI>Mingo Indians,</HI> settled there, and formerly in alliance with the <HI>English;</HI> in order to prevail on them to withdraw from the French interest; in the year <HI>1758.</HI> London, printed for John Wilkie, &amp;c. <HI>1759;</HI> with the notes, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHRISTIAN FREDERICK POST was a plain, honest, re∣ligiously disposed <HI>German,</HI> and one of the Moravian brethren; who, from a conscientious opinion of duty, formerly had lived among the <HI>Mohiccon Indians,</HI> with a view to convert them to <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>He had married twice among them, and lived with them seven∣teen years. It was a dangerous undertaking; and though he was an illiterate person, and his narrative seemingly artless and un∣couth, yet being a man of sincerity, acquainted with the <HI>Indian</HI> manners, and the importance of the affair, at that time, being very interesting, the <HI>Indian</HI> custom of treating on public affairs may thereby partly appear, and be entertaining. The event shewed the propriety of using reason, and friendly treatment, or true po∣licy, towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> in preference to force, or violence, when it may be done: the former of which had so long been suc∣cessfully used by the more early settlers of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and the latter so lately attended with unhappy consequences, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>THE JOURNAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>July the</HI> 15th, 1758.—This day I received orders from his ho∣nour, the Governor, to set out on my intended journey, and pro∣ceeded as far as <HI>German Town,</HI> where I found all the <HI>Indians</HI> drunk.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All Indians are excessive fond of rum, and will be drunk whenever they can get it.</NOTE> <HI>Willamegicken</HI> returned to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for a horse, that was promised him.</P>
<P>—16th. This day I waited for the said <HI>Willamegicken</HI> till near noon, and when he came, being very drunk,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All Indians are excessive fond of rum, and will be drunk whenever they can get it.</NOTE> he could proceed no further, so that I left him, and went to <HI>Bethlehem.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Moravian</HI> Brethren's settlement.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="034421_0439_0FFDA22940F9B1E0"/><HI>July</HI> 17th. I arrived at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and prepared for my journey.</P>
<P>—18th. I read over both the last treaties, that at <HI>Easton,</HI> and that at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and made myself acquainted with the particu∣lars of each.</P>
<P>—19th. With much difficulty I persuaded the <HI>Indians</HI> to leave <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and travelled this day no further than <HI>Hayes</HI>'s, having a hard shower of rain.</P>
<P>—20th. Arrived at fort <HI>Allen.</HI></P>
<P>—21st. I called my company together, to know if we should proceed. They complained they were sick, and must rest that day. This day, I think, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> laid many obstacles in my way, and was very much against my proceeding: he said, he was afraid I should never return; and that the Indians would kill me. About dinner time two <HI>Indians</HI> arrived from <HI>Wyoming,</HI> with an account that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>'s son, <HI>Hans Jacob,</HI> was returned, and brought news from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Allegheny Indians. Teedyuscung</HI> then called a Council, and proposed that I should only go to <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and return, with the message his son had brought, to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I made answer, that it was too late, that he should have proposed that in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> for that the writings containing my orders were so drawn, as obliged me to go, though I should lose my life.</P>
<P>—22d. I desired my companions to prepare to set out, upon which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> called them all together in the fort, and pro∣tested against my going. His reasons were, that he was afraid the <HI>Indians</HI> would kill me, or the <HI>French</HI> get me; and if that should be the case he should be very sorry, and did not know what he should do. I gave for answer, "that I did not know what to think of their conduct. It is plain, said I, that the <HI>French</HI> have a <HI>public road</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>India<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> expression meaning free admission.</NOTE> to your towns, yet you will not let your own flesh and blood, the <HI>English,</HI> come near them; which is very hard: and if that be the case, the <HI>French</HI> must be your masters." I ad∣ded, that, if I died in the undertaking, it would be as much for the <HI>Indians</HI> as the <HI>English,</HI> and that I hoped my journey would be of this advantage, that it would be the means of saving the lives of many hundreds of the <HI>Indians:</HI> therefore, I was resolved to go forward, taking my life in my hand, as one ready to part with it for their good. Immediately after I had spoken thus, three rose up and offered to go with me the nearest way; and we concluded to go through the inhabitants, under the Blue mountains to sort <HI>Au∣gusta,</HI> on <HI>Susquahanna;</HI> where we arrived the 25th.</P>
<P>It gave me great pain to observe many plantations deserted and laid waste; and I could not but reflect on the distress, the poor
<PB N="67" REF="034421_0440_0FFDA16634C5F6C8"/>
owners must be drove to, who once lived in plenty; and I prayed the Lord to restore peace and prosperity to the distressed.</P>
<P>At fort <HI>Augusta</HI> we were entertained very kindly, had our horses shod, and one being lame, we exchanged for another. Here we received, by <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Diahogo,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Indian settlement towards the heads of Susquahanna.</NOTE> the disagreeable news that our army was, as they said, entirely cut off at <HI>Ticonderoga,</HI> which dis∣couraged one of my companions, <HI>Lappopetung</HI>'s son, so much, that he would proceed no further. <HI>Shamokin Daniel</HI> here asked me, if I thought he should be satisfied for his trouble in going with me. I told him every body, that did any service for the province, I thought, would be paid.</P>
<P>—27th. They furnished us here with every necessary for our journey, and we set out with good courage. After we rode about ten miles, we were caught in a hard gust of rain.</P>
<P>—28th. We came to <HI>Wekeeponall,</HI> where the road turns off for <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and slept this night at <HI>Queenashawakee.</HI></P>
<P>—29th. We crossed the <HI>Susquahanna</HI> over the <HI>Big Island.</HI> My companions were now very fearful, and this night went a great way out of the road, to sleep without fire, but could not sleep for the musquetoes and vermin.</P>
<P>—30th &amp; 31st. We were glad it was day, that we might set out. We got upon the mountains, and had heavy rains all night. The heavens alone were our covering, and we accepted of all that was poured down from thence.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1st. We saw three hoops <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Little hoops on which the <HI>Indians</HI> stretch and dress the raw s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> on a bush; to one of them there remained some long white hair. Our horses left us, I suppose, not being fond of the dry food on the mountains: with a good deal of trouble we found them again. We slept this night on the same mountain.</P>
<P>—2d. We came across several places where two poles, painted red, were stuck in the ground by the <HI>Indians,</HI> to which they tye the prisoners, when they stop at night, in their return from their incursions. We arrived this night at <HI>Shinglimuhee,</HI> where was another of the same posts. It is a disagreeable and melancholy fight, to see the means they make use of, according to their savage way, to distress others.</P>
<P>—3d. We came to a part of a river called <HI>Tobeco,</HI> over the mountains, a very bad road.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="034421_0441_0FFDA1596DA22CB8"/><HI>August</HI> 4th. We lost one of our horses, and with much dif∣ficulty found him, but were detained a whole day on that account.</P>
<P>I had much conversation with <HI>Pisquetumen;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Indian</HI> Chief, that travelled with him.</NOTE> of which I think to inform myself further when I get to my journey's end.</P>
<P>—5th. We set out early this day, and made a good long stretch, crossing the big river <HI>Tobeco,</HI> and lodged between two mountains. I had the misfortune to lose my pocket book with three pounds five shillings,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The money of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> being paper, is chiefly carried in pocket books.</NOTE> and sundry other things. What writings it con∣tained were illegible to any body but myself.</P>
<P>—6th. We passed all the mountains, and the big river, <HI>Wesha∣waucks,</HI> and crossed a fine meadow two miles in length, where we slept that night, having nothing to eat.</P>
<P>—7th. We came in sight of fort <HI>Venango,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> situate between two mountains, in a fork of the <HI>Ohio</HI> river. I prayed the Lord to blind them, as he did the enemies of <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>Elisha,</HI> that I might pass unknown. When we arrived, the fort being on the other side of the river, we hallooed, and desired them to fetch us over; which they were afraid to do; but shewed us a place where we might ford. We slept that night within half gun shot of the fort.</P>
<P>—8th. This morning I hunted for my horse, round the fort, within ten yards of it. The Lord heard my prayer, and I passed unknown till we had mounted our horses to go off, when two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> came to take leave of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were much sur∣prised at seeing me, but said nothing.</P>
<P>By what I could learn of <HI>Pisquetumen,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who went into the fort, the garrison consisted of only six men, and an officer blind of one eye. They enquired much of the <HI>Indians</HI> concerning the <HI>English,</HI> whether they knew of any party coming to attack them, of which they were very apprehensive.</P>
<P>—9th. Heavy rains all night and day: we slept on swampy ground.</P>
<P>—10th. We imagined we were near <HI>Kushkushkee;</HI> and having travelled three miles, we met three <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> who appeared ve∣ry shy of us, but said nothing more than to enquire, whether we knew of any <HI>English</HI> coming against fort <HI>Venango.</HI></P>
<P>After we travelled two miles farther, we met with an <HI>Indian,</HI> and one that I took to be a runagade <HI>English Indian</HI> trader; he spoke good <HI>English,</HI> was very curious in examining every thing,
<PB N="69" REF="034421_0442_0FFDA15B1B289360"/>
particularly the silver medal about Pisquitumen's neck. He ap∣peared by his countenance to be guilty. We enquired of them where we were, and found we were lost, and within twenty miles of fort <HI>Duquesne.</HI> We struck out of the road to the right, and slept between two mountains; and being destitute of food, two went to hunt, and the others to seek a road, but to no purpose.</P>
<P>—11th. We went to the place were they had killed two deers, and <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> and I roasted the meat. Two went to hunt for the road, to know which way we should go: one came back, and had found a road; the other lost himself.</P>
<P>—12th. The rest of us hunted for him, but in vain; so, as we could not find him, we concluded to set off, leaving such marks, that, if he returned, he might know which way to follow us; and we left him some meat. We came to the river <HI>Conaquonashon,</HI> where was an old <HI>Indian</HI> town. We were then fifteen miles from <HI>Kushkushkee.</HI></P>
<P>There we stopt, and sent forward <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> with four strings of <HI>wampum</HI> to apprize the town of our coming,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the rules of <HI>Indian politeness,</HI> you must never go into a town with∣out sending a previous message to denote your arrival, or, standing at a distance from the town, and hallooing till some come out, to conduct you in. Otherwise you are thought as <HI>rude as white men.</HI></NOTE> with this message:</P>
<P>"Brother,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the people of a town, or of a nation, are addressed, the <HI>Indians</HI> always use the singular number.</NOTE> thy brethren are come a great way, and want to see thee, at thy fire, to <HI>smoak that good tobacco,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>I. E.</HI> To confer in a friendly manner.</NOTE> which our good grandfathers used to smoak. Turn thy eyes once more upon that road, by which I came.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>I.

I do not desire that my words may be hid, or spoken under cover. I want to speak loud, that all the <HI>Indians</HI> may hear me. I hope thou wilt bring me on the road, and lead me into the town. I blind the <HI>French,</HI> that they may not see me, and stop their ears, that they may not hear the great news I bring you."</P>
<P>About noon we met some <HI>Shawanese,</HI> that used to live at <HI>Wyo∣ming.</HI> They knew me, and received me very kindly. I saluted them, and assured them the government of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> wished them well, and wished to live in peace and friendship with them. Before we came to the town, two men came to meet us and lead
<PB N="70" REF="034421_0443_0FFDA1CF1AA9DDE0"/>
us in. King Beaver shewed us a large house to lodge in.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every <HI>Indian</HI> town has a large cabbin for the entertainment of strangers by the public hospitality.</NOTE> The peo∣ple soon came and shook hands with us. The number was about sixty young able men. Soon after king <HI>Beaver</HI> came and told his people, "Boys, hearken, we sat here without ever expecting again to see our brethren the <HI>English;</HI> but now one of them is brought before you, that you may see your brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> with your own eyes; and I wish you may take it into consideration." Afterwards he turned to me and said,</P>
<P>"Brother, I am very glad to see you, I never thought we should have had the opportunity to see one another more; but now I am very glad, and thank God, who has brought you to us. It is a great satisfaction to me." I said, "Brother, I rejoice in my heart, I thank God, who has brought me to you. I bring you joyful news from the Governor and people of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and from your children, the <HI>Friends:</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> and, as I have words of great consequence I will lay them before you, when all the kings and captains are called together from the other towns. I wish there may not be a man of them missing, but that they may be all here to hear."</P>
<P>In the evening king Beaver came again, and told me, they had held a council, and sent out to all their towns, but it would take five days before they could all come together. I thanked him for his care. Ten captains came and saluted me. One said to the others; "We never expected to see our brethren the <HI>English</HI> again, but now God has granted us once more to shake hands with them, which we will not forget." They sat by my fire till midnight.</P>
<P>—14th. The people crowded to my house; it was full. We had much talk. <HI>Delaware George</HI> said, he had not slept all night, so much had he been engaged on account of my coming. The <HI>French</HI> came, and would speak with me. There were then fifteen of them building houses for the <HI>Indians.</HI> The captain is gone with fifteen to another town. He can speak the <HI>Indian</HI> tongue well. The <HI>Indians</HI> say he is a cunning fox; that they get a great deal of goods from the <HI>French;</HI> and that the French cloath the <HI>Indians</HI> every year, men, women and children, and give them as much powder and lead as they want.</P>
<P>—15th. <HI>Beaver</HI> king was informed, that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had said he had turned the hatchet against the <HI>French,</HI> by advice of the <HI>Allegany Indians;</HI> this he blamed, as they had never sent him such advice. But being informed it was his own doing, without any persuasion of the Governor, he was easy on that head. <HI>De∣laware
<PB N="71" REF="034421_0444_0FFDA1D280885E28"/>
Daniel</HI> prepared a dinner, to which he invited me, and all the kings and captains; and when I came, he said, "Brother, we are as glad to see you among us, as if we dined with the Go∣vernor and people in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> We have thought a great deal since you have been here. We never thought so much before."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, we look on your coming as a matter of importance, it engages our at∣tention.</NOTE> I thanked them for their kind reception; I said, it was something great, that God had spared our lives, to see one another again, in the old brother-like love and friendship. There were in all thirteen, who dined together.</P>
<P>In the evening they danced at my fire, first the men, and then the women, till after midnight.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the king and the captains called on me privately. They wanted to hear what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had said of them, and beg∣ged me to take out the writings. I read to them what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had said, and told them, as <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had said he would speak so loud, that all at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and beyond, should hear it, I would conceal nothing from them. They said, they never sent any such advice (as above mentioned) to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> nor ever sent a mes∣sage at all to the government; and now the <HI>French</HI> were here, their captain would come to hear, and this would make disturbance. I then told them I would read the rest, and leave out that part, and they might tell the kings and captains of it, when they came together.</P>
<P>— 17th. Early this morning they called all the people toge∣ther to clean the place, where they intended to hold the council, it being in the middle of the town. <HI>Kushkushkee</HI> is divided into four towns, each at a distance from the others; and the whole consists of about ninety houses, and two hundred able warriors.</P>
<P>About noon two public messengers arrived from the <HI>Indians</HI> at fort <HI>Duquesne</HI> and the other towns. They brought three large belts and two bundles of strings;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These belts and strings are made of shell-beads, called <HI>wampum.</HI> The <HI>wampum</HI> serves, among the <HI>Indians,</HI> as money; of it they also make their necklaces, bracelets, and other ornaments. Belts and strings of it are used in all public negotiations; to each belt or string there is connected a message, speech, or part of a speech, to be delivered with a belt by the messenger, or speaker These belts also serve for records, being worked with figures, composed of beads of different colours, to assist the me∣mory.</NOTE> there came with them a <HI>French</HI> captain, and fifteen men. The two messengers insisted that I should go with them to fort <HI>Duquesne;</HI> that there were <HI>Indians</HI> of eight nations, who wanted to hear me; that if I brought good news, they inclined to leave off war, and live in friendship with the <HI>En∣glish.</HI> The above messengers being <HI>Indian</HI> captains, were very
<PB N="72" REF="034421_0445_0FFDA213C62DCD68"/>
surly. When I went to shake hands with one of them, he gave me his little finger; the other withdrew his hand entirely; upon which I appeared as stout as either, and withdrew my hand as quick as I could. Their rudeness to me was taken very ill by the other cap∣tains, who treated them in the same manner in their turn.</P>
<P>I told them my order was to go to the <HI>Indian</HI> towns, kings and captains, and not to the <HI>French;</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> were at was with the French, but not with those <HI>Indians,</HI> who withdrew from the <HI>French,</HI> and would be at peace with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>King Beaver invited me to his house to dinner, and afterwards he invited the <HI>French</HI> captain, and said before the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that the <HI>Indians</HI> were very proud to see one of their brothers, the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> among them; at which the <HI>French</HI> captain appeared low spi∣rited, and seemed to eat his dinner with very little appetite.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Indian</HI> kings and captains called me aside, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them the writings that I had. First I read part of the <HI>Easton</HI> treaty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them; but they presently stopped me, and would not hear it; I then began with the articles of peace made with the <HI>Indians</HI> there. They stopped me again, and said, they had nothing to say to any treaty, or league, of peace, made at <HI>Easton,</HI> nor had any thing to do with <HI>Teedyuscung;</HI> that, if I had nothing to say to them from the government, or Governor, they would have nothing to say to me; and farther said, they had hitherto been at war with the <HI>English,</HI> and had never expected to be at peace with them again; and that there were six of their men now gone to war against them with other <HI>Indians;</HI> that had there been peace between us, those men should not have gone to war. I then shewed them the belts and strings from the Governor; and they again told me to lay aside <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the peace made by him; for that they had nothing to do with it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The peace made with <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> was for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &amp;c. on <HI>Susquahanna</HI> only, and did not include the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Ohio;</HI> they having no deputies at the treaty. But he had promised to <HI>halloo</HI> to them, that is, send messengers to them, and endeavour to draw them into the peace, which he accordingly did.</NOTE> I desired them to suffer me to produce my papers, and I would read what I had to say to them.</P>
<P>—18th. <HI>Delaware George</HI> is very active in endeavouring to esta∣blish a peace. I believe he is in earnest. Hitherto they have all treated me kindly.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, all the kings and captains were called together, and sent for me to their council. King Beaver first add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed him∣self to the captains; and afterwards spoke to me, as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="034421_0446_0FFD7A10F1D0A7B0"/>"Brother, you have been here now five days by our fire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fire, in public affairs, signifies, among the <HI>Indians,</HI> a council.</NOTE> We have sent to all the kings and captains, desiring them to come to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re and hear the good news you brought. Yesterday they sent two captains to acquaint us, they were glad to hear our <HI>English</HI> bro∣ther was come among us, and were desirous to hear the good news he brought; and since there are a great many nations that went to see ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brother, they have invited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their fire, that they may hear us all. Now, brother, we have but one great fire; so, brother, by this string we will take you in our arms, and de∣liver you into the arms of the other kings, and when we have called all the nations there, we will hear the good news, you have brought." Delivers four strings.</P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver, Shingas,</HI> and <HI>Delaware George,</HI> spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"Brother, we alone cannot make a peace; it would be of no signification; for, as all the <HI>Indians,</HI> from the sun-rise to the sun∣set, are united in a body, it is necessary that the whole should join in the peace, or it can be no peace; and we can assure you, all the <HI>Indians,</HI> a great way from this, even beyond the lakes, are desirous of, and wish for a peace with the <HI>English,</HI> and have desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as we are the nearest of kin, if we see the <HI>English</HI> incline to a peace, to hold it fast."</P>
<P>On the 19th, all the people gathered together, men, women, and children; and king <HI>Beaver</HI> desired me to read to them the news I had brought, and told me that all the able men would go with me to the other town. I complied with his desire, and they ap∣peared very much pleased at every thing, till I came to that part respecting the prisoners. This they disliked; for, they say, it appears very odd and unreasonable that we should demand prison∣ers before there is an established peace; such an unreasonable de∣mand makes us appear as if we wanted brains.</P>
<P>—20th. We set out from <HI>Kushkushkee,</HI> for <HI>Sankonk;</HI> my com∣pany consisted of twenty-five horsemen and fifteen foot. We ar∣rived at <HI>Sankonk,</HI> in the afternoon. The people of the town were much disturbed at my coming, and received me in a very rough manner. They surrounded me with drawn knives in their hands, in such a manner, that I could hardly get along; running up against me; with their breasts open, as if they wanted some pre∣tence to kill me. I saw by their countenances they sought my death. Their faces were quite distorted with rage, and they went so far as to say, I should not live long; but some <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom I was formerly acquainted, coming up, and saluting me in a friendly manner, their behaviour to me was quickly changed.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="034421_0447_0FFDA1D922F1E088"/>On the 21st, they sent Messengers to Fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> to let them know I was there, and invited them to their fire. In the after∣noon, I read them all my message, the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sent; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still continued with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon which they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind to me. In the evening, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣kushkee.</HI> The men here now about one hundred and twenty.</P>
<P>—22d. Arrived about twenty <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Mingos.</HI> I read to them the message; at which they seemed well pleased. Then the two kings came to me, and spoke in the following manner:</P>
<P>"Brother, we, the <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Mingos,</HI> have heard your message; the messenger we sent to Fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> is returned, and tells us, there are eight different nations there, who want to hear your message; we will conduct you there, and let both the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> hear what our brothers, the English, have to say."</P>
<P>I protested against going to Fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> but all in vain; for they insisted on my going, and said that I need not fear the <HI>French,</HI> for they would carry me in their bosoms, i. e. engage for my safety.</P>
<P>—23d. We set off for Fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> and went no farther this night than Log's town, where I met with four <HI>Shawanese,</HI> who lived in <HI>Wyoming</HI> when I did. They received me very kindly, and called the prisoners to shake hands with me, as their country∣man, and gave me leave to go into every house to see them, which was done in no other town besides.</P>
<P>—24th. They called to me, and desired that I would write to the general for them. The jealousy natural to the <HI>Indians</HI> is not to be described; for though they wanted me to write for them, they were afraid I would, at the same time, give other information, and this perplexed them.</P>
<P>We continued our journey to the fort; and arrived in sight, on this side the river, in the afternoon, and all the <HI>Indian</HI> chiefs immediately came over; they called me into the middle, and king <HI>Beaver</HI> presented me to them, and said, "Here is our <HI>English</HI> brother, who has brought great news." Two of them rose up and signified they were glad to see me. But an old deaf <HI>Onondago Indian</HI> rose up and signified his displeasure. This <HI>Indian</HI> is much disliked by the others; he had heard nothing yet, that had passed, he has lived here a great while, and constantly lives in the fort, and is mightily attached to the <HI>French;</HI> he spoke as follows, to the <HI>De∣lawares;</HI></P>

<P>"That man speaks not as a man; he endeavours to frighten us, by saying this ground is his; he dreams; he and his father have certainly drank too much liquor; they are drunk; pray let them go to sleep till they be sober. You do not know what your own nation does, at home; how much they have to say to the <HI>Swannocks.</HI> You are quite rotten. You stink.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">That is, the sentiments you express, are offensive to the company.</NOTE> You do no∣thing but smoke your pipe here. Go to sleep with your father, and when you are sober we will speak to you."</P>
<P>After this the <HI>French</HI> demanded me of the <HI>Indians.</HI> They said it was a custom among the white people when a messenger came, even if it was the Governor, to blind his eyes, and lead him into the fort, to a prison, or private room. They, with some of the <HI>Indians</HI> insisted very much on my being sent into the fort, but to no purpose; for the other <HI>Indians</HI> said to the <HI>French:</HI> "It may be a rule among you, but we have brought him here, that all the <HI>Indians</HI> might see him, and hear what our brothers the English have to say; and we will not suffer him to be blinded and carried into the fort." The <HI>French</HI> still insisted on my being delivered to them; but the <HI>Indians</HI> desired them, to let them hear no more about it; but to send them one hundred loaves of bread; for they were hungry.</P>
<P>—25th. This morning early they sent us over a large bul∣lock, and all the <HI>Indian</HI> chiefs came over again, and counselled a great deal among themselves; then the <HI>Delaware,</HI> that handled the old deaf <HI>Onondago</HI> Indian so roughly yesterday, addressed him∣self to him, in this manner; "I hope, to day, you are sober. I
<PB N="76" REF="034421_0449_0FFDA1416C87C7C0"/>
am certain you did not know what you said yesterday. You en∣deavoured to frighten us; but know, <HI>we are now men,</HI> and not so easily frightened. You said something yesterday of the <HI>Shawanese;</HI> see here what they have sent you," <HI>(presenting him with a large roll of tobacco.)</HI></P>
<P>Then the old deaf <HI>Indian</HI> rose up, and acknowledged he had been in the wrong; he said, that he had now <HI>cleaned himself,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, he had changed his offensive sentiments.</NOTE> and hoped they would forgive him.</P>
<P>Then the Delaware delivered the message, that was sent by the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> which was, "That they hoped the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &amp;c. would be strong,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, that they would act vigorously.</NOTE> in what they were undertaking; that they were extremely proud to hear such good news from their brothers, the <HI>English;</HI> that whatever contracts they made with the <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>Shawanese</HI> would agree to; that they were their brothers, and that they loved them."</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> whispered to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as I imagined, to insist on my delivering what I had to say, on the other side of the water. Which they did to no purpose, for my company still insisted on a hearing on this side the water. The <HI>Indians</HI> crossed the river to council with their <HI>Fathers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">The <HI>French,</HI> at the fort.</NOTE> My company desired to know whe∣ther they would hear me or no. This afternoon three hundred <HI>Canadians</HI> arrived at the fort, and reported that six hundred more were soon to follow them, and forty battoes laden with amunition. Some of my party desired me not to stir from the fire; for that the <HI>French</HI> had offered a great reward for my scalp, and that there were several parties out on that purpose. Accordingly I stuck constantly as close to the fire, as if I had been chained there.</P>
<P>—26th. The <HI>Indians,</HI> with a great many of the French officers, came over to hear what I had to say. The officers brought with them a table, pens, ink and paper. I spoke in the middle of them with a free conscience, and perceived by the look of the <HI>French,</HI> they were not pleased with what I said; the particulars of which were as follows; I spoke in the name of the government and peo∣ple of <HI>Pensilvania.</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren at Allegheny, We have a long time desired to see and hear from you; you know the road was quite stopt; and we did not know how to come through. We have sent many messen∣gers to you; but we did not hear of you; now we are very glad

we have found an opening to come and see you, and to speak with you, and to hear your true mind and resolution. We salute you very heartily." A string, No. 1.</P>
<P>"Brethren at Allegheny, Take notice of what I say. You know that the bad spirit has brought something between us, that has kept us at a distance one from another; I now, by this belt, take every thing out of the way, that the bad spirit has brought between us, and all the jealousy and fearfulness we had of one another, and whatever else the bad spirit might have poisoned your heart and mind with, that nothing of it may be left. More∣over let us look up to God, and beg for his assistance, that he may put into our hearts what pleases him, and join us close in that bro∣therly love and friendship, which our grandfathers had. We assure you of our love towards you." A belt of eleven rows.</P>
<P>"Brothers at Allegheny, Hearken to what I say; we began to hear of you from <HI>Wellemeghihink,</HI> who returned from <HI>Allegheny.</HI> We heard you had but a slight confused account of us; and did not know of the peace, we made twelve months past, in <HI>Easton.</HI> It was then agreed, that the large belt of peace should be sent to you at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> As these our two old friends from <HI>Allegheny,</HI> who are well known to many here, found an opening to come to our council fire, to see with their own eyes, to sit with us face to face, to hear with their own ears, every thing that has been trans∣acted between us; it gives me and all the people of the province great pleasure to see them among us. And I assure all my brethren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that nothing would please me, and all the people of the province better, than to see our countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> well settled among us." A belt.</P>
<P>"Hearken, my brethren at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> When we began to make peace with the <HI>Delawares,</HI> twelve months ago, in behalf of ten other nations, we opened a road, and cleared the bushes from the blood, and gathered all the bones, on both sides, together; and when we had brought them together, in one heap, we could find no place to bury them: we would not bury them as our grandfa∣thers did. They buried them under ground, where they may be found again. We prayed to God, that he would have mercy on us, and take all these bones away from us, and hide them, that they might never be found any more; and take from both sides all the remem∣brance of them out of our heart and mind. And we have a firm confidence, that God will be pleased to take all the bones and hide them from us, that they may never be remembered by us, while we live, nor our children, nor grand children, hereafter. The hatchet was buried on both sides, and large belts of peace

Since we have cleared every thing from the heart, and taken every thing out of the way; now, my brethren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> every one that hears me, if you will jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with us, in that brotherly love and friendship, which our grand-fathers had, we assure you, that all past <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iences shall be forgotten, and never more talked of by us, our children and grand children hereafter. This belt as∣sures you of our sincerity, and honest and upright heart towards you." A belt of seven rows.</P>
<P>"Hearken, brethren at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> I have told you that we really made peace with part of your nation, twelve months past; I now by this belt open the road from <HI>Allegheny</HI> to our council fire, where your grandfathers kept good councils with us, that all may pass without molestation or danger. You must be sensible, that unless a road be kept open, people at variance can never to∣gether to make up their differences.

Now, bre∣thren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> I desire you will join with me in keeping the road open, and let us know in what manner we may come free to you, and what the token shall be. I join both my hands to yours, and will do all in my power to keep the road open." A belt of seven rows.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> Hear what I say. Every one that lays hold of this belt of peace, I proclaim peace to them from the <HI>English</HI> nation, and let you know that the great king of <HI>England</HI> does not incline to have war with the <HI>Indians;</HI> but he wants to live in peace and love with them, if they will lay down the hatchet, and loave off war against him."</P>
<P>"We love you farther, we let you know that the great king of <HI>England</HI> has sent a great number of warriors into this country, not to go to war against the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their towns, no, not at all; these warriors are going against the <HI>French;</HI> they are on the march to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> to revenge the blood they have shed. And by this belt I take you by the hand, and lead you at a distance from the <HI>French,</HI> for your own safety, that your legs may not be stained with blood. Come away on this side of the mountain, where we may oftener converse together, and where your own flesh and blood lives. We look upon you as our countrymen, that sprung out of the same ground with us; we think, therefore, that it is our duty to take care of you, and we in brotherly love advise you to come away with your whole nation, and as many of your friends as you can get to follow you. We do not come to hurt you, we love you, therefore we do not call you to war, that you may be slain; what be∣nefit will it be to you to go to war with your own flesh and blood?

We wish you may live without fear or danger with your women and children." The large peace bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>"Brethren, I have almost finished what I had to say, and hope it will be to your satisfaction; my wish is, that we may join close together in that old broth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> love and friendship, which our grandfathers had; so that all the nations may hear and see us, and have the benefit of it; and if you have any uneasiness, or com∣plaint, in your heart and mind, do not keep it to yourself. We have opened the road to the council fire, therefore, my brethren, come and acquaint the Governor with it; you will be readily heard, and full justice will be done you." A belt.</P>
<P>"Brethren, One thing I must bring to your remembrance. You know, if any body loses a little child, or some body takes it from him, he cannot be easy, he will think on his child by day and night; since our flesh and blood is in captivity, in the <HI>Indian</HI> towns, we desire you will rejoice the country's heart, and bring them to me; I shall stretch out my arms to receive you kindly." A string.</P>
<P>After I had done, I left my belts and strings still before them. The <HI>Delawares</HI> took them all up, and laid them before the <HI>Min∣goes;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Six Nations.</NOTE> upon which they rose up, and spoke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>"Chau,</HI> What I have heard pleases me well; I do not know why I go to war against the <HI>English. Noques,</HI> what do you think? You must be strong. I did not begin the war, therefore, I have little to say; but whatever you agree to, I will do the same." Then he addressed himself to the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and said, "You brought the hatchet to us from the <HI>French,</HI> and persuaded us to strike our brothers the <HI>English;</HI> you may consider (laying the belts, &amp;c. before them) wherefore you have done this."</P>
<P>The <HI>Shawanese</HI> acknowledged they received the hatchet from the <HI>French,</HI> who persuaded them to strike the <HI>English;</HI> that they would now send the belts to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and in twelve days would meet again.</P>
<P>Present at this council, three hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> They all took leave, and went over again to the fort, but my com∣panions, who were about seventy in number.</P>
<P><HI>Shamokin Daniel,</HI> who came with me, went over to the fort by himself, (which my companions disapproved of) and counselled with the Governor; who presented him with a laced coat and hat, a blanket, shirts, ribbons, a new gun, powder, lead, &amp;c. When he returned he was quite changed, and said, "See here, you
<PB N="80" REF="034421_0453_0FFDA168AAE15F08"/>
fools, what the <HI>French</HI> have given me. I was in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and never received a farthing;" and, directing himself to me, he said, "The English are fools, and so are you." In short, he behaved in a very proud, saucy and imperious manner. He further said, "The <HI>English</HI> never give the <HI>Indians</HI> any powder, and that the <HI>French</HI> would have given him a horseload, if he would have taken it; see that young man there, he was in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and never got on thing; I will take him over to the <HI>French,</HI> and get some cloathing for him."</P>
<P>Three <HI>Indians</HI> informed me, that as soon as the <HI>French</HI> got over, they called a council, with their own <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom there happened accidentally to be a <HI>Delaware</HI> captain, who was privately invited by one of his acquaintance to hear what the French had to say; and when they were assembled, the <HI>French</HI> spoke, as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>"My children, now we are alone, hearken to what I have to say. I perceive the <HI>Delawares</HI> are wavering; they incline to the <HI>English,</HI> and will be faithful to us no longer. Now all their chiefs are here, and but a handful, let us cut them off, and then we shall be troubled with them no longer." Then the <HI>Tawaas</HI> an∣swered, "No, we cannot do this thing; for though there is but a handful here, the <HI>Delawares</HI> are a strong people, and are spread to a great distance, and whatever they agree to must be."</P>
<P>This afternoon, in council, on the other side of the river, the <HI>French</HI> insisted that I must be delivered up to them, and that it was not lawful for me to go away; which occasioned a quarrel be∣tween them and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who immediately came away and crossed the river to me; and some of them let me know that <HI>Da∣niel</HI> had received a string from the <HI>French,</HI> to leave me there; but it was to no purpose, for they would not give their consent; and then agreed that I should set off before day the next morning.</P>
<P>—27th. Accordingly I set out before day, with six <HI>Indians,</HI> and took another road, that we might not be seen; the main body told me, they would stay behind, to know whether the <HI>French</HI> would make an attempt to take me by force; that if they did, they, the <HI>Indians,</HI> would endeavour to prevent their crossing the river, and coming secretly upon me. Just as I set off the <HI>French</HI> fired all their great guns, it being Sunday (I counted nineteen) and concluded they did the same every Sabbath. We passed through three <HI>Shawanese</HI> towns; the <HI>Indians</HI> appeared very proud to see me return, and we arrived about night at <HI>Sawcunk,</HI> where they were likewise very glad to see me return. Here I met with the two captains, who treated me so uncivilly before; they now

received me very kindly, and accepted of my hand, and apolo∣gized for their former rude behaviour. Their names are <HI>Kuckque∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> and <HI>Killbuck.</HI> They said.</P>
<P>"Brother, we, in behalf of the people of <HI>Sawcunk,</HI> desire that you will hold fast what you have begun, and be strong.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, go on steadily with this good work of establishing a peace.</NOTE> We are but little and poor, and therefore cannot do much. You are rich, and must go ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and be strong. We have done all in our power towards bringing about a peace: we have had a great quar∣rel about you with the <HI>French;</HI> but we do not mind them. Do you make haste, and be strong, and let us see you again." The said <HI>Killbuck</HI> is a great captain and conjurer; he desired me to men∣tion him to the Governor, and ask him if he would be pleased to send him a good saddle by the next messenger; and that he would do all in his power for the service of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>—28th. We set out from <HI>Sawcunk,</HI> in company with twenty, for <HI>Kushkushkee;</HI> on the road <HI>Shingas</HI> addressed himself to me, and asked, if I did not think, that, if he came to the <HI>English,</HI> they would hang him, as they had offered a great reward for his head. He spoke in a very soft and easy manner. I told him that was a great while ago, it was all forgotten and wiped clean away; that the English would receive him very kindly. Then <HI>Daniel</HI> inter∣rupted me, and said to <HI>Shingas,</HI> "Do not believe him, he tells nothing but idle lying stories. Wherefore did the <HI>English</HI> hire one thousand two hundred <HI>Indians</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Meaning the <HI>Cherokees.</HI></NOTE> to kill us." I protested it was false; he said, G—d d—n<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some of the first <HI>English</HI> speech, that the <HI>Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> learn from the traders, if swearing.</NOTE> you for a fool; did you not see the wo∣man lying in the road that was killed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that the <HI>En∣glish</HI> hired? I said, "Brother do consider how many thousand <HI>Indians</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have hired to kill the <HI>English,</HI> and how many they have killed along the frontiers." Then <HI>Daniel</HI> said, "D—n you, why do not you and the <HI>French</HI> sight on the sea? You come here only to cheat the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and take their land from them." Then <HI>Shingas</HI> told him to be still; for he did not know what he said. We arrived at <HI>Kushkushkee</HI> before night, and I informed <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s behaviour, at which he appeared sorry.</P>
<P>—29th. I dined with <HI>Shingas;</HI> he told me, though the <HI>En∣glish</HI> had set a great price on his head, he had never thought to revenge himself, but was always very kind to any prisoners that were brought in; and that he assured the Governor, he would do all in his power to bring about an established peace, and wished he could be certain of the <HI>English</HI> being in earnest.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="034421_0455_0FFDA1A6FAF27440"/>Then seven chiefs present said, when the Governor sends the next messenger, let him send two or three white men, at least, to confirm the thing, and not send such a man as <HI>Daniel;</HI> they did not understand him; he always speaks, said they, as if he was drunk; and if a great many of them had not known me, they should not know what to think; for every thing I said he contradicted. I assured them I would faithfully inform the Governor of what they said, and they should see, as messengers, other guise <HI>Indians</HI> than <HI>Daniel,</HI> for the time to come; and I farther informed them, that he was not sent by the Governor, but came on his own accord; and I would endeavour to prevent his coming again. <HI>Daniel</HI> de∣manded of me his pay, and I gave him three dollars; and he took as much wampum from me as he pleased, and would not suffer me to count it. I imagined there was about two thousand.</P>
<P>About night, nine <HI>Tawaas</HI> past by here, in their way to the <HI>French</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>—30th and 31st. The <HI>Indians</HI> feasted greatly, during which time, I several times begged of them to consider and dispatch me.</P>
<P>September 1st. <HI>Shingas,</HI> King <HI>Beaver, Delaware George,</HI> and <HI>Pisquetumen,</HI> with several other captains said to me,</P>
<P>"Brother, We have thought a great deal since God has brought you to us; and this is a matter of great consequence, which we cannot readily answer; we think on it, and will answer you as soon as we can. Our feast hinders us; all our young men, wo∣men and children are glad to see you; before you came, they all agreed together to go and join the <HI>French;</HI> but since they have seen you, they all draw back; though we have great reason to be∣lieve you intend to drive us away, and settle the country; or else, why do you come to fight in the land that God has given us?"</P>
<P>I said, we did not intend to take the land from them; but only to drive the <HI>French</HI> away. They said, they knew better; for that they were informed so by our greatest traders; and some Justices of the Peace had told them the same, and the <HI>French,</HI> said they, tell us much the same thing,—"that the <HI>English</HI> intend to destroy us, and take our lands from us; but, that they are only come to defend us and our lands;" but the land is ours, and not theirs; therefore, we say, if you will be at peace with us, we will send the <HI>French</HI> home. It is you that have begun the war, and it is ne∣cessary that you hold fast, and be not discouraged, in the work of peace. We love you more than you love us; for when we take any prisoners from you, we treat them as our own children. We are poor, and yet we clothe them as well as we can, though you see our children are as naked as at the first. By this you may see
<PB N="83" REF="034421_0456_0FFDA17AD1A7A358"/>
that our hearts are better than yours. It is plain that you white people are the cause of this war; why do not you and the <HI>French</HI> fight in the old country, and on the sea? Why do you come to fight on our land? This makes every body believe, you want to take the land from us by force, and settle it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indians, having plenty of land, are no niggards of it. They sometimes give large tracts to their friends freely; and when they sell it, they make most ge∣nerous bargains But some <HI>fraudulent purchases,</HI> in which they were grossly imposed on, and some <HI>violent intrusions,</HI> imprudently and wickedly made without purchase, have rendered them jealous that we intend finally to take all from them by force. We should endeavour to recover our credit with them by fair purchases and honest payments; and then there is no doubt but they will readily sell us, at reasonable rates, as much, from time to time, as we can possibly have occasion for.</NOTE></P>
<P>I told them, "Brothers, as for my part, I have not one foot of land, nor do I desire to have any; and if I had any land, I had ra∣ther give it to you, than take any from you. Yes, brothers, if I die, you will get a little more land from me; for I shall then no longer walk on that ground, which God has made. We told you that you should keep nothing in your heart, but bring it before the council fire, and before the Governor, and his council; they will readily hear you; and I promise you, what they answer they will stand to. I further read to you what agreements they made about <HI>Wioming,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The agreement made with <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that he should enjoy the <HI>Wioming</HI> lands, and have houses built there for him and his people.</NOTE> and they stand to them."</P>
<P>They said, "Brother, your heart is good, you speak always sin∣cerely; but we know there are always a great number of people that want to get rich; they never have enough: look, we do not want to be rich, and take away that which others have. God has given you the tame creatures; we do not want to take them from you, God has given to us the deer, and other wild creatures, which we must feed on; and we rejoice in that which springs out of the ground, and thank God for it. Look now, my brother, the white people think we have no brains in our heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes them make war with us: we are but a little handful to what you are; but remember, when you look for a wild turkey you cannot always find it, it is so little it hides itself under the bushes: and when you hunt for a rattle∣snake, you cannot find it; and perhaps it will bite you before you see it. However, since you are so great and big, and we so little, do you use your greatness and strength in compleating this work of peace. This is the first time that we saw or heard of you, since the war begun, and we have great reason to think about it, since
<PB N="84" REF="034421_0457_0FFDA1A98C3D0A98"/>
such a great body of you comes into our lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The army under <HI>General Forbes.</HI></NOTE>. It is told us, that you and the <HI>French</HI> contrived the war, to waste the <HI>Indians</HI> between you; and that you and the <HI>French</HI> intended to divide the land be∣tween you: this was told us by the chief of the <HI>Indian</HI> traders; and they said further, brothers, this is the last time we shall come among you; for the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> intend to kill all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then divide the land among themselves.</P>
<P>Then they addressed themselves to me, and said, "Brother, I suppose you know something about it; or has the Governor stopped your mouth, that you cannot tell us?"</P>
<P>Then I said, "Brothers, I am very sorry to see you so jealous. I am your own flesh and blood, and sooner than I would tell you any story that would be of hurt to you, or your children, I would suffer death: and if I did not know that it was the desire of the Governor, that we should renew our old brotherly love and friend∣ship, that subsisted between our grandfathers, I would not have undertaken this journey. I do assure you of mine and the people's honesty. If the <HI>French</HI> had not been here, the <HI>English</HI> would not have come; and consider, brothers, whether, in such a case, we can always sit still."</P>
<P>Then they said, "It is a thousand pities we did not know this sooner; if we had, it would have been peace long before now."</P>
<P>Then I said, "My brothers, I know you have been wrongly persuaded by many wicked people; for you must know, that there are a great many Papists in the country, in <HI>French</HI> interest, who appear like gentlemen, and have sent many runaway <HI>Irish</HI> papist ser∣vants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Indian</HI> land is used to buy the transported <HI>Irish,</HI> and other convicts, as ser∣vants, to be employed in carrying up the goods among the <HI>Indians:</HI> many of those ran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way from their masters▪ and joined the <HI>Indians.</HI> The ill behaviour of these peo∣ple has always hurt the character o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>English</HI> among the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> among you, who have put bad notions into your heads, and strengthened you against your brothers the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>"Brothers, I beg that you would not believe every idle and false story, that ill-designing people may bring to you against us your brothers. Let us not hearken to what lying and foolish people may bring to you, against us your brothers. Let us not hearken to what lying and foolish people say, but let us hear what wise and good people say; they will tell us what is good for us and our children."</P>
<P>Mem. There are a great number of <HI>Irish</HI> traders now among the <HI>Indians,</HI> who have always endeavoured to spirit up the <HI>Indians</HI> against the <HI>English;</HI> which made some, that I was acquainted with from their infancy, desire the chiefs to enquire of me, for that they were certain I would speak the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="034421_0458_0FFDA1AC18A19E48"/><HI>Pisquetumen</HI> now told me, we could not go to the General, that it was very dangerous, the <HI>French</HI> having sent out several scouts to wait for me on the road. And further, <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> told me, it was a pity the Governor had no ear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No spy among his enemies.</NOTE>, to bring him intelligence; that the <HI>French</HI> had three ears, whom they rewarded with great presents; and signified, that he and <HI>Shingas</HI> would be ears, at the service of his honour, if he pleased.</P>
<P>—2d. I bade <HI>Shingas</HI> to make haste and dispatch me, and once more desired to know of them, if it was possible for them to guide me to the General. Of all which they told me they would consi∣der; and <HI>Shingas</HI> gave me his hand, and said, "Brother, the next time you come, I will return with you to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and will do all in my power to prevent any body's coming to hurt the <HI>English</HI> more."</P>
<P>—3d. To-day I found myself unwell, and made a little tea, which refreshed me: had many very pretty discourses with <HI>George.</HI> In the afternoon they called a council together, and gave me the following answer in council; the speaker addressing the Governor and people of <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, It is a great many days since we have seen and heard you.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That is, since we had a friendly intercourse with each other. The frequent re∣petition of the word, <HI>Brethren,</HI> is the effect of their rules of politeness, which enjoin, in all conversations, a constant remembrance of the relation subsisting between the parties, especially where that relation implies any affection, or respect. It is like the perpetual repetitions among us, of <HI>Sir,</HI> or, <HI>Madam,</HI> or, <HI>Your Lordship.</HI> In the same manner the <HI>Indians</HI> at every sentence repeat, <HI>My Father, My Uncle, My Cousin, My Brother, My Friend,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> I now speak to you in behalf of all the nations, that have heard you heretofore.</P>
<P>"Brethren, it is the first message which we have seen or heard from you. Brethren, you have talked of that peace and friend∣ship which we had formerly with you. Brethren, we tell you to be strong, and always remember that friendship, which we had formerly. Brethren, we desire you would be strong, and let us once more hear of our good friendship and peace, we had former∣ly. Brethren, we desire that you make haste, and let us hear of you again; for, as yet, we have not heard you rightly.</P>
<P>Gives a string.</P>
<P>"Brethren, near what I have to say: look, brethren, we, who have now seen and heard you, we, who are present, are part of all the several nations, that heard you some days ago; we see that you are sorry we have not that friendship, we formerly had.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="034421_0459_0FFDA22EE4CD3808"/>"Look, brethren, we at <HI>Allegheny</HI> are likewise sorry, we have not that friendship with you, which we formerly had. Brethren, we long for that peace and friendship we had formerly. Brethren, it is good that you desire that friendship, that was formerly among our fathers and grandfathers. Brethren, we will tell you, you must not let that friendship be quite lost, which was formerly between us.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren, it is three years since we dropt that peace and friendship, which we formerly had with you. Brethren, it was dropt, and lay buried in the ground, where you and I stand, in the middle between us both. Brethren, I see you have digged up, and revived, that friendship, which was buried in the ground; and now you have it, hold it fast. Do be strong, bre∣thren, and exert yourselves, that that friendship may be well esta∣blished and finished between us. Brethren, if you will be strong, it is in your power to finish that peace and friendship well. There∣fore, brethren, we desire you to be strong and establish it, and make known to all the <HI>English</HI> this peace and friendship, that it may embrace all and cover all. As you are of one nation and co∣lour, in all the <HI>English</HI> governments, so let the peace be the same with all. Brethren, when you have finished this peace, which you have begun; when it is known every where amongst your brethren, and you have every where agreed together on this peace and friendship, then you will be pleased to send the great peace belt to us at <HI>Allegheny.</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, when you have settled this peace and friendship, and finished it well, and you send the great peace-belt to me, I will send it to all the nations of my colour, they will all join to it, and we all will hold it fast.</P>
<P>"Brethren, when all the nations join to this friendship, then the day will begin to shine clear over us. When we hear once more of you, and we join together, then the day will be still, and no wind, or storm, will come over us, to disturb us.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren, you know our hearts, and what we have to say; be strong; if you do what we have now told you, and in this peace all the nations agree to join. Now, brethren, let the king of <HI>England</HI> know what our mind is as soon as possibly you can."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this speech the <HI>Indians</HI> carefully guard the honour of their nation, by fre∣quently intimating, that the peace is <HI>sought by the English: you have talked of peace: you are sorry for the war: you have digged up the peace, that was buried,</HI> &amp;c. Then they declare their readiness to grant peace, if the <HI>English</HI> agree to its being general, for all the colonies. The <HI>Indian</HI> word, that is translated, <HI>be strong,</HI> so often repeated, is an expression they use to spirit up persons, who have undertaken some difficult task, as to lift, or move, a great weight, or execute a difficult enterprize; nearly equivalent to our word, <HI>courage! courage!</HI></NOTE> Gives a belt of eight rows.</P>

<P>—4th. Present, <HI>Shingas,</HI> King <HI>Beaver, Pisquetumen,</HI> and se∣veral others. I asked what they meant by saying, <HI>"They had not rightly heard me yet."</HI> They said,</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="034421_0461_0FFDA144E674AA60"/>"Brother, you very well know that you have collected all your young men about the country, which makes a large body;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning General Forbes's army.</NOTE> and now they are standing <HI>before our doors;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>I, E.</HI> Just ready to enter our country.</NOTE> you come with good news, and fine speeches. Brother, this is what makes us jealous, and we do not know what to think of it: if you had brought the news of peace before your army had begun to march, it would have caused a great deal more good. We do not so readily be∣lieve you, because a great many great men and traders have told us, long before the war, that you and the <HI>French</HI> intended to join and cut all the <HI>Indians</HI> off. These were people of your own colour, and your own countrymen; and some told us to join the <HI>French;</HI> for that they would be our fathers: besides, many runaways have told us the same story; and some we took prisoners told us how you would use us, if you caught us: therefore, brother, I say, we cannot conclude, at this time, but must see and hear you once more." And further they said,</P>
<P>"Now, brother, you are here with us, you are our flesh and blood, speak from the bottom of your heart, will not the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> join together to cut off the <HI>Indians?</HI> Speak, brother, from your heart, and tell us the truth, and let us know who were the beginners of the war."</P>
<P>Then I delivered myself thus:</P>
<P>"Brothers, I love you from the bottom of my heart. I am extremely sorry to see the jealousy so deeply rooted in your hearts and minds. I have told you the truth; and yet, if I was to tell it you a hundred times, it seems you would not rightly believe me. My <HI>Indian</HI> brothers, I wish you would draw your hearts to God, that he may convince you of the truth.</P>
<P>"I do now declare, before God, that the <HI>English</HI> never did, nor never will, join with the <HI>French</HI> to destroy you. As far as I know, the <HI>French</HI> are the beginners of this war. Brothers, about twelve years ago, you may remember, they had war with the English, and they both agreed to articles of peace. The <HI>English</HI> gave up <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Breton</HI> in <HI>Acadia,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> never gave up the part of that country, which they had agreed to give up; and, in a very little time, made their <HI>Children</HI> strike the <HI>English.</HI> This was the first cause of the war. Now, brothers; if any body strike you three times, one after another, you still sit still and consider: they strike you again, then, my brothers, you say, it is time, and you will rise up to defend yourselves. Now, my brothers, this is exactly the case between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> Consider farther,
<PB N="89" REF="034421_0462_0FFDA146E4A024F8"/>
my brothers, what a great number of our poor back inhabitants have been killed since the <HI>French</HI> came to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The French are the cause of their death, and if they were not there, the <HI>English</HI> would not trouble themselves to go there. They go no where to war, but where the French are. Those wicked people that set you at variance with the <HI>English,</HI> by telling you many wicked sto∣ries, are papists in French pay: besides, there are many among us, in the <HI>French</HI> service, who appear like gentlemen, and buy Irish papist servants, and promise them great rewards to run away to you and strengthen you against the <HI>English,</HI> by making them appear as black as devils."</P>
<P>This day arrived here two hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> on their way to <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI> They staid all night. In the middle of the night king <HI>Beaver</HI>'s daughter died, on which a great many guns were fired in the town.</P>
<P>—5th. It made a general stop in my journey. The <HI>French</HI> said to their Children, they should catch me privately, or get my scalp. The commander wanted to examine me, as he was going to <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI> When they told me of it, I said, as he was going to <HI>fort Duquesne,</HI> he might enquire about me there: I had nothing at all to say, or do with the <HI>French:</HI> they would tell them every particular they wanted to know in the fort. They all came into the house where I was, as if they would see a new creature.</P>
<P>In the afternoon there came six <HI>Indians,</HI> and brought three Ger∣man prisoners, and two scalps of the <HI>Catabaws.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Daniel</HI> blamed the <HI>English,</HI> that they never paid him for his trouble, I asked him whether he was pleased with what I paid him. He said, no. I said, "Brother, you took as much as you pleased." I asked you, whether you was satisfied; you said, yes. I told him, I was ashamed to hear him blame the country so. I bid him, "You shall have for this journey whatever you desire, when I reach the inhabitants."</P>
<P>—6th. <HI>Pisquetumen, Tom Hickman</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> told me,</P>
<P>"Brother, it is good that you have stayed so long with us; we love to see you, and wish to see you here longer; but since you are so desirous to go, you may set off to morrow: <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> has brought you here, and he may carry you home again: you have seen us, and we have talked a great deal together, which we have not done for a long time before. Now, Brother, we love you, but cannot help wondering why the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> do not make up with one another, and tell one another not to fight on our land."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="034421_0463_0FFDA22BB1BF2738"/>I told them, "Brother, if the <HI>English</HI> told the <HI>French</HI> so a thou∣sand times, they never would go away. Brother, you know so long as the world has stood there has not been such a war. You know when the French lived on the other side, the war was there, and here we lived in peace. Consider how many thousand men are killed, and how many houses are burned since the <HI>French</HI> lived here; if they had not been here it would not have been so; you know we do not blame you; we blame the <HI>French;</HI> they are the cause of this war; therefore, we do not come to hurt you, but to chastise the <HI>French."</HI></P>
<P>They told me, that at the great council, held at <HI>Onondago,</HI> among the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> before the war began (<HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> was there, and wrote every thing down) it was said to the <HI>Indians</HI> at the <HI>Ohio,</HI> that they should let the <HI>French</HI> alone there, and leave it entirely to the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> the <HI>Five Nations</HI> would know what to do with them. Yet soon after two hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came and built <HI>Fort Duquesne.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> spoke to <HI>Pisquetumen,</HI></P>
<P>"Brother, you told us that the Governor of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> took this man out of their bosoms, and put him into your bosom, that you should bring him here; and you have brought him here to us; and we have seen and heard him; and now we give him into your bosom, to bring him to the same place again, before the Governor; but do not let him quite loose; we shall rejoice when we shall see him here again." They desired me to speak to the Governor, in their behalf, as follows:</P>
<P>"Brother, we beg you to remember our oldest brother, <HI>Pisque∣tumen,</HI> and furnish him with good cloathes, and reward him well for his trouble; for we all shall look upon him when he comes back."</P>
<P>—7th. When we were ready to go, they began to council which course we should go, to be safest; and then they hunted for the horses, but could not find them; and so we lost that days journey.</P>
<P>It is a troublesome cross and heavy yoke to draw this people: They can punish and squeeze a body's heart to the utmost. I sus∣pect the reason they kept me here so long was by instigation of the <HI>French.</HI> I remember somebody told me, the <HI>French</HI> told them to keep me twelve days longer, for that they were afraid I should get back too soon, and give information to the general. My heart has been very heavy here, because they kept me for no purpose. The Lord knows how they have been counselling about my life; but they did not know who was my protector and deliverer: I believe
<PB N="91" REF="034421_0464_0FFDA1496DD10CB8"/>
my Lord has been too strong against them; my enemies have done what lies in their power.</P>
<P>—8th. We prepared for our journey on the morning, and made ourselves ready. There came some together and examined me what I had wrote yesterday. I told them, I wondered what need they had to concern themselves about my writing. They said, if they knew I had wrote about the prisoners, they would not let me go out of the town. I told them what I writ was my duty to do. "Brothers, I tell you, I am not afraid of you, if there were a thousand more. I have a good conscience before God and man. I tell you I have wrote nothing about the prisoners. I tell you, Brothers, this is not good; there's a bad spirit in your heart, which breeds that jealousy; and it will keep you ever in fear, that you will never get rest. I beg you would pray to God, for grace to resist that wicked spirit, that breeds such wicked jealousies in you; which is the reason you have kept me here so long. How often have I begged of you to dispatch me? I am ashamed to see you so jealous; I am not, in the least, afraid of you. Have I not brought writings to you? and what, do you think I must not carry some home, to the Governor? or, shall I shut my mouth, and say nothing? Look into your own hearts, and see if it would be right or wrong, if any body gives a salutation to their friends, and it is not returned in the same way. You told me many times how kind you were to the prisoners, and now you are afraid that any of them should speak to me."</P>
<P>They told me, they had cause to be afraid; and then made a draught, and shewed me how they were surrounded with war. Then I told them, if they would be quiet, and keep at a distance, they need not fear. Then they went away, very much ashamed, one after another. I told my men, that we must make haste and go; and accordingly we set off, in the afternoon, from <HI>Kushkush∣kee,</HI> and came ten miles.</P>
<P>—9th. We took a little foot-path hardly to be seen. We lost it, and went through thick bushes, till we came to a mire, which we did not see, till we were in it; and <HI>Tom Hickman</HI> fell in, and almost broke his leg. We had hard work before we could get the horse out again. The Lord helped me, that I got safe from my horse. I and <HI>Pisquetumen</HI> had enough to do to come through. We passed many such places: it rained all day; and we got a double portion of it, because we received all that hung on the bushes. We were as wet as if we were swimming all the day; and at night we laid ourselves down in a swampy place to sleep, where we had nothing but the heavens for our covering.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="034421_0465_0FFDA1F42790DC48"/>—10th. We had but little to live on. <HI>Tom Hickman</HI> shot a deer on the road. Every thing here, upon the <HI>Ohio,</HI> is extremely dear, much more so than in <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI> I gave for one dish of corn four hundred and sixty <HI>wampum.</HI> They told me that the Governor of <HI>fort Duquesne</HI> kept a store of his own, and that all the <HI>Indians</HI> must come and buy the goods of him; and when they come and buy, he tells them, if they will go to war, they shall have as much goods as they please. Before I set off, I heard fur∣ther, that a <HI>French</HI> captain who goes to all the <HI>Indian</HI> towns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was sent to collect the <HI>Indians</HI> together, to attack General Forbes's army, once more, on their march.</NOTE> came to <HI>Sacunck,</HI> and said, "Children, will you not come and help your father against the <HI>English?"</HI> They answered, "Why should we go to war against our brethren? They are now our friends." "O! Children," said he, "I hope you do not own them for friends." "Yes," said they, "We do; we are their friends, and we hope they will remain ours." "O! Children, said he, you must not believe what you have heard, and what has been told you by that man." They said to him, "Yes, we do believe him more than we do you: it was you that set us against them; and we will by and by have peace with them:" and then he spoke not a word more, but returned to the fort. So, I hope, some good is done: praised be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>—11th. Being Monday, we went over <HI>Antigoc:</HI> we went down a very steep hill, and our horses slipt so far, that I expected, every moment, they would fall heels over head. We found fresh <HI>Indian</HI> tracts on the other side of the river. We crossed <HI>Allegheny</HI> river, and went through the bushes upon a high hill, and slept upon the side of the mountain, without fire, for fear of the ene∣my. It was a cold night, and I had but a thin blanket to cover myself.</P>
<P>—12th. We made a little fire, to warm ourselves in the morning. Our horses began to be weary with climbing up and down these steep mountains. We came this night to the top of a mountain, where we found a log-house. Here we made a small fire, just to boil ourselves a little victuals. The <HI>Indians</HI> were very much afraid, and lay with their guns and tomhocks on all night. They heard somebody run and whisper in the night. I slept very sound, and in the morning they asked me, if I was not afraid the enemy <HI>Indians</HI> would kill me. I said, "No, I am not afraid of the <HI>Indians,</HI> nor the devil himself: I fear my great Creator, God." "Aye, they said, you know you will go to a good place when you die, but we do not know that: that makes us afraid."</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="034421_0466_0FFDA23396900428"/>—13th. In the afternoon we twice crossed <HI>Chowatin,</HI> and came to <HI>Ponchestanning,</HI> an old deserted <HI>Indian</HI> town, that lies on the same creek. We went through a bad swamp, where were very thick sharp thorns, so that they tore our cloaths and flesh, both hands and face, to a bad degree. We had this kind of road all the day. In the evening we made a fire, and then they heard something rush, in the bushes, as though they heard somebody walk. Then we went about three gun-shot from our fire, and could not find a place to lie down on, for the innumerable rocks; so that we were obliged to get small stones to fill up the hollow places in the rocks, for our bed; but it was very uneasy; almost shirt and skin grew together. They kept watch one after another all night.</P>
<P>—14th. In the morning, I asked them what made them afraid. They said, I knew nothing; the <HI>French</HI> had set a great price on my head; and they knew there was gone out a great scout to lie in wait for me. We went over great mountains and a very bad road.</P>
<P>—15th. We came to <HI>Susquehanna,</HI> and crossed it six times, and came to <HI>Catawaweshink,</HI> where had been an old <HI>Indian</HI> town. In the evening there came three <HI>Indians,</HI> and said they saw two <HI>Indian</HI> tracks, which came to the place where we slept, and turned back, as if to give information of us to a party; so that we were sure they followed us.</P>
<P>—16th and 17th. We crossed the mountain.</P>
<P>—18th. Came to the <HI>Big Island,</HI> where having nothing to live on, we were obliged to stay to hunt.</P>
<P>—19th. We met 20 warriors, who were returning from the inhabitants, with five prisoners and one scalp; six of them were <HI>Delawares,</HI> the rest <HI>Mingoes.</HI> We sat down all in one ring to∣gether. I informed them where I had been, and what was done; they asked me to go back a little, and so I did, and slept all night with them. I informed them of the particulars of the peace pro∣posed; they said, "If they had known so much before, they would not have gone to war. Be strong; if you make a good peace, then we will bring all the prisoners back again." They killed two deer, and gave me one.</P>
<P>—20th. We took leave of each other, and went on our journey, and arrived the 22d at <HI>fort Augusta,</HI> in the afternoon, very weary and hungry; but greatly rejoiced of our return from this tedious journey.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="034421_0467_0FFDA17D6087E568"/>There is not a prouder, or more high minded people, in them∣selves, than the Indians. They think themselves the wisest and prudentest men in the world; and that they can over-power both the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> when they please. The white people are, in their eyes, nothing at all. They say, that through their conjur∣ing craft they can do what they please, and nothing can withstand them. In their way of sighting they have this method, to see that they first shoot the officers and commanders; and then, they say, we shall be sure to have them. They also say, that if their conju∣rers run through the middle of our people, no bullet can hurt them. They say too, that when they have shot the commanders, the soldiers will all be confused, and will not know what to do. They say of themselves, that every one of them is like a king and captain, and fights for himself. By this way they imagine they can overthrow any body of men, that may come against them. They say, "The <HI>English</HI> people are fools; they hold their guns half man high, and then let them snap; we take sight and have them at a shot, and so do the <HI>French;</HI> they do not only shoot with a bullet, but big swan shot." They say, the French load with a bullet and six swan-shot. They further say, "We take care to have the first shot at our enemies, and then they are half dead before they begin to fight."</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are a people full of jealousy, and will not easily trust any body; and they are very easily affronted, and brought into jealousy; then afterwards they will have nothing at all to do with those they suspect; and it is not brought so easy out of their minds; they keep it to their graves, and leave the seed of it in their children and grand children's minds; so, if they can, they will revenge themselves for every imagined injury. They are a very distrustful people. Through their imagination and reason they think themselves a thousand times stronger than all all other peo∣ple. <HI>Fort du Quesne</HI> is said to be undermined. The <HI>French</HI> have given out, that, if we overpower them, and they should die, we should certainly all die with them. When I came to the fort, the garrison, it was said, consisted of about one thousand four hun∣dred men; and I am told they will now be full three thousand <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> They are almost all <HI>Canadians,</HI> and will cer∣tainly meet the general before he comes to the fort, in an ambush. You may depend upon it the <HI>French</HI> will make no open field-battle, as in the old country, but lie in ambush. The <HI>Canadians</HI> are all hunters. The <HI>Indians</HI> have agreed to draw back; but how far we may give credit to their promises the Lord knows. It is the best way to be on our guard against them, as if they really could with one thousand overpower eight thousand.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="034421_0468_0FFDA1C20A9BAAF0"/>Thirty-two nights I lay in the woods; the heavens were any covering. The dew came so hard sometimes, that it pinched close to the skin. There was nothing that laid so heavy on my heart, as the man that went along with me. He thwarted me in every thing I said or did; not that he did it against me, but against the country, on whose business I was sent; I was afraid he would overthrow what I went about. When he was with the <HI>English</HI> he would speak against the <HI>French,</HI> and when with the <HI>French</HI> against the <HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> observed that he was a false fellow, and desired me, that I would not bring him any more, to transact any business between the <HI>English</HI> and them; and told me, it was through his means I could not have the liberty to talk with the prisoners.</P>
<P>Praise and glory be to the <HI>Lamb,</HI> that has been slain, and brought me through the country of dreadful jealousy and mistrust, where the prince of this world has his rule and government over the children of disobedience.</P>
<P>The Lord has preserved me through all the dangers and difficul∣ties, that I have ever been under. He directed me according to his will, by his holy spirit. I had no one to converse with but him. He brought me under a thick, heavy, and dark cloud, into the open air; for which I adore, praise and worship the Lord my God, that I know has grasped me in his hands, and has forgiven me for all sins, and sent and washed my heart with his most precious blood; that I now live not for myself, but for him that made me; and to do his holy will is my pleasure. I own that, in the children of light, there dwells another kind of spirit, than there does in the children of this world; therefore, these two spirits cannot rightly agree in fellowship.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The second journal of <HI>Christian Frederick Post,</HI> on a message from the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> in the latter part of the same year:</P>
<P>Containing his further negotiation with these people, to accomplish the design of his former journey, and procure a peace with them; in which he met with fresh difficulties and dangers, occasioned by the <HI>French</HI> influence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Indians,</HI> being acquainted with his honest simplicity, and calling to mind their former friendship with the inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylva∣nia,</HI> so far paid a regard to his sincerity, as to listen to the terms proposed; and in consequence thereof the <HI>French</HI> were obliged to aban∣don the whole <HI>Ohio</HI> country to General <HI>Forbes,</HI> after destroying with their own hands their strong fort of <HI>Duquesne.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>October</HI> 25th, 1758. HAVING received the orders of the honourable Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> I set out from <HI>Easton</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and arrived there about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was em∣ployed most of the night, in preparing myself with necessaries, &amp;c. for the journey.</P>
<P>—26th. Rose early, but my horse being lame, though I tra∣velled all the day, I could not, till after night, reach to an inn, about ten miles from <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>—27th. I set out early, and about seven o'clock in the morn∣ing came to <HI>Reading,</HI> and there found Captain <HI>Bull,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> just mounted, and ready to set out on their journey; they were heartily glad to see me; <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> stretched out his arms, and said, "Now, Brother, I am glad I have got you in my arms, I will not let you go, I will not let your go again from me, you must go with me:" and I likewise said the same to him, and told him, "I will accompany you, if you will go the same way as I must go." And then I called them together, in Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI>'s house, and read a letter to them, which I had received from the Governor, which is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Brethen, Mr. <HI>Frederick Post</HI> is come express from the general, who sends his compliments to you, and desires you would come by the way of his camp, and give him an opportunity of talking with you.</P>
<P>By this string of wampum I request of you to alter your intended rout by way of <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and to go to the general, who will give you a kind reception. It is a nigher way, in which you will be better supplied with provisions, and can travel with less fa∣tigue and more safety.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To which I added, "Brethren, I take you by this string,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A string of <HI>wampum</HI> beads. Nothing of importance is said, or proposed without <HI>wampum.</HI></NOTE> by the hand, and lift you from this place, and lead you along to the general."</P>
<P>After which they consulted among themselves, and soon resolved to go with me. We shook hands with each other, and Mr. Hays immediately set out with them; after which, having with some difficulty procured a fresh horse, in the king's service, I set off about noon with captain <HI>Bull;</HI> and when we came to <HI>Conrad Wei∣ser's</HI> plantation, we found <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> lying on the ground very drunk,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Indians,</HI> having learned drunkenness of the white people, do not reckon it among the vices.

<P>—28th. We rose early, and I spoke to <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> a great deal; he was very sick, and could hardly stir; when we overtook the rest, we found them in the same condition; and they seemed dis∣couraged, from going the way to the general; and wanted to go through the woods. I told them, I was sorry to see them waver∣ing, and reminded them, that when I went to their towns, I was not sent to the <HI>French,</HI> but when your old men insisted on my go∣ing to them, I followed their advice, and went; and as the gene∣ral is, in the king's name, over the provinces, in matters of war

They then resolved to go to <HI>Harris's</HI> fer∣ry, and consider about it as they went;—we arrived there late in the night.</P>
<P>—29th. In the morning, the two <HI>Cayugas</HI> being most desir∣ous of going through the woods, the others continued irresolute<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They were afraid of going where our people were all in arms, lest some of the indiscreet soldiers might kill them.</NOTE>; upon which I told them, "I wish you would go with good cou∣rage, and with hearty resolution," and repeated what I had said to them yesterday, and reminded them, as they were messengers, they should consider what would be the best for their whole nation; "consult among yourselves, and let me know your true mind and determination;" and I informed them, I could not go with them, unless they would go to the general, as I had messages to deliver him. After which, having consulted together, <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> came and gave me his hand, and said, "Brother, here is my hand, we have all joined to go with you, and we put ourselves under your protection to bring us safe through, and to secure us from all dan∣ger." We came that night to <HI>Garlisle</HI> and found a small house without the fort, for the <HI>Indians</HI> to be by themselves, and hired a woman to dress their victuals, which pleased them well.</P>
<P>—30th. Setting out early, we came to <HI>Shippensburg,</HI> and were lodged in the fort, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had a house to themselves.</P>
<P>—31st. Set out early; in our passing by <HI>Chambers</HI> Fort, some of the <HI>Irish</HI> people, knowing some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in a rash man∣ner exclaimed against them, and we had some difficulty to get them off clear. At fort <HI>London</HI> we met about sixteen of the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> who came in a friendly manner to our <HI>Indians,</HI> enquiring for <HI>Bill Sockum,</HI> and shewed the pipe <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A calumet pipe; the signal of peace.</NOTE> they had received from the <HI>Shawa∣nese,</HI> and gave it, according to their custom, to smoak out of, and said, they hoped they were friends of the <HI>English.</HI> They knew me. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> begged me to give him some <HI>wampum,</HI> that he might speak to them: I gave him 400 white <HI>wampum,</HI> and he then said to them:—"We formerly had friendship one with another; we are only messengers, and cannot say much, but by these strings we let you know we are friends, and we are about settling a peace with the <HI>English,</HI> and wish to be at peace also with you, and all
<PB N="99" REF="034421_0472_0FFDA19B96F9FD10"/>
other <HI>Indians."</HI>—And informed them further, they came from a treaty, which was held at <HI>Easton,</HI> between the <HI>Eight United Na∣tions,</HI> and their confederates, and the <HI>English;</HI> in which peace was established; and shewed them the two messengers from the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who were going, with them, to make it known to all the <HI>Indians</HI> to the westward. Then the <HI>Cherokees</HI> answered and said; "they should be glad to know how far the friendship was to reach; they, for themselves, wished it might reach from the sun-rise to the sun-set; for, as they were in friendship with the <HI>English,</HI> they would be at peace with all their friends, and at war with their ene∣mies."</P>
<P>Nov. 1. We reached fort <HI>Littleton,</HI> in company with the <HI>Che∣rokees,</HI> and were lodged, in the fort; they, and our <HI>Indians,</HI> in dis∣tinct places; and they entertained each other with stories of their warlike adventures.</P>
<P>—2d. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> said to me, "you have led us this way, through the fire; if any mischief should befal us, we shall lay it entirely to you; for we think it was your doing, to bring us this way; you should have told us at <HI>Easton,</HI> if it was necessary we should go to the general."</P>
<P>I told him, "that I had informed the great men, at <HI>Easton,</HI> that I then thought it would be best not to let them go from thence, till they had seen the general's letter; and assured them that it was agreeable to the general's pleasure."</P>
<P>—3d. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> began to argue with captain <HI>Bull</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> upon the same subject, as they did with me, when I went to them with my first message; which was, "that they should tell them, whether the general would claim the land as his own, when he should drive the <HI>French</HI> away? or, whether the <HI>English</HI> thought to settle the country? We are always jealous the <HI>English</HI> will take the land from us. Look, brother, what makes you come with such a large body of men, and make such large roads into our country; we could drive away the <HI>French</HI> ourselves, without your coming into our country."</P>
<P>Then I desired captain <HI>Bull</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> to be careful how they argued with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and be sure to say nothing, that might affront them; for it may prove to our disadvantage, when we come amongst them. This day we came to <HI>Rays-town,</HI> and with much difficulty got a place to lodge the <HI>Indians</HI> by themselves, to their satisfaction.</P>
<P>—4th. We intended to set out, but our <HI>Indians</HI> told us, the <HI>Cherokees</HI> had desired them to stay that day, as they intended to hold a council; and they desired us to read over to them the go∣vernor's
<PB N="100" REF="034421_0473_0FFDA182AD9C50B8"/>
message; which we accordingly did. <HI>Pesquitomen,</HI> finding <HI>Jenny Frazer</HI> there, who had been their prisoner, and escaped, spoke to her a little rashly. Our <HI>Indians,</HI> waiting all the day, and the <HI>Cherokees</HI> not sending to them, were displeased.</P>
<P>—5th. Rose early, and, it raining smartly, we asked our <HI>In∣dians,</HI> if they would go; which they took time to consult about.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cherokees</HI> came and told them, the <HI>English</HI> had killed about thirty of their people, for taking some horses; which they resent∣ed much; and told our <HI>Indians</HI> they had better go home, than go any farther with us, lest they should meet with the same. On hearing this, I told them how I had heard it happened; upon which our <HI>Indians</HI> said, they had behaved like fools, and brought the mischief on themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Pesquitomen,</HI> before we went from hence, made it up with <HI>Jen∣ny Frazer,</HI> and they parted good friends; and though it rained hard, we set out at 10 o'clock, and got to the foot of the <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> and lodged at the first run of water.</P>
<P>—6th. One of our horses went back; we hunted a good while for him. Then we set off, and found one of the worst roads that ever was travelled until <HI>Stoney creek.</HI> Upon the road we overtook a great number of pack horses; whereon <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> said, "Brother, now you see, if you had not come to us before, this road would not be so safe as it is; now you see, we could have destroyed all this people on the road, and great mischief would have been done, if you had not stopt, and drawn our people back."— We were informed that the general was not yet gone to fort <HI>Du∣quesne,</HI> wherefore <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> said, he was glad, and expressed, "If I can come to our towns before the general begins the attack, I know our people will draw back, and leave the <HI>French."</HI>—We lodged this night at <HI>Stoney creek.</HI></P>
<P>—7th. We arose early, and made all the haste we could on our journey; we crossed the large creek, <HI>Rehempalin,</HI> near <HI>Lawrel hill.</HI> Upon this hill we overtook the artillery; and came, before sun set, to <HI>Loyal Hanning.</HI> We were gladly received in the camp by the general, and most of the people. We made our fire near the other <HI>Indian</HI> camps; which pleased our people. Soon after some of the officers came, and spoke very rashly to our <HI>Indians,</HI> in respect to their conduct to our people; at which they were much displeased, and answered as rashly, and said, "they did not under∣stand such usage; for they were come upon a message of peace; if we had a mind to war, they knew how to help themselves; and that they were not afraid of us."</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="034421_0474_0FFDA16B1B9A96E0"/>—8th. At eleven o'clock the general called the <HI>Indians</HI> toge∣ther, the <HI>Cherokees</HI> and <HI>Catawbas</HI> being present; he spake to them in a kind and loving manner, and bid them heartily welcome to his camp, and expressed his joy to see them, and desired them to give his compliments to all their kings and captains:—He desired them that had any love for the <HI>English</HI> nation, to withdraw from the <HI>French;</HI> for if he should find them among the <HI>French,</HI> he must treat them as enemies, as he should advance with a large army very soon, and cannot wait longer on account of the winter sea∣son. After that he drank the king's health, and all that wish well to the <HI>English</HI> nation; then he drank king <HI>Beaver's, Shingas',</HI> and all the warrior's healths, and recommended us (the messengers) to their care; and desired them to give credit to what we should say. After that we went to another house with the general alone; and he shewed them the belt, and said, he would furnish them with a writing, for both the belt and string; and after a little dis∣course more, our <HI>Indians</HI> parted in love, and well satisfied. And we made all necessary preparation for our journey.</P>
<P>—9th. Some of the colonels and chief commanders wonder∣ed how I came through so many difficulties, and how I could rule and bring these people to reason, making no use of gun or sword. I told them, it is done by no other means than by faith. Then they asked me, if I had faith to venture myself to come safe through with my companions. I told them, it was in my heart to pray for them, "you know that the Lord has given many promises to his servants, and what he promises, you may depend upon, he will perform."—Then they wished us good success. We waited till almost noon for the writing of the general. We were escorted by an hundred men, rank and file, commanded by captain <HI>Haselet;</HI> we passed through a tract of good land, about six miles on the old trading path, and came to the creek again, where there is a large fine bottom, well timbered; from thence we came upon a hill, to an advanced breast work, about ten miles from the camp, well situated for strength, facing a small branch of the aforesaid creek; the hill is steep down, perpendicular about twenty feet, on the south side; which is a great defence; and on the west side the breast-work about seven feet high, where we encamped that night: Our <HI>Indian</HI> companions heard that we were to part in the morning, and that twelve men were to be sent with us, and the others, part of the company, to go towards fort <HI>Duquesne.</HI> Our <HI>Indians</HI> desired that the captain would send twenty men, instead of twelve; that if any accident should happen, they could be more able to defend themselves in returning back; "for we know, say they, the enemy will follow the smallest party." It began to rain.
<PB N="102" REF="034421_0475_0FFDA14F75ADD628"/>
Within five miles from the breast-work we departed from captain <HI>Haselet;</HI> he kept the old trading path to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Hays</HI> was ordered to accompany us to the <HI>Alleghenny</HI> river <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ohio, as it is called by the Sennecas. Alleghenny is the name of the same river in the Delaware language. Both words signify the fine, or fair river.</NOTE> with fourteen men. We went the path that leads along, the <HI>Loyal Hanning</HI> creek, where there is a rich fine bottom, land well tim∣bered, good springs and small creeks. At four o'clock we were alarmed by three men, in <HI>Indian</HI> dress; and preparation was made on both sides, for defence. <HI>Isaac Still</HI> shewed a white token, and <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> gave an <HI>Indian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lloo;</HI> after which they threw down their bundles, and ran away as fast as they could. We afterwards took up their bundles, and found that it was a small party of our men, that had been long out. We were sorry that we had scared them; for they lost their bundles with all their food. Then, I held a conference with our <HI>Indians,</HI> and asked them, if it would not be good, to send one of our <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Log stown</HI> and <HI>fort Duquesne,</HI> and call the <HI>Indians</HI> from thence, before we arrive at <HI>Kushkush∣king.</HI> They all agreed it would not be good, as they were but mes∣sengers; it must be done by their chief men. The wolves made a terrible music this night.</P>
<P>—11th. We started early, and came to the old <HI>Shawanese</HI> town, called <HI>Keckkeknepolin,</HI> grown up thick with weeds, briars and bushes, that we scarcely could get through. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> led us upon a steep hill, that our horses could hardly get up; and <HI>Tho∣mas Hickman's</HI> horse tumbled, and rolled down the hill like a wheel; on which he grew angry, and would go no further with us, and said, he would go by himself: It happened we found a path on the top of the hill. At three o'clock we came to <HI>Kiske∣meneco,</HI> an old <HI>Indian</HI> town, a rich bottom, well timbered, good fine <HI>English</HI> grass, well watered, and lays waste since the war be∣gan. We let our horses seed here, and agreed that lieutenant <HI>Hays</HI> might go back with his party; and as they were short of provisions, we, therefore, gave them a little of ours, which they took very kind of us. <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> could find no other road, and came to us again a little ashamed; we were glad to see him; and we went about three miles farther, where we made a large fire. Here the <HI>Indians</HI> looked over their presents, and grumbled at me; they thought, if they had gone the other way by <HI>Shamokin,</HI> they would have got more. Captain Bull spoke in their favour against me. Then I said to them, "I am ashamed to see you grumble about presents; I thought you were sent to establish a peace." Though I confess I was not pleased that the <HI>Indians</HI> were so slightly fitted out from <HI>Easton,</HI> as the general had nothing to
<PB N="103" REF="034421_0476_0FFDA16D93B27B00"/>
give them, in the critical circumstances he was in, fit for their pur∣pose.</P>
<P>—12th. Early in the morning, I spoke to the <HI>Indians</HI> of my company, "Brethren, you have now passed through the heart of the country back and forward, likewise through the midst of the army, without any difficulty or danger; you have seen and heard a great deal. When I was among you, at <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> you told me, I should not regard what the common people would say, but only hearken to the chiefs; I should take no bad stories along. I did accordingly; and when I left <HI>Alleghenny</HI> I dropt all evil reports, and only carried the agreeable news, which was pleasing to all that heard it. Now, brethren, I beg of you to do the same, and to drop all evil reports, which you may have heard of bad people, and only to observe and keep what you have heard of our rulers, and the wise people, so that all your young men, women and children, may rejoice at our coming to them, and may have the benefit of it."</P>
<P>They took it very kindly. After awhile they spoke in the fol∣lowing manner to us, and said, "Brethren, when you come to <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> you must not mind the prisoners, and have nothing to do with them. Mr. <HI>Post,</HI> when he was first there, listened too much to the prisoners; the <HI>Indians</HI> were almost mad with him for it, and would have confined him for it; for, they said, he had wrote something of them."</P>
<P>As we were hunting for our horses, we found <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI>'s horse dead, which rolled yesterday down the hill. At one o'clock we came to the <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> to an old <HI>Shawano</HI> town, situated under a high hill on the east, opposite an island of about one hundred acres, very rich land, well timbered. We looked for a place to cross the river, but in vain; we then went smartly to work, and made a raft; we cut the wood, and carried it to the water side. The wolves and owls made a great noise in the night.</P>
<P>—13th. We got up early, and boiled some chocolate for breakfast, and then began to finish our rafts; we cloathed ourselves as well as we could in <HI>Indian</HI> dress; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, before we all got over to the other side, near an old <HI>Indian</HI> town. The <HI>Indians</HI> told us, we should not call Mr. <HI>Bull, captain,</HI> their young men would be mad that we brought a warrior there. We went up a steep hill, good land, to the creek <HI>Cowe∣wanick,</HI> where we made our fire. They wanted to hunt for meat, and looked for a road. Captain <HI>Bull</HI> shot a squirrel, and broke his gun. I cut fire wood, and boiled some chocolate for supper. The others came home, and brought nothing. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> wanted
<PB N="104" REF="034421_0477_0FFDA185325694D8"/>
to hear the writing from the general, which we read to them, to their great satisfaction. This was the first night we slept in the open air. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> took the tent along with him. We discoursed a good deal of the night together.</P>
<P>—14th. We rose early, and thought to make good progress on our way. At one o'clock <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> shot a large buck; and, as our people were hungry for meat, we made our camp there, and called the water <HI>Buck run.</HI> In the evening we heard the great guns fire from <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI> Whenever I looked to∣wards that place, I felt a dismal impression, the very place seemed shocking and dark. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> looked his things over, and found a white belt, sent by the commissioners of trade,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Persons appointed by law to manage the <HI>Indian</HI> trade, for the public; the pri∣vate trade, on account of its abuses, being abolished.</NOTE> for the <HI>Indian</HI> affairs. We could find no writing concerning the belt, and did not know what was the signification thereof: They seemed much con∣cerned to know it.</P>
<P>—15th. We arose early, and had a good day's journey; we passed these two days through thick bushes of briars and thorns; so that it was very difficult to get through. We crossed the creek <HI>Paquakonink;</HI> the land is very indifferent. At twelve o'clock we crossed the road from <HI>Venango</HI> to <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI> We went west to∣wards <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> about sixteen miles from the fort. We went over a large barren plain, and made our lodging by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> told us▪ we must send a messenger, to let them know of our coming, as the <HI>French</HI> live amongst them; he desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> string of wampum; I gave him three hundred and fifty. We concluded to go within three miles of <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦gar cabbins,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Where they boil into sugar the juice of a tree that grows in those rich lands.</NOTE> and to call their chiefs there. In discourse, Mr. Bull told the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> should let all the prisoners stay amongst them, that liked to stay.</P>
<P>—16th. We met two <HI>Indians</HI> on the road, and sat down with them to dinner. They informed us that no body was at home, at <HI>Kushkushking;</HI> that one hundred and sixty, from that town, were gone to war against our party. We crossed the above men∣tioned creek; good land, but hilly. Went down a long valley to <HI>Beaver</HI> creek, through old <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> a large spot of land, about three miles long; they both went with us to the town; one of them rode before us, to let the people in the town know of our coming; we found there but two men, and some women. Those, that were at home, received us kindly. <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> de∣sired us to read the message to them that were there.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="034421_0478_0FFDA16F82613508"/>—17th. There were five <HI>Frenchmen</HI> in the town; the rest were gone to war. We held a council with <HI>Delaware George,</HI> delivered him the string and presents, that were sent to him; and informed him of the general's sentiments, and what he desired of them; upon which he agreed, and complied to go with Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> to the general. Towards night <HI>Keckkenepalin</HI> came home from the war, and told us the disagreeable news, that they had fallen in with that party, that had guided us; they had killed Lieutenant <HI>Hays,</HI> and four more, and took five prisoners, the others got clear off. They had a skirmish with them within twelve miles of <HI>fort Du∣quesne.</HI> Further he told us, that one of the captives was to be burnt, which grieved us. By the prisoners they were informed of our arrival; on which they concluded to leave the <HI>French,</HI> and to hear what news we brought them. In the evening they brought a prisoner to town. We called the <HI>Indians</HI> together, that were at home, and explained the matter to them, and told them, as their own people had desired the general to give them a guide to conduct them safe home, and by a misfortune, your people have fallen in with this party, and killed five and taken five prisoners; and we are now informed that one of them is to be burnt; "Consider, my brethren, if you should give us a guide, to bring us safe on our way home, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should fall in with you, how hard you would take it."</P>
<P>They said, "Brother, it is a hard matter, and we are sorry it hath happened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>." I answered, "Let us therefore spare no pains to relieve them from any cruelty." We could scarce find a mes∣senger, that would undertake to go to <HI>Sawcung,</HI> where the prisoner was to be bunt. We promised to one named <HI>Compass,</HI> 500 black wampum, and Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> gave him a shirt and a dollar, on which he promised to go. We sent him as a messenger. By a string of wampum I spoke these words, "Brethren, consider the messengers are come home with good news, and three of your brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> with them. We desire you would pity your own young men, women and children, and use no hardships towards the cap∣tives, as having been guiding our party."</P>
<P>Afterwards the warriors informed us, that their design had not been to go to war, but that they had a mind to go to the general, and speak with him; and on the road the <HI>French</HI> made a division among them, that they could not agree; after which they were discovered by the <HI>Cherokees</HI> and <HI>Catawbas,</HI> who sled, and left their bundles, where they found an <HI>English</HI> colour. So <HI>Kekeuscung</HI> told them he would go before them to the general, if they would fol∣low low him; but they would not agree to it; and the <HI>French</HI> per∣suaded them to fall upon the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Loyal-hanning;</HI> they ac∣cordingly
<PB N="106" REF="034421_0479_0FFDA19E0D578AE8"/>
did, and as they were driven back, they fell in with that party, that guided us, which they did not know. They seemed very sorry for it.</P>
<P>—18th. Captain <HI>Bull</HI> acted as commander, without letting us know any thing, or communicating with us. He and <HI>George</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eved a prisoner from the warriors, by what means I do not kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w. When the warriors were met, he then called us first to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and to hear what they had to say. The <HI>Indian</HI> that de∣livered the prisoner to <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"My brethren, the <HI>English</HI> are at such a distance from us, as if they were under ground, that I cannot hear them. I am very glad to hear from you such good news; and I am very sorry that it happened so, that I went to war. Now I let the general know, he should consider his young men, and if you should have any of us, to set them at liberty, so as we do to you.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> said, "As the Governor gave these three messengers into my bosom, so I now likewise, by this string of wampum, give <HI>Bull</HI> into <HI>Delaware George</HI>'s bosom, to bring him safe to the general." Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> sat down with the prisoner, who gave him some intelligence in writing; at which the <HI>Indians</HI> grew very jealous, and asked them what they had to write there? I wrote a letter to the general by Mr. <HI>Bull.</HI> In the afternoon Mr. <HI>Bull, Delaware George,</HI> and <HI>Kesk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>epalen</HI> set out for the camp. To∣wards night they brought in another prisoner. When Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and company were gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> took the same prisoner, whom Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> had relieved, and bound him and carried him to another town, without our knowledge. I a thousand times wished Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> had never meddled in the affair, fearing they would ex∣ceedingly punish, and bring the prisoner to confession of the con∣tents of the writing.</P>
<P>—19th. A great many of the warriors came home. The <HI>French</HI> had infused bad notions into the <HI>Indians,</HI> by means of the letters, they found upon Lieutenant <HI>Hays,</HI> who was killed, which they falsely interpreted to them, viz. That, in one letter it was wrote, that the general should do all that was in his power to con∣quer the <HI>French,</HI> and, in the mean time the messengers to the <HI>Indians</HI> should do their utmost to draw the <HI>Indians</HI> back, and keep them together in conferences, till he, the general, had made a conquest of the <HI>French,</HI> and afterwards he should fall upon all <HI>Indians,</HI> and destroy them. And, that, if we should lose our lives, the <HI>English</HI> would carry on the war, so long as an <HI>Indian,</HI> or <HI>Frenchman</HI> was alive. Thereupon the French said to the <HI>Indians;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="034421_0480_0FFDA187C61557B0"/>"Now you can see, my children, how the <HI>English</HI> want to de∣ceive you, and if it would not offend you, I would go and knock these messengers on the head, before you should be deceived by them." One of the <HI>Indian</HI> captains spoke to the <HI>French</HI> and said, "To be sure it would offend us, if you should offer to knock them on the head. If you have a mind to go to war, go to the <HI>English</HI> army, and knock them on the head, and not these three men, that come with a message to us."</P>
<P>After this speech the <HI>Indians</HI> went all off, and left the <HI>French.</HI> Nevertheless it had enraged some of the young people, and made them suspicious; so that it was a precarious time for us. I said, "Brethren, have good courage, and be strong; let not every wind disturb your mind; let the <HI>French</HI> bring the letter here; for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you cannot read, they may tell you thousands of false stories. We will read the letter to you. As <HI>Isaac Still</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Indian</HI> with an <HI>English</HI> name. An <HI>Indian</HI> sometimes changes his name with an <HI>Englishman</HI> he respects: it is a seal of friendship, and creates a kind of relation between them.</NOTE> can read, he will tell you the truth."</P>
<P>After this all the young men were gathered together, <HI>Isaac Still</HI> being in company. The young men said, "One that had but half an eye could see that the <HI>English</HI> only intended to cheat them; and that it was best to knock every one of us messengers on the head."</P>
<P>Then <HI>Isaac</HI> began to speak and said, "I am ashamed to hear such talking from you; you are but boys like me; you should not talk of such a thing. There have been thirteen nations at <HI>Easton,</HI> where they have established a firm peace with the <HI>English;</HI> and I have heard that the Five Nations were always called the wisest; go tell them that they are fools, and cannot see; and tell them that you are kings, and wise men. Go and tell the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chiefs so, that are here; and you will become great men." Afterwards they were all still, and said not one word more.</P>
<P>—20th. There came a great many more together in the town, and brought <HI>Henry Osten,</HI> the serjeant, who was to have been burnt. They hallooed the war halloo; and the men and women beat him till he came into the house.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When a prisoner is brought to an <HI>Indian</HI> town, he runs a kind of gauntlet thro' the mob; and every one, even the children, endeavour to have a stroke at him; but as soon as he can get into any of their huts, he is under protection, and refreshments are administered to him.</NOTE> It is a grievous and me∣lancholy sight to see our fellow mortals so abused. <HI>Isaac Still</HI> had a long discourse with the <HI>French</HI> captain; who made himself
<PB N="108" REF="034421_0481_0FFDA1F626313CA8"/>
great, by telling how he had fought the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Loyal-Hanning. Isaac</HI> rallied him, and said he had seen them scalp horses, and take others for food. The first he denied, but the second he owned. <HI>Isaac</HI> ran the captain quite down, before them all. The <HI>French</HI> captain spoke with the two <HI>Cayugas;</HI> at last the <HI>Cayugas</HI> spoke very sharp to him, so that he grew pale, and was quite silent.</P>
<P>These three days past was precarious time for us. We were warned not to go far from the house; because the people who came from the slaughter, having been driven back, were possessed with a murdering spirit; which led them as in a halter, in which they were catched, and with bloody vengeance were thirsty and drunk. This afforded a melancholy prospect. <HI>Isaac Still</HI> was himself du∣bious of our lives. We did not let Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> know of the dang∣er. I said, "As God hath stopped the mouth of the lions, that they could not devour <HI>Daniel,</HI> so he will preserve us from their fury, and bring us through." I had a discourse with Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> concerning our message, and begged him he would pray to God for grace and wisdom, that he would grant us peace among this people. We will remain in stillness, and not look to our own credit. We are in the service of our king and country. This people are rebellious in heart; now we are here to reconcile them again to the General, Governor, and the <HI>English</HI> nation; to turn them again from their errors. And I wished that God would grant us his grace, whereby we may do it; which I hope and believe he will do. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> took it to heart and was convinced of all; which much rejoiced me. I begged <HI>Isaac Still</HI> to watch over himself, and not to be discouraged; for I hoped the storm would soon pass by.</P>
<P>In the afternoon all the captains gathered together in the middle town; they sent for us, and desired we should give them informa∣tion of our message. Accordingly we did. We read the message with great satisfaction to them. It was a great pleasure both to them and us. The number of captains and counsellors were six∣teen. In the evening messengers arrived from <HI>fort Duquesne,</HI> with a string of wampum from the commander; upon which they all came together in the house where we lodged. The messengers delivered their string, with these words from their father, the <HI>French</HI> King:</P>
<P>"My children, come to me, and hear what I have to say. The <HI>English</HI> are coming with an army to destroy both you and me. I there∣fore desire you immediately, my children, to hasten with all the young men; we will drive the <HI>English</HI> and destroy them. I, as a father, will tell you always what is best." He laid the string before one of the captains. After a little conversation, the captain stood up
<PB N="109" REF="034421_0482_0FFDA18A32480E18"/>
and said; "I have just heard something of our brethren the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> which pleaseth me much better. I will not go. Give it to the others, may be they will go." The messenger took up again the string and said, "He won't go, he has heard of the <HI>English."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>E. I.</HI> He has listened to the <HI>English</HI> messages.</NOTE> Then all cried out, "yes, yes, we have heard from the <HI>English."</HI> He then threw the string to the other fire place, where the other captains were; but they kicked it from one to another, as if it was a snake. Captain <HI>Peter</HI> took a stick, and with it slung the string from one end of the room to the other,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Kicking the string about, and throwing it with a stick, not touching it with their hands, were marks of dislike of the message, that accompanied it.</NOTE> and said, "Give it to the <HI>French</HI> captain, and let him go with his young men; he boasted much of his fighting; now let us see his fighting. We have often ventured our lives for him; and had hardly a loaf of bread, when we came to him; and now he thinks we should jump to serve him." Then we saw the <HI>French</HI> captain mortified to the uttermost; he looked as pale as death. The <HI>Indians</HI> discoursed and joked till midnight; and the <HI>French</HI> captain sent messengers at midnight to <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI></P>
<P>—21st. We were informed that the general was within twenty miles of <HI>fort Duquesne.</HI> As the <HI>Indians</HI> were afraid the <HI>English</HI> would come over the river <HI>Ohio,</HI> I spoke with some of the captains, and told them that, "I supposed the general intended to surround the <HI>French,</HI> and therefore must come to this side the river; but we assure you that he will not come to your towns to hurt you." I begged them to let the <HI>Shawanese</HI> at <HI>Logstown,</HI> know it, and gave them four strings of 300 wampum, with this message; "Brethren, we are arrived with good news, waiting for you; we desire you to be strong, and remember the ancient friendship your grandfa∣thers had with the <HI>English.</HI> We wish you would remember it, and pity your young men, women and children, and keep away from the <HI>French;</HI> and if the <HI>English</HI> should come to surround the <HI>French,</HI> be not afraid. We assure you they won't hurt you,"</P>
<P>—22d. <HI>Kittiuskund</HI> came home, and sent for us, being very glad to see us. He informed us, the general was within fifteen miles of the <HI>French fort;</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> had uncovered their houses, and laid the roofs round the fort to set it on fire, and made ready to go off, and would demolish the fort, and let the <HI>English</HI> have the bare ground; saying; "they are not able to build a strong fort this winter; and we will be early enough in the spring to destroy them. We will come with seventeen nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> and a great many <HI>French,</HI> and build a stone fort."</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="034421_0483_0FFDA151371A04A0"/>The <HI>Indians</HI> danced round the fire till midnight, for joy of their brethren, the <HI>English</HI> coming. There went some scouting parties towards the army. Some of the captains told me, that <HI>Shamokin Daniel,</HI> who came with me in my former journey, had fairly sold me to the <HI>French;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had been very much displeased, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had brought me away.</P>
<P>—23d. The <HI>liar</HI> raised a story, as if the <HI>English</HI> were divided into three bodies, to come on this side the river. They told us the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> that came with us, had said so. We told the <HI>Cayu∣gas</HI> of it; on which they called the other <HI>Indians</HI> together; denied that they ever said so; and said, they were sent to this place from the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to tell them to do their best endeavors to send the <HI>French</HI> off from this country; and when that was done, they would go and tell the general to go back over the mountains.</P>
<P>I see the <HI>Indians</HI> concern themselves very much about the affair of land; and are continually jealous, and afraid the <HI>English</HI> will take their land. I told them to be still and content themselves, "for there are some chiefs of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with the army; they will settle the affair, as they are the chief owners of the land; and it will be well for you to come and speak with the general your∣selves."</P>
<P><HI>Isaac Still</HI> asked the <HI>French</HI> captain, whether it was true, that <HI>Daniel</HI> had sold me to the <HI>French?</HI> He owned it, and said, I was theirs, they had bought me fairly; and, if the <HI>Indians</HI> would give them leave, he would take me.</P>
<P>—24th. We hanged out the <HI>English</HI> flag, in spite of the <HI>French;</HI> on which our prisoners folded their hands, in hopes that their redemption was nigh, looking up to God, which melted my heart in tears, and prayers to God, to hear their prayers, and change the times, and the situation, which our prisoners are in, and under which they groan. "O Lord, said they, when will our redemp∣tion come, that we shall be delivered, and return home?"—And if any accident happeneth, which the <HI>Indians</HI> dislike, the prisoners all tremble with fear, saying, "Lord, what will become of us, and what will be the end of our lives?" So that they often wish themselves rather under the ground, than in this life. King Beaver came home, and called us to his house, and saluted us in a friend∣ly manner; which we, in like manner, did to him. Afterwards I spoke by four strings of 350 wampum, and said, as followeth:</P>
<P>"I have a salutation to you, and all your people, from the ge∣neral, the governor, and many other gentlemen. Brother, it pleases me that the day is come to see you and your people. We have warmed ourselves by your fire, and waited for you, and
<PB N="111" REF="034421_0484_0FFDA1A0B75CC678"/>
thank you, that you did come home. We have good news of great importance; which we hope will make you, and all your people's hearts glad. By these strings I desire you would be pleased to call all your kings and captains, from all the towns and nations; so that they all may hear us, and have the benefit thereof, while they live, and their children after them."</P>
<P>Then he said, "As soon as I heard of your coming, I rose up directly to come to you." Then there came another message, which called me to another place, where six kings of six nations were met together. I sent them word, they should sit together a while, and smoke their pipes, and I would come to them. King Beaver said further,</P>
<P>"Brother, it pleaseth me to hear that you brought such good news; and my heart rejoices already at what you said to me. It rejoices me that I have now heard of you." I said, "Brother, you did well, that you first came here, before you went to the kings; as the good news we brought is to all nations, from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same; that want to be in peace and friendship with the <HI>English.</HI> So it will give them satisfaction, when they hear it." The <HI>French</HI> captain told us, that they would demolish the fort; and he thought the <HI>English</HI> would be to-day at the place.</P>
<P>—25th <HI>Shingas</HI> came home, and saluted us in a friendly man∣ner, and so did <HI>Beaver,</HI> in our house; and then they told us, they would hear our message; and we perceived that the <HI>French</HI> captain had an inclination to hear it. We called <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shin∣gas,</HI> and informed them, that all the nations, at <HI>Easton,</HI> had agreed with the governor, that every thing should be kept secret from the ears and eyes of the <HI>French.</HI> He said, "it was no matter, they were beaten already. It is good news, and if he would say any thing, we would tell him what friendship we have together." Accordingly they met together, and the <HI>French</HI> captain was pre∣sent. The number consisted of about fifty.</P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> first spoke to his men, "Hearken, all you captains and warriors, here are our brethren, the <HI>English;</HI> I wish that you may give attention, and take notice of what they say. As it is for our good, that there may an everlasting peace be established, although there is a great deal of mischief done, if it pleaseth God to help us, we may live in peace again."</P>
<P>Then I began to speak by four strings to them, and said,</P>
<P>"Brethren, being come here to see you, I perceive your bodies are all stained with blood, and observe tears and sorrows in your eyes: With this string I clean your body from blood, and wipe
<PB N="112" REF="034421_0485_0FFDA1B6D6968438"/>
and anoint your eyes with the healing oil, so that you may see your brethren clearly. And as so many storms have blown since we last saw one another, and we are at such a distance from you, that you could not rightly hear us as yet, I, by this string, take a soft feather, and with that good oil, our grandfathers used, open and clear your ears, so that you may both hear and understand what your brethren have to say to you. And by these strings I clear your throat from the dust, and take all the bitterness out of your heart, and clear the passage from the heart to the throat, that you may speak freely with your brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> from the heart."</P>
<P>Then <HI>Isaac Still</HI> gave the pipe, sent by the <HI>Friends</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who first set on soot these negociations of peace; and for whom the <HI>Indians</HI> have always had a great regard.</NOTE>, filled with tobacco, and handed round, after their custom, and said:</P>
<P>"Brethren, here is the pipe, which your grandfathers used to smoke with, when they met together in councils of peace. And here is some of that good tobacco, prepared for our grandfathers from God:—When you shall taste of it, you shall feel it through all your body; and it will put you in remembrance of the good councils, your grandfathers used to hold with the <HI>English,</HI> your brethren, and that ancient friendship, they had together."</P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> rose, and thanked us first, that we had cleaned his body from the blood, and wiped the tears and sorrow from his eyes, and opened his ears, so that now he could well hear and un∣derstand. Likewise he returned thanks for the <HI>pipe and tobacco,</HI> that we brought, which our grandfathers used to smoke. He said, —"When I tasted that good tobacco, I felt it all through my body, and it made me all over well."</P>
<P>Then we delivered the messages, as followeth:</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Denny's</HI> answer to the message of the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> brought by <HI>Frederick Post, Pesquitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman.</HI></P>
<P>"By this string, my <HI>Indian</HI> brethren of the United Nations and <HI>Delawares,</HI> join with me, in requiring of the <HI>Indian</HI> councils, to which these following messages shall be presented, to keep every thing private from the eyes and ears of the <HI>French."</HI> A string.</P>
<P>"Brethren, we received your message by <HI>Pesquitomen</HI> and <HI>Fre∣derick Post,</HI> and thank you for the care you have taken of our mes∣senger of peace, and that you have put him in your bosom, and protected him against our enemy, <HI>Onontio,</HI> and his children, and sent him safe back to our council fire, by the same man, that re∣ceived him from us." A string.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="034421_0486_0FFDA1B22EA34520"/>"Brethren, I only sent <HI>Post</HI> to peep into your cabbins, and to know the sentiments of your old men, and to look at your faces, to see how you look. And I am glad to hear from him, that you look friendly; and that there still remain some sparks of love to∣wards us. It is what we believed before hand, and therefore we never let slip the chain of friendship, but held it fast, on our side, and it has never dropt out of our hands. By this belt we desire that you will dig up your end of the chain of friendship, that you suffered, by the subt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety of the <HI>French,</HI> to be buried." A belt.</P>
<P>"Brethren, it happened that the governor of <HI>Jersey</HI> was with me, and a great many <HI>Indian</HI> brethren, sitting in council at Easton, when your messengers arrived; and it gave pleasure to every one that heard it; and it will afford the same satisfaction to our neigh∣boring governors, and their people, when they come to hear it. I shall send messengers to them, and acquaint them with what you have said.</P>
<P>"Your requesting us to let the king of <HI>England</HI> know your good dispositions we took to heart, and shall let him know it; and we will speak in your favor to his majesty, who has, for some time past, looked upon you as his lost children. And we can assure you, that, as a tender father over all his children, he will forgive what is past, and receive you again into his arms." A belt.</P>
<P>"Brethren, if you are in earnest to be reconciled to us, you will keep your young men from attacking our country, and killing, and carrying captive our back inhabitants: And will likewise give orders, that your people may be kept at a distance from <HI>Fort Du∣quesne;</HI> that they may not be hurt by our warriors, who are sent by our king to chastise the <HI>French,</HI> and not to hurt you. Consider the commanding officer of that army treads heavy, and would be very sorry to hurt any of his <HI>Indian</HI> brethren." A large belt.</P>
<P>"And brethren, the chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> with their cousins, our brethren, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and others now here, jointly with me send this belt, which has upon it two figures, that repre∣sent all the <HI>English,</HI> and all the <HI>Indians,</HI> now present, taking hands, and delivering it to <HI>Pesquitomen;</HI> and we desire it may be likewise sent to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are named at the end of these messages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Sastaghretsy, Anigh Kalicken, Atowateany, Towigh, Towighroano, Geghda∣geghroano, Oyaghta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont, Sisaghroano, Stiaggeghroano, Jenontadynago."</NOTE>; as they have all been formerly our very good friends and allies; and we desire they will all go from among the <HI>French</HI> to their own towns, and no longer help the <HI>French."</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Brethren on the Ohio,</HI> if you take the belts we just now gave you, in which all here join, <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> as we do not

doubt you will; then, by this belt, I make a road for you, and in∣vite you to come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to your first old council fire, which was kindled when we first saw one another; which fire we will kindle up again, and remove all disputes, and renew the old and first treaties of friendship. This is a clear and open road for you; fear, therefore, nothing, and come to us with as many as can be of the <HI>Delawares, Shawaness,</HI> or of the <HI>Six Nations:</HI> We will be glad to see you; we desire all tribes and nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> who are in alliance with you, may come. As soon as we hear of your coming, of which you will give us timely notice, we will lay up provisions for you along the road."</P>
<P>A large white belt, with the figure of a man, at each end, and streaks of black, representing the road from the <HI>Ohio</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, the <HI>Six Nation</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> chiefs join with me in those belts, which are tied together, to signify our union and friendship for each other; with them we jointly take the <HI>tomahawks</HI> out of your hands, and bury them under ground.</P>
<P>"We speak aloud, so as you may hear us; you see we all stand together, joined hand in hand." Two belts tied together.</P>
<P>"General <HI>Forbes</HI> to the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and <HI>Delawares,</HI> on the <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, I embrace this opportunity by our brother, <HI>Pesquito∣men,</HI> who is now on his return home with some of your uncles, of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> from the treaty of <HI>Easton,</HI> of giving you joy of the happy conclusion of that great council, which is perfectly agreea∣ble to me; as it is for the mutual advantage of our brethren, the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as the <HI>English</HI> nation.</P>
<P>"I am glad to find that all past disputes and animosities are now finally settled, and amicably adjusted; and I hope they will be for ever buried in oblivion, and that you will now again be firmly unit∣ed in the interest of your brethren, the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>"As I am now advancing, at the head of a large army, against his majesty's enemies, the <HI>French,</HI> on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> I must strongly re∣commend to you to send immediate notice to any of your people, who may be at the <HI>French</HI> fort, to return forthwith to your towns; where you may sit by your fires, with your wives and children, quiet and undisturbed, and smoke your pipes in safety. Let the <HI>French</HI> fight their own battles, as they were the first cause of the war, and the occasion of the long difference, which hath subsisted between you and your brethren, the <HI>English;</HI> but I must entreat you to restrain your young men from crossing the <HI>Ohio,</HI> as it will be impossible for me to distinguish them from our enemies; which I expect you will comply with, without delay; lest, by your ne∣glect thereof, I should be the innocent cause of some of our bre∣thren's
<PB N="115" REF="034421_0488_0FFDA18BC70568B8"/>
death. This advice take and keep in your own breasts, and suffer it not to reach the ears of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>"As a proof of the truth and sincerity of what I say, and to confirm the tender regard I have for the lives and welfare of our brethren, on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> I send you this string of wampum.</P>
<P>"I am, brethren and warriors, Your friend and brother, JOHN FORBES."</P>
<P>"Brethren, kings <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas,</HI> and all the warriors, who join with you:</P>
<P>"The many acts of hostility, committed by the <HI>French</HI> against the <HI>British</HI> subjects, made it necessary for the king to take up arms, in their defence, and to redress their wrongs, which have been done them; heaven hath favoured the justice of the cause, and given success to his fleets and armies, in different parts of the world. I have received his commands, with regard to what is to be done on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and shall endeavour to act like a soldier, by driving the <HI>French</HI> from thence, or destroying them.</P>
<P>"It is a particular pleasure to me to learn, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> who inhabit near that river, have lately excluded a treaty of peace with the <HI>English;</HI> by which the ancient friendship is renewed with their brethren, and fixed on a firmer foundation than ever. May it be lasting and unmoveable as the mountains. I make no doubt but it gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es you equal satisfaction, and that you will unite your en∣deavours with mine, and all the governors of these provinces, to strengthen it: The clouds, that, for some time, hung over the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and their friends, the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and kept them both in darkness, are now dispersed, and the chearful light now again shines upon us, and warms us both. May it continue to do so, while the sun and moon give light.</P>
<P>"Your people, who were sent to us, were received by us with open arms; they were kindly entertained, while they were here; and I have taken care that they shall return safe to you; with them come trusty messengers, whom I earnestly recommend to your protection; they have several matters in charge; and I desire you may give credit to what they say; in particular, they have a large belt of wampum, and by this belt we let you know, that it is agreed by me, and all the governors, that there shall be an everlasting peace with all the <HI>Indians,</HI> established as sure as the mountains, be∣tween the <HI>English</HI> nation and the <HI>Indians,</HI> all over, from the sun rising to the sun setting; and as your influence on them is great, so you will make it known to all the different nations, that want
<PB N="116" REF="034421_0489_0FFDA18DDB694DB0"/>
to be in friendship with the <HI>English;</HI> and I hope, by your means and persuasions, many will lay hold on this belt, and immediately withdraw from the <HI>French:</HI> this will be greatly to their own inter∣est and your honor, and I shall not fail to acquaint the great king of it: I sincerely wish it, for their good; for it will fill me with concern, to find any of you joined with the <HI>French;</HI> as in that case, you must be sensible I must treat them as enemies; howe∣ver, I once more repeat, that there is no time to be lost; for I in∣tend to march with the army very soon; and I hope to enjoy the pleasure of thanking you for your zeal, and of entertaining you in the fort ere long. In the mean time I wish happiness and pros∣perity to you, your women and children.</P>
<P>"I write to you as a warrior should, that is, with candour and love, and I recommend secrecy and dispatch.</P>
<P>"I am, kings <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas,</HI> And brother warriors, Your assured friend and brother, JOHN FORBES.</P>
<P>"From my camp at <HI>Loyalhannon,</HI> Nov. 9, 1758."</P>
<P>The messages pleased, and gave satisfaction to all the hearers, except the <HI>French</HI> captain. He shook his head with bitter grief, and often changed his countenance. <HI>Isaac Still</HI> ran down the <HI>French</HI> captain with great boldness, and pointed at him saying, "There he sits." Afterwards <HI>Shingas</HI> rose up and said:</P>
<P>"Brethren, now we have rightly heard and understood you, it pleaseth me and all the young men, that hear it; we shall think of it, and take it into due consideration; and when we have consider∣ed it well, then we will give you an answer, and send it to all the towns and nations, as you desired us."</P>
<P>We thanked them and wished them good success in their under∣taking; and wished it might have the same effect upon all other nations, that may hereafter hear it, as it had on them. We went a little out of the house. In the mean time <HI>Isaac Still</HI> demanded the letter, which the <HI>French</HI> had falsely interpreted, that it might be read in public. Then they called us back, and I, <HI>Frederick Post,</HI> found it was my own letter, I had wrote to the general. I therefore stood up, and read it, which Isaac interpreted. The <HI>In∣dians</HI> were well pleased, and took it as if it was written to them; thereupon they all said; "We always thought the <HI>French</HI> report
<PB N="117" REF="034421_0490_0FFDA1548EBD0688"/>
of the letter was a lie; they always deceived us:" Pointing at the <HI>French</HI> captain; who, bowing down his head, turned quite pale, and could look no one in the face. All the <HI>Indians</HI> began to mock and laugh at him; he could hold it no longer, and went out. Then the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief delivered a string, in the name of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with these words:</P>
<P>"Cousins, hear what I have to say; I see you are sorry, and the tears stand in your eyes. I would open your ears, and clear your eyes from tears, so that you may see, and hear what your uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have to say. We have established a friend∣ship with your brethren, the <HI>English.</HI> We see that you are all over bloody, on your body; I clean the heart from the dust, and your eyes from the tears, and your bodies from the blood, that you may hear and see your brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> and appear clean before them, and that you may speak from the heart with them."</P>
<P>Delivered four strings.</P>
<P>Then he shewed to them a string from the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> with these words:</P>
<P>"Nephews, we let you know, that we are exceeding glad that there is such a firm friendship established, on so good a foundation, with so many nations, that it will last for ever; and, as the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have agreed with the <HI>English,</HI> so we wish that you may lay hold of the same friendship. We will remind you, that we were formerly good friends. Likewise we let you know, that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> gave us a <HI>tomahawk,</HI> and, if any body offended us, we should strike him with it; likewise they gave me a knife, to take off the scalp. So we let you know, that we are desirous to hear very soon from you, what you determine. It may be we shall use the hatchet very soon, therefore I long to hear from you."</P>
<P>Then the council broke up. After a little while messengers arrived, and <HI>Beaver</HI> came into our house, and gave us the pleasure to hear, that the <HI>English</HI> had the field, and that the <HI>French</HI> had demolished and burnt the place entirely, and went off; that the commander is gone with two hundred men to <HI>Venango,</HI> and the rest gone down the river in battoes, to the lower <HI>Shawanese</HI> town, with an intention to build a fort there; they were seen yesterday passing by <HI>Sawcung.</HI></P>
<P>We ended this day with pleasure and great satisfaction on both sides: the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief said, he would speak further to them to∣morrow.</P>
<P>—26th. We met together about ten o'clock. First, King <HI>Beaver</HI> addressed himself to the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief, and said;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="034421_0491_0FFDA1CD97A5B9E8"/>"My uncles, as it is customary to answer one another, so I thank you, that you took so much notice of your cousins, and that you have wiped the tears from our eyes, and cleaned our bodies from the blood; when you spoke to me I saw myself all over bloody; and since you cleaned me I feel myself quite pleasant through my whole body, and I can see the sun shine clear over us."</P>
<P>Delivered four strings.</P>
<P>He said further, "As you took so much pains, and came a great way through the bushes, I, by this string, clean you from the sweat, and clean the dust out of your throat, so that you may speak what you have to say from your brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> and our uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to your cousins, I am ready to hear."</P>
<P>Then <HI>Petiniontonka,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief, took the belt with eight diamonds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diamond figures, formed by beads of wampum, of different colours.</NOTE> and said;</P>
<P>"Cousins, take notice of what I have to say; we let you know what agreement we have made with our brethren, the <HI>English.</HI> We had almost slipt and dropt the chain of friendship with our brethren, the <HI>English;</HI> now we let you know that we have renew∣ed the peace and friendship with our brethren, the <HI>English;</HI> and we have made a new agreement with them. We see that you have dropt the peace and friendship with them. We desire you would lay hold of the covenant, we have made with our brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> and be strong. We likewise take the <HI>tomahawk</HI> out of your hands, that you received from the white people; use it no longer; fling the <HI>towahawk</HI> away; it is the white people's; let them use it among themselves; it is theirs, and they are of one colour; let them fight with one another, and do you be still and quiet in <HI>Kushkushking.</HI> Let our grandchildren, the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> like∣wise know of the covenant, we established with our friends, the <HI>English,</HI> and also let all other nations know it."</P>
<P>Then he explained to them the eight diamonds, on the belt, signifying the five united nations, and the three younger nations, which join them: these all united with the <HI>English.</HI> Then he proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"Brethren," (delivering a belt with eight diamonds, the second belt) "we hear that you did not sit right; and when I came I found you in a moving posture, ready to jump towards the sun∣set; so we will set you at ease, and quietly down, that you may sit well at <HI>Kushkushking;</HI> and we desire you to be strong; and if you will be strong, your women and children will see from day to day the light shining more over them; and our children and grand
<PB N="119" REF="034421_0492_0FFDA156FA3E2030"/>
children will see that there will be an everlasting peace established. We desire you to be still; we do not know as yet, what to do; towards the spring you shall hear from your uncles what they con∣clude; in the mean time do you sit still by your fire at <HI>Kushkush∣king."</HI></P>
<P>In the evening the devil made a general disturbance, to hinder them in their good disposition. It was reported they saw three <HI>Catawba Indians</HI> in their town; and they roved about all that cold night, in great fear and confusion. When I consider with what tyranny and power the prince of this world rules over this people, it breaks my heart over them; and I wish that God would have mercy upon them, and that their redemption may draw nigh, and open their eyes, that they may see what bondage they are in, and deliver them from the evil.</P>
<P>—27th. We waited all the day for an answer. <HI>Beaver</HI> came and told us, "They were busy all the day long," He said, "It is a great matter, and wants much consideration. We are three tribes, which must separately agree among ourselves; it takes time before we hear each agreement, and the particulars thereof." He desired us to read our message once more to them in private; we told them, we were at their service at any time; and then we ex∣plained him the whole again. There arrived a messenger from <HI>Sawcung,</HI> and informd us that four of their people were gone to our camp, to see what the <HI>English</HI> were about; and that one of them climbing upon a tree was discovered by falling down; and then our people spoke to them; three resolved to go to the other side, and one came back and brought the news, which pleased the company. Some of the captains and counsellors were together; they said, that the <HI>French</HI> would build a strong fort, at the lower <HI>Shawanese</HI> town. I answered them, "Brethren, if you suffer the French to build a fort there, you must suffer likewise the <HI>English</HI> to come and destroy the place; <HI>English</HI> will follow the <HI>French,</HI> and pursue them, let it cost whatever it will; and wherever the <HI>French</HI> settle, the <HI>English</HI> will follow and destroy them."</P>
<P>They said, "We think the same, and would endeavour to prevent it, if the <HI>English</HI> only would go back, after having drove away the <HI>French,</HI> and not settle there." I said, "I can tell you no cer∣tainty in this affair; it is best for you to go with us to the general, and speak with him. So much I know, that they only want to establish a trade with you; and you know yourselves that you can∣not do without being supplied with such goods as you stand in need of; but, brethren, be assured you must entirely quit the <HI>French,</HI> and have no communication with them, else they will al∣ways

breed disturbance and confusion amongst you, and persuade your young people to go to war against our brethren, the <HI>English."</HI></P>
<P>I spoke with them further about <HI>Venango,</HI> and said, "I believed the <HI>English</HI> would go there, if they suffered the <HI>French</HI> longer to live there. This speech had much influence on them, and they said; "We are convinced of all that you have said; it will be so." I found them inclined to send off the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Venango;</HI> but they wanted first to know the disposition of the <HI>English,</HI> and not to suffer the <HI>French</HI> to build any where.</P>
<P>—28th. King <HI>Beaver</HI> arose early before the break of day, and bid all his people a good morning, desired them to rise early and prepare victuals; for they had to answer their brethren, the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and their uncles, and therefore they should be in a good humour and disposition. At ten o'clock they met together; <HI>Bea∣ver</HI> addressed himself to his people, and said,</P>
<P>"Take notice all you young men and warriors to what we an∣swer now: it is three days since we heard our brethren, the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and our uncles; and what we have heard of both is very good; and we are all much pleased with what we have heard. Our uncles have made an agreement, and peace is established with our brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> and they have shook hands with them; and we likewise agree in the peace and friendship, they have established be∣tween them." Then he spoke to the <HI>French</HI> captain <HI>Canaquais,</HI> and said,</P>
<P>"You may hear what I answer; it is good news, that we have heard. I have not made myself a king. My uncles have made me like a queen, that I always should mind what is good and right, and whatever I agree with, they will assist me, and help me through. Since the warriors came amongst us, I could not follow that which is good and right; which has made me heavy; and since it is my duty to do that which is good, so I will endea∣vour to do and to speak what is good, and not let myself be dis∣turbed by the warriors."</P>
<P>Then he spoke to the <HI>Mingoes,</HI> and said,</P>
<P>"My uncles, hear me: It is two days since you told me, that you have made peace and friendship, and shook hands with our brethren, the <HI>English.</HI> I am really very much pleased with what you told me; and I join with you in the same; and, as you said, I should let the <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Delamattanoes</HI> know of the agree∣ment, you have made with our brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> I took it to heart, and shall let them know it very soon."</P>
<P>He delivered a string.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="034421_0494_0FFEA8102A9FAEA0"/>"Look now, my uncles, and hear what your cousins say: you have spoke the day before yesterday to me. I have heard you. You told me, you would set me at <HI>Kushkushking</HI> easy down. I took it to heart; and I shall do so, and be still, and lay myself easy down, and keep my match-coat close to my breast. You told me, you will let me know in the next spring, what to do; so I will be still, and wait to hear from you."</P>
<P>Gave him a belt.</P>
<P>Then he turned himself to us, and gave us the following an∣swers. First, to the general;</P>
<P>"Brother, by these strings I would desire, in a most kind and friendly manner, you would be pleased to hear me what I have to say, as you are not far off.</P>
<P>"Brother, now you told me you have heard of that good agreement, that has been agreed to, at the treaty at <HI>Easton;</HI> and that you have put your hands to it, to strengthen it, so that it may last for ever. Brother, you have told me, that after you have come to hear it, you have taken it to heart, and then you sent it to me, and let me know it. Brother, I would desire you would be pleased to hear me, and I would tell you, in a most soft, lov∣ing and friendly manner, to go back over the mountain, and to stay there; for, if you will do that, I will use it for an argument, to argue with other nations of <HI>Indians.</HI> Now, brother, you have told me you have made a road clear, from the sun-set to our first old council fire, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and therefore I should fear no∣thing, and come into that road. Brother, after these far <HI>Indians</HI> shall come to hear of that good and wide road, that you have laid out for us, then they will turn and look at the road, and see no∣thing in the way; and that is the reason, that maketh me tell you to go back over the mountain again, and to stay there; for then the road will be clear, and nothing in the way."</P>
<P>Then he addressed himself to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as follows;</P>
<P>"Brother, give good attention to what I am going to say; for I speak from my heart; and think nothing the loss of it, though the strings be small.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Important matters should be accompanied with large strings, or bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sometimes▪ sufficient quantity of wampum is not at hand.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Brother, I now tell you what I have heard from you is quite agreeable to my mind; and I love to hear you. I tell you likewise, that all the chief men of <HI>Allegheny</HI> are well pleased with what you have said to us; and all my young men, women and children, that
<PB N="122" REF="034421_0495_0FFDA248B9A68B80"/>
are able to understand, are well pleased with what you have said to me.</P>
<P>"Brother, you tell me that all the Governors of the several provinces have agreed to a well established and everlasting peace with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and you likewise tell me, that my uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and my brethren, the <HI>Dalawares,</HI> and several other tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> join with you in it, to establish it, so that it may be everlasting; you likewise tell me, you have all agreed on a treaty of peace to last for ever; and for these reasons I tell you, I am pleased with what you have told me.</P>
<P>"Brother, I am heartily pleased to hear that you never let slip the chain of friendship out of your hands, which our grandfathers had between them, so that they could agree as brethren and friends in any thing.</P>
<P>"Brother, as you have been pleased to let me know of that good and desirable agreement, that you and my uncles and bre∣thren have agreed to, at the treaty of peace, I now tell you I heartily join and agree in it, and to it; and now I desire you to go on steadily in that great and good work, you have taken in hand; and I will do as you desire me to do; that is, to let the other tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> know it, and more especially my uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> my grandchildren, and all other na∣tions, settled to the westward.</P>
<P>"Brother, I desire you not to be out of patience, as I have a great many friends at a great distance; and I shall use my best en∣deavours to let them know it as soon as possible; and as soon as I obtain their answer, shall let you know it."</P>
<P>Then he gave six strings all white.</P>
<P>In the evening arrived a messenger from <HI>Sackung, Netodwehe∣ment,</HI> and desired they should make all the haste to dispatch us, and we should come to <HI>Sackung;</HI> for, as they did not know what is become of those three, that went to our camp, they were afraid the <HI>English</HI> would keep them, till they heard what was become of us, their messengers.</P>
<P>—29th. Before day break <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> came, and called us into their council. They had been all the night together. They said; "Brethren, now is the day coming, you will set off from here. It is a good many days since we heard you; and what we have heard is very pleasing and agreeable to us. It rejoices all our hearts; and all our young men, women and children, that are capable to understand, are really very well pleased with what they have heard; it is so agreeable to us, that we never received such good news before; we think God had made it so; he pities us,
<PB N="123" REF="034421_0496_0FFDA24B475503A0"/>
and has mercy on us. And now, brethren, you desire that I should let it be known to all other nations; and I shall let them know very soon. Therefore <HI>Shingas</HI> cannot go with you. He must go with me, to help me in this great work; and I shall send nobody, but go myself, to make it known to all nations."</P>
<P>Then we thanked them for their care; and wished him good success on his journey and undertaking: and, as this message had such a good effect on them, we hoped it would have the same on all other nations, when they came to hear it. I hoped that all the clouds would pass away, and the chearful light would shine over all nations: so I wished them good assistance and help on their journey. Farther, he said to us;</P>
<P>"Now we desire you to be strong;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word, <HI>wishicksey,</HI> translated, <HI>be strong,</HI> is of a very extensive signification be strong, be steady, pursue to effect what you hare begun, &amp;c.</NOTE> because I shall make it my strong argument with other nations; but as we have given cre∣dit to what you have said, hoping it is true, and we agree to it; if it should prove the contrary, it would make me so ashamed, that I never could lift up my head, and never undertake to speak any word more for the interest of the <HI>English."</HI></P>
<P>I told them, "Brethren, you will remember that it was wrote to you by the general, that you might give credit to what we say; so I am glad to hear of you, that you give credit; and we assure you, that what we have told you is the truth; and you will find it so."</P>
<P>They said further, "Brethren, we let you know, that the <HI>French</HI> have used our people kindly, in every respect; they have used them like gentlemen, especially those that live near them. So they have treated the chiefs. Now we desire you to be strong; we wish you would take the same method, and use our people well: for the other <HI>Indians</HI> will look upon us;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>I. E.</HI> They will observe how we are dressed.</NOTE> and we do not otherwise know how to convince them, and to bring them into the <HI>English</HI> interest, without your using such means as will convince them. For the <HI>French</HI> will still do more to keep them to their in∣terest."</P>
<P>I told them, "I would take it to heart, and inform the Govern∣or, and other gentlemen of it; and speak to them in their favour." Then they said, "It is so far well, and the road is cleared; but they thought we should send them another call, when they may come." I told them; "We did not know when they would have agreed with the other nations. Brother, it is you, who must give
<PB N="124" REF="034421_0497_0FFDA23808031A08"/>
up the first notice when you can come; the sooner the better; and so soon as you send us word, we will prepare for you on the road." After this we made ready for our journey.</P>
<P><HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iushund,</HI> a noted <HI>Indian,</HI> one of the chief counsellors, told us in secret; "That all the nations had jointly agreed to defend their hunting place at <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> and suffer nobody to settle there; and as these <HI>Indians</HI> are very much inclined to the <HI>English</HI> interest, so he begged us very much to tell the Governor, General, and all other people not to settle there. And if the <HI>English</HI> would draw back over the mountain, they would get all the other nations into their interest; but if they staid and settled there, all the nations would be against them; and he was afraid it would be a great war, and never come to a peace again."</P>
<P>I promised to inform the Governor, General, and all other peo∣ple of it, and repeated my former request to them, not to suffer any <HI>French</HI> to settle amongst them. After we had fetched our horses, we went from <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> and came at five o'clock to <HI>Sac∣cung,</HI> in company with twenty <HI>Indians.</HI> When we came about half way, we met a messenger from fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> with a belt from <HI>Thomas King,</HI> inviting all the chiefs to <HI>Saccung.</HI> We heard at the same time, that Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and <HI>Henry Montour</HI> would be there to day. The messenger was one of those three, that went to our camp; and it seemed to rejoice all the company; for some of them were much troubled in their minds, fearing that the <HI>En∣glish</HI> had kept them, as prisoners, or killed them. In the evening we arrived at <HI>Saccung,</HI> on the <HI>Beaver</HI> creek. We were well re∣ceived. The king provided for us. After a little while we visited Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and his company.</P>
<P>—30th. In the morning the <HI>Indians</HI> of the town visited us. About eleven o'clock about forty came together; when we read the message to them; Mr. <HI>Croghn, Henry Montour</HI> and <HI>Thomas King</HI> being present. They were all well pleased with the message. In the evening we came together with the chiefs, and explained the signification of the belts; which lasted till eleven o'clock at night.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 1st. After hunting a great while for our horses, with∣out finding them, we were obliged to give an <HI>Indian</HI> three hun∣dred wampum for looking for them. We bought corn for four hundred and fifty wampum for our horses. The Indians met to∣gether to hear what Mr. Croghn had to say. <HI>Thomas King</HI> spoke by a belt, and invited them to come to the general; upon which they all resolved to go.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="034421_0498_0FFDA23C4EA05E98"/>In the evening the captains and counsellors came together, I and <HI>Isaac Still</HI> being present; they told us, that they had formerly agreed not to give any credit to any message, sent from the English by <HI>Indians;</HI> thinking, if the <HI>English</HI> would have peace with them, they would come themselves; "So soon, therefore, as you came, it was as if the weather changed; and a great cloud passed away; and we could think again on our ancient friendship with our bre∣thren, the <HI>English.</HI> We have thought since that time, more on the <HI>English</HI> than ever before, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>though the <HI>French</HI> have done all, in their power, to prejudice our young men against the <HI>English.</HI> Since you now come the second time, we think it is God's work; he pities us, that we should not all die; and if we should not ac∣cept of the peace offered to us, we think God would forsake us."</P>
<P>In discourse, they spoke about preaching, and said, "They wished many times to hear the word of God; but they were al∣ways afraid the <HI>English</HI> would take that opportunity to bring them into bondage." They invited me to come and live amongst them; since I had taken so much pains in bringing a peace about between them and the <HI>English.</HI> I told them, "It might be, that when the peace was firmly established, I would come to proclaim the peace and love of God to them."</P>
<P>In the evening arrived a message, with a string of wampum, to a noted <HI>Indian, Ketiuscund,</HI> to come to <HI>Wenango,</HI> to meet the <HI>Una∣mi</HI> chief, <HI>Quitahicung</HI> there; he said that a <HI>French Mohock</HI> had kil∣led a <HI>Delaware Indian;</HI> and when he was asked why he did it? He said the <HI>French</HI> bid him do it.</P>
<P>—2d. Early before we set out, I gave 300 wampums to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> to buy some corn for their horses; they agreed that I should go before to the general, to acquaint him of their coming, The <HI>Beaver</HI> creek being very high, it was almost two o'clock, in the afternoon, before we came over the creek; this land seems to be very rich. I, with my companion, <HI>Kekiuscund</HI>'s son, came to Log's-town, situated on a hill. On the east end is a great piece of low land, where the old <HI>Logs-town</HI> used to stand. In the new <HI>Logs-town</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have built about thirty houses for the <HI>Indians.</HI> They have a large corn field on the south side, where the corn stands ungathered. Then we went farther through a large tract of fine land, along the river side. We came within eight miles of <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> where we lodged on a hill, in the open air. It was a cold night; and I had forgot my blanket, being packed upon Mr. Hays's horse. Between <HI>Saccung</HI> and <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> all the <HI>Shawanos</HI> towns are empty of people.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="034421_0499_0FFDA25350A54AA0"/>—3d. We started early, and came to the river by <HI>Pittsburg;</HI> we called that they should come over and fetch us; but their boats having gone adrift, they made a raft of black oak pallisadoes, which sunk as soon as it came into the water. We were very hungry, and staid on that island, where I had kept council with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the month of August last; for all I had nothing to live on, I thought myself a great deal better off now, than at that time, having now liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alk upon the island according to pleasure; and it seemed as if the dark clouds were dispersed.</P>
<P>While I waited here, I saw the general march off from <HI>Pitts∣burg;</HI> which made me sorry, that I could not have the pleasure of speaking with him. Towards evening our whole party arrived: upon which they fired from the fort with twelve great guns; and our <HI>Indians</HI> saluted again three times round with their small arms. By accident some of the <HI>Indians</HI> found a raft hid in the bushes, and Mr. Hays, coming last, went over first with two Indians. They sent us but a small allowance; so that it would not serve each round. I tied my belt a little closer, being very hungry, and nothing to eat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it often happens to the <HI>Indians,</HI> on their long marches, in war, and some∣times in their hunting expeditions, to be without victuals for several days, occasioned by bad weather and other accidents, they have this custom in such cases; which <HI>Post</HI> probably learned of them, viz. girding their bellies tight, when they have nothing to put in them; and they say it presents the pain of hunger.</NOTE> It snowed, and we were obliged to sleep without any shelter. In the evening they threw light balls from the fort; at which the <HI>Indians</HI> started, thinking they would fire at them; but seeing it was not aimed at them, they rejoiced to see them fly so high.</P>
<P>—4th. We got up early, and cleared a place from the snow, cut some fire wood, and hallooed till we were tired. Towards noon Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> came with a raft, and the <HI>Indian</HI> chiefs went over: he informed me of Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI>'s displeasure with the <HI>Indians</HI> answer to the general, and his desire that they should al∣ter their mind, in insisting upon the general's going back; but the <HI>Indians</HI> had no inclination to alter their mind. In the afternoon some provision was sent over, but a small allowance. When I came over to the fort, the council with the <HI>Indians</HI> was almost at an end. I had a discourse with Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> about the affairs, disposition and resolution of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>I drew provision for our journey to fort <HI>Ligonier,</HI> and baked bread for our whole company: towards noon the <HI>Indians</HI> met to∣gether in a conference. First king <HI>Beaver</HI> addressed himself to the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> desiring them to give their brethren an answer about
<PB N="127" REF="034421_0500_0FFDA23565B51768"/>
settling at <HI>Pittsburg.</HI> The <HI>Mohocks</HI> said, "They lived at such a distance, that they could not defend the <HI>English</HI> there, if any ac∣cident should befal them; but you, cousins, who live close here, must think what to do." Then <HI>Beaver</HI> said by a string:</P>
<P>"What this messenger has brought is very agreeable to us; and as our uncles have made peace with you, the <HI>English,</HI> and many other nations, so we likewise join, and accept of the peace offered to us; and we have already answered by your messenger, what we have to say to the general, that he should go back over the mount∣ains; we have nothing to say to the contrary."</P>
<P>Neither Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> nor <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> would tell Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> the <HI>Indians'</HI> answer. Then Mr. <HI>Croghn,</HI> Colonel <HI>Armstrong</HI> and Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> went into the tent by themselves, and I went upon my business. What they have further agreed I do not know; but when they had done, I called king <HI>Beaver, Shingas,</HI> and <HI>Kekeuscund,</HI> and said,</P>
<P>"Brethren, if you have any alteration to make, in the answer to the general, concerning leaving this place, you will be pleased to let me know." They said, they would alter nothing, "We have told them three times to leave the place and go back; but they insist upon staying here; if, therefore, they will be destroyed by the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> we cannot help them."</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> set out for <HI>Loyalhannon:</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> got some liquor between ten and eleven o'clock. One <HI>Mohock</HI> died; the others fired guns three times over him; at the last firing one had accidentally loaded his gun with a double charge: this gun burst to pieces, and broke his hand clean off; he also got a hard knock on his breast; and in the morning at nine o'clock he died, and they buried them in that place, both in one hole.</P>
<P>—6th. It was a cold morning; we swam our horses over the river, the ice running violently. Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> told me that the <HI>Indians</HI> had spoke, upon the same string that I had, to Colonel <HI>Bouquet,</HI> and altered their mind; and had agreed and desired that 200 men should stay at the fort. I refused to make any alteration in the answer to the general, till I myself did hear it of the <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI> at which Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> grew very angry. I told him I had already spoke with the <HI>Indians;</HI> he said, it was a d—d lie; and desired Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> to enquire of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and take down in writing what they said. Accordingly he called them, and asked them, if they had altered their speech, or spoke to Colonel <HI>Bou∣quet</HI> on that string they gave me. <HI>Shingas</HI> and the other counsel∣lor said, they had spoken nothing to Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> on the string
<PB N="128" REF="034421_0501_0FFDA268F268B578"/>
they gave me, but what was agreed between the Indians at <HI>Kush∣kushking.</HI> They said, Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and <HI>Henry Montour</HI> had not spoke and acted honestly and uprightly; they bid us not alter the least, and said, "We have told them three times to go back; but they will not go, insisting upon staying here. Now you will let the governor, general, and all people know, that our desire is, that they should go back, till the other nations have joined in the peace, and then they may come and build a trading house."</P>
<P>They then repeated what they had said the 5th instant. Then we took leave of them, and promised to inform the general, go∣vernor, and all other gentle people of their disposition; and so we set out from <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> and came within fifteen miles of the breast-work; where we encamped. It snowed, and we made a little cabbin of hides.</P>
<P>—7th. Our horses were fainting, having little or no food. We came that day about twenty miles, to another breast-work; where the whole army had encamped on a hill; the water being far to fetch.</P>
<P>—8th. Between <HI>Pittsburg</HI> and fort <HI>Ligonier</HI> the country is hilly, with rich bottoms, well timbered, but scantily watered. We arrived at fort <HI>Ligonier</HI> in the afternoon, about four o'clock; where we found the general very sick; and therefore could have no opportunity to speak with him.</P>
<P>—9th. We waited to see the general; they told us he would march the next day, and we should go with him. Captain <HI>Sinclair</HI> wrote us a return for provisions for four days.</P>
<P>—10th. The general was still sick; so that he could not go on the journey.</P>
<P>—11th. We longed very much to go farther; and therefore spoke to Major <HI>Halket,</HI> and desired him to enquire of the general, if he intended to speak with us, or, if we might go; as we were in a poor condition, for want of linen, and other necessaries. He desired us to bring the <HI>Indians'</HI> answer, and our journal to the ge∣neral. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> read his journal to Major <HI>Halket</HI> and Governor <HI>Glen.</HI> They took memorandums, and went to the general.</P>
<P>—12th. They told us we should stay till the general went.</P>
<P>—14th. The general intended to go; but his horses could not be found. They thought the <HI>Indians</HI> had carried them off. They hunted all day for the horses, but could not find them. I spoke to Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> about our allowance being so small, that we could hardly subsist; and that we were without money; and
<PB N="129" REF="034421_0502_0FFDA25187C935B8"/>
desired him to let us have some money, that we might buy neces∣saries. Provisions, and every thing is exceeding dear. One pound of bread cost a shilling; one pound of sugar four shillings, a quart of rum seven shillings and six pence, and so in propor∣tion. Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> laid our matters before the general; who let me call, and excused himself, that his distemper had hindered him from speaking with me; and promised to help me in every thing I should want, and ordered him to give me some money. He said farther, that I often should call; and when he was alone he would speak with me.</P>
<P>—16th. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> being a hunting, was so lucky as to find the general's horses, and brought them home; for which the gene∣ral was very thankful to him.</P>
<P>—17th. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> being desired by Major <HI>Halket</HI> to go and look for the other horses, went, but found none.</P>
<P>—18th. The general told me to hold myself ready, to go with him down the country.</P>
<P>—20th. After we had been out two days, to hunt for our horses, in the rain, we went again to day, and were informed, they had been seen in a lost condition; one laying on the hill, and the other standing; they had been hoppled together; but a person told us, he had cut the hopples. When we came home we found the horses; they having made home to the fort.</P>
<P>—22d. It was cold and stormy weather.</P>
<P>—23d. I hunted for our horses, and having found them, we gave them both to the king's commissary; they not being able to carry us farther.</P>
<P>The serjeant <HI>Henry Osten,</HI> being one of the company that guid∣ed us, as above mentioned, and was that same prisoner, whom the <HI>Shavanos</HI> intended to burn alive, came to day to the fort. He was much rejoiced to see us, and said, "I thank you a thousand times for my deliverance from the fire; and think it not too much to be at your service my whole life time." He gave us intelligence that the <HI>Indians</HI> were, as yet, mightily for the <HI>English.</HI> His mas∣ter had offered to set him at liberty, and bring him to <HI>Pittsburg</HI> if he would promise him ten gallons of rum; which he did; and he was brought safe to <HI>Pittsburg. Delaware George</HI> is still faithful to the <HI>English;</HI> and was very helpful to procure his liberty. <HI>Isaac Still, Shingas</HI> and <HI>Beaver</HI> are gone with the message to the nations living further off. When the <HI>French</HI> had heard that the garrison, at <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> consisted only of 200 men, they resolved to go down
<PB N="130" REF="034421_0503_0FFDA23DD7021F18"/>
from <HI>Venango,</HI> and destroy the <HI>English</HI> fort. So soon as the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Kushkushking,</HI> heard of their intention, they sent a message to the <HI>French,</HI> desiring them to draw back; for they would have no war in their country. The friendly <HI>Indians</HI> have sent out parties with that intention, that if the <HI>French</HI> went on, in their march towards the fort, they would catch them, and bring them to the <HI>English.</HI> They shewed to <HI>Osten</HI> the place, where eight <HI>French In∣dian</HI> spies had lain near the fort. By their marks upon the place they learned that these eight were gone back, and five more were to come to the same place again. He told us further, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had spoke among themselves, that if the <HI>English</HI> would join them, they would go to <HI>Venango,</HI> and destroy the <HI>French</HI> there. We hear that the friendly <HI>Indians</HI> intend to hunt round the fort, at <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> and bring the garrison fresh meat. And upon this intelligence the general sent Captain <HI>Wedderholz</HI> with fifty men, to reinforce the garrison at <HI>Pittsburg.</HI></P>
<P>—25th. The people in the camp prepared for a <HI>Christmas</HI> frolick; but I kept <HI>Christmas</HI> in the woods by myself.</P>
<P>—26th. To day an express came from <HI>Pittsburg</HI> to inform the general, that the French had called all the <HI>Indians</HI> in their interest together, and intended to come and destroy them there.</P>
<P>—27th. Towards noon the general set out; which caused a great joy among the garrison, which had hitherto lain in tents, but now being a smaller company, could be more comfortably lodged. It snowed the whole day. We encamped by a <HI>beaver dam,</HI> under <HI>Laurel Hill.</HI></P>
<P>—28th. We came to <HI>Stony Creek,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Quichsell</HI> is stationed. The general sent Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> express, to fort <HI>Bedford (Rays Town)</HI> and commanded him to see, if the place for en∣campment, under the <HI>Allegheny</HI> mountain, was prepared; as also to take care that refreshments should be at hand, at his coming. It was stormy and snowed all the day.</P>
<P>—29th. On the road I came up with some waggons; and found my horses with the company; who had taken my horse up, and intended to carry the same away. We encamped on this side, under the <HI>Allegheny</HI> hill.</P>
<P>—30th. Very early I hunted for my horses, but in vain, and therefore was obliged to carry my saddle bags, and other baggage on my back. The burden was heavy, the roads bad; which made me very tired, and came late to <HI>Bedford;</HI> where I took my old lodging with Mr. <HI>Frazier.</HI> They received me kindly, and re∣freshed me according to their ability.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="034421_0504_0FFDA24708E8C6E8"/>—31st. This day we rested, and, contrary to expectation, preparation was made for moving further to-morrow. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> who has his lodging with the commander of that place, visited me:</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 1st. 1759. We set out early. I got my saddle bags upon a waggon; but my bed and covering I carried upon my back; and came that day to the crossing of <HI>Juniata;</HI> where I had poor lodgings, being obliged to sleep in the open air, the night being very cold.</P>
<P>—2d. We set out early. I wondered very much that the horses, in these slippery roads, came so well with the waggons over these steep hills. We came to fort <HI>Littleton;</HI> where I drew provisions; but could not find any who had bread, to exchange for flour. I took lodging in a common house. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> arrived late.</P>
<P>—3d. We rose early. I thought to travel the nearest road to <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>Town,</HI> and therefore desired leave of the general to pro∣secute my journey to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and wait for his excellency there; but he desired me to follow in his company. It snowed, freezed, rained, and was stormy the whole day. All were exceeding glad that the general arrived safe at fort <HI>Loudon.</HI> There was no room in the fort for such a great company; I, therefore, and some others went two miles further, and got lodgings at a plantation.</P>
<P>—4th. I and my company took the upper road; which is three miles nearer to <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>town,</HI> where we arrived this even∣ing. The slippery roads made me, as a traveller, very tired.</P>
<P>—5th. To day I staid here for the general. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> went ten miles further, to see some of his relations. In the afternoon <HI>Israel Pemberton</HI> came from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to wait upon the general.</P>
<P>—6th. I came to-day ten miles to Mr. <HI>Miller</HI>'s, where I lodged, having no comfortable place in <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>town;</HI> all the houses being crowded with people.</P>
<P>—7th. They made preparation, at Mr. <HI>Millers,</HI> for the re∣ception of the general; but he, being so well to-day, resolved to go as far as <HI>Carlisle.</HI> I could scarce find any lodging there. <HI>Henry Montour</HI> was so kind as to take me in his room.</P>
<P>—8th. I begged the general for leave to go to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> hav∣ing some business, which he at last granted. I went to captain Sinclair for a horse, who ordered me to go to the chief justice of the town; who ought to procure one for me, in the province ser∣vice. According to this order I went; but the justice told me, that he did not know how to get any horse; if I would go and look for one, he should be glad if I found any. But having no
<PB N="132" REF="034421_0505_0FFDA272611617C0"/>
mind to run from one to another, I resolved to walk, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had done before: and so travelled along, and came about ten miles that day to a tavern keeper's, named <HI>Chesnut.</HI></P>
<P>—9th. To-day I crossed the <HI>Susquahanna</HI> over the ice, and came within thirteen miles of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> It was slippery and heavy travelling.</P>
<P>—10th. It rained all the day. I arrived at three o'clock, in the afternoon, in <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and was quite refreshed, to have the favour to see my brethren.</P>
