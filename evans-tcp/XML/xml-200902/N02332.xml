<Q><BIBL><HI>MALACHI III. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>They shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that Day, when I make up my Jewels.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND may <HI>We,</HI> Poor, Mean, Vile Bits of <HI>Clay,</HI> hope to be chang'd into, and found among, these Radiant <HI>Jewels? Lord, make us Thine, and we shall be so!</HI></P>
<P>THE Prophetic Spirit in the <HI>Conclusion</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> foretells four hundred Years before they were accomplished, the Things that were to occur at the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the <HI>New.</HI> He foretells the coming of the RE∣DEEMER, and of His <HI>Harbinger;</HI> and the <HI>Frame</HI> and the <HI>Fate</HI> of the People, at the Time when these Illustrious Predictions, were to have their Accomplishment. There would be a <HI>wicked People,</HI> who should be but <HI>Stubble</HI> in the Day of <HI>Burning Wrath,</HI> which would come from GOD upon the <HI>Jewish Nation.</HI> Un∣to these GOD would <HI>leave neither Root nor
<PB N="2" REF="002766_0004_0FE62C46D01B4698"/>Branch;</HI> They were to be rejected of GOD; and they that should be left of them, would be standing Monuments of the <HI>Divine Venge∣ance</HI> for the Admonition of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But there would be also a <HI>Godly People;</HI> who would studiously animate and establish One a∣nother, in the <HI>Faith</HI> of their only SAVIOUR. Of these it is foretold, <HI>They shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in the Day when I make up my Jewels.</HI> None but <HI>They</HI> shall now be owned by the GOD of Heaven, for True <HI>Israelites; They,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> associated with them, who should now take the place of the abdi∣cated <HI>Jews</HI> in the Kingdom of GOD, and be a <HI>Surrogate Israel. These</HI> the Glorious GOD, would now wonderfully distinguish with His Favour: They should be of as much Regard with Him, as any <HI>Jewels</HI> can be to the owner of them.</P>
<P>THE DOCTRINE whereto I demand your Attention, is This.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD; And there will be a Day, when GOD our SAVIOUR will do <HI>That</HI> for His <HI>Children,</HI> which will be a <HI>making up</HI> of His <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a very Instructive Action in a Roman Lady; who, when her Friends Visiting of her, desired her to show them her <HI>Jewels,</HI> as they
<PB N="3" REF="002766_0005_0FE62C663AE73D28"/>had successively, each in their Turn, Shown her <HI>Theirs,</HI> brought in her Well-educated <HI>Children,</HI> and said, <HI>If you would see my Jewels, These are They! I have no Jewels comparable un∣to These?</HI> But, How much more Instructively, and with an how much more grateful Enter∣tainment, are the Regenerated <HI>Children</HI> of GOD now to be brought forth, and have this Declaration made concerning them; <HI>These are the Jewels of GOD: When GOD shall make up His Jewels, these will be among them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. WE will Enquire, first. On what Accounts it is, that the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD are to be look'd upon, as the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Glorious LORD.</P>
<P>NOW, In general, The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are to Him, what a Valuable <HI>Treasure</HI> is to the Children of Men. When King <HI>Solomon</HI> had furnished himself with a store of <HI>Jewels,</HI> he said, Eccl. II. 8. <HI>I gathered me the peculiar Treasure of Kings.</HI> In the <HI>Wealth</HI> of King <HI>He∣zekiah,</HI> we find this Article; 1 Chron. XXXII. 27. <HI>He, made himself Treasuries for precious stones, and for all manner of pleasant Jewels.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are to Him, a much more Valuable <HI>Treasure,</HI> than those <HI>Jewels</HI> were to the <HI>Kings of the East</HI> The <HI>Great King whose Name is Venerable,</HI> sets a Value on His <HI>Children,</HI> and they are as a <HI>Treasure</HI> to Him. <HI>Lord, What is Man that thou dost so magnify him!</HI> The Hebrew Word, <HI>Segullah,</HI> which is here translated <HI>Jewels,</HI> carries a <HI>peculiar Treasure,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002766_0006_0FE62C46D58D22B8"/>in the Signification of it. It leads us to the Promise which the Glorious GOD made unto His People; Exod. XIX. 5. <HI>If ye will indeed obey my Voice, ye shall be a peculiar Treasure un∣to me, above all People.</HI> There is an <HI>Israel,</HI> of which we are told Psal. CXXXV. 4. <HI>The Lord hath chosen Israel for His peculiar Treasure.</HI> All that <HI>Fear GOD and work Righteousness in every Nation,</HI> are the <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD. All that <HI>Walk according to the Rule</HI> which is given us in the Gospel of GOD, are the <HI>Israel of GOD.</HI> We that are <HI>afar off,</HI> and the Children of such as were <HI>Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel,</HI> yea, though we should be the Children of <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> yet, if we <HI>worship GOD in the Spi∣rit, and Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> we are of as much Account with GOD as they that of old had <HI>Confidence in the Flesh,</HI> and we are the genuine Children of <HI>Israel.</HI> Of whatever Na∣tion we are, if we <HI>Live unto GOD,</HI> and <HI>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</HI> we are <HI>Israelites indeed.</HI> The Glorious GOD owns us for His <HI>Children;</HI> and we are His <HI>peculiar Treasure.</HI> 'Tis but a Translation of the <HI>Segullah,</HI> which we render <HI>Jewels,</HI> that the People of GOD, even all the <HI>Redeemed</HI> of the Lord, and the Believers &amp; Followers of the Great REDEEM∣ER, are called, Tit. II. 14. <HI>A Peculiar Treasure.</HI></P>
<P>MY Friends, Let the <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> be our <HI>Treasure,</HI> and let us count our selves <HI>Rich,</HI> yea, the <HI>Rich Heirs of all things,</HI> in having the Glorious GOD and His CHRIST, for our
<PB N="5" REF="002766_0007_0FE62BD2DCF5FC78"/><HI>Portion.</HI> Then our GOD will make <HI>us</HI> His <HI>Treasure,</HI> and we shall be more to Him, than a <HI>whole World</HI> left <HI>lying in Wickedness.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we will proceed more particularly to consider, the Accounts on which these XEIMHAIA as we may call them, of GOD our SAVI∣OUR, may be call'd, The <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Glori∣ous Lord.</P>
<P>First. THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, How <HI>Dear,</HI> How <HI>Dear,</HI> unto Him are they? No Prince can set such a Price upon His <HI>Jewels,</HI> as the Glorious GOD sets upon His <HI>Children.</HI> He says of them, <HI>They are the dearly beloved of my Soul.</HI> He says to them, <HI>I have loved thee with an everlasting Love.</HI> About this Cabinet of <HI>Jewels,</HI> we find Him saying, Isai. XLIII. 4. <HI>Thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been Honourable; and I have loved thee; Therefore will I give Men for thee, and People for thy Life.</HI> So <HI>precious</HI> are these <HI>Jewels,</HI> to the Glorious GOD, that He will <HI>Destroy</HI> every thing that stands in the way of the Good which He has to do for them. So <HI>precious</HI> are they, that in Times of com∣mon Desolation, He sets a <HI>Mark</HI> upon them for their <HI>Signal</HI> Preservation. So <HI>precious</HI> are they, that He gives His <HI>Angels charge</HI> over them, and commits them to the <HI>Ministring Spirits,</HI> with a command unto them, to take these <HI>Heirs of Salvation</HI> into their Custody. Yea, the Highest among those who <HI>Ride upon the High places of the Earth,</HI> altho' they should
<PB N="6" REF="002766_0008_0FE62C49B17FC890"/>he those who wear cloth of Gold, all studded with <HI>Jewels,</HI> are not of such <HI>precious Esteem</HI> with the Glorious GOD, as His <HI>Children</HI> that <HI>Chuse the things that please Him,</HI> though they make never so mean an Appearance, and are the <HI>poor People in Vile Raiment,</HI> whom the <HI>Proud Ones</HI> of the Earth, would have to <HI>sit un∣der their Footstool.</HI> Indeed, They have nothing in and of themselves to recommend them unto a <HI>precious Esteem</HI> with GOD. If GOD have any <HI>Esteem</HI> for them, <HI>'Tis even so, Father, be∣cause it pleases thee!</HI> The only <HI>Reason</HI> of the <HI>Esteem</HI> which the Glorious GOD has for any, is that <HI>Reason of all Reasons,</HI> His <HI>Good Plea∣sure;</HI> which says, <HI>I loved thee, because I loved thee.</HI> And it must be said, as it is, in Ezek. XVI. 11, 12, 14. <HI>I decked thee with Ornaments, and I put a Jewel on thy Forchead; it was my comeliness which I put upon thee, faith the Lord GOD.</HI> Even so; O Child of GOD, If thou art made a <HI>Jewel,</HI> 'tis from the <HI>Comeliness</HI> which the <HI>Lord GOD</HI> Himself has given to thee.</P>
<P>Secondly. THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, How much <HI>Better</HI> are they, than the <HI>common Chil∣dren of Men,</HI> that are no more than so? Ve∣rily, as much <HI>Better,</HI> as <HI>Jewels</HI> are better than the <HI>common Stones</HI> of the <HI>Street,</HI> and of the <HI>Field!</HI> He was a competent Judge, who said of such; Psal. XVI. 3. <HI>They are the Saints in the Earth, and the Excellent in whom is all my Delight.</HI> This <HI>Excellent</HI> Man had a Son, who
<PB N="7" REF="002766_0009_0FE62BD2E1D7CD98"/>espoused his Fathers Maxims, and has left this unto us; Prov. XII. 26. <HI>The Righteous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> They are <HI>Desireable</HI> Ones: A Change of their <HI>Nature</HI> has made them so. The <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and of their Neighbour coming to reign in them, has made them so. These <HI>Renewed</HI> Ones, by a <HI>Sanctify∣ing Work</HI> of GOD upon them, come to be Per∣sons of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> Yea, If <HI>Wisdom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Dark∣ness,</HI> then these <HI>Children of Light</HI> are more <HI>Ex∣cellent</HI> than they who <HI>walk in Darkness.</HI> Their <HI>Principles</HI> are <HI>Excellent Principles,</HI> and their <HI>Practices</HI> are <HI>Excellent Practices.</HI> There are <HI>Engravings</HI> upon these <HI>Jewels;</HI> The <HI>Image</HI> of GOD is <HI>Engraved</HI> upon them. There is a <HI>Worth</HI> in them. The Wicked who are <HI>little Worth,</HI> may truly say to the least of these, <HI>Thou art worth Ten Thousand of us.</HI> Indeed, they study to <HI>Do Good;</HI> while the Wicked are but so many <HI>Hinder goods.</HI> They are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the <HI>Societies</HI> they belong unto; inasmuch as they study to be <HI>Blessings</HI> unto the <HI>Societies.</HI> They <HI>Exalt the City</HI> that has them in it. All that are concerned in them, fare the <HI>Better</HI> for them. They are called, <HI>Profitable Ones.</HI> If there were nothing else, yet the very <HI>Prayers</HI> of these <HI>Humble Ones,</HI> help to fetch down <HI>Blessings</HI> on all about them: When the <HI>Chil∣dren of the Wicked One,</HI> only pull down <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> on the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002766_0010_0FE62C49B634BD50"/>
Thirdly. THEY <HI>Shine!</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD have a singular <HI>Lustre</HI> in them. These <HI>Jewe's</HI> have a sparkling Beauty in them. Their <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> causes their <HI>Faces to shine;</HI> Their <HI>Wisdom</HI> gives an <HI>Ornament of Grace</HI> unto them. GOD is <HI>Light;</HI> and they have so much of GOD in them, that it may be said of them, <HI>Truly, The Light in them is sweet.</HI> Yea, it has been said, Phil. II. 15. <HI>Ye shine as Lights in the World.</HI> No sooner did they turn to GOD, but there was that Voice of Heaven over them, <HI>Arise and shine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee.</HI> Henceforward, they become <HI>Lights;</HI> Yea, not only <HI>Shining</HI> but <HI>Burning Lights,</HI> and such as are to be <HI>Rejoyced in.</HI> Being <HI>Illuminated of GOD,</HI> they become the <HI>Guides of the Blind,</HI> the <HI>Lights of them that are in Darkness,</HI> the <HI>Instructors of the Foolish.</HI> They are so <HI>Enlightned</HI> from the <HI>Sun of Righ∣teousness,</HI> that GOD <HI>shines</HI> in them. And their <HI>Instruction,</HI> and their <HI>Example,</HI> is for the <HI>Enlighten∣ing</HI> of those that behold them. Their <HI>Path</HI> is as the <HI>shining Light.</HI> Of those whom our Lord makes the <HI>Teachers</HI> of others, we read, <HI>Rev.</HI> I. 16. <HI>He had in His Right Hand seven Stars. Jewels</HI> are not unlike to <HI>Stars,</HI> for their Brightness; and Writers often use the Name of the one for the other. To have <HI>Stars in the Hand,</HI> is the fame as to have <HI>Jewels</HI> that are set in <HI>Rings</HI> on the Hand. Our Lord makes His Faithful Servants to be <HI>Jewels,</HI> like <HI>Stars</HI> in His Hand; When He makes them <HI>Teachers,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002766_0011_0FE62BD4ADA0D4F8"/>and <HI>Light</HI> is from Him Communicated by them. Yea, Even with Luminous and Ethere∣al <HI>Bodies</HI> bestowed upon them, they shall one Day <HI>Shine as the Brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. YEA, more than so. The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD are what the SON of GOD Himself, wears as His <HI>Ornaments.</HI> He shows them for such, and with Pleasure says, <HI>Behold, The Chil∣dren which GOD has given me!</HI> They are the <HI>Jewels</HI> which our SAVIOUR is not only <HI>Arrayed,</HI> but even reckons Himself <HI>Adorned</HI> withal. They are so, when they <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of GOD our SAVIOUR in all things.</HI> These are they to whom our GOD says; Isai. LXII. 3. <HI>Thou shalt be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the Hond of thy GOD.</HI> They may indeed be called, <HI>Jewels of the Crown.</HI> Our Glorious Lord, uses them for His <HI>Crown;</HI> and makes His more than <HI>Royal Diadem</HI> to glitter with them. When our SA∣VIOUR says, <HI>The Righteous shall compass me a∣bout;</HI> it may be read, <HI>The Righteous shall be a Crown unto me.</HI> We find this astonishing Dig∣nity put upon some, who were eminent for Holiness, and Watchfulness, and Usefulness; 2 Cor. VIII. 23. <HI>They were the Glory of CHRIST.</HI> Our Great SAVIOUR Exhibits His Chosen and Called Ones, with the effects of His Grace up∣on them, and says, <HI>This is the People whom I have thus formed for my self; They shew forth
<PB N="10" REF="002766_0012_0FE5F4939DFE2190"/>my Praise!</HI> When they have such a <HI>Mind,</HI> and such a <HI>Walk,</HI> as He had; and when He has prepared them in <HI>every good Work to do the Will of GOD,</HI> and <HI>wrought</HI> in them what is <HI>well∣pleasing in the sight of GOD,</HI> &amp; has <HI>Forgiven</HI> their <HI>Iniquities, &amp; Relieved</HI> their <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and <HI>Crown∣ed</HI> them with His <HI>Kindnesses,</HI> Now, Helooks on them as a <HI>Glory</HI> to Him. So He produced a <HI>Job</HI> of old, as one of His <HI>Jewels;</HI> &amp; said, <HI>Hast thou con∣sidered him? Consider what a Perfect and Upright Man, there is of my making in him!</HI> And so, when He descends from Heaven, with such as will have His Work finished on them, He will then be <HI>Glorified in His Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</HI> The King of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> be∣ing surrounded with <HI>Jewels,</HI> and <HI>having every precious Stone for his covering,</HI> has his <HI>Glory</HI> so described unto us; <HI>Thou wast upon the Holy Mountain of GOD; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of Fire.</HI> Our Blessed JESUS, being surrounded with such as <HI>Delight</HI> in Him, and such as <HI>Derive</HI> the <HI>Beauties of Holiness</HI> from Him, has <HI>every preci∣ous stone for a covering;</HI> and He <HI>walks up and down in the midst of the stones of Fire.</HI> And He so displays His <HI>Glory</HI> from the <HI>Holy Mountain of GOD unto us.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. AND will He suffer any of them to be lost? No, He does <HI>Prize</HI> them too much for <HI>That;</HI> They have <HI>Cost</HI> Him too much for <HI>That.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD shall be as
<PB N="11" REF="002766_0013_0FE5F48F4B8A1DE8"/>much look'd after, as if they were His <HI>Jewels.</HI> GOD the FATHER has betrusted our SAVI∣OUR with His <HI>Children</HI> as His <HI>Jewels:</HI> And our SAVIOUR says, John X. 27. <HI>They shall ne∣ver perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my Hand.</HI> All the Attempts of Hell, to ruin the Children of GOD, or to rob Him of His <HI>Jewels,</HI> or break the <HI>Jewels</HI> to pieces, will all come to nothing. Our SAVIOUR will keep a strict <HI>Eye</HI> upon them, and for any to touch them, will be to <HI>Touch the Apple of His Eye.</HI> He has <HI>purchased</HI> them out of the Hands into which they had been <HI>forfeited:</HI> And not <HI>Silver,</HI> nor <HI>Gold,</HI> but His own <HI>precious Blood</HI> has been <HI>paid</HI> for them. They are called, <HI>His purchased Pos∣session.</HI> Hereupon, He is continually <HI>polishing</HI> of them, and bringing them into the admira∣ble <HI>Shape,</HI> in the <HI>Predestination</HI> of GOD intend∣ed for them. And, though they <HI>are an exceed∣ing great Multitude, which no Man can Number,</HI> yet not one of them shall miscarry. He will anon present them all to His Eternal FATHER, <HI>with exceeding Joy;</HI> and in Terms like those; John XVII. 12. <HI>Those that thou bast given me I have kept; and not one of them is lost. Lost!</HI> No, They shall be <HI>made up.</HI> And in the Day of their being so, then, <HI>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord, and read; no one of these shall fail,</HI> or be wanting; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord shall <HI>gather</HI> them. The Meaning of this, is what remains to be Enquired into.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="002766_0014_0FE62C512553ADE8"/>
II. WE must Enquire, <HI>When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> it is, that the Glorious LORD will <HI>make up</HI> these <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly; THERE is a Blessed <HI>Bundle of Life,</HI> whereof it was once foretold unto a very Bright one among the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD; 1 Sam. XXV. 29 <HI>The Soul of my Lord shall be bound in the Bundle of Life with the Lord thy GOD.</HI> When a Soul is brought into that <HI>Bundle,</HI> by being brought unto sincere PIETY, and so into the <HI>Life</HI> of GOD; And there shall be an <HI>Assembling</HI> of every such <HI>Soul,</HI> even, a bringing of them all together in the Enjoyment of <HI>Everlasting Life;</HI> This is the <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>THE First Thing to be affirmed, is, That our Glorious LORD <HI>makes up</HI> His <HI>Jewels,</HI> when He <HI>makes them Jewels.</HI> What we read, <HI>I make up my Jewels,</HI> may be read, <HI>I am the Maker of my Jewels.</HI> 'Tis verily so; GOD our SAVI∣OUR, may say of all His <HI>Jewels,</HI> what is in Isai. LX. 21. <HI>They are the Work of my Hands, that I may be glorified.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are no better than sorry <HI>Pebble Stones,</HI> till His Good SPIRIT Enter them, and Refine them, and Sublimate them, and make <HI>New Creatures</HI> of them. That which makes <HI>Jewels</HI> of them, is This; Eph. II. 10. <HI>We are the Workmanship of GOD, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works.</HI> Learned and Curious Things have been written by Philosophers, about, <HI>The Ori∣gin of Gems.</HI> But the true <HI>Origin</HI> of these
<PB N="13" REF="002766_0015_0FE62BD4B26D58F8"/><HI>Jewels,</HI> is a marvellous <HI>Work</HI> of GOD upon a miserable Soul, <HI>Transforming</HI> of it; and the imprinting His <HI>Image</HI> upon it, <HI>from Glory to Glory.</HI> And there is a <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels,</HI> in His thus <HI>making</HI> of them to be what now they are; and so making a <HI>Seizure</HI> on them. There is an Eternal Purpose of <HI>Election,</HI> in which it is decreed, That such a Number of <HI>Jewels</HI> is to be the <HI>Peculiar Treasure</HI> of GOD; and that such and such Persons are to make up the Number. In the <HI>Fulness of Time</HI> for it, Every <HI>Sinner converted from the Error of his way,</HI> is brought into the Possession of GOD, and actually logded among his <HI>Jewels.</HI> On every <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> there is this <HI>Joy in Heaven,</HI> [Oh! wilt thou make it, O Gospelliz∣ed Soul, upon thy being told so!] <HI>Lo, A New Accession to the Number of Jewels, with which Heaven is to be Irradiated!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, Secondly. 'TIS to be further ex∣pected, That the Final, and more perfect and compleat <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels,</HI> will be, <HI>in the Day,</HI> when our Glorious LORD will have his <HI>Jewels</HI> to be all together <HI>with Him, where He is, that they may behold His Glory.</HI> We read 2 Thes. II. 1. <HI>Concerning the coming of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and our gathering together un∣to Him.</HI> Our <HI>gathering together</HI> unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, will be His <HI>making up of His Jewels.</HI> It is in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> in the <HI>Future World,</HI> that the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD will
<PB N="14" REF="002766_0016_0FE62C512A662BF8"/>have those Things done for them, which will <HI>make up His Jewels</HI> for Him. The <HI>Jewels</HI> have continually something done towards the <HI>Mak∣ing of them up,</HI> and the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the Faith∣ful are, upon their Expiration, fetch'd away into the <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD. While the <HI>Jewels</HI> are here below, they are in the <HI>Jewellers</HI> Shop, where they are Grinding, and Cleansing, and Fitting, that they may be <HI>made meet for the In∣heritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> The Glorious LORD fetches them away, One after another, in what He will have to be the most <HI>proper Season</HI> for it. And as these are <HI>Taking up,</HI> He is therein <HI>making up</HI> the <HI>Jewels,</HI> which He will <HI>bring with Him,</HI> when He comes to the <HI>Raising of the Dead.</HI> After the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> we shall see that wondrous Thing; Heb. XII. <HI>The General Assembly of the First-born, which are enrolled in Heaven, and the Spirits of just Men made perfect. The Day</HI> when the <HI>Ge∣neral Assembly of the First born,</HI> shall be brought all together, and the Departed and Separate <HI>Spirits of the Just</HI> shall be <HI>made Perfect,</HI> in the <HI>Bodies</HI> designed for them; This, This will be <HI>the Day</HI> in which the Glorious LORD will <HI>make up His Jewels.</HI> There will then be seen the <HI>Strong City</HI> of GOD, in which he will <HI>shew His Marvellous Kindness</HI> unto <HI>His Jewels.</HI> Oh! That in the Visions of GOD, we may be now <HI>carried away,</HI> to a <HI>Great and High Moun∣tain,</HI> where we may see that <HI>Great City,</HI> the <HI>Holy Jerusalem!</HI> Christians, Take a View of
<PB N="15" REF="002766_0017_0FE62C67779FAF60"/>the dazzling and charming Spectacle! <HI>It has the Glory of GOD</HI> in it; and its <HI>Light</HI> is <HI>like unto a Stone most precious:</HI> And <HI>the Foundati∣ons of the Wall of the City, are garnished with all manner of precious Stones.</HI> The Glorious LORD will <HI>make up His Jewels,</HI> by bringing them all into that <HI>Holy City,</HI> and there <HI>filling them with all the fulness of GOD,</HI> and causing them to <HI>shine like the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father;</HI> and GOD shall be <HI>All in All</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>¶ WE may now at length Enquire, What IMPROVEMENT we are to make of these Things.</P>
<P>AND here, One might indeed propose, What <HI>Usage</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD should of Right meet withal; What <HI>Respect</HI> is due to the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, from a <HI>World,</HI> which, alas, <HI>Knows them not.</HI> Certainly, If the Glori∣ous GOD looks upon them as His <HI>Jewels,</HI> the People among whom they sojourn, should not <HI>Mal-treat</HI> them, and look on them as their <HI>Burdens</HI> or their <HI>Blemishes.</HI> No, They really are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Places wherein they are <HI>Pilgrims:</HI> And all the Citizens of <HI>Zion</HI> must count them so; Yea, of such an One we read, Psal. XV. 4. <HI>He honours them that Fear the Lord.</HI> They that have the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> conspicuous in them, and labour to <HI>Abstain from all Appear∣ance of Evil,</HI> and contrive as they <HI>have Opportu∣nity to do good unto all;</HI> What are these but the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Places where they live? The
<PB N="16" REF="002766_0018_0FE62C52E7EA6240"/>People there should <HI>honour</HI> these, as their <HI>Glory,</HI> yea, and their <HI>Defence,:</HI> Not <HI>Persecute</HI> them with <HI>Indignities,</HI> and <HI>Malignities;</HI> Not shut them out, as our <HI>Foolish Nation</HI> does at this Day many of them, from Capacities to do <HI>Good Offices</HI> for them. And when these <HI>Righte∣ous</HI> and <HI>Merciful</HI> Ones are <HI>taken away</HI> by <HI>Death;</HI> and these <HI>Godly</HI> Ones do <HI>cease,</HI> and the <HI>Faith∣ful fail from among the Children of Men,</HI> the People should <HI>lay to heart</HI> every such <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>lament</HI> it as having their <HI>Jewels</HI> therein taken from them; Yea, they should <HI>speak of such in their Lamentations many Days!</HI> But this Advice will be little entertained, by any but such as are also come into the Num∣ber and the Temper of the <HI>Jewels;</HI> For, <HI>He that is Right in the way, is an Abomination unto the Wicked!</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, To be a little Even with the <HI>Wicked,</HI> before we leave them; It might be proposed, That a <HI>just Contempt</HI> may be cast up∣on those <HI>Wicked</HI> Ones, whose <HI>Transgression</HI> says, <HI>There is no Fear of GOD before their Eyes.</HI> This also is a Character, by which the Citizens of <HI>Zion</HI> are discovered; <HI>A Vile Person is contem∣ned in the Eyes of such an One.</HI> Every One who evidently <HI>Hates</HI> GOD, and <HI>Wrongs</HI> His Neighbour, is a <HI>Vile Person.</HI> There is One, who has at this Day more Vassals than any Monarch upon Earth, but one whom the Book of GOD calls, <HI>A Vile Person.</HI> The <HI>Vicar of the Devil</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> is that <HI>Vile Person.</HI> Every <HI>De∣spiser</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002766_0019_0FE62C67822AE6B0"/>of GOD, and of Right, is worthy to be <HI>Despised:</HI> and should be <HI>Despicable</HI> in our Eyes; The Glorious GOD says, <HI>They who despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.</HI> Indeed, There are decent <HI>Civilities,</HI> wherewith we are to <HI>Honour all Men,</HI> according to the <HI>Stations</HI> wherein GOD has placed them. The <HI>Rules of Good Manners</HI> are to be observed with us, towards all that we converse withal. But yet we must preserve in our Mind a Religious <HI>Distaste</HI> and a Reasonable <HI>Disdain</HI> for those who <HI>declare their Sin as Sodom,</HI> and by notorious Impieties pro∣claim themselves the <HI>Seed of the Serpent.</HI> These <HI>Vipers,</HI> let us <HI>Trample</HI> on them! It is among the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> Prov. XXVI. 8. <HI>As he that casteth a precious Stone into an heap of Stones, so is he that giveth Honour to a Fool.</HI> When <HI>Malefactors</HI> were Executed, they laid an <HI>Heap of Stones</HI> on their Graves, and they that passed by usually cast a <HI>Stone</HI> upon the <HI>Heap.</HI> Would One throw a <HI>precious Stone</HI> on such an <HI>Heap?</HI> There are Impious Ones, worthy to be deem'd <HI>Malefactors,</HI> who are so far from <HI>Jewels,</HI> that if they have any <HI>Jewels,</HI> they are only <HI>Jewels</HI> in the <HI>Snouts</HI> of <HI>Swine;</HI> Even the <HI>Harlot</HI> in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> has her <HI>Jewels.</HI>—But for us to <HI>give Honour</HI> unto such <HI>Fools,</HI> and re∣gard-them as we would <HI>Jewels:</HI> 'Tis as bad as <HI>casting a precious Stone, into an Heap of Stones.</HI> Good Men, and the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, may before they are aware, carry their Comple∣ments too far, in <HI>falling before the Wicked;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002766_0020_0FE7564D2B17DC40"/>and GOD may chastise them for their Error in it. —</P>
<P>BUT the main Thing to be press'd upon us, is; To press after, to make out for, to make sure of, this Incomparable Felicity; That we may be found among the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD, <HI>in the Day when He shall make up His Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>IT is foretold, as the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Church in the latter Days; Isai. LIV. 11, 12. <HI>I will lay thy Foundations with Saphires; and I will make thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbun∣cles, and all thy Borders of pleasant Stones.</HI> Oh! That we who belong to this Church, may have our share in this <HI>Glory;</HI> and that we may be <HI>pleasant Stones</HI> in the <HI>Temple</HI> of our GOD.</P>
<P>THE First Thing which we are therefore to be directed to, is; Let us become <HI>the Lord's;</HI> By a most Voluntary and Immediate <HI>Resigna∣tion</HI> and <HI>Consecration</HI> of our selves unto Him, let us become <HI>the Lord's. They shall be mine,</HI> saith the Lord. And <HI>That</HI> secures their being <HI>made up among His Jewels.</HI> GOD our SAVI∣OUR makes His most Gracious Overtures unto us all; <HI>Wilt thou be Mine? Art thou willing to be comprehended in the Covenant of Life, which I have made for my People? Art thou willing to be taken under my Conduct; willing that my Sacri∣fice and my Righteousness procure thy being For∣given and Accepted of GOD! Willing that my SPIRIT should rectify all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of Order in
<PB N="19" REF="002766_0021_0FE62C6E232008F0"/>thee, &amp; bring thee to be all that I would have thee to be?</HI> O Soul-moving Overtures! O Heart-melt∣ing Overtures! Let thy Answer to these Over∣tures be That; Psal. CXIX. 94. <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</HI> The Glorious LORD will now own thee for One of His <HI>Jewels.</HI> And as the <HI>High Priest</HI> of old, had <HI>Jewels on his Breast-plate,</HI> whereon the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> had their Names Engraved: Thou art one of those, whose <HI>Names</HI> are Engraven on the <HI>Breast plate</HI> of thy SAVIOUR; He sets thee as a <HI>Seal upon His Arm.</HI> Thou art with Him, and on Him, and in Him, and as One of His <HI>Jewels,</HI> when He does as the <HI>High Priest</HI> of His People, <HI>Enter within the Vail,</HI> with an <HI>Intercession</HI> that <HI>saves to the Uttermost.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second Thing whereto we are to be directed, is This; Let us <HI>Have Jewels,</HI> and we shall <HI>Be Jewels.</HI> Let us obtain as much as we can of those things, which are the most <HI>Inesti∣mable Jewels.</HI> You shall now be pointed unto some <HI>Inestimable Jewels;</HI> whereof you are to be advised, let not such sorry <HI>Barley-Corns,</HI> as the best Things of this World, be, (as in the Ancient Parable) preferr'd with you, before such <HI>Inestimable Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>First. WHAT Think you of a Glorious CHRIST? Verily, A CHRIST, A CHRIST, is what you read; Mat. XIII. 46. <HI>A Pearl of Great Price.</HI> An <HI>Union</HI> with a CHRIST: Oh!
<PB N="20" REF="002766_0022_0FE62C52ED4FCAE0"/>No such <HI>Pearl</HI> as <HI>That;</HI> An <HI>Interest</HI> in a CHRIST; A Dying Hour will teach you to Value it above a Thousand Worlds, if you do not so before. Well; This Glorious CHRIST now offers Himself unto you all; He says, <HI>I am willing to be Thine.</HI> Oh! Thankfully, Heartily, Presently embrace the Offer, and say, <HI>I have Unsearchable Riches for mine, if I have Thee for mine, O my SAVIOUR.</HI> We read; Prov. XVII. 8. <HI>A precious Stone, whithersoever it turns, it prospers.</HI> What? Shall such a <HI>pre∣cious Stone</HI> as This be tendered, and shall it not <HI>prosper,</HI> and make its way, and find Recep∣tion, <HI>whithersoever it is tendered?</HI> O Criminal Stupidity! O Prodigious Ingratitude!</P>
<P>AGAIN; What think you of those Things, which are called, <HI>The Fruits of the Spirit!</HI> When we read of, <HI>Pure Religion and Undefiled,</HI> it is an Allusion to a <HI>Jewel,</HI> that first is no <HI>Counterfeit,</HI> and then has no <HI>Flaws</HI> in it. Let us become full of <HI>Pure and Undefiled Religion,</HI> and we shall have with us a <HI>Jewel,</HI> which there can be no Exception to. But Lo, It will transform us into itself; We shall by it be rendred such. A Disposition to <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> in all the Exercises of Evangelical Obe∣dience: What are these <HI>Graces,</HI> but so many <HI>Jewels?</HI> The Soul that has them, is <HI>the Kings Daughter, all Glorious within,</HI> from the Splen∣dour of them. The <HI>Clothing</HI> which covers the Joints or Limbs of such a Soul, is like <HI>Jewels,
<PB N="21" REF="002766_0023_0FE62BDCC4D86310"/>the Work of the Hands of a Cunning Workman.</HI> Here are those Things, which <HI>cannot be valued with the precious Onyx and the Sapphires; The Price is above Rubies; The Topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal them.</HI> They are, as we are told, 1 Pet. III. 4. <HI>Ornaments of great Price in the sight of GOD.</HI> Now, Come to your SAVIOUR for these <HI>Graces.</HI> Come to Him, <HI>Of whose Ful∣ness</HI> with them you shall <HI>receive.</HI> Come to Him, on that Encouragement, <HI>If any lack Wis∣dom, let him ask, and it shall be given him:</HI> The <HI>Jewels</HI> are to be had for <HI>Asking</HI> for.</P>
<P>ONCE more; What Think you of the <HI>Pro∣mises,</HI> in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD? The <HI>Good Words</HI> provided for the <HI>Hearts that are stooping with Heaviness?</HI> How can you reckon them any o∣ther than so many <HI>Jewels?</HI> The Value of every One among those Glittering and Peerless <HI>Con∣solations of GOD;</HI> Oh! 'Tis beyond all Com∣putation! Whole Rocks of <HI>Diamonds</HI> are not worth so much as one of these <HI>Jewels.</HI> We are told, 2 Pet. I. 4. <HI>They are exceeding Great and Precious Promises.</HI> Now lay hold on these <HI>Comforts.</HI> The <HI>Jewels</HI> become your own, upon your laying hold on them. <HI>Take</HI> them, and you <HI>Have</HI> them.</P>
<P>Finally; WHATEVER you attain unto, yet never be <HI>Jewels</HI> in your own Eyes. Ly al∣ways in the <HI>Dust.</HI> Yea, Be not Impatient, if <HI>Man</HI> as well as GOD lay you in the <HI>Dust,</HI> and if you see your selves <HI>Despised and Reject∣ed of Men.</HI> See nothing Valuable in your
<PB N="22" REF="002766_0024_0FE62C5D592E9C08"/>selves; But forever say as one of the most ful∣gent <HI>Jewels</HI> did; Job XL. 4. And, XLII. 6. <HI>Behold, I am Vile; I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> Indeed, thou hast a <HI>Soul,</HI> O Man, a <HI>Soul</HI> which thou shouldest always es∣teem as a <HI>Jewel</HI> too precious to be thrown away. But, for <HI>Thy self,</HI> Oh! Let not thy Heart be vainly lifted up, for any thing that GOD may do for thee, and by thee.</P>
<P>¶ WHILE I am speaking these Things I call to Mind, that upon the Death of an Ex∣cellent Gentlewoman, in the Primitive Church, there was that Expression used; <HI>Ex Annulo Ecclesiae Monile Perdidimus:</HI> The <HI>Ring</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> has dropt a <HI>Jewel</HI> that belonged unto it.</P>
<P>AND this draws on a Remark, That thro' the <HI>Marvellous Kindness</HI> of GOD shown unto this Part of His <HI>Holy City,</HI> Poor NEW ENG∣LAND notwithstanding all our Deficiencies and Miscarriages, and very abasing Circumstan∣ces, has had His <HI>Jewels</HI> brightening of it, in as good a Proportion, as perhaps any Region, on the Face of an Earth covered with a <HI>Flood</HI> of Ignorance and Wickedness. Yea, such the Number of them, that the Adversaries of this poor People, and they that go to Abuse them, and Oppress them, or Damnify that <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> which is continually producing the <HI>Pre∣cious Stones of Zion</HI> among them; Alas, They <HI>Know not what they do!</HI> The <HI>Milstone</HI> which
<PB N="27" REF="002766_0025_0FE62BDCC9B8D0B8"/>our SAVIOUR has told them of, would not be more uneasy than the Doom to which they Expose themselves. But how great a Propor∣tion the <HI>Female Sex</HI> has afforded of these, is a Thing to be particularly considered, for the Glory of the REDEEMER, <HI>Born of a Woman,</HI> who has Glorified His <HI>Grace,</HI> in what they have received from Him. These have not only been the <HI>Grandmothers</HI> of all the Good that has been done; and oftentimes, the <HI>Instructors</HI> that have Qualified and Instigated their Offspring to do it; but also been the <HI>Instances</HI> of much Good, and the more Immediate and very Not∣able <HI>Doers</HI> themselves, of more than a little. The <HI>Handmaids</HI> of the Lord, who bore their part in the <HI>First Planting</HI> of this Wilderness, ought forever to have their share in the <HI>Me∣mory of the Just,</HI> for their <HI>Virtues.</HI> And how many of their <HI>Daughters,</HI> have like them, <HI>Done Virtuously!</HI> — The <HI>Handmaids</HI> of the Lord, who have had their Souls betimes <HI>Espoused</HI> un∣to their SAVIOUR; and <HI>Lived by the Faith of the SON of GOD;</HI> and had their Lives filled with the <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> and the <HI>Devotion of the Temple;</HI> and studied how to be <HI>Blessings</HI> in all <HI>Relations;</HI> and been Prayerful, Patient, Humble <HI>Cross-bearers;</HI> and have at last gone away Triumphing over the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> and <HI>Rejoycing in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002766_0026_0FE62C5D5E20C0D8"/>
AMONG These, there appears a very par∣ticular <HI>Commemoration</HI> due,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">[Mrs. ELIZABETH COTTON.]</NOTE> to a Valuable &amp; Honourable GENTLEWOMAN, lately retired from us into the <HI>Chambers</HI> of the Blessed: ONE Descended of a Family, [that of SAL∣TONSTAL] that has for now Four Genera∣tions, made a Figure among us; And a Genuine SISTER, to the late most accomplished and never-to-be-forgotten GOVERNOUR of <HI>Con∣necticut,</HI> as well as many Years the <HI>Consort,</HI> and then for some Years the <HI>Widow</HI> of a worthy <HI>Minister,</HI> who for some time did worthily in <HI>Israel.</HI> Her Early PIETY; [which began to show itself at Thirteen Years of Age, but ar∣rived unto a more <HI>Confirmed State</HI> in an Assu∣rance of an <HI>Espousal</HI> to Her SAVIOUR, when she was first a <HI>Widow forsaken in Youth,</HI> by the <HI>Praemature Death</HI> of a most Hopeful Young Minister, of whom the Bereaved and Sorrow∣ful Flock in <HI>Ipswich,</HI> had said, <HI>This same shall Comfort us!</HI>] The Uncommon Prudence of her <HI>O Economy;</HI> The Large Number of <HI>Well-Educated Children,</HI> that she has presented unto the Pub∣lic; whereof this Happy <HI>Mother in Israel,</HI> had the Consolation to see several become Well-Esteemed <HI>Pastors</HI> of Churches; The Generous <HI>Assistences</HI> that she often gave to the Neigh∣bours in their various <HI>Afflictions;</HI> The <HI>Resish</HI> that she had for the Enjoyments in the <HI>House</HI> of her GOD; And indeed her whole <HI>Behaviour;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="002766_0027_0FE62C6E2820C038"/>has bespoke a grateful Remembrance of her, and a <HI>Name</HI> in the Enumeration of those whom our GOD, when he shall <HI>make up His Jewels</HI> will doubtless allow a place unto.</P>
<P>I have spoke <HI>Nothing,</HI> but what I am satis∣fied, <HI>All the City of my People</HI> do think, that it is <HI>True,</HI> and that I have done well to speak it.</P>
<P>THERE are several short Monuments of her Pen, wherein she has <HI>Written Excellent Things:</HI> and what in a more Public View would be highly Serviceable to the cause of PIETY.</P>
<P>THERE is one of them so expressive and so Instructive, that it may well pass for the Best part of my Sermon, if I now give to you all, and particularly the Daughters of our <HI>Zion,</HI> the Benefit of hearing it Read unto you.

<HEAD>A Few short <HI>Memorials</HI> of that Vertuous Woman, Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Cotton.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MRS. ELIZABETH COTTON was only Daughter to the late Ho∣nourable Colonel <HI>Nathanael Saltonstall,</HI> and Sister to the late Honourable <HI>Gurdon Sal∣tonstall</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; the Memorable Governour of <HI>Con∣necticut.</HI></P>
<P>SHE was born <HI>September</HI> 15. 1668. She was Marryed first unto Mr. <HI>John Denison,</HI> a Young Gentleman of Uncommon Accomplishments and Expectations; of whom the Church of <HI>Ipswich</HI> hoped, <HI>Under his shadow we shall sit many Years!</HI> and he was a <HI>Pastor</HI> to them, of whose <HI>Fruit</HI> they tasted with an Uncommon satisfacti∣on. By him She had the late Col. <HI>John Deni∣son.</HI> But became his Disconsolate Widow in the Year 1689.</P>
<P>SHE was after this Married unto Mr. <HI>Roland Cotton</HI> the Faithful Minister of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who
<PB N="29" REF="002766_0031_0FE62BDDD577B270"/>Died in the beginning of the Year 1722. By whom she has <HI>Ten Children</HI> left Surviving (<HI>Five</HI> of them <HI>Sons</HI>) who with Hearts full of Sorrow, and calling her <HI>Blessed,</HI> followed her unto the Grave in <HI>Boston;</HI> where she was found Prepared and Ripened for the Heavenly World; on <HI>July</HI> 9. 1726.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Dorcas</HI> was Dead they produced the Effects of her <HI>Needle,</HI> as Testimonies for her.</P>
<P>On the Death of this Gentlewoman we will produce Two or Three Effects of her <HI>Pen,</HI> which we will single out from others, because of a singular Adaptation in them to serve some <HI>Designs</HI> of PIETY which are of much more Concern to us, than the <HI>Praises</HI> of the Deceased. And in so doing, though we do not what <HI>Peter</HI> did for <HI>Dorcas,</HI> after her Expira∣tion, yet we shall in some sort <HI>present her Alive</HI> unto the People of GOD, and still in some Degree have her with us.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT may be of considerable Use, especial∣ly unto our <HI>Young People,</HI> and most of all un∣to those of the <HI>Female Sex;</HI> to Read what she wrote of, <HI>Reflections on the State of her Soul,</HI> when she was but <HI>Thirteen</HI> Years of Age.</P>
<Q><P>IT has pleased GOD by the Striving of his SPIRIT on my Heart (which I a long
<PB N="30" REF="002766_0032_0FE62C5E6279ED80"/>time neglected) to put me upon <HI>serious Con∣sideration,</HI> of the Certainty of <HI>Death,</HI> the Uncertainty of <HI>Life,</HI> the Instability and Insuf∣ficiency of any of these <HI>Creature Enjoyments,</HI> the Excellency of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and of <HI>CHRIST JESUS</HI> who so freely offered Him∣self a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> for Sin, the Unavoidableness of appearing before the Just <HI>Judge of the whole World</HI> at the Great and Last Day; The <HI>Endless Joy</HI> of such who in this Life do make sure to themselves an Interest in CHRIST; the Everlasting Duration of the <HI>Wicked</HI> in that <HI>Torment</HI> which is ineffable and intollerable.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Considerations</HI> put me on an <HI>En∣quiry,</HI> (with the Jaylor) <HI>What shall I do to be Saved?</HI> Where I found an Answer ready; <HI>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou shalt be Saved.</HI> But I found an <HI>impotency</HI> in in my self to <HI>believe,</HI> to <HI>repent,</HI> to <HI>pray,</HI> to do any <HI>good Thing</HI> after a right manner. Some∣times when I was Ruminating on such things as these, I thought it my Duty to ask, <HI>If I ever intended to receive;</HI> for to such is given a <HI>Promise,</HI> Matth. 7.7. <HI>Ask and it shall be gi∣ven to you, seek and ye shall find.</HI> I was con∣vinced that it was my Duty to <HI>pray.</HI> But I knew not <HI>how</HI> to perform this Duty; and was many times <HI>discouraged</HI> therein, by thinking on such like Texts of Scripture as these. <HI>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomi∣nation
<PB N="31" REF="002766_0033_0FE62C700B2CF258"/>to the Lord</HI> —. And, <HI>What hast thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</HI> I I do verily think and fear, my <HI>present Condi∣tion</HI> is such, that I am as yet alienated and estranged from GOD and His Ways. I take no <HI>Delight</HI> in doing his Will, and yet go on to <HI>Omit</HI> known Duties and <HI>commit</HI> manifest Sins. When I <HI>pray,</HI> it is but in a cold for∣mal Manner; and though I am thoroughly convinced of the Indispensible Necessity of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and an <HI>Interest</HI> in CHRIST, and the <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin; and also the <HI>readiness</HI> of GOD to grant it to them that desire it; Yet such is the backwardness of my Heart, that I am <HI>not willing</HI> to <HI>forsake Sin,</HI> though by foregoing the same I obtain everlasting Salvation, and by retaining it I incur Eter∣nal Damnation. Much Comfort I have re∣ceived from many Places of Scripture of late; In particular these; Isaiah. 1.17, 18. And 43.25. Ezek. 16.6, 8, 9. And 36.26, 27.</P>
<P>I have had many thoughts concerning my <HI>future State</HI> and Condition; but not so many (I fear) as to put me upon the Practice of the Apostle's Advice, of <HI>working out my Sal∣vation with Fear and Trembling;</HI> but I do yet continue in a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> in a Graceless Condition, and in such a State, that if the Judge of the whole World should Summon me <HI>this Night</HI> to appear before him, I should perish for Ever. So that sometimes when I
<PB N="32" REF="002766_0034_0FE62BC6D660DDD8"/>seriously consider of these things, The <HI>Immor∣tality</HI> of my Soul, <HI>Eternity,</HI> The <HI>last Judgment,</HI> and the Nature of the <HI>Judge,</HI> His <HI>Justice, Omniscience, Power;</HI> I know not which way to turn my self. Then whilst I am in this frame of Spirit (which is not <HI>long,</HI> for this <HI>Zeal</HI> is but Temporary and Transient) I put <HI>serious Questions</HI> to my Soul; such as these.</P>
<P><HI>O Immortal Soul! How canst thou sleep this Night, or take any Repose, whilst thou art in such a perishing State? If thou shouldast be called for this Night, what wouldst thou do? Where wouldest thou appear? Is this thy Condition? Art thou an Heir of Hell? Ah Woful State! Fly then to the Lord JESUS CHRIST for His Mercy!</HI> But, Oh, My Fears! That Rock on which I fear most to be dash'd, is, Not <HI>Des∣pair,</HI> and despondency (as I do think) For I <HI>hope</HI> by divine Assistance (without which I shall run into all manner of Evils) I shall not fall into <HI>Despair;</HI> for hi herto I have found no Propensity <HI>that way;</HI> I am fully convinc'd of the <HI>All-sufficiency</HI> of GOD, his being <HI>able</HI> to Save me, and to Pardon my Sins. And as I am convinced of his being <HI>able,</HI> so also am <HI>I</HI> of his being <HI>willing</HI> to Save. For he is a <HI>Gracious, Merciful, Tender hearted GOD.</HI> He is willing to save <HI>all</HI> that come to Him by Faith in Christ. But this is that
<PB N="35" REF="002766_0035_0FE62BE26FCE9620"/>Rock on which <HI>I</HI> fear <HI>I</HI> shall suffer Ship∣wreck; <HI>Carnal Security.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> find this <HI>Repentance</HI> to be an hard Work; A difficult Work! <HI>I</HI> must part with <HI>Bosom Sins,</HI> and a <HI>Right Eye,</HI> and a <HI>Right Hand,</HI> if <HI>I</HI> will be a Disciple of Christ.</P>
<P>I must <HI>take up a Cross,</HI> follow a Naked Christ, hate Father and Mother; These things make <HI>Repentance</HI> so repugnant to Flesh and Blood, that <HI>I</HI> daily say, though not <HI>in Word,</HI> yet <HI>Practically,</HI> and by my <HI>Actions,</HI> that <HI>I</HI> will <HI>sit at Ease in this Life,</HI> though <HI>I</HI> perish for Ever <HI>hereafter,</HI> rather than take the <HI>Pains</HI> to <HI>Repent. Lord, help me out of this Wosul State!</HI></P>
<P>THE Consideration of the <HI>Brevity</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> the <HI>Certainty of Death,</HI> and after that of the <HI>Judgment,</HI> and of <HI>Eternity, I</HI> upon this thought <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Counsel to be the best that could be given, Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth,</HI> and Health, <HI>before the Evil Days</HI> of old Age and Death <HI>do come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> have too too much cause to fear, that if <HI>I</HI> should be taken away by <HI>Sudden Death</HI> (which <HI>I</HI> pray GOD prevent while <HI>I</HI> con∣tinue in a State of Nature) <HI>I</HI> should be Eternally separated from the Presence of GOD, which is the <HI>sorest Punishment</HI> that can be inflicted on any Creature. Some∣times
<PB N="36" REF="002766_0036_0FE62C5E67367F78"/>when <HI>I</HI> hear a Sermon, I <HI>receive it with Joy,</HI> and Purpose Amendment of Life; and when <HI>I</HI> am in Fear or Danger <HI>I Vow</HI> and promise to GOD. But when <HI>I</HI> am deli∣vered <HI>I</HI> make no Conscience to perform; so that <HI>I</HI> fear my self to be worse than the <HI>Stony Ground;</HI> for <HI>that</HI> kept the Seed of the <HI>Word, till Persecution arose;</HI> but I forsake it for such and such a sinful <HI>Vanity,</HI> and hazard Eternal Damnation rather than leave my Sensualities, (for which Sins the Lord humble me!) And so, when <HI>I</HI> come to <HI>GOD's House</HI> my mind is not so much on the <HI>Word</HI> Preached as it should be. <HI>I</HI> take not that delight in <HI>Reading</HI> the Scripture, nor make that Con∣science of doing it daily as <HI>I</HI> ought to do, or should do, were I a Child of GOD. I am too negligent in that Duty of <HI>Private Prayer;</HI> and when I do go to GOD in secret, it is but in a <HI>Cold,</HI> Formal Manner. <HI>I</HI> am also too much addicted to <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Words.</HI> But notwithstanding all this, in Reading the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> I find some Gracious Invitations to Sinners, Matth. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and I will give you Rest.</HI> Isaiah 55.1. <HI>Ho every one that Thirsteth, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.</HI> But I thought, these <HI>Promises</HI> did not belong to <HI>me;</HI> for though I had a great <HI>weight of Sin,</HI> yet I was not <HI>weary</HI> there∣of, I was without <HI>Sense</HI> of it; I <HI>thirsted</HI> not after an Interest in Christ. But then I
<PB N="37" REF="002766_0037_0FE62BE275DF07E8"/>thought there were <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Invitations</HI> against which I could bring no Objection; as Matth. 7.7. <HI>Seek and ye shall find, Knock,</HI> &amp;c. And Rev. 22.17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride say, come, and whosoever will, let him come and take of the Waters of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>I am throughly convicted, that if I do my <HI>part</HI> towards the <HI>working out of my Salvation,</HI> GOD will not be wanting on <HI>His.</HI> But my Heart is so backward to any good, that I am not so willing as I should be to do any thing towards my Salvation.</P></Q>
<P N="2">II. WHEN she first became a <HI>Disconsolate Widow,</HI> which was about the <HI>Twenty first</HI> Year of her Age, that she might not go without the <HI>Consolations of GOD,</HI> she then more effectually settled her <HI>Espousal</HI> to her SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>SHE wrote several <HI>Instruments</HI> on that Occa∣sion. And she set her hand unto a large <HI>Form of coming into the Covenant</HI> of the Glorious GOD. But we shall here insert only a few lines wherein she declares her <HI>Choice of her Portion.</HI></P>
<P><Q>LORD, I desire no <HI>other Portion</HI> but <HI>thee;</HI> take the <HI>Corn</HI> and the <HI>Wine</HI> and the <HI>Oyl</HI> who∣so will! So I may have the <HI>light of thy Coun∣tenance.</HI> I pitch upon <HI>Thee</HI> for my <HI>Happiness.</HI> I gladly venture my self on <HI>Thee,</HI> and trust
<PB N="38" REF="002766_0038_0FE62BCDD5351F78"/>my self with <HI>Thee;</HI> I set my hopes in <HI>Thee;</HI> I take my <HI>Rest</HI> with <HI>Thee.</HI> Let me hear <HI>Thee</HI> say, I <HI>am thy GOD and thy Salvation,</HI> and I have <HI>enough; All</HI> I wish for! I will make <HI>no Terms</HI> with thee, but for <HI>Thy self.</HI> Let me but have <HI>Thee</HI> sure, let me be able to make my Claim and see my Title to <HI>Thy self;</HI> and for <HI>other things</HI> I leave them to Thee, give me <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less, any thing</HI> or <HI>nothing;</HI> I will <HI>be satisfyed in my GOD!</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">III. THERE was nothing whereabout She express'd a greater Sollicitude than the good <HI>Education</HI> of her Children; and She had her <HI>Heart made glad</HI> by what <HI>Harvest</HI> She saw of her Cultivations.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, for her Sons at the <HI>Colledge</HI> where they have all been favoured with a <HI>Liberal Education,</HI> Her Soul was in a continual <HI>Travail,</HI> that she might see <HI>CHRIST formed in them.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of her <HI>Maternal Counsels</HI> to <HI>these,</HI> may do good unto <HI>others.</HI> And the Copies of two short <HI>Letters</HI> to <HI>them,</HI> shall therefore be here inserted.</P>

<P>BOSTON. <HI>Saturday,</HI> July 9. 1726. Yester∣day Morning deceased here, after a short illness of a Fever, and this Evening is decent∣ly interr'd, Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Cotton,</HI> only Daugh∣ter to the late Honourable Col. <HI>Nathanael Sal∣tonstall</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; of <HI>Haverhill,</HI> and Sister to the late Honourable <HI>Gurdon Saltonstall</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; of <HI>Connecti∣cut,</HI> Governour.

<P>SHE was known to be a Person of very su∣periour Wit, Knowledge and Virtue from her Youth up. She was of a very agreeable Pre∣sence, and every way accomplish'd to shine in the Station wherein Providence set her: She was the Honour and Delight of her Husbands: and being endow'd with a very lively and ac∣tive Spirit, and a rare Discretion, Her emi∣nent virtue directed her to imploy them in a most exact and industrious care and govern∣ment of her Household, and in a most ready assistance of her Neighbours in all their Diffi∣culties, wherever she sojourned.
