</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BUT the <HI>silent Saint</HI> shall now <HI>speak aloud</HI> unto us: Even i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>holding his Peace</HI> he shall now <HI>speak aloud</HI> unto us: A <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man</HI> shall now <HI>speak</HI> unto us. It shall be done, I will not say, <HI>Miraculously,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but I hope, it will be done <HI>Remarkably,</HI> and very <HI>Proftably.</HI> The very <HI>silence</HI> will have in it a <HI>Voice</HI> to be greatly hearken'd to. And if I declare to you, That my Design is, to strike my Hearers <HI>Dumb,</HI> it will be a <HI>Kindness</HI> for theme Indeed an <HI>Angel</HI> once brought it as a <HI>Re∣buke</HI> to a good Man, for something a∣miss
<PB N="2" REF="002250_0005_0FDADA0E17326290"/>in him, <HI>Thou shalt be Dumb and not able to speak.</HI> But I am now to propose it as the <HI>Glory</HI> of a good Man, <HI>Thou shalt be Dumb, and hold thy Peace, not willing to speak. When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> and <HI>Why</HI> to <HI>hold ones peace,</HI> truly 'tis a Thing the People of GOD should be well-acquain∣ted withal.</P>
<P>BEFORE I go any further, I am to tell you, <HI>when</HI> this Duty of <HI>silence</HI> is to be Studied. It must be our study <HI>To hold our peace,</HI> when we have <HI>sad things</HI> be∣falling of us. The <HI>season</HI> of the Duty is, when we meet with grievous Occur∣rences, with heavy Calamities. <HI>How</HI> and <HI>Why</HI> the Duty is to be attended, you shall be told, after I have informed you <HI>who</HI> 'tis that gives us the Pattern of it.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>Aaron,</HI> an Eminent Minister of GOD, yea, the <HI>High-Priest of Israel. Sad Things</HI> befell the Family of this Ex∣cellent Man. Two of his Children were taken from him; yea, with very awful Circumstances taken from him. GOD Struck them Dead, with <HI>Fire from Hea∣ven.</HI> A <HI>Fire from Heaven</HI> had lately consumed the <HI>Burnt-Offerings</HI> of the <HI>Bra∣zen
<PB N="3" REF="002250_0006_0FDADA0F0CC43810"/>Altar.</HI> GOD required, That this <HI>Fire</HI> should always be kept alive with a <HI>perfetual Fuel,</HI> and be the <HI>only Fire</HI> em∣ployed in <HI>all</HI> their Offerings. But the Two Sons of <HI>Aaron,</HI> who Officiated in the <HI>Priesthood</HI> under him, imagined (as the Jews interpret the matter to us) that this <HI>Fire</HI> was only for the <HI>Burnt-Offerings:</HI> For the <HI>Altar of Incense</HI> they imagined, they might fetch their <HI>Fire</HI> elsewhere; and they did so. GOD was offended; and by striking them <HI>Dead,</HI> on the very <HI>First Day</HI> after the Service of the <HI>Altar</HI> began, and after the <HI>Seven Days</HI> for the <HI>Consecration</HI> were finished and they were to offer <HI>Sacrifices</HI> for themselves and the People, He gave a Lively Intimation, that <HI>Life</HI> was not now to be obtained or expected from <HI>that Service.</HI> No, 'tis our JESUS alone, who is the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conduct of <HI>Aaron</HI> under the <HI>sad Things</HI> which befell him and his Fami∣ly, is now to be observed. The <HI>Saint of the Lord</HI> has this Reported of him; <HI>He hold his peace.</HI> A <HI>Good Report!</HI> The Consideration which produced this <HI>Holy silence</HI> in him, was in the Message, which
<PB N="4" REF="002250_0007_0FDADA108DC446D8"/>his Brother brought from GOD unto him. <HI>The Lord said, I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh unto me; and be∣fore all the People will I be glorified.</HI> The Glorious GOD would be considered, as the Dispenser of the <HI>sad Things</HI> which the Man of GOD met withal, and would accordingly be Glorified.</P>
<P>AND now, may a DOCTRINE <HI>Worthy of all Acceptation,</HI> be by all of us duely <HI>Accepted</HI> of.</P>
<P><HI>SINCE 'tis the Glorious GOD, who is the Doer of all that in the sad Things which we meet withal is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne unto us, it becomes us to Glorify Him with an an HOLY SILENCE under them.</HI></P>
<P>I call to mind, that when <HI>David</HI> as well as <HI>Aaron,</HI> had <HI>sad Things</HI> befalling him, he gives this Account of his Con∣duct under them, Psal. XXXIX. 9. <HI>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</HI> I am very much of the Opini∣on, that when that Servant of GOD so Behaved and Expressed himself, he doubtless had in his Eye, the Story of <HI>Aaron,</HI> which I now have in mine: A Story which he could not but be well∣apprised of. So then having the Ad∣vantage
<PB N="5" REF="002250_0008_0FDADA146F241D80"/>of thus calling in <HI>David</HI> as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Aaron</HI> to support my DOCTRINE, it may now be said, those Two Bright Stars, <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> shall now ap∣pear in <HI>Conjunction;</HI> and by your <HI>Obser∣vation</HI> of them, you shall understand how to Steer in the Darkest Hours that <HI>sad Things</HI> may bring upon you. Under sad Things, the Great Thing with which we are to Glorify GOD, is PATIENCE; PATIENCE. The Thing required of us, is that, Jam. I. 4. <HI>Let Patience have its perfect work.</HI> I don't Remember that the Hebrew Language, has any Term for <HI>Patience,</HI> but that of <HI>silence.</HI> The Description which the Old Testament gives of <HI>Patience,</HI> is <HI>To be Dumb, and not Open ones Mouth.</HI> There are some, who so read, Psal. LXV. 1. <HI>Silence is praise to thee, O GOD.</HI> Our GOD is never more <HI>Praised</HI> than by our <HI>silence.</HI> Our <HI>silence</HI> under sad Things, will be a most nota∣ble <HI>Praise</HI> to our GOD. This, This, is the Grace to be now <HI>spoken</HI> of! And in speaking of it,</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to lay down the <HI>Maxim,</HI> which does command, and may even compel, the <HI>Holy silence,</HI> that is to be
<PB N="6" REF="002250_0009_0FDADA15ECB38AE0"/>preserved under <HI>sad Things</HI> befalling of us. The Maxim is this; <HI>The Glorious GOD is He who does all that is done unto us, in the sad Things we meet withal;</HI> Whatever <HI>Afflictive</HI> Thing is done unto us, the Great GOD says, <HI>I am now to be Sanctified and Glorified as the doer of it.</HI> Of every thing that proves a stroke of <HI>Adversity</HI> unto us, we must make this Confession, <HI>Lord, Thou doest it.</HI> It was demanded. Hab. II. 20. <HI>The Lord is in his Holy Temple; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all the Earth keep silence before Him.</HI> The demand shall now be, <HI>The Lord is in thy Adversity, O Child of Earthly Man, do thou keep silence before Him.</HI> Whatever <HI>sad Things</HI> we meet withal, we have not the <HI>Right Thoughts of the Righteous,</HI> if we do not think, <HI>It is the Glorious GOD who has done all that is done unto me.</HI> Indeed the sense of this, That we have to do with a Glori∣ous GOD, in all the <HI>sad Things</HI> which we meet withal, 'tis to be one Ingredi∣ent of the <HI>Holy silence</HI> wherewith we are to Glorify Him. It is not an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> but a <HI>Stupidity;</HI> yea, a <HI>Profanity,</HI> if our <HI>Patience</HI> have not the sense of a Glori∣ous GOD, for the Principle of it. Come
<PB N="7" REF="002250_0010_0FDADA1748CDF3B8"/>then, Under our <HI>sad Things,</HI> this is the First Thing to be Laboured for. Be sensible of this, that in all the <HI>sad Things</HI> which befall us, there is the <HI>Providence</HI> of a Glorious GOD at Work; A Glori∣ous GOD <HI>performing the Thing that is Ap∣pointed for us.</HI> Tis a Maxim never to be doubted of. Job. V. 6. <HI>Certainly Af∣fliction comes not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth of the Dust, neither doth Trouble spring out of the Ground.</HI> No, All our <HI>sad Things,</HI> as well as our <HI>glad Things</HI> come <HI>from Above.</HI> The <HI>sad things</HI> which we suffer from and on the Earth, are not of a meer <HI>Earthly Original.</HI> The <HI>Disputers of this World,</HI> have in all Ages disputed on that Obscure Problem, <HI>the Origin of Evil.</HI> And in the Enquiries after it, there have been those who have <HI>not enquired wisely concerning this matter.</HI> The Ancient Pagans had a Notion, which the <HI>Manabees</HI> afterwards licked up, of a <HI>Good GOD,</HI> who Created a <HI>Good World,</HI> and covered it with a Shell of His Pro¦tection; But then <HI>Another God</HI> who broke the Shell, and made all <HI>Evil</HI> to break in at the perforation. This Noti∣on prevailed very particularly with the <HI>Magians</HI> in <HI>Persia.</HI> But our Glorious
<PB N="8" REF="002250_0011_0FDADA1C14F41320"/>GOD, speaking of the <HI>Persian</HI> affairs takes Occasion to make this Challenge; Isai. XLV. 7. <HI>I form the Light, and I cre∣ate Darkness; I make Peace, and I create Evil; I the Lord do all these things.</HI> Man, if <HI>sad things</HI> involve thee in the <HI>Darkness</HI> of much <HI>Evil,</HI> Behold the Lord, who is the <HI>doer of all these things.</HI> The Univer∣sal, the Everlasting, the most Operative <HI>Providence</HI> of the Glorious GOD, is to be considered, as the <HI>Original</HI> of all the <HI>sad things</HI> that we meet withal. There is not an <HI>Atom</HI> in the World, about which the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD is unconcerned; Not an <HI>Atom</HI> so made <HI>in Vain,</HI> as to be left from under the Influence of that <HI>Omnipresent Providence,</HI> that <HI>Omnipotent Providence.</HI> Whatever comes to pass, we must evermore make that Confession; Psal. CXXXV. 6. <HI>Whatever the Lord plea∣sed, that has he done in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas, and in all deep Places.</HI> All things are disposed, all things are managed, by this Marvellous <HI>Providence;</HI> A <HI>Providence</HI> which does <HI>Marvellous things without Number:</HI> A <HI>Providence</HI> which watches over <HI>Insects</HI> as well as over <HI>Angels;</HI> Over the <HI>Worm</HI> as well as over his
<PB N="9" REF="002250_0012_0FDADA1E17DF4078"/>Brother <HI>Man</HI> who treads upon him; O∣ver the <HI>Stars</HI> of Heaven, and over the <HI>Stones</HI> of the Field. The very <HI>Sparrows</HI> are under the Divine <HI>Providence.</HI> Our SAVIOUR, who has now the Government of it, has told us; Matth. X. 29. <HI>One of them shall not fall to the ground, without your father.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Providence,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of it, that no <HI>little</HI> Thing, no, not the <HI>least</HI> in the World, is Exempted from it.</P>
<P>WE will Suppose the <HI>sad things</HI> that befal us, to appear never so much in the shape of meer <HI>Accidents;</HI> yet, GOD for∣bid, that we should come into the <HI>Phi∣listean</HI> Language, <HI>It was a chance that bap∣pened unto us.</HI> To tell of a <HI>Fortune;</HI> 'tis what becomes not the Mouth of a <HI>Christian.</HI> These <HI>Accidents,</HI> like the <HI>stor∣my Winds,</HI> do but <HI>Fulfil the Word of GOD.</HI> Yea, we will suppose <HI>Enemies,</HI> Rational and even Designing Agents, to bring our <HI>sad things</HI> upon us: But still these <HI>Ene∣mies</HI> are no other than <HI>Instruments.</HI> Ah, Thou Troubler; Thou art no more than the <HI>Axe</HI> or the <HI>Sarce;</HI> no more than the <HI>Rod</HI> or the <HI>Staff;</HI> without the Hand of our GOD, thou couldest never do any
<PB N="10" REF="002250_0013_0FDADA2000DA2F78"/>thing at all unto us. These are but <HI>Se∣cond Causes.</HI> When GOD <HI>gives Quietness who can cause Trouble!</HI> This then is the Upshot of the Matter. We are to Real∣ize the <HI>Providence</HI> of the Glorious GOD in all the <HI>sad things</HI> that we meet with∣al. Whenever any <HI>sad things</HI> befal us the very First Thought rising in our Minds must be this: <HI>Lord, Thou didst it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> There is a Providence of GOD in this thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The thing had never befallen me, if the Providence of GOD had not ordered it!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. AND now, for the <HI>Effect</HI> of the <HI>Maxim.</HI> What is that <HI>Holy Silence,</HI> which is to be maintained, when the Glorious GOD shall inflict <HI>sad things</HI> upon us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The Apprehension of our having to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a Glorious GOD, in the <HI>sad thing</HI> which we meet withal, must restrain all expressions of <HI>Impatience</HI> with us. Thus 'tis, that we are to <HI>hold our peace.</HI> The Thing which we are now asking after is this; what are those expressions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Impatience,</HI> which are to be refrained when there is danger lest our Spirits be∣come <HI>Impatient</HI> under <HI>sad Things</HI> be falling of us? Now,</P>
<P>First. THERE is an <HI>Holy silence</HI> with
<PB N="11" REF="002250_0014_0FDADA21236249E0"/>regard unto <HI>Men,</HI> to be maintained, when we are Concerned with <HI>Men,</HI> Injured by <HI>Men,</HI> in the <HI>sad Things</HI> which we meet withal. 'Tis indeed in such Cases, that we are apt most of all to fall into ex∣pressions of <HI>Impatience,</HI> and <HI>speak Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣visedly with our Lips:</HI> 'Tis when <HI>Men</HI> do Hurt us, Wrong us, Abuse us; when <HI>Men</HI> do such Things unto us as would even provoke a <HI>Stone</HI> to speak. Now in such Cases, what should be our <HI>Sen∣timents!</HI> Tho' it may be a <HI>Messenger from Satan</HI> that <HI>buffets</HI> us, yet Remem∣ber, there are <HI>Messages</HI> from GOD unto us in the <HI>Buffetings.</HI> And the <HI>Wards</HI> are best <HI>beard in Quietness.</HI> An <HI>Holy silence</HI> is needful, that we may listen to His <HI>Lessons.</HI> Under the <HI>sad things</HI> which we may suffer from <HI>Reproaches,</HI> we have been taught thus to think of a Calum∣nious Backbiter, 2 Sam. XVI. 11. <HI>The Lord hath bidden him.</HI> Yea, under <HI>sad things</HI> which we may suffer even from <HI>Robberries</HI> themselves, we must not for∣get, <HI>who gives us to the spoiler!</HI> We have been taught so to think; Job 1.21. <HI>The Lord hath taken away.</HI> Being thus aware of this, that if any <HI>Man</HI> be Abusive to
<PB N="12" REF="002250_0015_0FDADA2A31E10B00"/>us, 'tis GOD who <HI>stirs up the Adversary,</HI> let us go on to think; <HI>I have deserved from GOD, all the sad things which this Man does unto me: And if GOD thus bring me to Repentance, they are good things which are done unto me.</HI> Go on to think; <HI>My GOD would have me scoured by the Dirt cast upon me, and more shining in the Excellent Things that are most con∣trary to the approbrious Things, which are spoken of me: When works of Iniquities prevail against me, 'tis to purge away my Transgressions.</HI> Go on to think; <HI>My GOD will put me upon the Exercise of a Forgiving Spirit unto them who have of∣fended me, that so I may have the sweeter assurance of His having Forgiven all my Offences unto Him.</HI> Under the Impressi∣on of such Sonthments, Oh! Let an <HI>Ho∣ly silence,</HI> be now kept inviolable with you. Now for an Imitation of the <HI>meek and lowly JESUS;</HI> of Whom we read, Isai. LIII. 7. <HI>He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is Dumb, Yo He opened not His mouth:</HI> The <HI>meek and Lovely JESUS;</HI> of Whom we read,
<PB N="13" REF="002250_0016_0FDADA2C40053BD8"/>1 Pet. II. 23. <HI>When be was Reviled, He Reviled not again; when He suffered, He Threatned not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth Righteously.</HI> For be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all expressions of <HI>Impatience;</HI> all Ebulli∣tions of Intemperate <HI>Passion;</HI> Immode∣rate <HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on;</HI> all unseemly vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oler,</HI> and casting up of <HI>bitter G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Don't <HI>speak falsely,</HI> no, nor too <HI>Hardly</HI> and <HI>Harshly</HI> neither, of those that have wounded you. Let there come nothing from you that shall be <HI>outrageous,</HI> no∣thing that shall be <HI>revengf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Intention to <HI>Render Evil for Evils</HI> My Friend, <HI>Set a watch before thy Mouth, Keep the door of thy Lips.</HI> Be advised of this; To suffer many <HI>sad Things</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such as have been insufferably Abus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to us, but be after all able to say, <HI>Thro' the help of a dear SAVIOUR, there has not been all this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile so much at One Im∣patient Word Extorted from me!</HI> Verily. This were a Greater Favour of GOD, than there would have been in it, if the <HI>sad Things</HI> had never been met withal.</P>
<P>Secondly. THERE is an <HI>Holy silence</HI> with regard unto the Glorious GOD, much more to be maintained, when <HI>sad
<PB N="14" REF="002250_0017_0FDADA2D0CAA3000"/>Things</HI> are met withal. Being satisfied of this; <HI>Lord, Thou art the Doer of all!</HI> All Expressions of <HI>Impatience,</HI> are from this Moment forbidden unto us. Be sure we shall Express too much <HI>Impati∣ence,</HI> if our <HI>sad Things</HI> cause us to fall into <HI>Wishes</HI> to have our <HI>Death</HI> hastened upon us. A <HI>Job</HI> tired with <HI>sad Things,</HI> may cry out, <HI>O thus GOD would grant me the Thing that I long for! Even that it would please GOD to destroy me; that He would let loose His Hand, and cut me off!</HI> A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣red <HI>Elies</HI> may Wish, <HI>O Lord, Take away my Life!</HI> A tired <HI>Jonas</HI> may Wish, <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee, take my Life from me.</HI> But they <HI>spoke</HI> too much. It would have been better for them to have <HI>beld their Peace,</HI> been <HI>Dumb,</HI> and not so have <HI>opened their Mouths.</HI> Let all such Rash <HI>Wishes</HI> of a Soul <HI>out of Breath</HI> under the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads</HI> lying upon it, be Suppressed. There is a Faulty <HI>Impati∣ence</HI> in them. Nor is this all the Cau∣tion to be inculcated. The <HI>Holy silence</HI> must be yet further extended. It must lay a <HI>Restraint</HI> upon all the <HI>Complaints</HI> which may express any <HI>Impatience</HI> under the <HI>sad Things</HI> we meet withal. There
<PB N="15" REF="002250_0018_0FDADA2EA3B88800"/>must not pass from us, the least <HI>Whisper</HI> of any thing, that shall not breath a sweet <HI>Submission</HI> to, a sweet <HI>Acquiescence,</HI> in, the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD, sending <HI>sad Things</HI> upon us. Our <HI>Holy silence</HI> is to be kept in such Things as these.</P>
<P>First. NOTHING must be <HI>spoke Amiss</HI> concerning the Glorious GOD; Nothing <HI>spoke!</HI> No, Nothing so much as <HI>Thought amiss;</HI> under all the <HI>sad things</HI> which it shall please Him to lay upon us. This <HI>Holy silence</HI> must reach not only unto our <HI>Words,</HI> but also unto our very <HI>Thoughts.</HI> Our <HI>Thoughts</HI> may be as audible as the loudest cries in the <HI>Ears of the Lord of Hosts,</HI> who <HI>knows our Thoughts a far off.</HI> The <HI>Words</HI> of our very <HI>Minds,</HI> as well as of our <HI>Lips,</HI> under all our <HI>sad Things</HI> must be such, that this Report may be made of us; Job 1.22. <HI>In all this be sin∣ned not, nor charged GOD foolishly.</HI></P>
<P>MORE particularly,</P>
<P>First. ALL <HI>Impatient</HI> expressions of Re∣bellion against the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reignty</HI> of the Glorious GOD: These must be Restrain∣ed with an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> when a <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD shall do <HI>sad Things</HI> unto us. If <HI>sad Things</HI> be done unto us, we must by
<PB N="16" REF="002250_0019_0FDADA3007195E18"/>no means dispute the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the Glorious GOD over us; by no means dispute his <HI>Absolute Authority</HI> to do what He will with us, and <HI>give none ac∣count of His matters;</HI> by no means dis∣pute His <HI>Absolute Prerogative,</HI> to do <HI>what He will with His own.</HI> Let our <HI>sad Things</HI> but <HI>carry us down to the House of the Potter.</HI> Under our <HI>sad things,</HI> let us ly in the <HI>Dust</HI> before the Glorious GOD, and as <HI>Clay before the Potter,</HI> not go to <HI>strive with our Maker,</HI> if He break the <HI>Potsherds of the Earth</HI> to pieces at His Pleasure. With an <HI>Holy silence</HI> we must Subscribe to that; Job IX. 12. <HI>Behold, He taketh away; who can hinder Him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who will say unto Him, what doest thou?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. ALL <HI>Impatient</HI> expressions of Reflection upon the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Glorious GOD; These must be Re∣strained with an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> when a <HI>Righteous</HI> GOD shall do <HI>sad things</HI> unto us. When <HI>sad things</HI> are done unto us, We must not admit the least suspicion of any <HI>Injustice</HI> in the Dealings of Hea∣ven with us. Admit no suspicion, That we are <HI>unjustly</HI> dealt withal, or meet with hard measure, or are not indeed
<PB N="17" REF="002250_0020_0FDADA394F8A3DB0"/><HI>Punished less than our Sins deserve.</HI> Ad∣mit no suspicion, That we should be <HI>Unjustly</HI> dealt withal, if we were much more severely Punished, and visited with <HI>Great Plagues, and of a long conti∣nuance,</HI> yea, thrown into a <HI>Devouring Fire, and Everlasting Burnings.</HI> If we <HI>Groan</HI> under our <HI>sad things,</HI> yet, Oh! <HI>Grumble</HI> not! Our <HI>sad things</HI> would be no more than we are worthy of, if they were a Thousand times worse than they are. An <HI>Holy silence</HI> must be enjoin'd; with such a Reprimand as that; Lam. III. 39. <HI>Wherefore doth a living Man com∣plain, a Man for the Punishment of his Sins?</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. AN <HI>Holy silence</HI> must Re∣strain all <HI>Impatient</HI> Jealousies, about the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> and <HI>Compossion</HI> of a Glorious GOD; when <HI>sad things</HI> are done unto us. The Infliction of <HI>sad things</HI> upon us, will make a time of <HI>Temptations</HI> with us: <HI>Temptations</HI> to grow <HI>Jealous</HI> of what the Dispensations of GOD are tending to. 'Tis a <HI>Dark time</HI> and the <HI>Hour and Power of Darkness</HI> fall upon us. When the <HI>Night</HI> arrives, then the <HI>Lions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore.</HI> Our <HI>sad things</HI> bring <HI>Temptations</HI> with
<PB N="18" REF="002250_0021_0FDADA3AA8FCDFC8"/>them; <HI>Temptations</HI> to say, <HI>I shall one day perish by the hand of this Misery; 'twill be an undoing Misery. It will be too h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd for me! Temptations</HI> to say, <HI>GOD counts me for His Enemy; I now suffer from Him the strokes of an Enemy; 'tis n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my Sal∣vation, but my Destruction that is now to be looked for! Temptations</HI> to forget, that our <HI>sad things</HI> are all ordered by a SAVIOUR sitting on the Throne of GOD, and aiming at the <HI>Cure</HI> of all that is Ir∣regular in us, and at the Restoring of GOD unto His <HI>Throne</HI> in our Souls, and at the preparing of us for the <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly Places.</HI> If we are <HI>Tempted</HI> in and from our <HI>sad things</HI> to say, what will imply our Forgetting of such things as these, we ought now to <HI>silence</HI> these <HI>Jealousies.</HI> Instead of say∣ing as we are Tempted now to say, <HI>All these things are against me,</HI> let us with an <HI>Holy silence</HI> keep unto that Conclusi∣on; Gen. L. 20. <HI>GOD has meant it unto Good.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word; Under <HI>sad things</HI> befall∣ing us, there must be nothing heard from us, but the Language of PIETY; Nothing but what shall <HI>speak</HI> a Soul en∣tirely
<PB N="15" REF="002250_0022_0FDADA3C20382758"/>Swallowed up in the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD A Soul approving the <HI>equal Wayes</HI> of GOD in all that is done unto us; A Soul perswaded that our SAVIOUR has <HI>Thoughts of Peace, and not of Evil,</HI> in all that is done unto us.</P>
<P>BUT then, Secondly. A <HI>Shame</HI> of the <HI>Sin</HI> that has brought our <HI>sad things</HI> upon us; This belongs to that <HI>Holy silence,</HI> wherewith GOD is to be Glorified under them. The <HI>Confusion</HI> which <HI>Repentance</HI> is attended withal, it has an <HI>Holy silence</HI> in it. <HI>Repentance</HI> is thus described; Ezek. XVI. 63. <HI>That thou mayst Remem∣ber, and be Consounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy Shame.</HI> A true <HI>Penitent</HI> is thus exhibited unto us, Lam. III. 28, 29. <HI>He sitteth alone and keepeth silence; because he hath born it up∣on him; he putteth his mouth in the Dust.</HI> The frame of a true <HI>Peniten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is that; Ezra. IX. 6. <HI>O my God, I am ashamed. I blush to lift up my Face unto thee.</HI> And, <HI>I Blush to open my mouth before thee.</HI> Un∣der our <HI>sad things</HI> there is a <HI>Repentance</HI> called for; A <HI>Repentance</HI> that will <HI>not leave us a Word</HI> to say for our selves; but cast us into the Confusion of an <HI>Holy
<PB N="20" REF="002250_0023_0FDAC957D8F7E050"/>silence</HI> before the Glorious GOD, <HI>against whom we have sinned.</HI> The most agreea∣ble Voice of <HI>Lamentations</HI> is that, <HI>Let us search and try our Ways, and Return unto the Lord.</HI> But in this <HI>Return</HI> unto the Lord, there must be an <HI>Holy silence</HI> caused by the <HI>Confusion</HI> arising from what we find in our <HI>searching</HI> and our <HI>trying</HI> of our <HI>Ways.</HI> We are told, That if we would <HI>speak aright,</HI> we must say, <HI>What have I done?</HI> But then having so <HI>spoke aright,</HI> there must follow an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> from the <HI>shame</HI> of what we <HI>have done.</HI> If <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d things</HI> befall us, we are to-hear an Holy GOD saying unto us, <HI>Thy Way and thy Doings have procured those things unto thee; this is thy Wickedness.</HI> Under <HI>sad Things,</HI> let us Examine our selves, <HI>What have I done to procure these things? What Wickedness, either in point of Commission, or of Omission, have I been guilty of?</HI> Oh! Let us Loath and Judge our selves before the Glorious GOD, and with an <HI>Holy silence</HI> let us take to our selves the <HI>shame</HI> of our Miscarriages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which we have provoked His Majes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to inflict such <HI>sad Things</HI> upon us. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen <HI>sad Things</HI> befall us, we may say,
<PB N="21" REF="002250_0024_0FDADA4387759B60"/><HI>My GOD will Humble me.</HI> Under these <HI>Humbling things,</HI> it will become us to take a Catalogue of Things <HI>Required</HI> and <HI>Forbidden</HI> in the Commandments of our GOD. Examine the Trespasses, wherein we have <HI>Denied the GOD that is Above.</HI> With the deepest <HI>Humiliation</HI> Confess, <HI>Lord, I have nothing to say for my self I can make no Excuses for my Re∣bellions. Oh! I abhor my self, and I Re∣pent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> The <HI>Holy silence,</HI> which our <HI>sad things</HI> call us to, is that of a <HI>Mouth lying in the Dust.</HI> Of the poor Man Convicted of being in ill Terms with Heaven, we read, Match. XXII. 12. <HI>He was speechless.</HI> This we are now to be, upon the Conviction un∣der which we are to ly, with no other Moan but this, <HI>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. THERE is a <HI>Death</HI> to all things here below, in which we are to maintain that <HI>Holy silence</HI> that our <HI>sad things</HI> are to be born withal. Of the <HI>Dead,</HI> we read, They <HI>go down into silence.</HI> They that are gone down into the <HI>Grave</HI> where the <HI>Dead</HI> are lodged, are in the
<PB N="22" REF="002250_0025_0FDADA450C5A5698"/><HI>Place of silence;</HI> have it said of them, <HI>They are silent in the Grave.</HI> 'Tis a De∣scription of <HI>Death;</HI> Psal. XLIV. 17. <HI>A Soul dwelling in silence.</HI> Now, before we come to the <HI>Natural Death,</HI> which lies in the <HI>Destruction of the Commerce between the Heart and the Brain,</HI> there is a <HI>Moral Death,</HI> to be pursued and obtain∣ed; A <HI>Death</HI> upon our Vitious Appe∣tites; a <HI>Death</HI> wherein we shall have our <HI>Lusts Mortified;</HI> a <HI>Death</HI> in which we shall be <HI>Dead with CHRIST,</HI> and have nothing but a CHRIST left <HI>Alive</HI> unto us, in regard of any strong Relish in our Souls. To be <HI>Dead,</HI> is to be <HI>Dumb.</HI> The Errand of all our <HI>sad things</HI> that come upon us, to render us <HI>Dead</HI> unto all Things here. For just as far as we Dy to these things we <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD; It is the <HI>Dethroning</HI> of these Things, that Restores GOD unto His <HI>Throne</HI> in our Souls; and by <HI>This we Live; in this is the Life of our Spirit.</HI> Our Faithful SA∣VIOUR sends <HI>Killing things</HI> upon us; perhaps they are without a <HI>Metaphor</HI> so. He <HI>Loves</HI> us, when He <HI>Kills</HI> us. 'Tis that He may <HI>Kill</HI> our violent passi∣ons for <HI>Creatures,</HI> and that He may
<PB N="23" REF="002250_0026_0FDADA49A4FD19D8"/>Quicken and Compell in us the Disposi∣tions of a <HI>Soul Returning unto GOD;</HI> and that our Soul may be disposed, for the pursuit of that <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in GOD alone, which we vainly have expected from <HI>Creatures</HI> heretofore. Under our <HI>sad things</HI> there is to be endeavoured the <HI>Holy silence</HI> of those who are <HI>Crucified unto the World,</HI> and who have the <HI>World Crucified unto them.</HI> A Man hanging on a <HI>Cross;</HI> This Man, is <HI>Free among the Dead,</HI> and has <HI>little to say,</HI> unto any thing that <HI>this World</HI> has to offer unto him. Yea, <HI>this World,</HI> with all the <HI>En∣joyments</HI> of it, must be as a <HI>Crucified thing</HI> unto us; a <HI>Dead Carcase</HI> whereof we shall have <HI>little to say,</HI> expressive of any Value for it. Christians, Under the <HI>sad things</HI> that befall you, <HI>Die, Die,</HI> to the <HI>Comforts</HI> of this <HI>World.</HI> Let your <HI>Sentiments</HI> of them grow as cold as may be: And what are the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of the <HI>Dead</HI> concerning them. Yea, <HI>Die</HI> also to the <HI>Troubles</HI> of <HI>this World.</HI> I must complain of it, That many who seem to be pretty far gone in a <HI>Death</HI> to the <HI>Comforts of this World,</HI> are not got so far as they should be in a <HI>Death</HI> to the
<PB N="24" REF="002250_0027_0FDADA4E88DEEF60"/><HI>Troubles</HI> of <HI>this World.</HI> But, my Friends what are the <HI>Resentments</HI> of a <HI>Dead Man</HI> upon all the <HI>Hard things</HI> that may be spoke of him, or may be done to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He <HI>says nothing</HI> upon these things. Even such an <HI>Indifferency</HI> must be approach'd unto. Oh! Could our dear and kind SAVIOUR see us thus <HI>Dead,</HI> under all the <HI>sad things</HI> that He sends upon us! — I say unto you, He would <HI>shew won∣ders to the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have described unto you, the <HI>Holy silence,</HI> wherewith GOD is to be Glorified under all our <HI>sad things,</HI> which a Glorious GOD may send upon us.</P>
<P>BUT now at last, you shall have leave to <HI>break silence,</HI> and a leave to <HI>speak</HI> shall be allowed unto you. Tis now to be supposed, That you will <HI>speak</HI> nothing but what it will well become you to <HI>speak.</HI> And you shall have an <HI>Allowance,</HI> yea, a <HI>Direction</HI> to <HI>speak.</HI> Tho' an <HI>Holy Silence</HI> becomes you under your <HI>sad things,</HI> yet there is a <HI>sottish silence</HI> which is very misbecoming. There is a <HI>speaking,</HI> which will be very consistent with the <HI>Holy silence</HI> which under your <HI>sad things</HI> you are call'd unto. It was the Remark
<PB N="29" REF="002250_0028_0FDADA4FCDA08680"/>of the Psalmist; Psal. XXXIX. 2. <HI>With silence I remain'd as Dumb; I wholly held my peace; not mentioning of any Good; my grief was then renew'd.</HI> There are some <HI>Good things</HI> to be <HI>mentioned</HI> under our <HI>sad things.</HI> We must not now be so <HI>Dumb with silence</HI> as <HI>wholly</HI> to <HI>hold our Peace,</HI> and forbear the <HI>mention</HI> of those <HI>Good things.</HI> Our <HI>Grief</HI> will be <HI>Renew'd,</HI> Increas'd, Inflam'd, by such a <HI>silence.</HI> Yea, Because you are concerned with GOD, in all the <HI>sad things</HI> that you meet withal; For that very Cause, you are now to <HI>speak</HI> some Things which He will be pleased withal; <HI>speak</HI> such Things as may answer the Intention of His Dealings with you.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P>First. CHRISTIAN, since the Glorious GOD is the Doer of what is in any <HI>sad things</HI> done unto thee, be not so <HI>Dumb,</HI> do not so <HI>hold thy peace,</HI> as to have thy <HI>Mouth not open</HI> in the <HI>Voice of Supplicati∣on.</HI> 'Tis a Thing Enjoined and Expec∣ted by our GOD, when <HI>sad things</HI> are inflicted, Jam. V. 13. <HI>Is any among you Afflicted? Let him Pray.</HI> O thou <HI>Afflic∣ted,</HI> It will be no Trespass upon the
<PB N="26" REF="002250_0029_0FDADA5129EC1DE0"/>Rules of the <HI>Holy silence</HI> imposed on thee, under thy <HI>sad things,</HI> to <HI>speak</HI> and Pray, <HI>Lord, shew me wherefore thou con∣tendest with me. Speak</HI> and Pray, <HI>Lord, Let the things which for the present are not joyous but grievous, afterwards yield me the peaceable Fruits of Righte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness.</HI> Yea, since we have had that permission from our Gracious GOD, <HI>Call upon me in the day of Trouble, and I will Deliver thee;</HI> Even <HI>Lift up thy Voice</HI> for this also. <HI>Speak</HI> and Beg and Ask humbly for a seasona∣ble <HI>Deliverance.</HI> If no <HI>sad things</HI> will bring thee to the Use of thy <HI>Voice,</HI> but thou continue <HI>Prayerless</HI> under them; — <HI>All this come upon thee; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et thou bast not made thy Prayer unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord!</HI> — Alas this is not an <HI>Holy silence;</HI> No, 'Tis a <HI>Dumb Devil</HI> that seems to have his Operation in it.</P>
<P>Secondly. SINCE the Glorious GOD is the Doer, of what is in any <HI>sad things</HI> done unto thee, be not so <HI>Dumb,</HI> do not so <HI>hold thy peace,</HI> as to have thy <HI>Mouth not open</HI> in the <HI>Voice of Sacrifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing.</HI> In all thy <HI>sad things</HI> GOD puts thee upon parting with some Enjoyments. Now, for the Voice of a <HI>Sacrificer!</HI> Now say
<PB N="27" REF="002250_0030_0FDADA5676624978"/>with him, Jon. II. 9. <HI>I will Sacrifice unto thee, with a Voice.</HI> All the <HI>sweet things,</HI> which thou b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st lost, in and by the <HI>sad things</HI> that are come upon thee; use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Holy silence,</HI> as to any Remonstrances against the proceedings of GOD in depriving thee of them. <HI>Sacrifices</HI> use to be carri∣ed on <HI>silently.</HI> Instead there of <HI>speak,</HI> and say, <HI>Lord, I Resign; Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I Submit; Lord, I Offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up unto Thee, whatever thou wilt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ase to call for; I Forego, whatever thou wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have to be denied unto me!</HI> Come, Initiate thy self at the <HI>Royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> Upon all thy <HI>sad things</HI> use the Language of a Noble <HI>Sacrificer.</HI> Hea∣ven hears not a more <HI>grateful, Melody!</HI> If a <HI>Priest</HI> be struck <HI>Dumb,</HI> his <HI>Priesthood</HI> won't be well carried on. The Displea∣sure of GOD seems to set a <HI>Mark</HI> upon h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</P>
<P>Lastly, IT will be very consistent with an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> under thy <HI>sad things</HI> to <HI>speak</HI> still at that rate; Psal. XLII. 8. <HI>In the Night. His Song was with me.</HI> My Brethren, there are <HI>Songs</HI> which <HI>GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Maker gives</HI> unto us, <HI>for the Night,</HI> which your <HI>sad things,</HI> bring upon us. To intermit those Lovely <HI>Songs,</HI> will be no
<PB N="28" REF="002250_0031_0FDADA5AA3631118"/><HI>Holy silence.</HI> One of the <HI>songs</HI> I will now utter in your Hearing. <HI>Whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad things befall me, I have a Glorious CHRIST left still unto me! A CHRIST who Reconciles me unto GOD, who pleads the Causes of my Soul; who undertakes to heal all that's amiss in me; who orders my whole Condition for me; who will make all things work together for my Good; who will carry me well thro' the Valley of the shadow of Death; who will bring me to all the Spiritual Blessings of the Heavenly Pla∣ces; And while I have such a CHRIST concerned for me, Happy, Happy am I; I never can be miserable!</HI> Go on, O Suffer∣ing Believer, and Soar, and Sing at this rate; <HI>Whatever sad things befall me, while I feel a Glorious CHRIST Possessing of me, and Conversing with me, and I can by the precious Thoughts of Him have a CHRIST always Dwelling in me; and I can find in a CHRIST all that was Amia∣ble and Valuable in the Creatures that are taken from me; so long I cannot but be Comfortable. In all my Darkness, I have a wondrous Light arising to me.</HI> O Be∣lieving Sufferer, While thy <HI>sad things</HI> thus drive thee as a <HI>Dove</HI> to the <HI>Clef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="29" REF="002250_0032_0FDADA5B895D08A0"/>of the Rock,</HI> thy SAVIOUR says, <HI>Let me hear thy Voice!</HI> And <HI>sweet, sweet</HI> will be this <HI>Voice</HI> of thine unto Him.</P>
<P>THE PIETY of an <HI>Holy silence,</HI> yet <HI>speaking</HI> such things as these, is to be particularly Exemplified, on the Sorrow∣ful Occasions, when like <HI>Aaron</HI> the <HI>Priest of the Lord,</HI> we have our CHILDREN taken from us; the <HI>Desire of our Eyes taken away with a stroke.</HI> Such Occasi∣ons do now exceedingly multiply, in a <HI>City, the cry whereof goes up to Heaven.</HI> My Brethren, Allow me to tell you, That on such Occasions; tho' we are to <HI>hold our peace,</HI> yet we are to <HI>make men∣tion of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>not keep silence,</HI> as to the <HI>satisfaction,</HI> which we find <HI>Him</HI> afford unto us.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Affection</HI> to our <HI>Children</HI> makes us desirous to have them <HI>Live,</HI> that they may taste the <HI>Comforts</HI> of <HI>this Life,</HI> and those Good Things, which we would as far as we can help them to. But now, <HI>speak</HI> such a thing as this. <HI>A Glo∣rious CHRIST fetches away these Children to a World, where they are feasted with Comforts, which this mean and vain World could never yield unto them. They are
<PB N="30" REF="002250_0033_0FDADA5D26BACF68"/>Comforted in the Paradise which they are gone unto.</HI></P>
<P>WE have seen <HI>Lovely Qualities</HI> in our <HI>Children,</HI> by which they have been mightily Endeared unto us. But now, <HI>speak</HI> such a thing as this. <HI>There could be no Beauty in our Children but what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may see to Endear a Glorious CHRIST in∣finitely more unto us: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Altogether Lovely One! Thou didst give all that was Beauti∣ful in them; and thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so made them a thousand times more Beautiful than they were before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Delight we have taken in <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with our <HI>Children,</HI> makes us wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to have them with us. But now, <HI>spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> such a Thing as this. <HI>In Communion with a Glorious CHRIST, I can find such things to delight my Soul, as the most plea∣sant Children upon Earth could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enrich me with.</HI></P>
<P>Having <HI>spoken</HI> such agreeable Things, now, Syr, 'tis time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>hold your peace.</HI></P>
<P>¶. IT becomes <HI>me</HI> to do so, who have this Day, a DAUGHTER, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together with <HI>her</HI> New born <HI>Daught<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> waiting to be <HI>Buried out of my Sight,</HI> whom o∣thers
<PB N="31" REF="002250_0034_0FDADA6080071480"/>as well as I, could not but always with much Affection <HI>Look</HI> upon.</P>
<P>IF I should <HI>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak</HI> of the Singular Good∣ness and Sweetness in her Temper, which rendred her <HI>Universally Beloved,</HI> or of that <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Piety,</HI> which most of all bespoke, I will not say, the <HI>Praises</HI> for <HI>her</HI> which belong to the <HI>Woman that fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord,</HI> but the <HI>Praises of Him who called her out of Darkness into His Mar∣vellous Light:</HI> I might fall into the <HI>In∣decency</HI> of <HI>speaking,</HI> what might be more properly published by another.</P>
<P>IT will be no <HI>Tresp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> upon the <HI>silence</HI> proper for me, to <HI>mention</HI> a Circum∣stance of her <HI>Death,</HI> which may serve the Cause of that <HI>Early Piety,</HI> that she was an Instance of.</P>
<P>SHE Entertained the Approaches of her Death, with a most humble <HI>Resigna∣tion</HI> to the <HI>Will</HI> of her Glorious LORD, and <HI>Acquiescence</HI> in it: Tho' not with∣out the Remainders of that <HI>Fear,</HI> that, she said, had <HI>all her Life held her in Bon∣dage.</HI></P>
<P>SHE had not the Raptures of a <HI>Joyful Assurance,</HI> which some that had been once Related to her, Enjoy'd in their

Tho' she said, <HI>That in the Religion of the Closet, she had found the Spirit of GOD making His Gracious Visits to her Soul, with some Com∣fortable Assurances of His Love;</HI> Yet she said, That she was not now without some <HI>Distress</HI> upon her Mind; complain∣ing, that the Affairs of <HI>this World</HI> had so Enfeebled her <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> as to impair the <HI>Light of His Countenance</HI> up∣on her. But still she kept in the strains and at the Acts, of that <HI>Substantial</HI> PIE∣TY, which lies in Soul a <HI>groaning</HI> after a Deliverance from <HI>Indwelling Sin,</HI> and <HI>Longing</HI> after a <HI>Conformity</HI> to GOD, and laying hold on a SAVIOUR, to <HI>fulfil all the Good Pleasure of His Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING Renewed the <HI>Consent</HI> of her Soul, over and over again, unto the Gra∣cious proposal made by her SAVIOUR, for her <HI>Espousal</HI> to Him; and being ask∣ed, whether she desired that her SAVI∣OUR would make her <HI>Holy</HI> as well as <HI>Righteous,</HI> and so fill her Soul with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, that GOD should be for∣ever Dwelling and Reigning there, she did with a Raised, and a more than common Ardor, make this Answer to it;
<PB N="33" REF="002250_0036_0FDADA6492EA7010"/><HI>Oh! more than Life it self! That Favour of GOD is better than Life!</HI></P>
<P>AS her End approached, she had her <HI>Good Hope thro' Grace</HI> growing upon her. And the very last Thing she spoke to me, was with Repetition to assure me, <HI>That her SAVIOUR had given her a Com∣fortable perswasion of His Receiving her to the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>BUT she left with me her Desires, That I would go on to inculcate upon the <HI>Young People</HI> in the Place, that <HI>Early Piety,</HI> wherein (as All, and even the most Watchful and Fruitful Children of GOD always declare, when they come to dye) her <HI>poor Endeavours to Walk with GOD,</HI> she said, had <HI>Nothing in them to be Repented of,</HI> but that they had been so <HI>poor,</HI> and that she had no more aboun∣ded in them.</P>
<P>SHE was Born, June 14. 1694. But when she takes her Flight, she leaves yet Surviving, Two GRAND-FATHERS; the Venerable Dr. INCREASEMATHER, in the Eighty Third, and the Honoura∣ble Col. JOHN PHILIPS, in the Nine∣tieth, Year of their Age; Longing for their Orders to come away unto that

<P>HAVING Related thus much, and so far discharged my Duty, I shall now <HI>hold my Peace,</HI> which is the Duty now remaining for me.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> Course, the <HI>Only</HI> Course! It was well done, O <HI>Servant of the Lord:</HI> Whither, whither else couldest thou have gone for <HI>Help?</HI> Where else could∣est thou have applied thy self with any comfortable Expectation? An <HI>Imitation</HI> of this Holy Example, is the Thing I have to propose unto my Hearers. In such an <HI>Evil World</HI> as this <HI>present World,</HI> we cannot be without frequent and ma∣ny
<PB N="2" REF="002250_0039_0FDADA6D8B49D8C8"/>Occasions. But at this <HI>Evil Time,</HI> the Occasions multiply exceedingly. <HI>Lord, How are the Things increased which trouble us!</HI> Many, many are the <HI>Loads</HI> that we feel <HI>Oppressing</HI> of us. The <HI>Wounds</HI> given to many, in the <HI>Deaths</HI> which take away the <HI>Desire</HI> of <HI>their Eyes</HI> with a Tragical <HI>Stroke;</HI> And the <HI>Weary Nights</HI> that are appointed for many more in the Condition of our Families; These are some of the many Things, that cause us to groan, <HI>Lord, I am Oppres∣sed under what is done unto me.</HI> How of∣ten are we <HI>distressed,</HI> until we even <HI>Cry out of our Oppression?</HI> Whither shall we Look in our Distresses, but unto Him a∣lone, who can Support and Rescue us? <HI>Lord, whither shall we go from thee! Thou hast the Words of all our Help!</HI></P>
<P>THAT Religious and Renowned Prince <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was visited with a terrible <HI>Sickness.</HI> I know not, whether it was in the Time, while <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was actu∣ally besieged by <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> or whether it was after the miraculous Raising of the Siege, by the <HI>Angels,</HI> and the <HI>Thun∣ders</HI> of Heaven. If this Calamity befel him after his remarkable <HI>Deliverance</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002250_0040_0FDADA724C4F8CE0"/>from his Adversary, it was, as <HI>Jerom</HI> notes, To Chasten him, left his Heart should be listed up, too far, <HI>post incredi∣biles triumphos et de media Captivitate Vic∣teriam.</HI> Let it be how it will, after his <HI>Deliverance</HI> from that <HI>Calamity,</HI> he com∣poses an admirable <HI>Song,</HI> which expres∣ses his Dispositions and Circmstances, while it was yet upon him. In this ve∣ry thing, there is a pattern given to all Good Men, that have endured <HI>Great Af∣flictions,</HI> and Received <HI>Great Salvations.</HI> O <HI>ye Men of Great Experiences,</HI> You ought to Commemorate what you have Experienced; you ought to prepare and preserve <HI>Memerials</HI> of what you have met withal; you should at least leave these <HI>Memerials</HI> with your own <HI>Families,</HI> that they may learn to <HI>place their Hope in GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I dismiss that Admonition; and pro∣ceed unto One Article of this Excellent Mans <HI>Behaviour</HI> in the Time of his <HI>Cala∣mity.</HI> This was, an Earnest <HI>Supplication</HI> unto GOD. We have Two things before us. First; We have his <HI>Condition, O Lord, I am oppressed.</HI> The Word proper∣ly means, an <HI>unjust Hardship,</HI> wherein,
<PB N="4" REF="002250_0041_0FDADA73C806C388"/>as we say, <HI>Might overcomes Right!</HI> But we must not imagine, That our Saint would cry out as one in that sense <HI>Op∣pressed</HI> by GOD. The Word then is to be taken in the <HI>Improper</HI> meaning; It is as much as to say, <Q>My <HI>Affliction</HI> is <HI>too heavy</HI> for me; and my Distemper han∣dles me with a sort of <HI>Tyranny:</HI> I am <HI>overthrown,</HI> I am <HI>overwhelmed,</HI> I have no way to help my self.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly, WE have his <HI>Petition, Un∣dertake for me.</HI> The word signifies, To <HI>mingle.</HI> It leads us to a <HI>Suretiship,</HI> in which Parties are <HI>mingled;</HI> the one acts for the other, yea, the one becomes the other. It is, q. d. Engage for my Help. It also signifies <HI>Comfort</HI> me; <HI>Refresh</HI> me, <HI>Ease</HI> me, give me some <HI>Rest.</HI> Some In∣terpreters translate the Word, <HI>Weave me up.</HI> He had just before said, <HI>I have cut off like a weaver my Life.</HI> Now he says; Extend the <HI>Web of my Life;</HI> Let it not be <HI>cut off,</HI> till it be fairly and fully finished.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE before us, what else can it well be, but this?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002250_0042_0FDADA75E0314D70"/>
<HI>GOOD Men Distressed &amp; even Oppressed with Affliction, may and should go to GOD, and cry to Him, who is the Hel∣per of the Oppressed, that He will un∣dertake for them.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER all <HI>press<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> our Course must be to Fly unto GOD, as our <HI>Undertaker;</HI> Make our Prayer to GOD, that He will <HI>Undertake</HI> to relieve us in, and redeem us from all the <HI>Op∣pression</HI> that is upon us. I am to speak some <HI>Good Words</HI> this Day; <HI>Words</HI> by which may be <HI>made Glad, the Hearts that are stouping with Heaviness.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. SOMETIMES we are so <HI>Distressed,</HI> as even to be <HI>oppressed</HI> in it. Our <HI>Affliction</HI> may be such, that we may call it, an <HI>Oppression</HI> too. We may be so <HI>Afflicted,</HI> that we may have cause to cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am Oppressed,</HI></P>
<P>BUT what sort of <HI>Distresses,</HI> are they that may be styled <HI>Oppressions.</HI> Why;</P>
<P>First. <HI>ALL Distresses,</HI> that <HI>lye very heavy</HI> upon us, may be counted <HI>Oppressi∣ons.</HI> When an Affliction <HI>Sinks</HI> us, then there is a kind of an <HI>Oppression</HI> in it. If an Affliction be such a <HI>Burden</HI> upon our Spirits, or upon our Interests, that we
<PB N="6" REF="002250_0043_0FDADA77920BB488"/>can't <HI>easily subsist</HI> under it, we may now cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am Oppressed!</HI> He was an oppressed man, who could say, Psal. CXIX. 107. <HI>I am afflicted very much.</HI> Sometimes an <HI>Affliction</HI> befalls us, that has in it <HI>more than ordinary</HI> matter of <HI>Sorrow;</HI> that Sorrow, by which our <HI>Hearts are broken</HI> within us. And some∣times we labour under a <HI>variety</HI> of <HI>Affliction: Many</HI> vexations, and confusi∣ons do at once break in upon us. We <HI>faint,</HI> we <HI>fail,</HI> we can't keep up a com∣fortable Temper. Then we may say, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed.</HI> So might he, that could say, Psal. LXXXVIII. 7. <HI>Thy wrath lies hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves.</HI> So might he that could say, Psal. XXXVIII. 2. <HI>Thy Arrows stick fast in me, and thy Hand pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses me sore.</HI> Consult the <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> of Afflicted <HI>Job;</HI> In them you often have a Para∣phrase on our, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed.</HI> It is Paraphrased, when he says, <HI>Oh! That my Grief were thoroughly weighed! For now, it would be heavier than the sand of the Sea: Therefore my words are swallowed up.</HI> There may be <HI>Oppression</HI> in our <HI>Affliction,</HI> without any of the least
<PB N="7" REF="002250_0044_0FDADA7BF3066C78"/><HI>Injustice</HI> in it. It is enough, if there be <HI>Extremity</HI> in it, if there be <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crity</HI> in it, if it be <HI>Insupportable;</HI> if we cannot well encounter it. We may now say, <HI>O Lord, I am Oppressed.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, Secondly; There are those which are <HI>Oppressions</HI> without a Figure; <HI>Oppressions</HI> in the strict import of the Term; And these are <HI>Oppressions</HI> that have <HI>Injustice</HI> in them. We are <HI>Oppressed,</HI> when we are <HI>unjustly</HI> and <HI>unfairly</HI> dealt withal. The <HI>Injured</HI> are the <HI>Oppressed.</HI> There is that which is called, Psal. CXIX. 134. <HI>The Oppression of Man.</HI> This Oppression always carries <HI>Injustice</HI> in it. There is the <HI>Gain of Oppression.</HI> There is a <HI>Leviathan,</HI> who is eminently esteemed, <HI>The Oppressor.</HI> 'Tis the Man who uses <HI>Extortion</HI> in his Dealings; the Man, who takes <HI>Advantage</HI> upon the Ne∣cessities of other Men, to compell them unto unconscionable Difficulties; the Man, who detains the <HI>hire of the Labour∣ers,</HI> and the <HI>Just Dues</HI> of the Necessitous, till they make a <HI>Cry.</HI> We read of such an one, Hos. XII. 7. <HI>He Loves to Oppress.</HI> There are <HI>Oppressions</HI> in all <HI>Cruel</HI> Usages. Every <HI>Cruelty,</HI> tho' to the most abject of
<PB REF="002250_0045_0FDADA7D8DD394D0"/>Creatures, is an <HI>Oppression.</HI> A <HI>Slave</HI> bar∣barously dealt withal, may say, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed.</HI> They also that are <HI>Abused,</HI> and <HI>Sandered,</HI> in their Names, and un∣justly Reproached; these may say, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed. Unjust Representa∣tions</HI> made of Men, are <HI>Oppressions</HI> upon them. A Man, who is treated as an <HI>Offender,</HI> when it may truly be said, <HI>This man has done nothing amiss!</HI> This man may say, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed.</HI> When Affront, Contempt, <HI>Indignity</HI> is cast upon a Man, who deserves another man∣ner of Treatment, he is an <HI>oppressed</HI> man. And if the man who is <HI>unrighteously dealt</HI> withal, be basely deserted, by those that ought to appear for his defence and ser∣vice; If he be deprived of <HI>Remedies</HI> to defend himself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>oppression</HI> then be∣comes yet more notorious &amp; conspicuous. <HI>God will look upon it!</HI> But that I am to tell you, in the Second <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Oppressed,</HI> What shall they <HI>do?</HI> Where shall they <HI>go?</HI> But make their <HI>Complaint unto the Lord;</HI> Sollicit the Lord, that He would <HI>undertake</HI> for them. So we are taught, by Psal. CII.
<PB N="9" REF="002250_0046_0FDADA81E54273C0"/>Fit. <HI>A Prayer of the Afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and pour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th out his complaint before the Lord.</HI> Several things are now to be Enquired.</P>
<P>WE will Enquire, First; HOW the <HI>Oppressed</HI> must make their <HI>Complaint unto the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>WE will Answer; First; Be sure, You may not complain of any <HI>Oppression in the Lord.</HI> Of the Glorious Lord, that Acknowledgment must be Eternally made, Psal. XCII. 15. <HI>There is no unrigh∣teousness in Him.</HI> Whatever <HI>Distresses</HI> come upon us, we must Acknowledge; <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord is Holy in all his ways, and Righteous in all his Works.</HI> Whatever may be our <HI>Afflictions,</HI> we must Acknow∣ledge, <HI>Lord, Thou dost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unish me far less than mine Iniquities deserve.</HI> Indeed, One that was under a vast confluence, and contrition of <HI>Troubles,</HI> broke forth into that Expression; Job X. 3. <HI>Is it Good unto thee, that thou shouldest oppress?</HI> But the Good GOD may truly say; <HI>I cannot oppress.</HI> Oh! Let us humble our selves before the awful, absolute, infinite <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the Great GOD. The <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD may <HI>de what. He will,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002250_0047_0FDADA8356FF5FF8"/>with all the Works of His Hands. 'Tis no Oppression in the <HI>Potter,</HI> to do what He will with the <HI>Clay.</HI> The Great GOD would not <HI>oppress</HI> us, tho' He should ut∣terly <HI>Destroy</HI> us; and; <HI>unto whom shall He give an Account of His matters?</HI> But then, Let us add the Consideration of our own exceeding <HI>Sinfulness:</HI> Consider, how much we have by our <HI>Sins,</HI> made our selves worthy of the forest Plagues; Consider that Expostulation; Lam. III. 39. <HI>Why should a living Man complain; a Man for the Punishment of his Sin?</HI> After this, when we <HI>complain to</HI> the Lord, O <HI>Lord, I am oppressed;</HI> Yet never <HI>Complain of</HI> the Lord. Confess before the Lord, <Q>O Lord, If my <HI>Distresses</HI> and <HI>Afflictions</HI> do <HI>oppress</HI> me, yet thou art not char∣geable with any <HI>Oppression.</HI> Thou art <HI>Just, in all that is come upon me.</HI> Tho' Man may use <HI>Injustice</HI> towards me, there is not the least <HI>Injustice,</HI> in the Lord, who has ordered all.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. YOUR <HI>Complaint</HI> unto the Lord, under your <HI>Oppression,</HI> must be your <HI>Pray∣er</HI> to the Lord, that He would <HI>undertake</HI> for you. It must be an Address to the Lord, that you may be help't under
<PB N="11" REF="002250_0048_0FDADA854BF6F530"/>your <HI>Oppression,</HI> by His <HI>undertaking</HI> for you.</P>
<P>BUT what is contained, in this Com∣prehensive Desire, <HI>Undertake for me.</HI> It contains in General, a Desire, that GOD would <HI>go thorough</HI> with all that shall be∣needful for our Succour. He that <HI>un∣dertakes</HI> a Business, must <HI>perform</HI> it, and <HI>go thorough</HI> with it. Now there are se∣veral things needful to be <HI>performed</HI> for the <HI>oppressed</HI> People of GOD.</P>
<P>First. MAY GOD <HI>Undertake</HI> for us, That we may be <HI>strengthened</HI> and <HI>comfort∣ed</HI> under our <HI>Oppressions.</HI> If GOD un∣dertake for us, we shall have the <HI>Assis∣tance</HI> of God; God will assist us to bear our <HI>Oppressions</HI> with <HI>Patience.</HI> If God <HI>undertake</HI> for us, we shall <HI>Continue</HI> and <HI>Persevere</HI> in the <HI>Wayes</HI> of God under our <HI>Oppressions,</HI> and not step aside into any Sin, tho' we are <HI>broken in the Place of Dragons.</HI> If God <HI>undertake</HI> for us, we shall be kept from Heart-breaking <HI>Des∣pondencies</HI> under our <HI>Oppressions;</HI> our Hearts will be revived with the <HI>Great Consolations of God</HI> brought home unto them. We read, Psal. LV. 22. <HI>He shall sustain thee.</HI> When we pray, <HI>Lord, un∣dertake
<PB N="12" REF="002250_0049_0FDADA866F3EA290"/>for me,</HI> we are to present such desires as these before the Lord: <Q><HI>Lord,</HI> Let none of my <HI>Distresses</HI> be too hard for me. If I must be <HI>Distressed,</HI> yet let me not be <HI>Forsaken.</HI> Do not suffer me to be <HI>Tempted above what thou wilt make me able to bear.</HI> Visit me with thy <HI>Spi∣rit;</HI> let thy Spirit <HI>visit</HI> me with thy <HI>Promises</HI> under my <HI>Distresses. O streng∣then me, and Comfort me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Secondly. MAY GOD <HI>undertake</HI> for us, That we may <HI>get Good</HI> by our <HI>Op∣pressions.</HI> If God <HI>undertake</HI> for us, our <HI>Oppressions</HI> will be made <HI>Beneficial,</HI> Ad∣vantageous, and Serviceable unto us; and we shall reap out of them the best of <HI>Benefits.</HI> If God <HI>undertake</HI> for us, our <HI>Oppressions</HI> will bring us <HI>nearer</HI> to God, and make us <HI>liker</HI> to Christ, and the Things which <HI>press</HI> us down, will but <HI>Raise</HI> us up to the most Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly elevations. It GOD <HI>undertake</HI> for us, our Souls will thrive under our <HI>Oppres∣sions,</HI> more than the <HI>Israelites</HI> did under their <HI>Egyptian</HI> ones; we shall be gainers by our Losses. We read, Heb. XII. 11. <HI>The chastning afterwards yields the peacea∣ble Fruit of Righteousness.</HI> When we
<PB N="13" REF="002250_0050_0FDADA87CE229760"/>pray, <HI>Lord, undertake for me,</HI> we are to present such Desires as these before the Lord: <Q><HI>Lord,</HI> Let my <HI>Distresses</HI> prove <HI>Kindnesses</HI> to me. Let me find that thou hast in <HI>Faithfulness</HI> distressed me; and that <HI>all the Fruit shall be to take a∣way my Sin.</HI> Let me be made <HI>better,</HI> by all the <HI>Evil</HI> that befals me; and let me be made <HI>Wiser</HI> by the <HI>Rod</HI> of thy Correction.</Q></P>
<P>Thirdly. MAY GOD <HI>undertake</HI> for us, That we may be <HI>Sav'd out</HI> of our <HI>Op∣pressions.</HI> The Great GOD, is the <HI>GOD of Salvations.</HI> If once He <HI>undertake</HI> for us, we shall have <HI>Salvations</HI> from our <HI>Oppressions.</HI> The cry of the <HI>oppressed</HI> is, <HI>Arise and save us.</HI> We read, Psal. CVII. 6. <HI>They cryed unto the Lord, in their Trou∣ble, and He delivered them out of their Distresses.</HI> When we pray, <HI>Lord, under∣take for me,</HI> we present these desires be∣fore the Lord; <Q><HI>Lord, Bring</HI> me out of my <HI>Distr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses.</HI> Let me see thy <HI>Salvati∣ons. I am Thine, Save me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS is what we have to do. But now,</P>
<P>WE will Enquire, Secondly. <HI>Why</HI> the
<PB N="14" REF="002250_0051_0FDADA8CAD564708"/><HI>oppressed</HI> should thus make their Com∣plaint unto the Lord.</P>
<P>WE will Answer. It should be done for these Reasons.</P>
<P>First. THERE is the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD, in all our <HI>Oppressions.</HI> It is the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD, that lays them on. Tho' the Blessed GOD can be no <HI>Oppressor;</HI> yet we can suffer no <HI>Oppressions</HI> without the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD. All our <HI>Afflictions</HI> are or∣dered by GOD. It was a word spoken once to one, who cryed out, <HI>I am Oppres∣sed;</HI> Job. V. 6, 8. <HI>Affliction comes not forth of the Dust, neither does Trouble spring out of the Ground; I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause.</HI> Whatever <HI>Distresses</HI> may Afflict us, and <HI>Oppress</HI> us, 'tis the unexceptionable <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI> of GOD, that has brought them upon us. If it be the <HI>Oppression of Man,</HI> that is grievous unto us, even this also is not without the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD. No Man can wrong us, but it may be said, <HI>God has bidden him.</HI> We read, Job. XXXIV. 29. <HI>When He giveth Quiet∣ness who can make Trouble?</HI> Well then; Since we have to do with GOD, in all our <HI>Oppressions,</HI> what shall we do, but
<PB N="15" REF="002250_0052_0FDADA8DCD3FC8E0"/>make our <HI>Complaint</HI> unto GOD? Yea, GOD sends our <HI>Oppressions</HI> upon us, on purpose to provoke and produce our <HI>Complaint</HI> unto <HI>Him.</HI> He says, <HI>In their Affliction, surely they will seek me Early.</HI> The <HI>same Hand</HI> that lays our <HI>Oppressions</HI> upon us; whither shall we look but unto <HI>that Hand,</HI> either to moderate them to us, or to deliver us from them?</P>
<P>Secondly. THE Faithful GOD is <HI>Engag'd</HI> for our Help in all our <HI>Oppressions.</HI> The very <HI>Nature</HI> of GOD, this is full of <HI>Mercy,</HI> full of <HI>Pity.</HI> There is in the very <HI>Nature</HI> of GOD, a Compassion for the Oppressed. We read, Lam. III. 32. <HI>Tho' He cause grief, yet will be have compossion, according to the Multitude of His Mercies.</HI> Hence it comes to pass, that when <HI>Sinful</HI> Men have brought sad <HI>Oppressions</HI> and Confusions on themselves by their <HI>Sins,</HI> yet if they make their <HI>Complaint</HI> unto the Lord, He soon says, <HI>Tho' I have brought such things upon them, yet I earnestly remember them still, and I will surely have mercy on them.</HI> 'Tis therefore also one of the <HI>Titles,</HI> by which the Lord has made Himself known unto us; Psal. IX. 9. <HI>The Lord will be a Refuge
<PB N="16" REF="002250_0053_0FDADA8F7A077FD0"/>for the oppressed.</HI> And, Psal. X. 18. <HI>He will judge the oppressed.</HI> Yea, And there is the <HI>Promise</HI> of GOD for it. GOD has <HI>Promised,</HI> That when the <HI>Oppressed</HI> bring their complaint unto Him, they shall not seek His Face in vain. Thus we read; Psal. XII. 5. <HI>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord. Oppressed Believer,</HI> why art thou <HI>cast down?</HI> why is thy <HI>Soul disquieted</HI> within thee? Go tell the Lord, all that lies as a <HI>Distress</HI> upon thee; Thou wilt find him ready to take notice of thy <HI>Distress,</HI> ready to do thee Good.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>NONE</HI> but GOD <HI>can help</HI> us in all our <HI>Oppressions.</HI> We read, Jer. III. 23. <HI>In vain is salvation expected else∣where; Truly in the Lord our GOD is the salvation of Israel.</HI> It is <HI>in vain</HI> to ask, any one else but the Lord only to <HI>Under∣take</HI> for us. If <HI>Creatures</HI> do <HI>undertake</HI> any thing for us, without GOD they can <HI>Accomplish</HI> nothing for us. They are all Physicians of no value. We read, Job XXI. 4. <HI>As for me, is my Complaint unto man? If it were so — 'Tis in vain</HI> for us to call, <HI>O Friend, undertake for
<PB N="17" REF="002250_0054_0FDADA90CA222978"/>me.</HI> We have no way left, but to call, <HI>O Lord, undertake for me.</HI> All other <HI>Undertakers</HI> will be <HI>miserable Comforters.</HI> They will effectually put us off, as the King did the poor <HI>Oppressed</HI> Woman; <HI>If the Lord help thee not, whence can I help thee!</HI> GOD is the only <HI>Refuge of the Oppressed.</HI> When any <HI>Oppression</HI> is upon us, we must make that Conclusion; <Q><HI>My Soul, wait thou only upon GOD; for my expectation is from Him alone. He only is my Rock and my Salvation.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, What are your <HI>Oppressions,</HI> what are your Exercises, <HI>O ye People, every one of you?</HI> Behold, a Lovely, the only <HI>Method of Relief!</HI> Oh! Let all <HI>Oppressed</HI> People, repair to the Glorious GOD, as their Great <HI>Undertaker.</HI> Make your Complaint, and your Prayer unto GOD, that He would <HI>Undertake</HI> for you. Where else will you go? <HI>What can ye do without me, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th the Lord!</HI> If your <HI>vain Imaginations</HI> propose this way, and that way; and indeed Fallen man hath <HI>sought out many Inventions;</HI> There are
<PB N="18" REF="002250_0055_0FDADA95D5E77F88"/>many <HI>ways</HI> to get off the <HI>heavy Burdens,</HI> which we feel <HI>Oppressing</HI> of us; <HI>Behold, I show unto you, a more excellent way.</HI> Spread before the Lord, all the <HI>Oppressi∣ons,</HI> and all the <HI>Distresses,</HI> that encumber you. Cry unto Him, <HI>O Lord, I am op∣pressed, Undertake for me!</HI> This is the way to come at that Happiness; Isai. LIV. 14. <HI>Thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear it.</HI> To call upon GOD, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me:</HI> This is the way, to see a glad <HI>Period</HI> put unto your <HI>Oppressions.</HI> The <HI>Experience</HI> of the Pious in all Ages have proved this way. Thousands and Myriads have been the Instances of those, who have been able to say, <HI>This Poor one, was Oppressed, and lamentably distressed, but he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord saved him out of all his Troubles.</HI> To call upon GOD, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, Undertake for me:</HI> This is the way to <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Change</HI> the <HI>Oppressions</HI> immediately. The <HI>Afflictions</HI> may remain, but they shall cease to be <HI>Oppressions.</HI> We shall be able to <HI>stand,</HI> and <HI>walk,</HI> and <HI>look</HI> cheerfully under them. If we were of <HI>Sorrowful Spirits,</HI> yet having <HI>poured out our Souls
<PB N="19" REF="002250_0056_0FDADA96F373A180"/>unto the Lord,</HI> we shall now be <HI>no more sad.</HI> We shall be upheld when we have <HI>cast our Burdens on the Lord.</HI> When <HI>Peter</HI> cries out, <HI>Lord, save me,</HI> the outstretched Arm of the Lord, will <HI>save</HI> His Threat∣ned Servant from sinking in the Black waves which threaten him. This admi∣rable way, of dealing with all our <HI>Un∣easinesses,</HI> I must recommend it univer∣sally, recommend it wonderfully.</P>
<P N="1">I. THIS must be the <HI>Method of Relief,</HI> when you meet with sharp <HI>Scourges</HI> from the Hand of Heaven, upon any of your Enjoyments. Whatever <HI>Oppression</HI> or <HI>Affliction</HI> lies upon you in any of your Enjoyments, Oh! mourn unto the Lord; <HI>Lord, I am oppressed, Undertake for me.</HI> This is the Direction, Jam. V. 13. <HI>Is any afflicted, let him Pray.</HI> So we are di∣rected; Psal. L. 15. <HI>Call on me in the day of trouble.</HI> Are you Oppressed with any <HI>Malady?</HI> Go to that Lord, who is the <HI>Lord our Healer.</HI> Ask the <HI>Healing</HI> In∣fluences of Him, who is the <HI>Lord of our Life.</HI> It was a gross Error in him, who <HI>sought unto the Physicians, and not unto the Lord.</HI> Under all your pains, cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, Undertake
<PB N="20" REF="002250_0057_0FDADA98CA065860"/>for me.</HI> Add that cry; Psal. XLI. 4. <HI>Lord, Heal my Soul; for I have sinned against thee.</HI> Are you <HI>Oppressed</HI> with any <HI>Poverty?</HI> Go to that Lord, who by His <HI>Blessing</HI> does <HI>make rich.</HI> Ask to be <HI>Bless'd</HI> and <HI>Fed</HI> by that Lord, who says, that if you <HI>Trust in Him, and do Good, verily you shall be Fed.</HI> Whatever <HI>Straits</HI> may be upon you, cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, Undertake for me.</HI> Plead that <HI>Bond:</HI> Heb. XIII. V. <HI>He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor for∣sake thee.</HI> Are you brought low, by the <HI>Death</HI> of those in whom your Life was bound up? Do you stoup, &amp; shrink, as under a dismal <HI>Oppression,</HI> because those that were as the very Staff of your Life, are taken from you? Is the <HI>Lamb</HI> that has been <HI>unto you as a Daughter</HI> going from you! Go to that Lord, who has taken your <HI>Friends</HI> from you, and who is infinitely Better than all <HI>Friends.</HI> Ask that you may find him so. Cry out unto Him; <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.</HI> Take with you those words al∣so; Psal. XXV. 16. <HI>Have merry on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THIS must be the <HI>Method of Relief,</HI> when you fall into the Hand of the <HI>Op∣pressor.</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="002250_0058_0FDADA99F60A7130"/>You read; Eccl. V. 8. <HI>Thou see the oppression of the poor; He that is Higher than the Highest, regardeth it,</HI> Let Him that is <HI>Higher than the Highest</HI> then hear from thee, O <HI>oppressed Neighbour.</HI> Tho' thou art never so low, &amp; mean, He will <HI>regard the Oppression.</HI> Do any <HI>Defraud</HI> you, and fraudulently, or violently withold from you, what you have a <HI>Rightful Claim</HI> unto? Do any <HI>misuse</HI> you? Do any <HI>Revile</HI> you? Are you falsely Accused? must you lye under the Load of a <HI>False Accusation,</HI> and the unjust Clamours of unreasonable Persons? Fall down at the Foot of the Holy GOD. Own that He is <HI>Just</HI> in all. Beg that you may get <HI>Good</HI> by all. But cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me!</HI></P>
<P>I will be yet more particular. We read, Gal. VI. 2. <HI>Bear ye one anothers bur∣dens.</HI> Alas, Men make <HI>Burdens</HI> for <HI>one another;</HI> By their <HI>Base Humours</HI> they do so. Sometimes <HI>Relatives</HI> make them∣selves very <HI>Burdensome</HI> to one another. We may have <HI>Relatives</HI> whose vile, fro∣ward, morose Carriage may be so <HI>Bur∣densome</HI> unto us, that we can do nothing, but as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, when <HI>Laban,</HI> and when
<PB N="22" REF="002250_0059_0FDADA9CF12E83E0"/><HI>Esau,</HI> were abusive to him. Do so; and cry unto the Lord; <HI>O Lord, I am oppres∣sed, undertake for me!</HI> We have cause to say, as Psal. LVI. 1. <HI>Be merciful to me, O God, for Man daily oppresseth me.</HI> Who can tell, what will be done; when the multitude of your Oppressions, brings you to cry out, <HI>Where is GOD my Maker.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. THIS must be the <HI>Method of Re∣lief,</HI> when your <HI>Fears,</HI> your <HI>Cares,</HI> your <HI>Employments</HI> are too many for you. They that are afraid, how it may fare with such as are <HI>gone far</HI> from them, and ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>ly n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar</HI> to them: The <HI>Desire of their Eyes</HI> travelled out of their <HI>Sight;</HI> Their <HI>Friends abroad.</HI> Their <HI>Hears</HI> about them, how oppressing are they! They<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly down with them; they rise up with them. Oppressed Hearts Cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, Undertake for me!</HI> Add that Cry; Psal. LXI. 2. <HI>From the End of the Earth will I cry unto thee, when my Heart is Overwhelmed.</HI> Some are in the <HI>Park,</HI> what <HI>Steps</HI> to take, in weighty Affairs before them. They have <HI>Darkness on their paths.</HI> They are at a mighty <HI>Less,</HI> what to do. Their Agony, their <HI>Op∣pression</HI> is unspeakable. <HI>Distressed Minds,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002250_0060_0FDADA9E5B17C2B0"/>cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me!</HI> Add that cry, Psal. XXVII. 11. <HI>Teach me thy way, O Lord; and lead me in a plain path.</HI> Some have more <HI>Wark</HI> to do, than they can <HI>well</HI> do; they are <HI>over wrought; Heavy Tasks</HI> are imposed on them; They have <HI>many</HI> to serve; many <HI>Obligations</HI> to answer. <HI>Weary Men!</HI> cry out; <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me!</HI> Put in suit that word; Isa. LXI. 10. <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee, I will strengthen thee, I will help thee, I will uphold thee.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. THIS must be the <HI>Method of Re∣lief,</HI> when <HI>Troubles</HI> of a more <HI>Spiritual Original</HI> are upon you. When the <HI>Phi∣listines</HI> of Hell, with their <HI>Temptations</HI> are upon you. Are you under <HI>Tempta∣tions; Temptations</HI> to <HI>Infidelity, Temptations</HI> to some <HI>Impurity, Temptations</HI> to any <HI>Im∣piety?</HI> Do your <HI>Temptations</HI> press hard upon you and throw your Souls into a Flame, into a Sweat, into an Intolerable <HI>Agitation;</HI> You may complain, as Psal. LIV. 3. <HI>Oppressors that seek after my Soul have risen up against me.</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> arm'd with our <HI>Lusts,</HI> are the worst <HI>Op∣pressors</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="002250_0061_0FDADA9FC96B02C0"/>in the World; Worse, worse than any on the Coast of <HI>Barbary;</HI> They are <HI>Oppressors</HI> that <HI>seek after the very Life of our Soul.</HI> But unto whom will you make your Complaint? O cast your selves into the <HI>Dust</HI> before the Lord, and from thence cry out unto Him, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.</HI> You may lay to Heart your <HI>Oppression,</HI> as worse than that wherewith we read, the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and after that, the Nati∣ons of <HI>Canaan,</HI> sometimes <HI>oppressed</HI> the People of GOD. You may say with him, Psal. XLIII. 2. <HI>I go mourning because of the oppression of the Enemy.</HI> But then, Let the <HI>Temptations</HI> that <HI>oppress</HI> you, Quicken your cry unto Him, that said, <HI>Behold, the cry of the Children of Israel is come unto me, and I have seen their oppres∣sion wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</HI> Cry out, as under a <HI>Rape.</HI> Cry out, <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me!</HI> Add that cry, Psal. CXIX. 122. <HI>Be sure∣ty for thy Servant for Good; Let not the proud oppress me.</HI> <Q>Lord, none so proud, as the Devils, and the Lusts, which ex∣act from me, the Homage which is due to thee alone.</Q> GOD will break in pie∣ces,
<PB N="25" REF="002250_0062_0FDADAA20E94CDA8"/>the Temptations, that cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, and He will hear the cry of the Afflicted. If the Battle go hard, cry to GOD in the Battle.</P>
<P N="5">V. WE must not break off until the <HI>Suretiship</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST be clearly set before us; the Suretiship in which is laid up all our <HI>Salvation.</HI> Of our SAVIOUR we read, Heb. VII. 22. Our <HI>JESUS made a Surety.</HI> Oh! Give a great Attention!</P>
<P>KNOW it <HI>first;</HI> That you have such <HI>Loads</HI> lying upon you, as will sink you into Eternal Wretchedness, if they be not seasonably taken off. Your <HI>Sins,</HI> your <HI>Sins,</HI> are such mountainous <HI>Loads.</HI> In your Natural State, what are you, but a <HI>People laden with Iniquity!</HI> The <HI>Guilt</HI> which is lying upon you, or a being bound over to suffer the Punish∣ment of Sin: 'Tis a <HI>Load</HI> enough to break the back of an Angel. Ah! Were you not horribly <HI>Dead in Sin,</HI> you would cry out; as Psal. XXXVIII. 4. <HI>My Iniquities are as an heavy Burden, they are too heavy for me.</HI> And the <HI>Rule</HI> of Sin reigning
<PB N="26" REF="002250_0063_0FDADAA6EDBE7EB8"/>over you, how full of <HI>Oppression</HI> is it! <HI>Sin</HI> puts a most <HI>Oppressive Drudgery</HI> on the Sinful Children of Men. Obedience to Sin, 'tis a <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad,</HI> and a <HI>Yoke that cannot be born.</HI> Ah, Did you feel it, as it is, you would cry out; Rom. VII. 24. <HI>O wretch∣ed one that I a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who shall deliver me!</HI> Sinners, That you were but sensible of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> that are upon you! <HI>Loads</HI> that are <HI>pushing</HI> of you to <HI>Death!</HI></P>
<P>BUT Know it, <HI>Secondly;</HI> That a Glo∣rious CHRIST has <HI>Undertaken</HI> to take off the <HI>Loads,</HI> of the Sinners that Sigh and Seek unto Him. Indeed, there was a Day wherein the Great GOD <HI>laid upon Him the Iniquities of us all.</HI> In that black Day we read, Isai. LIII. 7. <HI>He was op∣pressed.</HI> When our SAVIOUR had the <HI>Load</HI> of our Sin lying upon Him, and was making <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for our Sin, He cried out, <HI>I am oppressed, I am sore broken.</HI> What an <HI>Heaviness</HI> was there then upon Him! All this was to Save us out of our <HI>Oppression;</HI> It was to pay a <HI>Ransome</HI> for us! And if we will now <HI>Personally Apply</HI> our selves unto this Glorious CHRIST we shall have Him for our SA∣VIOUR. The <HI>Bond</HI> of our <HI>Iniquity,</HI> will
<PB N="27" REF="002250_0064_0FDADAA80B5B0F08"/>be removed, be cancelled; And <HI>no Ini∣quity shall have Dominion over us.</HI> What an Invitation has this Glorious <HI>Underta∣ker</HI> for <HI>oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed</HI> Souls given unto us! Matth. XI. 28. <HI>Come to me all ye that La∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest. Oppressed</HI> Sinner, Thus Invited by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trong Redeemer,</HI> see thy <HI>Oppressi∣on,</HI> and cry out unto Him; <HI>O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me. My Sins will oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss me, will Destroy me, except Thou be my Surety for Good. I put my self into thy Hands; Oh! Be Thou my Surety and my SAVIOUR.</HI> The Effect of this <HI>Faith</HI> will be, that a Glorious CHRIST, will <HI>Undertake</HI> for thee. But, Oh! What a <HI>Strong Redeemer</HI> wilt thou find Him! His Office is that, Psal. LXXII. 4. <HI>He shall break in pieces the Oppressor; He shall save the Soul of the Needy.</HI> He will Exe∣cute this Office wonderfully for thee.</P>
<P>I have done. You are no doubt a∣ware of it, that some very Afflictive Things in my own Condition, especially on the score of my call this Day to the Sacrifices of a <HI>Jepthah,</HI> and in the Condi∣tion of some very nearly Related unto me; have led me to these Meditations.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002250_0065_0FDADAAA6E939D50"/>
I will only observe to you, these Two Things upon it.</P>
<P>THE One is; That it is a Consolation to me when I am o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and much <HI>oppressed,</HI> and become a <HI>Man of Sorrows,</HI> it is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dered by a Gracious GOD, that some of His People fare the better for my <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣rows;</HI> I can truly say, This renders my <HI>Oppressions</HI> in some Degree <HI>welcome</HI> to me, in that I perceive He makes them <HI>Useful</HI> to the People, unto whose Edifi∣cation my All is Dedicated.</P>
<P>THE Other is; That I can assure you, a poor <HI>Oppressed</HI> Servant of GOD, having the view of a CHRIST concerned for him, and feeling a CHRIST possessing of him, and conversing with him, finds e∣nough and enough to comfort him, in the <HI>Multitude of his Thoughts within him.</HI> Upon the <HI>precious Thoughts</HI> of a CHRIST, he is kept from <HI>fainting</HI> under any <HI>Op∣pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions;</HI> The Fatigue of them Vanishes; He can mount and soar and Sing the Songs, which <HI>GOD our Maker</HI> has pro∣vided for the darkest <HI>Night,</HI> that is ever passing over him.</P>
