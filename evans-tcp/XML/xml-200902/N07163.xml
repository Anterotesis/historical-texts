<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT, by the EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Author</HI> of the following Poem returned to this City, he was concerned to find that several incorrect Copies of his first Plan had been handed about; and was under some Apprehension, lest it should fall into the Hands of some one, who (biassed by Novelty) might publish it in that im∣mature State, in his Absence. This, added to the Expectations, the Authors of the <HI>American MAGAZINE</HI> have given the Publick, of receiving it one Day from the Press, have induced him to furnish a Copy to be submitted to their Candour, sooner than he otherwise in∣tended. He would not however permit it to be published, without an Acknowledgment, that he took the <HI>Hint</HI> of the Transition, from the Court of <HI>Fancy</HI> to that of <HI>Delusion,</HI> from <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Change from the House of <HI>Fame,</HI> to that of <HI>Rumour;</HI> and that in describing the Walls of the Court of <HI>Fancy,</HI> he had his Eye on the Description of the Temple of <HI>Fame.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>COURT</HI> OF <HI>FANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS sultry Noon, impatient of the Heat</L>
<L>I sought the Covert of a close Retreat:</L>
<L>Soft by a bubbling Fountain was I laid,</L>
<L>And o'er my Head the spreading Branches play'd;</L>
<L N="5">When gentle Slumber stole upon my Eyes,</L>
<L>And busy <HI>Fiction</HI> bid this Vision rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>METHOUGHT I pensive unattended stood,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the Horrors of a desert Wood:</L>
<L>Old Night and Silence spread their Sway around,</L>
<L N="10">And not a Breeze disturb'd the Dread profound.</L>
<L>To break the Wild, and gain the neighb'ring Plain,</L>
<L>Oft I essay'd, and oft essay'd in vain;</L>
<L>Still in intricate Mazes round I run.</L>
<L>And ever ended where I first begun.</L>

<L N="15">While thus I lab'ring strove t'explore my Way,</L>

<L>Retiring Night in haste withdrew her Shade,</L>

<L>No more the Scene a desert Wild appear'd,</L>
<L N="20">A smiling Grove its vernal Honors rear'd;</L>
<L>While Sweetness on the balmy Breezes hung,</L>
<L>And all around a joyful Mattin rung.</L>
<L>Soft was the Strain as Zephyr in the Grove,</L>
<L>Or purling Streams that thro' the Meadows rove.</L>
<L N="25">Now wild in Air the varying Strain is tost,</L>
<L>In distant Echoes then the Sound is lost;</L>
<L>Again reviv'd, and lo! the willing Trees</L>
<L>Rise to the pow'rful Numbers by Degrees:</L>
<L>Trees now no more, robb'd of their verdant Bloom,</L>
<L N="30">They shine Supporters of a spacious Dome,</L>
<L>The Wood to bright transparent Crystal chang'd,</L>
<L>High fluted Columns rise in Order rang'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So to the magic of Amphion's Lyre</L>
<L>Stones Motion found, and Theban Walls aspire;</L>
<L N="35">To the soft Sound the nodding Forest rise,</L>
<L>And gilded Turrets glitter in the Skies.</L>
<L>Each wond'ring God bends from his heav'nly Seat</L>
<L>To view what powerful Musick cou'd compleat.</L>

<L N="325">Chill'd Winter's wastes, or Spring's delightful Green,</L>

<L>Here Lawns are spread, there tow'ring Forests wave,</L>
<L>The Heights we fear, or wish the cooling Lave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HER blooming Sister in her Hand she led,</L>
<L N="330">Joy in her Eye, fair <HI>Sculpture</HI> heav'n-taught Maid:</L>
<L>'Tis her's to stone, a mimic Life to give,</L>
<L>Heroes and Sages at her Call revive;</L>
<L>See flow'ry Orators with outstretch'd Hand</L>
<L>Address'd to speak, in glowing Marble stand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="335">SUDDEN I heard soft Sounds, a pleasing Strain,</L>
<L><HI>Music</HI> advanc'd with all her heavn'ly Train;</L>
<L>Sweetly enraptur'd, then my Pulse beat high,</L>
<L>And my Breast glow'd, fraught with unusual Joy.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH Turrets crown'd bright <HI>Architecture</HI> shone,</L>
<L>The lovely Maid, with easy Steps came on;</L>
<L N="345">Graceful her Mein, her Looks celestial shin'd,</L>
<L>Where Majesty and softning Beauty join'd</L>
<L>At her Command see lofty Piles ascend,</L>
<L>Columns aspire, triumphal Arches bend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ASTRONOMY with proud aspiring Eye,</L>
<L N="350">Gaz'd on the glowing Beauties of the Sky.</L>
<L>Her Vest with glitt'ring Stars was spangled o'er,</L>
<L>And in her Hand a Telescope she bore,</L>
<L>With this she marks the rolling Planets Way,</L>
<L>Or where portentous Comets dreadful stray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="355">THO' last not least <HI>Philosophy</HI> was seen,</L>
<L>Slow was her Step, and awful was her Mien;</L>
<L>A Volume open in her Hand she held,</L>
<L>With Nature's Law the ample Page was fill'd:</L>

<PB N="19" REF="009127_0019_10303250E1FEA6E8"/>
<L>NOW suddenly the Scene was chang'd again,</L>
<L>And brought to View <HI>Delusion</HI>'s spreading Reign;</L>
<L N="365">There intermingl'd Hills and Rocks were seen,</L>
<L>Here shady Groves and flow'ry Lawns between.</L>
<L>Full in the Front a lofty Pile was rear'd,</L>
<L>The Architecture old and rude appear'd.</L>
<L><HI>Delusion</HI> here resides, within confin'd</L>
<L N="370">Gay fictions lurk, and Dreams of ev'ry Kind.</L>
<L>Constant as Waters roll or Flames ascend,</L>
<L>Hither their Course the rising Vapours bend;</L>
<L>Drest by her Hand they shine with mimic Bloom,</L>
<L>Or at her Word their Nothingness resume:</L>
<L N="375">But still from <HI>Fancy</HI> all her Pow'r she draws,</L>
<L>Bows to her Name, and owns her sacred Laws.</L>
<L>Some in light Dreams the sleeping Senses move,</L>
<L>And led by them, the Thoughts unsettled rove:</L>
<L>Others more bold, majestic Portments take,</L>
<L N="380">And Plague delighted those who dream awake:</L>
<L>Such are the Dreams of those who thirst for Pow'r,</L>
<L>The superstitious, and a Thousand more.</L>
<L>Others usurp the Features of the Dead,</L>
<L>And shake the Torch around the Murth'rer's Bed;</L>
<L N="385">Affright the Vigil, or in wanton Mirth</L>
<L>Make Fools seek hidden Treasures in the Earth,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="009127_0020_1031074552BAF7B8"/>Or lead the weary Traveller awry,</L>
<L>Or rising Flame Amazement in the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW with the Croud <HI>Delusion</HI> forward came,</L>
<L N="390">A Troop of Phantoms flutter'd round the Dame;</L>
<L>In Bands the Throng she instantly divides,</L>
<L>A Phantom over ev'ry Band presides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOREMOST a bright majestic Form appear'd,</L>
<L>And in her Hand the honour'd Fasces rear'd:</L>
<L N="395">Forward she strode with more than virgin Pace,</L>
<L>And lear'd upon the Croud, with haughty Grace;</L>
<L><HI>Power</HI> was her Name, assuming selfish Pride,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring Pomp attended by her Side.</L>
<L>Her fav'rite Son high on a Seat she plac'd,</L>
<L N="400">With mimic Gems and glassy Bawbles grac'd:</L>
<L>Close by his Side was seated winkl'd Care,</L>
<L>While Envy view'd him with malicious Stare;</L>
<L>Sternly he eyed around the servile Throng,</L>
<L>While loud Acclaim proceeded from each Tongue;</L>
<L N="405">But from the giddy Height devolving soon,</L>
<L>Reproach, Contempt and Shame is on him thrown.</L>
<L>Eager another mounts the Chair of Pow'r,</L>
<L>And shines the empty Pageant of an Hour.</L>

<PB N="21" REF="009127_0021_1031074BB6BE1960"/>
<L>DAME <HI>Superstition</HI> was the next came on,</L>
<L N="410">Bright on her Head the gilded Mitre shone,</L>
<L>Varying her Aspect, now she rais'd her Eye,</L>
<L>And seem'd bewilder'd with extatic Joy;</L>
<L>Then sudden Gloom her Countenance depress'd,</L>
<L>Tears roll'd apace, and Sorrow heav'd her Breast;</L>
<L N="415">Now calm again, she silent view'd around</L>
<L>The prostrate Croud bent humbly to the Ground:</L>
<L>Then caught with sudden Rage she hurl'd about</L>
<L>Her thund'ring Anathema among the Rour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AN aged wrinkl'd <HI>Hag</HI> the next appear'd,</L>
<L N="420">Four mouldring Turrets o'er her Temples rear'd.</L>
<L>In Rows like Beads the faithful Medals tied,</L>
<L>In ornamental Rust adorn'd her Side:</L>
<L>A broken Column of an ancient Date</L>
<L>She dragg'd, and sinking seem'd beneath the Weight;</L>
<L N="425">The Column all admire, the Medals more,</L>
<L>"Th' Inscription value, but the Rust adore."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE next to her approach'd a rev'rend <HI>Dame,</HI></L>
<L>In Trophies great from Insects torn she came;</L>
<L>With stately Step she trod the Plain along,</L>
<L N="430">And threw her Treasure 'midst th' admiring Throng:</L>
<L>Forward with Joy, each curious Mortal sprang,</L>
<L>This caught a gaudy Wing, and that a pointed Fang.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="009127_0022_1031074D46689C18"/>
<L>BEFORE the giddy Throng, which now advanc'd,</L>
<L>With mincing Step gay <HI>disolution</HI> danc'd;</L>
<L N="435">Then sudden stopp'd, and staring on the Croud</L>
<L>She frown'd, then smil'd, and giggl'd out aloud;</L>
<L>The num'rous Throng attending round the Fair,</L>
<L>Mimick'd her Gestures, and assum'd her Air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Croud of Mortals here with wond'ring Eyes,</L>
<L N="440">All pale and trembling gaz'd upon the Skies,</L>
<L>Where on blue Plains opposing Hosts engage,</L>
<L>While Shouts are heard, and all the Battle's rage;</L>
<L>Amidst the Throng, stood cold and heartless <HI>Fear,</HI></L>
<L>The Fall of Nations whisp'ring in each Ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="445">HERE pallid Spectres gleam'd, and there were seen</L>
<L>The fairy Train in Gambols on the Green:</L>
<L>Thro' miry Ways the Rustick journeys round,</L>
<L>Nor dares presuming tread the hallow'd Ground:</L>
<L>Dire Ills await the Wretch, so fable sings,</L>
<L N="450">Or pinch'd all o'er, or pierc'd with thousand Stings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Structure ent'ring, as around I threw</L>
<L>My wond'ring Eyes, gay Forms arose to View,</L>
<L>False <HI>Pleasure</HI> here the borrow'd Form of Joy</L>
<L>Assum'd, and roll'd around her sparkling Eye:</L>
<L N="455">But who allur'd by her inchanting Song,</L>
<L>From Virtue shrinks, and mingles with her Throng,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="009127_0023_1031074F16A39010"/>Soon sees her Beauties fade, and to his Eyes</L>
<L>Deformity and sad Disease arise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN a dark Corner hell-born <HI>Jealousy,</HI></L>
<L N="460">A Wan and haggard Spright, I did espy;</L>
<L>Watchful she roll'd her ghastly Eyes around,</L>
<L>And cautious trod, to catch the whisp'ring Sound:</L>
<L>Her Heart forever deathless Vultures tear,</L>
<L>And by her Side stalk Anguish and Despair:</L>
<L N="465">Curst is the Wretch with her dire Rage possess'd,</L>
<L>When fancied Ills destroy his wonted Rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PALE <HI>Avarice</HI> appear'd with Looks of Care,</L>
<L>And clasp'd her Bags with never-ceasing Fear;</L>
<L>Close following her a wretched Spectre came,</L>
<L N="470">With tatter'd Garments, <HI>Poverty</HI> her Name,</L>
<L>In vain her Search t'elude still Av'rice strives,</L>
<L>Amidst her Store in endless Want she lives.</L>

<LG>
<L>FALSE <HI>Honour</HI> here I saw all gayly drest,</L>
<L>Glass were her Beads, and tinsel'd was her Vest,</L>
<L N="475">Form'd in barbaric Ages, rude her Mien,</L>
<L>And in her Hand the sanguin'd Sword was seen;</L>
<L>Not stain'd like Patriots in their Country's Cause,</L>
<L>To save Religion, or support the Laws:</L>
<L>In private Strife the Crimson Torrents flow,</L>
<L N="480">Their Country wounded by each fatal Blow.</L>
