<HEAD>The Argument.</HEAD>
<P>INvocation—Begins [in the Year <HI>1753</HI>] with the Cause of the War, the Depredations and Hostilities of the Indians, in the profound of Peace, thro' the French Instiga∣tion—touching upon the Miscarriage of our Arms in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> which excite his Britannic Majesty to a just Sense of the imminent Danger his American Empire is threatened with; who summons a Parliament, and Mr. Secretary <HI>Pitt</HI> — describes the deplorable Situation of Affairs in that Part of the World — Mr. Secretary <HI>Pitt's</HI> Address, imploring his Majesty's Royal Order — Who declares the French Perfidy, exciting them to Revenge — And proposes an immediate Descent upon the Island of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> with a strong Fleet, and sufficient Land-Army, under the Com∣mand of Admiral <HI>Boscawen,</HI> and General <HI>Amhurst,</HI> whom [by Mr. <HI>Pitt's</HI> Advice] he recommends to his Parlia∣ment, which is approv'd of, with all the Demonstration of Joy and Satisfaction—the Fleet consisting of twenty four Ships of War (exclusive of near One Hundred &amp; forty Sail of Trans∣ports) Rendezvous at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> from whence they embark with twelve Thousand Land Forces for <HI>Halifax,</HI> where they are join'd by General <HI>Lawrence</HI> with six Thousand Aids, who all embark for <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> arrive there <HI>[May 1758]</HI> in six Days, land their Troops, (of which eighteen are drowned) and drive the Enemy from the Shore — General <HI>Amhurst</HI> marches to the Attack of their Advance Battery; and after a sharp Conflict drives them to the City —
<PB N="ii" REF="008193_0003_102E4A1A517DE3D8"/>The intrepid Valour and Prowess of <HI>Amhurst, Wolf, Whit∣more, Lawrence, Frazer, &amp; Scott</HI>—Their several Actions in that Heroic Enterprize—The General opens his Lines, and begins the Seige—In the mean Tims <HI>Boscawen, Hardy,</HI> and <HI>Durell,</HI> Bombard and Cannonade the Enemy from their Fleet— A Bomb thrown from the English, falls on the French Admiral's Ship, and destroys her — The Enemy seiz'd with Despair, sink two of their Ships — The Horror of a Seige describ'd — Forty Days having elaps'd, and a Breach forc'd in their Walls, they Capitulate Prisoners of War—but by the Admiral are sent to <HI>France</HI> (except their regular Troops) Brigadier <HI>Monckton,</HI> goes on Command to <HI>St. John's River,</HI> and returns from his Expedition with Success—which concludes the Poem—</P>

<L>And wing fam'd Heroes to her dark Domain.</L>
<L N="335">The cutting Grape-shot spatter o'er the Heath,</L>
<L>And the fierce Langrel aid the glare of Death.</L>
<L>In such sad Scenes alternately involv'd,</L>
<L>Till one fair Season half her Course dissolv'd.</L>
<L>Too much the odds—the Gallic Ensigns struck,</L>
<L N="340">By all their patron Images forsook,</L>
<L>With drooping Flag and solemn Pace advance,</L>
<L>Their Courage faints, nor more can stand the Chance.</L>
<L>The last sad Purpose of their Soul's impart,</L>
<L>And claim the Mercy of a British Heart.</L>
<L N="345">The gen'rous Heroes, fir'd with manly Grief,</L>
<L>Nor hear them twice, implore a kind Relief:</L>
<L>But waft them to their ancient Mother Shoar,</L>
<L>Tho' at their Option, Prisoners of War.</L>
<L>Three Cheers ensue—then thrice the glad Parole,</L>
<L N="350">BOSCAWEN, AMHURST, and a British Soul.</L>
<L>While MONCKTON, his late Conquest to secure,</L>
<L>O'er all Accadia takes his eager Tour,</L>
<L>Hunts the black Savage from the Covert brake,</L>
<L>Who a last Farewell of their Eden take.</L>

Thus blest by Heav'n in an important Hour,</L>
<L>A spacious Region owns the British Pow'r.</L>
<L>Now a smooth Surface all along is seen,</L>
<L>And the white Tents harmonious intervene.</L>
<L>A fair Encampment open to the view,</L>
<L N="360">With gay Decorum to enhance the Shew.</L>
<L>Like social Heroes pass the Hours away,</L>
<L>Till <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Duty urge them for the Day.</L>
