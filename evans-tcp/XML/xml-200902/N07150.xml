<SPEAKER>LORENZO.</SPEAKER>
<L>ENOUGH, ye Sons of SCIENCE! Honours meet</L>
<L>At your maternal Shrine have now been paid.</L>
<L>From the fair Fount of HELICON divine</L>
<L>Pure living Streams enraptur'd have ye drawn</L>
<L>Of Classic Lore, and bade them copious flow</L>
<L>To grace the Prospects of this festive Day,</L>
<L>Meanwhile each Patriot Eye with Transport gaz'd;</L>
<L>Each Friend of Worth, of Science and of Man</L>
<L>With chearing Smiles their silent Plaudit gave.</L>
<L>SAY then, my Friends, have ye no Chaplets weav'd,</L>
<L>No jocund Song prepar'd, of sprightliest Strain,</L>
<L>To crown the Labours of the learned Tribe,</L>
<L>And sooth with Warblings sweet the parting Ear?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGENIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>YES, my LORENZO! grateful will we pay</L>
<L>All seemly Tribute to this glad Occasion:</L>
<L>Nor Chaplets gay, nor Song of sprightliest Strain</L>
<L>Will we refuse. See good AMYNTOR's Eye</L>
<L>Sparkles with Joy, and speaks some rapt'rous Theme.</L>

<SPEAKER>AMYNTOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHAT Theme more joyous, or can better suit</L>
<L>The glad Return of this auspicious Day,</L>
<L>Than that which occupies my present Thought,</L>
<L>And which the faithful Index of my Heart</L>
<L>Pointed to thy Discerning. Know, EUGENIO,</L>
<L>The Joy, that sports in thy AMYNTOR's Breast</L>
<L>And o'er his Visage spreads this placid Smile,</L>
<L>Springs from no other Source than the loud Fame</L>
<L>Of his young Monarch's Worth. Be this our Theme.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGENIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>AND is it thus, AMYNTOR? Ah! how soon</L>
<L>To Sounds of Grief succeeds the Voice of Joy,</L>
<L>And gilded Trappings to the Garb of Woe!</L>
<L>Far other Scenes thy lab'ring Breast disclos'd,</L>
<L>When last I met Thee at these <HI>annual Rites,</HI></L>
<L>With Visage wan, with dark and downward Brow;</L>
<L>When royal Dust receiv'd the duteous Tear,</L>
<L>When trembled with the Dirge this stately Dome,</L>
<L>And gloom'd these hallow'd Walls with Wreaths funereal.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMYNTOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>O name it not, my Friend! all custom'd Dues</L>
<L>To Majesty entomb'd were then discharg'd.</L>
<L>To dwell desponding on the mournful Theme,</L>
<L>Or hang like Statues o'er the kingly Urn</L>
<L>Pale, motionless as Marble, this were impious,</L>
<L>A Censure weak and rash of Heaven's Decree.</L>
<L>Shout then, ye favour'd Race, ye Sons of Freedom!</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="009108_0004_1031010DACD5DC08"/>Bound every Heart with Joy, and every Breast</L>

<L>For o'er the Realms of BRITAIN reigns supreme,</L>
<L>The Darling of his People, GEORGE the GOOD.</L>
<L>Bright-clustring round his Throne the <HI>Virtues</HI> stand</L>
<L>In meet Array, obsequious, at his Call,</L>

<SPEAKER>LORENZO.</SPEAKER>
<L>THRICE happy Monarch! skill'd in every Art</L>

<L>Thy youthful Blossoms are the Earnests sure</L>
<L>Of future Glories to thy native Land.</L>

<L>The wise Exertions of his kingly Power,</L>
<L>Doth GEORGE illustrious move: each milder Virtue,</L>
<L>Each soft endearing Scene of private Life</L>
<L>His tender Soul embraces; modest Worth,</L>
<L>Grace unaffected, true Simplicity</L>
<L>With Dignity combin'd, each nameless Joy</L>
<L>That HYMEN twines around his silken Bands,</L>
<L>He meets with Transport in his CHARLOTTE's Arms,</L>
<L>The pleasing Partner of his Heart and Throne.</L>
