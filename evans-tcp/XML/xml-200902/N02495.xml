<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Lord our GOD, who reigns King forever, is the hope of Israel and the Saviour thereof in time of Trouble: And he invites his People under Publick Calamities to come, and enter into the Cham∣bers of his Protection till the in∣dignation be overpast; assuring us that he who dwells in the secret place of the most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

Being therefore call'd, tho' most unworthy, to deliver the Lords Message to you, upon the great &amp; mournful Occasion of this Day, I have chosen this Text, in which we are encourag'd to look to the Lord Jehovah as our Judge and Lawgiver, our King and Saviour. Jehovah is our Judge —
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> is mentioned three times in the Original.</NOTE> GOD is this, and much more to his People: He sustains these Offices for them in an Eminent and Transcendent manner. And these words may in a particular manner refer to the Second Person in the Godhead, to whom the Father hath com∣mitted all Judgment, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour. I shall speak to them under a fourfold Consideration as they lie in the Text.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. I. <HI>THE Lord Jehovah is the Judge of his Church and People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Verb</HI> is observ'd to signify to Judge, to pass Sentence, and to execute Judgment. The Power of a Judge is Executive, and his Business is to take care that the Laws be duly Executed. As the Word is used in Scripture, and applyed to GOD, it signifieth his plead∣ing the Cause of his People, and delivering them out of the hands of them that oppress them. GOD is the Judge of all Men, and hath appointed a Day in which he will Judge the World in Righteousness, by that Man whom he hath Ordained. But then this is the peculiar Privilege of the People of GOD, that their<PB N="3" REF="002957_0006_0FE6A564428464D8"/>Lord is their Judge. Thus it is promised, Deut. 32.36. <HI>The Lord shall judge his People.</HI> Heb. 12.22. Ye are come unto Mount Zion, to GOD the <HI>Judge of all.</HI> And indeed these words of our Text may look forward as far as the last and general Judgment. The Servants of GOD commit their cause unto him, and he doth and will appear to doe them Justice against their oppressours. They have a gracious and favourable access to GOD's Judgment Seat, and it is their strong Consolation that all Judgment is committed to the Lord Jesus Christ, their Head and Redeemer: Having their Persons justified thro' his Righteousness, and being sanctified by his Spirit; They may say, Job 13.18, 19. <HI>I know I shall be justified. Who is he that will plead with me?</HI> Here to shew what may be implied in GOD's being the Judge of his People. We may say,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS may imply, <HI>That GOD appoints and orders out to them the Judgments inflicted on them in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>GOD in his Providence chastiseth his People for their Iniquities in this Life; but then he Corrects them with <HI>Judgment.</HI> He sometimes makes use even of wicked Men, as the Rod of his Anger in this mat∣ter; however he sets bounds to their Rage. There's a vast difference between the Judgments GOD brings on his People, and on impenitent Sinners, as to the ground of them, and their final Issue. GOD loveth his People while he chastens them; he designs their Good by their Afflictions, and gives them reason to say, It is good for them that they have been afflicted. 1 Cor. 11.32. <HI>When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD will acquit his People, and declare their Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>IN this World their Judgment is often taken away. Their Right is turned away before the most High, and their Cause perverted. Many a time have they been misrepresented accus'd and condemn'd unjustly;
<PB N="4" REF="002957_0007_0FE6A5AAF8A870B8"/>but GOD will admit their Appeal, and reverse these Judgments. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right? Most certainly he will. The great Day will be the Revelation of the Judgment of GOD, when all shall be able to discern between the Righ∣teous and the Wicked, and be obliged to own, <HI>There is a GOD who judgeth in the Earth.</HI> For then will he give to his People the <HI>white Stone</HI> in the most Publick manner, and pronounce them Righ∣teous before the whole World. Their Judgment shall be brought forth as the light, and their Righ∣teousness as the Noon-day. Psal. 96.10. — <HI>He shall judge the people righteously.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As their Judge, <HI>GOD will give his People a glorious Reward.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lord JESUS CHRIST who hath purchas'd the recompence of Reward by his perfect Obedience in doing and suffering the Will of GOD, makes that gracious Promise, <HI>Be thou saithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.10.</NOTE>. The SON OF GOD will Reward his People according to their Works, tho' all be of free Grace. Some Rewards he gives his Disciples upon Earth as an Earnest: There are temporal and spiritual Blessings, which they now receive, and in the great Day of Judgment they shall receive a Crown of Righteousness. 2 Tim. 4.8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ∣teousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give at that Day; and not to me only; but to all them that love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT may imply, <HI>That GOD will execute Judg∣ment on their implacable Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>VENGEANCE is the LORD'S, and he will repay it. 2 Thes. 1.6. <HI>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you,</HI> GOD hath often appear'd for his People in the Judg∣ments which he hath executed on their Enemies.
<PB N="5" REF="002957_0008_0FE6A571610B03D0"/>Thus he appear'd as the Judge of his People when he over-threw <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Host in the Red-Sea. Thus did he appear when he rais'd up <HI>Judges</HI> who were Instruments in his hand of delivering his People, and destroying their Enemies. Thus will CHRIST appear when he shall destroy <HI>Antichrist,</HI> by the Brightness of his Coming. And thus in an emi∣nent manner, when he shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Ven∣geance on them that know not his Name, and obey not his Gospel
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thes 1.8, 9.</NOTE>. For then shall <HI>those Enemies of GOD and his People,</HI> be <HI>punished with everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and the glory of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>USE 2. LEARN, <HI>That it is a very dangerous thing falsely to Accuse, and wrongfully Condemn the People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been common for them to have things laid to their Charge they are not guilty of. The Christians were a <HI>Sect every where spoken against,</HI> Acts 28.22. They are often dress'd up in Bear-skins that they may be baited. But Wo to such as do in this way hinder them from doing or receiving Good: For GOD will plead their Cause in the Day of Ven∣geance. And dreadful, very dreadful will their Con∣demnation be who shall then be found guilty of this crying Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS should Comfort GOD's People under all the Reproaches &amp; Evils they are loaded with in this World.</HI></P>
<P>WHO is he that Condemneth, it is GOD that Justifieth? They may indeed for the present be under great difficulties upon this account. Men may speak evil of them, and they may be loaded with Curses; but GOD will Bless. They shall be <HI>clothed in white Raiment,</HI> and CHRIST will not blot out their Names out of the Book of Life; but will confess them before his Father, and the holy Angels. They may now lie
<PB N="6" REF="002957_0009_0FE6A5AC68641298"/>in the Dust; but they shall arise &amp; shine; and the things that now obscure them, shall be done away as the shades of the Night are chased away before the ri∣sing Sun. Now this consideration shou'd Comfort the faithful Servants of GOD under Reproaches, and En∣courage them to commit themselves to him that Judg∣eth righteously. The Apostle says, 1 Cor. 4.3. — <HI>With me it is a small thing that I should be judged of you, or man's judgment.</HI> — ver. 4. — <HI>He that judgeth me is the Lord.</HI> If we approve ourselves to the Lord, and obtain his <HI>Euge,</HI> we are safe and happy: and in the believing Prospect of this, GOD's People shou'd now Rejoice.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET us not <HI>rashly Judge and Condemn one another.</HI></P>
<P>WE must take heed we do not rashly Censure others. Mat. 7.1. <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Not that all Judging is unlawful; but for Men without any Call or Warrant from GOD to cite their Neighbour to their Bar, and pass Sentence against him; this is a great Evil we should beware of, and that from this Consideration, that the LORD is our Judge. Rom. 14.10. <HI>Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ.</HI> O let us look to our Hearts &amp; Ways, that our own Consciences may not condemn us! And not be hasty to condemn others. 1 Cor. 4.5. <HI>Therefore judge no∣thing before the time, until the Lord come</HI> —.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. II. <HI>THE Lord Jehovah is the Law-giver of his People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is GOD's Prerogative, who hath made all things, to give Law to the whole Creation. But in a pecu∣liar manner GOD is a <HI>Law-giver</HI> to the <HI>moral World</HI> of Angels &amp; Men, who are Causes by Counsel, and capable of understanding the Rules according to which GOD will have them Act. GOD is a Law-giver to all Men. He hath given them the moral Law which is of divine &amp; unchangeable Right. And tho' this Law which was at first written on Man's Heart in a fair
<PB N="7" REF="002957_0010_0FE6A571784D8360"/>Character be dreadfully defac'd by Sin, yet the most barbarous Nations have some knowledge as of a Deity, so his Law, by the Light of Nature, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15.</P>
<P>BUT now, GOD is in a more appropriate sense a Law-giver to his People, in that he gives them his <HI>written Word,</HI> and writes his Laws in their Hearts by his Spirit. Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation.</HI> GOD's ancient People received from him the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> Exod. 20. Deut. 32.2. <HI>The Lord came from mount Sinai — from his right hand went a fiery Law for them —. It was delivered out of the midst of the fire.</HI> The <HI>Ceremonial Law;</HI> containing the Ordinances of GOD's Worship appropriated to the Church State under that Dispensa∣tion. The <HI>Judicial Law;</HI> which was suited to their Civil Polity, in which respect the Jewish Nation was a <HI>Theocracy.</HI> As to the Moral Law, our Saviour him∣self hath said, <HI>I am not come to destroy the Law and the 'Prophets, but to fulfil.</HI> As to the Ceremonial Law, this is abolish'd by CHRIST the Head. Eph. 2.15. <HI>He abolish'd in his flesh the law of command∣ments contain'd in ordinances.</HI> And now our SA∣VIOUR as the only Head of his Church, and Lord of his own House, hath appointed those Laws and Ordinances whereby he will have his professing Peo∣ple govern'd to the End of the World. Mat. 28.10, 20. <HI>Go ye teach all Nations — Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</HI> —. He hath given the most excellent Rules for regulating his People both with respect to their inward and outward Man. And these bind the Conscience; for they are His, who is the Lord of Conscience.</P>
<P>USE, I. LEARN <HI>the great Sin &amp; Evil of Dis∣obedience in a professing People.</HI></P>
<P>DISOBEDIENCE to the Laws of GOD, our Maker and Sovereign, must needs be a great Evil. This brought Disorder and Confusion into the World at first. The Sins of the Heathen are provoking to
<PB N="8" REF="002957_0011_0FE6A5AC84E91480"/>GOD, and render them obnoxious to his righteous Judgments. How much more heinous must be the Sin of those who have the written Word of GOD, GOD Articl'd against his People of old that he had <HI>written to them the great things of his Law, but they were counted as a strange thing,</HI> Hos. 8.12. O let us take Care then to yield Obedience to CHRIST: For to him that knows <HI>to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is Sin,</HI> Jam. 4, 17. And such may expect to be beaten with many stripes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HOW happy are the Church and People of GOD who have GOD for their Law-giver.</HI></P>
<P>Deut. 4.7. <HI>What nation is there so great, that hath Judgments so righteous, as all this Law which I set before you.</HI> The Laws of GOD are all holy, just and good. There's nothing oppressive in them. <HI>CHRIST's Yoke is Easy</HI> — None of his Com∣mands are grievous. Indeed the Lusts of Men make them uneasy under them; but they are all suited to make his People holy and happy. O happy! thrice happy, did we understand our Privilege in this respect. Blessed are you People of the Lord! Let <HI>Greece</HI> boast in her admired <HI>Solon:</HI> And the <HI>Lucedemonians</HI> in their celebrated <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> But O <HI>Zion</HI> do thou Rejoice in CHRIST JESUS thy Law-giver, who is infinitely Wise, infinitely Just, infinitely Good.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LET the People of GOD yield a chearful Obedience to the Laws of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>LET us have a great Regard to the weighty mat∣ters of GOD's Law, and esteem his Judgments to be desired more than Gold, yea than much fine Gold. Let us hearken to them, and diligently observe them; because it is our Life. Let us take Care to keep the Worship of GOD pure and entire without Corrupt mixtures of Man's Invention. For one great reason why our Fore-fathers lest their native Country, and came into this Land was, that they might observe the Orders and Ordinances of CHRIST, without the In∣ventions of Men. Let us then stand fast in that Li∣berty wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. III. <HI>THE Lord Jehovah is the King of his People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GOD is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: <HI>His Dominion ruleth over all.</HI> But in an especial manner is he King in Zion. Isa. 44.6. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel.</HI> GOD governs the whole World, and makes the wrath of Man to praise him; but it is his People that willingly submit to his di∣vine Authority. Isa. 63.19. <HI>We are thine, thou never barest rule over them,</HI> they were not called by thy Name. Now GOD hath set his SON at the Head of the whole Creation, and Rules by Him. Unto the SON he saith, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever, a Scepter of Righteousness is the Scepter of thy King∣dom,</HI> Heb. 1.8. He who is in the <HI>Form of GOD</HI>—. was made in the <HI>likeness of Men;</HI> and being found in fashion as a Man, he <HI>humbled himself,</HI> and became obe∣dient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. Wherefore FOD hath <HI>highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 2.6, — 11.</NOTE>. He is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of GOD, Angels, Authorities &amp; Powers being made Sub∣ject to him. The great GOD our SAVIOUR makes his Angels ministring Spirits, and by him Kings Reign. <HI>He removeth Kings, and serveth up Kings,</HI> Dan. 2.21. Here, that we may a little illustrate this great Truth, I shall very briefly consider these fol∣lowing particulars;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD hath constituted &amp; anointed his Son to he the King of his People.</HI></P>
<P>As GOD, all Power is His Essentially. <HI>I and my Father are one,</HI> Job. 10.30. As <HI>Mediator,</HI> He re∣ceiveth the Kingdom from his Father: The Father of Glory hath call'd him to this high Office, and invested him with it. Psal. 2.6, 7. Yet have <HI>I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</HI> The Lord hath said unto me, <HI>Thou art my Son</HI>—.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="002957_0013_0FE6A5B727D96A80"/>
2. <HI>THE Son of GOD subdueth his People to himself, and sets up his Kingdom in their Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>THEY were all by Nature under the Dominion of Sin, and Tyranny of Satan, who Rules in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience. Having rebelled against their rightful Lord, they became the Slaves of this Usurper. But now our Lord JESUS CHRIST casts down Satan from his usurped Throne, and sets up his Kingdom in the Hearts of his People, 2 Gor. 10.4, 5. <HI>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</HI> He hath reconciled them that were Ene∣mies in their Minds by wicked Works
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Col. 1.21.</NOTE>, bound the strong one, and spoil'd him of his goods. When He pleaseth, in his majesty he rides prosperously because of truth and righteousness: His arrows of Conviction are sharp in the Hearts of his Enemies, and they fall down under him, being subdued to the obedience of Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE People of GOD make Choice of</HI> CHRIST <HI>for their King.</HI></P>
<P>THEY that belong to his visible Kingdom, own him as their King, and swear Allegiance to him, re∣ceiving the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> by which their solemn Obli∣gations to be his faithful and obedient Subjects, are sign'd &amp; seal'd. And true Believers swear with all their hearts. CHRIST is their Head and LORD by their own voluntary Choice and free Election: for he inclines their Hearts to accept of him by his victorious Power &amp; Grace. When his Spirit comes upon them, they say, Thine we are, O Son of <HI>David,</HI> and on thy side. <HI>O Lord our God, other Lords have had domi∣nion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name,</HI> Isa. 26.13. Thus his People are <HI>willing</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002957_0014_0FE6A57A42F6C230"/>in the <HI>day</HI> of his <HI>Power,</HI> Psal. 110.3. This King Reigns in their Hearts. Let the Title of earthly Princes be ever so Just, yet sometimes their People are Rebellious, and will not do the Homage which is their due. But when the Lord JESUS CHRIST takes to himself his great Power and Reigns, there's a mighty Change made on the Hearts of his Subjects, so that they bow down and submit to his equal Scepter, and that with a willing Mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>WHATEVER is done in the Church of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>must be done in his Name, and by his Au∣thority.</HI></P>
<P>HE is the Lord of this spiritual House. Heb. 3.6. <HI>But Christ as a Son over his own House: whose House are we</HI> —. He hath made the Laws &amp; Ordinances whereby it is govern'd, as we have heard; and all that is done by the Officers of his appointment, must be done in his Name, and according to his declared Will. They act as Servants under him, and their Power is ministerial not lordly, 1 Pet. 5.3. <HI>Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the Flock.</HI> Col. 3.17. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <HI>do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> giving Thanks to GOD and the Father by him.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>THE Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>governs all things in the Kingdom of 'Providence with an especial re∣gard to the Welfare of his People.</HI></P>
<P>Eph. 1.22. And hath put all things under his feet, and given him to be <HI>Head over all things to the Church.</HI> The LORD governs the whole World with an Eye to the Salvation of his People, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.3. For I am the Lord thy GOD, the holy One of Israel, thy Saviour, <HI>I gave Egypt for thy Ransom.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>protects his People, and subdueth their Enemies for them.</HI></P>
<P>HE fights their Battles, and gives them the Vic∣tory — <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.6. Thy right hand, O Lord is be∣come glorious in power: <HI>Thy right hand, O Lord,
<PB N="12" REF="002957_0015_0FE6483333B23CD8"/>hath dashed in pieces the Enemy.</HI> Rom. 8.37. In all these things we are more than <HI>Conquerors, thro' him that loved us.</HI> But something further of this may be con∣sidered under the last Proposition. I shall now in a word or two Improve this Proposition.</P>
<P>USE 1. Is CHRIST the King of his People, <HI>We should then do our utmost that his Kingdom may flou∣rish and be established among us.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT is our Privilege that his visible Kingdom is set up among us, and very strong are our Obligations to submit to his Government our selves, and to endea∣vour that it may flourish in the hearts of others. We are directed to Pray, <HI>Thy Kingdom come;</HI> Now in this Kingdom GOD the Father Rules by his Son. And it is spiritual. Rom. 14.17. <HI>The Kingdom of God is not meat &amp; drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</HI> Let us then, in our several Places, employ our Talents, that Sobriety, Righteous∣ness &amp; Godliness may be maintain'd &amp; increas'd among us. And especially, Let such as are vested with Au∣thority be in all humility entreated to exert themselves mightily for the Honour of GOD and the advancement of pure Religion. And O that there were such a Spirit in us all! that we might unite as one Man in this great and good Work: For GOD declares, that the <HI>work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righte∣ousness, quietness &amp; assurance for ever</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 32.17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>THE People of GOD should Rejoice in their King.</HI></P>
<P>HERE is matter of universal Joy: The Lord reigns, let the Earth rejoice. It is owing to this, that there is any good Order and civil Peace among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> tho' they know not GOD, as manifested in his Son JESUS CHRIST. How shou'd <HI>Zion</HI> then rejoice and triumph in her King! Zeph. 3.14, 15. <HI>Sing, O daughter of Zion, shout O Israel, be glad &amp; rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem — The King of Israel, even the Lord is in the midst of thee</HI> —.

<P>I would further say,</P>
<P N="1">I. THE Lord will save his People <HI>from all their Enemies, and every Evil.</HI> He redeems his Israel out of all Adversity. More particularly,</P>
<P>HE will deliver his People from <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the worst of Evils, and the Cause of all Evil. But our Lord saves his People from it, Matth. 1.21. — Thou shalt call his Name JESUS: <HI>for he shall save his people from their Sins.</HI> When the SON of GOD in our Nature suffer'd on the Cross, He condemned Sin in the Flesh
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.3.</NOTE> For he <HI>was made Sin for us, who know no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.22. GOD laid upon him the Iniquities of all his People, and he so bore them as to bear them away, by making full Ex∣piation to divine Justice for them, and purchasing a compleat Deliverance from this destroying Evil. And GOD hath <HI>Exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince &amp; Saviour, to give Repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of Sins,</HI> Acts 5.31. He delivers from the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin. There's no Condemnation to them that are in CHRIST JESUS
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.1.</NOTE>. And from the <HI>Domi∣nion</HI> of it. Sin shall not have Dominion over you: for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6.14.</NOTE>. In CHRIST there is <HI>a Fountain opened</HI> to the House of <HI>David,</HI> and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, <HI>for Sin and Uncleanness.</HI> His <HI>Blood</HI> cleanseth from all Sin, and by his SPIRIT doth he apply the Vertue of it till

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 51.7.</NOTE>. It is true, the Sanctification of GOD's People in this Life is imperfect, 1 Joh. 1.8. <HI>If we say that we have no Sin, we de∣ceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.</HI> However this work shall also be perfected in due time; Eph. 5.25 — 27. <HI>Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify &amp; cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</HI></P>
<P>Again. THE Lord will deliver his People from <HI>Satan.</HI></P>
<P>AND this follows upon the former; By taking away Sin, the SON of GOD destroy'd the Works of the De∣vil, who usurp'd a power over Man by drawing him into a Rebellion against his only Rightful Lord. The Devil is a formidable Enemy to the sinful Children of Men. He is a destroyer, and as a <HI>roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.8. He is the <HI>old Serpent</HI> that stung Mankind to Death even in Paradice by prevailing in his Temptation to Sin, and so rendring them obnoxious to the Curse of the Law. But it was early promis'd that the <HI>Seed of the Woman should bruise his head,</HI> — Gen. 3.15. which Seed is CHRIST, who was made of a Woman in an extraordi∣nary manner, of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the HOLY GHOST coming upon her—
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luk. 1.35.</NOTE> And took part of Flesh &amp; Blood, that he might <HI>destroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil,</HI> Heb. 2.14.

<P>Again, THE Lord will deliver his People from <HI>the Men of this World.</HI></P>
<P>THE Psalmist prays, Psal. 17.13, 14 <HI>Arise O Lord, —deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy Sword: From men which are thy hand, Lord, from men of the World</HI>—. GOD, in his spotless Sovereignty, some∣times makes use of these to chastise his People; but when the <HI>Lord hath perform'd his whole work on mount Zion, He will punish them</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 10.12.</NOTE>. Tho' they as∣sociate themselves, and combine together against the faithful Servants of GOD they shall be broken in pieces. In a little time the Servants of GOD shall be taken to rest where the wicked cease from troubling, and in the Morning of the Resurrection they shall have Dominion over them: <HI>For the Saints shall judge the World,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.2. But I shall not enlarge here.</P>
<P>Again, THE Lord will Save his People from <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE Wages of Sin is Death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. which in the large sense of the word, comprehends <HI>all Evil;</HI> but take it in a more restrained sense, for temporal Death, or the separation of the vital Union between Soul &amp; Body, together with the fore-runners of it, as Sickness, bodily Pain, &amp;c. And it is a fearful Evil. The Scripture calls it the <HI>last Enemy,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.26. So it is to GOD's
<PB N="17" REF="002957_0020_0FE6A5D0D92A6200"/>Children; for the second Death hath no power over them. And the Text but now mentioned assureth us, that even this shall be destroy'd. Our Saviour JESUS CHRIST hath <HI>abolished Death</HI>—, 2 Tim. 1.10. He hath taken away the sting &amp; power of it, and will give his People a compleat Victory at the Resurrection, when the Bodies of the Saints shall be rais'd in Incor∣ruption, in Glory, and in Power; yea shall be <HI>fashion'd like unto his glorious Body,</HI> Phil. 3.20, 21.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Lord will put his People into the full possession of all Good needed to compleat their Eternal Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>THE Great GOD our Saviour is not only a <HI>Shield</HI> to defend his People from <HI>Evil;</HI> but also a <HI>Sun</HI> to sup∣ply them with <HI>Good.</HI> Psal. 84.11. <HI>For the Lord God is a Sun and a shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> GOD in Christ is their shield, and <HI>exceeding great reward.</HI>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. UPON the Whole; <HI>Here we see something of the Divine Majesty, and Excelling Glory of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE words of our Text, as we have heard, may be applied to him, tho' not excluding the other Persons, the Father and the Holy Ghost, which Three are One GOD. Certainly then, our Saviour appears to be very
<PB N="19" REF="002957_0022_0FE6A5D0EF2C2430"/>great, and most worthy to receive Honour and Glory and Blessing.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 5.12.</NOTE> He is the King of Glory, the Lord Strong and Mighty. The Glory of this World is a fading Flower. Death Reigns over Sovereign Princes, and lays their Honor in the Dust. They Die like other Men; yea are often times not suffer'd to con∣tinue so long as others by reason of Death.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the Thirty Kings &amp; Queens which Reigned since <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, not one compleated 70 Years. We now mourn the Death of One that was among the longest Livers of them.</NOTE> But now the Son of GOD Liveth and Reigns for ever. Indeed in the Execution of his Office he died once; but then in our Nature he rose a Conqueror on the Third Day, having abolished Death, and is set down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. Let us then realize the Glory of this Divine Person, who is our Judge and Law-giver, King and Saviour, and glorify him as GOD; for this is the Father's design in investing his Son with these great Offices. John 5.22, 23. <HI>The Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment un∣to the Son: That all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Learn, <HI>THE Honour and Happiness of the Church and People of God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Honour have all the Saints, that Christ is their Lord and Saviour, and they are his friends and favourites.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Joh. 15.15.</NOTE> The Church is the <HI>Bride, the Lamb's wise.</HI> Rev. 21.9, 10. And is represented to us as a <HI>Woman clothed with the Sun,</HI> Rev. 12.1. For she shines in the borrowed rays of her Lord &amp; Husband
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Uxor fulget radiis mariti.</HI></NOTE>, who is the Sun of Righteousness.

And at last shall be presented a glorious Church before Him. For Christ's work is perfect. From hence also we may infer the safety and happiness of the Church. Her Redeemer lives, and therefore the gates of Hell shall not prevail against her, Psal. 46.5. <HI>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.</HI> And how great must her Blessedness be, who is blessed in Christ Jesus, the Almighty Saviour.

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 2.9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LET what hath been said Direct and Com∣fort GOD's People under the great &amp; awful Bereave∣ment which we lament before the Lord this Day.</HI></P>
<P>THE Scriptures of Truth speak of <HI>Kings</HI> as the <HI>Breath of their Subjects nostrils</HI>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lam. 4.20.</NOTE>. Their People do in some sense Live &amp; Breath in them. And therefore, when in the Sovereign Providence of GOD, their <HI>Breath</HI> goeth forth, it becometh their People to humble them∣selves under GOD's mighty Hand stretched out against them. Upon so great an Occasion as this, they may well take up that Lamentation, Lam. 5.16, 17. <HI>The Crown is fallen</HI> —. For this our Heart is faint, our Eyes are dim. And it hath been the commendable Practice of GOD's professing People to Lament the Fall of such whom GOD had set at their Head, in the Civil Government. Thus <HI>David</HI> lamented over <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> 2 Sam. 1.17. <HI>All Judah &amp; Jerusalem mourned for Josiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 35.24.</P>
<P>Now then, The <HI>Lord of Life</HI> calls us to pay our tribute of Tears, and bear our part in the publick Sorrows of this mournful Day, in which the Light of our Israel is quenched, in the very <HI>sudden and sur∣prizing

<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It deserves a thankful Remark, that thro' the good∣ness of GOD, the Peace was so far brought forward before His Majesty's Death.</NOTE>. LORD, We are dumb &amp; open not our Mouths because thou hast done it. Job 9.12. <HI>Behold he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, what doest thou?</HI> Let us then duly resent this awful <HI>Blow</HI> of GOD's hand, and relent un∣der it. Let us Weep over this Great Man; for the <HI>Beauty</HI> of Israel, the <HI>Mighty</HI> is fallen. GOD hath taken from us a KING Renown'd for Wisdom and Council, Courage and Firmness of Mind, Application to Business and Quick Dispatch; a KING whose Accession to the <HI>British Throne</HI> was esteem'd by Wise Discerners of the times, as Life from the Dead to his Dominions, and the Protestant Interest; a KING whom GOD hath highly honour'd in the great Esteem he had given him at Home and Abroad, in his very Extensive Influence, and the mighty things GOD had done for him and by him. But I presume not to draw his <HI>Character;</HI> an attempt too great and high for me. My main design is to make a <HI>Religious Improvement</HI> of this surprising Providence: Hath GOD remov'd our KING in this <HI>Critical Juncture,</HI> when Affairs still look with a dubious Aspect, when the Eyes of so many were upon him, and his People might be ready to say, under his shadow we shall live. Let us then <HI>Cease from Man whose Breath is in his Nostrils.</HI> The Lord now speaks once, yea twice, in his Word and by his Providence, and his Voice to us is that, Psal. 146.3, 4. <HI>Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts
<PB N="22" REF="002957_0025_0FE6A5C7603F10E0"/>perish.</HI> Isa. 2.22. Cease ye from Man, whose breath is in his Nostrils: <HI>for wherein is he to be accounted of.</HI> All Nations before GOD are as nothing, and they are counted to him less then nothing and vanity. GOD holds the breath of the most Mighty Princes in his hand, and can stop it in a Moment. And while they Live they can be no more to us than he is pleased to make them. In vain is Salvation hoped for from these Hills — in the Lord our GOD is the Salvation of his People. And therefore while we give them that honor which is their dne. We must <HI>look off</HI> from them, not trusting in an Arm of Flesh. And on the contrary, <HI>We should look to our Glorious Lord, who is King in Zion, and place our trust in him.</HI> This is our Support that the Lord Omnipotent reigns. The Great GOD our Saviour testifieth, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive forever more,</HI> Amen; and have the Keys of Hell
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or the invisible World, <HI>Hades.</HI></NOTE> and of Death. O let us then lift up our Eyes unto him from whom cometh our help, and put our trust under his shadow. For of this King it may truly be said as, Isa. 32.2. <HI>A man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest: as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</HI> O Afflicted People of GOD! fly for refuge to lay hold on the Hope set before you in your Saviour, who is the Mighty GOD, the Everlasting Father, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.6.

<P>AND now, <HI>Let us Praise the Lord, who hath not left his British-Israel, as Sheep without a Shepherd.</HI> Here is light arising to us under our darkness: GOD hath Ordained a Lamp to his Servant, a Son and Successor, and that not a Child; but a Prince in his full Strength for Council and Action. Blessed be GOD, the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> in the Illustrious House of HANOVER <HI>abides</HI> before him. The KING lives in
<PB N="23" REF="002957_0026_0FE6A5D37388D730"/>his SON, and we behold our rightful and lawful KING <HI>GEORGE</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> whom GOD long Pre∣serve! peaceably seated on his Throne. amidst the joyful Acclamations of his dutiful People; yea we hear Him declaring from the Throne, That the <HI>Re∣ligion, Laws &amp; Liberties of the Kingdom are most dear to Him.</HI> We also with pleasure behold him Blessed of GOD with a most <HI>gracious QUEEN,</HI> who is truly a <HI>Crown</HI> to her <HI>Husband,</HI> and by whom He is strengthned with a <HI>Royal Offspring,</HI> Our <HI>Hope,</HI> GOD grant they may be the <HI>Joy</HI> of Posterity.

The LORD give his Servant an understanding Heart to Judge his People, that he may go out and come in before them, doing Justice and Judgment. The LORD make him truly the Defender of the Faith, a nursing Father to his Church &amp; People. The LORD preserve his Servant from all secret Attempts and open Violence. Cloath his Enemies with shame; but upon himself let his Crown flourish.</P>
<P>AND may his Subjects be of one heart to Fear GOD and honour the KING. In his Days let the Righteous flourish, and abundance of Peace.</P>
<P>AND may the <HI>benign Influences</HI> of his Govern∣ment <HI>reach his loyal People in these Ends of the Earth,</HI> come down upon us like Ram upon the mown Grass: as showers that Water the Earth. May we also sit under His shadow in the continued Enjoyment of our Privileges Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical, who have ever express'd our Joy in the Prosperity of his most serene House. LORD we look unto thee who hast the KING's Heart in thy Hand. <HI>Save Lord, and let the King hear us when we call.</HI></P>
<P>MAY the <HI>most High</HI> choose our <HI>Changes</HI> in great Mercy, and give such from time to time to Rule
<PB N="24" REF="002957_0027_0FE6A5C788F18148"/>over us, as shall be Just, Ruling in the Fear of GOD: that under them we may lead quiet &amp; peaceable Lives in all godliness &amp; honesty.

<P>IN a word, <HI>Let Civil Rulers realize their Mor∣tality,</HI> and Act under this view that they must short∣ly be call'd to give up their Account to GOD the Judge of all. Psal. 82.6, 7. <HI>I have said, ye are gods — but ye shall die like Men.</HI> Be entreated therefore to glorify that GOD in whose Hand your Breath is, and whose are all your ways.

Serve ye the Lord wieh fear, and rejoyce with trembling.

<P>AND let us all be <HI>Exhorted to Accept of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>as offer'd in the Gospel, and to live in Obe∣dience to his Laws;</HI> for HE is <HI>the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</HI> Heb. 5.9.
