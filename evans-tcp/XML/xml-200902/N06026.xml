<P>AS the following little <HI>Poem</HI> discovers a Degree of <HI>Judgment, Genius</HI> and <HI>Public-Spirit</HI> seldom to be met with in Persons so young as the Author, it was thought that the Publication of it might be seasonable at this Time, as well to contri∣bute towards the Healing our unhappy Breaches, as to encourage the Author to Attempts of an higher Nature. The Piece has been perused by some Per∣sons of acknowledged Taste, and is recommended to the Candor of the discerning Reader, who will be pleased to find the Author in several Places rising by <HI>manly Imitation</HI> to the Beauties of some of our <HI>ablest Masters,</HI> whom he keeps before him.</P>

<HEAD>PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE ruthless WAR strides o'er th' ensanguin'd Plain,</L>
<L>And lawless Rapine, Slavery, Death and Bonds,</L>
<L>Her direful Train, stalk horrible around;</L>
<L>While Home-bred <HI>Faction</HI> rends the sinking State,</L>
<L>And <HI>Discord,</HI> Hell-born Fiend, triumphant reigns;</L>
<L>O let the peaceful MUSE, whose tender Years</L>
<L>Ill brook this savage, rude, tumultuous Scene,</L>
<L>Retire awhile, and seek with anxious Eye</L>
<L>If haply she may find a calm Retreat,</L>
<L>Where in the Covert of some bowery Grove</L>
<L><HI>Peace</HI> dwells with Shade and Silence, Sisters mild!</L>
<L>There vent her inward Grief in plaintive Strains</L>
<L>And tell the listening Gloom her Country's Wo</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LED by my roving Thoughts full oft I stray</L>
<L>With measur'd Step along thy pebbled Shore,</L>
<L>O <HI>Delaware!</HI> whose silver-winding Wave,</L>
<L>Majestic rolling thro' a Length of Soil,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="007648_0004_102DB7D70304F6E8"/>
Visits the secret Haunts and deep Abodes</L>
<L>Of many a King and Queen of various Hue,</L>
<L>Whose artless Shoulders unadorn'd and plain</L>
<L>Groan not beneath the Load of regal State!</L>
<L>There lonely wandering on, I pensive court</L>
<L>Thy murm'ring Tide to sooth my Heart-felt Pain;</L>
<L>How sweet is Solitude, the secret Walk,</L>
<L>The gloomy, deepening Shade, and silent Hour,</L>
<L>To Him, whose Soul unruffled and serene</L>
<L>Can view with social Pity and Concern</L>
<L>The Feuds and Factions of a jarring World!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ONE Evening mild, as at my wonted Hour</L>
<L>I walk'd the Margin of my native Stream,</L>
<L>Musing of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Just,</HI> the sacred Themes</L>
<L>That thro' the Day, devolv'd from STREPHON'S Tongue,</L>
<L>Had charm'd my listening Ear—I chanc'd to stray</L>
<L>Where KENSINGTON her growing Honours spreads,</L>
<L>And views her Features in the chrystal Wave;</L>
<L>Strait with a Flood of Glory compass'd round</L>
<L>A Form celestial struck my dazled Sense;</L>
<L>In her majestic Mien, her Looks divine,</L>
<L>And graceful rich Attire, the Goddess shone;</L>
<L>And PENNSYLVANIA'S Genius stood confest.</L>
<L>But tho' surrounded with th' effulgent Blaze,</L>
<L>Her down-cast Eye and Tresses discompos'd</L>
<L>Some inward Discontent and Anguish spoke.</L>
<L>Torn from her Brow the peaceful Olive lay</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="007648_0005_102D7405C19307C8"/>
All wither'd and neglected at her Feet.</L>
<L>Her Right Hand grasp'd the dreaded Spear of MARS,</L>
<L>And on her Left MINERVA'S Aegis hung.</L>
<L>Pensive and sad she fix'd her Eyes on thee,</L>
<L>Fair PHILADELPHIA! Offspring of her Toil;</L>
<L>And thus, with many a mingled Heart-fetch'd Sigh,</L>
<L>In Accent mild, she spoke, or seem'd to speak:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND is it thus my Cares are recompens'd?</L>
<L>Is this the Issue of my anxious Toils?—</L>
<L>To see this fertile Soil, this sacred Spot,</L>
<L>My fair Inheritance, the calm Abode</L>
<L>Of Peace and Virtue, Liberty and Law,</L>
<L>Laid waste and ravag'd by a cruel Foe!</L>
<L>To see my bleeding Sons, like blasted Plants,</L>
<L>Falling beneath the Ruffian Murderer's Hand!—</L>
<L>And not one Arm uplifted to assert</L>
<L>The pious Cause, avenge their guiltless Blood,</L>
<L>And hurl Destruction on an impious Race!—</L>
<L>Was it for <HI>this</HI> I left my native Soil,</L>
<L>Thee, great BRITANNIA! Mistress of the Main!</L>
<L>And sought these distant Shores then far remote</L>
<L>From the sweet Influence of thy temper'd Rule;</L>
<L>To spread thy Sway, and give this fruitful Land</L>
<L>A fair Accession to thy wide Domain?</L>
<L>Was it for <HI>this</HI> I plann'd the Scheme of State,</L>
<L>A Constitution just, impartial, free;</L>
<L>And gave my Sons to know the ruling Art,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="007648_0006_102DB7DADE566F08"/>
To ballance fair the Legislative Pow'rs,</L>
<L>And teach the <HI>Free-born</HI> Subject <HI>Freedom</HI>'s Laws?</L>
<L>Was it for <HI>this</HI> I bade the teeming Earth</L>
<L>Pour from its Bosom the luxuriant Crop,</L>
<L>To crown with smiling Plenty, Wealth and Ease,</L>
<L>The vig'rous Labours of my hardy Swains?</L>
<L>Was it for <HI>this</HI> I bade each useful <HI>Art,</HI></L>
<L>Each Heav'n-born <HI>Science</HI> spread their Blessings round,</L>
<L>And taught my rising Sons bright <HI>Wisdom</HI>'s Lore?</L>
<L>For <HI>this</HI> I toil'd with all a Mother's Care,</L>
<L>And rais'd by Patriot-Deeds my Infant State?—</L>
<L>To see at last the proud Usurper's Arm</L>
<L>Outstretch'd, in Act to seize by brutal Force,</L>
<L>And Rapine base my just and righteous Claim;</L>
<L>Myself, despairing yet of brighter Days,</L>
<L>Constrain'd to drink the bitter Cup of Woe!—</L>
<L>Great my Misfortunes now, as erst my Bliss!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AVENGING Justice! whither art thou fled!</L>
<L>That thus the lawless Sons of Rapine act</L>
<L>In base Defiance of thy Sovereign Pow'r!</L>
<L>Oh come! and arm'd with thy vindictive Sword</L>
<L>Pour ample Ruin on their guilty Heads!</L>
<L>For their heap'd Crimes the Retribution just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AH! what a Train of complicated Woes</L>
<L>In black Succession pass before my View,</L>
<L>Whene'er I turn my Eyes to yonder Plains?</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="007648_0007_102DB7DD05F442F0"/>
Where in soft Murmurs thro' the verdant Soil</L>
<L>MONONGAHELA rolls his gentle Tide.</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> doom'd to perish in a glorious Cause</L>
<L>Full many a gallant Youth and Veteran bold,</L>
<L>BRITANNIA'S hardy Sons, with BRADDOCK lie,</L>
<L>The hapless Partners of a Lot severe!</L>
<L>Great Chiefs, in Arms renown'd, in Suffering brave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FLUSH'D with the Daring of their bold Emprize,</L>
<L>And fir'd with Thirst of Blood, and sordid Gain,</L>
<L>The Sons of FRANCE, in Council dark conven'd</L>
<L>Sternly resolve their Conquest to pursue.</L>
<L>And <HI>now</HI> send forth their gloomy painted Tribes,</L>
<L>Those human Monsters of the Desart wild!—</L>
<L>A dismal Prelude to their black Designs!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND shall my Sons, a numerous Race robust,</L>
<L>With ill-tim'd, base Forbearance tamely brook</L>
<L>This savage Treatment from a treacherous Foe?—</L>
<L>And have you then forgot your high Descent,</L>
<L>The peerless Fame of your illustrious Line</L>
<L>Renown'd of old, from great BRITANNIA sprung?—</L>
<L>For sure I am, the Queen of Nations bore</L>
<L>Me, your presiding <HI>Genius,</HI> and uprear'd</L>
<L>Her PENNSYLVANIA with a Mother's Care;</L>
<L>Fair as the fairest of her beauteous Race,</L>
<L>And bless'd with equal Honour, Wealth and Strength.</L>
<L>And will you then my Sons, my much-lov'd Race!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="007648_0008_102DB7DFE7493C58"/>
For whom I toil'd so many a rolling Year,</L>
<L>At last degenerate from your pristine Worth,</L>
<L>And level all a Mother's tow'ring Hopes?</L>
<L>Why is the ruthless Sword of Vengeance sheath'd?</L>
<L>Why careless sleeps the <HI>British</HI> Lion bold,</L>
<L>Nor threats Destruction with his lifted Paw?</L>
<L>Ah say, what means this Lethargy supine,</L>
<L>Whose baleful Influence lulls th' inactive Land?—</L>
<L>Is there no daring, martial Spirit here?</L>
<L>No dauntless Breast to rouze my slumbering Sons,</L>
<L>And guide their Strength combin'd against the Foe?—</L>
<L>O for some bold intrepid Son of MARS,</L>
<L>A God-like MARLBOROUGH, or a brave EUGENE!</L>
<L>To train my docile Race to Arms and War,</L>
<L>And lead them forth to Deeds of martial Fame.</L>
<L>Then should I see the haughty <HI>Gallic</HI> Troops,</L>
<L>With their confederate <HI>Indians</HI> black and fierce</L>
<L>All routed fly before my conquering Sword.</L>
<L>Then should I see well-pleas'd the <HI>British</HI> Flag</L>
<L>Triumphant rear'd on fair OHIO'S Banks,</L>
<L>And proud DU QUESNE laid level with the Dust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR blame, my Sons, these earnest Words sincere,</L>
<L>Nor call my Zeal ill-tim'd or idly warm!—</L>
<L>Ah should the base, insulting Foe presume</L>
<L>O'er yonder Hills to march their hostile Bands,</L>
<L>Lay waste the Labours of th' industrious Swain,</L>
<L>And whelm the Country in a general Blaze;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="007648_0009_102DB7E246340EF8"/>
Tear from the bleeding Mother's fondling Arms</L>
<L>The wailing Babe, and in its guiltless Breast</L>
<L>With Hand inhuman plunge the reeking Blade;</L>
<L>Then, urg'd with Hope of Gain, in dread Array</L>
<L>Bear all their Terrors to your trembling Gates;—</L>
<L>Or should the gloomy <HI>War-Ship,</HI> arm'd and mann'd,</L>
<L>Full on your Front her thundering Cannon play,</L>
<L>And ceaseless hurl the fierce, destructive Bomb,</L>
<L>To raze my PHILADELPHIA'S towery Pride;</L>
<L>Ah then too late you may at last lament</L>
<L>Your blasted Laurels and your faded Fame;</L>
<L>Too late repent you of your long Neglect,</L>
<L>Your tame Forbearance, and ungenerous Ease;</L>
<L>And deem my Counsels wise, and just my Zeal,</L>
<L>Too late alas! when all is sunk and lost!</L>
<L>Then rouze at once, nor let th' impending Storm</L>
<L>That gathers fast, and frowns with boding Brow,</L>
<L>Burst unresisted on this prostrate Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET ere I close—one racking Thought disturbs</L>
<L>My anxious Bosom, and alarms me more</L>
<L>Than all the Terrors of a foreign War.</L>
<L>Still shall the <HI>Gallic</HI> Tyrant uncontroul'd</L>
<L>Spread wide his Conquests thro' my fair Domain,</L>
<L>And still persist in Violation base</L>
<L>Of perfect Rights, and Treaties sacred held;</L>
<L>While restless Party-Rage divides your Strength,</L>
<L>And Feuds intestine rend your infant State.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="007648_0010_102DB7E5856F4028"/>
Where shall I find some generous healing Hand</L>
<L>Of dextrous Skill, and honest, friendly Views,</L>
<L>By calm, impartial Reason, and the Tongue</L>
<L>Of soft Perswasion, to close up the Breach</L>
<L>That Discord makes between my jarring Sons?</L>
<L>What means, ah say, what means this Phrenzy dire</L>
<L>That spreads and burns in every rankled Breast?</L>
<L>Rouze, rouze, my Sons, nor weigh in equal Scale</L>

<L>Those of inferior Worth;—but <HI>know</HI> betimes,</L>
<L>And dearly prize, th' unconquerable Force</L>
