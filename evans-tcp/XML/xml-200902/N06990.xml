<L>WHAT means that Lock of Woe, that Head reclin'd,</L>
<L>Those folded Arms, with which I meet <HI>Amyntor?</HI></L>
<L>That Eye which wont, with Love and sparkling Joy,</L>
<L>To beam, munificent, on ev'ry Friend,</L>
<L>Why bends it thus in Sorrow to the Ground,</L>
<L>As if no View could please but Dust and Earth?</L>

<SPEAKER>AMYNTOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>All Things, <HI>Eugenio,</HI> are but Dust and Earth!</L>
<L>Even Kings themselves—those Demi-gods enthron'd,</L>
<L>Rulers of Empire, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of War,</L>
<L>At whose avenging Nod the guilty tremble,</L>
<L>Nations are doom'd, and Millions live or die—</L>
<L>Even Kings themselves—are nought but Dust and Earth!</L>

<L>Who knows not that <HI>Amyntor?</HI> But why damp</L>

<L>What festive Day, can <HI>Britain</HI> or her Sons</L>

<L>From Pole to Pole, far as old Ocean heaves</L>
<L>His troubled Wave, and bears the <HI>British</HI> Flag,</L>
<L>The Voice of Woe is heard. Even here, remote,</L>
<L>The awful Genius of these barbarous Woods,</L>
<L>That went to Roam from <HI>Indian</HI> Height to Height,</L>
<L>With Nature's Self, in Frolic ever new,</L>
<L>Tears from his hoary Head his feathery Crown,</L>
<L>And breaks his Arrows, and his Quiver rends.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGENIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>In mystic Words, and metaphoric Strains,</L>
<L>Why would <HI>Amyntor</HI> strive to hide the Cause</L>
<L>Of such unbounded Sorrow?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMYNTOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, <HI>Eugenio!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Amyntor</HI> would not hide, but speak the Cause,</L>
<L>Could Words be found to measure forth his Grief,</L>
<L>And ease his labouring Breast. The godlike GEORGE,</L>
