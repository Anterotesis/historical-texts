<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Knowledge of the History of any Society is very necessary to direct the Governors of it, how to conduct with Wisdom, Uniformity and Justice; and may be useful and entertaining to many Others.</P>
<P>At the Desire of the Reverend Trustees of this Col∣lege, in the Year <HI>1744,</HI> I compiled the Substance of this History, to that Time; which was read and ap∣proved by them.—It was collected principally from the Records and original Papers; but several Circum∣stances, tending to set the Whole in a clear Light, I received from sundry Gentlemen, who were contempo∣rary with the Facts related; among which were some of the Founders of the College, with whom I was per∣sonally acquainted in the Year <HI>1726.</HI></P>
<P>As my principal Design, in writing this History, was to preserve these important Facts from Oblivion, and to transmit them down, for the Use of Posterity; I have confined myself to the proper Province of an Historian; which is to give a just and simple Narra∣tion of Facts, without interspersing many Embellish∣ments, Observations or Reflections; leaving them to be made by the judicious and candid Reader.</P>
<P>And since the Want of a certain and exact Know∣ledge of some ancient Facts, has oftentimes been the Occasion of Controversies and Disputes, I have been more minute in the Relation of some Circumstantials, than may probably be entertaining to Strangers; yet not more than may, hereafter, be really necessary, for those who will be immediately concerned.</P>
<P><PB REF="010262_0003_0F7E250FF8E29770"/>I have digested this History in the Form of <HI>ANNALS,</HI> as supposing that the chronological Order will be most easily understood and remembered: Yet, sometimes, where Things are necessarily connected, I have put them into the same Paragraph, altho' they occurred in different Years.</P>
<P>The greater Part of this History being wrote when the Paper-Currency of <HI>New-England</HI> was in a de∣preciating State, it was thought best that all Sums of Money should be reduced to the <HI>Sterling</HI> Value. — The College-Accounts, before the Year <HI>1726,</HI> are somewhat obscure; and therefore it is probable that some Receipts and Disbursements of Money, before that Time, have not come to my Knowledge; yet, since that Time, they stand very fair and clear.</P>
<P>To render this History the more complete, I have recited or referred to all the Acts of the Honorable the General Assembly, relating to the College.</P>
<P>I had Thoughts of adding something upon the civil and ecclesiastical Privileges of Colleges and Universi∣ties, but shall only refer the Reader to those Authors who have wrote largely on that Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> — Dr. <HI>Ayliffe</HI>'s ancient and present State of the University of <HI>Oxford; Wood</HI>'s Institutes of the common Law; Bp. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>'s Discourse in the House of Lords; <HI>Conringius,</HI> de Antiquitatibus Academicis; and a short Piece I printed, in the Year <HI>1754,</HI> entitled <HI>The Religious Constitution of Colleges.</HI></P>
<P>I have made Minutes of several other Things, which may be useful to Some; and may hereafter pre∣pare Materials for the Continuation of this History.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1698</NOTE>The Design of founding a College in the Colony of Connecticut, was first concerted by the Ministers; among which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pierpont</HI> of <HI>New Haven,</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> of <HI>Milford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> of <HI>Branford,</HI> were the most forward and active. They had sundry Meetings and Consultations, and received several Pro∣posals or Schemes relating to the Constitution and Regu∣lation of such a College. The first Plan was very for∣mal and minute, drawn up by some Gentleman in Imi∣tation of the Protestant Colleges and Universities in France, founded by their general Synods. <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Quick's Synodicon in Gallia Reformata.</NOTE> In which it was proposed, <Q>That a College should be erected by a general Synod of the <HI>consociated Churches</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> I. Mather, <HI>in his</HI> Order of the Gospel, <HI>says, That</HI> a Consociation of Churches, has ever been the Profession and Practice of those who have been called Congregationalists. <HI>The Churches in</HI> Connecticut, <HI>from the Be∣ginning were wont to Consociate upon special Emergencies: more frequently, after the Synod at</HI> Boston <HI>in the Year</HI> 1662: <HI>and in a more fixed and stated Manner, after the Synod at</HI> Saybrook, 1708.</NOTE> in the Colony of Connecticut. To be under the Govern∣ment of a President and ten Inspectors or Trustees, any seven of them to be a Quorum. That the Synod should nominate the first President and Inspectors, and should have some kind of Influence in all future Elec∣tions, so far as should be necessary, to preseve Ortho∣doxy in the Governors. That the Synod should agree upon a Confession of Faith to be consented to by the President, Inspectors and Tutors. That the College should be called the <HI>School of the Church.</HI> And that the Churches should contribute towards it's Support.</Q>
<PB N="3" REF="010262_0006_0F7E25119D2CFE80"/>
<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Accordingly there was a general Contribution in <HI>1703.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. There was no publick Motion for the calling of a formal Synod, for that Purpose, till three Years after; but in the mean Time, in the lesser Conventions of Ministers in Associations and Councils, and in private Conversation, ten of the principal Ministers in the Co∣lony, were nominated and agreed upon by a general<NOTE PLACE="marg">1699</NOTE> Consent both of the Ministers and People, to stand as Trustees or Undertakers to found, erect and govern a College, viz.

<P>The Ministers so nominated, met at <HI>New-Haven</HI> and formed themselves into a Body or Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE> to consist of eleven Ministers, including a Rector, and agreed to Found a College in the Colony of Connecticut; which they did at their next Meeting at <HI>Branford,</HI> in the fol∣lowing Manner, viz. Each Member brought a Num∣ber of Books and presented them to the Body; and laying them on the Table, said these Words, or to this Effect; <HI>"I give these Books for the founding a College in this Colony."</HI> Then the Trustees as a Body took Pos∣session of them; and appointed the Rev. Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> of <HI>Branford</HI> to be the Keeper of the Library, which then consisted of about 40 Volumes in Folio. Soon after they received sundry other Donations both of Books and
<PB N="4" REF="010262_0007_0F7E2512C9C03740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE>Money, which laid a good Foundation. This Library with the Additions, was kept at <HI>Branford,</HI> in a Room set apart for that Purpose near three Years, and then it was carried to <HI>Killingworth.</HI></P>
<P>But afterwards some began to doubt whether they were fully vested with a legal Capacity to hold Lands, and whether private Donations and Contributions would yield a Sufficiency to carry on so great a Design; it was therefore proposed to make Application to the Hon. the General Assembly of the Colony for some Assistance; and to ask for a <HI>Charter.</HI> The Expediency of this Propo∣sal was debated at several Meetings; and sundry Argu∣ments were used on both Sides: and some of the ablest Lawyers both in, and out of the Government, were consulted upon it. After mature Consideration, they concluded that it was safe and best to have a Charter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1701</NOTE>notwithstanding any Change of the Government which might possibly happen; and wrote to the Hon. Judge <HI>Sewall,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Addington</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> to prepare a Draught of a Charter, to be presented to the next As∣sembly.</P>
<P>Whereupon a large Number of Ministers and others, drew up and signed a Petition to the Hon. the General Assembly, representing, <Q>That from a sincere Regard to, and Zeal for, upholding the Protestant Religion, by a Succession of learned and orthodox Men, they had proposed that a Collegiate School should be erect∣ed in this Colony, wherein Youth should be instructed in all Parts of Learning, to qualify them for publick Employments in Church and Civil State; and that they had nominated ten Ministers to be Trustees, Part∣ners or Undertakers for the Founding, Endowing and Ordering the said School, viz. The Rev. Mr. <HI>James Noyes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Israel Chauncy</HI> and the rest before mentioned And thereupon desired that <HI>full</HI> Liberty and Privilege might be granted to the said Underta∣kers for that End.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010262_0008_0F7E251340784CE0"/>And in Order to facilitate the Design, <HI>James Fitch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1701</NOTE> of <HI>Norwich <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> one of the Council, soon after the As∣sembly met, made a formal Donation under his Hand, predicated upon <Q>the great Pains and Charge which the Ministers had been at in setting up a Collegiate School; and therefore in order to encourage a Work so pleasing to God, and beneficial to Posterity, he gave a Tract of Land in <HI>Killingly,</HI> of about 600 Acres; and all the Glass and Nails which should be necessary to build a College House and Hall: and promised to give a more ample Conveyance of the Land, as soon as it could be resurveyed.</Q></P>
<P>The Petition being presented to the Hon. Assembly, they appeared very ready to encourage such a laudable and pious Design, and accordingly established the Act or Charter drawn up by Mr. Secretary <HI>Addington,</HI> with some small Additions and Alterations, which is as fol∣lows, viz.</P>

<P>Whereas it was the glorious publick Design of our now blessed Fathers, in their Remove from <HI>Europe</HI> into these Parts of <HI>America,</HI> both to plant, and (under the Divine Blessing) to propagate in this Wilderness the blessed reformed Protestant Religion, in the Purity of its Order and Worship; not only to their Posterity, but also to the barbarous Natives: In which great Enterprize they wanted not the Royal Commands and Favour of his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to authorize and invigorate them.</P>
<P>We their unworthy Posterity, lamenting our past Neglects of this grand Errand, and sensible of the equal Obligations, better to prosecute the same End, are desirous in our Generation to be serviceable thereunto.</P>
<P>Whereunto the religious and liberal Education of suit∣able Youth is, under the Blessing of God, a chief and most probable Expedient. Therefore, that we might not be wanting in cherishing the present observable and pious Disposition of many well-minded People, to dedicate their Children and Substance unto God in such a good Service: And being ourselves, with sun∣dry other Reverend Elders, not only desired by our Godly People, to undertake as Trustees, for erecting, forming, ordering and regulating a Collegiate School,
<PB N="10" REF="010262_0013_0F7E2516EF748F40"/>
for the Advancement of such an Education: But hav∣ing also obtained of our present religious Government, both full Liberty and Assistance, by their Donations to such an Use: Tokens likewise that particular Per∣sons will not be wanting in their Beneficence: Do, in Duty to God, and the Weal of our Country, undertake in the aforesaid Design. And being now met, accord∣ing to the Liberties and Aids granted to us for the Use aforesaid; do order and appoint, that there shall be, and hereby is erected and formed a Collegiate School, wherein shall be taught the liberal Arts and Languages, in such Place or Places in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> as the said Trustees with their Associates and Successors, do or shall, from Time to Time, see Cause to order.</P>
<P>For the orderly and effectual Management of this Affair, we agree to and hereby appoint and confirm the following RULES.</P>
<P>1st, That the Rector take special Care, as of the moral Behaviour of the Students at all Times, so with Industry, to instruct and ground them well in Theo∣retical Divinity; and to that End, shall neither by himself, nor by any other Person whomsoever, allow them to be instructed and grounded in any <HI>other System or Synopsis of Divinity,</HI> than such as the said Trustees do order and appoint: But shall take effec∣tual Care, that the said Students be weekly (at such Seasons as he shall see Cause to appoint) caused me∣moriter to recite the Assembly's Catechism in Latin, and <HI>Ames</HI>'s Theological Theses, of which, as also <HI>Ames</HI>'s <HI>Cases of Conscience,</HI> he shall make, or cause to be made, from Time to Time, such Explanations as may (through the Blessing of God,) be most conducive to their Establishment in the Principles of the Christian Protestant Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The Rector shall also cause the Scripture
<PB N="11" REF="010262_0014_0F7E25179631CEF8"/>
daily (except on the Sabbath) Morning and Evening, to be read by the Students at the Times of Prayer in the School, according to the laudable Order and Usage of <HI>Harvard College,</HI> making Expositions upon the same: And upon the Sabbath, shall either Ex∣pound practical Theology, or cause the non-graduated Students to repeat Sermons: And in all other Ways according to his best Discretion, shall at all Times studiously endeavour in the Education of the Students, to <HI>promote the Power and purity of Religion, and the best Edification of these</HI> New-England Churches.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>With sundry other Rules and Orders for the Regula∣tion of the said School.</P>
<P>The Trustees chose the Rev. Mr. Abraham Pierson, who was one of their Number, to take the Care of Instructing and Governing the Collegiate School; un∣der the Title and Character of RECTOR.</P>
<P>And in as much as it was originally proposed that there should be ten Trustees besides the <HI>Rector,</HI> they <Q>chose the Rev. Mr. Samuel Russel, of Branford, to be a Trustee to complete the Number of Eleven.</Q></P>
<P>At the same Meeting, they entered upon the Conside∣ration of the most convenient <HI>Place</HI> in the Colony of Connecticut, in which they might erect and fix the Collegiate School: they were not perfectly satisfied or united in it; but after a considerable Debate they fixed upon <HI>Saybrook,</HI> as the most convenient Place, <HI>at Present; unless upon further Consideration they should alter their Minds:</HI> And this Matter was debated at several Meet∣ings afterwards.</P>
<P>They also desired the Rector to remove himself and Family to <HI>Saybrook;</HI> but till that could be effected, they ordered that the Scholars should be instructed at or near the Rector's House in <HI>Killingworth.</HI> As this School
<PB N="12" REF="010262_0015_0F7E2518A4D3A490"/>
was some Years in forming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1702</NOTE> several young Gentlemen were preparing for it under the more private Instruc∣tion of some one of the Trustees or others: After the School became furnished with a Rector and a Tutor, eight of them were admitted, and put into different Classes, according to the proficiency they had antece∣dently made. So that in a Year or two some were qua∣lified for Degrees.</P>
<P>The first Commencement was held at Saybrook, on Sept. 13th, 1702. at which four young Gentlemen, who had before been graduated at the College at Cam∣bridge, and one more, who had a private Education, received the Degrees of Master of Arts. This and se∣veral Commencements following were held privately in the House of the Rev. Mr. Buckingham, because the Trustees by a preceding Act, had forbid all publick Commencements; to avoid the Charge and other In∣conveniences attending them.</P>
<P>Mr. Nathaniel Lynde of Saybrook, was pleased ge∣nerously to give a House and Land for the Use of the Collegiate School, so long as it should be continued at <HI>Saybrook.</HI> And James Fitch, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in pursuance of his generous Donation made in October last, gave an ample Deed of 637 Acres of Land at Killingly. There was also a general Contribution throughout the Co∣lony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703</NOTE> to build a College House at Saybrook, or where∣ever the College should be finally fixed: But we have no Account what was obtained by it.</P>
<P>The Trustees had a special Meeting at <HI>Guilford,</HI> March 17th, 1703, and wrote a Circular Letter to the Ministers, proposing "to have a general Synod of all the Churches in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to give their joint Consent to
<PB N="13" REF="010262_0016_0F7E25191BC05AD8"/>
the <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> after the Example of the Synod in <HI>Boston,</HI> in 1680." This Proposal being universally ac∣ceptable, the Churches in the several Counties met in a consociated Council, and assented to the <HI>Westminster</HI> or <HI>Savoy</HI> Confessions; and drew up some Rules of Ec∣clesiastical Discipline; as Matters preparatory to the Synod. Then each Council chose six Delegates, that is, three Ministers and three Messengers, to meet in a general Synod. This Synod met at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> in 1708: And having compared the several Draughts of the Councils in each County, unanimously agreed in these three general Acts.</P>
<P N="1">Ist. They drew up and consented to <HI>a Confession of Faith;</HI> which is the same in Substance, and nearly in the same Words with the <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> Confessions.</P>
<P N="2">IId. They consented to the general Plan of Eccle∣siastical Government, contained in <HI>the Heads of Agree∣ment assented to, by the united Ministers, in England, for∣merly called Presbyterian and Congregational.</HI></P>
<P N="3">IIIdly. They drew up some particular <HI>Articles and Rules for the Administration of Church Discipline.</HI> The Substance of which (so far as they seemed to contain any Thing new) was this, that whereas in former Times the Boundaries of the several Councils of Churches Consociated for mutual Assistance, were <HI>unfixed,</HI> and left in the general Terms of the <HI>Neighbouring Churches.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Cambridge Platform, Chap.

Synod at Boston, <HI>1662.</HI></NOTE> Now the several Neighbourhoods of Churches were more precisely bounded, and limited to the respective <HI>Counties</HI> or <HI>Districts.</HI> These Acts of the Synod were established by the Laws of the civil Government: And are called the <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitu∣tion of the Churches of the Colony of Connecticut:</HI> And are frequently referred to in the Acts of the Trustees; ac∣cording to the original Plan of the College, menti∣oned in Page 2d.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010262_0017_0F7E2519D3E5DB58"/>The Trustees made several Essays to remove the Rector, with his Family, to <HI>Saybrook,</HI> and proposed to give him 50 Pounds Sterling, to bear the Charges of his Removal, and 60 Pounds Sterling Salary per Annum. But as this Encouragement was but small, and his Removal was strongly opposed by his People, and many of the Trustees were not so well satisfied in fixing the College at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> as to act with so much Vigour as otherwise they would have done; his Re∣moval was never effected; but the Students continued at <HI>Killingworth</HI> till his Death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707</NOTE> which was in April 1707, to the unspeakable Grief and Loss both of the College and of his People.</P>
<P>He was educated at Harvard College and graduated there Anno. 1668; was a hard Student, a good Scho∣lar, a great Divine, and a wise, steady and judicious Gentleman in all his Conduct: He was for many Years a faithful and well respected Pastor of the Church in Killingworth, and after he was chosen Rector, he instructed and governed the Infant College with gene∣ral Approbation; and composed a System of Natural Philosophy, which the Students recited for many Years.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of Mr. Rector Pierson, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> of <HI>Milford,</HI> was chosen Rector pro Tem∣pore, until one could be obtained who should reside at the Collegiate School. Upon which the Senior Class were removed to Milford, to be under his im∣mediate Care and Instruction till the Commencement. The rest of the Students were removed to Saybrook, and put under the Care of two Tutors.</P>
<P>The Tutors and Students being now about twenty in Number, resided and boarded in private Houses, where they could be best accommodated. And the Students
<PB N="15" REF="010262_0018_0F7E251CBB244240"/>
every Day came to their Tutors Chambers to Recita∣tions and Prayers: Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> moderated at the Commencements, and sometimes gave or sent Direc∣tions to the Tutors, in special Cases: But inasmuch as he lived at a great Distance, Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> of <HI>Saybrook,</HI> one of the Trustees, (while he lived) was sub∣stituted to have some Kind of Inspection over the Tu∣tors and Students. In this obscure State the College continued at <HI>Saybrook</HI> about seven Years, without any remarkable Occurrent or Alteration. And the Trus∣tees not being fully agreed or satisfied in their own Minds about the Place of the College; and their In∣comes being scarce sufficient to settle and support a Resident Rector; they made no considerable Attempts to procure one in all that space of Time.</P>
<P>About this Time sundry Donations of valuable Books were made to the Library,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713</NOTE> particularly by Sir <HI>John Davie,</HI> of <HI>Groton,</HI> who had an Estate descended to him in <HI>England,</HI> together with the Title of Baronet: Upon his going to England, he sent a good Collec∣tion of Books to the Library.</P>
<P>But the greatest Donation of all was by the Gene∣rosity and Procurement of <HI>Jeremiah Dummer,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Boston,</HI> then Agent at <HI>London,</HI> who in the Year 1714 sent above 800 Volumes of very valuable Books; about 120 of which were at his own Cost and Charge; and the rest by his Procurement from sundry princi∣pal Gentlemen in England; particularly Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bently,</HI> Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI> severally gave a Collection of their own Works, and Governor <HI>Yale</HI> put in about 40 Vo∣lumes: All which I suppose to be worth 260 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010262_0019_0F7E251D319A97D8"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">1714</NOTE>The Trustees and the Colony in general were from the Beginning, not very well agreed in their Senti∣ments about the Place where to fix the College; and most Men's Sentiments were influenced by their Situ∣ation; and they generally chose that Place which would best accommodate themselves. Three or four Places were generally discoursed upon viz. <HI>Saybrook, Hew-Haven,</HI> and <HI>Hartford</HI> or <HI>Weathersfield.</HI> The Scho∣lars were also somewhat uneasy at their Situation, they thought that Saybrook was not compact enough for their Accommodation, since many of them were obliged to reside above a Mile from the Place of publick Ex∣ercises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1715</NOTE> and they were not pleased with their Instruction and Government; there being no resident Rector, and the Tutors sometimes very young. Many of the Students therefore, having manifested an Uneasiness and Disrespect towards their Tutors; the Trustees met at <HI>Saybrook,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apr. 4 1716</NOTE> and called the Students before them, and enquired into the Occasion of their Uneasiness and Disorder. They principally insisted upon the insuffici∣ency of their Instruction; and sundry of them who lived in or near Hartford and Weathersfield, said that it was a Hardship for them to be obliged to reside at Saybrook, when they could as well or better be instruc∣ted nearer home. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is said, that several of these Things were suggested to them by others, with a Design to help forward a Removal of the College.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Trustees entered into a long Debate upon all the Circumstances of the Collegiate School, and it seems did not entirely agree in their Sentiments, and secret Views and Motives of Action; but at length they condescended to give a Sort of Toleration, that those Students who were uneasy, might go to other Places for Instruction, till the next Commencement.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010262_0020_0F7E251E086137C8"/>Whereupon the greater Part of the Students went to <HI>Weathersfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1716</NOTE> and were under the Instruction of Mr. <HI>Elisha Williams;</HI> some went to other Places, and some remained at <HI>Saybrook;</HI> but the Small-Pox coming there, a little after, most of them removed to <HI>East-Guilford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> and continued there till the Commencement, under the Tuition of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Russel.</HI></P>
<P>The Collegiate School being in this broken and tot∣tering State, the People in several Parts of the Coun∣try begun to Subscribe large Sums for Building the College, to induce the Trustees to set it where it would best accommodate them. About £. 700 Sterling <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">I suppose the Whole of that Sum was not actually paid.</NOTE> was subscribed for <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and tis said that about £. 500 Sterling was subscribed for <HI>Saybrook;</HI> and a considerable Sum for <HI>Hartford</HI> or <HI>Weathersfield.</HI></P>
<P>The Trustees met at the Commencement at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> September 12, 1716, and entered upon the Conside∣ration of the State and Place of the Collegiate School, but not being perfectly agreed they adjourned to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> to meet on the 17th Day of October follow∣ing; where were present,

<P>At this Meeting the Trustees received 250 Pounds Sterling, which was granted to them by the General Assembly some Years before (from the Sale of the <HI>equivalent</HI> Lands;) and having now in their Treasury about 125 Pounds Sterling, Part of which might probably be the Effect of the Contribution in 1703, and Part of it saved by not having a Resident Rec∣tor; and being also encouraged by the large Sub∣scriptions before-mentioned; they voted to build a large and convenient College and Rector's House at <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and appointed a Committee to carry on the Work. The College accordingly was raised on the 8th Day of <HI>October</HI> following.</P>
<P>They also Voted, that the Rev.

<P>The foregoing Acts past at the last Meeting were all read and confirmed, and subscribed to by all the Members present; except Mr. <HI>Stephen Buckingham.</HI> And again on the 11th of September following.</P>
<P>These Proceedings were strongly opposed by many Gentlemen in the Northern and Eastern Parts of the Government, and the Colony in general were much engaged on one Side or the other; insomuch that the Affair was several Times moved in the General As∣sembly, for their Interposition; which occasioned some warm Debates, but no Vote was past.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these Difficulties, the Trustees stea∣dily pursued their own Determinations of settling the College at <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and accordingly held the first Commencement here on September 11, 1717. To
<PB N="20" REF="010262_0023_0F7E251FD21155F0"/>
which four Senior Sophisters came from Saybrook, and received the Degree of Batchelor of Arts, and several others commenced Masters. Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> mo∣derated, and gave Degrees, as Rector <HI>pro Tempore.</HI> The last Year 13 Scholars had resided at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> 14 at <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> and 4 at <HI>Saybrook.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> were very desirous to stop the Proceedings of the Trustees in <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and therefore in <HI>October</HI> following, they entered a Kind of Remonstrance to the General As∣sembly, then sitting at <HI>New-Haven:</HI> wherein they repre∣sented, that the Votes of the Trustees for fixing the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> past October 17th, 1716, and April 5th, 1717, were not legal Votes; for that the Major Part of the Trustees were not in them. That there were Nine Trustees at least, subsisting in Octo∣ber 1716, and but Four of them in the Vote, viz. Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Daven∣port.</HI> That Mr. <HI>Ruggles</HI> was chosen before he was forty Years of Age, and therefore that Choice was null. And that Mr. <HI>James Noyes's</HI> Consent to that Act, at such a Distance and so long after, could be no Confirmation of it. And that in the Act of April 1717, there were but Five Trustees out of Ten.</P>
<P>To which the Trustees, being then convened, re∣plied, That in October 1716, there were but Nine Trustees, Mr. <HI>Pierpont</HI> being dead, and none then chosen in his Room; and Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> of <HI>Windsor</HI> had been Bed-rid many Years, and had resigned the Ministry; and therefore could not be look'd upon as a Trustee. That if it should be granted that Mr. <HI>Ruggles</HI> could not act as a Trustee, at the Time when he was first nominated, yet he was forty Years old before the passing of that Vote; and the Trustees by permitting him, in pursuance to a former Nomina∣tion,
<PB N="21" REF="010262_0024_0F7E25209C399218"/>
to sit and act with them, thereby <HI>associated</HI> him, according to the Charter. That inasmuch as the Trus∣tees were not limited in their Way and Manner of acting or voting, Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> tho' absent from the Meeting, might give his Consent to an Act by sub∣scribing it at home, within two or three Months after, as well as if he had been present. And so there was a Majority of Six out of Nine. And in April 1717, after Mr. <HI>Stephen Buckingham</HI> was chosen, there was a Majority of Six out of Ten. But if Mr. <HI>Ruggles</HI> should not be reckoned at either of the Meet∣ing, nor Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> nor any other Trustee when absent, then there will be a Majority of those who were present, which makes a legal Act.</P>
<P>Whereupon the upper House were of Opinion, <Q>that the Objections against the Vote of the Trustees were insufficient.</Q> And after a long Debate in the lower House, they did not see Cause to Vote any Thing upon it.</P>
<P>The Trustees being then convened at <HI>New-Haven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 30</NOTE> and being inclined to cut of all Occasion of Objec∣tion for the future, past a Vote, wherein they declared and associated Mr. <HI>Ruggles</HI> a Trustee.

<P><PB N="22" REF="010262_0025_0F7E2521727CCE00"/>The Reason assigned by the Trustees in their Votes (and other Papers) for settling the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> were these; the Difficulty of keeping it at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> which arose partly from the Uneasiness of the Scholars, partly from the continual Endeavours of some to carry it to <HI>Hartford,</HI> which they supposed to be at too great a Distance from the Sea, and would no ways accommodate the Western Colonies. That they look'd upon <HI>New-Haven</HI> to be in itself the most convenient Place, on the Account of the commodi∣ousness of its Situation, the agreableness of the Air and Soil, and the Cheapness of Commodities; and that very large Donations had been made towards the Building an House there, without which they had not sufficient to defray the Charge.</P>
<P>The Major Part of the General Assembly, being desirous to strengthen the Hands of the Trustees in the present Difficulties, past the following Vote, in the same Session, viz. <Q>That under the present Circumstances of the Affairs of the Collegiate School, the Rev. Trustees be advised to proceed in that Affair; and to finish the House they have built in <HI>New-Haven,</HI> for the Entertainment of the Scholars belonging to the Collegiate School.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding these Votes of the Trustees and the General Assembly, some Gentlemen still pursued their Design of carrying the College to <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> and therefore encouraged the Scholars there, which were about 14 in Number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1718</NOTE> to continue there: and in May following they again moved the Affair to the General Assembly at <HI>Hartford.</HI> The lower House voted, <Q>to desire the Trustees, to Consent that the Commencements should be held alternately at <HI>Wea∣thersfield</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> till the Place of the School be fully determined.</Q> The Upper House were of
<PB N="23" REF="010262_0026_0F7E252212CB1C88"/>
Opinion that the Place of the <Q>School was fully determined already, by the indisputable Votes of the Trustees, and the subsequent Advice of the Assem∣bly thereupon;</Q> and therefore did not concur.</P>
<P>Presently after this, the Collegiate School at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> received sundry very large and generous Dona∣tions; (which were very acceptable at this difficult Time.) The greatest of which was from the Hon∣orable ELIHU YALE, of <HI>London,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of the East-India Company. He was Heir to a Manor in <HI>Wales,</HI> of the Value of 500 Pounds Sterling per Annum, besides the vast Treasures he got by his per∣sonal Industry while he was in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> The paternal Estate (as it was said) being entailed to the Male Heir of the Family, and he, having no Son, but three Daughters, sent to his first Cousin and next Male Heir Mr. <HI>John Yale</HI> of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> with whom he had been formerly acquainted in <HI>England,</HI> to send him one of his Sons, to inherit the paternal Estate. Accord∣ingly in the Year 1712, he sent his Son Mr. <HI>David Yale,</HI> to London, who upon his Return was graduated at this College 1724.</P>
<P>These Things brought Governor YALE into Cor∣respondence with the Honorable Governor <HI>Saltonstall</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pierpont</HI> of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> which was the Occasion of his generous Donations. In the Year 1714 he sent 40 Volumes of Books in Mr. <HI>Dummer's</HI> Collection. Last Year he sent above 300 Volumes, both which Parcels I suppose to be worth 100 Pounds Sterling. This Summer he sent Goods to the Value of 200 Pounds Sterling at prime Cost, besides the King's Picture and Arms; with some Intimations that he would yet add; and accordingly three Years after, he sent to the Value of 100 Pounds more; both which
<PB N="24" REF="010262_0027_0F7E252333F66DE0"/>
Parcels were sold here for an Equivalent to 400 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> at this Time also sent 76 Volumes of Books, whereof 20 were Folios, in Value about 30 Pounds Sterling. The Honorable <HI>Gurdon Saltonstall,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Jahaleel Brenton,</HI> of Newport, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> gave, each of them, 50 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Upon the Receipt of these and other large Donati∣ons, the Circumstances of the Collegiate School were very much altered for the better, and the Trustees were now well enabled to finish the large and com∣modious College House, which they had before erected; it was raised on the 8th Day of October 1717, and within a Year after was so far finished, as to be fit for the commodious Reception of the Students. It was 170 Feet long, 22 Feet wide, and 3 Story high; made a handsome Appearance, and contained near 50 Studies in convenient Chambers, besides the Hall, Library and Kitchin, and Cost about 1000 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>On September 12, 1718, there was a splendid Com∣mencement held at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> where were present, besides the Trustees, the Honorable GURDON SAL∣TONSTALL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of the Colony of <HI>Connec∣ticut,</HI> the Honorable <HI>William Taylor,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> as repre∣senting <HI>Governor Yale,</HI> the Honorable <HI>Nathan Gold,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Deputy Governor, sundry of the worshipful As∣sistants, the Judges of the Circuit, a great Number of Rev. Ministers, and a great Concourse of Spectators.</P>
<P>The Trustees, in Commemoration of <HI>Governor Yale</HI>'s great Generosity, called the Collegiate School, after his Name, YALE-COLLEGE; and entred a Memorial thereof upon Record, which is as follows.</P>

<P>THE Trustees of the <HI>Collegiate School,</HI> constituted in the splendid Town of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> being enabled by the most Generous Donation of the Honorable <HI>ELIHU YALE,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to finish the College House, already begun and erected, gratefully considering the Honour due to such and so great a Benefactor and Patron, and being desi∣rous, in the best Manner, to perpetuate to all Ages the Memory of so great a Benefit, conferred chiefly on this Colony: <HI>WE</HI> the Trustees, having the Honour of being intrusted with an Affair of so great Importance to the common Good of the People, especially of this Province, do with one Consent agree, determine and ordain, that our College House shall be called by the Name of it's Munificent Patron, and shall be named <HI>YALE-COLLEGE:</HI> That this Province may keep and preserve a lasting Monument of such a Generous Gentleman, who, by so great a Benevolence and Generosity, has provided for their greatest Good, and the peculiar Advantage of the Inhabitants, both in the pre∣sent and future Ages.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>On the Commencement Day Morning, this Monu∣ment both of Generosity and Gratitude was with solemn Pomp read off in the College Hall, both in Latin and English; then the Procession moved to the Meeting-House, to attend the Publick Exercises of the Day: Wherein, besides the Oration made by one of the Bachelors, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Davenport,</HI> one of the Trustees, at the Desire of the Body, made a florid Oration, wherein he largely insisted upon and highly extolled the Generosity of <HI>Governor Yale.</HI> Eight Can∣didates received the Honour of a Degree of Bachelor of Arts; and several more were created Masters. And the Honorable Governor <HI>Saltonstall</HI> was pleased to Grace and Crown the whole Solemnity, with an ele∣gant Latin Oration; wherein he congratulated the pre∣sent
<PB N="27" REF="010262_0030_0F7E486464E9D440"/>
happy State of the College, in being sixed at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and enrich'd with so many noble Bene∣factions; and particularly celebrated the great Gene∣rosity of <HI>Governor Yale,</HI> with much Respect and Honour.</P>
<P>After this the Trustees sent a very Complaisant Let∣ter of Thanks to Governor <HI>Yale;</HI> and gave him a particular Account of all the Transactions at the Com∣mencement. They also sent a Letter of Thanks to their great Friend and Patron <HI>Jeremiah Dummer,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for his late Donation of Books; and another to the Honorable General <HI>Nicholson</HI> for his Donation of Books in Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Collection; and for a late Donation, the Number or Value of which I can't find.</P>
<P>On the same Day upon which the Commencement was carried on at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> something like a Com∣mencement was carried on at <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> before a large Number of Spectators; five Scholars, who were originally of the Class, which now took their Degrees at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> performed publick Exercises; the Rev. Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> acted as Moderator; and he and Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> and other Ministers present signed Certifi∣cates, that they judged them to be worthy of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts; these Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> delivered to them in a formal Manner in the Meet∣ing-House; which was commonly taken and repre∣sented as giving them their Degrees.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Irregularity, which wise and good Men fell into in a Time of Strife and Tempta∣tion; yet the Trustees were disposed to condescend, as far as possible, to gain and reconcile those who had withdrawn from them; and therefore ordered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> <Q>that if any of those Five Scholars should produce to the Rector, a Testimony under the Hands of any two
<PB N="28" REF="010262_0031_0F7E4865922E7EC8"/>
Trustees, of their having been approved by them, as qualified for a Degree, the Rector upon easy and reasonable Terms, should give them a Diploma in the usual Form, and that their Names should be inserted in the Class, as they were at first placed;</Q>
which was done accordingly. They also directed the rest of the Scholars remaining at <HI>Weathersfield</HI> to come to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and paid for their Tuition while they were there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 9.</NOTE>The General Assembly in October following, <Q>in Order to quiet the Minds of People, and introduce a general Harmony in the Publick Affairs, ordered that a <HI>State House</HI> should be built at <HI>Hartford,</HI> to compensate for the College at <HI>New-Haven;</HI> that 25 Pounds Sterling should be given to <HI>Saybrook</HI> for the Use of the School, to compensate for the Removal of the College: That the Governor and Council should, at the Desire of the Trustees, give such Orders as they should think proper for the Remo∣val of the Library from <HI>Saybrook</HI> to <HI>New-Haven:</HI> That the Scholars at <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> should go to <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and the College should be carried on, promoted and encouraged at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and all due Care taken for its flourishing.</Q></P>
<P>In December following the Governor and Council, at the Desire of the Trustees, met at <HI>Saybrook;</HI> and gave a Warrant to the Sheriff, to deliver the Books to the Trustees. The House where the Books were, was filled and surrounded with a great Number of Men, who were determined to prevent the Removal of the Books; and therefore resisted the Officer: But he, with his Attendants, broke open the Door, and delivered the Books to the Trustees, or their
<PB N="29" REF="010262_0032_0F7E4865A9988770"/>
Order; and so they were conveyed to <HI>New-Haven.</HI> But in this Tumult and Confusion, about 250 of the most valuable Books, and sundry Papers of Impor∣tance were conveyed away by unknown Hands, and never could be found again.</P>
<P>After this unhappy Struggle, the Spirits of Men began, by Degrees to subside; and a general Har∣mony was gradually introduced among the Trustees, and the Colony in general. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Wood∣bridge</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> became very friendly to the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and forward to promote all its Interests. The Trustees, in Testimony of their Friendship and Regard to Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> chose him <HI>Rector pro Tempore;</HI> and he accordingly moderated and gave Degrees at the Commencement Anno 1723. Yet in this Time of Anarchy and Confusion, while all College Order and Authority was in a Manner dissolved, the Scholars contracted such licentious and vicious Habits, as were not wholly suppressed and extirpated out of the College in several Years.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Yale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1721</NOTE> the great Benefactor to this Col∣lege died July 8th, 1721. He descended from an ancient and wealthy Family in <HI>Wales;</HI> who for many Generations possest the Manor of <HI>Plas Grannow,</HI> and several other Messuages, near the City of <HI>Wrexham,</HI> of the yearly Value of 500 Pounds. <HI>Thomas Yale,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Governor's Father, for the Sake of Religion, came over to <HI>America</HI> with the first Settlers of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> in the Year 1638. Here the Governor was born, April 5, 1648. He went to <HI>England</HI> at the Age of about 10 Years; to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> at about 30, where he lived near 20 Years; acquired a very great Estate, was made Governor of Fort <HI>St. George;</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="010262_0033_0F7E48666EFB2538"/>
married an Indian-Lady of Fortune, the Relict of Governor <HI>Hinmers,</HI> his Predecessor; by whom he had three Daughters; viz. <HI>Katharine,</HI> who was afterwards married to <HI>Dudley North,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> commonly called <HI>Lord North. Ann,</HI> who was married to the Lord <HI>James Cavendish,</HI> Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Devonshire.</HI> And <HI>Ursula,</HI> who died unmarried. After his Return to <HI>London,</HI> he was chosen Governor of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; and made the Donations beforementioned. And it is said, that a little before his Death, he wrote his Will, wherein he gave 500 Pounds more: But afterwards, thinking it was best to execute that Part of his Will in his Life-time, he packed up Goods to that Value, ready to be sent; but before they were shipped, he took a Journey into <HI>Wales,</HI> and died at <HI>Wrexham,</HI> in or near the Seat of his Ancestors. So that the Goods were not sent; neither could the Will obtain a <HI>Probate;</HI> altho' Governor <HI>Saltonstall</HI> took much Pains to effect it.</P>
<P>He was a Gentleman, who greatly abounded in good Humour and Generosity, as well as in Wealth: And his Name and Memory will be gratefully per∣petuated in YALE-COLLEGE.</P>
<P>After the College was fixed at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> was enriched with sundry noble Benefactions, and had a handsome and commodious House built for the Re∣ception of the Students, it began to flourish; and was much more taken Notice of in the World, than it was in its more obscure State at <HI>Saybrook.</HI> The Number of the Students was now about 40, who were under two Tutors, and sometimes visited by Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> Rector pro Tempore. But yet the Col∣lege was under great Inconveniencies both with Re∣spect to Government and Instruction, for want of a Resident Rector.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="010262_0034_0F7E486725D9AE98"/>The Trustees therefore met at New-Haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1719</NOTE> in March 1719, and chose the Rev. Mr. <HI>Timothy Cutler,</HI> Minister of <HI>Stratford,</HI> to be Resident Rector, till the next Meeting of the Trustees. He presently came to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and entred upon the Business. At the next Commencement the Trustees voted, <Q>that Mr. Cutler's Service hitherto in the Place of a Rector was to their good Satisfaction, and therefore they desired him to continue in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1720</NOTE></Q> And after several Conferences with, and Proposals to the People at <HI>Stratford,</HI> it was finally agreed, that the People at <HI>Stratford</HI> should have Mr. <HI>Cutler</HI>'s House and Home-lot there, in Consideration of his Removal; and that the Trustees should give him 84 Pounds Sterling for it: Which was paid out of the 120 Pounds lately given by the General Assembly, by the Sale of Lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1721</NOTE></P>
<P>To accommodate the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cutler</HI> and his Family, the Trustees built the Rector's House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1722</NOTE> in the Year 1722, which with the Land and Appurtenances Cost 260 Pounds Sterling, of which 35 Pounds was raised by Subscription, 55 Pounds by a general Con∣tribution, 115 Pounds by Impost on Rum, and 55 Pounds out of Governor Yale's last Donation.</P>
<P>The College seemed now to be in a settled and flourishing State, but there was a sudden and unex∣pected Change; for at the next Commencement, it was discovered, that the Rector, one of the Tutors, and two of the neighbouring Ministers had agreed to leave the Communion of the Churches in the Co∣lony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and to go to <HI>England</HI> for epis∣copal Ordination. This Event was somewhat sur∣prising to the Trustees and to the Body of the Peo∣ple; for at that Time there was not one episcopal Minister in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and but very

few of the Laity, who were episcopally inclined. Whereupon the Trustees met, and passed the follow∣ing Votes.</P>

Act of the General Assembly; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">This is agreable to the Constitution of all the Universities in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which all the Officers are admitted and continued, upon Condition that they explicitly give their Consent to the <HI>Westminster</HI> Confession of Faith, received in the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI> as the Confession of <HI>their</HI> Faith, agreable to the Word of God, and containing the Sum and Substance of the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches. This is confirmed by sundry Acts of Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly that of William and Mary, Parl. I. Sess. II. Act V. The King and Queens Majesties and the three Estates of Parliament conceiving it to be their bounden Duty, after the great Deliverance which God had wrought for this Church and Kingdom, in the first Place, to settle and secure therein the Protestant Religion according to the Truth of Gods Word, do by these Presents ratify and esta∣blish the <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> now read in their Presence, and voted and approved of, as the publick Confession of Faith in this Church; containing the Sum and Substance of the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1723</NOTE>Mr. <HI>Daniel Turner</HI> of <HI>London</HI> sent to the Library sundry Volumes of his own Works, on Physick and Chirurgery; and a Collection of other valuable Books, principally on the same Subject; and particularly the large Volume of <HI>Cowper's Anatomy.</HI> Whereupon the Trustees sent him a <HI>Diploma,</HI> creating him <HI>Doctor of Physick.</HI></P>
<P>The Controversy about moving the College had occasioned several Questions upon the College Char∣ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 10 1723</NOTE> whereupon the General Assembly made an Ex∣planatory and additional Act; in which it was de∣clared, <Q>that any Trustee might resign his Office when he should see cause. That seven Trustees conven'd at any Meeting, properly warned, should be a Quorum; and have Power to act by a Ma∣jority then present: And to appoint a Clerk to Re∣gister their Acts. That a Minister of Thirty Years of Age, might be chosen a Trustee: And that the Rector should be a Trustee <HI>ex Officio.</HI></Q> There was, for a Time, some Hesitation about the Reception of this Act.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="010262_0038_0F7E486D94FA7FA8"/>After Mr. <HI>Cutler</HI>'s Removal there was no settled resident Rector for near 4 Years. In this Interval the Trustees agreed, that each of them, by turns, should reside at College, about a Month at a Time, with the Authority of a Rector. But this Form of Government did not very well answer the End; for tho' there were several Instances of strict Discipline and Punishment of Offences; yet the ill Habits for∣merly contracted by the Students were not easily and suddenly eradicated, and before the Vice-Rector could have Time to learn sufficient Experience how to exe∣cute his Office to Advantage, he resigned his Post. But at the Commencements, Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> moderated, and gave Degrees, in the Years 1724, 1725 and 1726.</P>
<P>In September 29, 1725,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1725</NOTE> the Trustees chose the Rev. Mr. <HI>Elisha Williams,</HI> Minister of <HI>Newington,</HI> in <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> to be <HI>Rector</HI> of the College; and ap∣pointed Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitman,</HI> to obtain his acceptance of the Office. In May following they put in a Memorial to the Gene∣ral Assembly, desiring them to make Satisfaction to the Parish of <HI>Newington,</HI> on the Account of their Mi∣nister's Removal; and they accordingly released the Parish from their County Tax for Three Years.</P>
<P>The Circumstances of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Removal were<NOTE PLACE="marg">1726</NOTE> not settled before the next Commencement. And therefore, Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> still presided. And on the next Day after, Mr. <HI>Rector Williams</HI> was installed, in the following Manner, viz. In the Library, before the Trustees, he gave his Consent to the <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> and Rules of Church-Discipline, agreed upon by the Churches of this Colony, in 1708. After Dinner he made a publick Oration in the Hall; and the Trus∣tees successively came and saluted him as RECTOR.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="010262_0039_0F7E4870568E5E48"/>After Mr. Rector <HI>Williams</HI> was settled in his Post, he began, by Degrees, more effectually to suppress Vice and Disorder among the Students; and to in∣troduce and settle a Number of good Customs: A Taste for many Parts of useful and polite Literature increased; and the State of the College has been gra∣dually growing better ever since.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1730</NOTE>In the Year 1702, Major <HI>James Fitch</HI> gave a Deed, in Confirmation of the Donation of Land, he had made some Time before. Afterwards there was a Contro∣versy and Law Suit with Mr. <HI>John Fisk,</HI> and <HI>James Leavins,</HI> about the Bounds of it, (they having a Sur∣vey which interfered with it.) A Clause in the Deed to the College was construed to Limit the Grant to <HI>Saybrook.</HI> Upon an Agreement with Major <HI>Fitch,</HI> in the Year 1719, he gave the Trustees a new Deed of it; and they paid him 15 Pounds Sterling in Money, and expended 15 Pounds more for pious Uses, ac∣cording to Major <HI>Fitch</HI>'s Direction. And finally, in the Year 1730, to put an End to all Controversies with Mr. <HI>Fisk</HI> and <HI>Leavins,</HI> the Trustees, by Way of Exchange, gave them a Deed of the Land given by Major <HI>Fitch,</HI> and they gave the Trustees a Deed of 628 Acres of Land in SALISBURY. I judge that the Trustees gave and expended, in various Ways on Account of the said Land, near half the Value of it, at that Time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1732</NOTE>In October 1732, the General Assembly were pleased generously to Grant 1500 Acres of Land to the Col∣lege, viz. 300 in each of the new Towns of <HI>Norfolk, Canaan, Goshen, Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Kent.</HI> In Confirmation of which a Patent was given May 16, 1741.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="010262_0040_0F7E487126656050"/>The Rev. Dr. GEORGE BERKELEY, then Dean of <HI>Derry,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> afterwards Bishop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> came into <HI>North-America,</HI> in Order to found an Episcopal College. He resided a Year or two at <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where he purchased a Country Seat, with about 96 Acres of Land; and became acquainted with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Jared Eliot</HI> of <HI>Killingworth,</HI> one of the Trustees, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Johnson,</HI> Episcopal Minister at <HI>Stratford,</HI> and some other Gentlemen, who informed him of the State and Genius of this Col∣lege; he had also a Correspondence with Mr. Rector <HI>Williams;</HI> all which were the Occasions of his gene∣rous Donations. While he resided at <HI>Newport,</HI> he sent all his own Works, a Present to the College. It so happened, that he did not pursue his Design of founding a College in <HI>North-America;</HI> but returned back to <HI>London.</HI> And being a Gentleman who was furnished with a great Treasure of ingenious and po∣lite Learning, and endowed with a generous Disposi∣tion to promote and propagate the same among Man∣kind; he sent a Deed of his Farm at <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> to this College, in the Year 1732. The Descriptions and Conditions in the Deed not being perfectly adap∣ted to the State of the College, at the Desire of the Trustees he, next Year, sent another Deed, in which it was ordered, that the Rents of the Farm, (after necessary Charges are deducted,) should be appropri∣ated to the Maintenance of the Three best Scholars in Greek and Latin, who should reside at College, at least nine Months in a Year, in each of the Three Years between their first and second Degrees: That on the 6th Day of May annually, or in Case that should be Sunday, on the Seventh, the Candidates should be publickly examined by the President or Rector, and the Senior Episcopal Missionary within

this Colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1733</NOTE> who should be then present; and in Case none be present, then by the President only. And in Case the President and Senior Missionary should not agree in their Sentiments, who are the best Scho∣lars, the Case shall be determined by Lot. And that all Surplusages of Money which should happen by any Vacancies, shall be distributed in Greek and Latin Books to such under-graduate Students as should make the best Composition or Declamation in the Latin Tongue, upon such a moral Theme as shall be given them.</P>
<P>This Premium has been a great Incitement to a laudable Ambition to excell in the Knowledge of the Classics.</P>
<P>At the same Time the Rev. Dr. <HI>Berkeley</HI> pursuing his generous Intentions, sent to this College the finest Collection of Books that ever came together at one Time into <HI>America.</HI> The Number was near 1000 Volumes, (including those which he had sent before) whereof 260 were Folios, and generally very large. I judge that this Collection cost, at least 400 Pounds Sterling. This Donation of Books was made, partly out of the Doctor's own Estate, but principally out of Monies which he procured from some generous Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI> Upon the Receipt of them, the Trustees sent the Doctor a Letter of Thanks, and have since given him repeated Expressions of the grateful Sense which they retain of his Generosity towards this College.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1739</NOTE>The College flourished many Years under Mr. Rector <HI>Williams</HI>'s Administration; but the Sea Air and southerly Winds at <HI>New-Haven</HI> did not agree with his Constitution, and sometimes incapacitated him for Business, so that he found himself by Degrees
<PB N="39" REF="010262_0042_0F7E487263A48EB8"/>
necessitated to resign his Office; which he accordingly did, at a Meeting of the Trustees October the 31st, 1739. <Q>The Trustees returned him <HI>their hearty Thanks for his good Service to the College.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After this he retired, and lived on his own Estate at <HI>Weathersfield;</HI> was soon made Speaker of the Hon∣orable House of Representatives, a Judge of the Su∣perior Court, and Colonel of a Regiment, in an in∣tended Expedition against <HI>Canada.</HI> Afterwards he went to <HI>England,</HI> to receive the Wages due to him∣self and his Regiment; and there cultivated a perso∣nal Acquaintance, with several Gentlemen of Distinc∣tion; and married a Gentlewoman of superior Ac∣complishments. He then returned to his Seat at <HI>Weathersfield;</HI> and died there, July 24th, 1755.</P>
<P>He was educated at <HI>Harvard-College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and graduated there, Anno. 1711: Was furnished with most Parts and Kinds of aca∣demical Literature: And left the College in a much better State than he found it. His just Character is given at large in a funeral Sermon preached by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Lockwood;</HI> and in the Appendix. The Rev. Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> who had an intimate Acquaintance with him in <HI>England,</HI> gives this Short, but compre∣hensive Character of him, in a Letter to a Friend; <Q>I look upon Col. <HI>Williams</HI> to be one of the most valuable Men upon Earth, he has joined to an ardent Sense of Religion, solid Learning, consum∣mate Prudence, great Candour and sweetness of Tem∣per, and a certain nobleness of Soul, capable of contriving and acting the greatest Things, without seeming to be conscious of his having done them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="010262_0043_0F7E4873A447CBC8"/>October 31, 1739, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Clap,</HI> Minister of <HI>Windham,</HI> was chosen Rector of this Col∣lege; and the Rev. Messieurs <HI>Ebenezer Williams,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Woodbridge,</HI> were appointed a Committee to treat with him and his People, in Order to obtain his Acceptance of the Office. The Committee went to <HI>Windham</HI> on the 10th of November; having given previous Notice of their coming and Design. The Generality of the People could not be satisfied that it was their Duty to part with their Minister, on this Occasion; on the other Hand they were not satisfied that they should be in the Way of their Duty to oppose his going; so that after a considera∣ble Debate, they did little or nothing, but left the whole Affair to the Conduct of Providence.</P>
<P>The Committee moved for the calling of a Coun∣cil of the Churches in the County, to advise in this important Affair; who after a publick Hearing of the Objections, which some of the People made against his Removal, gave it as their Opinion and Advice, <Q>That it was Mr. <HI>Clap</HI>'s Duty to accept of the Of∣fice of Rector of the College, as being a Call of Providence, to greater and more extensive Useful∣ness.</Q> The Committee of the Trustees considering the great Inconveniencies which the College had for∣merly sustained by the long Intervals in which it was destitute of a resident Rector, urged Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> to be speedy in accepting and undertaking the Busi∣ness: Whereupon he concluded to accept of it, as a Call of Providence; and accordingly in December made a Visit to the College.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1740</NOTE>At a Meeting of the Trustees, on the 2d Day of April following, he was installed, in the follow∣ing Manner, viz. He gave his Consent to <HI>the Con∣fession
<PB N="41" REF="010262_0044_0F7E48741375DF60"/>
of Faith</HI> and Rules of Church Discipline, agreed upon by the Churches in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> assembled by Delegation at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> in the Year 1708: And gave Satisfaction as to the Soundness of his Prin∣ciples, according to the Act of the Trustees, Anno. 1722. Then they went into the Hall; the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitman,</HI> the Moderator began with Prayer; and one of the Students made an Oration proper for the Oc∣casion; then the Moderator made a Speech, in Latin, wherein he committed the Care of instructing and governing the College to the Rector; and <HI>he</HI> con∣cluded the whole with an Oration.</P>
<P>The Trustees met at <HI>Hartford</HI> in May following; and the Committee of the first Society in <HI>Windham,</HI> moved that they might have Recompence for the Removal of their Pastor; they mutually agreed to re∣fer it to three Gentlemen of the General Assembly, to consider what Recompence they ought to have; those Gentlemen were of Opinion, that inasmuch as Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> had been in the Ministry at <HI>Windham</HI> 14 Years, which was about Half the Time Ministers in general continue in their publick Work; the People ought to have Half so much as they gave him for a Settlement, which upon Computation was about 53 Pounds Sterling. Whereupon the Trustees put in a Memorial to the General Assembly, praying them to grant that Sum to the People of <HI>Windham;</HI> which they readily did.</P>
<P>The College was now, in the main, in a good State; yet not so perfect, but that it would admit of sundry Emendations. The Rector therefore endea∣voured by all Ways and Means in his Power, to bring it forward towards a State of Perfection. The
<PB N="42" REF="010262_0045_0F7E4874A1632E20"/>
first Business of special Importance, which he entered upon, was the compiling a Body of Laws. At the first founding of this College, it was ordered, that where no special Provision was made by the Trustees, the Laws of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> should be the Rule. About the Time the College was fixed at <HI>New-Ha∣ven,</HI> a short Body of Laws was drawn up, which was usually transcribed by the Scholars at their Ad∣mission; but these, in Time, were found to be very defective; and several of them became obsolete. In the Year 1735, the Trustees appointed a Committee with the Rector, to draw up a new Body; but he, being in a declining State of Health, did little or nothing upon it. As soon therefore as Rector <HI>Clap</HI> was fixed in his Post, the Trustees desired him to enter upon the Business; accordingly a large Body was drawn up, partly out of the ancient Laws and Statutes of this College, partly from the principal and most important Customs which had obtained, partly from the Laws of <HI>Harvard</HI> College, and partly from the Statutes of the University of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and some few new ones were added. This Body was pe∣rused by a Committee, then by most of their Mem∣bers at their own Homes, and after several Readings at the Trustee's Board, passed their Sanction in 1745. These Laws were afterwards translated into Latin and printed in 1748: And some Additions have been made since, with several new Editions.</P>
<P>About the same Time the Rector collected and wrote down, under proper Heads, all the <HI>Customs</HI> of College, which had from Time to Time obtained and been established by Practice, which made as large a Volume as the Statutes. By all which Means, the Rules by which the Officers and Students of the Col∣lege were to conduct themselves, became better fixed
<PB N="43" REF="010262_0046_0F7E4877BA320A70"/>
and known, and the Government of the College was rendered more steady and uniform, and less arbitrary.</P>
<P>Before this Time there never had been any perfect Catalogue of the Books in the Library;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1742</NOTE> for want of which the Students were deprived of much of the Benefit and Advantage of them. The Rector there∣fore placed all the Books in the Library, in a pro∣per Order (but in Honour to the Rev. Dr. <HI>Berkeley,</HI> for his extraordinary Donation, his Books stood by themselves, at the South End of the Library) and put a <HI>Number</HI> to every Book in it's proper Class and Box; and then took three Catalogues of the Books, one as they stood in their proper Order on the Shelves; and another in an Alphabetical Order; and a Third, wherein the most valuable Books were placed under proper Heads, according to the Sub∣ject Matter of them; together with Figures referring to the Place and Number of each Book. By which Means it might be easily known what Books were in the Library upon any particular Subject, and where they might be found, with the utmost Expedition. This Catalogue was printed, and was a great Incite∣ment to the Diligence and Industry of the Scholars in reading of them. About the same Time the Ge∣neral Assembly augmented their annual Grant to the College, whereby they were enabled to support three Tutors, one to each Class, including the Rector. This removed a great Inconveniency which the College had before been under by one Tutor's hearing two Clas∣ses, and sometimes more. And thereupon the Scho∣lars studied and recited much more than they had done in Years past.</P>

<P N="11">XI. And for the special Encouragement and Sup∣port of said College, this Assembly do hereby Grant unto the said President and Fellows, and their Suc∣cessors, for the Use of the said College, in Lieu of all former Grants, One Hundred Pounds Silver Mo∣ney, at the Rate of Six Shillings and Eight Pence per Ounce, to be paid in Bills of publick Credit, or other Currency equivalent to the said Hundred Pounds (the Rate, or Value thereof to be stated from Time to Time by this Assembly) in two equal Payments, in October and May annually.

<PB N="52" REF="010262_0055_0F7E48808A238138"/>
exercise all the Powers and Privileges therein menti∣oned and contained.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This Charter set the College in a much more perfect and agreable State, than it was before, and the annual Grant of £. <HI>100,</HI> or a supposed equivalent in Bills, as stated by the General Assembly, as often as the depreciated State of the Bills seemed to require, was paid by the Trea∣surer, till the Year <HI>1755.</HI> When a French War and heavy Taxes came on, and the Bills were ordered to be called in; so that the Gene∣ral Assembly did not State an Equivalent, and nothing was paid by the Treasurer to the College, for several Years. And by Reason of the great Number of Students, about that Time, the College, with great Frugality was able to subsist. After the Charges of the War were in some Measure abated, (tho' the Colony was still under pressing Difficul∣ties) the Assembly took the State and Exigencies of the College, into Con∣sideration: And thereupon a Question arose, in the Honorable House of Representatives, <Q>Whether any legal Claim or Demand could be made upon the said <HI>annual Grant,</HI> or the <HI>Arrearages</HI> of it.</Q> This Ques∣tion was debated at several Sessions, and the House were so near equally divided in their Sentiments upon it, as that a Major Vote could not be obtained for the Payment or Grant of any Money, upon a Sup∣position of the Truth of either Side of the Question. Upon a Proposal made in the House, <Q>That the President and Fellows should do some∣thing to remove that Difficulty,</Q> and a Committee of the House being thereupon appointed; the President and Fellows, upon the Advice of the said Committee, declared in Writing to the House in October <HI>1765,</HI> <Q>That they would not make any <HI>legal Claim</HI> or <HI>Demand</HI> upon the said <HI>annual Grant,</HI> or the <HI>Arrearages</HI> of it; and would depend upon the Wisdom and Goodness of the Honorable Assembly, to grant such Supplies, as the Circumstances of the Colony, and the Exigencies of the College, should from Time to Time require.</Q> The Assembly, at that Time, gave £. <HI>327-28 S.</HI> Lawful Money, towards building a Chapel.</NOTE></P>

The Executors paid the Ten Pounds to the Trustees, but being informed that there was a large Debt due from the Estate, in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> paid nothing to the graduated Ministers; and they living at a great Distance, and some Difficulties intervening, did nothing further in many Years. In the mean Time many of the young Ministers grew uneasy, and ventured to sell some of the Lands, tho' none of them had any Authority to sell; and the greater Part had no Right to the Money, because, as the Lands were appraised in the Inventory, the Money would all be run out, before it came to them. And other Persons, who had no Pretence of Right, got into Possession of some of the Lands, and kept them so long as to claim them by Possession. And it appeared that Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> was cheated in some Parcels, because the Persons who sold them to him, had no Right. The President being unwilling that the Estate should be lost, as to the End for which it was given, set up a Notification in the Hall at the Commencement 1744, desiring those Ministers who had any Interest, to meet and consult upon it. They met and chose a Committee to Manage the Affair; but they found it attended with so many Difficulties that they could not do it, to any Advantage; and therefore agreed to resign it up to the President and Fellows; who would be under a better Capacity to
<PB N="54" REF="010262_0057_0F7E488168F6ADD8"/>
manage it. Accordingly most of those who were supposed to have any Interest, freely resigned it up to the President and Fellows, to be improved for the Benefit of the College, in such a Manner as they should think best; and the rest of the Rights were purchased. And the Executors gave to the President and Fellows a Deed of all the Lands of which Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> died seized; whereupon with considerable Pains and Expence, they became possessed of about an Hundred Acres of Land in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and Sixty Two Acres, lying in five Parcels, in <HI>New-Haven;</HI> exclusive of those sold by the young Ministers.</P>
<P>The Honorable <HI>Phillip Livingston,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of his Majesty's Council for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> hav∣ing had four Sons educated at this College, was pleased generously to bestow Twenty Eight Pounds and Ten Shillings Sterling, to be put out to Interest, and the Interest to be appropriated for the Support of a <HI>Professor of Divinity,</HI> or to any other Use the President and Fellows should think to be most for the Advantage of the College. And they being of Opi∣nion that a Professor of Divinity would be most Ad∣vantageous, appropriated the Donation to that Use.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1748</NOTE>The Number of Students being about One Hun∣dred and Twenty, more than half of them were oblig∣ed, for want of Room, to live out of the College; which was upon many Accounts inconvenient. The President therefore projected a Scheme for building a new College House. And accordingly, upon Con∣sultation with some of the Fellows, obtained of the General Assembly in May 1747, the Liberty of a
<PB N="55" REF="010262_0058_0F7E488221938CF0"/>
Lottery for that Purpose; by which Five Hundred Pounds Sterling was raised, clear of all Charge and Deductions.</P>
<P>The Foundation of the House was laid April the 17th, 1750. And the Outside was finished in Sep∣tember 1752.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It took about <HI>230,000</HI> Bricks, and the Cost of the Outside was about £. <HI>1180</HI> Sterling.</NOTE> It is 100 Feet long, 40 Feet wide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1750</NOTE> and three Story high, besides the Garrets; and a Cellar under the whole, containing 32 Chambers, and 64 Studies. It makes a good Appearance, and was set back in the Yard that there might be a large and handsome Area before it, and toward the North Side of the Yard, with a View that when the old College should come down, another College or Chapel or both should be set on the South of the present House; and additional Lands were purchased on the North and on the West for better Accom∣modation.</P>
<P>The General Assembly in October 1749, ordered, that 363 Pounds in the Hands of <HI>Gurdon Saltonstall,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which came by a French Prize, taken by the Frigate belonging to the Government; and in Octo∣ber 1751, ordered that the Remainder of the Prize aforesaid, and the Effects of the said Frigate (which, after the War, was sold) amounting to 500 Pounds more, and in October 1754, £. 280 in the Hands of <HI>Gurdon Saltonstall,</HI> and <HI>Jabez Hamlin,</HI> Esqrs, on some old Accounts, should be paid to the President, to∣wards building the new College.</P>

and the College built in a very elegant and hand∣some Manner; by Means of his extraordinary Care, Diligence and Labour, through a Course of several Years: All which the said President has generously given for the Service of said College. And the said President having also, of his own proper Estate purchas∣ed a Lot for the Professor of Divinity, which has cost 52 Pounds Lawful Money, and given it to the College for the said Use for ever.

<P>The Building of this new House was very neces∣sary; for, after it was finished, both Houses would not contain all the Students, which were then in Num∣ber more than 170; so that more than 50 were obliged to live out of College.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Berkeley</HI> received Information from Time to Time, by Letters, and from Gentlemen who were oc∣casionally here, concerning the Management and Ef∣fects of his generous Donations; particularly from an Irish Gentleman, who was present at one of his Examinations, and carried to him two Calculations, made by his Scholars, viz. one of the Place of the Comet, at the Time of the Flood; which appeared Anno 1680, having a periodical Revolution of 575½ Years; which Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> supposes to have been the Cause of the Deluge. And another of the remarka∣ble Eclipse of the Sun in the 10th Year of <HI>Jehoia∣kim;</HI> mentioned by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> Lib. I. Cap. LXXIV. And in <HI>Ushers</HI> Annals.

And the Corporation being desi∣rous to put the Lands under some profitable Im∣provement, more especially for maintaining a Profes∣sor of Divinity; the President projected the follow∣ing Scheme, viz. that the Lands should be leased for the Term of 999 Years; the Rent to be the In∣terest of the present Value of the Lands, at 5 per <HI>Centum;</HI> to be forfeited in Case of non Payment of the Rent, at the annual Times appointed, but re∣deemable within Six Months after, upon Payment of the Rent, with lawful Interest upon it. This Me∣thod of Leasing appeared upon all Accounts, to be the most Advantageous both for Landlord and Te∣nant. The Rents were secured to the College in the best Manner, and they were free from the Trou∣ble and Charge of Inspection and Reparation. And the Tenants had all possible Encouragement to cul∣tivate and improve the Lands, as their own. And the Rents were much higher than most other Lands were leased for, altho' cleared and fenced; tho' pos∣sibly in future Times they may seem low. Upon these Terms sundry Parcels were leased out, from Time to Time, as there was opportunity.</P>
<P>The Farm at <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> given by Bishop <HI>Berkeley,</HI> in pursuance to the Advice of the Rev. Mr. <HI>George Berkeley,</HI> the worthy Son of the Donor, was in the Year 1762 leased to Captain <HI>John Whiting,</HI> for the Term of 999 Years; upon the same Conditions with the other College Lands, before-mentioned. The

<P>The College was in an agreeable and happy State, in most Respects, but had for many Years been un∣der, some Difficulties and Disadvantages with Re∣gard to Religion. The Corporation in the Year 1746, Voted, <Q>That they would choose a publick Professor of Divinity in the College, as soon as they could procure a sufficient Support.</Q> In the Year 1752,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1752</NOTE> the Necessity appearing to be greater, they Voted, <Q>That a Professor of Divinity in the College would be upon all Accounts Advantageous, and therefore <HI>resolved, that they</HI> would endeavour to get a Sup∣port for such a Professor, as soon as may be; by all such Ways and Means as Prudence should di∣rect: And afterwards, ordered, that one half of the College Lands, in the County of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> should be leased out for that Purpose.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1753 <HI>Octo.</HI></NOTE>The General Assembly resolved, <Q>that one prin∣cipal End proposed in erecting the College was to supply the Churches in this Colony with a learned, pious and orthodox Ministry; to which End it was requisite that the Students of the College should have the best Instructions in Divinity, and the best Patterns of Preaching, set before them. And that the Settling a Learned Pious, and Orthodox Pro∣fessor of Divinity in the College, would greatly tend to promote that good End and Design. And therefore recommended a general Contribution to be made in all the Religious Societies in the Co∣lony,

<P>WHEREAS the principal Design of the pious FOUNDERS of this College was to educate and train up Youth for the Ministry, in the Churches of this Colony, according to the Doctrine, Discipline and Mode of Worship received and practised in them; and they particularly ordered, that the Students
<PB N="62" REF="010262_0065_0F7E4889B9C108C0"/>
should be established in the Principles of Religion, and grounded in polemical Divinity, according to the <HI>Assembly's Catechism,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames</HI>'s <HI>Medulla,</HI> and <HI>Ca∣ses of Conscience,</HI> and that special Care should be taken, in the Education of Students, not to suffer them to be instructed in any different Principles or Doctrines; and that all proper Measures should be taken to promote the Power and Purity of Reli∣gion, and the best Edification and Peace of these Churches.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Anno</HI> 1698, 1701, <HI>and</HI> 1722.</NOTE></P>
<P>We the Successors of the said Founders, being in our own Judgments, of the same Principles in Religion with our Predecessors, and esteeming our∣selves bound in Fidelity to the Trust committed to us, to carry on the same Design, and improve all the College Estate descended to us, for the Purposes for which it was given, do explicitly and fully resolve, as follows, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Scriptures of the Old and New Tes∣taments are the only Rule of Faith and Practice, in all Matters of Religion, and the Standard by which all Doctrines, Principles and Practices in Religion are to be tried and judged.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Assembly's Catechism</HI> and the <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> received and established in the Churches of this Colony, (which is an Abridgement of the <HI>Westminster Confession</HI>) contain a true and just Sum∣mary of the most important Doctrines of the Chris∣tian Religion; and that the true Sense of the sa∣cred Scriptures is justly collected and summed up in these Compositions: And all Expositions of Scrip∣ture, pretending to deduce any Doctrines or Posi∣tions
<PB N="63" REF="010262_0066_0F7E488A6C64BF00"/>
contrary to the Doctrines laid down in these Composures, we are of Opinion are wrong and er∣roneous.</P>
<P N="3">3. If any Doubt or Dispute should happen to arise about the true Meaning and Sense of any par∣ticular Terms or Phrases in the said Composures, they shall be understood and taken in the same Sense in which such Terms and Phrases have been generally used in the Writings of Protestant Di∣vines, and especially in their public Confessions of Faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. That we will always take all proper and rea∣sonable Measures, such as Christian Prudence shall direct, to continue and propagate the Doctrines con∣tained in these Summaries of Religion, in this Col∣lege, and transmit them to all future Successions and Generations; and to use the like Measures to prevent the contrary Doctrines from prevailing in this Society.</P>
<P N="5">5. That every Person who shall hereafter be chosen a President, Fellow, Professor of Divinity, or Tutor, in this College, shall before he enters upon the Execution of his Office, publickly give his Consent to the said <HI>Catechism</HI> and <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> as containing a just Summary of the Christian Reli∣gion, as before expressed; and renounce all Doc∣trines or Principles contrary thereunto; and shall pass through such an Examination as the Corpo∣ration shall think proper, in order to their being fully satisfied that he shall do it truly, without any Evasion or Equivocation.</P>
<P N="6">6. That since every such Officer is admitted into his Post upon the Condition aforesaid, if he shall afterwards change his Sentiments, entertain any con∣trary Set of Principles or Scheme of Religion, and
<PB N="64" REF="010262_0067_0F7E488B25EFAB80"/>
disbelieve the Doctrines contained in the said Cate∣chism or Confession of Faith, he cannot, consistent with common Honesty and Fidelity, continue in his Post, but is bound to resign it.</P>
<P N="7">7. That when it is suspected by any of the Cor∣poration, that any such Officer is fallen from the Profession of his Faith, as before-mentioned, and is gone into any contrary Scheme of Principles, he shall be examined by the Corporation.</P>
<P N="8">8. That inasmuch as it is especially necessary, that a Professor of Divinity should be found in the Faith; besides the common Tests before mentioned, he shall publickly exhibit a full Confession of his Faith, drawn up by him in his own Words and Phrases, and shall in full and express Terms re∣nounce all such Errors as shall in any considera∣ble Measure prevail at the Time of his Introduction. And if any Doubt or Question should arise about any Doctrine or Position, whether it be Truth or Error, it shall be judged by the Word of God taken in that Sense of it which is contained and declared in the said Catechism and Confession of Faith; as being a just Exposition of the Word of God in those Doctrines or Articles which are con∣tained in them.</P>
<P N="9">9. That every Person who shall be chosen Pre∣sident, Fellow, Professor of Divinity or Tutor in this College, shall give his Consent to the Rules of Church Discipline established in the Ecclesiasti∣cal Constitution of the Churches of this Colony: It being understood, that our Ecclesiastical Consti∣tution may admit of Additions or Alterations, in such Circumstances as according to our Confession of Faith are to be regulated by the Light of Na∣ture, and the Rules of Christian Prudence. And
<PB N="65" REF="010262_0068_0F7E488BE1DD20E0"/>
it is especially declared, that if any Person shall deny the Validity of the Ordination of the Minis∣ters of this Colony, commonly called <HI>Presbyterian</HI> or <HI>Congregational,</HI> or shall hold, that it is neces∣sary or convenient that such Ministers should be re-ordained, in order to render their Administra∣tions <HI>valid,</HI> it shall be deemed an essential Depar∣ture from our ecclesiastical Constitution; and incon∣sistent with the Intentions of the Founders of this College, that such a Person should be chosen an Officer in it.</P>
<P N="10">10. Yet, we would suppose, that it is not incon∣sistent with the general Design of the Founders, and is agreeable to our own Inclinations, to admit Pro∣testants of all Denominations to send their Children to receive the Advantage of an Education in this College: Provided that while they are here, they conform to all the Laws and Orders of it.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="confession of faith">
<HEAD>All the <HI>Fellows,</HI> who have been admitted, since this Act, have publickly given their Consent to the <HI>Ca∣techism,</HI> and <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> in this <HI>Formula,</HI> viz.</HEAD>
<P>I A.

<P><PB N="67" REF="010262_0070_0F7E48900F885180"/>In September 1755 the Corporation nominated the Rev. Mr. <HI>Naphtali Daggett,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1755</NOTE> Pastor of a Church on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> to be <HI>Professor of Divinity.</HI> Upon Appli∣cation made to the Presbytery he was dismiss'd from his Charge; and in November following came and preached in the College-Hall to good Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The President and Fellows met March 3, 1756,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1756</NOTE> and spent a Day in examining Mr. <HI>Daggett,</HI> as to his Principles of Religion, his Knowledge and Skill in Divinity, Cases of Conscience, Scripture History and Chronology, Antiquity, Skill in the Hebrew Tongue, and various other Qualifications for a Professor; in all which he acquitted himself to the good Satisfac∣tion of the Corporation. The next Day he preached a Sermon in the College-Hall, upon that Text, 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> II. 2; and gave his full and explicit Con∣sent to all the Doctrines contained in our Catechism and Confession of Faith, and to the Rules of Church Discipline established in the Churches of this Colony. And also exhibited a full Confession of his Faith, of his own Composure; and expressly renounced the principal Errors prevailing in these Times; according to the Act of the Corporation, before recited. Then he was by the Corporation, inaugurated and installed <HI>Professor of Divinity,</HI> in this College; with nearly the same Solemnities and Formalities, as are usual at the Instalment of other Ministers, who have been before ordained. All which are particularly entered in the Records of the College.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gershom Clark,</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Graduated</HI> 1743.</NOTE> generously gave 33 Pounds 10 Shillings Sterling to be put out to Interest, for the Use of the Professor of Divinity.
<PB N="68" REF="010262_0071_0F7E4890635C71C8"/>
The Interest of which together with the Interest of Mr. <HI>Livingston</HI>'s Donation before-mentioned, and the Rents of the College Lands agreed to be leased, were sufficient for the annual Support of the <HI>Professor.</HI></P>
<P>The President having before given a Lot of Land, for the Use of a Professor of Divinity, for the Time being, who should be settled and continued according to the Act of the Corporation, November 21, 1753, and constantly preach in the College-Hall or Chapel, except in Vacations: <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">By Deed dated September <HI>10, 1756.</HI></NOTE> Sundry generous and princi∣pal Gentlemen came into a Subscription, or Contri∣bution for Building a House for the Professor, under the like Limitations. The House was raised in June 1757;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1757</NOTE> completely finished the next Summer; and cost 285 Pounds Sterling. The President in the Presence of a considerable Number of Gentlemen, with all proper Formalities, put the Professor into the Pos∣session of the House; declaring that it was built, for the Use of a Professor of Divinity, in the College, who should hold and preach all the Doctrines con∣tained in our Catechism and Confession of Faith; and in Case he, or his Successors should hold, teach or maintain any contrary Doctrine, he or they would have no Right to any Use or Improvement of it, &amp;c. And the Solemnity was concluded with Prayer and Singing a Psalm. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>August</HI> 28, 1758.</NOTE></P>
<P>At a Meeting of the President and Fellows June 29, 1757. The Tutors and a Number of the Stu∣dents made Application as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS this Rev. Corporation of their paternal Care and Goodness, have settled a Professor of Divinity in this Ecclesiastical Society, whom we
<PB N="69" REF="010262_0072_0F7E4891477846F8"/>
receive as an able Minister of the New-Testament; We the Subscribers, Members of this Society, hav∣ing been admitted Members in full Communion in sundry Churches, and consenting to the Ecclesiasti∣cal Constitution of the Churches of this Colony, as agreeable to the Word of God in Doctrine and Dis∣cipline; are desirous to attend upon the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, under the Administration of the Rev. Professor; and to walk together in stated Christian Communion and holy Subjection to all the Ordinances of Christ; and desire the Approbation and Sanction of this Rev. Body.</Q></P>
<P>This was approved of by the Corporation; and a Sermon was preached in the Hall by the Professor; and all proper Solemnities attended upon this Occa∣sion. And the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is accordingly administred in the College-Hall, or Cha∣pel, on the first Lord's Day in each Month; agree∣able to the Practice of the Colleges in <HI>England.</HI> By all which the State and Constitution of the College was rendred more perfect and agreable; tho' not pleasing to some particular Gentlemen of different Sentiments.</P>
<P>In May 1763, nine Gentlemen preferred a Memo∣rial to the Honorable the General Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763</NOTE> wherein they represented, that the General Assembly were the <HI>Founders of the College;</HI> and as such, had right to appoint <HI>Visitors,</HI> to reform Abuses if any were found. Which right the Memoralists suggested, ought to be seasonably, and most explicitly vindicated and asserted: or otherwise the College might become too independent. And therefore prayed, that the said Assembly, would pass an Act, to authorize an Appeal, from any and every Sentence given by the Authority of the Col∣lege,
<PB N="70" REF="010262_0073_0F7E48920E3FB098"/>
to the Governor and Council of this Colony; for the Time being. And that the said Assembly would immediately issue forth a <HI>Commission of Visitation,</HI> enabling some suitable Persons to inquire into all the Affairs of said College, and either of themselves rec∣tify all Abuses, which they may discover; or make Report of what they shall find, with their Opinions thereon, to the said Assembly at their next Session.</P>
<P>The Counsel for the Memoralists alledged, that the General Assembly <HI>founded</HI> the College by giving a Charter, in the Year 1701: which contained a Do∣nation of about Sixty Pounds Sterling, to be annually paid out of the publick Treasury; and by sundry subsequent Donations, especially five Tracts of Land in the Year 1732. And that the present Assembly, as Successors to the Founders, had a right of Visitation, by the Common Law. They further alledged, that such an Appeal, and Visitation were very necessary to preserve the good Order and Regulation of the College, upon all Accounts, and particularly to pre∣serve <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> in Religion.</P>
<P>To which the President replied;</P>
<P>That the General Assembly, in their Legislative Capacity, have the same Authority over the College, and all the Persons and Estates belonging to it; as they have over all other Persons and Estates in the Colony; and all that Power which is necessary for the good of the College, or the general Good of the Community. And that an especial Respect and Gratitude is due to them, as the <HI>greatest Benefactors;</HI> yet they are not to be considered as <HI>Founders</HI> or <HI>Visi∣tors</HI> in the Sense of the Common Law. That the <HI>first</HI> Trustees, Undertakers and Inspectors, who were nominated by the Ministers with the general Consent of the People, and by Compact, became a Society or
<PB N="71" REF="010262_0074_0F7E4892A5C36B60"/>
<HI>Quasi Corporation</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> says) near two Years before they had a Charter, were the <HI>Founders</HI> of the College; and that they formed it, by making a large and formal Donation of Books; above a Year before they had a Charter from the Government. That the College had a Being, not only in <HI>fieri</HI> in the Purpose and Intention of the Undertakers (as Lord <HI>Coke</HI> says) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke 10 <HI>Rep.</HI></NOTE> but in <HI>esse</HI> by the Donation of Books, Money and Land actually made to it, before it <HI>had a Charter. That</HI> Major <HI>Fitch</HI> of <HI>Norwich,</HI> made a Donation, in Writing, to the Undertakers, of Six Hundred Acres of Land, and some Materials to build a College House, in the Time of the sitting of the Assembly, some Days before the Charter was given. And this Donation he made to the Collegiate School, as <Q><HI>already set up by the great Pains and Charges of the Ministers.</HI></Q> That the King, by giving a Licence to found a College, does not thereby, in Law, become the Founder <HI>in Sensu Dotationis.</HI> And that he is the Founder only of those Colleges or Hospitals, to which he makes the <HI>first</HI> Donation for founding. My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> distinguishes between <HI>Fundator Incipiens</HI> and <HI>Fun∣dator Perficiens;</HI> and says, that he only is the Foun∣der <HI>quoad Dotationem,</HI> (to whose Heirs or Successors the Law gives a Right of <HI>Visitation</HI>) who makes the FIRST DONATION. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Coke 10 <HI>Reports.</HI></NOTE> And the Right of Visitation arises in Law, from the Interest which the Founder has in the College or Hospital by his Donation.</P>
<P>For if it be essentially perverted from the Design for which it was given, the Donation becomes void, and reverts to the Donor or his Heirs. That the first Donation <HI>only</HI> creates the <HI>Founder;</HI> and all subse∣quent Donations are presumed in Law to be given up∣on
<PB N="72" REF="010262_0075_0F7E489364AC84F0"/>
the same End and Design with the first, unless some particular Limitation be expressly made.</P>
<P>That if a common Person makes a Donation to found a College or Hospital, tho' ever so small, and the King afterwards endows it with large Possessions, yet the common Person is the Founder and not the King. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wood's <HI>Institutes.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>That a <HI>Licence</HI> to found, and a <HI>Charter</HI> of Incor∣poration, are in their own Nature distinct; and either may be first, in Law, yet they are often Times both contained in the same Instrument; and may either preceed or succeed the first fundamental Donation.</P>
<P>When the fundamental Donation is made before the Licence to found, there the Licence is only a formal and explicit Confirmation from the Crown, of what was before done by the general Licence given by the Common and Statute Law; whereby every Man may give his Estate, for publick, pious and cha∣ritable Uses; upon such Conditions and Regulations, as he shall see Cause. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See <HI>39</HI> Eliz. C. <HI>5,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Laws.</NOTE> And the Feoffees in trust, are the legal Proprietors of such Donations; accord∣ing to the Conditions and Limitations with which they are made. And have a legal Right to hold and lease; and to dispose of the Profits as a <HI>quasi Corporation,</HI> for those particular Purposes. And may, by a long Course of stated and regular Conduct, become a <HI>complete</HI> legal Corporation, by <HI>Prescription.</HI> And the King's Charter or Licence only makes or declares that to be a legal Corporation, <HI>at the first,</HI> which may become such, by <HI>immemorial Usage</HI> and Custom.</P>
<P>In a Licence to found, the Words FOUND, ERECT or any other Words of the like Import, are indif∣ferent
<PB N="73" REF="010262_0076_0F7E48946FF392E0"/>
in Law; and sufficient to make a Foundation; And in the first Charter or Grant to the College, these Words are promiscuously used, and applied to the <HI>first Trustees only.</HI> The first Charter plainly sup∣poses ten Trustees, Partners or Undertakers <HI>antecedently</HI> existing; and a School <HI>already founded, in fact,</HI> (tho' not <HI>fully</HI> and <HI>completely</HI> so in <HI>Law</HI>) by Donation of Lands, Goods, and Monies, <HI>before given;</HI> and therefore gives them a <HI>full</HI> legal Right, Liberty and Privilege to proceed, in erecting, endowing and governing the School; which they had a general and imperfect Right to do by the Common Law. And the Charter declares them to be in a legal Capacity to <Q>demand, have, hold, and possess all such Lands, Goods and Monies as have <HI>heretofore</HI> been given, (as well as those which might hereafter be given) for the founding, erecting and endowing the said School.</Q></P>
<P>And there is no Intimation, that their giving to the first Trustees, a Right to receive Sixty Pounds out of the publick Treasury, a Year after, and an∣nually, and to improve it, at their Discretion, for the Good of the School, should be deemed the <HI>sounding</HI> of it; to be sure not in such a Sense as to annul the former Foundation; much less could any Endowments made thirty Years after, make them the Founders in the Sense of the Common Law. Besides the Preamble to the Charter of 1745, expressly says, that the first Trustees <HI>founded</HI> the College.</P>
<P>It was further observed, that an <Q>Appeal from all and every Sentence given by the Authority of College; to the Governor and Council of this Colony, for the Time being,</Q> (as proposed in the Memorial,) would retard and obstruct all the Proceedings of the Authority of College. It being found, by universal Experience, that in all Instances, wherein a Liberty
<PB N="74" REF="010262_0077_0F7E4894E0E97210"/>
of Appeal is allowed, the Judgment appealed from, is of no Force or Efficacy; except that which may arise from the extraordinary Trouble and Charge of bringing the Case to a Trial, in the Court ap∣pealed to. That such a Constitution would take the Government of the College wholly out of the Hands of those, in whom it was originally vested; and be contrary to the Charter. That such a universal Li∣berty of Appeals, especially in criminal Cases, is not allowed in any Community whatsoever; and that those few Cases in which Appeals are allowed in some other Colleges, are under peculiar Conditions and Restrictions.</P>
<P>It was also observed that the Power of <HI>Visitation</HI> is, by the Common Law, expressly limited to the <HI>Statutes of the Founder;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Raymond</HI>'s Reports, Vol. I. P. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> which are the Conditions or Limitations of the Use of the Founder's Dona∣tion; and the Visitor can do nothing but rectify those Things which are plainly repugnant to those Limitations; or claim a Forfeiture. But as no such Statutes, made by the General Assembly, can be found; such Visitors would have no Power at all, or be altogether arbitrary, like the Visitors sent to <HI>Magdalen</HI> College, by King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>If it should be supposed, that there is any Need of any Overseers, under the Name and Title of <HI>Visitors;</HI> the first Trustees and their Successors, may properly be denominated such: And in the first Plan of the College, they are expressly called <HI>Inspectors.</HI> That to have Visitors over Visitors or Inspectors, would make endless Trouble and Confusion. That Matters of Property must be determined by the stated, execu∣tive Courts, according to the Course of the Com∣mon
<PB N="75" REF="010262_0078_0F7E48987471C418"/>
Law; but to erect any new Kind of Court over the Affairs of the College, which are committed to the President and Fellows, would be an Infringement on their Charter. Though the General Assembly still retain such a supreme Power, as that if there should be any plain <HI>Breach of Trust,</HI> cognizable by a <HI>Court of Chancery,</HI> or any such Misconduct in the Corpora∣tion, as should be plainly detrimental to the pub∣lick Good, they may rectify it in their legislative Capacity.</P>
<P>As to the Advantage of Visitors to preserve <HI>Or∣thodoxy</HI> in the Governors of the College;</P>
<P>The President observed, that whatever was the Oc∣casion, or Design of that Argument, he was glad that such an important Point was moved. That it was well known, that the President and Fellows or Trustees have from the Beginning, shewn a proper Care and Zeal to preserve Orthodoxy in all the Go∣vernors of the College; and to such a Degree, as to be disagreable to some Gentlemen of late; who have thereupon endeavoured to obstruct the Government, and flourishing State of the College. That the Or∣thodoxy of the College was settled and secured upon the best Foundation, that human Wisdom, directed by the general Rules of God's Word, could devise. That according to the original Design of the Found∣ing of the College, the President, Fellows, Professor of Divinity, and Tutors, are to be admitted upon Con∣dition of their Consent to the <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> agreed upon by the Churches in the Colony, Anno 1708, and established by the Laws of the Government. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See Anno <HI>1753.</HI></NOTE> That there is not the like Security of the Ortho∣doxy of <HI>Visitors</HI> or any other in the civil Order,

<P><HI>See</HI> Dunlop<HI>'s Preface to the Westminster Confession, P.</HI> 63.</P></NOTE> And as the Governors of the College are satisfied that the Body of this Honorable Assembly is fully orthodox, and so are intirely easy under their Su∣perintendency; relying principally upon the Care of the great Head of Church; yet they can't have the like Security of any other Order of Men, which may be substituted by them. And one principal Reason why they oppose all <HI>Innovations</HI> in the Constitution and Government of the College, is, lest they might hereafter, have an ill Influence upon the Orthodoxy of it; which the President and Fellows, according to the Trust reposed in them, by the Founders and by the General Assembly, are fully determined to maintain and preserve to the Utmost of their Power.</P>
<P>When these Arguments were considered by the Honorable the General Assembly, but very few ap∣peared to be of the Opinion, that the Assembly
<PB N="77" REF="010262_0080_0F7E48999229FE70"/>
were the <HI>Founders</HI> of the College; and so they acted nothing upon the Memorial. And it is generally sup∣posed that this Question will never be publickly moved again.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jared Eliot,</HI> of <HI>Killingworth,</HI> in his last Will, gave Seven Pounds and Ten Shillings, Ster. to be put out to Interest; and the Interest thereof to be expended in purchasing Books for the Library from Time to Time, at the Discretion of the Pre∣sident and Fellows.</P>
<P>The Number of Students, for near ten Years past being about 170, it became extremely inconvenient to carry on all religious and scholastick Exercises in the old <HI>College-Hall;</HI> and to make Use of it for a Dining-Room.</P>
<P>The Library was also too small for the Books and Apparatus. The President therefore proposed a Scheme to build a new <HI>Hall</HI> or <HI>Chapel,</HI> with a Li∣brary over it: And set forward a Subscription for that Purpose: the Foundation was laid in April 1761, and the Outside was nearly finished that Summer: It is built of Brick, fifty Feet long, and forty Feet wide, with a Steeple and Galleries, in which are three Rostra for Orations, Disputations, &amp;c. and a Library over the whole. It is set near the South End of the Brick College, with a View that when another Col∣lege is built, it will be set near the South Side of the Chapel. In June 1763, it was opened with a Ser∣mon preached by the Professor, in the Presence of the President and Fellows, and a large Number of other Gentlemen. And the President and Fellows voted, <Q>that the <HI>Chapel</HI> should hereafter be used for the Religious and Scholastick Meetings and Exercises,
<PB N="78" REF="010262_0081_0F7E489A25DB8F10"/>
for which the old <HI>College-Hall</HI> has been used here∣tofore.</Q>
The Conveniencies of it have been found to be very many and great.</P>

<P>It is not finished withinside; but only a Desk and some Seats are set up for present Use. As we have now nothing in the College Treasury but only the Donations of Messrs. <HI>Nougier, Livingston</HI> and <HI>Clark,</HI> which are appropriated to special Uses, as before∣mentioned, we must hope and wait for the further Help and Assistance of some generous Gentlemen.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Jackson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Member of Parliament and Agent for the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> has very gene∣rously given One Hundred Pounds, towards finishing the Chapel.</P>
<P>And some Gentlemen in <HI>New-Haven,</HI> have gene∣rously subscribed considerable towards erecting a Spire upon it, for an Ornament to the Town, as well as the Chapel. The larger of these Subscriptions will be in the List of Donations.</P>
<P>The Rev. Dr. <HI>Timothy Cutler,</HI> formerly Rector of this College, died in August 1765: He was educated at <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and graduated there in 1701.

After his Removal he went to <HI>England,</HI> and took Episco∣pal Orders, and received the Degree of <HI>Doctor of
<PB N="79" REF="010262_0082_0F7E489AE722D450"/>
Divinity,</HI> from both the Universities of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge:</HI> and afterwards was Rector of Christ-Church in <HI>Boston,</HI> about 40 Years. He was a Gentleman of superior natural Powers and Learning; had enter∣tained a high Opinion of the Constitution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and was zealously attached to it. His Character is given at large, in a funeral Ser∣mon, preached by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry Caner,</HI> of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>AN APPENDIX,</HI> Containing the present State of the College; the Method of Instruction and Government; and a List of Officers, Be∣nefactors and Graduates.</HEAD>
<P>THIS College is under the Government of a Presi∣dent and ten Fellows; who are some of the prin∣cipal Ministers, in the several Parts of the Colony: And ordinarily meet on the second Wednesday in September, annually, and on special Emergencies; to confer Degrees, settle the College Accounts, appoint subordinate Officers, make Laws, and direct in the general and more important Affairs of the College.</P>
<P>The President has the principal Care and Business of instructing and governing the Students; with the Assistance of a Professor of Divinity, and three Tu∣tors. The President every Morning and Evening, reads and expounds a Chapter in the Bible, and prays in the Chapel; at which all the Students are obliged to attend. After Evening Prayers, he fre∣quently makes Dissertations upon various Subjects in Religion and Learning, and almost all the different Affairs and Employments of Life.</P>
<P>The Professor of Divinity preaches Sermons in the Chapel, every Lord's-Day, in the Course of a Body of Divinity, Doctrinal and Practical; and occasional
<PB N="81" REF="010262_0084_0F7E489C63331FA8"/>
Discourses or Lectures, at other Times; and frequently gives private Counsel and Instruction.</P>
<P>The Number of undergraduate Students, for many Years past, has been about One Hundred and Se∣venty; but by Reason of the distressing Difficulties which the Country has been under, of late, the Number has been diminished, for two or three Years past. They are divided into four Classes; according to the respective Years, in which they were admitted. Each Class is under the immediate Instruction of a particular Tutor; who carries them thro' a Course of Studies, for three Years; and the President com∣pletes their Instruction in the fourth. At their Ad∣mission they are able well to construe and parse <HI>Tully</HI>'s Orations, <HI>Virgil</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> Testament; and understand the Rules of common Arithmetick. In the first Year, they learn <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and principally pursue the Study of the Languages, and make a Beginning in Logick, and some Parts of the Ma∣thematicks. In the second Year, they study the Languages; but principally recite Logick, Rhetorick, Oratory, Geography and natural Philosophy: And some of them make good Proficiency in Trigono∣metry and Algebra. In the third Year, they still pursue the Study of natural Philosophy; and most Branches of the Mathematicks: Many of them well understand Surveying, Navigation and the Calcula∣tion of the Eclipses; and some of them are con∣siderable Proficients in Conic Sections and Fluxions. In the fourth Year they principally study and recite Metaphysicks, Ethicks and Divinity. In reciting any Book upon the Arts and Sciences, the Tutor asks them Questions upon all the principal Points and Propositions in it; and they give such Answers, as shew whether they understand it; and the Tutor
<PB N="82" REF="010262_0085_0F7E489D4D0B0128"/>
explains it, as far as there is Occasion. In all De∣lineations and Calculations, a select Number, with proper Instruments in their Hands, are instructed at a Table.</P>
<P>The two upper Classes exercise their Powers in disputing every Monday in the Syllogistick Form, and every Tuesday in the Forensick; which gives a grea∣ter Scope to their Genius, and is better adapted to the common Use and Practice of Mankind, in the Con∣duct of publick Affairs. In these Disputes we often hear a Summary of the best Arguments which can be produced out of any Author, on both Sides of a dis∣puted Question.</P>
<P>When they have alternately gone through all their Arguments, the Moderator recapitulates those which seem to be the most plausible on each Side, shews their real Force or Weakness, and gives his Opinion upon the Whole. The Questions are taken from every Subject, which occurs in the whole Circle of Litera∣ture, and upon almost all the doubtful Points, which have been publickly disputed among Mankind.</P>
<P>Twice a Week five or six deliver a Declamation memoriter from the oratorical Rostrum; the Presi∣dent makes some Observations upon the Manner of Delivery and sometimes upon the Subject; and some∣times gives some small Laurel to him who best acts the Part of an Orator. These Declamations are be∣forehand supervised by their Tutor, who corrects the Othography and Punctuation. There are also two Orations made every Quarter-Day, upon Examina∣tions, and frequently on special Occasions. And to train them up to an agreable Stile and Method of Writing, the President directs them, that when any one has Business of special Importance with him, they should make Application in the Form of a Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="010262_0086_0F7E48A0A04955C8"/>Special Care is taken to form the Morals of the Youth; to keep them (as much as may be) from all Excesses and Extravagancies; from all vain Af∣fectations of Show, which occasion unnecessary Ex∣pences and divert their Minds from the Pursuit of those Things which are of greater Importance; to instil into their Minds true Notions of Honor, Po∣liteness, and a Love of Virtue: And to impress upon them a Sense, that the End of their Creation, and of all their special Advantages, is not ultimately for themselves, or their own Sakes; but to qualify them for the special Service of God; and to render them most useful to their Fellow-Men.</P>
<P>Above all, Care is taken to instil into their Minds, the Principles of true Religion, in Doctrine and Pra∣tice, by publick and private Discourses and personal Conversations. To this End they are obliged to attend the publick Worship of God in the Chapel every Lord's-Day, and Morning and Evening Pray∣ers; at which, Occasion is frequently taken, from the Portion of Scripture read, to excite them to some particular Duty, and to Caution them against some particular Sin.</P>
<P>The Sons of those, who prosess themselves to be Episcopalians, have Liberty to go out on the Lord's-Day, and at other Times, to attend on the Mode of Worship in which they were educated, as often as will not be an Infraction on the general Rules of Or∣der in the College. Persons of all Denominations of Protestants are allowed the Advantage of an Educa∣tion here, and no Inquiry has been made, at their Admission or afterwards, about their particular Sen∣timents in Religion. Yet, if it should manifestly ap∣pear, that any should take Pains to infect the Minds of their Fellow-Students with such pernicious Errors,
<PB N="84" REF="010262_0087_0F7E48A18DFC1400"/>
as are contrary to the Fundamentals of Christianity, and the special Design of founding this College, so that Parents should justly be afraid of venturing their Children here, it is probable that some Notice would be taken of it. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Act of the Trustees <HI>1722,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Honorable the General Assembly in May <HI>1742.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The principal Design of the Institution of this Col∣lege, was to educate Persons for the Work of the Ministry; which Design has been so far succeeded as that above Four Hundred worthy Ministers have re∣ceived their Education here, of which 40 have been episcopally ordained, and four of them have been judged qualified for the Degree of <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> by the Universities in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Yet inasmuch as more have been educated, than are necessary for the immediate Service of the Churches, and are de∣signed for various other publick and important Sta∣tions in civil Life; the President therefore frequently makes publick Dissertations upon every Subjects neces∣sary to be understood, to qualify young Gentlemen for those various Stations and Employments; such as the Nature of civil Government, the civil Constitu∣tion of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the various Kinds of Courts, and Officers superior and inferior, the several Kinds of Laws by which the Kingdom is governed; as the Statute, Common, Civil, Canon, Military and Maritime Laws; together with their several various Origins and Extents; the several Forms of Ecclesiastical Govern∣ment which have obtained in the Christian Church; ancient History and Chronology, the Nature and Form of obligatory Writings and Instruments, Agriculture, Commerce, Navigation, with some general Sketches upon Physick, Anatomy, Heraldry and Gunnery, so
<PB N="85" REF="010262_0088_0F7E48A2CF869818"/>
far as it falls under the Rules of Philosophy and Ma∣thematicks; that so every one educated here might have, at least, a general and superficial Knowledge of every important Affair of Life; and be directed to those Books which may give him a more complete Knowledge of that particular Art and Science, which may be most agreable to his own Genius or Profession.</P>
<P>Almost all the Students reside in the College, and are boarded by the Steward in the Hall, after the Manner of common Families without any Restriction of Weight or Measure; for which they pay 4<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Week Sterling. This Provision is generally agre∣able, so that the Tutors always, the President fre∣quently, the Fellows, and many other Gentlemen, occasionally are entertained with it.</P>
<P>The undergraduate Students also pay for Tuition and Instruction 9 Shillings, for the Rent of their Chambers and Studies 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 2<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for Repairs and other con∣tingent Charges One Shilling Sterling, per Quarter: Which Sums are collected by the Steward, and paid out by Order from the President and Fellows. After the necessary incident Charges are deducted, the Re∣sidue is applied for the Payment of the Salaries of the Officers, which of late Years have been to the President £. 110, to each of the three Tutors £. 43, and to the Senior Tutor, who is Keeper of the Li∣brary, £. 6 Sterling more. Altho' those Salaries are scanty enough, yet inasmuch as the Incomes are now lessened by Reason of the Poverty of the Country, and the Diminution of the Number of Students, it is feared, that either the Salaries, or the Number of the Officers must be diminished, either of which will be inconvenient.</P>
<P>In the Exercise of Discipline, Care is taken to impress the Minds of the Students with a Sense of
<PB N="86" REF="010262_0089_0F7E48A33208AF70"/>
the Amiableness of Virtue and the odious Nature of all Vice and Disorder, and the Reasonableness of ob∣serving all the Laws and Orders of the Society, from a Principle of Choice, Virtue and Honor. In those Instances where these Motives have not their desired Influence, and any are guilty of Misdemeanors of a lesser Kind, they are reprimanded, or punished with some small Fine, as a Prelude or Earnest of a greater Punishment, if they persist in doing the like: If they do persist, and are guilty of some greater Crime, they are publickly admonished or rusticated, for some Months. If they are guilty of an habitual Course of Idleness and Negligence in their Studies and Attendance on Prayers and Recitations; or if they are guilty of a Course of any considerable Crimes, after lesser Punishments, they are rusticated for a Year, and put back in the next Class, or wholly dismissed from being Members of College. And if they are guilty of gross Immoralities, or any Crimes of a hei∣nous and atrocious Nature, destructive to the Soci∣ety, they are expelled. When any of these greater Punishments are publickly inflicted upon any, the President makes a solemn Address to the Rest, to im∣press upon their Minds a Sense of the evil Na∣ture and Consequence of such <HI>Crimes,</HI> and to persuade them to take Warning not to do the like.</P>
<P>We have a good Library, consisting of about 4000 Volumes, well furnished with ancient Authors; such as the Fathers, Historians, and Classicks, many mo∣dern valuable Books of Divinity, History, Philosophy, and Mathematicks, but not many Authors who have wrote within these 30 Years.—We have a good Air-Pump, Set of Globes, Telescope, small Astro∣nomical Quadrant, Microscope, Thermometer, The∣odolite,
<PB N="87" REF="010262_0090_0F7E48A3E1D06710"/>
and an electrical Machine: but no other Ap∣paratus, of any great Consequence.</P>
<P>The Students enjoy all necessary Means of Instruc∣tion; and are under the Advantage of geting all that valuable and useful Knowledge, which they can, or will acquire in the Space of four Years.</P>
<P>In order to discover their Proficiency, and to excite them to a laudable Ambition to excel, there is a publick Examination of each Class, about once a Quarter; with Orations or Speeches pertinent to the Occasion. In July, annually, there is a formal Examination of the Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, in the Languages, Arts and Sci∣ences; and in the whole Circle of Academical Lite∣rature: which is carried on publickly in the Cha∣pel, by the Tutors and any other Gentlemen, of a liberal Education, who see cause to join with them. After Examination, the Candidates are severally put to Vote, by the Moderator, whether they are qua∣lified for a Degree? And they accordingly return a formal Certificate to the President. In some In∣stances, Compassion has had a great Influence. On this Occasion, several pertinent Speeches are made, in Latin, by the President and Tutors; and two publick Orations, by the Candidates: the one to give a Specimen of their Knowledge in the several Branches of Academical Literature: and the other to give a grateful and pathetick Valediction to all the Officers and Members of the Society. The Law obliges all the Candidates for the Degree of Mas∣ter of Arts to attend before the Commencement, and give some Specimen of their Proficiency in Know∣ledge: but this has been two generally dispensed with.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="010262_0091_0F7E48A5101EF018"/>The publick Commencement is ordinarily on the second Wednesday in September annually: at which there is a large Assembly, consisting of the Presi∣dent and Fellows, a great Number of Ministers, and other learned and superior Gentlemen. The Presi∣dent begins the Solemnity with Prayer, one of the Candidates, for the first Degree, makes a salutatory Oration to the Governor and Council, the Officers of College, and the whole Assembly: the others give a Specimen of their Learning, by disputing Syllogistically on the Questions, printed in their The∣ses; which are then distributed. The like is done in the Afternoon by the Candidates for the Degree of Master of Arts. Then the President, with the Consent of the Fellows, gives them their Degrees, three at a Time, in this Form:</P>
<P>PRO Auctoritate mihi commissa, admitto vos ad Primum Gradum in artibus; pro More Academi∣arum in Anglia. Vobisque trado hunc Librum, una cum Potestate publice Praelegendi, quotiescunque ad isthoc Munus evocati fueritis: cujus, haec in∣strumenta, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The President delivers to each of them a <HI>Diploma.</HI></NOTE> membrano scripta, Testimonio sint.</P>
<P>The like Form is used for the <HI>Masters,</HI> only in∣stead of <HI>Primum,</HI> it is, <HI>Secundum:</HI> and instead of <HI>Prae∣legendi,</HI> it is, <HI>Profitendi;</HI> and sometimes, instead of <HI>Pri∣mum,</HI> the President says, <HI>Gradum Baccalaureatus;</HI> and instead of <HI>Secundum,</HI> he says, <HI>Gradum Magistralem.</HI></P>
<P>Then one of the Masters makes a Valedictory Oration: and the President concludes the whole Solemnity with a Prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="010262_0092_0F7E48A5957FA980"/>The Proficiency made by the Students is various; according to their different Genius and Applica∣tion: a Number in each Class are generally finished Scholars in the Languages, and the liberal Arts and Sciences: and if they were dignified with some kind of peculiar Laurel, it might be an additional Stimu∣lus:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is also true, that some who have been educated and graduated here, have, by their Conduct, been no Honour to the Society: and since the Honour of every Degree, Title, or Office, will finally be to each Individual, according to the real Merit of the Ge∣nerality of those in the same Order; and every Instance of Honour, conferred upon an unworthy Subject, is eventually, at the Expence of those who are worthy; it is greatly to be desired, that more equal Justice should be done in that Respect.</NOTE> but their superior Qualifications are soon known to the World; and they, in a little Time, make a useful Figure in Church or State. Most of our superior Gentlemen, who have shined brightest at the Council Board, on the Bench, at the Bar, or in the Army, have had their Education in this Society. And some of them, of late Years have applied the Principles of Mechanical and Experimental Philoso∣phy, to the Improvement of Agriculture; and have been able to instruct their Neighbours in that Sci∣ence, for the publick Good.</P>
