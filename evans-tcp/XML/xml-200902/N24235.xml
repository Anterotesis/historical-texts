<L>GO patter to lubbers and swabs d'ye see,</L>
<L>'Bout danger, and fear and the like;</L>
<L>A tight water boat, and good sea-room give me,</L>
<L>And 't'ent to a little I'll strike;</L>
<L>Tho' the tempest top-gallant mast smack smooth should smite</L>
<L>And shiver each splinter of wood,</L>
<L>Clear the wreck, show the yards, and bouse every thing tight,</L>
<L>And under reef'd foresail we'll scud:</L>
<L>Avast ner do'nt think me a milk-sop so soft,</L>
<L>To be taken for trifles aback,</L>
<L>For they say there's a providence sits up aloft,</L>
<L>To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why I heard the good Chaplain palaver one day,</L>
<L>About souls, heaven, mercy and such;</L>
<L>And, my timbers, what lingo he'd coil and belay,</L>
<L>Why 'twas just all as one as high Dutch:</L>
<L>But he said how a sparrow can't founder d'ye see,</L>
<L>Without orders that come down below,</L>
<L>And many fine things that proved clearly to me,</L>
<L>That providence takes us in tow.</L>

For says he, do you mind me, let storms e'er so oft,</L>
<L>Take the top-sails of sailors aback,</L>
<L>There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,</L>
<L>To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I said to our Poll, for you see she would cry,</L>
<L>When last we weigh'd anchor for sea,</L>
<L>What argufies sniv'ling and piping your eye?</L>
<L>Why what a damn'd fool you must be:</L>
<L>Can't you see the world's wide and there's room for us all,</L>
<L>Both for seamen and lubbers ashore;</L>
<L>And if to old Davy I should go friend Poll,</L>
<L>Why you never will hear of me more;</L>
<L>What then, all's a hazard, come don't be so soft,</L>
<L>Perhaps I may laughing come back,</L>
<L>For d'ye see there's a cherub sits smiling aloft,</L>

<LG>
<L>D'ye mind me a sailor should be every inch,</L>
<L>All as one as a piece of his ship,</L>
<L>And with her brave the world, without offering to flinch,</L>
<L>From the moment the anchor's a trip:</L>
<L>As for me in all weathers, all times, sides, and ends,</L>
<L>Nought's a trouble which duty demands,</L>
<L>For my heart is my Poll's and my rhino my friend's,</L>
<L>And my life at my country's commands.</L>
<L>Even when my time comes ne'er believe me so soft,</L>
<L>As with grief to be taken aback,</L>
<L>The same little cherub that sits up aloft,</L>
<L>Will look out a good birth for poor Jack.</L>

Then he broke from my arms, and bid me farewell,</L>
<L>Saying, "Poll, come, my soul, it won't do;</L>
<L>"So do you hear, avast whining and sobbing my girl,</L>
<L>"'Tis all foolish nonsense in you.'</L>
<L>I could not help thinking that Jack was in right,</L>

<L>Yet while he's at distance each tho't is employ'd,</L>
<L>And nought can delight me on shore;</L>
<L>I fancy at times that the ship is destroy'd,</L>
<L>And Jack I shall never see more:</L>
<L>But that it's but fancy; that Angel above,</L>
<L>Who can do such a wonder of things,</L>
<L>I know will ne'er suffer a harm to my love,</L>
<L>And so to myself I thus sings;</L>
<L>What matters repining, my heart shall be light,</L>

<L>But should that sweet Angel, wherever he be,</L>
<L>Forget to look out after Jack;</L>
<L>Why then he may never return unto me,</L>
<L>Ah, never, no never come back:</L>
<L>But oh, it can't be, he's too good and too kind,</L>
<L>To make the salt water his grave;</L>
<L>And why should I then each tale-teller mind,</L>
<L>Or dread every turbulent wave:</L>
<L>Besides I will never kind Providence slight,</L>
<L>For a something there whispers d'ye see,</L>
<L>There's a sweet little Angel that sits out of sight,</L>
<L>Will restore my poor Jack unto me.</L>

<L>WHAT cheer my dear Poll—did'nt I tell you as how,</L>

<L>Now you plainly perceive that my words have come true,</L>
<L>So accept a salute from Poor Jack:</L>
<L>My heart's rigg'd with truth, and my honesty tight,</L>
<L>Not a strip of false colors I wear;</L>
<L>And the compass of love has directed me right,</L>
<L>To be blest with the charms of my fair:</L>
<L>So d'ye see that the chaplain may splice us in one,</L>
<L>Let me steer thee to Hymen's kind shore,</L>
<L>For Jack is resolv'd until that shall be done,</L>
<L>To depart from his Polly no more.</L>

<L>Do you think that I'll crowd canvass and drop you a-stern,</L>

<L>By the helm of fair constancy steer,</L>

<L>Start my planks, if you ever need fear:</L>
<L>'Cause why, d'ye mind, while that little sweet youth,</L>
<L>Sits smiling on watch up above,</L>
<L>Can the tempest of fate snap the cable of truth,</L>
<L>Or drag from the anchor of love:</L>

Should adversity board us, together we'll sink,</L>

<L>O my ship-mates, remember, our Chaplain would say,</L>

<L>There's a mighty Commander whom all must obey,</L>
<L>That will order good Christians aloft:</L>
<L>Then, avast my dear girl, swab the sights of your face,</L>
<L>Don't let sniv'ling your pleasure annoy;</L>
<L>O my timbers; I don't like such squalls to take place,</L>
<L>On the smooth bosom'd ocean of joy:</L>
<L>Bear a hand then, my love, with the current of bliss,</L>

<HEAD>THE DEATH OF POOR JACK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>POOR Jack, whose gay heart kept his spirits aloft,</L>
<L>And ever gave mirth its full due,</L>
<L>Who sadness despised, nor to grief was so soft,</L>
<L>Which made him the life of the crew:</L>
<L>Having weather'd the tempests of ocean and fate,</L>
<L>Disdaining all hardships and fear;</L>
<L>Hastened home to his Poll, with his true-hearted mate,</L>
<L>To be laid up in pleasure's snug tier.</L>
<L>With a good store of shiners his chest was supply'd,</L>
<L>Says he, "Now I'm on the right tack;</L>
<L>"For that cherub on whom I so often rely'd,</L>
<L>"Has home, safe and sound brought poor Jack."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To his heart Poll he pressed, the glad moment was fixt,</L>
<L>When tow'rds church he would take her in tow;</L>
<L>And there the good Chaplain should soon name the text,</L>
<L>That would splice 'em together, you know:</L>
<L>To his messmates, elated, he mention'd the morn,</L>
<L>And forecastle jokes went around;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="032039_0007_0FF0FDE140F1DDF8"/>
"As how that, they hop'd he'd not double Cape Horn,</L>
<L>"Or on jealousy's shoals run aground;</L>
<L>"But snug, at the helm, he'd all dangers defy,</L>
<L>"Laugh at those who'd his comforts attack,</L>
<L>"And the sweet little cherub aloft would espy</L>
<L>"Waving ensigns of joy o'er poor Jack."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That night which was nam'd by her sailor the last,</L>
<L>Poll should sleep in her hammock alone;</L>
<L>He resolv'd with his shipmates in glee should be past,</L>
<L>And mirth in his countenance shone:</L>
<L>He troll'd the blythe stave, drank a health to all round,</L>
<L>Good liquor had cherish'd his soul;</L>
<L>When a seaman a signal from beauty did sound,</L>
<L>Which call'd him away to his Poll:</L>
<L>"Avast, friend, adieu! for a moment we part,</L>
<L>"Poll commands me, about I must tack;</L>
<L>"For she's the sweet cherub that reigns in the heart,</L>
<L>"Of our friend and companion poor Jack."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But scarce from the cabbin of friendship he flew,</L>
<L>'Ere the sky formed a picture so dread;</L>
<L>The rain beat aloud; and the winds fiercely blew,</L>
<L>And thunder roll'd over his head:</L>
<L>For his messmates at sea, how his bosom did swell,</L>
<L>He sigh'd more than once for their fate;</L>
<L>Blue lightning flash'd around him, the kind victim fell,</L>
<L>His soul fled to death's calm retreat.</L>
<L>The cherub, who ever to virtue is near,</L>
<L>Bore it hence through a clear lucid track;</L>
<L>Yet gaz'd on his dust, and dropt a salt tear,</L>
<L>To deprive his sweet Poll of Poor Jack.</L>

<L>Away to a tender they told me to steer,</L>
<L>But of tenderness devil a morsel was there:</L>
<L>O I roar'd and I curst, tho' it did not avail,</L>
<L>They down in the cellar cram'd Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We set sail from Dublin the very next day,</L>
<L>I was half starved and sea-sick the rest of the way;</L>
<L>Not a mile-stone I saw, nor a house, nor a bed,</L>
<L>'Twas all water and sky 'till we came to Spithead:</L>
<L>Then they called up all hands—hands and feet soon obey'd,</L>
<L>O I wish'd myself home cutting turf with a spade,</L>
<L>For the first thing I faw made my courage to fail,</L>
<L>Ws a large floating castle for Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="032039_0014_0FF0FDEEDC09E6F8" MS="y"/>
<L>This huge wooden world roll'd about on the tide,</L>
<L>And a large row of teeth stuck fast in each side,</L>
<L>They put out the boat and told me to keep</L>
<L>Fast hold with my trotters for fear I should slip:</L>
<L>I let go with my hands to stick fast by my toes,</L>
<L>The ship gave a roll, and away my head goes,</L>
<L>I plung'd in the water and dash'd like a whale,</L>
<L>'Till with boat-hooks they fish'd up poor Patrick O'Neal,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Midst shouts jests and laughter they hoisted me in</L>
<L>To this huge wooden world full of riot and din;</L>
<L>Such ropes and such pullies, such sights met my eye,</L>
<L>And so large were the sheets that hung up to dry:</L>
<L>I thought it Noah's Ark stuff d full of queer guests,</L>
<L>Hogs, pedlers, geese, sailors, and all other beasts;</L>
<L>Some drank bladders of gin, others pitchers of ale,</L>
<L>And they sung, curst and laugh'd at poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All confounded with bother they began to look queer,</L>
<L>When the boatswain's shrill pipe made all hands to appear,</L>
<L>Up the ropes like to monkeys they running did swear</L>
<L>Then like gibbets and rope-dancers swung in the air,</L>
<L>They clap'd sticks in her capstern, (as I afterwards found)</L>
<L>The chap sit and fif'd as they turned it round,</L>
<L>The ship run her anchor, spread her wings and set fail,</L>
<L>with a freight of live lumber and Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to go down below I express'd a great wish,</L>
<L>Where they live under water like so many fish;</L>
<L>I was put in a mess with some more of the crew;</L>
<L>And it being banjon-day they gave me burgue;</L>
<L>For a bed they'd a sack hung as high as my chin,</L>
<L>They call'd it a hammock and bade me get in;</L>
<L>I lay hold, took a leap, but my footing being frail,</L>
<L>It swang me clean over!—poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With some help I got in, where I rocked all night,</L>
<L>The day broke my rest in a terrible fright,</L>
<L>Up hammocks, down chests, was cry'd from all parts</L>
<L>'There's a French ship in sight,' up and down went my heart:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="032039_0015_0FF0FDF1712CA750"/>
To a gun I was stationed, they cryed with an oath,</L>
<L>To pull off his breeches, unmuzzle his mouth,</L>
<L>They took off the apron that covered his tail,</L>
<L>And the leading-strings gave unto Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our thick window shutters we pulled up with speed</L>
<L>And we run out our bull dogs of true English breed,</L>
<L>The captain cried 'England and Ireland my boys!'</L>
<L>When he mentioned old Ireland my heart made a noise;</L>
<L>Our sweet little guns did the Frenchmen defy,</L>
<L>We clap'd fire on his back and bid him let fly,</L>
<L>His voice made me leap, tho' I'd hold by his tail,</L>
<L>The beast then flew back and threw Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then we leather'd away, by my soul, hob and nob,</L>
<L>'Till the Frenchmen gave up what they thought a bad job,</L>
<L>Then to tye him behind a long cord they did bring,</L>
<L>And we led him along like a pig in a string:</L>
<L>So home to old England we led the French boy,</L>
<L>O the sight of the land made me sea-sick with joy,</L>
<L>They made a new peace when the war was too stale,</L>
<L>And set all hands adrift and poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now safe on dry land a carousing I'll stear,</L>
<L>Nor cat-head, nor cat-block, nor boatswain's cat-fear;</L>
<L>While there's a shot in the locker I'll sing dance my round:</L>
<L>And Saturday night shall last all the year round:</L>
<L>But should peace grow too sleepy and war come again</L>
<L>Returning I'll bring you good folks, a fresh tale,</L>
<L>That you'll cry till you laugh at poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>

<HEAD>THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN my money was gone that I gain'd in the wars,</L>
<L>The world then did frown on my fate;</L>
<L>What matters my zeal or my honored scars,</L>
<L>When indifference stood at each gate:</L>
<L>The face that did smile when my purse was well lin'd,</L>
<L>Shew'd a different aspect on me;</L>
<L>And when I could nought but ingratitude find,</L>
<L>I hied me again to the sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I thought it unwise to repine at my lot</L>
<L>Or care how the world went on shore;</L>
<L>So I packed up the triffling remains I had got,</L>
<L>A trifflle alas was my store:</L>
<L>A handkerchief held all the little I had,</L>
<L>Which over my shoulder I threw;</L>
<L>Away then I trudged with a heart rather sad,</L>
<L>To join in some jolly ship's crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The seas were less troubled by far than my mind,</L>
<L>When o'er the wide main I survey'd;</L>
<L>I could not but think that the world was unkind,</L>
<L>And fortune a slippery jade:</L>
<L>I vow'd if once more I could get her in tow,</L>
<L>I would let the ungrateful ones see;</L>
<L>That the turbulent winds and the billows could show</L>
<L>More kindness than they did to me.</L>

<HEAD>THE BACCHANALIAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE heathenish Gods thought good liquor divine,</L>
<L>Ambrosia and Nectar were quaff'd off as wine:</L>
<L>Dad Jove was oft' muz—merry Momus a soul,</L>
<L>And big beily'd Bacchus stuck firm to his bowl:</L>
<L>The glass gingled round, the glad deities roared,</L>
<L>And gods keep it up, keep it up, was encor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The giants of old from the grape seiz'd their might,</L>
<L>Dapper fairies too sipp'd by the moon's silver light;</L>
<L>Their puny libations with rapture were swill'd,</L>
<L>And butter cup goblets with dew-drops were fill'd:</L>
<L>And thus fairy favors dispensing around,</L>
<L>The vales with their sonnets of pleasure resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old Terra's a drunkard, nice casuists maintain,</L>
<L>Opens her mouth for heaven's juice, gulph potations of rain;</L>
<L>Which if they're denied, her no produce will bring,</L>
<L>But russet appears the gay mantle of spring:</L>
<L>The oak's sturdy root, the smart shrub, herb, or flow'r,</L>
<L>E'en all vegetations refresh'd by the show'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then why should not we the full goblet display,</L>
<L>Let showers from a bumper still moisten our clay;</L>
<L>With love 'twill inspire us, to friendship give zest,</L>
<L>Raise our spirits, expand the proud heart in each breast:</L>
<L>Your glasses then sill, let no moment be lost,</L>

<L>Round went the can, the jest, the glee,</L>
<L>While tender wishes fill'd each fancy;</L>
<L>And when in turn it came to me,</L>
<L>I heav'd a sigh, and toasted Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next morn a storm came on at four</L>
<L>At six the elements in motion,</L>
<L>Plung'd me and three poor sailors more,</L>
<L>Headlong within the foaming ocean.</L>
<L>Poor wretches they soon found their grave,</L>
<L>For me it may be only fancy;</L>
<L>But love seemed to forbid the wave,</L>
<L>To snatch me from the arms of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce the foul hurricane had clear'd,</L>
<L>Scarce winds and waves had ceas'd to rattle.</L>
<L>When a bold enemy appear'd,</L>
<L>And dauntless we prepar'd for battle;</L>
<L>And now while some lov'd friend or wife,</L>
<L>Like light'ning rush'd on ev'ry fancy;</L>
<L>To Providence I trusted life,</L>
<L>Put up a prayer and thought on Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last 'twas in the month of May,</L>
<L>The crew, it being lovely weather;</L>
<L>At three A. M. discover'd day,</L>
<L>And England's chalky cliffs together,</L>
<L>At seven up channel how we bore,</L>
<L>While hopes and fears rush'd on my fancy,</L>
<L>At twelve I gayly jump'd on shore,</L>
<L>And to my throbbing heart press'd Nancy.</L>
