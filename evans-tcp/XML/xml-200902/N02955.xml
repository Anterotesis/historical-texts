<HEAD>ADVICE and CAUTION FROM Our Monthly Meeting AT PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>Held the 25th Day of the <HI>Sixth Month,</HI> 1732, <HI>Concerning Children and Servants.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an obvious and known Truth, that next to the Vigilance we ought to have over our own Con∣duct, so as to stand accepted in the Sight of God, and to behave inoffensively and exemplarily towards Men, is the comely and necessary Care for Posterity, and over our Chil∣dren.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003544_0002_0FF85CBCE422A410"/>
THIS Care is highly prudent, and an incumbent Duty, in Families, in Schools, and in Societies; for in general it may be said and expected, That the Morals and Principles which are first imprinted will be of Duration, and if good, of great Advantage, since in the Course of Pro∣vidence, the Children of this Age are to be the People of the next.</P>
<P>REMARKABLE and grievous is the Depravity of Manners so ob∣servable in our Streets; sorrowful enough is it to see the great Encrease of Pro∣phaneness and Lewdness, too generally among the People of late Years, much owing to the Importation of great Num∣bers of the vicious and scandalous Refuse of other Countries. But it is yet more to be lamented by every honest Mind who wish well, and would contribute all in their Power to the Reputation, Sobriety, and future Happiness of the Province, and are truely concerned for the Honour of God, and true Religion, to observe the rude Behaviour and vile Language, used and propogated among the Chil∣dren almost as soon as they can speak.</P>
<P>AS this is become so publick and
<PB N="3" REF="003544_0003_0FF85CBE695C64E8"/>
conspicuous an Evil, it is to be hoped, and earnestly desired, that the well-minded and sober Inhabitants of all Per∣suasions, may use all Diligence, and think of proper Means to redress it, for the more general the Purpose and Endeavours are, the more easily will the good End be obtained.</P>
<P>A Concern having been for some Time on the Minds of several Friends, on this Occasion, this Meeting finds it highly necessary, to make some Essay towards a Reformation of the Evil. And considering, that it chiefly, and almost entirely will lie upon the Heads of Families, Parents and Tutors, we recommend the Case generally to them, and earnestly press and entreat, that they will enter more deeply and closely into the Thoughts of their Duty, and at proper Times of Retirement, humbly and earnestly implore the Divine Assi∣stance, and then diligently and constantly pursue what they find to be such, with∣out Weariness or Discouragement at the Difficulties or Disappointments they may meet with: And although much must be left to the Vigilance and Care of 
<PB N="4" REF="003544_0004_0FF85CC1531C0F30"/>
those, as Occasion may call and excite them, yet on the Part of our Community, we for the present recommend and advise some Methods, which we hope may contribute towards the desired Effect, and prevent much of the Disorder among our own.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st,</HI> That Parents do not suffer an indiscreet and partial (and as it may prove ruinous) Fondness, to misguide their Judgments, by hearkening to, and taking Part with their Children, against the due Correction which their School-Masters or School-Mistresses may use, or the Reproofs and Complaints of them, or other Friends, for their vicious or evil Behaviour, but, that Parents hear with Temper and Moderation, and where there appears just Cause, joyn their Authority for the Reproof or Correction of their Children, avoiding to vindicate or support them with Re∣sentment; but if they should find any Degree of Vindication or Excuse to be just, that they do it with Calmness and Prudence, and (unless the contrary be really necessary) out of the Hearing of their Children.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="003544_0005_0FF85CC536EA9418"/>
<HI>2d,</HI> That Children be kept punctually to the Hours of School, and that at breaking up, they go directly to their respective Homes: It is desired, that both Parents, School-Masters and School-Mistresses joyn their Authority and strict Care in this Respect, which may prevent in good Measure, their falling into bad Company, and evil Con∣versation.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3d,</HI> That Parents be very cautious and watchful in the Liberties they give their Children, for Play or Recreation, limitting and obliging them as much as possible, to Punctuality, as to Time, Place and Company; accustoming them in an easy free Manner, to render true Accounts thereof; which they will be brought to do, and to receive Advice and Direction, if managed mildly, and in Love, without Brow-beating, or striking Terror; unless it be on extraordinary and proper Occa∣sions.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4th,</HI> That School-Masters and School-Mistresses do seriously consider the Cal∣ling they undertake, which consists as much in the well forming the Morals of their Pupils, inculcating Obedience 
<PB N="6" REF="003544_0006_0FF85CC6DD91C360"/>
to their Parents and Superiours, and generally a decent &amp; becoming Behaviour, as in a just Care to forward and improve them in the Literature they profess to teach: Also, that they cause the Chil∣dren under their Care, to come to Meet∣ings, and there attend with them, order∣ing them at all Times, when there is Room, to sit together conveniently, so as they may observe their Behaviour, taking proper Times in their Schools, to commend and encourage such as behave soberly and orderly, and to reprimand and admonish those who be∣have otherwise.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5th,</HI> The great Error of giving Cor∣rection rather from their own Passion, than the Import or Consequence of the Fault, should be carefully avoided both by Parents and Tutors: Few Things, very few in some Children, require bodily Correction; <HI>willful</HI> and <HI>habitual Lying,</HI> and <HI>obstinate Disobedience,</HI> seem to be the main Faults to which that should be apply'd; to inculcate a Sense of <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Disrepute</HI> on the one hand, and a <HI>laudable Emulation</HI> on the other, is a beneficial Art in the Instructor.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="7" REF="003544_0007_0FF85CC99FFE1BF8"/>
<HI>6th,</HI> And whereas it is apparent, that much of the Disorder complained of, is owing to the great Neglect in well∣governing and restraining of Apprentices and Servants, as well as Children; and probably more so, by the unreasonable Liberties they take, and the ill Example they shew to Children: It is therefore desired and urgently press'd, that such of our Friends as are Masters and Mistresses, do also consider well their Duty in that Station, especially towards Apprentices, over whom they, in a manner, stand in the Place of Parents during their Contract; and both by Example and Precept, earnestly endea∣vour to conduct them right in a Sense of Religion, and a sober and orderly Behaviour, which, it may be hoped, will make durable Impressions on them, highly beneficial in their grown State, and cause them to remember you, and the Time of their Service with Pleasure and Gratitude.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Apprentices</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> therefore, as well as <HI>Children</HI> be encouraged to go to Meetings, especially on <HI>First Days,</HI> 
<PB N="8" REF="003544_0008_0FF85CCC369DDB78"/>
and there to sit soberly and orderly, and stay the Time; for its observed with Grief, the Liberty taken by those to ramble and stroll about Streets, and the adjacent Parts of the Town, or gather into Companies at idle or rude Sports or Games, on the first Days of the Week, and at other Times when they are not held to Labour or Business, to the great Reproach of the Place, and highly scandalous to Sobriety and good order; and as the Magistrates of the City have sometimes used Means to prevent those and the like Disorders, with a De∣gree of Success; the resolute Continu∣ance of their Endeavours is hoped, and it is earnestly desired of all our Friends who are concerned therein, as Magi∣strates, Constables, or otherwise, that they contribute all in their Power, in their respective Stations, to a Reforma∣tion so necessary and laudable; which will make the Care and Endeavours of the Heads of Families much more easy and effectual.</P>
