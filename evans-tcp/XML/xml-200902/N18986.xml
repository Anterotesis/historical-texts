<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY Man who commits his Sen∣timents to public Criticism, whe∣ther his Motive be Honor, Interest, or other Consideration, will be supposed to hope for Public Patronage, or Ap∣plause. But the Man who shall ser∣vily condescend to obtain Success; who shall by debasing himself, attempt to elevate or exalt another, deserves not private Regard or Public Favor.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Sheets, is strongly impressed with these Senti∣ments, and Altho' he feels as all Au∣thors must do, who commit themselves
<PB N="iv" REF="024705_0003_0FC82CF7C4262A10"/>to the World: Altho' he knows many great and respectable Men, whose Friendship would please him, and whose Patronage would do him Honor; he prefers to obtain their As∣sentation to his Labors, as the volun∣tary Essusions of their own Hearts, than as the Tribute to his Flattery or Solicitation. Thus thinking, none will blame, thus acting, all will applaud, who are admirers of the native Inde∣pendancy, which is the Birth-right of Man.—</P>
<P>Inaccuracies will, in this Work, probably obtain, but let the Rea∣der reflect, that it is the genuine Offspring of positive Observation, taken sometimes on Horseback, some∣times on a Stump, but always in Haste, amidst the <HI>Hurly Burly</HI> of un∣informed and generally Indian Com∣panions.</P>

<HEAD>A TOUR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the first Day of <HI>June,</HI> 1790, I took my Departure from the City of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI> with an Intention of visiting the Wes∣tern Regions of <HI>Kentuckey,</HI> and exploring the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions of <HI>Louisiana</HI> and the two <HI>Floridas;</HI> as also the Territories of the <HI>Creek</HI> Nation, now under the Governance of <HI>Alex∣ander M'Gillivray,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who from the con∣current Approbation which he hath merited and received from the whole Nation, may, with Propriety, be said to hold imperial Pow∣er, having many Kings and Princes subordi∣nate to him.</P>
<P>How far I have succeeded in the Explora∣tion of those Countries, the Reader will de∣termine from a candid Perusal of my Jour∣nal.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 10th. Contractcd a violent Rheu∣matism from wetting my Feet, in an Attempt to cross the <HI>Rapedan,</HI> which retarded my Pro∣gress
<PB N="6" REF="024705_0005_0FC82CFA8EE98140"/>for about eight Weeks in the County of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; where the Humanity and Politeness of Col. <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> and his Lady mitigated my Distress, and ultimately restored me to my pristine Health and Vigour. This Gentle∣man, as well as his Brother <HI>William,</HI> possesses a rare mechanical Genius, and to which he hath superadded a practical Knowledge in Me∣dicine and Surgery; the Advantages of which, his poor Neighbours often experience with Tears of Gratitude.</P>
<P>Some Years since, the Assembly of Virgi∣nia voted a Premium to Mr. <HI>John Hobdy,</HI> for his Invention of a Machine, which he sub∣mitted to their Inspection, well calculated for the Purposes of beating out Wheat and other small Grain. Col. <HI>William</HI> hath improved upon <HI>Hobdy</HI>'s Invention by constructing a Wa∣ter-Mill, which without the Aid of animal Exertion, shatters out and prepares more small Grain of any Kind in one Day, than <HI>Hobdy</HI>'s can in one Week. With this Mill alone, he speedily prepares his Flax and Hemp for Mar∣ket or the Distaff. It is a Model well worth the Attention of every opulent Farmer, or of those who raise large Crops of Flax and Hemp.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024705_0006_0FC82CFE9552FFE8"/><HI>August</HI> 10. Crossed the <HI>Blue-Ridge</HI> and halted for three Days at <HI>New-Town,</HI> within about eight Miles of <HI>Winchester.</HI> This flourishing little Town I think, bids fair to eclipse <HI>Winchester</HI> in a few Years, or, be con∣nected with her by a lengthy Village: Its Lo∣cality gives it a decided Preference to <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> as being in a fertile Neighborhood, and nearer to Mills, Iron-Works and the fu∣ture Navigation of the <HI>Shenandeah.</HI></P>
<P>From this Place I made some few Excur∣sions into the Country, particularly to the Houses of Colonels <HI>Zane</HI> and <HI>Thruston;</HI> the former of whom possesses a greater Originali∣ty of Thought, Speech and Action, than any other Gentleman I ever was acquainted with.</P>
<Q><L>O'er many Waters, he hath been,</L>
<L>And Knowledge great acquir'd,</L>
<L>From reading Books as well as Men,</L>
<L>For shining Parts admir'd:</L>
<L>From ev'ry great Metropolis,</L>
<L>I Ie some Instruction draws,</L>
<L>By ascertaining its Police</L>
<L>Of Manners, Customs, Laws.</L></Q>
<P>He is the Proprietor of the Iron-Works, which, under his judicious Management yield an amazing Profit. All the Works which are very complex, are driven by the Water is∣suing
<PB N="8" REF="024705_0007_0FC82D03836120A8"/>from one Spring, whose Source is not above a Quarter of a Mile from the pot.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 14th. Found myself happy in the Family of the sensible, humane and generous Col. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. M. Thruston,</HI> whose public and pri∣vate Characters will bear the strictest Scrutiny. His late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>isplay of unparralled Generosity to a distressed, though reputable Family, will be enrolled in the Court above; and from the rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Angel, instead of a Tear, extort an approbative Smile. This Gentleman at an early Period of the War, laying aside his sa∣cerdotal Habit, appeared at the Head of a Re∣giment in Defence of his injured Country. His Achievements in the Field, his Wisdom in Council, and the general Tenour of his Conduct, through the various Scenes of Life, do him Honour, and claim from a grateful Country its warmest Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>On this Gentleman's Farm I observed about an Acre of Ground well beset with <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Artichokes, of a most luxuriant Growth; the Colonel told me that he was confident the Pro∣duction would exceed one Thousand Bushels. To this Vegetable, Swine and horned Cattle of every Description, particularly Sheep, are surprisingly attached—I do not discover it to 
<PB N="9" REF="024705_0008_0FC82D04546BCC68"/>be any Way inferiour to the Garden Artichoke for Table Use.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 17th. Arrived in <HI>Winchester</HI> much relaxed from the Heat of the Weather, and whilst lolling on a Couch, was saluted by a Mr. <HI>John Welch,</HI> who had served in my Regi∣ment in the Capacity of a common Soldier du∣ring the last War. With great self-Compla∣cency he informed me, that since the War he had been prosperous in Life, had acquired a snug little Retreat in the Country, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a large Drove of Cattle within four Miles of the Place, which he meant to dispose of to the <HI>French</HI> emigrants then stationary in Win∣chester — that he wished to go back, meet the Drove and hurry them into Town, least others might supplant him in the Sale; but that he had sent his Horse to the same Pasture where his Cattle were, so that he should be under the Necessity of going on Foot. unless he could beg, borrow, or steal a Nag to ride that small Distance: Mr. <HI>Welch,</HI> I am happy to hear of your Prosperity, and you are entirely welcome to the Use of my Horse to ride that Distance— Sir, you are very good, and I'll embrace your generous Offer, and on my Return this Even∣ing give myself the Pleasure of Dining with you. I fear some Accident has happened to Mr. <HI>Welch,</HI> as I have neither seen him, the
<PB N="10" REF="024705_0009_0FC82D072F153518"/>Horse, Bridle or Saddle from that Hour to this! In this situation, on a Journey with 180 Miles in Rear, and 500 in Front, I be∣gan like <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap</HI> to moralize, with only this Difference, he said "A Fool and his Money is soon parted;" I used the Word Horse in∣stead of Money.</P>
<P>During my Continuance in <HI>Winchester,</HI> I was frequently in the Company of General <HI>Morgan,</HI> whose Character as a Military Man, is held in high Estimation even by his Ene∣mies— Possessed of an easy Fortune, he now enjoys all the Sweets of Domestication, and the Heart felt Pleasure arising from a conscious Rectitude. He is fond of the social Pleasures, and will sometimes in his gayer Moments, amuse the Company with Narratives of mar∣tial Feats, and how Somebody, and who it was, that plucked the Laurels from fierce Tarlton's Brow.</P>
<P><HI>September.</HI> Hearing that the <HI>Monongali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Ohio</HI> were innavigable, I resolved to spend my Time until they should rise among my Friends in <HI>Berkeley</HI> County, which for its Temperature of Air, Salubrity of Baths and Fertility of Soil, justly claims the Preference of every other County in <HI>Virginia,</HI> but less so of <HI>Frederick</HI> than the rest, whether for the
<PB N="11" REF="024705_0010_0FC82D09EEF24F80"/>Properties already mentioned or the Hospita∣lity and safe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of its People in general.</P>
<P>I paid a Visit to Mr. <HI>Clarks Washington,</HI> the Brother of our beloved President, where I had the Pleasure of seeing a most affectionate Meeting between him and his Sister, attended with several Female Relations from <HI>Frede∣ricks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury.</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Rutherford,</HI> a Mem∣ber of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Senate was also there, and contributed much to the Chearfulness of the Company, by singing several most excellent and sentimental songs. I am indebted to this Gentleman and Mr. <HI>Washington</HI> for furnish∣ing me with a joint Letter of Introduction, to some of the most reputable Characters in <HI>Kentuckey:</HI> Messrs. <HI>David Gray</HI> and <HI>Moses Hunter</HI> are among the number of these who have imposed Obligations on me.</P>
<P><HI>October.</HI> Pursued my Route through <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s Town and <HI>Martinsburg,</HI> two flou∣rishing little Towns. At the former I saw General <HI>Gates</HI> and his Family on their Way to <HI>New-York,</HI> and at the latter, General <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> who observed that the Triamvirate was now entirely dissolved, alluding to Generals <HI>Lee, Gates</HI> and himself;</P>

<P>Began to ascend the <HI>Alleghany</HI> Mountains in Company with old Col. <HI>Shepherd,</HI> who observed, that for many Years he had made it an invariable Rule to take a hearty Drink of Grog at a Spring near the Road-ide, where the Eastern and Western Waters very amicably take their Leave of each other, in∣timating that we and our Western Brethren ought to do so likewise. I shall not under∣take a Description of a Sixty Miles Passage over those <HI>Alpine</HI> Hills, but content myself with saying, that I passed through the Sha∣dow of Death—saw General <HI>Washington</HI>'s In∣trenchment at the Meadows, and undismayed, rode over <HI>Braddock</HI>'s Grave. From the Western Side of <HI>Laurel</HI> Hill, on a pleasant Eveaning, I was ravish'd with the Prospect of Beeson Town and the circumjacent Coun∣try. Ten Miles from Beeson Town lies the Old Fort, at the Junction of a smail Stream, called <HI>Redstone</HI> and the <HI>Monongalia.</HI> At this Place we were detained about a Week, experiencing every Disgust which Rooks and Harpies could excite.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024705_0012_0FC82D0E51A3FDC0"/><HI>October.</HI> Wenton Board a <HI>Kentuckey</HI> Roat in Company with three <HI>Danville</HI> Merchants, and a Mr, <HI>Fooley</HI> from the State of <HI>Mary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na,</HI> and in Twenty-three Hours r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ched <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣burg.</HI> The last mentioned Gentlemen from his Singularities and Fooleries merits a mi∣nute Description, which, however, I am at a Loss to give. Suffice it to say, that Mr. <HI>Thomas Fooley,</HI> of a very reputable Family in <HI>Maryland,</HI> is about six Feet three Inches high, and every Way disproportionate in his Shape and contradictrory in the Lineaments of his Face, which at first View excited a Refi∣bility in the most serious Beholder. The De∣formities of his Conduct vie with those of his Person. It was sometime last Month that Mr. <HI>Fooley</HI> eloped from his Lady, under an Apprehension that she was preparing through the Medium of her Friends an Instrument of Writing for him to sign, whereby a consider∣able Part of his Fortune was to be vested in the Hands of Trustees, subject to her Con∣troul. To this Mr. <HI>Fooley</HI> was utterly op∣posed—However, previous to his Elopement he left her an unlimited Power of Attorney, which he delivered into the Hands of his Overteer. At <HI>Redstone</HI> he disposed of his ele∣gant Horse and Furniture for an old Brass Watch, which has the Property of being
<PB N="14" REF="024705_0013_0FC82D0F9B948048"/>right once in every Twelve Hours: Not∣withstanding thi, Mr. <HI>Fooley</HI> is a Gentleman of Refinement, being both a Philosopher and Politician, with some Knowledge of Astro∣logy and Palmistry.</P>
<P><HI>October.</HI> Apprehending a Return of the Rheumatism, I resolved to awart the Event in <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> where I could be comfortably lodged and duly attended; I staid ten Days Here I saw the celebrated <HI>Hugh Henry Breck∣enridge,</HI> Author of the six political Sermons in the beginning of the War, and of various other Traits since—He had been lately mar∣ried to a Miss <HI>Sabina Wolfe,</HI> Daughter of an old <HI>Dutch</HI> Farmer in <HI>Washington</HI> County— The Circumstances of his Courtship, Mar∣riage and subsequent Conduct I shall relate, with some slight References to the Person, Temper and Disposition of the Man.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Breckenridge</HI> on his Way from <HI>Wash∣ington</HI> Court. called in at Mr. <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s to have his Horse fed and escape a Rain which was then descending. The Horse was fed, the Rain had subsided, and Mr. <HI>Breckenridge</HI> to avoid wet Feet, ordered his Horse to be brought to the Door; Miss <HI>Wolfe</HI> was di∣rected to perform that Office.</P>
<Q><PB N="15" REF="024705_0014_0FC82D11D64C1970"/>
<L>Nut brown were her Locks, her Shape was full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>Her Eyes were as black as a Sloe;</L>
<L>Milk while were her Teeth, full smart was her G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it,</L>
<L>And sleek was her Skin as a Doe.</L></Q>
<P>These Allurements made a deep Impres∣sion upon the susceptible Heart of <HI>Brecken∣ridge</HI>—He prevented her in the servile Office, mounted his Nag and off he went. He had not gone more than a Sabbath Day's Jour∣ney, (for such his really was) before his Horse, at the Instigation of the Rider, turned short about and revisited Mr. <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s. A fa∣miliar Application was made to the old Gen∣tleman for his Daughter, which he consi∣dered as nothing more than Pleasantry in Mr. <HI>Breckenridge,</HI> for which he is so remarkable. Mr. <HI>Breckenridge</HI> declared that he was seri∣ous, that his Intentions were honourable, and that this future Happiness rested on the Event of his then Application. Miss <HI>Sabina</HI> had been employed in Shrubbing the old Man's Meadow, which saved him the annual Ex∣pence of about ten Dollars. This with him was an insuperable Objection to parting with his Girl—Mr. <HI>Breckenridge</HI> obviated the Dif∣ficulty by paying down a Sum of Money, obtained the Young Lady's Consent, married her, and sent her to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where she now is under the Governance of a reputable
<PB N="16" REF="024705_0015_0FC82D13B98163C8"/>female Character, whose Business will be to polish the Manners, and wipe off the Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti∣cities which Mrs. <HI>Breckenridge</HI> had acquired whilst a <HI>Wolfe.</HI></P>
<P>As an Introduction to an Acquaintance with this Gentleman, I composed, inclosed and sent to him on the Evening of my Arri∣val, the following hasty Production, which without my Knowledge or Consent, he had inserted in the <HI>Pittsburg</HI> Gazette.</P>

<P>In Company with this Gentleman I view∣ed the Fort and neighbouring Eminencies of <HI>Pittsburg,</HI> which will one Day or other em∣ploy the historic Pen, as being replete with strange and melancholy Events. The town at present, is inhabited with only some few Exceptions, by Mortals who act as if pos∣sessed of a Charter or Exclusive Privilege to filch from, annoy and harrass her Fellow Creatures, particularly the incautious and necessitous; many who have emigrated from various Parts, to <HI>Kentuckey</HI> can verify this Charge—Goods of every Description are dearer in <HI>Pittsburg</HI> than in <HI>Kentuckey,</HI> which I attribute to a Combination of pensioned Scoundrels who insest the Place.

Nothing materially occurred—We had a tolerable Passage of five Days and Nights down to <HI>Limestone,</HI> a little Town, situate on the Banks of the <HI>Ohio,</HI> at the Mouth of <HI>Limestone</HI> Creek, where Emi∣grants from <HI>Virginia</HI> and all the Eastern States most commonly debark. Leaving this Place, I passed on in a direct Route through the most fertile Parts of <HI>Kentuckey,</HI> by <HI>Wash∣ington, Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Lexington</HI> Townships to <HI>Danville,</HI> the present Metropolis of the Dis∣trict. In this Place and its Vicinage I con∣tinued about a Month, experiencing every Civility and Hospitality which so remarkably
<PB N="19" REF="024705_0018_0FC82D1B86191C88"/>characterize the People. The Topography of <HI>Kentuckey</HI> is foreign to my Purpose, as Mr. <HI>Filson</HI> and others have treated that Sub∣ject with great Candour and Precission. Mere Occurrencies, and the most conspicuous Traits of Men and Manners, are the principal Objects of my Investigation. General <HI>Wil∣linson</HI> and <HI>Scott</HI> are too generally known both at Home and abroad, to require any Eulogi∣um from me: I shall, therefore, wishing them every Prosperity, proceed on to <HI>Louisville</HI> and its Neighbourhood, and rouse up Gen. <HI>George Rogers Clarke,</HI> who, the <HI>Kentuckians</HI> say, hath actually been in a profound Slumber for upwards of four Years, without the least Symptoms of Wakefulness whatever.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 15th. Arrived at his House un∣der an Apprehension that he had forgotten me. He immediately recognized me, and without Ceremony, entered into a familiar. though desultory Conversation, in which I was highly pleased with the Atticism of his Wit, the genuine Offspring of native Genius. On serious and important Occasions he dis∣plays a Profundity of Judgment, aided by Reflection and matured by Experience. I cannot dismiss this Gentleman without ob∣serving that some few Years since he shone forth in all the Glory of military Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess.
<PB N="20" REF="024705_0019_0FC82D1E1EFC1160"/>He appeared from his Plans and Successes to have possessed an intuitive Knowledge of the Manoeuvres and Designs of the Enemy, hav∣ing in no Instance out of many concerted his Operations injudiciously.</P>
<P>At <HI>Louisville</HI> the first Object that caught my Attention was the ludicrous Mr. <HI>Fooley</HI>— Having exhausted all his Cash, he had ex∣changed his fine long tail'd broad Cloth Coat for a Sailor's coarse Jerkin, which reached within four Inches of the Waistband's of his red Plush Breeches— He had swapped his Beaver for a coarse high crown'd narrow brimm'd Wool Hat, which he thought ex∣pedient, though contrary to all Precedent, to throw into a smart triangular Cock; by the last Exchange he gained a round Half Dollar Piece. In this Garb, our Hero fraught with consummate Impudence, set out in Quest of Adventures. As he had been a Fellow Tra∣veller in a strange Land, I could not help re∣monstrating with him upon the Impropriety of his Conduct, which, however he endea∣voured to defend, by observing that his then Appearance was in Honour to the Memories of Mr. <HI>Sterne</HI> and Lord <HI>Verulam.</HI>—For Sir, added he, Mr. <HI>Sterne</HI> hath written expressly on the Subject of Jerkins in these Words, "A Man's Body and his Mird, with reverence I speak
<PB N="21" REF="024705_0020_0FC82D200E0ABDE8"/>it, are exactly like a Jerkin and a Jerkin's Lining—Rumple the one, you Rumple the other:" And as to my Lord <HI>Verulam, "Smell-fungus</HI> in his History of <HI>England</HI> represents his Lordship's Chappo, as similar to what now covers the Noddle of your humble Ser∣vant."</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of <HI>Louisville</HI> I con∣tinued upwards of two Months; those with whom I associated, were affable and humane: The Stranger here may consider himself as at Home—for such is the extreme Hospitality of the People, that unknown to their Guest, they will confer, or rather impose Acts of Be∣neficence, which cannot be refused without Rudeness.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 4th. 1791. Proceeded down the <HI>Ohio</HI> in Company with a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who was taking his <HI>American</HI> Wife and Children along with him to <HI>Langue la Graisse,</HI> or, the <HI>Greasy Bent;</HI> now called by the <HI>Spaniards Neuvo Madrid,</HI> on the Western Side of the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> The Governor of <HI>Pensacola</HI> says, that the Etymology of <HI>Langue la Graisse</HI> ori∣ginates from the Rivers forming an extensive Curve; where, upon the first Settlement of the Place, great Quantities of Bear-Meat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stored up for the Use of the Garrison and
<PB N="22" REF="024705_0021_0FC82D26B44B2D30"/>the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Navigators up and down the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> which Meat is of a very oleose Quality; though in my Opinion, the Greasiness of the Soil, with the Devexity of the River, sufficiently justify the Epithet.</P>
<P>During our Passage from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to this Place, we were frequently alarmed at the hos∣tile Appearance of Indians on both Sides of the <HI>Ohio</HI> and <HI>Missisippi;</HI> suspecting our Num∣bers to be superiour to their own, they were deterred from coming against us in Force; which had they done, we should have fallen Victims without a Possibility of Escape to their merciless Barbarity.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 12th. 1791. Breakfasted and dined with <HI>Signior Pedro Foucher,</HI> Commandant at <HI>Neuvo Madrid.</HI> The Garrison consist of about Ninety Men, who are well supplied with Food and Raiment; they have an excellent Train of Artillery, which appears to be their chief Defence—Two Regular Companies of Musqueteers with charged Bayo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets might take this Place. Of this Opinion is the Com∣mandant himself, who complains that he is not sufficiently supported—He is a <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, of <HI>Patagonian</HI> Size, po∣lite in his Manners, and of a most noble Presence. On the Evening of this Day em∣barked
<PB N="23" REF="024705_0022_0FC82D2793BA00C8"/>in a Boat called the Smoke-House, bound to <HI>New Orleans,</HI> and anchored on the <HI>Georgian</HI> Shore, about Thirty Miles below <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13th. Setting at the Vessel's Head I es∣pied about a Dozen Fowls as large as <HI>Musco∣vile</HI> Ducks, of a blai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h grey Colour, with remarkable short Necks, the Name of which no one on Board knew, as never having seen any of the Kind before, though they had long been accustomed to the Navigation of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and visited most Parts of the habitable Globe. An <HI>Hibernian</HI> on Board swore that from the shortness of their Necks they were either <HI>Cygnets</HI> or young <HI>Cranes;</HI> for that the old Ones liad Necks ten Times as long.</P>
<P N="14">14th. The Trecs on the Margin of the River in Verdue. At 9 o'Clock encounted a Congeries of Aiots and passed the first <HI>Chickasaw</HI> Bluff, where the River is about Five Hundred Yards wide—At 12 o'Clock we lost Sight of <HI>Mans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur</HI>'s Boat in a strong Gale of Wind—8 o'Clock at Night one of Mr.<HI>Craig</HI>'s Tobacco Boats, with Forty Hogs∣heads of Tobacco, and a large Quantity of Flour and Plank passed us whilst we lay in Harbour, she had lost her Rudder and sprung
<PB N="24" REF="024705_0023_0FC82D2A4994ED38"/>a Leak. In this Situation, with only three Hands on Board, they implored our Aid, which through prudential Motives was de∣nied.</P>
<P N="15">15th. At Sunrise espied the <HI>Frenchman</HI>'s Boat in good Harbour and uninjured; but different was the Fate of Mr. <HI>Craigs,</HI> which had sprung a Leak in her Bow and appeared to be stranded opposite to the second <HI>Chick∣asaw</HI> Bluff, where the River is about Four Hundred Yards wide. At 9 o'Clock we viewed the third <HI>Chickesaw</HI> Bluff, opposite to the <HI>Bayone St. John,</HI> where the River is not quite Four Hundred Yards wide. The Colours of this Bluff are white, red, yellow, blue, grey, black, brown, purple, &amp;c. Here the <HI>Chickasaws</HI> once had a small Pottery— Upon this Bluff is the most eligible Situation for a Town which I have as yet seen on the Banks of the <HI>Missisippi.</HI>—Just under this Bluff, within six Feet of the Shore, a first Rate Man of War might ride in Safety, un∣assailed by Winds, &amp;c. At the upper End of this Bluff is an old Blockhouse, built by a Captain <HI>Besheare</HI>'s Company, who had the Convoy of military Stores for the <HI>Chickasaws,</HI> which they deposited therein, until they could procure the Assistance of additional and fresh Hands. From the lower End of this
<PB N="25" REF="024705_0024_0FC82D2B59E67670"/>Bluff, the River suddenly opens to the ama∣zing width of four, five and sixth Miles. Upon Examination, I find our Crew consist of one <HI>Irishman,</HI> one <HI>Anspacher,</HI> one <HI>Kentuc∣kean,</HI> one Person born on <HI>Sea,</HI> one <HI>Virginian,</HI> and one <HI>Welchman;</HI> six Total. At 12 o'Clock came on a violent Storm, which with Difficulty we evited, by exerting every Nerve to gain the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 17th. 1791. The <HI>Irishman</HI> in Ho∣nour of St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> purloined all our Bran∣dy, Sugar and Eggs to make a Tub of Egg-Nog, of which he drank so copiously, that whilst at the Helm, he insensibly run the Vessel into a strong Eddy, to get her out of which, employed all Hands in hard Labour the Balance of the Day.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18th. At Sunrise came on a slight Snow, which formed a curious Contrast to the Verdure of the Trees—All the Afternoon of this Day we run due North.</P>
<P N="19">19th. At 8 o'Clock we run due South— All this Day the Weather was intensely cold, the Wind blowing from North. About Noon six <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Chactaw</HI> Nation came on Board and presented us with two Strings of jerked Venison, for which we in Return gave
<PB N="26" REF="024705_0025_0FC82D2DDD962478"/>them six Pound of Bacon and a Peck of Salt, which they pronounced to be very good. At 1 o'Clock we were hailed by a <HI>Pennsylvanian</HI> and a Lad in a <HI>Peroch,</HI> laden with Bear and Buffaloc Meat, taken on the St. <HI>Francis</HI> Ri∣ver, and bound up the <HI>Os<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rque</HI> River, where there is a Settlement of Thirty Families about Thirty Miles from its Mouth. At 3 o'Clock overtaken by two Boats laden with Flour and Tobacco.</P>
<P N="20">20th. At Sunrise drew up a Kitten of about Twenty lbs. Weight, which with the Help of God and an <HI>Irish</HI> Cook, we made into most excellent Broth. At 9 o'Clock came up with two large <HI>Pittsburg</HI> Boats at Anchor laden with Flour, on the Shore, opposite to which, was a Conceurs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Osarque Indians.</HI> An old Man among them was in Mourning, having his Face blacken'd over with a Com∣mixture of Bear's Oil, Charcoal and Turpen∣tine: Just under his Jowls were two Streaks of red and white, which ran parallel to each other—The <HI>Indian</HI> Ladies very innocently displayed their Navels, and the curious Dye might have explored other Parts which civi∣lized Nations industriously conceal. Twenty Miles up the <HI>Osarque</HI> River are their Wig∣wams, opposite to which, on the Eastern Side, is a <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison of Twenty-nine Men—
<PB N="27" REF="024705_0026_0FC82D3049D59FB8"/>The Place is high, well watered, and as yet the Garrison have experienced no Sickness.</P>
<P N="21">21st. At 8 o'Clock descried a Keel bot∣tom'd Boat with a square Sail, bound to <HI>New Madrid</HI>—Her Progress under a fair Wind was at the Rate of two and a half Miles per Hour, which might have been accelerated by the Addition of Oars. At ten o'Clock en∣tered a narrow Part of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> where it is not more than Two Hundred Yards wide. At 12 o'Clock discovered another Keel bot∣tom'd Boat, destined to the same Place with the former. At Sunset, three of Mr. <HI>Craig</HI>'s Tobacco Boats came up with us whilst we lay in Harbour, the fourth being still under the Command of the Rear Admiral, whose Intrepidity hath often endangered his Vessel by opposing the poor <HI>Planters</HI> and <HI>Sawyers,</HI> who have taken up their Residence in this spacious River. It is shrewdly suspected that the Rear Admiral will be tried by a Board of <HI>Dons,</HI> so soon as he makes the Port of <HI>Natchez.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22d. At Sunrise, espied a Vessel of Ge∣neral <HI>Wilkinson</HI>'s, under the Command of Captain <HI>Swaine,</HI> bound to <HI>New Orleans</HI>—At 8 o'Clock we had in View six Sail of the Line.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="024705_0027_0FC82D31AC922FD0"/>23d. At 12 o'Clock we ran North West∣wardly—Here the <HI>Missisippi</HI> forms on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Side an exact Resemblance of an Horse Shoe.</P>
<P N="24">24th. At Break of Day espied the Wal∣nut Hills about ten Miles below the <HI>Yasous</HI> River, which his Catholic Majesty limits as his Boundary, and below which, his Vice∣gerents say, that Citizens of the <HI>United States</HI> shall not inhabit, unless they throw them∣selves under the Laws, Banners and Protec∣tion of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> At 10 o'Clock espied a Shingle roosed House, occupied by a Family of <HI>New-Yorkers</HI>—Near this Spot the Governor of the <HI>Natchez</HI> hath fixed upon an Eminence for the Erection of a Fort. The Family informed, that the intended Garrison were at the <HI>Natchez,</HI> taking in military Stores and Provision. The River opposite to the intended Fort is about Six hundred Yards wide. Whoever undertakes a Des∣cription of the <HI>Walnut</HI> Hills, must have a fertile Imagination, be happy at Landscape Painting, and use Something like Romance, or he will fall infinitely short of that Eulo∣gium which the Place so justly merits.</P>
<P N="23">23d. At Sunrise, saw two small Houses on the Eastern Side of the River upon a beau∣tiful
<PB N="29" REF="024705_0028_0FC82D32D07A2B90"/>Eminence, from whence runs off a great Extent of very level fertile Ground: The Eminencies resemble the round Hills of <HI>Staf∣ford</HI> County, in the <HI>Northern Neck</HI> of <HI>Vir∣ginia.</HI> At 2 o'Clock I went on Board the Governor of <HI>Natchez'</HI> Barge, his Name is <HI>Gayoso.</HI> Here I was regaled with delicious Nuts and excellent Wines, This Gentle∣man has a majestic Department, softened by Manners the most engaging and polite. Hav∣ing been brought up at the Court of <HI>London,</HI> he is well acquainted with the Etiquette of Mortals who move in the more exalted and splendid Scenes of Life, He had in Com∣pany with him two Victualling Boats and an armed Schooner, laden with military Stores. I could not ascertain their Destination, tho' it was probably to the <HI>Walnut</HI> Hills. His Soldiery including Mariners and Mechanics, did not exceed one Hundred Men. Doctor <HI>O'Fallan,</HI> Agent for the <HI>Yajous</HI> Company, ardently pants for the Cultivation of this de∣licious Soil; but by Connoiseurs, it is shrewd∣ly conjectured, that having pitched his Tent in the Grotto of Miss <HI>Clarke,</HI> his Ardency, like his Constitution, will turn into down∣right Frigidity.</P>
<P N="24">24th. At Sunrise, we shot the Grand Gulph, opposite to which, on either Side,
<PB N="30" REF="024705_0029_0FC82D344F07B3B8"/>
the Cane grows to the enormous Height of Forty and sometimes Forty-five Feet. At 8 o'Clock an impervious Fog arose, so as to pre∣vent a Discovery of <HI>Sawyers</HI> and other Ob∣stacles not more than ten Feet from us. It might with Propriety have been called "Darkness visible." At 9 o'Clock passed the <HI>Bayone Pierre,</HI> on the Banks of which are three small Houses and about Thirty Acres of Ground under Cultivation—About ten Miles higher up the Country it is pretty thickly inhabited by <HI>Virginians, Carolineans, Georgians,</HI> and some few Stragglers from the Eastern States.</P>
<P N="26">26th. At Sunrise came in Sight of the Town of <HI>Natchez,</HI> situate on the Eastern Bank of the River. It contains about an Hundred Houses, and is the Metropolis of the District and Residence of <HI>Don Gayoso,</HI> the Governor last mentioned. In this Town and its Vicinage we continued about a Week.</P>
<P N="27">27th. On <HI>Sunday</HI> I took a View of the Governor's Palace, as also of the Fort; which from its elevated Situation has a fine Com∣mand of the River for about a Mile up, and double that Distance down it: though I think it might be assailed with Success by a
<PB N="31" REF="024705_0030_0FC82D3933B628C0"/>single Regiment, or taken by Surprize with a less Number. The lying of the back Ground, and the Paucity and Insignificance of the Garrison would favour either Plan. They have a good Train of Artillery, though very injudiciously arranged; the back Part of the Fort being <HI>pregnable</HI> to a Dozen Men.</P>
<P N="28">28th. Paid a Visit to <HI>Don Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frey,</HI> Com∣mandant of the Regular Forces throughout the <HI>Natchez</HI> District: he lives about Two Miles from Town. Here I was regaled with different Kinds of Fruits, Wines and Parmesan Cheese, which were succeedent to a very good substantial Dinner. Hospitality and Urbanity presided at his Board: His Lady is young, handsome and polite—His Visitants consisted of five reputable Gentle∣men and three Ladies. One of the Gentle∣men spoke the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Languages with great Propriety and Fase. Him we fixed upon as Linguist to the Company, and through whom we carried on a brisk and chear∣ful Conversation. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen and Ladies with whom I had an Opportunity of conversing, do not possess that Austerity and Reserve, which are so generally ascribed to their Nation. The Character of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is thus drawn by the celebrated
<PB N="32" REF="024705_0031_0FC82D3B19C9A388"/>Mr. <HI>Swinburne,</HI> after his late Travels through the Country.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Catalans</HI> appear to be the most ac∣tive, stirring Set of Men, the best calculated for Business, Travelling and Manufactures— The <HI>Valencians</HI> a more sullen, sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Race, better adapted to the Occupation of Hus∣bandry, less eager to change Place, and of a much more timid suspicious Cast of Mind than the former—The <HI>Andalu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> seem to be the greatest Talkers and Rhodemontadoes of <HI>Spain</HI>—The <HI>Casti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI> have a manly Frank∣ness, and less Appearance of Cunning and Deceit—The <HI>New Casti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI> are perhaps the least industrious of the whole Nation—The <HI>Old Casti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI> are laborious, and retain more of antient Simplicity of Manner; both are of a firm determined Spirit—The <HI>Arragoness</HI> are a Mixture of the <HI>Casti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI> and <HI>Catal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> rather incling to the former—The <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scayner</HI> are acute and diligent, fiery and impatient of Control, more resembling a Colony of Re∣publicans, than a Province of an absolute Monarchy—And the <HI>Galacians</HI> are a plod∣ding Painstaking Race of Mortals, that roam over <HI>Spain</HI> in Search of an hardly earned Sub∣sistence."</P>
<P>From this Description: those with whom I conversed are certainly <HI>Castilians,</HI> or of that
<PB N="33" REF="024705_0032_0FC82D3DBB561810"/>Pedigree. To Mr. <HI>Swinburne</HI>'s Character of the Nation I shall have frequent Reference, as I shall be much among them, and proba∣bly see Mortals answering each provincial Description. About some ten or fifteen Miles above the Town of <HI>Natchez,</HI> lies the Settlement of the <HI>Bayoue Pierre</HI>—It compre∣hends a Neighbourhood of about Thirty Miles in Length and Twenty Miles in Width, composed generally of People who have moved, and still continue to move in elevated Stations, when compared to those, who, though now possessed of Wealth, ushered in∣to Life without the Advantages of Fortune, Family, or Education.</P>
<P N="29">29th. At the <HI>Natchez</HI> I observed an Ad∣vertisement relating to a stray Horse, for the Setting up of which, the Owner was obliged to get the previous Sanction of a Magistrate. An Inhabitant under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Spain</HI> may be said to be,</P>
<Q>"Homo sine Spe, sine Sede, sine Re."</Q>
<P>The Soil of this District is better adapted to the Growing of Corn, Rice and Indigo, than of Tobacco, the Cultivation of which, is gradually falling into Difuse; as an Ad∣mittance of it into the King's Store is now
<PB N="34" REF="024705_0033_0FC82D3EE10429E8"/>positively refused, from some political Mo∣tives, which the Governor thinks himself under no Obligation to communicate: though the present Crop was raised under a Confi∣dence reposed in his Promise, to receive and allow eight Dollars per Hundred for it.</P>
<P N="30">30th. At 10 o'Clock discovered the Wreck of one of Mr, <HI>Craig</HI>'s Tobacco Boats, which he had directed to be got under Way. Into this Boat, exclusive of Tobacco, he had stowed a considerable. Quantity of Bacon, Butter, Flour and Plank—He lost almost the whole. His Boatsmen (for whom he now no longer had Occasion) appeared to bear his Loss with great Composure and Christian Fortitude. At 1 o'Clock moved from the <HI>Natchez,</HI> and in two Hours viewed the white Bluff on the Eastern Side of the River. This Situation is Romantic and boasts a Gentle∣man's Seat, near which lay three large To∣bacco Boats unlaunched. Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> from <HI>Amelia</HI> County, of <HI>Virginia,</HI> resides at this Place. Here I discovered the first Pine Trees since I crossed the <HI>Allegheny</HI> Mountains.</P>
<P N="31">31st. At 12 o'Clock past <HI>Lestus</HI>'s Bluff, where the River is about Two Hundred Yards wide. This Situation is beauteous, and has two Plantations on the summit laid off in ob∣long
<PB N="35" REF="024705_0034_0FC82D4123BE3520"/>Squares, and a little Way below, a fine extensive Meadow. At 3 o'Clock hailed by a Row Galley from <HI>New Orleans,</HI> bound to <HI>New Madrid,</HI> At 4 o'Clock espied the Long Reach, where the Eye may take in an unin∣terrupted Water Prospect of Twenty-three Miles. At our Entrance into the Long Reach we viewed the Red River, about a Quarter of a Mile wide, on the Western Side of the <HI>Missisippi;</HI> and three Miles below it the <HI>Bayoue Chappaliere,</HI> which taking its Leave of this River, disembogues its gentle Stream into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> several Leagues from the Mouths of the <HI>Missisippi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 1st. At Sunrise we heard the Re∣ville beaten on the Western Side of the River, where there is a small <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Hailed by two Perochs, one bound to the <HI>Natchez,</HI> the other to the <HI>Bayoue Pi∣erre.</HI> For two Days past we have been much harrassed by <HI>Musquettoes</HI>—The poor <HI>Indians</HI> who go almost naked, construct an elevated Bed of Reeds, which they Suffumigate, so as to banish Insects of every Description from their Lodgements. Slight whitewashed airy Buildings become more common on the Eas∣tern Side of the River, and are, in general, occupied by People from the <HI>United States.</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="024705_0035_0FC82D43CC5EF248"/>Here are the most delightful Prospects that ever caught my View—On the Western Side there is a Meadow three Miles in Length and Half a Mile in Width, beset with <HI>English</HI> Clover about eighteen Inches high, which depastures about Three Hundred Head of Horses, and an equal Number of horned Cattle.</P>
<P N="3">3d. At 10 o'Clock viewed <HI>Point Couper,</HI> a Village Twenty-one Miles in Length, though narrow, consisting of inferiour Build∣ings, interspersed now and then with dwelling Houses, and Chapels of tolerable Elegance. At 4 o'Clock saw eight Country Seats on the Eastern Bank, and at the lower End of some high Bluffs, a large Building of extraordinary Workmanship, and a Dock-yard about Hast a Mile below it. At 6 o'Clock viewed the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Bluffs, from which on both Sides of the River there is a Continuation of beauteous Farms and elegant Buildings for the Distance of Sixty-one Miles. The general Width of the River all this Day is about three Quarters of a Mile, or rather less.</P>
<P N="4">4th. About Noon espied the Suburbs of <HI>New Orleans,</HI> and at 2 o'Clock came abreast of the City on the Eastern Side of the River, in an Island formed by the <HI>Missisippi</HI> and the
<PB N="37" REF="024705_0036_0FC82D44D460F310"/><HI>Bayoue St. John.</HI> This City is the Residence of <HI>Don Miro</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Viceroy, and Empo∣rium of <HI>Louisiana</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Territories dependent thereon—It lies in almost an exact Square. The Streets which are wide, and some of them well paved with Brick, intersect each other at right Angles. The public Buildings are capacious and elegant. The private Houses generally neat and commo∣dious. Both Descriptions lie compact and cover a Space of Ground of rather more than Half a Mile square. As the Situation of <HI>New Orleans</HI> was originally Nothing more than an extensive Morass, and subject to the Inundation of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> it became ne∣cessary to exclude the Water, by constructing Dikes from about ten to fifteen Feet in Height, and double that Measure in Width The steady Exertions of many Hands were, and still are employed in the Business; notwith∣standing which, the Dikes are sometimes broken through, and considerable Damage sustained by the Influx of Water into their Cellars, Gardens and lower Rooms.</P>
<P>Along a spacious Canal from the <HI>Bayoue St. John,</HI> to the Western Entrance of the City, both Fish and Fowl of every Kind in great Abundance are brought to their Mar∣ket;
<PB N="38" REF="024705_0037_0FC82D464F94EC10"/>which is also well supplied with fresh Meats from various other Quarters.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7th. The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Sub∣jects of <HI>Louisiana,</HI> are strict <HI>Romanists,</HI> and therefore, enthusiastically fond of Pageantry in their religious Festivals. This I can avouch from a Procession of Yesterday, when a crucified Redeemer was crucified afresh, in being represented like a Felon, in the Habi∣liment of a <HI>Jesuit.</HI> The Virgin-Mother was dress'd out <HI>a-la-mode de Paris;</HI> and Traitor <HI>Judas,</HI> for political Reasons, appeared in the Regimental Uniform of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldier, under Sentence of Death, for having divul∣ged the Countersign to the Enemy in Consi∣deration of a <HI>Bribe.</HI></P>
<P>In this Procession, I observed a young <HI>Ken∣tuckean</HI> who had been educated in all the Strictness of Presbyterianism, from which he had apostatized, and embraced Anabaptism and Methodism, which he highly honoured, by using each Profession alternately, as Hy∣pocrisy might suggest. He was presented with a waxen Candle, which he devotionally received; and, like the Knight of the woeful Countenance, joined the cheating and the cheated Throng.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="024705_0038_0FC82D47D334FE00"/>On the Morning of the Procession, I planted myself near the Door of the Monastry, and had a faint Glimpse of the <HI>Nuns</HI> whilst thus were adjusting their Capuchins. The Mo∣nastery is near the Centre of the Town, and remarkable only for its Length, which if I mistake not, is about Two Hundred Feet. The Hospital is situate in the Western Edge of the City, where Nothing interrupts its Ventilation from the East, South and North; but unfortunately, as if intended to banish Chearfulness from its Mansions, the Priests have laid off a Burial Ground, which is en∣closed on one Side by the Front Wall of the Building. The Chapel is in a ruinous State, and will not be repaired—A new one is trect∣ing, to which, all the internal Decorations of the Old will be transferred.</P>

No Doubt when these shall be completed, but that he will be reminded by the Priests, who will know how to excite the Passions of Hope and Fear, that some other expiatory Acts remain; and which he is indispensably bound to perform, under no less Penalty than of having his Soul everlastingly damned in the liquid Flames of Hell-fire, To soothe his Vanity, his Name and Pious Deeds, will be ensculptured over the Front Doors and other Parts of the Buildings.</P>

<P>The <HI>Orleanois</HI> as I observed before, are staunch Romanists, and consider People of all other religious Denominations as Here∣tics, and to whom they not long since de∣nied christian Burial. Their Custom was to throw the Body of the deceased, unshrouded
<PB N="41" REF="024705_0040_0FC82D4FC3308358"/>and uncoffin'd into the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> Not many Years ago, an <HI>Englishman,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Howard,</HI> influenced by Motives to Huma∣nity, purchased about four Acres of Land in the Suburbs of the City, and generously as∣signed it as a Burial Ground for <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Strangers.</HI> I saw the Interment of a Corpse. The Grave was about four Feet deep. The Water rose within ten Inches of the Surface, and the Coffin was sunk down with heavy Stones.</P>
<P>Private Adventurers from <HI>New-York Phi∣ladelphia</HI> and <HI>Baltimore,</HI> carry on a tolerable Trade at this Place—They have an Advance of Cent per Cent on their Goods, which are nevertheless cheaper than <HI>Spanish</HI> Importa∣tions. I could not ascertain what Impost is exacted here, but imagine it to be about fif∣teen per Cent ad Valorem.</P>
<P>During my Continuance in <HI>New Orieans,</HI> I got acquainted with the celebrated Major <HI>Fairlamb,</HI> whose Name will be memorable from the Circumstance of his having in the Course of the last War, with only Sixty∣three Men in a Blockhouse, withstood and repulsed General <HI>Wayne</HI>'s whole Brigade. He is now Surveyor-General for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Louisiana.</HI> I had an ironical Mes∣sage
<PB N="42" REF="024705_0041_0FC82D50DBC0CC20"/>from him to General <HI>Wayne,</HI> whom I had not the Pleasure of Seeing, in my Route through <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 16th. Went on Board the Gover∣nor's Packet at the Bayoue St. <HI>John,</HI> bound to <HI>Mobille</HI> and <HI>Pensacola.</HI> In this <HI>Bayoue</HI> I counted Seventy-three Alligators, which the Eye could easily take in at one View. The Tail part of this Animal yields a very nu∣tritious Food, and on which, the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> voraciously englut and gormandize. They are eaisily killed with a Rifle Ball, dis∣charged about an Inch below the Eyes—All other Parts except the Belly, are clothed with impenetrable Scales. The usual Length of those I saw, were from six to ten Feet; though some few are now and then seen, which mea∣sure upwards of Twenty Feet. I was in∣formed by an intelligent <HI>Spaniard</HI> that they are of the same Genus with the Crocodile on the River <HI>Nile,</HI> many of which he had criti∣cally examined in the Course of his late Tra∣vels. On Board of this Vessel were Passen∣gers, ten miserable <HI>Spaniards</HI> and a poor <HI>Ne∣gro,</HI> laden with combrous Chains, whose in∣cessant clangous Sounds, united with Heart∣rending Groans, transpierced my Ear, and sadden'd all my Soul. They were under the Care of an Ensign, whose Feelings appeared
<PB N="43" REF="024705_0042_0FC82D5254482B50"/>to be equally wounded with my own. Their Fate will be confinement in a Prison Ship, till they, with many others, now in the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>house</HI> at <HI>Mobille,</HI> reach their ten Years gloo∣my Abode in the Copper Mines, where they will be excluded from the Light of Heaven, and drag out a miserable Existence under the Iron Rod of ruthless Oppression, in hard and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remitting Labour. Providence was kind to these poor Wretches. At times they were chearful, and by no Means seemed to antici∣pate the subterraneous Horrors which await them.</P>
<P N="17">17th. Arrived at <HI>Pensacola,</HI> the Metro∣polis of <HI>West Florida.</HI> There are some ele∣gant Buildings in this Place, particularly the Palace, Barrack and Chapel. <HI>Whilst Pen∣sacola</HI> was in Possession of the <HI>British</HI> Go∣vernment, it was under an excellent Police, and wore a very different Aspect from what it now does; a great Part of the Town being in a ruinous State. There is but one Tavern for the Accommodation of <HI>Americans</HI> and Foreigners, and its Rates are enormously high. Their Market is well supplied with aquatic Productions of every Species peculiar to the Climate, and with slight Industry, might vie with Northern Markets in Mutton, Beef and Pork, with the superiour and additional
<PB N="44" REF="024705_0043_0FC82D53D49B3CF0"/>Ad∣vantage of Venison. Perennial Fruits of all Kinds, except Apples, they have in the great∣est Profusion.</P>
<P><HI>Don Arturo O'Neil,</HI> Governor of this Pro∣vince informed me, that during an eleven Years Residence in <HI>Pensacola,</HI> he had never experienced a Moment's Sickness; and that all the Citizens enjoyed uninterrupted Health, except the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison; whose Mode of Living, will, at all Times, and in all Places, be productive of complicated Diseases. In∣ordinate Use of Ardent Spirits and bad Wine, superadded to high seasoned Meats and pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iscuous Intercourse with lewd Women, will disorder any the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obust Habit of Body.</P>
<P>Immediately back of the Town is a de∣lightful Acclivity, from whence issue many bubbling Fountains of wholesome pleasant Water, filtrated through the Sand which con∣stitutes the Hill. The upper and lower <HI>Greek</HI> Nation trade to this Place, where they are uniformly imposed upon by a Mr. <HI>Pan∣ton,</HI> who hath monopolized their Trade. The poor <HI>Indians</HI> barter their Deer Skins at fourteen Pence Sterling per Pound, for Salt at nine Shillings Sterling per Bushel. <HI>Pen∣ton</HI> is Part Owner of the Salt Works in the
<PB N="45" REF="024705_0044_0FC82D55607F7158"/>Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> and has it brought to <HI>Pensacola</HI> in his own Bottoms, at the Ave∣rage Expence of about three Pence per Bushel. I think his Goods at <HI>Mobille, Pen∣sacola</HI> and St. <HI>Marks,</HI> are generally vended at about Five Hundred per Cent on their prime Cost.</P>
<P>After having spent about a Week in <HI>Pen∣sacola,</HI> experiencing greater Civilities from his Lordship than my most sanguine Expec∣tations could have depicted, I departed with an Escort of eleven <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom I was introduced by the Governor, as an <HI>English</HI> Ambassador Incog. This ludic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Title I endeavoured to support, during my Passage through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wilderness of Three Hundred Miles, by assuming wise Catonia Looks, big with momentous and mystical Concerns. My mock Gravity forsook me whenever I drew over the Stage of Imagination, a Groupe of old Acquaintance viewing me in my new and farcial Capacity of Ambassador from the Court of <HI>London</HI> to an <HI>Indian</HI> Emperor.</P>
<P>My <HI>Indian</HI> Companions (from their Con∣duct I judge) were much pleased with vari∣ous Parts of my Diess which they would in my Presence, try on and pull off, and pack away in their Budgets; always remembering
<PB N="46" REF="024705_0045_0FC82D5E4994BE58"/>to make a Bow and say, "Tank you Sir, which extorted from me a Nod of Consent, with the Addition of, <HI>You're welcome Gentle∣men.</HI> The very ample Stock of Rum, Wine, &amp;c. with which the Governor had supplied use, was with like Ceremony by them, and other Parties which we frequently met, con∣sumed in about three Days. In about 20 Miles from <HI>Pensacola</HI> we reached the <HI>Indian</HI> Boundary, no Part of their Territory ever ap∣proaching higher than that Distance to the Sea-board. Notwithstanding the natural Ste∣vility of Soil from <HI>Pensacola</HI> almost to the Tal∣lipoosee River, the Long-leaf'd <HI>Pine, Hickory, Oak, Poplar,</HI> and <HI>Walnut</HI> Trees grow to their usual Height, and protect from the scorching Rays of the Sun the tall and tender Grass; among which Plants, Shrubs and Flowers of variegated Hue, and of rare medicinal Virtues, are interspersed; a Catalogue of which, shall be subjoined to some future Page.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1st. Arrived at General <HI>M<SUP>c</SUP>Gillivray</HI>'s House, situate on the <HI>Cousee</HI> River, about 5 Miles above its Junction with the <HI>Tallipoosee,</HI> which forms the <HI>Alabama,</HI> whose Confluence with the <HI>Tombigbee</HI> forms the Bay of <HI>Mobille.</HI> —At the Mouth of <HI>Mobille</HI> River, which empties into the Bay, is a Town of similar Name, of which having only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="47" REF="024705_0046_0FC82D5F36EAC2F8"/>View, I shall not attempt a Description; but only observe that it is garrison'd, and from its Locality, must 'ere long surpass <HI>Pensacola,</HI> in Population, Trade and Buildings.—The fer∣tile Grounds upon all the above last mention∣ed Rivers are settled and settling by Corn, Hemp and Tobacco-Makers, who will have a nearer and better Navigation to <HI>Mobille</HI> than to <HI>Pensacola</HI>—add to this the Peltry-Trade, which will trebly exceed that of <HI>Tensacola,</HI> as being nearer to the Hunting-Grounds from whence they may have Water-Carriage, except at one or two places, where a very slight Por∣tage will be necessary.</P>
<P>On my Arrival at <HI>M<SUP>c</SUP>Gillivray</HI>'s where my <HI>Indian</HI> Escori left me, I was informed that he had just gone to his upper Plantation, on the same River, about 6 Miles distant from his present Residence: Thither I impaired in Company with his Nephew, who supplied me with an <HI>Indian</HI>'s stray Horse.—We had not ridden far, before we unfortunately met the Owner, who, with a menacing Countenance and <HI>sans Ceremonie,</HI> seized the Bridle and or∣dered me To dismount immediately.—An Hour's Walk brought me to the Place, where the General was superintending some Work∣men in the Erection of a Log House embel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d with dormer Windows, on the very
<PB N="48" REF="024705_0047_0FC82D609B023EE0"/>Spot where his Father resided whilst a Trader <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Nation. Here are some tall old Ap∣ple-trees planted by his Father, which make a venerable Appearance, tho' greatly obstruct the Prospect to and from his rural humble Palace.</P>
<P>He received me with Frankness and Civili∣ty; modestly enquired into my Business, and promised every Assistance in his Power to∣wards my Accomodation, whilst I should think proper to make his House my Home:— Do they order Things better in France? This Gentleman to Appearance is at least Five and Forty, tho' in Fact only Thirty-two Years of Age—Dissipation marked his juvinile Days, and sapped a Constitution originally delicate and feeble.—He is subject to an habitual Head-Ach and Cholic, notwithstanding which his Temper is placid and serene, and at In∣tervals of Ease quite joyous. He possesses an Atticism of Diction aided by a liberal Educa∣tion, a great Fund of Wit and Humour, meliorated by perfect good Nature and Po∣liteness.—His Lady considering the Mode of Education to which she was subjected in the early Part of Life, is a Model of Prudence and Discretion; and could her Complexion, which is <HI>olive,</HI> be commuted for the lovely Tints of <HI>red</HI> and <HI>white,</HI> she would be</P>
<Q><L>"A Woman loveliest of the lovely Kind,</L>
<L>"Perfect in Body, and complete in Mind."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="49" REF="024705_0048_0FC82D620F3FDAB8"/>By this Lady the General has two lovely Children, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> They speak the English Tongue as well as Children of a similar Age usually do among us.</P>
<P>He has a considerable Number of Negroes at his different Plantations, probably more than Fifty, and common Report says, double that Number in the Spanish West-India is∣lands; as also large Stocks of Horses, Hogs, and horned Cattle. Two or three White Men superintend their respective Ranges, and now and then collect them together in Order to brand, mark, &amp;c: This they effect by giv∣ing them a little Salt in their Inclosures. His Table smokes with good substantial Diet, and his Side-board displays a Variety of Wines and ardent Spirits.—The General encourages his People in all Kinds of gymnastic Exercises; his Motives for which may be easily conjec∣tured — He invited me to a Ball-Match, about 10 miles from his House, between two Town∣ships. Sixty-two alert young Fellows were selected from each Town. The Goals were set up about a Quarter of a Mile apart, near the Center of an extensive Campaign or Praire.— They consist of two blazed Saplings fixed in the Ground about 10 Feet asunder at either End, thro' which every Time either Party throws the Ball with their Rackets, they are
<PB N="50" REF="024705_0049_0FC82D64D2293350"/>entitled to count one—The Number of the Game is arbitrary.—Midway between the Goals, the Ball is thrown up alternately by two old Men, who are mutually chosen by the contending Parties to decide, all Contro∣versies which may arise in the Course of the Game—Upon throwing up the Ball a violent Struggle ensues between the Parties which sometimes lasts 8 or 10 Minutes, before either Side can give it a cast; and when they do, there are others of their Opponents ready to intercept and give it an adverse Direction.— On this Game Property to a very considerable Amount is generally risqued, consisting of Broaches, Bracelets, Gorgets, Medals, Paints, Arms and Ammunition piled up in a pyrami∣dical Form. Sometimes their whole Family Stock of Food and Raiment is hazzarded.— A dislocated Joint or fractured Bone is not un∣common: Suffer what they may, you'll never see an angry Look or hear a threatening Word among them.</P>

<P>Our President, whilst <HI>M'Gillivray</HI> was in <HI>New-York,</HI> complimented him with a Selection of elegantly gilt bound Books; as also with the Golden Epaulet which he had worn through∣out the War, The latter <HI>M<SUP>c</SUP>Gillivray</HI> consi∣ders as a great Honor conferred upon him; and therefore, says, he <HI>"prizes it far above Rubies and much fine Gold."</HI> He receives an∣nual Presents from his Father in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which he modestly displays to his Friends, saying, those I received from my natural, these from from my political and adopted Father.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having spent an agreeable Time among the upper <HI>Creeks,</HI> I took my Departure on the General's Horse, with his Overseer as an Es∣cort to the Lower Towns of <HI>Coweto, Broken-Arrow</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="024705_0052_0FC82D6ADA122220"/>and <HI>Cussatee.</HI> The two former lie on the Western, and the latter on the Eastern Side of the <HI>Chattahoutchee</HI> River, which takes its Name from two <HI>Indian</HI> Words; <HI>Chatta,</HI> a Stone, and <HI>Houtchee,</HI> which signifies marked or inscribed. This Stone lies about 3 Miles above the <HI>Coweta,</HI> at the Rapids, covered over with hieroglyphic Inscriptions, which the present Race do not understand. On the Western Side of the River, upon the low Grounds of the <HI>Cussatees</HI> is a Mount, on whose Summit are the evident Traces of a Parapet sufficiently large to have contained one Thou∣sand Men. This Mount appears to have been the Work of Ages and of many Hands, being upwards of 600 Yards in Circumferrence at its Base, and about 100 Feet in perpendicular Height. On the Western Side and imme∣diately opposite to the Mount, are the Vestiges of a very large and deep Intrenchment, thrown up in a circular Form by the Ancestors of the present Race, as a Defence against a nume∣rous Tribe of the <HI>Seminolies,</HI> whom the <HI>Creeks</HI> after a long and bloody Contest of 20 Years, extirminated, and re-peopled the deserted Vil∣lages by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Emigrations from their own victorious Tribes. This Event according to the oral Tradition of the <HI>Creeks,</HI> happened about <HI>Ten Thousand</HI> Years ago, when they had
<PB N="54" REF="024705_0053_0FC82D6BF18E6AA8"/>a Giant-King of most stupendous Size, called <HI>Billy Pig,</HI> who in Times of <HI>Dearth,</HI> would stop the <HI>Chattahoutchee</HI> with his Foot, and di∣vert the Current over all the neighbouring Fields: That the <HI>Alligators</HI> got offended at his Conduct, and begged their King to snap off his great Toe; the Loss of which pre∣vented him from damming up the Water any more with that Foot; and so he died of Grief, and was burried under the circular Mount al∣ready mentioned, coil'd uplike a Rattle-Snake.</P>
<P>During my Tarriance at the lower Towns, I formed an Intimacy with the <HI>Little King</HI> of the <HI>Broken Arrow,</HI> who is friendly, commu∣nicative and intelligent. Through him, with the Aid of an Interpreter, I attempted to com∣pose a small Vocabulary of the <HI>Creekish</HI> Tongue, particularly of such Words as most frequently occur in common Intercourse. In the pro∣secution of this, I enquired of him what Ap∣pellation he had for God? he replied, <HI>Sawgee Putchehassee,</HI> which signifies the Giver and Taker of Breath: And pray with what Epi∣thet is your Majesty pleased to honor the poor old Devil? with Emotions of Contempt he replied; there is no Devil: God Almighty is too much of a Gentleman to keep bad Ser∣vants about him. Just at this Instant, his Majesty received an Invitation to a Rum-Drinking,
<PB N="55" REF="024705_0054_0FC82D6E10DC6800"/>which in Opposition to all my Dis∣suasions, he resolved to honour with his Pre∣sence. This Rum-Drinking or Spewing-Match was held in the public Square, conti∣guous to their Hot-House; in one or other of which Places, as the Season may require, the <HI>Wittenagemote</HI> of the District assemble for the Discussion of all Subjects, whether civil or military, moral or divine. Here also they hold their War Dances, display their Tro∣phies of War, and keep their annual Festival called the <HI>Busk.</HI> This Festival generally com∣mences about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> upon the first Discovery of ripen'd Corn, and is the grand Epocha of the <HI>Creeks.</HI> All the Male Class who have attained the Age of Puberty, religiously abstain from all Intercourse with the other Sex, and every Kind of Sustenance, except Water, for three Days; which from the Catharties and Emeties they then swal∣low, are called the Days of Purgation. Thus cleansed from the Impurities of the former Year, they extinguish every Particle of Fire throughout their District, and rekindle more by the Friction of a round <HI>Sassafras</HI> Stick, in an Augur Hole bored into a Piece of dry <HI>Poplar.</HI> This Relighting of the Fire, is performed by their Chief Priest or <HI>Sachim,</HI> and communi∣cated by Torches to the Master or Mistress
<PB N="56" REF="024705_0055_0FC82D722770E4B0"/>of each respective Family. This done, a mul∣tifidous Mess of new Corn, cooked over the new Fire, is brought into the Centre of the Square, and distributed with great Formality among the Guests, agreeable to Seniority and Rank, by old Men and Women deputed for that Purpose. When the Repast is over, they rise up with one Consent, and with many strange Gesticulations and loud Shouts of <HI>In∣dian</HI> Triumph, dance down the Sun, Moon, and Seven Stars. At the Close of almost every Day throughout the Year, about 15 or 20 principal Townsmen assemble in the Square, for the Purpose of giving or receiving the most recent Intelligence, whether foreign or do∣mestic, which if important, is reported to their grand Council, and by them to the National Assembly, whose Decrees on the Occasion, are generally ratified by their Emperor, who has Power also of rejecting them.—The <HI>Creeks</HI> consider Fornication as a <HI>Faux Pas</HI> or venial Crime at most: but Wo! to the Sons and Daughters who commit Adultry: Vengeance in a swift Career pursues them and cannot be appeased, but by the corporeal Sufferance of the Aggressors. Upon a Detection of the Crime, about 50 or 60 Persons of each Sex, repair to a Thicket, and supply themselves with <HI>Hickory</HI> Clubs; this done, the Men de
<PB N="57" REF="024705_0056_0FC82D7371643210"/>termine upon the Measure of Punishment to be inflicted on the Woman and permit the Women to decide upon the Man's. They then saparate, brandishing their Clubs; the Men in Quest of the Woman, in Quest of the Man.

What I have here mentioned are the highest Punishments they ever inflict, even upon the most atrocious Offenders.—Sometimes they dispense with cropping their Ears and slitting the Nostrils, and content themselves, with giving the Of∣fender a found Drubbing and a short <HI>Deck:</HI>— This Lenity was extended a few Days ago to a Mr. <HI>Patrick Murphy,</HI> who plead Justification; alledging that he was a Foreigner, ignorant of their Usages and Laws; that the Woman was no Christian, having never been <HI>baptized;</HI> and that not having the Fear of God before her Eyes: what he had done was altogether <HI>accidenta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>

<P>Upon the Decease of an Adult of either Sex, the Friends and Relations of the Decedent re∣ligiously collect whatever he or she held most dear in Life, and inter them close by and some∣times in their Owner's Grave. This pious Tribute to their Dead includes Horses, Cows, Hogs and Dogs, as well as Things inanimate. A Girl of about 16 Years of Age died a few Days before I left the Nation. She had procured from a <HI>Spanish</HI> Officer at <HI>Pensacola,</HI> a likely Boar-Pig of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Breed, which she brought Home, and cherished in her Bo∣som, until he waxed strong, and became an useful Member in his Generation. Now when her Brethren, and the young Men of the Land, perceived that the Damsel was dead; they arose up and pursued after the Boar and slew him. And a certain young Man of the House of <HI>Illesenekaw</HI> stood up in the Midst of the Congregation, and said; I will go unto my Lord the King and unto the Elders and Chief Men of the Land, and say unto the Verily
<PB N="59" REF="024705_0058_0FC82D7717DBAA80"/>the Big Boar of <HI>Chattaboutchee</HI> is slain; by the Arrows of the Sons of <HI>Ninewaw</HI> is he fallen! And they said unto him Go: And he departed and went unto the King, and unto the Elders and Chief Men of the Land, and reported all these Things; saying, Verily the Big Boar of <HI>Chattaboutchee</HI> is slain, by the Arrows of the Sons of <HI>Ninewaw</HI> is he fallen. And when the King and the Elders and Chief Men heared thereof, they drank strong Drink and grew exceeding Wroth, saying; the Blood of the Boar be upon the Head of those, who have wrought this Evil in <HI>Coweta;</HI> for they wist not that the Damsel was dead —This extraordinary Circumstance extorted from me an Epitaph on the Damsel and the Boar, who are now Jointenants of one Grave.</P>

<P>The <HI>Creeks</HI> regularly make a Burnt Offer∣ing of what they conceive to be the most de∣licious Parts of every Animal taken in Hunt∣ing, before they presume to taste a Mouthful. The Parts they commit to the Flames are proportioned to the Size of the Animal, pro∣bably about 2 or 3 lb. from a <HI>Buffalo,</HI> and still less in a regular gradation down to the smallest Quadrupede, Fish or Bird,</P>

<P>Those who live in Townships are Tenants in Common of large extensive Fields of Corn, Rice and Potatoes, which commonly lie on the fat low-Grounds of some River conveni∣ent to their Towns.</P>
<P>The Cultivation of the Soil and almost every domestic Drudgery are imposed upon their Wo∣men, who are less prolific than ours; probably owing to their hard Labour and excessively co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse and scanty Liet. A long rainy Season had rendered their Fields so quaggy that all Cultivation was impracticable; they durst not even venture to cut down the tall rank W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s which towered above their Corn.

Our young Men refuse to hunt:—their Guns are rusty and their Hatchets dull! They sell their Horses, Cloaths and silver Ornaments for Rum.

<P>A plaintive dull Monoty constitutes the vo∣cal Music of the <HI>Creeks.</HI> They are passion∣atey fond of instrumental Music, particularly that of the Violin, to which like Persons bit∣ten by the <HI>Turantula,</HI> they will dance for se∣veral Hours without the least Intermission.</P>
<P>No People under Heaven are more attached to, or swerve less from, the Customs of their Ancestors than the <HI>Creeks.</HI> Whether this At∣tachment originates in filial Piety, or in Igno∣rance I cannot determine: But as a Clue for Con∣jecture, let me relate their Mode of Cropping.</P>
<P>They plant their Corn in Holes at an une∣qual, tho' never greater Distance than Tobac∣co Hills, from one another. Twenty or thirty Grains are frequently thrown into an Hole
<PB N="63" REF="024705_0062_0FC82D811BD8E030"/>which produce as many earless Stalks, and which they will upon no Consideration suffer to be thin'd. They say a plough is nothing but a Horse-trap, and therefore never use it, contenting themselves with light Weeding Hoes, with which they barely scalp the grassy Surface of their Fields. Their Inclosures are Fork and Rail Fences just high enough to keep out horned Cattle. Whilst their Crops are in the Ground they tether out their Horses, Hogs &amp;c, to Trees, Stumps and Stakes. Tho' they have numerous limpid Streams of excel∣lent Spring Water gushing from their River Banks, yet like old <HI>Seneca</HI> they prefer the tepid Waters from their Creeks and Rivers. They scarcely ever weed, hill, prime, top or succour their Tobacco, and always cut and cure it very green over an hasty blast of Fire, as they do their <HI>Killicanic</HI> or <HI>Sumac</HI> Leaves, which when mixed with Tobacco, emit a most delightful Odour from the Pipe. This Preparation of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mac</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> constantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oke and consider as a sovereign Remedy in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cephalic and pectoral Complaints.</P>

In this per∣plexity two young Fellows very opportunely came up and proffered their Assistance in the Construction of a Raft, composed of the Tim∣bers from the old Village Houses.—When we had crossed the Stream, they proposed going with us as far as the foederal Fort on the <HI>Oconee,</HI> to which we readily assented, and found them very tractable in rendering every possible Aid in similar Predicaments.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2 Encamped on the Banks of <HI>Ock∣mulga</HI> about 30 Miles from <HI>Flint.</HI> Here also we had Recourse to our <HI>India</HI> Friends for an∣other Raft as well as a Shelter from a most vio∣lent Rain which was then descending. They soon constructed both; the former with dry Logs, the latter with the Bark of Pines— <HI>Ockmulga</HI> unites with the <HI>Oconee,</HI> and forms the <HI>Alatamaha</HI> which empties into the Sea North of <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s River, and is navigable for Vessels of 40 or 50 Tons Burthen 300 Miles from its Mouth. Late in the Evening arrived at, and continued on the Banks of the <HI>Oconee,</HI> which was impassible for two Days.—Here our Provissions were exhausted, and <HI>Turvin</HI> and myself appeared like Men without Hope, having left all our Ammunition on the South Bank of the <HI>Ockmulga</HI> at our last Encamp∣ment
<PB N="69" REF="024705_0068_0FC82D8D98D4A8B0"/>We communicated our Distress and Misfortune to our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends. They smiled at our Perplexity, and without inform∣ing us of their Intentions, immediately took different Routes, and in about 3 Hours re∣turned, one with an <HI>Opossum,</HI> the other with about a Peck of Turtle Eggs, on which we fared sumptiously during our two Days Con∣finement.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> — Early in the Morning we divested ourselves of all our Cloathing, and confined it on the Tops of the Beaver Packs; then each Man with one end of a long Rope tied round his Horse's Neck, and holding the other in his left Hand, plunged into the Stream and swam to the opposite Shore. In this hazardous and voluntary Attempt we in some Measure imitated what Caesar did through Accident and Love of Fame, when cast away. Thus hav∣ing braved <HI>Oconee</HI>'s rough, rocky, rapid Stream which was then upwards of 200 Yards in Width, we resumed our Dress, mounted our Nags, and in 2 Hour's Time reached the Foe∣deral Fort on the Eastern Bank of the River, about 10 Miles below the Place where we crossed, and 2 Miles below the Rock Land∣ing. At the Fort I continued 4 Days; being invited by Major <HI>Call,</HI> Capt. <HI>Rudolph,</HI> Lieut. <HI>Martin</HI> and Ensign <HI>Clay</HI> to spend the Anni∣versary
<PB N="70" REF="024705_0069_0FC82D90255EDD30"/>of American Independence with them. The Rejoicings of the Day were ushered in by the Discharge of Musketry and Cannon under the Direction of skillful Officers in each Department, at whose Expense a genteel Din∣ner was provided under a spacious Booth; to the Participation of which, Ladies and Gen∣tlemen from the Country were invited. Se∣veral sentimental Toasts suitable to the Celi∣brity of the Day were drank, and at 6 o'Clock the Company repaired to a large Room in Town and partook of an excellent Supper, af∣ter which, with the Introduction of Minuets, Cotillions and Country Dances, the Evening was closed to the entire satisfaction of all Par∣ties. On this Occasion Major <HI>Call</HI> with his usual Politeness invited my two <HI>Indian</HI> Com∣panions, who expressed a strong Desire to en∣list into our service, in which they concluded that a Man might wear fine Cloaths and fare sumptuously every Day. The Town lies about half a Mile below the Fort, and the Buildings at both Places, consist of very rough, slight Materials, as if intended merely to answer a temporary Shelter for a few Sojourners The Citizens however like other Southern People, are indolent, luxurious, fond of gaudy Appa∣rel and pompous Equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>page. Hither the <HI>Crack Indians.</HI> since their late Treaty with Congress, bring their Peltry, Furs, &amp;c. in Barter for
<PB N="71" REF="024705_0070_0FC82D97A30EB758"/>West-India and European Goods to the almost entire Exclusion of their former Merchants at <HI>Mobille, Pensucola</HI> and <HI>St. Marks.</HI>—In Dig∣ging a Well at this Place near the River Bank, the Workmen discovered many Strata of white black and red friable Loam, which are ap∣propriated to three several Uses, viz: the whit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Starch, the black for Soap and the red for common Paint. The latter Kind excited the Curiosity of an <HI>Indian</HI> so far, that I saw him industriously employed near an Hour, in the Collection of about a dozen Pounds which he carefully packed away in his Paint-bag.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI>—.Took our leave of this Place at about 10 o'Clock, and by 4 in the Evening arrived at, and passed through <HI>Washington,</HI> a small Township situate on the South Side of <HI>Oguechee</HI> River, at the upper End of the Falls, and moved on to another little Town about a Mile below it on the North Side, at the mouth of the Falls. I had only a transient View of these little Towns, which appeared to have been very lately erected; a Description there∣fore cannot be expected. At Sunset, encamped about half a Mile from the Road, convenient to a Spring, on whose little Stream, our Horses met with most delightful tender vir∣gin Cane. Here I undertook to teach <HI>Turvin</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI>'s Prayer, which he soon learned,
<PB N="72" REF="024705_0071_0FC82D98D8D6F2A0"/>
having, as he said, had some little Smattering of it before he went to the <HI>Creek</HI> Nation and married a damn'd Heathen.—After a short Repose in order to avoid the sultry Heat of Noon, we arose, collected our Horses, and pursued our Journey till 10 o'Clock the next Day, when we halted and refreshed ourselves and Nags till 3. At 5 o'Clock we passed the Battle Ground where <HI>Turvin</HI> had been de∣feated by the <HI>Creeks,</HI> previous to our War with <HI>Britain.</HI> The Recollection of former Disasters rendered him somewhat phlegmatic; but when at 6 we came in Sight of the House in which he had been born and raised to Man's Estate, and from which he had been driven</P>
<Q><L><HI>His lab'ring Breast inten'd a sullen Moan,</HI></L>

<P>What's the Matter my Friend, you appear to be melancholy? Oh! no Nothing, in parti∣cular:—I was thinking about some Parts of the <HI>Lord</HI>'s Prayer. What Parts my Friend? Why, that Part where i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> says <HI>"as we forgive them that trespass against us,"</HI> its very good I agree, but by <HI>G—d</HI> I don't think it will ever be in my Power to comply with it.</P>
<P>Encamped within 15 Miles of <HI>Augusta,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and entered it early the next morning.—Here my Friend <HI>Turvin</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="024705_0072_0FC82D9B18303320"/>and I separated, with mutual Expressions of Re∣gret, and solemn Assurances of lasting Friend∣ship, and future Rememorance. He wished me Health, Peace and Competence, and advised that whenever I should encamp in the Woods, always to raise a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, and sleep with my Feet next to it. I wished him the like, and recommended to his particular Attention the <HI>Lord</HI>'s Prayer, as the best Directory that was ever given to man.</P>

Previous to my Arrival here I was told by common <HI>Fame,</HI> that a great propor∣tion of them consisted of insolvent <HI>Refugees.</HI> from the northern States: but this is not the only Instance in which her Ladyship hath di∣viated from the Line of Truth and Candour.

<P><PB N="74" REF="024705_0073_0FC82D9C9EC97070"/>A wonderful Spirit for Building seems to have permeated every Rank and Class of Peo∣ple in and about this Place—A fine elegant Bridge of superior Strenth to any of its Size I ever saw, stretches itself over the noble River <HI>Savannah,</HI> right abreast of the Town, where it is navigable for Vessels of 50 or 60 Tons Burthen. The Bridge, together with many fine Houses now erected and erecting here and in its Neighbourhood, do honor to <HI>Auguste,</HI> which will e're long vie with, if not eclipse the former Seat of Government, in Buildings, Population, Trade and Commerce.—The <HI>Au∣gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tians</HI> are remarkable for their Generosity and Politeness, the Effects of which, I as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tranger particularly experienced, at the Hands of two professional Gentlemen, Messrs <HI>Smelt &amp; Wil∣hamt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> —During my Continuance in this Neighhoorhood, I paid a Visit to his Excel∣lency <HI>William Telfair,</HI> the present Governor of the State. He appeared to be a worthy honest Man, endowed with plain good Sense and great Simplicity of Manners. I am told that he is an Encourager of Agriculture and Mechanics, a good Moralist and bounteous Benefactor to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritorious Poor and Indigent. After having spent an agreeable Time at this Place, in the Society of both old and new Acquain∣tance. I proceeded down the River in a long Keelbottomed decked Boat, laden with 72

This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oat had a decent Cabin sufficiently large for the Accommodation of the Captain and myself.</P>
<P>Just below <HI>Augusta</HI> large extensive Corn and Tobacco Fields commence, and from their Luxuriance of Growth evince the amazing Fertility of Soil. On <HI>Beech</HI> Island and the Plantations of Messrs <HI>Bugg</HI> and <HI>Watkins,</HI> I saw Cornfields of equal, if not superior Growth and Production, to the best Spots in <HI>Kentuckey.</HI> On the 4th Day of our Passage from <HI>Augusta,</HI> we anchor'd abreast of <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> an old incon∣siderable and declining Village, situate on an high commanding Bluff, on the <HI>Georgian</HI> Side, from whence runs off a great Extent of level, tho' very sandy, piney barren Land—Here the <HI>British</HI> Troops, whilst in Possession of <HI>Savan∣nah</HI> in 1779, established a Garrison of about 1500 Men, aided by a good Train of Artillery, strong Fortifications and deep Intrenchments, which however were no Impediment to the rapid Career of General <HI>Wayne,</HI> at the Head of his victorious Myrmidons.</P>

<P><HI>July</HI> 20th.

<P>From this Place to <HI>Savannah,</HI> the Eye is de∣lighted with a continued Succession of beau∣teous Farms and elegant Buildings, inhabited by gay and liberal Proprietors, who in general appear to be of French Extraction.—Came abreast of the City about 8 o'Clock at Night, and altho' denied the Light of Moon or Star,
<PB N="79" REF="024705_0078_0FC82DAB462D7B60"/>
yet a tall white sandy Bluff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttiguous to the public Wharf served as a Pharos to direct our Vessel safely into Port.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning took Breakfast, and engaged Lodgings at the City Coffee House, and then fauntered till 10 o'Clock thro' the most public Parts of the City, in order to see, or be seen by, some old Friend or Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, who might probably be engaged upon a similar and equal∣ly important Business with myself. To my great Joy, the first Person that saluted me was Col. <HI>Joseph Habersham,</HI> a Gentleman who in the Course of the last War, had been a <HI>Refugee</HI> in the County of <HI>Ambe-st,</HI> where I then re∣sided, and got acquainted with him.—He is a Gentleman of strict Honor and Integrity, a safe Companion, and an easy Friend, and tho' a Mortal, he cannot be altogether exempt from the Failings of Humanity, yet few and trivial as they are, they always <HI>'lean to Virtue's Side.'</HI> By this Gentleman I was introduced to Ge∣neral <HI>M'Intosh,</HI> with whom I had been for∣merly acquainted, whilst on his Way to join the grand Army in the North.

<P>In this Place I spent 3 Days, chiefly at the Houses of the two last mentioned Gentlemen, Being much relaxed by Fatigue and Heat of Weather, I declined taking such an accurate View of the City, as I at first intended. It is however happily situated for both foreign and internal Trade, as verging on The Atlantic to the East, and lying abaut Midway on the in∣land Navigation, which extends from <HI>Charles∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> to <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s River, the Southern Extre∣mity of the United States.</P>

<P><HI>July</HI> —About 2 o'Clock P.

ther and adverse Winds arose, and so tost and rock'd our Vessel, that "we reeled to and fro and staggered like drunken Men, and were at our Wit's End."— In this Situation we conti∣nued till 10 o'Clock the following Day. The Agitation of the Vessel brought on a violent Sea sickness upon all The Passengers except my∣self, and lasted with little intermission, till we made the wished for Port of <HI>Charleston</HI>—Be∣tween the Paroxisms of the Major's Qualms, I found him to be a lively conversable Gentle∣man, possessed of a great Fund of Wit, sound Judgment, and good Breeding.—The last Morning of our Passage, I saluted the Mer∣chant with, a good Morning to you Sir, how does Mr.—find himself to day? Why Sir; I have cast up my Accounts over and over again, and find myself, upon striking a Balance, a bet∣ter Man by an Hundred Per Cent, than I was this Time Yesterday, He! He! He!

<P><HI>August</HI> 1st. Entered <HI>Charleston</HI> about two o'Clock P. M. and immediately repaired to <HI>M'Crady</HI>'s Hotel, which I had been told was, and found to be superior to any other in the City, whether for its Accommodations, the Civility of its Master, or, the amazing Con∣course
<PB N="83" REF="024705_0082_0FC82DB676025310"/>
of polite People from all the other States who frequent it. At this Hotel General <HI>Wash∣ington</HI> on his late Visit through the Southern States took up his Residence, and during which Persons of all Ranks vied with each other in paying every Homage to him, which Gratitude could excite, and splendid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ables, Garb and Equipage attest.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Charleston,</HI> the Character of her Citizens and the Nature of her Police fit her for Trade and Commerce, which how∣ever are not driven to that Extent as is observ∣able in some Northern Towns which do not possess the third Part of her Opulence. The Topography of this City, is too generally known to require any Description from my Pen. I shall therefore only observe that in Point of Prospect, it eclipses all other Cities in the Union and is inferior to only Three in Size, Wealth, Population, Trade and Elegance of Buildings. Her Citizens are a gay, luxurious People, fond of Dress and pompous Equipage, in which they give the Ton to <HI>Augusta</HI> and <HI>Savannah,</HI> who are most excellent Copyists. Was the young <HI>Phaeton</HI> of this State with his servile Imitators, to repair to <HI>Charleston,</HI> he would be to the Gentry <HI>there,</HI> what his Imitators <HI>here,</HI> are to him.</P>
<P>At <HI>M'Crady</HI>'s I formed an Intimacy with <HI>Andrew Robertson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who had beer, a Cap∣tain

The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and manly Appearance of young <HI>Ro∣bertson</HI> attracted the Attention of the young Lady, which he improved by his Assiduity, and most excellent good Sense. Altho' Miss was strongly fortified by Whiggism, yet she was ul∣timately obliged to <HI>succumb</HI> to the Prowess of the young Officer, and about a Year ago be∣came his Bride. This Gentleman is nearly re∣lated to the celebrated <HI>Robertson,</HI> Author of the History of the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Em∣peror of <HI>Germany,</HI> and under whose plastic Hand he received the Rudiments of that liberal Edu∣cation, which so eminently distinguish and a∣dorn his Character. From this Place I paid a Visit to Col. <HI>William Washington,</HI> whom I found in Company with my old Preceptor the Rev. Mr <HI>Wilson.</HI> They were seated opposite to each other, about 5 Feet asunder, separated by two Wine Glasses and a Decanter of gene∣rous old <HI>Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ira.</HI> Upon my Entrance into the Room, after the first Gratulations and mutual Professions of Friendship were over, a third Glass and another Decanter (as if by Enchantment) made their Appearance on the Table, and the Duumvirate was soon converted into a Triumvirate by the Addition of their humble Servant.

<HI>August</HI> 6th. Returned to my Lodgings where I found Capt <HI>Robertson</HI> under Preparation for a Duel with Capt. <HI>Sweetman,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman and Merchant.—I acted as a Me∣diator betwixt them, and happily terminated the Dispute to their mutual Satisfaction, by decrecing, that they both possessed indubitable Courage, which was often called into Action by their too punctilious Adhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence to the mi∣litary Character; for which their respective Countries had for many Centuries been so re∣markable, and contributed equally with anti∣ent <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> to give the historic Pen a just and full Employ—That inheriting these national Principles, what they had done, might be fairly traced up to the Source of an <HI>Amor Pugna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI>—That Capt. <HI>Sweetman</HI> had been too <HI>precipitat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and Capt <HI>Robertson</HI> too <HI>hasty:</HI>— that they therfore make their reciprocal Con∣cessions, and be at Peace; and that neither might infringe the Punctilios of military Eti∣quette, they should stand 10 Yards asunder, then advance to the Centre, make their Con∣cessions at the same Instant, <HI>protruding their dextral Hands, until they came into Conta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on, as an Indication and Declaration</HI> of a <HI>Continua∣tion of Pacification:</HI> that they should then re∣pair to the Hotel and take a <HI>Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation of a late Importation from the</HI> Madeira <HI>Plantation, in Corroboration of the</HI> aforesaid <HI>Pacification.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="024705_0086_0FC82DBDA2913A58"/><HI>Quicquid volumus sacile credimus</HI>—The Du∣ellist wishes to defend his Conduct. I will here transcribe the Sentiments of a modern Author upon the Subject of Duelling, which he ob∣serves, has in many Countries a Law against it—but can never be prevented. The Law can inflict no greater Penalty for any Breach of it than Death; which the Duellist contemns—There are also some Cases of Injury which the Law cannot prevent, nor punish when commisted. These must be redressed by the Man who suffers, and by him ONLY. He is prompted to do this by something antecedent, and superior to all Law, and by a Desire as eager as Hunger or Lust; so that it is as easy for Law to prevent or restrain the two latter, as the former. Very luckily for us Occasions for the Gratification of this Passion occur but seldom: and though a Man may be restrained from a Duel by personal Fear, which is its only Counteractor, there are very few In∣stances, perhaps none of its being prevented by considering it as a Breach of Law. In the Beginning of the last Century Duels were so frequent, particularly in <HI>France,</HI> as to oc∣casion a severe Edict to prevent them—Indeed by their Frequency, they were by Degrees im∣proved into Combats of 2, 3, and sometimes more of a Side—In those Days a French No∣bleman was making up his Party to decide a
<PB N="88" REF="024705_0087_0FC82DBFDDA0ABC8"/>
Quarrel with another Man of equal Rank; it came to the Ears of the King, who sent to him one of the most rising Men at Court, with a Command to desist, assuring him of the strict Execution of the Edict in Case of Disobedi∣ence—Every one knows the Attachment of the <HI>French</HI> to their Soverign, but yet it proved weak when set against this all-powerful Pas∣sion. The Nobleman not only refused to obey the King, but actually engaged the Mes∣senger to be one of his Party.—The above seem to be the principal Reasons why Duel∣ling has so deep a Root in the Mind of Man —but there are others which come in Aid. The Desire of Superiority is of itself almost sufficient to produce this great Effect.</P>
<P>Having spent an agreeable Time among these gay and hospitable Citizens, I took my Departure on Board the <HI>Exchange</HI> Schoorser, the Property of Capt. <HI>Robertson.</HI> and com∣manded by Capt. <HI>Baine;</HI> her Destination was to <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s River in Quest of Live-Oak.</P>
<P>A <HI>Bostonian</HI> of the Name of <HI>James <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oste,</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the Captain to work his Passage from <HI>Charleston, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> St. Mary</HI>'s to <HI>New-York.</HI> He appeared to be about 50 Years of Age, and extremely anxious to see his Wife and five Children, whom he had lest in <HI>Boston</HI> about a Year before I saw him.
<PB N="89" REF="024705_0088_0FC82DC233C6CA90"/>
He had been detained by Sickness. On the second Day of our Passage, being as yet in a State of Convalescence, he expressed in his Words and Actions a fixed Melancholy, ap∣proaching to a State of Desperation. 'Twas about 2 o'Clock in the Morning, when Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> to court the cooling Breeze, had seated himself upon the Quarter Deck and received an accidental Stroke from the Tiller on his Head.—He rose up and exclaimed, <HI>My God, My God, I cannot bear it all!</HI> and quickly dis∣appeared.—I sincerely regret, that when I saw him melancholy and despondent, I had not spoken to him—I might probably have said Something to him, or done Something for him, that might have sooth'd the Anguish of his Soul, and by exciting Hope, have chased the gloomy Daemon from his Breast, and caused the poor despairing Mortal yet to live. This Voyage is usually performed in about 4 Days, though through the Inadvertency, or Ignorance of the Captain, we made it seven, having over-ran our Reckoning, and instead of <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s sailed a considerable Distance up the <HI>St. John</HI>'s River in <HI>East-Florida;</HI> when to our great Astonishment we were hailed by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Officer, who authoritatively de∣manded of us, if we knew where we were? We answer'd Yes, in <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s River—Gen∣tlemen I can assure you, that you are mistaken;

you are now in the Dominions of <HI>Spain,</HI> and have risqued the Forfeiture of your Vessel and Cargo, together with that of your Liberties. However you are welcome to depart—<HI>St. Mary</HI>'s River the Place of your Destination, lies about 6 Leagues to the Eastward of this. We thanked the Officer, instantly put about, and in 5 Hours reached the Mouth of <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s, cast Anchor, and waited the Approach of a Pilot.—On our Entrance into this fine River, I observed the Remains of an old Fort, composed of <HI>Portland</HI> Stone, <HI>Liverpool</HI> Brick, and strong Cement, which, from its Expo∣sure to the Sun and Wind, hath acquired a greater Durability than either the Brick or Stone. The Channel at the Mouth, which extends above an Hundred Yards in Width, is generally from 3 to 4 Fathom deep, and in no Part less than 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We navigated a large Schooner deeply laden about 16 Miles up this River, and met with no Impediment what∣ever, A similar Distance we run up the <HI>St. John</HI>'s, previous to our Arrival here— I think in Width and Depth they are nearly on a Par.

small Town of the same Name with the Ri∣ver, now in the early Dawn of Infancy, lies about 6 Miles up the Stream, where they have a Fort garrisoned by a Company of Foederal Troops—The Evacuation of this Fort was talked of when I left the Place, in Order to strengthen the Garrison stationary on the <HI>Oconee.</HI></P>
<P>Disappointed in having our Frieght of Live Oak in Readiness, we had much Leisure on our Hands, which Capt <HI>Robertson</HI> and I re∣solved to appropriate to the Exploration of several Parts of <HI>East-Florida</HI>—For this Pur∣pose we chartered a small keel bottomed Boat, and taking four Oars-men with us, proceed∣ed along the inland Navigation, which leads directly to the Neighbourhood of <HI>St. Augus∣tine,</HI> which however we were not permitted to enter, and received repeated Intimations, that a speedy Return to <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s would ar∣gue the Height of <HI>Prudence</HI> in us, with which the Captain and I were by no means chargeable: For we had concerted no Plan or plausible Excuse by which we might elude the Vigilance or Jealousy of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Guarda Costas. <HI>Robertson</HI> carried in his Pocket, a Pencil and a small Book, in which he had made some rough Sketches of <HI>Charles∣ton</HI> and <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s. I wished his Book and

Our Oars-men who were much alarmed, raised a Blanket Sail, and plied the Oar with unremitting Assiduity, until we reached <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s, which exclusive of the Fort already mentioned, boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts two Stores, and a Tavern under the Direction of a Captain <HI>Kearns,</HI> who is a sensible, intelligent Man, and furnishes superior Accommodations than what are ge∣nerally obtained in populous Cities. The River abounds in Scale and Shell-Fish, all excellent in their Kind, and is often over∣shadowed by the Flight of numerous Flocks of Swans, Geese and Ducks. These aquatic Productions are perennial, and from the Fa∣cility with which they are taken, render the Inhabitants near the Water, extremely averse to agricultural Pursuits.</P>
<P>Having now explored the principal Parts of <HI>West</HI> and had a cursory View of <HI>East-Flo∣rida,</HI> I am induced to hazzard my Opinion founded on Observation as to the former, and on Conjecture as to the latter. This I shall do by a Quotation from <HI>Guthrie</HI>'s Grammar, which conveys my Sentiments. "The Air of both <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Florida</HI> is pure and wholesome—The Size, Vigor, and Longevity of the <HI>Floridian Indians,</HI> in these Respects, far exceed their more Southern Neighbours

<P>Pearls are found upon the Coasts—and Mahogany on the Southern Peninsula, but inferior in Size and Quality to that of <HI>Ja∣maica.</HI>—The Animal Creation here, are in∣credibly numerous.—What I have here advanced, must be taken under some Limi∣tation; as in applies <HI>in toto</HI> and positively to <HI>East,</HI> and only in Part to <HI>West-Florida.</HI></P>

<P>This Indisposition arose from the Bite of a Ground Rattle Snake, on the Margin of <HI>St. Mary's</HI> River, in which I had been bathing. This little Reptile is about Fourteen Inches long, and about as thick as a Man's little Finger. It conceals itself in the Dust, and makes its malignant Stroke on the unwary and unsuspecting Passenger, which is equally fatal with the Bite of the larger Rattle-Snake or Moccason, and requires as speedy and powerful Antidotes to its baneful In∣jections of strong and deadly Poison.— Providentially for me, it made its Punc∣ture on the Cuticle of my great Toe, at the Adhesion of the Nail, which prevented a general Diffussion of the Poison into my Vi∣tal Parts.</P>

<L>For such, on Earth, his blest Redeemer bore.</L>
<L>Refin'd himself to Soul, to curb the Sense,</L>
<L>And made almost a Sin of Abstinence.</L>
<L>Yet had his Aspect nothing of severe.</L>
<L>But such a Face as promised him sincere.</L>
<L>Nothing reserv'd, or sullen was to see;</L>
<L>But sweet Regards, and pleasing Sanctity,</L>
<L>Mild was his Accent; and his Action free.</L>
<L>With Eloquence innate his Soul was arm'd;</L>
<L>Tho' harsh the Precept, yet the Preacher charm'd.</L>
<L>He bore his great Commission in his Look:</L>
<L>But sweetly temper'd Awe and soften'd all he spoke.</L>
<L>From his slight Stock he had <HI>somewhat</HI> to spare,</L>
<L>To feed the famish'd, and to cloath the Bare:</L>
<L>And ever was at Hand without Request,</L>
<L>To serve the Sick, and succour the Distrest.</L>
<L>The Proud be tam'd, the Penitent he chear'd,</L>
<L>Nor to reprove the Rich Offender fear'd;</L>
<L>His Preaching much, but more his Practice wrought,</L>
<L>(A living Sermon of the Truth he Taught.)</L>
<L>With what be beg'd, his Brethren he reliev'd,</L>
<L>And gave the Charities himself receiv'd:</L>
<L>Gave, while he taught, and edify'd the more,</L>
<L>Because he shew'd by Proof, 'twas easy to be poor.</L>

<P>A minute Description of this City is both foreign to my Purpose, and beyond my KEN. I shall therefore only convey my Sentiments in a few Lines of doggrel Verse, on three Gentlemen who reside in this Place, and from whom I have recieved Favors and Po∣lite Attention.</P>
