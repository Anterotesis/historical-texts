<HEAD>The Epistle TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Understanding</HI> is the supe∣rior Faculty in Man, by which he is raised above the Rest of the visible Creation: And as this Power is the Glory of hu∣mane Nature; so the Perfection and Glory of this consists in the <HI>Knowledge of GOD.</HI> All other Knowledge com∣pared with this is mean and trivial; and will ne∣ver make us wiser or better, unless placed in Sub∣ordination and Subserviency to our Acquaintance with the Blessed GOD. This Knowledge is not perfected in a bare <HI>Contemplation of the</HI> DEITY; but when true and genuine will exercise <HI>Domi∣nion in the Soul,</HI> and transform it into the Image of Divine Purity and Glory. Hence all the vital Acts of Religion are either comprehended herein, or do flow here-from.</P>
<P>To attain this Knowledge is our great <HI>Work</HI> on Earth; and the Perfection of it is reserved for our <HI>Reward</HI> in the expected World of Happiness:
<PB N="ii" REF="004489_0003_100D57469F586230"/>Where <HI>to see GOD as He is,</HI> and to be <HI>like Him</HI> will be found to be Life Eternal. And the higher our Improvements are herein in this Life, the more of Heaven do we at present <HI>enjoy,</HI> and the greater is our <HI>Preparation</HI> for the happy State of <HI>Vision.</HI></P>
<P>NOW nothing is more necessary to our right Knowledge of GOD than that all our Enquiries after this <HI>Glorious</HI> BEING be temper'd with a live∣ly Sense that <HI>Incomprehensibleness is a Divine At∣tribute;</HI> and that it is the <HI>sole Prerogative of</HI> HIM, <HI>whose Understanding is Infinite, fully and adequately to know Himself.</HI> We must remember that the most <HI>exalted</HI> and <HI>enlarged Conceptions</HI> of the uncreated Excellencies of the Divine Nature, which our Minds can form, when stretch'd to their utmost Capacity, are <HI>Inadequate</HI> to their sub∣lime Subject, and fall infinitely short of the Glory of those Perfections, which are concentred in the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> and shine forth in the glorious <HI>Works</HI> of Nature, Providence and Grace. The <HI>Object</HI> is too vast and bright, and our <HI>Faculties</HI> too short, weak and limited, to take, or bear, a full and comprehensive View thereof. The <HI>In∣finity</HI> of every Perfection in GOD, and the <HI>Fi∣niteness</HI> of our Powers of Knowledge, between which there is no Proportion, will forever render a <HI>comprehensive Knowledge</HI> of GOD an utter Im∣possibility. His Excellencies would not be the Perfections of a GOD were they not Infinite, they would not be Infinite could the Creature enter∣tain a full View, and form an adequate <HI>Mea</HI> of them. The <HI>essential Glory</HI> of GOD, if unvailed, would confound and over-power our Understand∣ings
<PB N="iii" REF="004489_0004_100D57498DC7B1D8"/>with its <HI>insufferable Brightness.</HI> What Crea∣ture can thus <HI>behold</HI> GOD <HI>and live!</HI> It is in Com∣passion to our Infirmity that He <HI>holds back the Face of His Throne, and spreads a Cloud upon it.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED in the <HI>Future State,</HI> where all faulty Ignorance shall be done away, the Minds of the Blessed will be raised to their full <HI>Strength, Pu∣rity</HI> and <HI>Capacity,</HI> and these filled with the Know∣ledge of GOD, which shall render them com∣pleatly <HI>blessed:</HI> Which Knowledge is represented to us under the Phrases of <HI>Seeing</HI> GOD <HI>as He is, and Face to Face;</HI> yet this will fall infinitely short of <HI>Comprehension.</HI> For yet there will re∣main <HI>infinite Truths,</HI> and <HI>adorable Mysteries</HI> un∣discover'd for the glorify'd Understanding to be prying into, and reaching after a fuller Prospect of, which will render the Knowledge of the Bles∣sed <HI>eternally Progressive;</HI> and yet after all they can't <HI>find out the Almighty to Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Angels,</HI> who excel in Strength, Purity, and Glory, are not here <HI>Comprehensors;</HI> for there are <HI>Secrets</HI> of Wisdom and Grace which they still <HI>desire to look into.</HI></P>
<P>HOW much so ever this may <HI>upbraid</HI> the Po∣verty and Weakness of the most exalted Crea∣ture, it certainly loudly <HI>proclaims</HI> the Excellency of the CREATOR, whose Nature and Perfections are vastly extended beyond the largest Prospect of a <HI>created Intelligence.</HI></P>
<P>AND this <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Incomprehensibleness</HI> of GOD is not to be look'd on as meerly <HI>Speculative,</HI> to amuse the Mind; but will admirably advance
<PB N="iv" REF="004489_0005_100D574BC4502FE0"/>the great Interest of Piety when understood, weigh'd and realized.</P>
<P>DID Men <HI>live</HI> under a lively Sense of the <HI>un∣searchable Greatness,</HI> and Perfection of GOD, what holy Impressions would direct and govern the Inclinations of their Souls! With what <HI>Humility, Reverence</HI> and <HI>Awe</HI> would they Think and <HI>Speak</HI> of the Blessed GOD: being sensible that they know not how to <HI>order</HI> their Thoughts or <HI>Speech</HI> of Him <HI>by reason of Darkness?</HI> With what <HI>Sub∣mission,</HI> and <HI>Prostration of Spirit</HI> would they ap∣proach Him in all the Duties of <HI>Divine Worship!</HI> How <HI>modest</HI> in their <HI>Enquiries</HI> into, and how little Positive in their <HI>Determinations</HI> concerning, the Secrets of Divine Counsel; which are at present, in a great measure, <HI>bid within the Vail?</HI> With what <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI> would they ly be∣fore the <HI>Throne</HI> of Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> when in∣circled with <HI>Clouds and Darkness?</HI> Nothing wondring that they can't unfold the dark Riddles of Divine Providence; remembring that GOD's <HI>Judgments are Unsearchable, and His Ways past finding out.</HI></P>
<P>WERE the Hearts of Christians <HI>animated</HI> with these just Apprehensions of the GOD they have to do with; with what <HI>Abasement</HI> of Spirit would they reflect upon their most perfect Praise, and best Services? And with what <HI>Transports</HI> of <HI>Admiration, Love</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> would they consider the Condescentions of Heaven to them, and all the Fruits of Divine Care and Love, which daily incircle them? At how high a Price would they rate the <HI>Revelation</HI> GOD has made of Himself in
<PB N="v" REF="004489_0006_100D574D4BE32AC8"/>His Word, where the Light of <HI>the Knowledge of the Glory of</HI> GOD shines bright <HI>in the Face of Christ?</HI> And with what <HI>profound Veneration</HI> would their Understandings <HI>submit</HI> to the incom∣prehensible <HI>Mysteries of Christianity?</HI> Not daring to <HI>darken Counsel by Words without Knowledge.</HI> How much would this <HI>inflame</HI> their Thirst, and <HI>quicken</HI> their Endeavours after a fuller Acquain∣tance with GOD? And how ardently would they <HI>long,</HI> and how carefully <HI>prepare</HI> for Heaven? Where they shall no longer view Him <HI>thro' a Glass darkly; but Face to Face, see as they are seen, and know as they are known.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>promote</HI> these Designs of Holiness these <HI>Discourses,</HI> which are now put into our Hands, are wisely adapted: In which we have the <HI>sublime Subject of</HI> GOD's <HI>Incomprehensibleness</HI> treated of with a becoming Modesty and Reverence, with an agreeable Life, Judgment and Perspicuity.</P>
<P>THE Character of the Reverend <HI>Author,</HI> and his Performances are too bright to receive any Lustre from my <HI>Recommendation.</HI> However I must be allow'd to rejoice in, and to bless the <HI>great Head of the Church</HI> for, those uncommon Gifts His Servant is endow'd with; which appear ob∣servably in these Discourses. And sure I am, It is not <HI>Partiality to a Friend,</HI> but Justice to the Merit of the Performance, which compels me to believe, That every impartial judicious Reader will esteem these <HI>Meditations</HI> every way fitted to entertain, and <HI>improve</HI> the Understanding of the most Intelligent; and to <HI>quicken</HI> the Devotion of the most devout Christian.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="004489_0007_100D574F6EED3AB8"/>
FOR what will be thought suitable to afford <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> to the pious Mind, if <HI>these Con∣templations on</HI> GOD will not? In <HI>these</HI> we have the Light, Beauty, and infinite Fulness of the <HI>Divine Essence</HI> represented, acknowledged and adored as Unapprochable, Impenetrable and In∣effable.</P>
<P>IN these we have celebrated the unsearchable Greatness, and Excellencies of GOD, as they shine in the <HI>Works of Nature:</HI> And illustrated by many bright <HI>Hints</HI> drawn from the Glory and Beauty of the <HI>greater and lesser World:</HI> In all Parts whereof there appear legible Characters of a Di∣vine Power, Wisdom and Goodness, that are past finding out.</P>
<P>IN these we are entertained with a Prospect of Divine <HI>Providence;</HI> displayed in its Extent from the highest <HI>Angel</HI> to the meanest <HI>Insect;</HI> and in the uncontrolable Power, impenetrable Wisdom, and mysterious Methods of Divine Administra∣tions.</P>
<P>IN a Word, here the Wonders of <HI>Divine Grace</HI> in the Recovery of apostate Man are assen∣ted and display'd. In which we are led into a surprizing Contemplation of the <HI>Glories of the Attributes of</HI> GOD, as they are manifested in the <HI>Person, Office</HI> and <HI>Work</HI> of our REDEEMER; In the Impetration, Application, and Perfection of our Salvation; in all which the Depths of Wis∣dom, the Riches of Grace, and the Triumphs both of Mercy and Justice, are illustrated.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="004489_0008_100D57510E7704A8"/>
THESE exalted and mysterious <HI>Doctrines</HI> are here handled with an uncommon Force and Flame of Thought, expressed mainly in the <HI>Lan∣guage of the Divine Oracles,</HI> which gives Life, Beauty, and Solemnity to the Diction.</P>
<P>WHEN these <HI>Discourses</HI> were deliver'd from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> I have good Reason to think, that they were heard with a singular Relish and Satis∣faction by a <HI>numerous and judicious Audience.</HI> And this excited me once and again to move the Reverend <HI>Author</HI> to publish them; that they might become more extensively serviceable to the grand Interests of Religion. I am firmly perswaded that the great Aim of the Author in these <HI>Sermons</HI> was to advance the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls; I cannot therefore but with an hearty Importunity wish Prosperity from Heaven to his pious Intentions.</P>
<P>AND may the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> on whom all Success depends, send His <HI>Spirit</HI> to bless these Labours of His Servant; that they may be ef∣fectual to beget in Christians <HI>a more awful Sense of the Great</HI> GOD, to stir up and cherish the Life of Devotion in their Souls, to render them more Solemn in all Acts of Worship to Him, and more Holy in all Actions of Conversation before Him.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="004489_0009_100D5754A52C4FC8"/>
THUS many Souls will be improved in pure and undefiled Religion; and the <HI>Author</HI>'s Joy and Crown rendred more full, bright and weigh∣ty in the Day of CHRIST.</P>

<P>How <HI>little</HI> then are you to expect from <HI>Me</HI> of HIM? How <HI>unfit</HI> am I of all Men to speak of HIM? How Unequal the <HI>Best</HI> of Men, the Best of <HI>created Minds,</HI> to this <HI>mighty Subject?</HI> Let

1. GOD is Unsearchable in His <HI>Being and Es∣sence.</HI> The essential <HI>Perfections and Glories</HI> of the GODHEAD are Incomprehensible GOD is <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>dwelleth</HI> in <HI>Light,</HI> but it is <HI>unapproachable:</HI> more especially to our <HI>mortal Eyes.</HI> Yea the <HI>bright Intelligence,</HI> in Heaven are dazled before that <HI>excellent</HI> Brightness. The <HI>Glory</HI> of the LORD descends to us in a <HI>dark Cloud.</HI></P>
<P>TRULY we have but very obscure <HI>Ideas</HI> and Conceptions of GOD, notwithstanding the Illumi∣nations of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> LOOK we into the <HI>Ages</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> of this World that have been left to the bare <HI>Disco∣veries of Reason,</HI> and it is easy to observe of <HI>all their Searchings after GOD,</HI> that they have felt and <HI>grop'd</HI> as in the <HI>Dark;</HI> tho' indeed GOD <HI>is not far from us. The World by Wisdom know not GOD.</HI> Mens <HI>Lusts</HI> soon <HI>put out</HI> the Light of Reason, and the <HI>Light that was in them became Darknes.</HI> The <HI>eternal Power and Godhead</HI> might have been <HI>clearly seen,</HI> but was not; or soon <HI>for∣gotten.</HI> They <HI>became vain in their Imaginations, and their foolish Hearts were darkned, and they changed the Glory of the incorruptible GOD into Images, made like to corruptible Man, to Birds and four-footed Beasts, and creeping Things: they changed the Truth of GOD into a Lye, and worship∣ped the Creature more than the</HI> CREATOR, <HI>who is GOD over all, blessed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>How little did the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of the <HI>Heathen World</HI> search out and discover of the <HI>Great GOD?</HI> One of the <HI>wisest</HI> Things in <HI>Athens</HI> was (it may be)
<PB N="5" REF="004489_0014_100D575EF4ED4D18"/>their <HI>Altar to Him as Unknown!</HI> confessing their own Ignorance, and the Absurdities of their <HI>Ido∣latry:</HI> for their <HI>Images</HI> they might know <HI>could not</HI> be GOD, but had confounded them in their <HI>No∣tions</HI> of Him.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all: Not only is the <HI>Divine Being and Nature</HI> Unsearchable to meer natural Reason; but also,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SO is He to us <HI>after our Illuminations from his Holy Word,</HI> wherein He hath <HI>revealed</HI> Himself to us. GOD has made known so much of Himself as is necessary in order to our serving him here, and to bring us to the Enjoyment of him for ever: but no more. The <HI>Inspiration</HI> of the Almighty implies nothing of the <HI>Comprehen∣sion</HI> of him. The <HI>deep Things</HI> of GOD are re∣vealed to us to be believed, not to be compre∣hended by us. We know but little of GOD now to what we shall do hereafter, if our Spirits are gather'd to the Assembly of the Saints in Heaven; yet they and we for ever, even there, shall know but a little part of <HI>Him the infinite Being:</HI> for fi∣nite <HI>Natures,</HI> how ever <HI>vast</HI> their Capacities and Perfections, can never in any Measure contain or <HI>attain unto</HI> what is Infinite. The Light of Hea∣ven compar'd to what we now can know of GOD, even after saving Illumination, and the most di∣ligent Study of GOD's Word or the Works of Nature, is as the <HI>Day</HI> now is with us unto the <HI>Night:</HI> 1 Cor. 13.12. <HI>Now we see through a Glass darkly, but then Face to Face: Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known.</HI> But what is this?—<HI>even as I am known?</HI> Do
<PB N="6" REF="004489_0015_100D5760AF642BF0"/><HI>Angels</HI> know GOD in any Equality as they are known of Him? No: <HI>He charges his Angels with Foolishness!</HI> they <HI>pry</HI> into the Mysteries of his infinite Essence, Decrees and Works: they grow daily in Knowledge and Happiness by see∣ing Him as He is: their Knowledge of GOD is certain and true, distinct and clear, so far as their enlarged Minds can receive of the blessed Object: but a <HI>comprehensive Knowledge is everlastingly far from them.</HI></P>
<P>HOW much less then can <HI>We</HI> search out the Almighty unto Perfection in this our <HI>imperfect</HI> State on Earch? We that have no immediate <HI>Vision</HI> of his Glory, but <HI>see as through a Glass darkly:</HI> thro' the Glass of his Works, his Word and Ordinances. <Q>A Glass gives but a weak and languid Representation, a vanishing and tran∣sient Glimpse. We rather can say what GOD <HI>is not,</HI> than what <HI>He is.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To descend to a few of the endless <HI>Instances,</HI> which the <HI>Scripture</HI> gives us of the Mysteries of the <HI>Godhead.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. HOW Unsearchable is the <HI>Eternity</HI> of GOD? "<HI>A Duration</HI> without Bounds or Limits! an E∣verlasting Existence! Psal. 90.2. <HI>From Everlast∣ing to Everlasting thou art GOD.</HI> A glorious <HI>BEING</HI> who never began to be. Our Reason easily argues that this must be ascrib'd to GOD, the Creator of all Things: but when we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> back an <HI>eternal Existence,</HI> how are we lost in a boundless <HI>Abyss</HI> of Tho't, which yet the Existence of any Thing necessitates us to grant. Who can
<PB N="7" REF="004489_0016_100D5762E9853620" MS="y"/>unfold those Words, Isai. 57.15. <HI>The high and lofty One which inhabiteth Eternity.</HI> Who can search out or comprehend Eternity? Job 36.26. <HI>Behold God is great and we know him not, neither can the Number of his Years be searched out.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HOW Unsearchable is the <HI>Spirituality and Simplicity, Infiniteness and Immensity</HI> of the di∣vine Nature? GOD is an infinite Mind or Spirit, included no where, nor excluded any where: So that supposing <HI>Millions</HI> of Worlds he is necessa∣rily and equally in every Part and with every Creature in them all; at the same time and at all times upholding, disposing, governing them all. Now what an unsearchable Idea is this? 1 Kings 8.27. <HI>Behold the Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee.</HI> Psal. 139.7, 8. <HI>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy Presence? If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there: If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utmost Parts of the Sea; even there shall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand shall hold me.</HI> Here is Infinity: and that which is in∣finite cannot be measur'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Knowledge and Wisdom of God,</HI> particularly his <HI>Prescience.</HI> The LORD is a God of Knowledge: He is the <HI>Only-Wise;</HI> there is no searching of his Understanding: it is infinite: <HI>Isai.</HI> 40.28. Angels are dark and foolish and blind when set before this Light in∣created and ineffable. An infinite Understand∣ing is visible in the Frame and Government of the Universe; yea in the Formation of the least
<PB N="8" REF="004489_0017_100D576527D45D88"/>Creature: There must be some <HI>mighty Mind</HI> that has a perfect Comprehension of <HI>universal Nature;</HI> the Powers, Qualities and Circumstances of all Creatures. He who made all, and by whom all things consist, must have a perfect Knowledge of all. But who can think what this <HI>boundless</HI> Mind itself is? Such Knowledge is too wonderful for us, it is high, and we cannot attain unto it. Job 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.4. <HI>He that is perfect in Knowledge is with thee</HI> GOD knows the Secrets of all Hearts, and the I∣maginations of the Thoughts: yea he sees them afar off. He knows all future Events, that as yet are in the Womb of Time; and every con∣tingent thing is from Everlasting with GOD. But what a dazling Light is this to us ignorant Crea∣tures! as the Sun is to our weak Eye, over-pour∣ing and taking away the Sight.</P>
<P>IT is most plain from the Holy Scriptures, and is easily demonstrable to our Reason, that <HI>Pre∣science</HI> is a divine Attribute. Yet how to recon∣cile it with the Creatures <HI>Liberty</HI> is a great deep: and so with the Permission of the Sin and Misery which Men and Devils involve themselves in. When we are lost almost by plunging into this Abyss, we must recover our selves with the Apo∣stle's Words, not daring to impeach what we can∣not fathom or dive to the Bottom of: Rom. 11.33. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out! for who has known the Mind of the Lord? or who has been his Counsellor? or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompenced to him again! for of him,
<PB N="9" REF="004489_0018_100D5767517EED78"/>and thro' him, and to him are all things; to whom be Glory for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Power, Sovereigu∣ty and Dominion</HI> of GOD? <HI>God has spoken once, twice have we heard this, that Power belongeth to GOD.</HI> But <HI>how little a Portion is heard of it? The Thunder of his Power who can understand?</HI> Almighty! Omnipotent! how do they found! <HI>Absolute</HI> Power is only with GOD. The <HI>Powers</HI> on Earth would be so, and they call themselves <HI>Most Potent, High and Mighty;</HI> but they are vain and empty Names: GOD is the thing it self: Rom. 1.20. <HI>His eternal Power and Godhead.</HI></P>
<P>IN his Power is founded his <HI>Dominion;</HI> where∣in his Majesty and Empire shines forth. <HI>What∣soever the Lord pleased that did be in Heaven, on Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep Places. He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can think.</HI> All the Powers of Creatures are uni∣ted in him, for they all flow'd from him; and in∣communicable Degrees of Power still remain with him to controul the most potent Creatures. At his Word the Worlds and all their mighty <HI>Orbs</HI> came into Being, and he can cash them to Pieces one against another when he will. In <HI>his</HI> almigh∣ty Hand all Creatures are lighter than the Dust of the Ballance is in <HI>ours.</HI> He holds the Waters in the hollow of his Hand; and weight the Moun∣tains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance. His Dominion is universal, supream, eternal. Dan. 4.35. <HI>His Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation: the Inhabitants of the World are reputed anothing,
<PB N="10" REF="004489_0019_100D57690CD05D70"/>and he doth according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can stay his Hand, nor say unto him, what doest thou?</HI> Thus great is the Lord, and <HI>of great Power;</HI> his Greatness is unsearchable.</P>
<P N="5">5. HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Goodness, Mercy and Grace</HI> of GOD! We may well <HI>pry</HI> into this with devout Admiration; <HI>how great is his Good∣ness!</HI> His <HI>common Beneficence</HI> is for Number, Swiftness, Constancy, like the Rays of Light e∣mitted daily by the Sun. His Mercy is <HI>great un∣to the Heavens:</HI> like it for Amplitude, and like the Stars of Heaven for Multitude and Brightness. All Creatures are the Emanations of overflowing Goodness, and all do continually subsist by it. <HI>Redeeming Mercy</HI> is such in the Salvation of sin∣ful Man as has astonish'd <HI>Angels; they desire to look into it.</HI> And <HI>Saints</HI> will to Eternity be ad∣miring and lauding it. Here are the Treasures of Grace; the <HI>unsearchable Riches of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Holiness, Justice and Righteousness</HI> of GOD! The <HI>Seraphims</HI> cry <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy,</HI> covering their Faces; not able to behold the Brightness of the Glory thereof; and being <HI>unclean</HI> in their own Eyes before it. The crowned and victorious Saints sing of it as great and marvellous, <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.4.</P>
<P>GOD is the <HI>Holy One:</HI> there is none holy as the LORD; the Heavens are not clean in his Sight.</P>
<P>COMPARE the <HI>Goodness</HI> and the <HI>Holiness</HI> of GOD together and how wonderful are they! A glori∣ous
<PB N="11" REF="004489_0020_100D30D934E92E68"/>BEING who made us happy and holy, and is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and yet has not taken Vengeance of our Sin and Apostacy, but has meditated and with an infinite Price ac∣complish'd our Redemption; in a Way wherein his Holiness and his Grace have an equal Tri∣umph. A GOD good to the Evil tho' he be infi∣nitely provoked by our Sins! and who waits to be merciful to that Enmity which he detests and can destroy! who so loves our Souls that rather than these shonid perish without Remedy has not spa∣red his own Son, but given him up for us all! and yet so abhors our Sins that no less Atonement for them would he accept than the infinite Sa∣crifice in his Death.</P>
<P>WHAT unsearchable Holiness, and unsearch∣able Grace are here equally display'd! which of the <HI>two</HI> are most to be admir'd and ador'd by us! Mysterious Union, and Exaltation in our Redemp∣tion! which Angels pry into with Wonder! they being too good not to <HI>commiserate</HI> us, and too pure not to <HI>loath</HI> us, and not so knowing but to <HI>despair</HI> of us! They pitied our lost Souls, but the Holiness of GOD was dearer to them far than these! nor could they but with high Resentment doom them a Sacrifice thereto! Then did <HI>the holy and just One,</HI> while holy Angels cover'd them∣selves in awful Reverence, and guilty Devils lay prostrate and trembling in Fear and Horror! while Angels, could they mourn in Heaven, be∣wail'd our Ruin; and Devils triumph'd in the sure Destruction they hop'd they had effectually be∣tray'd us into! Then (I say) did <HI>the holy and just One</HI> reveal his eternal Purposes of Grace, his
<PB N="12" REF="004489_0021_100D576E42A9AFB8"/>everlasting Thoughts and Decrees of Mercy, to the Amazement and ravishing Joy of heavenly Spirits, and to the Confusion and Anguish of en∣vious malicious Devils! But how to be entertain'd with Astonishment and Thanksgiving by the re∣deemed Children of Men! before by their Sin the Heirs of Wrath and Children of Death; and now again the Children of GOD and Heirs of Glory by Faith in JESUS CHRIST. In HIM the <HI>Holiness,</HI> in HIM the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD have their full Display, their last Glory, and are to be seen in their truest Light! <HI>Whom</HI> all the Angels of GOD therefore worship! congratulate us, and give Glory to GOD on high! <HI>Whom</HI> Devils trem∣ble before and fly from, tormented at his Name, knowing who he is, <HI>the holy One of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to return from this <HI>Excursion.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7, and lastly, HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Doc∣trine of the Trinity!</HI> The revealed Mystery of the eternal Godhead! <HI>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and these Three are One,</HI> equal in Being, Perfection and Glory! This we are re∣verently to believe, but never to expect to be ex∣plicated to us. 'Tis above our low Understand∣ing, and how should it be otherwise? How should a created Mind apprehend all that is in GOD? The least of whose Works are full of amazing Mystery, and we see what is stupendous to us in the most despicable things; be it the Life of a Mite, the Wing of a Fly, or the Feather of a Moth; and shall we not then allow ineffable My∣steries in the divine Nature, the eternal <HI>Godhead?</HI></P>

THE LORD our GOD is <HI>one</HI> LORD, and there is no other but <HI>He:</HI> But <HI>what</HI> he is, and <HI>how</HI> he is, who should inform us but <HI>himself?</HI> And what he says of himself shall we doubt or deny, because it is incomprensible? Truly the more likely to be true for that! For how should our narrow Minds contain the immense GOD? Shall we say of what he has reveal'd to us—It is inconsistent and impossible? Hast thou then found out the Almighty unto Perfection? Or canst thou by searching do it? And till it be done art thou a capable Judge? Have we any thing to do but to receive what GOD says of himself with Adora∣tion? Or if we were daring eno' to enquire of GOD the <HI>Modus</HI> of these Things, could it be re∣vealed to thy Understanding? Or would the e∣ternal GOD satisfy thee any further of his <HI>Name</HI> and Essence?</P>

<P><HI>I AM!</HI> A Name that sufficiently hints to us that 'tis Incomprehensible to us what he is! A Name that checks all bold Enquiries concerning GOD, and in effect says to us, as the Angel did to <HI>Manoah, Ask not after my Name, seeing it is secret.</HI></P>

PROV. 30.4. <HI>Who hath ascended up into Hea∣ven or descended? Who hath gathered the Wind in his Fists? Who hath bound the Waters is a Garment? Who hath established the Ends of the Earth? What is his Name, and what is his Son's Name? If thou canst tell—Add thou not to his Words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</HI></P>
<P>IF he has told thee of Himself, that he is in some ineffable glorious Manner and Subsistence <HI>Three in One,</HI> let us receive the mysterious and sublime Truth, without adding our ignorant Explications of it; lest by Unbelief and Doubting, or by any bold Positions concerning his inscrutable Essence, we do affront, wrong and provoke him, who is jealous for his Name and Glory.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, That the Name EI was inscribed in the Front of the Temple at <HI>Delphos;</HI> which is the Contraction of the Word EIMI, which signifies <HI>I am;</HI> or as an entire Word it sig∣nifies <HI>Thou art.</HI> The Devil herein affected the Name of GOD with his Worship. <HI>Plutarch</HI> also reports <HI>Ammonius</HI> his Sense of this Name, which is very agreeable and surprizing. Says he, "<HI>It is the most absolutely perfect Compellation of GOD: the true, undoubted and only Appellation that be∣longs to him alone.</HI></P>

<P>LET this suffice to show how inconceivable, inexpressible GOD is in his Being and Essence. He could not else be GOD; the Creator and LORD of all. For how should the Creature comprehend his Maker? An utter Impossibility and Contra∣diction in Nature! More than for an <HI>Artificer</HI> to frame something that should equal or excel him∣self in Understanding and Knowledge! More than for a <HI>Shell,</HI> which the Sea throws up, to pre∣tend to contain in itself all the <HI>Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>GOD cannot communicate the perfect Know∣ledge of himself to any Creature. The Vessel can but contain its Measure: if we strain it fur∣ther it necessarily bursts, and holds nothing at all.</P>
<P>LET me shut up this Head with a few borrowed Passages from those two excellent Writers, Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"GOD sits above the Cherubims;</HI> above the <HI>Fulness,</HI> above the Brightness of any created Mind. Nothing is more present than GOD, yet nothing more hid: He is Light and yet Obscurity: His Perfections are most visible but unsearchable. He is known by Faith, enjoy'd by Love, but compre∣hended by no Mind. GOD is an excellent unli∣mited Nature; who only understands himself, and can unveil himself.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004489_0025_100D5777456DE868"/>
"THE <HI>Ages</HI> of his Eternity cannot be num∣bred, nor the <HI>Spaces</HI> of his Immensity measured: The <HI>Depths</HI> of his Wisdom cannot be fathomed, nor the <HI>Reaches</HI> of his Power bounded: The <HI>brightness</HI> of his Glory can never be described, nor the <HI>Treasures</HI> of his Goodness inventory'd.</P>
<P>O our <HI>Insufficiency</HI> to speak in any suitable man∣ner of the immense Majesty of Heaven &amp; Earth! As we should <HI>begin</HI> with Fear and Trembling lest we speak amiss; so we must <HI>conclude</HI> with Shame and Blushing that we have spoken no better.

<P N="1">I. LET us but carry away a <HI>due Admiration</HI> of GOD, and it will be a good <HI>Use and Improvement</HI> of all that has been said. Let it enlarge our Thoughts of him, and raise our Adorations of him; our Reverence, our Fear, and our Love. Let it strengthen our Faith, and quicken us in his Worship.</P>

<P><PB N="17" REF="004489_0026_100D5779646C2C48"/>
YOU know there is a <HI>great GOD,</HI> You say: You do well to believe it and tremble. But O what need is there that our Thoughts, our <HI>Ideas</HI> of this great and blessed Being be enlarged! Ex∣tended infinitely were it possible like his Essence. What narrow, low, unworthy Conceptions shall we at the best have of him? When <HI>Saints</HI> come into the other World to <HI>see him as he is,</HI> how a∣sham'd will they be of all their little Ideas of GOD here? "<HI>We think as a Child, we speak as a Child.</HI> And when <HI>Sinners</HI> in the next State fall into the Hands of the living GOD, and under his Wrath, how will they be amaz'd at the wretch∣ed, carnal, cursed, mean Thoughts which they now have of him.</P>
<P>VAST are the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD we see: Vast our own <HI>Faculties,</HI> the least of us are ready to think: Glorious is the Representation of GOD given us in his Word: Vast is every single Perfection which we ascribe unto him: Vast is our Opinion sometimes of the Goodness and Wisdom of a mor∣tal Man: Yet GOD is often among the <HI>least</HI> and most <HI>diminutive</HI> Things that occur to the Minds or in the Mouths of Men. We think and speak of him lightly: which we could never do did we consider how incomprehensibly Great and Good, and Holy and Wise and Powerful a Ma∣jesty he is. No, the boldest and most profane would not dare then to use <HI>that glorious Name</HI> in hellish Blasphemies, loose Jests, licentious Oaths, Imprecations and Curses, or in guilty Perjuries: Nor others mock him in false shews of Devotion; Formality, Hypocrisy and Irreverence in their very Prayers. For if GOD be so <HI>great,</HI> can a
<PB N="18" REF="004489_0027_100D577AEB0CDFC0"/>common thought of him be innocent? And yet how often are we guilty of this even in our ex∣press Acts of Prayer or Praise.</P>
<P N="2">II. IF GOD be unsearchable, then how faulty are we that we do no more diligently Study, and Search out what may be known of him from his Word and from his Works. How little should we be content in the Knowledge we have at∣tained? What a Progress and Improvement is there eternally to be made? and how should we long for that State of Vision, where all Imper∣fection shall be done away for ever! Let it quick∣en us in the Study of GOD, his Word, and all divine Things. Our Preparation for the Vision of GOD hereafter lies in our present Increase in the Knowledge of GOD.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Incomprehensibility</HI> of GOD is no excuse for <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Sloth</HI> in us. We may know much more of GOD than we do, and it is our Duty to aspire and labour after more. Our <HI>intellectual</HI> Perfection and Felicity lies in this. The true Pleasure and Blessedness of the intelligent Crea∣ture lies in the Knowledge of the <HI>Creator.</HI> This is the Food of pure Minds, their Light and Ra∣diancy.</P>
<P>SAY not, I can never attain it all: Thou canst eno', and yet never eno': Thou canst all that a Creature of thy Faculties was made for; and that is so much as shall greatly honour thy <HI>Maker,</HI> and advance thee high in Glory and Joys un∣speakable. This Knowledge will be pleasant to thy Soul; a continual Feast, Refreshment and
<PB N="19" REF="004489_0028_100D577DFB21FC38"/>Satisfaction: Yea the Fulness of Heaven's Joys are at last found in it. 'Tis the <HI>Manna,</HI> the Bread of Angels! and how bright does it render 'em?</P>
<P>WHAT is more valuable than Knowledge? What do vain Men more affect, than to be e∣steem'd for it? but what is all Science and Learn∣ing to the Knowledge of God? where is the <HI>Wise,</HI> where is the <HI>Scribe,</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom of this World?</HI> Is it not empty, unprofitable Folly, com∣par'd to this Wisdom that is from above? As GOD is greater than his Works; so is the Know∣ledge of him before that of all created Things. The Study of <HI>Nature</HI> is of use chiefly and ulti∣mately to lead us to the Knowledge of him. Di∣vine Knowledge exalts the human Soul; purifies it now, and glorifies it hereafter. This is to be <HI>wise as an Angel of GOD. This is Life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>LET us bless GOD for the Knowledge we have; and being found in the use of the Means necessa∣ry to our growth therein, let us pray unto him the <HI>Father of Glory, that he would give us the Spi∣rit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of himself; the Eyes of our Understanding being en∣lightned,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND let us desire that others may know and praise him with us. Let us pray that <HI>the Know∣ledge of the LORD may cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea! That the People may praise him, that all the People may praise him! And let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory: Amen and Amen.</HI></P>

III. IF GOD be unsearchable in his Essence, then <HI>what a great Evil is it to Sin against him, and to be under his Wrath?</HI> How evil the Na∣ture, how unsearchable the Desert of Sin? From the Greatness of GOD Sin takes it Dimensions, and is an unknown Evil. It cant be <HI>little</HI> when GOD is so <HI>great,</HI> against whom it is committed.</P>
<P>WONDER not at the infinite Punishment threatned against it: it can deserve no less than infinite Wrath. Guilt and Wrath take their Dimension from the infinite Perfections and Glory of GOD. How then do they pass all Imagination and Fear. Job 37. ult. <HI>With GOD is terrible Majesty; touching the Almighty we cannot find him out: He is excellent in Power, and in Judgment, and in Plenty of Justice: Men do therefore fear before him.</HI></P>
<P>LITTLE do Sinners consider with what a <HI>great GOD</HI> they have to do! they have <HI>little</HI> Tho'ts of him, and so easily despise his holy Will and dreadful Vengeance! Whereas an Apprehension of the divine Greatness ought to strike <HI>Terror</HI> in∣to the Soul of every impenitent Sinner. <HI>What wilt thou do when GOD riseth up? and when he visiteth, what wilt than answer him? Haft thou an Arm like GOD,</HI> and <HI>canst thou Thunder with a Voice like Him? Dick now thy self with Majesty,</HI> and <HI>cast abread the Rage of thy Wrath,</HI> or fear <HI>that</HI> of his, when he shall arise to Judgment!</P>
<P>WHEN GOD came down on <HI>Sinai,</HI> and they beheld his Glory, how did the People <HI>quake,</HI> (both Saints and Sinners fearing to be <HI>consum'd</HI> before
<PB N="21" REF="004489_0030_100D5782499BA010"/>him. And who shall be able to stand before the fovereign Judge, when he shall come at the last Day in his Power and great Glory.</P>
<P N="4">IV. ON the other hand, If the Greatness of GOD is unsearchable, then <HI>what a great Thing is it to have his Favour and Blessing?</HI> The <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin; <HI>Peace</HI> with him, a <HI>Relation</HI> to him, and <HI>Interest</HI> in him; his <HI>Image</HI> in us, his <HI>Comforts</HI> with us, and the Hopes of the <HI>overlasling Enjoyment</HI> of him in Heaven.</P>
<P>HOW great must <HI>these</HI> things be, if GOD is so great! <HI>Truly Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, nei∣ther can it enter into the Heart of Man to con∣ceive, the Things which GOD has prepared for them that love him!</HI> How immensly Blessed must they be who are the <HI>elect</HI> and chosen Favourites of this great GOD! who are beloved of him, and sanctified by him, and who shall see his Face, and dwell in his Presence for ever more! When <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Magnificence was beheld, said the ad∣miring <HI>Queen, Happy are these thy Servants.</HI> How blessed then those Souls that shall be before the Throne of GOD, and of the Lamb above! The Blessedness of Heaven must be like the Greatness of the divine Majesty who dwells there. As is his Perfection, Power, Dominion and Glory, such must the Gifts be that he will bestow, and the Felicity of his Court. If GOD were less, so would the Blessedness of Saints be less in Heaven: but as his Greatness cannot be searched out, so the Felicity of Heaven must surposs all our present Conceptions. <HI>Compasses all Understanding,</HI> and therefore so does <HI>his Peace.</HI> As the Height and
<PB N="22" REF="004489_0031_100D5784011DD7C8"/>Depth, the Length and Breadth of his <HI>Essence</HI> can't be taken, so neither of his <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN GOD appear'd to <HI>Abraham</HI> it was by the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>GOD Almighty;</HI> GOD Immense and Alsufficient: and as was said to him,—<HI>Look now to Heaven, and see the Stars—</HI> so say I— Look we thro' the immense Spaces of the Creation and see the Greatness of the <HI>Former</HI> of all Things; such is the Spread of thy <HI>Happiness,</HI> if thou art a Child and Servant of GOD. GOD himself is thy Portion and exceeding great Reward: this great GOD is thy Friend, and Father, and Saviour: <HI>He has blessed thee and thou shalt be blessed.</HI></P>
<P>VERILY, for want of enlarged Tho'ts of GOD Saints themselves have but too little Tho'ts of the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Gospel, and the Good contained in them. Does GOD offer his Spirit and Grace, his Son and Justification thro' him, his Heaven and Himself to us? and are you an Heir of all this, by a Covenant Title, of the free Grace of GOD? O your Blessedness! while others set so light by the Offer! so easily hear it made to them and neglect it! Ah, dull Souls that we have, to be no more affected with, nor moved at, nor wrought upon by these incomprehensible things! Think only <HI>what GOD is,</HI> and it gives all the <HI>Motives</HI> of the Gospel their true light. <HI>Such</HI> is his Wrath, such is his Love; <HI>Such</HI> is the Loss, and such the Gain; according to the <HI>Greatness</HI> of GOD. The Light of Heaven is unapproachable, because GOD is the Light thereof? The Black∣ness of Hell is insufferable, because the Vials of
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="004489_0032_100D578668F759B8"/><HI>his</HI> Wrath are pour'd out there: <HI>In his Favour is Life, and his loving-Kindness is better than Life.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. IF GOD is so great, <HI>then how great are our Souls?</HI> Whether we consider them, I. <HI>As the Offspring</HI> of this great Being, and bearing his <HI>I∣mage;</HI> in Spirituality, Knowledge, Holiness, Im∣mortality. Or, 2. <HI>In his Desires and Labours for their Salvation:</HI> the <HI>Price</HI> he has given for their Ransom from eternal Death.</P>
<P>HE has given his own SON to die in our Na∣ture, and redeemed us by his own Blood. He has united himself to us and became Man, and ad∣vanced our Nature in that personal Union above all Angels and every Name in Heaven.</P>
<P>OF what Worth and Value then were our Souls in his Eyes? What Thoughts and Counsels has the <HI>great GOD</HI> spent upon them? That so mighty a Being, the Maker and LORD of such mighty Worlds, should show such solicitude, and condescend to such Methods for their Salvation! truly it should inconceivably magnify them in our Eyes, and inhance the Dignity of them to us; the Redemption of which is so precious to the infinite Mind and Understanding.</P>
<P>THE <HI>least Thought</HI> taken by so great a Being, the <HI>least</HI> Thing done by him for our Salvation, would argue the Worth of the Soul exceedingly. But that GOD should <HI>think and do so much</HI> herefor, even <HI>himself take our Nature and die</HI> therein, is so amazing a thing, when we realize the Greatness of GOD, that we should have thought the human
<PB N="26" REF="004489_0033_100D5789ED738750"/>and angelical Natures united could never have had the Offering given for them.</P>
<P>THUS the Doctrines of <HI>Christianity</HI> are exalted from those of <HI>natural Religion.</HI> There is a <HI>great God and our Saviour!</HI> And how great are those Souls, and how greatly to be priz'd and cared for, which are the Subjects of <HI>so great Salvation?</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. and lastly, LET me <HI>infer</HI> the <HI>Duties</HI> to∣ward GOD from us, which do naturally result from his unsearchable Greatness; and the <HI>Mea∣sures</HI> of Grace we should aspire after; the meet Offering to <HI>so great a Majesty.</HI> Great is the Bond upon us unto the Duties of Religion and Devoti∣on, if GOD be so great; and great should be the Engagedness and Fervency of our Souls always in them. With what raised, enlarged Minds and Hearts should we always worship, serve and obey so high and incomprehensibly Great a Creator? Our best, our utmost, our <HI>all</HI> is his due. Certain∣ly we may be justly ashamed of our <HI>little Devo∣tions,</HI> when we consider the Greatness of GOD. Psal. 145 3. <HI>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; his Greatness is unsearchable.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be particular:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. IF GOD be so great, how greatly should he be <HI>loved</HI> by us? <HI>With all our Heart, and Soul, and Mind, and Strength;</HI> which is the first and great Commandment. A GOD of unsearchable Glory and Excellency—How great is <HI>his Beau∣ty?</HI> He is altogether lovely.</ITEM>

2. So great a GOD is <HI>greatly to be seared.</HI> With what Reverence and Awe should we think of him? With what holy Dread should we ap∣proach him? With what godly Fear and Trem∣bling should we serve him? — <HI>That glorious and fearful Name, the LORD thy GOD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. IF GOD be so great, what <HI>Humility and A∣basement</HI> becomes us before him? What are we? Nothing and Vanity! a Breath of Wind, a Mote of Dust! <HI>"All Nations as the Drop of a Bucket, and less than nothing.</HI></ITEM>

Now mine Eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor my self and repent in Dust and Ashes. For it is this <HI>great GOD</HI> whom I have despised. desied, grieved, affronted, rebelled against and dishonoured; cut my self off from, and exposed my self to his Wrath. O what Confusion of Face belongs to me! What Contrition of Soul and Brokenness of Spirit does Sin call for? The Heavens may be astonish'd at it, and the Earth be desolate. More than <HI>Shimei</HI>'s Remorse and Ter∣ror becomes us, till we have got the Pardon of our crying Guilt granted to us. We should fall in the Dust, as that vile <HI>Traitor</HI> at the Feet of his excellent <HI>King,</HI> saying, <HI>Let not my Lord impute Iniquity to me, nor remember my Perversness.</HI></ITEM>

To conclude, Great is the <HI>Faith, Adoration, Submission and Obedience,</HI> which the unsearchable Greatness of GOD demands from us. We must revere his <HI>Oraclds,</HI> nor wonder at revealed <HI>My∣steries;</HI> we must bow our Wills to his <HI>Laws,</HI> tremble at his <HI>Threatnings,</HI> and rely on his <HI>Pro∣mises.</HI> We must <HI>resign</HI> to him in all his unsearch∣able Providences, and not dare to <HI>find Fault</HI> with him, <Q>whom we can so little <HI>find out</HI> to Perfec∣tion: for if we are so little acquainted with the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> we are most incompetent Judges of the <HI>divine Providence.</HI></Q> And <HI>finally,</HI> we must awfully <HI>adore</HI> and praise and pray to this great and glorious BEING, <HI>according to his excel∣lent Greatness.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>what Offering</HI> can we bring that is worthy of so great Majesty? What are thousands of <HI>Rams,</HI> or ten thousand Rivers of <HI>Oyl? We and our first∣born? Lebanon</HI> is not sufficient to burn, nor the Beasts thereof for a Sacrifice. Yet may we not withold our <HI>low Oblations;</HI> the <HI>best</HI> of our <HI>Flock;</HI> or bo it but a <HI>Turtle-Dove,</HI> or <HI>a Widow's-Mite.</HI> And let is please us to think that GOD has <HI>My∣riads</HI> of holy <HI>Angels</HI> who <HI>know</HI> how to <HI>praise</HI> him; and with whom we hope ere long to be eternally imployed in that <HI>blessed Work.</HI></P>

THIS is a very great <HI>Article of Christian Devo∣tion.</HI> The holy <HI>Psalmist</HI> of old abounded in the <HI>Meditation: Among the Gods there is none like to thee OLORD, nor are there any Works like unto thy Works: for thou art Great, and doest wondrous Things, thou art GOD alone.</HI> This also is a part of the <HI>Song of the Lamb,</HI> (what Saints on Earth, and those in Heaven, will never cease to men∣tion) Rev. 15.3. <HI>Great and marvellous are thy Works, LORD GOD Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Works</HI> of GOD <HI>are Three; Creation, Pro∣vidence</HI> and <HI>Redemption.</HI> I shall attempt to say a <HI>little</HI> of each of them in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD is unsearchable and incomprehensible in his Works of <HI>Creation. The invisible things of GOD, his eternal Power and Godhead, are clear∣ly seen from the thing that are made.</HI> But when we survey them all, how unsearchable are they to us? As the great GOD condescended to enquire and argue with his Servant <HI>Job,</HI> 38 <HI>Chap.</HI> init. <HI>Where wast thou when I laid the Foundation of the Earth? declare if thou hast Understanding? Who has laid the Measures thereof, if thou knowest &amp; or who hath stretched the Line upon it! Hast thou entered into the Spring of the Sea? or hast thou walked in search of the Depth? Where is the Way where Light dwelleth? and as for Darkness where is the Place thereof? that thou shouldest take it to the Bound thereof, and know that Path to the House thereof?</HI> What can be more elegant and con∣victive than this condescending and yet disdainful Expostulation?</P>

LET us contemplate a little,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Universe</HI> together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Our <HI>Globe</HI> of Earth and Sea more particularly.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. HOW unsearchable is the <HI>Universe;</HI> its <HI>Space</HI> and <HI>Limits!</HI> Who knows the <HI>Extent of the Crea∣tion?</HI> how many <HI>Worlds</HI> there are? or even the Measure of our own <HI>System?</HI> those <HI>Spaces</HI> which our Eyes and <HI>Glasses</HI> do after some manner reach. It is the <HI>fixt Opinion</HI> now of <HI>learned Men,</HI> from what they do see and know of the Creation by <HI>Tellescopes,</HI> that there may be, and in all proba∣bility are, many such <HI>Worlds</HI> as this which we behold; many such <HI>Circles</HI> as this which our Eyes view, when we take the Compass of the Heavens with them. And if it be so, how does it <HI>enlarge</HI> the Creation to us, and the Greatness of the <HI>Crea∣tor?</HI> If our Heavens and Air, the <HI>Sun, Moon and Planets</HI> in our vast <HI>Circle,</HI> are but one <HI>single World,</HI> equal or <HI>superior</HI> to which there may be <HI>many o∣thers;</HI> to which our Sun is but a <HI>Star</HI> as theirs to us: I say, supposing this to be the Truth of the Universe, how does it <HI>magnify</HI> the Work of GOD, and <HI>extend</HI> our poor Conceptions of his Greatness?</P>
<P>How soon should I lose my self in speaking of what we call the <HI>Sky,</HI> containing as we imagine vulgarly the <HI>Sun, Moon and Stars.</HI> It would on∣ly astonish and amaze most of you, if I should re∣peat what <HI>Philosophy</HI> has advanced about 'em, by the best Observations, and nicest Calculation. The <HI>Learned</HI> think that the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> abundance whereof are invisible to us, and seen only with the help of Glasses, do not belong to our <HI>System;</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="004489_0039_100D579684949B80"/>but are <HI>Suns to other Worlds,</HI> like what the Sun (in our Heaven, we say) it to <HI>our World.</HI> And to come within our own certain Limits, they tell us such inconceivable Things of the <HI>Distances</HI> and <HI>Magnitude</HI> of the Sun and Planets within our own <HI>Circle,</HI> that it quite astonishes a common Mind.</P>
<P>So that supposing our own <HI>System,</HI> which we see thro' but very darkly, to be indeed the <HI>Uni∣verse,</HI> yet is it demonstrably such a Space as we know not scarce how to speak of, but as <HI>Immense, Infinite,</HI> &amp;c. tho' in Truth and strictly Speaking multiply this Space a Million times over, and those again Millions of Millions, all together would have a Limit at last, and not be properly <HI>Immense.</HI> However, to abide by the Word in the <HI>Text,</HI> it is a Space properly <HI>unsearchable,</HI> while we lose our selves in <HI>Numbers.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Almighty</HI> put it to <HI>Job,</HI> 38.18. <HI>Hast thou perceived the Breadth of the Earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.</HI> So far our <HI>Moderns</HI> dare I suppose to answer, just now in the Ends of the Word, having attained, as they think, to mea∣sure our <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Planetary</HI> World. And what do they tell us of its <HI>Vastness?</HI> I'm afraid truly to repeat in a common <HI>Audience</HI> what they count themselves pretty certain of. If it were not to glorify the CREATOR to you, and let you see how unsearchable his Works are, I would not hint them to you.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Diameter</HI> of the Earth is computed to be thout <HI>Eight Thousand Miles.</HI> The <HI>Diameter</HI> of
<PB N="33" REF="004489_0040_100D5798C9B79068"/><HI>Jupiter</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whiston's Theory <HI>81, 000.</HI> Sun, <HI>763, 000.</HI></NOTE> (the Star so called) <HI>Fifty Two Thousand.</HI> But (to name no more) the <HI>Diameter</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> 494,000. See then how much vaster than our Earth other <HI>Orbs</HI> are that belong to our World, and which look so <HI>small</HI> to us. The Reason of their appearing so small to us is, because of their wonderful <HI>Distance</HI> from us.</P>
<P>WE are calculated to be <HI>Fifty Four Million Miles</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">81,000,000</NOTE> distant from the Sun. And yet there are other <HI>Planets</HI> unspeakably further from it than we are: For <HI>Instance,</HI> The Star <HI>Saturn</HI> (which is tho't to be <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">61,000</NOTE> <HI>Forty Three Thousand Miles</HI> Diame∣ter, when our Earth is but Eight Thousand) is also supposed distant from the Sun, <HI>Five Hundred and Thirteen millions of Miles.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">777,000,000.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE things <HI>theys</HI> tell us, who should best know the <HI>System</HI> of the Creation, after a profound Study, and laborious Search thereinto. In all which, supposing them at last to err and be mista∣ken, what is the Consequent thereform but the Truth I am upon; <HI>scil.</HI> That GOD and his Works are <HI>unsearchable</HI> to the most improved, diligent and enlarged <HI>Minds</HI> on Earth.</P>
<P>BUT if this sould be some pretty just Measure of the World we belong to, then say, how great the LORD GOD is! Does it not magnify the <HI>Creator</HI> to you? Don't it raise and extend your narrow Thoughts of him? And will you not be
<PB N="34" REF="004489_0041_100D579AEB2614E0"/>constrained thereby to admire, reverence and fear him the more? And to worship him with the more Humility, and Awe, and Fervor of Devo∣tion.</P>
<P>BEFORE I descend from these mighty <HI>Circles</HI> which my Meditations wou'd have been compas∣sing; let us pass one Thought on <HI>Comets</HI> in their <HI>unknown,</HI> but it is likely no less <HI>regular</HI> Courses; tho' they seem <HI>wandring</HI> as well as <HI>blazing Stars</HI> to us, passing from World to World; <Q>The <HI>frightful Ministers</HI> it's probable of divine Jus∣tice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Cheyne.</HI></NOTE> that may have brought, and may still bring about the great <HI>Catastrophees</HI> of our <HI>Sy∣stem;</HI> by lending us their <HI>noxious Vapours,</HI> by raising our <HI>Waters,</HI> changing the <HI>Figures</HI> and <HI>Positions</HI> of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and the very Nature of the <HI>Orbits</HI> themselves. Or are they the first <HI>Rudiments</HI> of <HI>Planets</HI> not yet bro't into any <HI>Sy∣stem?</HI> Or father the <HI>Ruins</HI> of them <HI>banish'd</HI> thence? And so the Habitations of Creatures in a <HI>State of Punishment?</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Whiston</HI>'s Theory, 4th. Edit. 188, 437.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>BUT whither have I wandred after these por∣tentous <HI>Prodigies!</HI> Yet having gone so far, let me take yet one <HI>Step</HI> higher, and think—</P>
<P>WHAT must the Dimensions of the <HI>highest Heavens</HI> be? The <HI>Heavens of Heavens</HI>—which as <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>cannot contain GOD;</HI> how much less our Earth and <HI>visible</HI> Heavens? How <HI>spacious</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="004489_0042_100D579DE55F3320"/>as well as glorious (think you) is that World of <HI>Light and Bliss,</HI> where is the Throne of GOD and of the <HI>Lamb,</HI> and where the <HI>highest</HI> created <HI>Intel∣ligences</HI> dwell, and whither all <HI>holy Spirits</HI> are at last gather'd? How many thousand Kinds of ra∣tional Creatures there may be in the Creation of GOD, equal or superior to our Selves in our first State, GOD only knows, <HI>known unto whom are all his Works.</HI> But this we know, that there are innumerable Myriads of <HI>holy Angels,</HI> bright <HI>Morn∣ing Stars,</HI> and heavenly <HI>Hosts,</HI> who excel in Wis∣dom and in Strength, who see the Face of GOD, and minister in his Presence; the happy <HI>Objects</HI> of his Complacency and Love. Now how supe∣rior these <HI>Realms of Light</HI> are to our dark World, and how spacious this <HI>Palace</HI> of the <HI>eternal King of Glory;</HI> no Eye has seen nor can see. 1 Tim. 6.16. <HI>The blessed and only Potentate, who only hath Immortality; dwelling in the Light which no Man can approach unto; whom no Man hath seen, nor can see, to whom be Honour and Power ever∣lasting. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>LEAVING then the <HI>angelical Nature</HI> to their <HI>native Heaven;</HI> that and their Orders and Capa∣cities and Bliss unknown; let us descend to our <HI>sublunary World,</HI> and observe,</P>
<P N="2">II. HOW unsearchable our <HI>Globe of Earth and Sea</HI> is to us who <HI>inhabit</HI> it, and over which GOD has given us the <HI>Dominion.</HI></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. HOW <HI>mysterious</HI> is it to think, <HI>What this and the other mighty Orbs di hang on, or roll
<PB N="36" REF="004489_0043_100D579F6B6010A0"/>in?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Chambers</HI> his Universal Dictionary, on <HI>Attraction, Gravitation, Magnetism, Electricity,</HI> and <HI>Newtonian Philosophy.</HI></NOTE> How do they keep their <HI>Places, Distances</HI> and <HI>Motions</HI> in such <HI>Constancy</HI> and <HI>Celerity,</HI> for so many thousand Years together? The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has <HI>fixt</HI> 'em so; and at last we must submit to say with <HI>Job,</HI> 26.7. <HI>He stretcheth forth the North over the empty Place, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</HI> It has no visible Foundations, but is like a Ball hanging in the Air, we know not how.</P>
<P>THE Almighty put this among his <HI>Queries</HI> to <HI>Job,</HI> 38.6. <HI>Where upon are the Foundations there∣of fastned? or who laid the Corner-Stone thereof? or who shut up the Sea with Doors, and brake up for it it's decreed Place?</HI> How unsearchable is the <HI>Law of it's Center</HI> or <HI>Gravitation,</HI> whereon it is fixt? <HI>He has founded it upon the Seas,</HI> says the <HI>Psalmist, and established it upon the Floods.</HI> But these Expressions do but <HI>confess and amplify</HI> upon the <HI>Mystery</HI> of its Scituation and Consistence where it is. Psal. 104.5. <HI>He laid the Foundation of the Earth that it should not be removed for ever; he cover'd it with the Deep as with a Garment.</HI> This is all that GOD sees good to tell us of the matter. Psal. 33 8. <HI>Let all the Earth fear the Lord; let all the Inhabitants of the World stand in awe of him: for he spake and it was done, he commanded and it stood fast.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 HOW unsearchable are the <HI>Clouds which water the Earth.</HI> I will not go back again so far as
<PB N="37" REF="004489_0044_100D57A1AA2EACF0"/>the <HI>Moon,</HI> which is a Body inferior to our <HI>Earth;</HI> nor speak of its <HI>mysterious Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Flux</HI> and Reflux of the <HI>Sea,</HI> the <HI>Juices</HI> of Plants and Trees, the <HI>Humours</HI> of our Bodies, and those of o∣ther <HI>Animals.</HI> But to <HI>ascend</HI> no higher than the <HI>Clouds,</HI> which in Storms of Rain and Thunder do often <HI>descend</HI> lower than the Tops of our Moun∣tains and Hills; — what a <HI>Mystery are they</HI> to us? Let us meditate them with <HI>Eliba,</HI> Job 36. 26, 29. <HI>Behold, GOD is great, end we know him not; he maketh small the Drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof!— Can any understand the Spreading of the Clouds, or the Noise of his Tabernacle? Behold, he spreadeth his Light upon it,</HI> and by the Terrors of his Light∣nings <HI>he judgeth the People.</HI> Read on in the 37th <HI>Chap. At this also my Heart trembleth and is moved out of his Place. Hear attentively the Noise of his Voice, and the Sound that goeth out of his Mouth. He directeth it under the whole Heaven, and his Lightning unto the Ends of the Earth: Af∣ter it a Voice roareth, — GOD thundreth mar∣velously —; Great things deeth he which we can∣not compretend. — Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous Works of GOD. — Dost thou know the Ballancings of the Clouds, the wondrous Work of Him that is perfect in Knowledge?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>EVERY Creature here on Earth,</HI> even to the <HI>lowest Degrees of Life,</HI> are mysterious and un∣searchable. So is the very <HI>Grass</HI> we tread on, and every <HI>Weed</HI> in the Field, as well as the green <HI>Herb</HI> and painted <HI>Flower</HI> in the Garden. We are ignorant how these <HI>grow,</HI> and what <HI>dies</HI> and
<PB N="38" REF="004489_0045_100D57A3D6297E10"/>colours them, so that <HI>Solomon in all his Glory</HI> was never in any like Array. But then the <HI>living Creatures</HI> in the Air, Earth and Sea are an inex∣pressible <HI>Variety</HI> of divine Workmanship, both for <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Use.</HI> So are the <HI>Furrs</HI> of the Beasts, the gaudy <HI>Feathers</HI> of the Birds, and the silver <HI>Scales</HI> of the Fish. Innumerable <HI>Wonders</HI> fill the Land and Sea and Air. The most com∣mon Creatures <HI>wear 'em;</HI> whether we discern it in 'em as we might and should, or not. The <HI>Al∣mighty</HI> therefore sent <HI>Job</HI> to consider the wild <HI>Goats</HI> of the Rocks, and the wild <HI>Asses</HI> of the bar∣ren Wilderness.</P>
<P><HI>THREE Things</HI> are unsearchable in the Crea∣tures, which I would <HI>select</HI> out of the many <HI>thou∣sand</HI> Instances that might be given.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Minuteness</HI> of some of the wonderful Works of GOD is unsearchable. The <HI>Discoveries</HI> of this kind made by <HI>Microscopes</HI> are astonishing. In less far than a <HI>Grain of Sand</HI> we find as curious Workmanship, Proportions, Imbroideries, Parts and Figures, as you see in any of the greater Creatures. No Man alive can say how small a <HI>Dust</HI> may be animated, and be a perfect living Creature. But then how incomprehensibly <HI>fine</HI> are the Parts and Proportions of that animated <HI>Mite?</HI> The Wing of a <HI>Moth</HI> is seen to contain as perfect and <HI>gay Feathers,</HI> as do the goodly Wings of the <HI>Peacock.</HI> This we see with our Eyes by the help of <HI>Glasses.</HI> The <HI>Grain</HI> of a common Chip of Wood, and more of a piece of Cork or Spunge, and more yet the <HI>Wing of a Fly,</HI> are all such delicate Embroideries as the Necks
<PB N="39" REF="004489_0046_100D57A6009A8E68"/>of <HI>Queens</HI> never wear. The <HI>Crowns of Princes</HI> are nothing so magnificent as what GOD has set on the Head of a <HI>Fly:</HI> nor their polish'd <HI>Armour</HI> to be compar'd to the silver <HI>Studds</HI> wherein the Body of this despicable Creature is <HI>incas'd.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the smallest <HI>Insect</HI> is full of Wonders. The <HI>Greatness</HI> of the Creator is seen in the <HI>least</HI> Things, as much as in the <HI>greater:</HI> but the <HI>Mini∣mum quod sit</HI> can never be known by us. It was the <HI>Saying</HI> of the religious and learned Judge <HI>Hale;</HI> That if a Man should spend his whole Life in the Study of one poor <HI>Fly,</HI> he could not with the most singular Wit discover one Half of the Wonders therein. The Great GOD, out of the infinite Riches and Fulness of his Perfection, crouds unsearchable Treasures into the Compass of a Grain of Sand.</P>
<P N="2">2. ON the other Hand, How unsearchable are the Wonders of divine Power and Majesty, in the Creatures <HI>of greater Bulk and Magnitude?</HI> There are not wanting <HI>huge</HI> and <HI>vaster</HI> Creatures, as well as smaller and more <HI>minute;</HI> together with innumerable <HI>intervening Kinds</HI> and Degrees, be∣tween the <HI>Humm-Bird</HI> and the <HI>Ostritch,</HI> between the <HI>Mite</HI> and the <HI>Elephant,</HI> between the <HI>Shrimp</HI> and the <HI>Whale.</HI> The <HI>Almighty</HI> instances to <HI>Job</HI> in the greater Creatures of one Kind and of ano∣ther; the <HI>Ostrich,</HI> the <HI>Horse,</HI> the <HI>Elephant,</HI> and the <HI>Crocodile.</HI> These are some of the <HI>chief</HI> of the Ways of GOD Hear the Words of GOD con∣cerning the <HI>last</HI> of them: Job 41.12. &amp;c. <HI>I will not conceal his Parts, nor his Power, nor his comely Proportion; who can open the Doors of his Face?
<PB N="40" REF="004489_0047_100D57A8CA627A50"/>his Teeth are terrible round about. — When be raiseth up himself the Mighty are afraid: — be esteemeth Iron as Straw, and Brass as rotten Wood: — he makes the Deep to boil as a Pot,</HI> (to swell and foam by his strong Motion.)— <HI>Upon Earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</HI> When <HI>Job</HI> had heard this magnificent De∣scription of this single Creature, he immediately reply'd to GOD with the utmost Abasement; <HI>I know that thou canst do every Thing, and that no Tho't can be withbolden from thee: — Now mine Eye seeth thee,</HI> in thy Works, <HI>wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> I had tho't also to have said.</P>
<P N="3">3. How unsearchable the <HI>Instinct</HI> of the Crea∣tures is? which is to them instead of <HI>Reason;</HI> and whereby even some of the <HI>least and vilest</HI> of them do act with that <HI>Art, Prudence, Sagacity</HI> and <HI>Foresight</HI> as may instruct, shame and astonish Man∣kind. Such is the Wisdom and Diligence of the <HI>Ant and Bee,</HI> the <HI>Spiders</HI> Webb, the <HI>Wasps</HI> Nest, and the <HI>Beavers</HI> House: <HI>these</HI> and other Things are <HI>little</HI> upon Earth, but <HI>exceeding wise.</HI> Inimi∣table their Works. The most <HI>despised</HI> things hath GOD chosen to <HI>vie</HI> with all human Under∣standing and Discretion. Thus in all Creatures, even to the lowest Degrees of Life, we see the <HI>unsearchable Greatness</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. To have done with these <HI>Instances</HI> in the vi∣sible Creation, and to rise the <HI>highest</HI> in them on the Earth, <HI>We our Selves are unsearchable to our Selves;</HI> both in the Formation of our <HI>Bodies,</HI> &amp; in the Nature and Faculties of our immortal <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="41" REF="004489_0048_100D57AAEFCD32A8"/>
1. <HI>OUR Bodies</HI> are a stupendous Piece of divine Workmanship. We are <HI>fearfully and wonder∣fully made:</HI> Psal. 139.13. yet originally of the <HI>Clay.</HI> But who knows the <HI>Mystery</HI> of his own <HI>Formation?</HI> or can <HI>dissect</HI> and <HI>anatomize</HI> himself? So as to display the Wonders of every <HI>Vessel, Artery</HI> and <HI>Fibre</HI> in his Flesh? Our <HI>Sustentation</HI> also is next to miraculous, our <HI>Life</HI> hanging on so many fine Threads. Confider the <HI>Elegance</HI> of the whole <HI>Form,</HI> the Harmony and <HI>Use</HI> of every Part, and how the <HI>Frame</HI> answers the Ends of a <HI>rational Nature,</HI> in respect of <HI>Dominion</HI> over the Creatures, <HI>Society, Discourse</HI> and <HI>Worshipping</HI> GOD; and we must needs see much of the <HI>Great∣ness</HI> of GOD in these <HI>Bodies</HI> of Clay.</P>
<P N="2">2. How much more unsearchable are our <HI>Sculs,</HI> the more immediate <HI>Offspring</HI> &amp; express <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> Indeed we have but poor and confus'd <HI>Ideas</HI> of our own Souls; but that we have Souls we feel and know, being endowed with such <HI>Faculties</HI> as can in no wise agree to <HI>Matter</HI> in it self alone, but only to a <HI>spiritual Nature.</HI> We find in our selves the <HI>Powers</HI> of thinking, reasoning, remembring, willing, choosing, desiring, loathing, self-judging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We can easily argue that these do not belong to dull and stupid <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI> and therefore that there is in us a <HI>Spirit,</HI> which tho' <HI>united</HI> to this Body is yet <HI>distinct</HI> from it, and <HI>performs</HI> these noble and superior Opera∣tions, and by its vital Union <HI>enlivens</HI> and uses the Body in its various Offices and Actions of Life, to whose Service therefore the Body is a∣dapted. It is the <HI>living Soul</HI> that gives the Body
<PB N="42" REF="004489_0049_100D57AC7890E178"/>its Life, Majesty, Beauty, Vigour: without <HI>this</HI> it becomes a Carcase, unsightly, gastly, noisome. The Soul sits on the <HI>Eye,</HI> and issues out its Will at the <HI>Lips,</HI> and all the <HI>Members</HI> are under its Authority.</P>
<P>MOST wonderful is the strict <HI>Union</HI> of Soul and Body, in which Union both do delight inexpressi∣bly, and by a most tender <HI>Sympathy</HI> share in each others Joys and Sufferings. But what Art or Power could join <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Matter</HI> thus toge∣ther? and make them so natural that their Ease and Pain, their Pleasure and their Grief should be one and the same! What has so endear'd Things so widely different in their Natures!</P>
<P>THUS are we a Mystery to our selves, and find that within our selves which we know not how to describe: A <HI>Mind,</HI> a <HI>Will,</HI> a <HI>Conscience, Desires and Affections,</HI> which <HI>how</HI> they are, and how we received them, and how we exercise'em we know very imperfectly: but that we have 'em, and that we exercise 'em we are very sure. We know we have Souls by their <HI>Operations,</HI> but <HI>what</HI> they are, or where <HI>seated</HI> in the Body, or how <HI>united</HI> to it, or how they <HI>suffer</HI> from it, or it from them, is all inconceivable to us.</P>
<P>THE Soul of Man is a most wonderful thing; the <HI>Light</HI> is not brighter nor swister than its Mo∣tion; it surveys the visible World in a Moment of Time, and forms Images of infinite invisible Things. It is made to <HI>rule,</HI> to rule the Body, and over the lower Creatures, yea and one <HI>single Mind</HI> over mighty <HI>Nations.</HI> It is nobly endow'd,
<PB N="43" REF="004489_0050_100D57AEA0C12990"/>and form'd for great things. A sovereign Power resides in it: high are its Attainments: Itascends to GOD and Heaven, can know much of him who is invisible, be <HI>like</HI> him, <HI>honour and glorify</HI> him: which is more than to say, that it can <HI>dive</HI> into the Secrets of <HI>Nature,</HI> take the Rule of the <HI>Universe,</HI> and <HI>enjoy</HI> the <HI>Good</HI> of every Thing in it. How transcendently Great and Glorious is the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Former</HI> of these <HI>noble Beings,</HI> the Spi∣rits of Men.</P>
<P>Now if we know not our <HI>little Selves,</HI> how shall we conceive of GOD? if we are puzled in our Searches into the Nature of a <HI>finite Spirit,</HI> the Perfection and Powers of an <HI>Angel</HI> or human Soul, how shall we understand Him who is the <HI>infinite and eternal Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, If the <HI>Creatures</HI> be unsearcha∣ble, much more is the CREATOR incomprehensi∣ble. If such dazling Wisdom and Perfection shines forth in the <HI>things that are made,</HI> what then is the <HI>Light</HI> wherein GOD <HI>dwells? Whom no Man hath seen nor can see.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this while I have omitted to speak of that <HI>first</HI> and most wondrous Work of GOD, the <HI>Light:</HI> by which we see all other Things, and the eter∣nal GODHEAD <HI>clearly</HI> in them, but least of all is it seen it <HI>self.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> <Q>It is the great <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Blessing</HI> of the <HI>Universe;</HI> and like the <HI>first-horn</HI> it doth of all Bodies most resemble its <HI>great Parent,</HI> the Father of Light and Glory; in Purity, Brightness, Beneficence, and <HI>Spiritu∣ality;</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="004489_0051_100D57B027A29B40"/>for of all things visible Light comes the nearest to the Nature of a <HI>Spirit.</HI></Q> There is nothing more excellent and admirable in the vi∣sible Creation of GOD. <HI>An immense flowing Tide of Glory.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Milton.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Etherial Stream!</HI> thy Fountain who can tell? "Before the Sun, before the Heavens thou wert. The <HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>Rays</HI> of Light is ama∣zing, and so the infinite endless <HI>Emissions</HI> of ma∣ny Millions of them every Moment of Time, for so many thousand Years together, without any sensible Diminution. What a <HI>vast Globe</HI> of Flame must it be, and how extreamly <HI>small</HI> and fine the Particles of Light! Immense the <HI>Benefit</HI> also of its <HI>Effusions</HI> to all the distant rolling Worlds, in the Center of which it stands. It was it may be the most <HI>excusable</HI> of all the <HI>Pagan Idolatries</HI> to wor∣ship the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, <HI>where is the Way where Light dwelleth? and by what Way is the Light parted? that thou shouldest take it to the Bound thereof, and know the Parth to the House thereof?</HI> Job 38. 19, 20. All our <HI>Hypotheses</HI> of the Light are full of <HI>Darkness</HI> and Obsecurity. We are lost and struck <HI>blind</HI> with the Excess of Radiancy and Lustre. But how much more doth GOD dwell in Light <HI>unapproachable,</HI> and full of Glory!</P>
<P>GIVE me leave to add upon the whole,</P>
<P N="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD that thines forth in the Work of <HI>Creation.</HI> To <HI>crease</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="004489_0052_100D57B2EA330638"/>is the Top of almighty Power. By a Word to command all things into <HI>Being,</HI> out of <HI>Nothing.</HI> How <HI>great</HI> is it to do this! Rev. 4.11. <HI>Thine is the Power, — for thou hast created all things.</HI> psal. 150 <HI>Praise him in the Firmament of his Power:</HI> (i. e. for here is the admirable Evidence of it, within the Compass of the <HI>Firmament,</HI> where∣in are so many vast Effects of it to be seen:) <HI>Praise him for his mighty Acts; praise him for his excellent Greatness.</HI></P>
<P>HERE God <HI>began</HI> to shew his Greatness and his mighty Hand, and what GOD is there that can do according to these Works and this Might? <HI>Moses</HI> his Account of the Creation is the most <HI>au∣gust, absolute</HI> and worthy of GOD that can be: <HI>And GOD said, Let there Light, and there was Light: Let a Firmament be, and it was, Let the Warers bring forth abundantly,</HI> &amp;c. How easy is every thing to this powerful Will and Word? He spake and it was done, he commanded and things were! By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hosts of them by the Breath of his Mouth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.6.</P>
<P>AN <HI>instantaneous Production</HI> by a Word was incomprehensible to the <HI>old Philosopher Aristotle;</HI> he chose therefore to allow the <HI>Eternity of Mat∣ter</HI> and of the World. He err'd not knowing the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD. By <HI>Faith</HI> we understand that the <HI>Worlds</HI> were framed by the World of GOD. Heb. 11.3. <HI>He commanded and they were created.</HI> Psal. 148. <HI>5. Thus saith the LORD of Hosts, the GOD of Israel,—I have made the Earth, the Man and the Beast that are
<PB N="46" REF="004489_0053_100D57B647E20548"/>Upon the Ground, by my great Power, and by my stretched-out Arm,</HI> Jerr. 27.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE is the <HI>Knowledge and Wis∣dom</HI> of GOD display'd in the Works of Creation. This is legible in the whole Frame of the <HI>Universe.</HI> Prov. 3.19, 20. <HI>The LORD by Wisdom bath frounded the Earth, by Understanding bath be esta∣blished the Heavens, by his Knowledge the Depths were broken up.</HI> Every Creature bears the <HI>Sig∣natures</HI> of manifold Wisdom. Psal. 104.24. <HI>O LORD, how manifold are thy Works! in Wisdom thou hast made them all.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT Beauty, Variety and Harmony is there in <HI>each</HI> distinctly, and in <HI>all</HI> conjunctly? What <HI>Art</HI> in their Composition, and what wise <HI>Design</HI> in their Uses, Subordinations, and mutual Services? <HI>The World by Wisdom know not GOD;</HI> to its re∣proach be it spoken, for it might easily and should have surely done so by the infinite Variety and Depths of Wisdom in the Works of Nature.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Understandings</HI> serve to the <HI>Contemplation</HI> of the divine Wisdom, in the Form, Order, Mo∣tions and Creatures of the Universe, and when we see a little into these Things we are lost in Admiration. <HI>Wisdom and Strength are his, he is mighty in Strength and Wisdom,</HI> Job 36.5.</P>
<P>HOW soon are the truly <HI>knowing and wise</HI> con∣vinced of their own <HI>Ignorance?</HI> How soon do they confess with <HI>Amazement</HI> that they know nothing at all! that they are lost in their Searches into the least Creature? The <HI>brutish Person</HI> knows not,
<PB N="47" REF="004489_0054_100D57B7CDBE8630"/>neither does the <HI>Fool</HI> understand this: He <HI>over∣looks</HI> the admirable Effects of divine Wisdom that encompasses him on every Side, in a wretched <HI>Carelessness</HI> and <HI>sottish</HI> Inconsideration! Whereas would Men but open their Eyes and see, would they give their Minds to contemplate GOD in his Works, would they use their Reason and survey the same Things that daily occur to them; wou'd they but seriously set themselves to think of what they behold every Day with their Eyes; the Wisdom of GOD would necesarily appear <HI>ravish∣ing</HI> to their Minds, and in its <HI>exquisite Beauty</HI> captivate their Souls.</P>
<P>BUT at last put all together that has ever been <HI>seen</HI> or <HI>said,</HI> by philosophical and devout <HI>Persons,</HI> the <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Religious</HI> of all Ages, concern∣ing the Wisdom of the Creation, and it infinitely falls short of the Truth of the <HI>glorious Subject.</HI> After all we must say of it, as the <HI>wise Queen of Sheba</HI> did to <HI>Solomon</HI> when she had seen his <HI>Works,</HI> and heard his <HI>Wisdom; not Half has been told us,</HI> nor ever can be. That <HI>Queen of the South</HI> felt her <HI>Spirit fail</HI> her, and there was no more <HI>Strength</HI> left in her, when she did but behold the Art and Elegance of <HI>Solomon's Architecture,</HI> and the Ascent by which he went up to the House of the LORD: But behold, a <HI>greater than Solomon is here,</HI> and how much greater a <HI>Fabrick</HI> than his <HI>Temple!</HI> The <HI>Builder and Maker of it is GOD,</HI> and un∣searchable is the Wisdom in the Design and Fi∣nishing hereof. Job 11.5. <HI>O that God would speak, and open his Lips unto thee, and that he would shew thee the Secrets of Wisdom; that they are doable to that which is!</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="48" REF="004489_0055_100D57B98C338518"/>
3. UNSEARCHABLE is the <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD that appears in the Works of Creation. All <HI>Be∣ings</HI> flow'd from the meer Good-Will and Boun∣ty of the <HI>first Cause,</HI> who <HI>only is good.</HI> "He was eternally possess'd of infinite Felicity in himself, and had no need of the Existence of any thing. He created the reasonable Creature to communi∣cate of Blessedness unto them. He design'd infi∣nete Communications of Good unto them, when he stampt his Image on them. He knew himself to be eno' to make 'em everlastingly happy, and therefore he created them. He stor'd the Earth with an unsearchable Variety of Bounties and Delights, and then he brought forth Man upon it. As are our Desires, Wishes, Hopes, and far beyond the Conceptions of any Creatures, so is the Goodness of GOD. He has endow'd us so <HI>richly</HI> that he may replenish and fill us.</P>
<P>LOOK thro' the visible Creation, and see the Provision made thro'our it all for the Entertain∣ment of Man, his Soul and Body! Immense Stores from the divine Fulness and Munificence! What Wonders of Wisdom for our muring <HI>Minds?</HI> What Beauties for our gozing <HI>Fyes?</HI> What pleasing Sounds for our <HI>Ears?</HI> What De∣licacy of Food for our <HI>Palates?</HI> What a <HI>Para∣dise</HI> the Earth—if by our Sins we had not blasted it? and <HI>GOD Himself</HI> for our Souls if we had not <HI>apostatiz'd</HI> and cut our selves off from Him?</P>
<P><HI>GOODNESS</HI> form'd our Body for the Soul, and <HI>Goodness</HI> breath'd the heaven-born Spirit into the Body. <HI>Goodness</HI> furnish'd the World for our
<PB N="33" REF="004489_0056_100D57BBEDEF9520"/>Sustenance, and <HI>Goodness</HI> made us for GOD and Immortality. <HI>Goodness</HI> made all Things very Good, and fills them with their proper Good of every Kind, and in every Measure. But who can trace the <HI>eternal Spring</HI> of the divine Munificence, thro' every <HI>Stream</HI> of it? We know not how to speak of it suitably and adore it. He is the <HI>One GOD and Father of all, who is above all, and thro' all, and in all.</HI></P>
<P>USE 1. <HI>See the Use and End of all the Crea∣tures, of one part of the Creation of GOD and ano∣ther;</HI> Namely, to shew forth the <HI>Greatness, the unsearchable Gratness of the</HI> CREATOR. The <HI>Universe</HI> can have no greater <HI>Design,</HI> nor any more worthy <HI>Use</HI> than this. Rev. 4.11. <HI>Thou art worthy, O LORD, to receive Glory and Honour and Power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy Pleasure they are and were created.</HI> What other <HI>Reason</HI> or <HI>Motive</HI> could there be for the creating any thing? Surely GOD has made all things <HI>for Himself. Of him, and thro' him, and to him are all things.</HI> All Creatures look to GOD, and lead us to him, and speak to us of him, and call upon us to glorify him. The Heavens de∣clare his Glory, and the Firmament sheweth his Handy-Work: Day unto Day uttereth speech, and Night unto Night sheweth Knowledge: There is no speech nor Language where their Voice is not heard. The <HI>Creation</HI> in all its Parts unite in that <HI>Acclamation,</HI> and in a manner an∣swer and fulfil that <HI>Vision,</HI> Rev. 19.6. <HI>And I heard as it were the Voice of a great Multitude, and as the Voice of many Waters, and as the Voice
<PB N="40" REF="004489_0057_100D57C04C81C840"/>of mighty Thunderings, saying, Alleluia, for the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>highest</HI> Creatures can have no higher End than this, to serve unto the <HI>Creator's Glory:</HI> and the <HI>leust</HI> of Creatures can have no less an End, and in their Places do as truly serve thereunto as the best and greatest. <HI>Man</HI>'s chief End is to glo∣rify GOD, and the End of any <HI>Worm</HI> or <HI>Insect</HI> is his Glory also: only the <HI>one</HI> is to serve hereunto in a free and <HI>active</HI> Way, the <HI>other</HI> in a more <HI>passive;</HI> the one is to <HI>give</HI> GOD the Glory of the other Isai. 43.20, 21. <HI>The Beasts of the Field shall honour me, the Dragons and the Owls:— this People also have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my Paraise.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. LET us infer <HI>the Duty of the raitional Crea∣ture,</HI> resulting from the visible Creation, to <HI>con∣template GOD in his Works,</HI> and to give him <HI>Ado∣rations</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> on account of them. The rational Mind, the Eyes and Tongues of Men were certainly made for this. At the Formation of the Earth <HI>the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of GOD shouted</HI> the Praises of the CREATOR. The <HI>stupid Mass,</HI> out of which our Bodies were formed, and the Creatures brought forth, could not praise him: but <HI>Angels</HI> beheld these Worlds of ours come into Being, and then into Order, and gave him the Glory due unto his Name. So neither can the <HI>World that now is,</HI> the Earth and Sea, with the <HI>dumb</HI> Creatures in them, know and laud the <HI>Creator;</HI> but <HI>We</HI> have Understanding and Speech to do it for them and from them, and from us the Almighty expects
<PB N="51" REF="004489_0058_100D57C1D3340BD0"/>the Tribute. The <HI>Heathen Poet</HI> this and said, <HI>Os Homini sublime dedit,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Creator</HI> gave to Man this Face and Eye, that he should behold the Heavens, and look thro' the spacious Worlds, and give the <HI>Maker</HI> of them Glory. And this Date of <HI>Contemplation,</HI> and consequent Admiration and <HI>Worship</HI> is abundantly pressed on us in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> A Duty which Man∣kind are sadly <HI>wanting</HI> in, tho' why has GOD made us <HI>wiser</HI> than the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the Field, and than the <HI>Fowls</HI> of Heaven, but for this! Why are the Beasts <HI>dumb,</HI> and we <HI>speak?</HI> Why look they <HI>down,</HI> and we <HI>up</HI> and <HI>abroad</HI> thro' the <HI>Uni∣verse?</HI> Sorely 'tis to <HI>see</HI> GOD in his Works, and <HI>adore</HI> his Greatness in them. We ought fre∣quently to consider with <HI>David,</HI> GOD's <HI>Heavens, the Work of his Fingers, the Moon and the Stars</HI> which he has created; and while we do so we ought to be making our devotional Reflections on the Greatness, Glory, Wisdom, Goodness and Power of the great CREATOR. <HI>The Works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have Pleasure therein. I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole Heart, I will show forth all thy marvellows Works. Among the Gods there are none like unto thee, O LORD, neither any Works like unto thy Works: All Nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O LORD, and shall glorify the Name: for thou art Great, and doest wondrous Things, thou art GOD alone.</HI> Thus ought the <HI>great GOD</HI> to be greatly reverenc'd and honoured by his <HI>reasonable Creatures.</HI> And indeed the very <HI>Heathens</HI> are left <HI>inexcusable</HI> in their <HI>Idolatries</HI> and gross <HI>Immoralities,</HI> from what GOD has shewn us of his <HI>Greatness and Glory</HI> in
<PB N="52" REF="004489_0059_100D57C3AE5FA0B8"/>his <HI>Works.</HI> Excellent is the Strain of Argument and Reasoning to this purpose in the first <HI>Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans.</HI> No Man that will use his Senses, and observe the Heavens and the Earth, can without forfeiting his Reason, and the highest Contradiction to it, worship a <HI>Stock and Stone,</HI> or the Image of Heaven; for if he will but think he must easily know that all these things have some glorious <HI>Maker,</HI> whose Creature he himself is also, and <HI>whom</HI> only he must therefore Worship If a <HI>Heathen</HI> will not thus use his Reason, he <HI>despises his Maker,</HI> and dishonours and abuses his own Nature: or if he <HI>violates</HI> his Understand∣ing and Conscience, lives like a <HI>Brute</HI> or worships a brutal <HI>Form,</HI> he does despight unto GOD and is guilty before him as truly, tho' not so heinously, as we <HI>Christians</HI> are if we perish under the <HI>writ∣ten Law.</HI> The Law of <HI>Nature</HI> is a very <HI>sacred</HI> Law, and the Light of Nature a very <HI>great Light:</HI> to <HI>live up</HI> to it is a very great Thing; and to <HI>quench</HI> it by Lust, or wilfully to Sin against it is a very <HI>high Guilt.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3, and lastly, <HI>NONE</HI> of the Creatures of GOD are in themselves <HI>vile or diminutive;</HI> but how <HI>little</HI> a Creature is <HI>Man</HI> in the Universe and be∣fore his MAKER? We cannot lightly esteem the <HI>least</HI> Creature, nor may we vilify any one, be∣cause the least and meanest are unsearchable. All are admirable: Much of GOD, his Wisdom, Power, Goodness and Dominion is to be seen in each, and in all of them. GOD who knows his own Work treats them all with a Regard. Not a <HI>Sparrow</HI> misses it, and even the <HI>Hairs</HI> of our
<PB N="53" REF="004489_0060_100D57C534B8F2C0"/>Heads are numbred by him. He has given <HI>Man</HI> the <HI>Dominion</HI> over and <HI>Use</HI> of the inferior Crea∣tures, and put them under our <HI>Feet;</HI> but it be∣comes us not to <HI>trample,</HI> either in Pride or Care∣lessness, on a very <HI>Worm;</HI> which as no Man can form, nor eno' admire the Formation of, so the <HI>great GOD</HI> that made it feeds it and cares for it. We should look upon every Creature we use with <HI>Wonder,</HI> and while for our Necessities and Conveniences, Comfort and Delight, GOD hath subjected them to us, let us neither needlesly ra∣vage and destroy them, nor abuse them to Wan∣tonness and Lust. Let the Work of GOD be al∣ways honourable and glorious to us; and as GOD has put the Honour of a <HI>superior Nature</HI> on us, crowning us with his own <HI>Image and Likeness;</HI> so let us <HI>reverence our selves</HI> and debase neither Soul nor Body from those rational and religious Servi∣ces, which the LORD our GOD has design'd us for.</P>
<P>BUT at the same time, in the midst of this vast Creation, <HI>LORD, what is Man!</HI> What Reasons for <HI>Humiliation</HI> and Abasement in our own Eyes may we fetch from the Unsearchableness of GOD in his Works? How <HI>little</HI> is it that any single Person <HI>possesses</HI> of this vast Creation? The <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> of the Earth parcel it out among themselves, but what have they at last to be proud of? Like some <HI>Master-Ant</HI> upon his <HI>Hillock,</HI> com∣pared to the wide Extent of the Creation round about them! What have the richest Mortals to cast into the Treasury of the GOD of Nature, but a <HI>Widow's Mite.</HI> How soon must Man be dispos∣sess'd of his Earth, and return to his <HI>Dust?</HI> And
<PB N="54" REF="004489_0061_100D57C6F606B810"/>when he's <HI>gone,</HI> the Earth <HI>misses</HI> him not, the World keeps on its Course, as if he never had been.</P>
<P>AGAIN, HOW <HI>little</HI> can Man <HI>command</HI> of the Things he sees and is conversant with? Will the <HI>Winds</HI> and <HI>Seas</HI> obey him? Can he lift up his Voice to the <HI>Clouds,</HI> that abundance of Waters should cover him? Hast thou commanded the <HI>Morning</HI> since thy Day? Or shall the Earth be removed out of its Place <HI>for thee?</HI></P>
<P>TO have done, How <HI>little</HI> is Mans <HI>Knowledge</HI> after he has search'd into the vast Works of GOD! What seems he then to himself but Ignorance and Darkness! <HI>even as a Beast before GOD!</HI> He that's <HI>Half-learned</HI> may Conceit that he knows a great deal, and they that are truly <HI>Learned</HI> among Men do so compared with their unread or tho't∣less Nei'bours; but he that <HI>knows most</HI> here below sees most his own Defects and <HI>Incapacity,</HI> and the unsearchable Riches of Knowledge, which he cannot now attain unto. <HI>We are of Yesterday, and know nothing.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING in some <HI>little</HI> Manner medita∣ted the <HI>unsearchable Greatness</HI> of GOD in his Works of <HI>Creation,</HI> I pass on now to the <HI>second Instance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>GOD's Works of Providence.</HI></P>
<P>THAT there is a glorious <HI>Providence</HI> exercised over all things, whereby in all their Motions and Actions all Creatures are upheld and govern'd, in a most holy wise and powerful Manner, is one of the <HI>first Doctrines of natural Religion.</HI> As sure as the <HI>Being</HI> of a GOD, and the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World, so sure is the Doctrine of his <HI>Providence.</HI> If GOD <HI>created</HI> it, he must <HI>uphold</HI> it. The Pre∣servation of Things in their beautiful and useful Order requires the same Power and Wisdom which gave them their Being and Use. If GOD made
<PB N="56" REF="004489_0063_100D57CCB9BF0CF0"/>the World it can neither be <HI>below</HI> him, nor <HI>diffi∣cult</HI> to him to govern it: Nay, it must be neces∣sary to his <HI>Glory,</HI> and part of his <HI>Felicity</HI> to do so. Can it be his <HI>Dishonour</HI> to be the <HI>Governor of the Universe?</HI> the LORD over all, in the actual Exer∣cise of <HI>Rule?</HI> or can it be a <HI>Burthen</HI> to the <HI>infinite Mind,</HI> to the <HI>almighty Word,</HI> to which all Things are alike <HI>easy?</HI> A <HI>Million</HI> as <HI>One!</HI> and the <HI>Great∣est</HI> as the <HI>Least!</HI></P>
<P>IN short, I shall now take it for granted that there is an all-disposing <HI>Providence,</HI> and thereup∣on I have only to say—<HI>How unsearchable the Greatness of GOD is appearing in it!</HI> in the <HI>Order, Sustentation</HI> and <HI>Disposition</HI> of every thing which we behold.</P>
<P>IN general: How unsearchable is the <HI>Univer∣sality</HI> of a Providence! A <HI>sufficient</HI> Care had to <HI>all</HI> Things, infinitely <HI>various,</HI> however <HI>distant,</HI> however <HI>opposite</HI> in their Nature; at the <HI>same</HI> Time, for <HI>Ever-more,</HI> and with infinite <HI>Ease!</HI> What a <HI>glorious Mind</HI> is it that does this! Every <HI>Species</HI> and <HI>Kind</HI> preserv'd, and in all their <HI>Indi∣viduals</HI> supply'd, in their constant <HI>Succession,</HI> from the Beginning of the World unto this Day! and all over-rul'd and directed to the wisest and best <HI>Ends,</HI> by his sovereign Influence and Will! So that in the infinite Variety and Contrariety of Creatures, they are all made together to serve unto the <HI>general Good</HI> of the Universe, the <HI>mutual Benefit</HI> of one another, and the <HI>high Glory</HI> of the CREATOR ultimately. Here is perfect <HI>Order</HI> in seeming wild Confusions, and perfect <HI>Harmony</HI> in all present seeming Discords and Jarrings.
<PB N="57" REF="004489_0064_100D57CE57A0D400"/>But the mean while it is perfect <HI>Mystery</HI> and an unsearchable Conduct. Eccl. 3 11. <HI>He has made every Thing beautiful in his Time, also he hath set the World in their Heart,</HI> ("given a whole World of Matter for the Hearts of Men copious∣ly to meditate on) <HI>yet so that no Man can find out the Work that GOD maketh from the Beginning to the End.</HI></P>

What a <HI>migh∣ty Being</HI> is HE, who has assign'd to <HI>these</HI> their <HI>Distances, Places, Motions, Center, Magnetism,</HI> and they inviolably obey the <HI>Law</HI> he gave them for Ever-more, in their exact <HI>Revolutions.</HI> If the great GOD did not govern <HI>these</HI> in our Favour, how soon wou'd the Earth <HI>sink</HI> under us, and the <HI>Pit open</HI> and swallow us quick; or the Sea <HI>drown</HI> us! If the <HI>Sun</HI> should roll near to us it would soon <HI>scorch</HI> us to Death; or if the <HI>Earth</HI> should roll further from it we should be as soon <HI>frozen</HI> stiff with Cold: if the <HI>Moon</HI> should leave us and
<PB N="58" REF="004489_0065_100D57D1419E8530"/>wander away, the <HI>stagnated Sea</HI> would soon <HI>poison</HI> us; or if it should roll on nearer to us 'twould raise the <HI>Tides</HI> so high that they would run over our Houses. Now how great is that <HI>Providence</HI> which keeps these <HI>vast Bodies</HI> in their Places, and makes 'em so kindly minister to one another thro' every Generation? So that <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night, Sum∣mer</HI> and <HI>Winter; Tides, Dews</HI> and <HI>Rains</HI> do not fail us; but <HI>vital Heat and Moisture and Respira∣tion</HI> is provided for and preserved unto us and all the living Creatures!</P>
<P>BUT to keep to our own <HI>Limits</HI> a little more,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the <HI>unsearchable Power</HI> of GOD that commands the <HI>Winds,</HI> and infinite is the <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> which orders that mild or wild <HI>Ele∣ment</HI> the <HI>Air.</HI> How thin, and light, and soft and yielding an Element in its <HI>Calm?</HI> how strong, and fierce, and raging, spreading wide Desolations, when GOD bids it storm? How much is the World govern'd by the Ministrations thereof? GOD uses it, raises and stills it as he please. <HI>His Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Dust of his Feet! His Fury is pour'd out like Fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by him.</HI> He <HI>gathers</HI> the Wind in his <HI>Hand,</HI> and when he lets them <HI>sly,</HI> how do they <HI>roar and tear?</HI> Di∣vine Majesty and Wrath rides upon its Wings; the Earth shakes and the Hills move under its Force and Weight; <HI>A Smoke goes out of his No∣strils, and Fire out of his Mouth devours; Dark∣ness is under his Feet, and at his Brightness the thick Cloud passes, Hail-Stones and Coals of Fine.</HI> Psal. 18.10, 12.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="004489_0066_100D57D367D39A38"/>
THUS GOD looks to the Ends of the Earth, and seeth under the whole Heavens, to make the Weight for the Winds, and to weigh the Wa∣ters by Measure; to give Decrees to the Rain, and to make a Way for the Lightning and Thun∣der; he sees it and declares it, he prepares it and searches it out; which none beside him can do. He causeth it to come whether for Correction or Mercy. Now out of the <HI>South</HI> comes the <HI>Whirl∣wind,</HI> and <HI>Cold</HI> out of the <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Frost</HI> is the Breath of GOD: Presently again he <HI>quieteth</HI> is the Earth by the same <HI>South Wind,</HI> and we know not how our <HI>Garments grow warm</HI> upon us. Now he <HI>persecutes</HI> a guilty World by his Tempests, and makes them afraid by his Storm; again he merci∣fully <HI>fanns</HI> and <HI>purges</HI> the Air for us, by bring∣ing the Winds out of his <HI>Treasures,</HI> and the pleas'd <HI>Mariners</HI> improve the welcome <HI>Gale,</HI> the <HI>Ships</HI> stagger under their Courses, and are driven with their rich <HI>Freight</HI> to their <HI>Port.</HI> Thus the Great∣ness and Goodness of GOD is seen in the <HI>blowing</HI> of the Wind.</P>
<P N="2">2. No less is it in the <HI>Ruling and Ordering of the Sea:</HI> in commanding the <HI>Waters,</HI> the vast <HI>Deep</HI> and <HI>Abyss</HI> wherein our Earth seems to <HI>float,</HI> and with which it is <HI>wash'd,</HI> by which it is also in a great Measure <HI>stock'd</HI> and <HI>enrich'd.</HI> The Crea∣tures <HI>in</HI> it, and the Dwellers <HI>upon</HI> it, are beyond Number; and what a mighty Providence is it that watcheth over them all! There <HI>go the Ships,</HI> and there <HI>plays Leviathan!</HI> Let us look and <HI>dive</HI> a little into this <HI>wide and great Sea,</HI> wherein are Things creeping <HI>innumerable,</HI> both small and great Beasts, which do all wait upon GOD, as
<PB N="60" REF="004489_0067_100D57D543D55A90"/>much as the Creatures on the <HI>Land</HI> do, and he gives them their Meat in due Season, they are filled with Good, <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.25, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the same time <HI>Men</HI> go down to this <HI>Sea</HI> in Ships, do∣ing <HI>Business</HI> on these <HI>mighty Waters;</HI> they see the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD and his <HI>Wonders</HI> on the Deep: Sometimes to their Terror and great Danger he commandeth and raiseth the <HI>stormy Wind,</HI> which lifteth up the Waves; they <HI>mount</HI> up to the Hea∣vens, they <HI>go down</HI> again to the Depths, their Souls <HI>melt</HI> for Trouble, they <HI>reel</HI> to and fro, they <HI>stag∣ger</HI> like drunken Men, and are at their Wits end: then they <HI>cry</HI> unto the LORD in their Trou∣ble (to <HI>Him</HI> that made the Sea and rules it, and is the <HI>Confidence</HI> of all that are afar off upon it) they cry to him as from the <HI>Belly of Hell,</HI> and he bring∣eth them out of their <HI>Distresses:</HI> He maketh the Storm a Calm, the Waves are still, the <HI>Mariners</HI> Hearts at ease and glad, so he bringeth them un∣to their <HI>desir'd Haven, Psal.</HI> 107.23. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>what Manner of Word</HI> and Rule is this, which e∣ven the <HI>Winds and Seas obey?</HI> The <HI>eternal Word</HI> as it were <HI>awaked</HI> in the <HI>Storm</HI> and rebuking it: saying—<HI>Peace be still—and there is a great Calm!</HI> O that Men would <HI>praise</HI> the LORD for his Greatness, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men! Let them <HI>exalt</HI> him also in the <HI>Congregation</HI> of the People, and praise him in the <HI>Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Elders.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is no small part of the divine Dominion, <HI>from Sea to Sea.</HI> His <HI>Way</HI> is in the Sea, &amp; his <HI>Paths</HI> in the great Waters, and his <HI>Footsteps are not know,</HI> Psal. 77.19. He rules the <HI>raging</HI> of it, when the Waves arise he <HI>stilleth</HI> them: O who is
<PB N="61" REF="004489_0068_100D57D815C2A5F0"/>a <HI>strong</HI> LORD like unto him, or to his <HI>Faithful∣ness</HI> round about him! <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.8, 9. The <HI>Floods</HI> may lift up their <HI>Voice</HI> and their Waves, but the LORD on high is mightier than the <HI>Noise</HI> of many Waters, yea than the <HI>mighty Waves</HI> of the Sea.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>dry Land,</HI> our <HI>habitable Earth,</HI> is un∣der a most wonderful, wise, gracious and power∣ful Preservation and Government. How is it <HI>stock'd</HI> with Creatures, and not a Species lost! How is it <HI>cloath'd</HI> with <HI>Grass,</HI> and cover'd with <HI>Corn,</HI> and water'd with <HI>Springs</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> which run in the <HI>Valleys,</HI> yea ascend up into the <HI>Hills!</HI> What a rich <HI>yearly Provision</HI> is made for the li∣ving Creatures, and in them for us? What rich and vast Stores of <HI>Vapours</HI> are daily ascendings, and by Night descending in <HI>Dews</HI> on us? Why does not the Earth <HI>sink</HI> in the vast Abyss, how does it <HI>swim</HI> so <HI>even</HI> in it, and so <HI>safely</HI> in the stormy Day? Or rather what Power <HI>restrains</HI> the foaming Waters in its spacious <HI>Womb?</HI> What saves us from desolating <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and who is it that now and then creates that <HI>new</HI> and rare <HI>thing;</HI> when the Earth opens its Mouth and swal∣lows up <HI>Cities;</HI> Multitudes go down together quick and <HI>alive into the Pit. "He removeth the Mountains at his Pleasure, and they know it not, he overturneth them in his Anger; he shaketh the Earth our her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble,</HI> Job 9.5, 6. But the <HI>ordinary Course</HI> of his Providence is <HI>gracicus</HI> and bountiful, a <HI>tender Car:</HI> and Mercy to us: "<HI>By his Strongth he set∣teth fast the Mountains, being girded with Power; be makes the Morning and Evening to rejoice; he
<PB N="62" REF="004489_0069_100D57DB977A1220"/>visits the Earth and waters it and greatly inriches it; he blesses the springing thereof, and crowns the Year with his Goodness; the Pastures are cloathed with Flocks, and the Valleys are laden with Corn.</HI> Thus the Earth is full of the <HI>Riches</HI> of divine Bounty, and satisfied with the Fruit of his Works.</P>
<P>AND thus I have in the <HI>Phrase of Scripture</HI> meditated the divine <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> respecting the greater Parts of the <HI>Creation;</HI> the <HI>Orbs</HI> and <HI>Globes</HI> we see in <HI>our</HI> World, and parti∣cularly our own <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE is the Work of Provi∣dence <HI>in the Supply and Government of the living Creatures in all these:</HI> which are mighty <HI>Hosts</HI> for number, of every <HI>Kind;</HI> yet GOD <HI>feeds</HI> them all, lays in a daily Provision for them, and by <HI>Instinct</HI> guides them to provide for themselves, both as to <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Sustenance.</HI> He giveth to the <HI>Beast</HI> his Food, and to the <HI>Ravens</HI> which cry to him: the young <HI>Lions</HI> seek their Meat of him while they roar after the Prey: and the Shoals of <HI>Fish</HI> in the Sea, both the <HI>small and great</HI> there, wait on him to <HI>gather</HI> what he <HI>scatters</HI> among them with a full Hand.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there any Creature so <HI>vast</HI> but GOD rules it; none so strong as to be Masterless. Tho' the <HI>Bones of Behemoth</HI> be as pieces of <HI>Brass,</HI> and as Bars of <HI>Iron</HI> (one of the Chief of the Works of GOD) yet he that made him, can make his <HI>Sword</HI> to enter into him: tho' the huge Creature drinketh up a <HI>River,</HI> and trusteth that he can draw up <HI>Jordan</HI> into his Mouth; yet Providence
<PB N="63" REF="004489_0070_100D57DD1C8F5338"/><HI>fills</HI> him with Grass, and finds him drink end for his mighty <HI>Thirst.</HI> Again, the <HI>Leviathan</HI> that huge and fearless King of the Sea obeys and <HI>reve∣rently ministers</HI> at the command of GOD: for in∣stance, when <HI>Jonah</HI> (the LORD's Prophet) was cast into the Sea, and the <HI>Whale</HI> carefully took the Charge of him, and hid him in a Corner of its spacious <HI>Jaw,</HI> that the Sea should not <HI>suffocate</HI> him, nor would the Monster <HI>devour</HI> him himself: only to show <HI>Jonah</HI> the Greatness of GOD who had sent him, down he <HI>flounc'd</HI> with him to the Bottom of the Mountains, and <HI>sported</HI> with him as his <HI>Prey;</HI> while <HI>Jonah</HI> pray'd and cry'd, as out of the Belly of Hell, to the GOD of Heaven; and the LORD spake unto the <HI>Fish,</HI> and he rose and <HI>vomited him out upon the dry Land.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Crocodile</HI> I think is the Creature mount by <HI>Leviathan.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>ALMIGHTY Providence easily commands the dumb Creature, and they <HI>forget</HI> their Instinct, and go <HI>against their Nature.</HI> Voracious <HI>Ravens</HI> are made to feed <HI>Elijah</HI> at one time, and <HI>Angels</HI> them∣selves do it at another. The <HI>Fish</HI> croud into the <HI>Net</HI> at the Call of <HI>Christ,</HI> as proud which should first obey and feast their <HI>Maker,</HI> and declare his Glory to the <HI>dull</HI> Sons of Men. The hungry <HI>Lions</HI> show reverence to his <HI>Prophet,</HI> while they <HI>pant</HI> for the Blood of his Enemies. The <HI>Lion</HI> slew the <HI>disobedient Prophet</HI> at GOD's Word, but to shew that it was meerly and <HI>Act of Obedience,</HI> and not of his savage Nature, he stood by the <HI>Carcase</HI> and by the <HI>Ass</HI> &amp; touched neither of 'em any more:
<PB N="64" REF="004489_0071_100D57DEA3332B60"/>as <HI>tame</HI> now after the Execution as a <HI>Home-Ma∣stiff:</HI> Nay, the <HI>Passengers</HI> go by him safe and he stirs not after them: nor yet touched he the <HI>old Prophet</HI> himself, when he came to bring away the Body of his Brother; a <HI>Boldness</HI> in the <HI>wretched Man</HI> which I can scarce think how to account for! For how cou'd he look on the <HI>Corps</HI> but as the <HI>Ghost</HI> of him whom his <HI>Lies</HI> had murder'd? And how could he see the <HI>Lion</HI> and not fear himself to be his next Morsel? Yet did not the Beast, the Minister of the divine Justice that Day, harm him at all, not having the Commission from GOD.</P>
<P>To name no more: When the <HI>Philistines</HI> weary of the <HI>Ark</HI> had put it in a <HI>New Cart,</HI> and their <HI>Sin-offering</HI> with it, to be drawn by two <HI>Milch-kine</HI> that had never before been <HI>yok'd,</HI> put∣ting all the <HI>late Dispensations</HI> of Providence to∣ward them upon this Issue: 1 Sam. 6.9. <HI>If it goeth up by the Way of its own Course,</HI> (i e. in the <HI>Road</HI> and streight <HI>Highway</HI> toward the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> a Road that the Creatures had never gone, nor indeed had they ever drawn at all in a Yoke) <HI>then hath the GOD of Israel done us this great Evil; but if not, then shall we know that it was not his Hand that smote us, but it was a Chance that hapned to us.</HI> Providence <HI>agreed</HI> and join'd <HI>Issue</HI> on the <HI>Event,</HI> and both the <HI>Philistines</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> saw the Glory of JEHOVAH, the only true and living GOD. For immediately the <HI>Kine</HI> took the streight Way to <HI>Bethshemesh,</HI> the next Bor∣der of <HI>Israel, lowing</HI> as they went, (<HI>scil.</HI> after their <HI>Calves</HI> which they left behind, yet con∣strained to go on by an invisible Power againft the strong <HI>Inclinations</HI> of Nature) they turn'd
<PB N="65" REF="004489_0072_100D57E02E8F6F00"/>not aside to the right Hand nor to the left; and the <HI>Lords of the Philistines</HI> went gazing and won∣dring after them; <HI>convinc'd</HI> by the dumb Beasts, but not <HI>converted.</HI></P>
<P>NOW what an unsearchable Government is this over the living Creatures and <HI>brute Animals,</HI> besides their usual abundant Services to Man. But to pass from the <HI>greater Things and Creatures;</HI> unto <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Intelligences</HI> created.</P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Providence of GOD in its Government of <HI>intelligent and rational Crea∣tures:</HI> whether in Heaven, Earth or Hell; An∣gels, Men and Devils.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>boly Angels</HI> and their <HI>high Orders,</HI> we know by Revelation that they are a <HI>noble Part</HI> of GOD's Dominion. We read of their ready Obedience, Subjection and Ministrations. "<HI>They excel in Strength, and do his Command∣ments, hearkning unto the Voice of his Word: Are they not ministring Spirits, sent forth?</HI> And do they not gladly <HI>come,</HI> pleas'd in the lowest Ser∣vices to Men? They humbly own themselves the <HI>Fellow-Servants</HI> of Prophets and holy Saints. They worship and adore GOD the CREATOR, and the <HI>Lamb</HI> our SAVIOUR with more Abase∣ment, as well as Fervour and Delight, than we on Earth can attain unto. They <HI>cover their Faces,</HI> tho' so bright, and cry—<HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD of Hosts! the whole Earth is full of thy Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="004489_0073_100D57E25AF86758"/>
AT the same time these <HI>Thrones</HI> and <HI>Dominions</HI> in the Heavens are such <HI>high and potent Beings,</HI> that the Empire over a few of these we may think more glorious to the CREATOR, than the Subjec∣tion of all the Nations of the Earth. They seem, some of them, to have a <HI>Presidency</HI> as <HI>Princes</HI> o∣ver the <HI>Empires</HI> here below; but however that be, we know them to be so mighty Beings, that a <HI>single One,</HI> by the divine Commission, could slay <HI>Nations</HI> in a Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>DEVILS</HI> that fell from Heaven, yet have not made their <HI>Escape</HI> from the divine Dominion and Government. When some of the <HI>Hosts</HI> of Angels revolted from GOD, how easily were they cast down to Hell? And shall be shut up there for ever in a Pit and <HI>Prison,</HI> together with the weaker wretched <HI>Ghosts</HI> of ungodly Men. This <HI>infernal</HI> Prison shews the Greatness and Dominion of Providence, as well as the <HI>Palace</HI> of Heaven: Here the Triumphs of <HI>Grace,</HI> and there those of <HI>Justice.</HI> Read the Power of GOD over <HI>Devils:</HI> Rev. 20.1, 2. <HI>And I saw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bottomless Pit, and a great Chain in his Hand; and he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent the Devil and Satan, and bound him—, and cast him into the Pit, and shut him up, and set a Scal upon him.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED <HI>evil Spirits</HI> have a <HI>Range</HI> permitted to them, and are <HI>us'd</HI> too by Providence in <HI>judi∣cial Executions,</HI> as in <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Seduction, and <HI>Judas</HI> his tragical End. But they are under <HI>Restraints,</HI> and <HI>Frustrations;</HI> are limited, and over-rul'd to good, as well as wicked Men. The Devil could
<PB N="67" REF="004489_0074_100D57E499B24EE0"/>not touch <HI>Job</HI> nor his Substance till GOD suffer'd him: nor enter into the Herd of <HI>Swine</HI> without our SAVIOUR's Permission; at whose Sight he trembled also and lay groveling in Torment. In their malicious Desires and Designs against GOD and our Souls, they are often made Instrumental to the Salvation of Souls; as eminently in the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> of our <HI>Saviour.</HI> It is the Greatness and Glory of GOD to have these <HI>"Slaves at the "Oar,</HI> while Providence <HI>steers</HI> the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. GREAT is the Providence of GOD in the Government of <HI>Mankind. In his Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the Breath of all Mankind,</HI> Job 12.9. <HI>He ruleth by his Power for ever, his Eyes behold the Nations,</HI> Psal 66.7. Let us here contemplate:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Greatness of Providence in the Disposal and Government of the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of the Earth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of every <HI>individual Person.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. THE Greatness of Providence is illustrious in its Government of <HI>Nations, Kingdoms and Pro∣vinces.</HI> By GOD <HI>Kings rule and Princes decree Justice;</HI> yea, even the inferior <HI>Judges</HI> of the Earth are ordained by him. He setteth up Kings and removeth them, he exalts and abases them; he enlarges the Nations and diminishes them again. <HI>GOD is the King of all the Earth: GOD reigneth over the Heathen; GOD sitteth upon the Throne of his Holiness: the Shields of the Earth belong un∣to GOD; he is greatly exalted,</HI> Psal. 47.9.</P>
<P>HE has ordained <HI>Government</HI> for the Good of the World. He permits <HI>Tyrants</HI> for a Scourge
<PB N="68" REF="004489_0075_100D57E7E6340B68"/>and Punishment of it. He uses the <HI>Powers</HI> on Earth to serve his Church and Truth, when they know it not nor mean it. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was his <HI>Shepherd,</HI> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> was his <HI>Rod. Daniel's four Beasts</HI> in their rice, ravages and final Destruction, were each under the strict notice of Providence: and so is the <HI>little Horn,</HI> which yet keeps boasting of its Power from Heaven, to bind <HI>Kings</HI> themselves and the <HI>Consciences</HI> of their People.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE <HI>restrains</HI> the proud Powers on Earth, and takes its time to <HI>punish</HI> them. It decks it self now with <HI>Majesty and Excellency,</HI> and ar∣rays it self with <HI>Glory and Beauty:</HI> It casts abroad the <HI>Rage</HI> of its Wrath, and beholds every one that is proud to <HI>abase</HI> him. It treads down the wicked in the Dust; and it is gloriously seen that the <HI>Most High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,</HI> and giveth them to whomsoever he will.</P>
<P>AGAIN, He giveth <HI>Salvation unto Kings;</HI> takes their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> under a more special Care and Guard, and their <HI>Counsels</HI> under a special gra∣cious Influence. He <HI>turns</HI> their Hearts, which are <HI>deep,</HI> as the <HI>Rivers</HI> of Waters, and by spiri∣ting or dispiriting, infatuating or directing them, be brings about what <HI>Revolutions</HI> he pleases with the utmost Ease and Certainty: A <HI>single</HI> Spirit in his Hand being as the <HI>Helm</HI> in the <HI>Pilots,</HI> to go∣vern the vastest Bodies of People, either in Mercy or in Judgment. At the <HI>Council-Board</HI> divine Providence presides, frustrating the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Ahithophel,</HI> and he <HI>hangs</HI> himself for Madness; and circumventing the deep Designs of <HI>Haman,</HI> and hangs him on the <HI>Gallows</HI> which he had rear'd
<PB N="69" REF="004489_0076_100D57E9950DC158"/>for another. Job 12.16—23. <HI>With him is Strength and Wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. He leadeth Counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the Judges fools. He looseth the Bond of Kings, and girdeth their Loins with a Girdle. He leadeth Princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the Mighty. He removeth away the Speech of the trusly, and taketh away the Understanding of the Aged. He poureth Contempt upon Princes, and weakneth the Strength of the Mighty. He discovereth deep Things out of Darkness, and bringeth out to Light the Shadow of Death.</HI> Now if this be the Domi∣nion of GOD over Kings and Governments, what must we say of it but as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> did, <HI>I bless the most High, and I praise and honour him that liveth for ever, whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom is from Generation to Generation: — I extol the King of Heaven, all whose Works are Truth, and his Ways Judgment, and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE is the Providence of GOD in its governing, ordering and disposing the Cir∣cumstances of every <HI>individual Person, Man, Wo∣man and Child,</HI> thro' every Generation: the <HI>Care</HI> that extends to all, the Power that <HI>protects,</HI> the Goodness that <HI>supplies</HI> all, and the Wisdom that <HI>orders</HI> the Concerns of all, in the <HI>best</HI> manner, for all <HI>together,</HI> and for each <HI>distinctly.</HI> This we must needs believe, but it is too <HI>mysterious</HI> to see clearly thro' it now.</P>
<P N="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is GOD's Empire over the <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, their <HI>Mind, Thoughts, Consciences, Wills, Desires, Purposes. The LORD searcheth
<PB N="70" REF="004489_0077_100D57EBD2F8A4C8"/>all Hearts,</HI> and knows all Thoughts: He gave <HI>Solomon</HI> his Wisdom and Largeness of Heart, <HI>David</HI> his Courage and Art for War, <HI>Abithophel</HI> and <HI>Hushai</HI> their Spirit of Counsel and Judgment; and <HI>Absalom's</HI> Rashness and Fickleness was also from his Dominion over the Spirit. As to Men's <HI>Desires</HI> he restrains them when he will, even a∣gainst their own Will: as he with-held <HI>Abimelech</HI> from touching <HI>Sarab,</HI> how fierce soever his Love, and his Soul inflam'd by her Beauty. Mens <HI>Pas∣sions</HI> and <HI>Wrath</HI> he lays, as he does the <HI>raging of the Sea</HI> and the noise of its Waves; so the <HI>Tumult of the People.</HI> Even the Spirits of the <HI>mutinous Multitude</HI> he governs, in all their wild <HI>Projects</HI> and <HI>Executions.</HI> He turns the Heart in a Mo∣ment from Hatred to Love, as <HI>Esau's</HI> to <HI>Jacob:</HI> and from Revenge into Endearment, as <HI>David</HI>'s before the wise <HI>Abigail;</HI> and again from Envy in∣to Admiration &amp; Esteem, as <HI>Saul</HI> when he stopp'd in the midst of his pursuit at the Voice of <HI>David,</HI> and turn'd back praising and blessing him. In like manner when the <HI>Soldiers</HI> in the heat of <HI>Fight</HI> and flush'd with <HI>Victory</HI> were rushing upon <HI>Jeboshaphat,</HI> the <HI>good King</HI> did but <HI>cry</HI> to the LORD and they <HI>turn'd</HI> from him. I might also speak here of GOD's Empire over <HI>Conscience,</HI> making Men a <HI>Terror</HI> to themselves when he pleases, as <HI>Cain, Saul</HI> and <HI>Judas.</HI> In <HI>these</HI> and many other ways GOD appears the Governor and the Judge of the <HI>Spirits of all Flesh.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. GREAT is the Empire of Providence <HI>in per∣mitting and over-ruling the Lusts and Sins of Men to its own Glory, and abundance of Good sometimes to Themselves and Others.</HI> It is a <HI>Mystery</HI> in Pro∣vidence,
<PB N="71" REF="004489_0078_100D57EEAE69CA48"/>which only <HI>Revelation</HI> can unfold to us and enlighten us in, that so much <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Con∣fusion</HI> therefrom is permitted to be in the World. But as Man bro't Sin and Misery upon himself, being made by GOD at first holy and happy; so the great GOD lets the fallen Creature see his Glory and Greatness in that he can yet <HI>govern Him,</HI> and his very <HI>Sins,</HI> and all the <HI>Mis∣chiefs and Disorders</HI> that attend the same, unto most <HI>wise and great and holy Ends;</HI> to <HI>his own</HI> Glory, to the Good of <HI>others,</HI> and even to the Salvation of Sinners themselves. <HI>Joseph's Bre∣thren</HI> sinn'd in <HI>selling</HI> him, his <HI>Mistress</HI> also in her foul and false <HI>Accusation</HI> of him; they glutted their <HI>Hatred and Spite,</HI> and tho't they had <HI>ruin'd</HI> him for ever: but all the while they were the <HI>In∣struments</HI> of Providence toward his <HI>Advancement,</HI> and the saving of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Canaan</HI> and <HI>Them∣selves</HI> from Famine. <HI>Haman</HI> meditated his own <HI>Revenge,</HI> and the satiating his <HI>bloody Hatred</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> but Providence made it the very means of their <HI>Peace &amp; Enlargement. Pharaob</HI>'s <HI>Hard∣ness</HI> gave GOD and his <HI>Israel</HI> those <HI>Triumphs,</HI> which will be celebrated in the <HI>Church</HI> for ever. The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Romans, Herod</HI> and <HI>Pilate</HI> united against the LORD <HI>CHRIST</HI> and <HI>crucify'd</HI> him; but it was to do what the <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Counsel</HI> of GOD had <HI>before determined</HI> for the <HI>Salvation</HI> of the World, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.26, 28. Yea, Mens <HI>foul Sins</HI> have been made the Means of their own <HI>Conversion:</HI> O <HI>mysterious</HI> Providence, and <HI>unsearchable</HI> Grace! Thus are Sinners sometimes effectually <HI>awakened</HI> to see their own exceeding <HI>Vileness,</HI> and Sins <HI>sin∣fulness.</HI> <Q>Thus <HI>Medicines</HI> are made of <HI>Poisons,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="004489_0079_100D57F0D4A7D780"/>and the <HI>Flesh</HI> of the <HI>Scorpion</HI> a <HI>Cure</HI> for the <HI>Bite</HI> of it.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Mystery of GOD's governing Providence in the <HI>present unequal Dis∣pensations of Prosperity and Adversity.</HI> This from the Days of Old has been a <HI>Wonder</HI> in Providence, if not an <HI>Objection</HI> against it. <HI>Job</HI> in his <HI>Adora∣tions</HI> spake of it, as well as <HI>Asaph</HI> in his <HI>Insirmity</HI> complain'd of it. But it is easy to clear the <HI>Ju∣stice, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of Providence in this Disposition of Things, from the Consideration of GOD's <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> our own <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Deserts,</HI> the distinguishing <HI>Judgments</HI> we see at times inflicted on <HI>singular Sinners,</HI> and the Knowledge we have of a <HI>future State,</HI> and a <HI>just Recompence</HI> then to every one according to his Works done here in the Body. Yet nothing is more Mysterious and Unsearchable than <HI>this Conduct</HI> of Providence in a thousand <HI>particular Instances,</HI> if we consider them by <HI>themselves.</HI> Thus for Instance, <HI>Job</HI>'s <HI>Trial</HI> was an unsearchable Thing; <HI>amazing</HI> to himself, as well as <HI>confounding</HI> to his wise and religious Friends. And so very often have the Dispensa∣tions of Providence been dark and mysterious to∣ward the <HI>Church.</HI> Isai. 31.2. <HI>He also is wise and will bring Evil.</HI> 45.15. <HI>Verily thou art a GOD that hidest thy self, O GOD of Israel the Saviour.</HI> Psal. 36.6. <HI>Thy Righteousness is like the great Mountains, thy Judgments are a great deep; O LORD thou preservest Man and Beast.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have very briefly consider'd the <HI>Great∣ness and Majesty of GOD in that Providence, which HE exercises over the Highest and Greatest of his
<PB N="73" REF="004489_0080_100D57F2C3433C50"/>Works: whether Things, Animals, or Persons.</HI> This is his <HI>high Dominion,</HI> and full of incomprehensible Mystery, but bright with <HI>dazling Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TWO Words</HI> remain still on this <HI>Subject,</HI> besides those <HI>infinite Researches</HI> which I shall not enter at all into; <HI>scil.</HI> The Government of <HI>Providence</HI> over the <HI>least</HI> and <HI>lowest</HI> Creatures, and over <HI>Ac∣cidents</HI> and <HI>Chance</HI> as we call it.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE:</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Greatness and Majesty of GOD is un∣searchable in that Providence which he exercises over the <HI>least and lowest of his Creatures.</HI> For it is most certain that the preserving and govern∣ing Providence of GOD extends to the <HI>meanest and most minute Things</HI> which he has made: Nor can this look <HI>little</HI> in the <HI>supream Majesty</HI> of Hea∣ven, but it is his <HI>true and infinite Greatness.</HI> It is not like the contemptible <HI>Idleness</HI> and <HI>Childish∣ness</HI> of the <HI>Roman Emperor,</HI> who was trifling and <HI>catching Flies</HI> when he should have been at the <HI>Council-Board,</HI> bearing and directing the weighty Affairs of the <HI>Empire.</HI> GOD <HI>neglects none</HI> of his Creatures, and least of all do the <HI>greater Affairs</HI> of the World escape him. His <HI>general and com∣mon Care</HI> is to the <HI>least,</HI> a more <HI>special Providence</HI> is over the <HI>greatest.</HI></P>
<P>THE narrow Mind of <HI>Man</HI> can attend but to a <HI>few</HI> Things at a time, and therefore they had need always be the <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>weightier:</HI> but the infinite <HI>GOD</HI> with the same Ease governs and cares for a <HI>Million</HI> of Creatures as <HI>One;</HI> and <HI>ten
<PB N="74" REF="004489_0081_100D57F4E59E43A8"/>Million swarms of Gnats,</HI> as a Family of Men. Nor is it <HI>below</HI> him, any more than it was to <HI>create the Insect,</HI> which all the Art and Powers of Creatures can't do. Nay, the Things which GOD has seen good to make, he <HI>must needs</HI> take care of, for they are the Work of his Hand.</P>
<P>"Do you see thousands of <HI>little Motes and Atoms</HI> wandring up and down in a <HI>Sun-Beam?</HI> (says Bishop <HI>Hopkins</HI>) it is GOD that so peoples it: He <HI>guides</HI> their in numerable and irregular Stray∣ings: Not a <HI>Dust</HI> flies in the beaten Road, but its uncertain Motion is guided, and the <HI>Storm</HI> shall not carry it further than its appointed Place.</P>
<P>OUR SAVIOUR tells us that the <HI>Hairs of our Head are numbred,</HI> and that tho' <HI>two Sparrows</HI> be but the Price of a <HI>Farthing, yet not one of them falls to the Ground without our Father in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 10.29, 30. The <HI>great GOD</HI> also was pleased to <HI>magnify himself</HI> to his Servant <HI>Job,</HI> from the Care he takes of the <HI>wild Goats of the Rocks,</HI> and the <HI>wild Asses of the Wilderness. David</HI> ce∣lebrates his Maker likewise from his Care of the <HI>Birds of the Air,</HI> and the <HI>Shoals of small Fish in the Sea.</HI> It is the Honour and Glory of GOD thus to extend his Care to the most <HI>minute</HI> of his Works.</P>
<P>FOR how <HI>great</HI> would that <HI>King</HI> be tho't, who were <HI>able to know and supply</HI> every Want of the least of his Subjects, and could daily serve them with the Fruits of his <HI>royal Bounty?</HI> It is record∣ed to the Honour of the <HI>Grecian Prince,</HI> that he could callevery one of his vast <HI>Army</HI> by Name; and
<PB N="75" REF="004489_0082_100D57F7F4E4FC30"/>is it not the Glory of GOD to know and provide for the least of all <HI>his Hosts?</HI> That as it is said of <HI>Moses,</HI> so in a Sense it may be of <HI>every Creature, — I know thee by Name, and thou hast found Grace in my Sight,</HI> so far as the Necessities of thy Na∣ture and Place in my Creation requires. Or as it is said of the <HI>Stars,</HI> so may it be of a <HI>Fly</HI> or a <HI>Mote,</HI> Psal. 147.4. <HI>He telleth the Number of them all, he calleth them all by their Names: Great is our LORD, and of great Power, his Understanding is infinite.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, We know also how GOD <HI>uses the smallest Creatures</HI> in his wise Providence <HI>to the greatest Effects,</HI> and in unsearchable <HI>Manner</HI> to the <HI>Preservation</HI> or <HI>Destruction of Mankind.</HI> How many gross and <HI>noxious Attoms</HI> do the <HI>Flics,</HI> the <HI>Spiders,</HI> the <HI>Toads,</HI> &amp;c, suck in and deliver us from? And so GOD's Care of them is his Care of <HI>us:</HI> Their <HI>ministry</HI> to us is unknown. Again, GOD brings forth his <HI>great Armies of Caterpillars, Locusts, Canker-Worms, and Palmer-Worms,</HI> and how do the Inhabitants of the Earth tremble and fail before them? Thus <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his <HI>King∣doms</HI> were plagued with <HI>Lice,</HI> and beaten by <HI>Frogs and Flies.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III To multiply no further Instances: The Greatness of Providence is unsearchable in its Cog∣nizance, Disposing and Government of what we call <HI>Accident and Chance, Fortuitous and Casual.</HI> Many things are so <HI>to us,</HI> but nothing is so to GOD. They are his <HI>Counsel,</HI> tho' to us <HI>Contingent.</HI> The <HI>Divine Mind</HI> directs in all casual <HI>Motions and Events.</HI> There is no <HI>Goddess Fortune</HI> to be found
<PB N="76" REF="004489_0083_100D57F98137F360"/><HI>in Heaven,</HI> however the blind <HI>Heathen Poet</HI> wou'd have <HI>plac'd her there.</HI> It suits only the Mouth of a <HI>Philistine</HI> to say, <HI>A Chance has hapned unto us.</HI> There is no such Thing to an <HI>Omniscient Mind,</HI> an <HI>all-disposing Providence.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lot <HI>is cast into the Lap, but the whole disposing it is of GOD,</HI> Prov. 16.33 Thus <HI>A∣chan</HI> was accurately selected out of the many thousands of <HI>Israel.</HI> It was an <HI>Appeal</HI> to the di∣vine Providence to discover the <HI>Sinner</HI> and his <HI>accursed Thing.</HI> So <HI>Jonathan</HI> was taken, or ra∣ther his <HI>rash Father</HI> for his unadvised <HI>Adjuration.</HI> Hence the use of <HI>Lottery</HI> has been by many e∣steemed too <HI>sacred</HI> to be made common; because the LORD only can <HI>give a perfect Lot.</HI> To be sure the religious and solemn Use of it supposes the Government of divine Providence in those things that are most contingent with us.</P>
<P>DISGUIZED <HI>Ahab</HI> was thus singled out, not by the <HI>Soldier,</HI> but by <HI>Providence</HI> in the <HI>Battel. He drew a Bow at a venture,</HI> but the Arrow enter'd between the <HI>Joints of the Harness of the King of Israel. Accidental</HI> to their own Intention Men often accomplish <HI>special Purposes</HI> of GOD; and are <HI>Instrumental</HI> of much undesigned Good in their <HI>occasional Actions; Natural, Civil and Political. Pharaoh's Dau'ter</HI> came accidentally to the <HI>River</HI> to take up <HI>Moses,</HI> and give him a <HI>Princely Edu∣cation,</HI> to be in time the <HI>Deliverer of Israel. Au∣gustus</HI> his <HI>Taxing</HI> the World fulfilled the glorious <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Messiah's Birth at Betblehem. Saul</HI> by wandring after his <HI>Asses</HI> is led to a <HI>Crown.</HI> When a Man <HI>shoots</HI> after <HI>Game</HI> and kills his
<PB N="77" REF="004489_0084_100D57FB2773ABA0"/>Nei'bour whom he saw not, or if a Man be <HI>fel∣ling a Tree</HI> and the Head of his <HI>Ax</HI> fly off and kill his Nei'bour, in these Cases the <HI>LORD is said to deliver</HI> the one and the other into his Nei'bours Hand.</P>
<P>IN short:</P>
<P>WHATEVER is done <HI>by Design,</HI> or wherein the Wills of Men are pursued, is by do means done at last without the Will of GOD <HI>over-ruling</HI> them: And whatever is effected <HI>without</HI> or <HI>against</HI> the Mind of Creatures, has the Counsel and Di∣rection of GOD in it.</P>
<P>AND now let us make a <HI>pause</HI> a little, and con∣template the unsearchable <HI>Perfection</HI> shining forth in <HI>this Government</HI> of the World! What <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge!</HI> What <HI>Goodress, Care</HI> and <HI>Bounty!</HI> What <HI>Power!</HI> and in <HI>all</HI> what <HI>Greatness!</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WISDOM and Knowledge.</HI> So <HI>Ezekiel</HI> in Vision saw the <HI>Wheels</HI> (the Globes and Orbs of the Universe, rolling like Balls) on their <HI>four Sides;</HI> the Rim of them high and dreadful, and <HI>full of Eyes</HI> round about. The Eye of Providence is on the whole <HI>Circle</HI> of Creatures, and all their Motions are wisely directed thereby; as if every <HI>Orb</HI> had a Million of <HI>Eyes,</HI> and each of them a <HI>wise Intelligence</HI> for its Guidance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOODNESS</HI> to the <HI>least</HI> and to the <HI>worst</HI> of Creatures: rich, free and sovereign <HI>Goodness!</HI> Never weary, never failing! never short or scan∣ty! But abundantly sufficient, and super-abundant
<PB N="78" REF="004489_0085_100D57FE2AD4D030"/>to all the Numbers, and all the wide Extents, and all the capacious Natures in the Universe. <HI>The Earth is full of his Riches.</HI> The World swims in it as in a boundless <HI>Ocean;</HI> and its <HI>Streams</HI> run circling thro' all its habitable Parts to water them: the <HI>River of GOD which is full of Water!</HI> all Creature daily drink thereof and are filled. The divine Bounty that supplies us Day by Day is like the <HI>Manna</HI> every Morning about our Dwel∣lings; and the <HI>Flights</HI> of <HI>Quails</HI> of old might soon∣er far be numbred than the Supplies of every Evening. <HI>The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulness thereof:</HI> It's Stores are divided among the Children of Men with a munificent Hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE <HI>Power</HI> is display'd in the Exercise of a <HI>Providence</HI> over all Things. <HI>The Eyes of the LORD run to and fro, thro' the whole Earth, to show himself</HI> STRONG, 2 Chron. 16.9. There is no Government without <HI>Power,</HI> to com∣mand, constrain &amp; punish. Much less can the U∣niverse be govern'd without supream, absolute and irresistible Power. No Creature has Power to pre∣serve it self, and less can any one uphold another in Being and Action. <HI>Equal</HI> is the Power of God seen, whether in keeping to the <HI>ordinary</HI> Course of Nature, or in <HI>preter-natural</HI> Effects: Whether when he keeps on in the usual Course of <HI>Mercy</HI> to a sinful World; or when he changes the Face of Providence and comes forth in ways of <HI>Judg∣ment.</HI> He equally shows the Might of his Arm, when he casts down the <HI>Mighty</HI> from their Seat, or when he exalts the <HI>Humble:</HI> when he showers down <HI>Blessings,</HI> or when he pours down <HI>Hail and Fire:</HI> when he uses a <HI>Fly</HI> as when he uses an <HI>An∣gel</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="004489_0086_100D58004F8AC668"/>to minister unto his Will. For which is great∣est? to effect great Things by <HI>small Means,</HI> or to use those which he has <HI>greatly endowed,</HI> and made in some Measure equal to the Effect produced. In either the <HI>Greatness</HI> of Providence doth equal∣ly appear. Joh 42.2. <HI>I know that thou canst do every Thing, and that no Thought can be withholden from thee.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Use</HI> shall be in <HI>three Words</HI> only: name∣ly, to teach us <HI>Resignation, Adoration</HI> and <HI>Obe∣dience.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>RESIGNATION to the great GOD in all his unsearchable Providences:</HI> whether of a <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>private</HI> Reference, or of a <HI>publick</HI> Nature and Concern. However GOD dispose of us or our <HI>Families,</HI> or whatever he order concerning <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of the Earth, or how dark soever his Providence may look with respect to his <HI>Church,</HI> his Cause &amp; Interest thro' the World; we must <HI>be still and know that</HI> He <HI>is GOD; who will be exalted in the Earth.</HI> The highest Crea∣tures owe an <HI>absolute Submission</HI> to the Will of the unsearchable GOD. Eccl. 3.14. <HI>For I know that whatsoever GOD doeth it shall be for ever: no∣thing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and GOD doeth it that Men should fear before him.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not for us to <HI>Doubt</HI> or Question the Good∣ness, Righteousness or Wisdom of GOD. What∣ever the Sins of Persons and Times are, or what∣ever Calamities come upon a sinful World; let it quiet and silence us to remember that <HI>GOD go∣verns.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="004489_0087_100D580288DF29F8"/>We must adore Him that dwells in the thick Darkness: Psal. 97.2. <HI>Clouds and Dark∣ness are round about him, but Righteousness and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne.</HI></P>
<P><Q>WHO has directed the Spirit of the LORD? or being his Counsellor has taught him? With whom took he Counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the Path of Judg∣ment, and taught him Knowledge, and shewed to him the Way of Understanding? Behold the Nations are as a Drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the small Dust of the Ballance: Be∣hold he taketh up the Isles as a very little thing: — All Nations are before him as No∣thing, and they are counted to him less than Nothing and Vanity, <HI>Isa.</HI> 40.13, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE ALMIGHTY thus silenc'd <HI>Job,</HI> and stopt his complaining Tongue, and bro't him to his <HI>first Submissions and Worship: Behold I am vile, what shall I answer thee? I will lay my Hand up∣on my Mouth.</HI> How vainly had <HI>Job</HI> said before, that <HI>as a Prince he wou'd dare to go near even to his Judge, and come even to his Seat</HI> in the Con∣science of his Integrity? No, when his <HI>Judge</HI> came and spake, and shew'd him his incompre∣hensible Glory in his Works; the <HI>holy abased Man</HI> left off his arguing, and fell to worshiping as he began at first: <HI>I have uttered that I under∣stood not, things too wonderful for me that I knew not: — Now mine Eye seeth thee, wherefore I ab∣hor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="004489_0088_100D58047435B900"/>
WHEREFORE:</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>EXPRESS and awful Adoration, Prayer and Praise</HI> are a meet Acknowledgment of the unsearchable Providence of GOD. We must <HI>fall down and worship.</HI> And whence should we take our <HI>high Adorations</HI> of GOD'S excellent Greatness, but out of <HI>his Word? Words</HI> only worthy of <HI>Him∣self,</HI> being his own <HI>Inspiration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Psal</HI> 95 3—6. <Q>For the LORD is a great GOD, and a great King above all gods. In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth: the Strength of the Hills is his also. The Sea is his, for he made it; and his Hands formed the dry Land. O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Ma∣ker.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Psal.</HI> 96. 3,—9. <Q>Declare his Glory among Heathen, his Wonders among all People. For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the Nations are Idols, but the LORD made the Heavens. Honour and Majesty are before him, Strength and Beauty are in his Sanctuary. Give unto the LORD, O ye Kin∣dreds of the People; give unto the LORD Glo∣ry and Strength. Give unto the LORD the Glory due unto his Name: bring an Offering and come into his Courts. O worship the LORD in the Beauty of Holiness: fear before him all the Earch. Say among the Heathen that the LORD reigneth: the World also shall be esta∣blished that it shall not be moved: He shall judge the People righteously.</Q></P>

<HI>Psal.</HI> 103.19,—22. <Q>The Lord hath prepa∣red his Throne in the Heavens, and his King∣dom ruleth over all. Bless the LORD ye his Angels that excel in Strength; that do his Commandments, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. Bless ye the LORD all ye his Hosts, ye Ministers of his that do his Pleasure. Bless the LORD all his Works in all Places of his Dominion: Bless the LORD O my Soul.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Psal.</HI> 104. <HI>ult.</HI> <Q>The Glory of the Lord shall endure for ever, the LORD shall rejoice in his Works.

<P><HI>Psal.</HI> 136. <Q>O give Thanks unto the GOD of gods! O give Thanks unto the LORD of lords!—To him who alone doeth great Won∣ders; — To him that by Wisdom made the Heavens: To him that stretched out the Earth above the Waters; — To him that made great Lights: — The Sun to rule by Day, — the Moon and Stars to rule by Night: — Who giveth Food to all Flesh: for his Mercy endu∣reth for ever: O give thanks unto the GOD of Heaven, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Psal</HI> 148. <Q>Praise ye the LORD from the Heavens! Praise him in the Heights! Praise ye him all his Angels! Praise ye him all his Hosts! Praise him Sun and Moon! Praise him all ye

<P><Q>PRAISE the LORD from the Earth, ye Dra∣gons and all Deeps! Fire and Hail, Snow and. Vapour, stormy Wind fulfilling his Word! Mountains and all Hills, fruitful Trees and all Cedars! Beasts and all Cattel, creeping Things and slying Fowl! Kings of the Earth and all People! Princes and all Judges of the Earth! both young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children! let them praise the Name of the LORD, for his Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III.

And shall We be the <HI>only Rebels</HI> &amp; Disobedient? Shall we not learn of the <HI>Creatures</HI> a <HI>dutifui Ob∣servance</HI> of the Will of GOD in our Places, Ac∣tions and moral Conduct?

<P>IN some little manner we have been contemplating the <HI>great GOD</HI> in his unsearchable <HI>Essence</HI> and <HI>Works:</HI> His glorious Works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> have been considered; and now I go on in the <HI>third and last Place,</HI> and so <HI>finish</HI> my short <HI>Essay</HI> on this infinite and <HI>unsearchable Subject.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. GOD is unsearchable and incomprehensible in the glorious Work of our REDEMPTION <HI>by the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is by way of Eminence <HI>the Mystery.</HI> It is so to <HI>Angels</HI> as well as <HI>Men.</HI> Mysterious <HI>Grace!</HI> which we could never have conceived of, and which it had been high Presumption and Blasphe∣my
<PB N="86" REF="004489_0093_100D58121DEA5B10"/>to have imagined, if it had not been revealed to us by GOD: And now it is revealed it is never to be comprehended, but to be studied and look'd into for ever (in the Church here, as it is in Hea∣ven by Saints and Angels there) with Admiration, Astonishment and Praises.</P>
<P>WE read, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.8. Of <HI>the unsearchable Riches of Christ. Riches</HI> imply <HI>abundance,</HI> and an abundance of those Things which are in them∣selves of great <HI>intrinsic Worth,</HI> Price and Value. <HI>These</HI> are immensly to be found in Christ; the <HI>Treasures</HI> of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>UNSEARCHABLE Riches! never to have been <HI>discovered</HI> by the Wit of Man, and <HI>incomprehen∣sible</HI> to us now after the Discovery of them. The <HI>Mystery</HI> hid from Ages and Generations, but now made manifest to the Saints; (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks to the <HI>Colossians</HI>) to whom GOD would make known the <HI>Riches of the Glory</HI> of it; which is <HI>Christ</HI> in you the Hope of Glory, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.27.</P>
<P>IT is a wonderful Passage in Eph. 3.10. <HI>To the Intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, might be known by the Church the manifold Wisdom of GOD</HI> The Mystery of our <HI>Redemption</HI> was a <HI>secret</HI> to the glorious <HI>An∣gels,</HI> who <HI>gradually</HI> have come into the Know∣ledge of it by <HI>Revelation,</HI> and that <HI>mediately</HI> by the <HI>Church</HI> on Earth, as GOD has occasionally re∣vealed it more and more to us. Hence the Apo∣stle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Angels desire to look in∣to these Things,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.12. They are ever seeking and ever gaining a more perfect <HI>Insight</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="004489_0094_100D5813A43491E8"/>into this Mystery; and as they gaze on this <HI>Light of GOD's Glory in the Face of Jesus Christ,</HI> so grows their Admiration and Delight in their high State of Blessedness. Therefore were the <HI>Cherubims</HI> placed over the <HI>Mercy-Seat</HI> of old, <HI>Exod.</HI> 25.20. to fignify how <HI>Angels pry</HI> with Wonder and in∣tent Admiration into the Mysteries of our Re∣demption. "These sublime and transcendent Manifestations of the Glory of GOD are ravishing and transporting to adoring Angels. Their Eyes above are all turn'd toward, and fixt upon the <HI>Mercy-Seat:</HI> <Q>They worship the <HI>Redeemer</HI>'s Person; the Manner and Method of our Re∣demption astonishes them; accurate and earnest is their Inspection, but their vast Capacities can never comprehend it.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED the Apostle to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> speaks of the Capacity of <HI>all Saints,</HI> GOD granting them <HI>according to the Riches of his Glory, to be strength∣ned with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man, to comprehend what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Heighth, and to know the Love of Christ which passes Knowledge,</HI> being <HI>filled with all the Fulness of GOD.</HI> But these Words explain themselves, for there can be no proper <HI>Compre∣hension</HI> of that which <HI>passeth Knowledge;</HI> where∣fore the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s meaning can be no more than this — Such a <HI>simple Apprehension</HI> and Belief of the mysterious Truths, such a <HI>clear and distinct</HI> Understanding of them, as to <HI>affect</HI> our Souls with the unsearchable Wisdom and Grace of GOD therein display'd.</P>

<P N="1">I. UNSEARCHABLE is the Mystery of our Re∣demption <HI>in the Person of the</HI> REDEEMER. And that whether we consider Him in his <HI>eternal Gene∣ration, the only-begotten of the Father;</HI> or in his <HI>Incarnation, God-Man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. How unsearchable is the <HI>Doctrine of the Re∣deemer's eternal Generation and Sonship?</HI> His <HI>Di∣vinity and God-head, the Sameness of Essence, and Equality in Glory with the Father, from Everlast∣ing.</HI> This supposes the Doctrine of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and is built on that Foundation. This eternal <HI>Communication of Essence</HI> is a thing ineffable, yet firmly to be believ'd by us in adoring Humility: <HI>scil.</HI> That there is a glorious <HI>second Person</HI> in the eternal GODHEAD, <HI>very GOD of very GOD, be∣gotten not made.</HI> How unsearchable are all those mysterious, and yet plain positive <HI>Texts,</HI> which teach us <HI>this Truth?</HI> John 1.1. <HI>In the Beginning was the WORD, and the Word was with GOD, and the Word was GOD.</HI> John 5.26. <HI>As the FATHER hath Life in Himself, so hath he given to the SON to have Life in Himself.</HI> John 16.15. <HI>All that the Father hath is mine.</HI> John 10.30. <HI>I and my Father are One.</HI></P>
<P>HERE is the divine Nature <HI>totally</HI> communi∣cated; and so the <HI>Begotten</HI> the same divine Being
<PB N="89" REF="004489_0096_100D58175414DA98"/>with him that <HI>begetteth;</HI> in the <HI>Form</HI> of GOD, and without robbery <HI>equal</HI> to GOD: the <HI>Brightness</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI>'s Glory, and the express <HI>Image</HI> of his <HI>Person,</HI> Phil. 2.6. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3.</P>
<P>HOW expressly are we <HI>told</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI>— that the LORD <HI>possessed him</HI> in the Beginning, — that he was set up <HI>from Everlasting:</HI> and how ex∣presly are we <HI>required</HI> to believe in the Name of the <HI>only-begotten Son of GOD?</HI> And how <HI>often</HI> is <HI>this Stile</HI> used to us—We beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the <HI>Only-begotten</HI> of the <HI>Father:</HI> — No Man hath seen GOD at any time, the <HI>Only-begotten</HI> which is in the Bosom of the <HI>Father,</HI> he hath declared him.</P>
<P>BUT who shall conceive of or <HI>declare his Gene∣ration? Wise Agur adores</HI> in the Meditation of this inconceivable Thing; and teaches us to do so too, and not <HI>break through</HI> unto the LORD to <HI>gaze:</HI> Prov. 30.2,—6. <HI>Surely I have not the Know∣ledge of the Holy! What is his Name, and what is his Son's Name, if thou canst tell? Every Word of GOD is pure: add thou not unto his Words, lest he reprove thee and thou be found a Liar.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST truly <HI>was,</HI> and did exist <HI>before</HI> all Worlds: Yea the <HI>Worlds</HI> were <HI>made by him;</HI> therefore is he the CREATOR himself, and so <HI>es∣sentially Divine.</HI> Yet was the divine Nature pos∣sessed by him <HI>communicated</HI> from the FATHER, perfect and total, and so a <HI>proper</HI> Generation; incommunicable and utterly impossible to any <HI>Creature:</HI> for to which of the <HI>Angels</HI> said he at any time, <HI>Thou art my Son, this Day have I be∣gotten
<PB N="90" REF="004489_0097_100D581A16F86EA0"/>thee?</HI>—but to the <HI>Son</HI> he saith, <HI>Thy Throne O GOD is for ever and ever:</HI> and when he bring∣eth in the <HI>First-Begotten</HI> into the World he saith, <HI>And let all the Angels of GOD worship him,</HI> Heb. 1.5, 6.</P>
<P>Now who can unfold and explain this <HI>sublime Doctrine?</HI> This <HI>incomprehensible Person;</HI> the Image of the invisible GOD! Col. 1.15, 16. <HI>For by Him were all Things created, visible or invisible; whe∣ther they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principali∣ties, or Powers! all Things were created by him and for him; and he is before all Things, and by him all Things consist.</HI></P>
<P>SEE then the Riches of the Glory of the GOD-HEAD in the <HI>Person of Christ:</HI> who it is that has given to Angels and Men all the Perfection of their Being, Life, Endowments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Contem∣plate the <HI>Treasures</HI> of creating Wisdom, Power and Goodness <HI>in Him</HI> and flowing from Him! HE together with the FATHER, the <HI>One</HI> infinite and everlasting over-flowing Fountain of all <HI>Be∣ing</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> in the Creatures! The Author, End and Upholder of them all! "<HI>All Things were created by him and for him; he is before all Things, and by him all Things consist.</HI> Here is the <HI>Riches of the Deity,</HI> the <HI>Fulness of the GODHEAD in Christ,</HI> Heb. 1.2, 3. Col. 1.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. How unsearchable is the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of this <HI>divine Person?</HI> The <HI>personal Union</HI> of the <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> Nature in him! "That he is GOD and <HI>Man</HI> in <HI>two</HI> distinct Na∣tures, and <HI>one</HI> Person for ever. — Without Con∣troversy
<PB N="91" REF="004489_0098_100D581C31B3E080"/>great is this <HI>Mystery of Godliness;</HI> GOD manifested in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> by a miraculous Concep∣tion of a <HI>Virgin!</HI> What <HI>new</HI> and <HI>single</HI> Thing is this which GOD hath <HI>created</HI> for our Redemption! his <HI>only Son</HI> assuming our Nature! The <HI>immense Being compassed</HI> in a Womb, and <HI>tabernacling</HI> in a House of Clay! <HI>A Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, whose Name is Immanuel.</HI></P>
<P>I will chuse the Words of the excellent Bishop <HI>Beveridge,</HI> wherein to lay this mysterious <HI>Doctrine</HI> before you <Q>A <HI>personal</HI> Union of <HI>two</HI> distinct <HI>Natures:</HI> Not as if the <HI>divine</HI> Nature took up∣on it a <HI>human</HI> Person, but a <HI>divine</HI> Person took upon him the <HI>human</HI> Nature: Not the divine Nature in <HI>general,</HI> without respect to the <HI>Per∣sons,</HI> but <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>Persons</HI> in the <HI>divine</HI> Na∣ture took upon him our <HI>Flesh.</HI> Yet not the divine <HI>Person</HI> abstracted or distinct from the di∣vine <HI>Nature;</HI> but it was the <HI>divine</HI> Nature in that <HI>Person</HI> which thus took upon it the <HI>human.</HI> — Thus the Son of GOD, in the glorious <HI>Tri∣nity,</HI> is become the Son of <HI>Man</HI> in a gracious <HI>Mystery:</HI> — Not leaving his <HI>Godhead</HI> to take upon him the <HI>Manhood;</HI> but he took the <HI>Man∣hood</HI> to his <HI>Godhead.</HI> — The divine Person so assumed the human Nature as still to remain a <HI>divine Person;</HI> and the human Nature was so assumed into a divine Person as still to remain the <HI>human Nature.</HI> GOD therefore so became <HI>Man,</HI> as to be both perfectly GOD and perfect∣ly Man, united together in <HI>one Person:</HI> — So that every Action which he <HI>did,</HI> and every Passion which he <HI>suffer'd,</HI> was done and suffer'd by him that was GOD as well as Man. And
<PB N="92" REF="004489_0099_100D58407498E3B8"/>hence it is that CHRIST is <HI>so</HI> fit, yea <HI>only</HI> fit, to be our Redeemer, Mediator and Surety; be∣cause he alone is both GOD and Man in one Person. If he was not Man he could not <HI>un∣dertake</HI> that Office; if he was not GOD he could not <HI>perform</HI> it.—Man can <HI>suffer,</HI> but he cannot <HI>satisfy;</HI> GOD can <HI>satisfy</HI> but he cannot <HI>suffer:</HI> but CHRIST being both GOD and <HI>Man</HI> can both suffer and satisfy too; and so is perfectly fit both to <HI>suffer</HI> for <HI>Man,</HI> and to make <HI>Satisfaction</HI> un∣to GOD; to reconcile GOD to Man, and Man to GOD.</Q></P>
<P>THUS unsearchable is the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of the Son of GOD, or his <HI>Assumption</HI> of our Nature. We must neither enquire from <HI>Doubting</HI> nor from <HI>Curiosity — How can these Things be?</HI> What is there too <HI>great</HI> or <HI>hard</HI> for the LORD? And who shall unfold his Work? We must sit down <HI>con∣tent</HI> in the <HI>Angel</HI>'s Words to the <HI>blessed Virgin;</HI> It is of the HOLY GHOST, <HI>and the Power of the Highest:</HI> which <HI>Power</HI> and its glorious <HI>Effects</HI> who can <HI>understand?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Humiliations, Sufferings and DEATH</HI> of the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> in our Nature, are an unsearch∣able Mystery. If the Son of GOD were indeed to come in the <HI>Likeness of Flesh,</HI> yet tho't the <HI>Jews</HI> not in any Likeness of that <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> into which we are fallen. He cou'd not come (tho't they) in a <HI>low</HI> and <HI>humble</HI> Condition, in a poor, <HI>contemptible</HI> and <HI>afflicted State,</HI> to redeem us by Sufferings, and an <HI>accursed Death:</HI> No, said they, the <HI>Messiah</HI> will come as a triumphant <HI>King</HI> and Conqueror, in Power and <HI>Pomp,</HI> in
<PB N="93" REF="004489_0100_100D30E220FAB408"/>worldly Grandeur and <HI>Splendor.</HI> Hence were they so <HI>offended,</HI> in spite of all their ancient <HI>Pro∣phecies,</HI> at the <HI>mean</HI> Appearance of our Saviour. They could not <HI>take</HI> Him to be the Son of GOD, whom in the midst of all his divine Words and Works, they beheld in outward Appearance to be but a <HI>mortified</HI> holy <HI>Prophet: Astonish'd</HI> indeed at his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Miracles,</HI> but <HI>stumbled</HI> at his Poverty and <HI>Cross:</HI> An <HI>enthron'd Messiah</HI> they look'd for, and behold a <HI>crucified One:</HI> This was such a <HI>Stone of Stumbling,</HI> and <HI>Rock of Offence</HI> to them, that they fell on it and were <HI>broken to pieces.</HI> But <HI>blessed</HI> are they whosoever are not <HI>offended</HI> at that, which they ought rather to <HI>admire</HI> with the most profound <HI>Veneration.</HI></P>
<P>IT must needs be <HI>stupendous</HI> to us to meditate, the <HI>supream Lawgiver</HI> obeying and fulfilling the divine Law, to work out a Righteousness for the Justification of Sinners; and then bearing the <HI>Curse</HI> of the holy Law to expiate and atone for our Guilt in the Transgression thereof. What an <HI>amazing</HI> Tho't is it for the <HI>Most High</HI> GOD to take the <HI>Form of a Servant;</HI> and the Possessor of Hea∣ven and Earth to appear in a destitute Estate, that we thro' his Poverty might be enrich'd! For the most <HI>blessed Being</HI> to subject himself to <HI>Sorrows,</HI> and HE who alone hath <HI>Immortality</HI> to <HI>Die!</HI> For the most <HI>holy One</HI> to be made <HI>Sin</HI> for us, and the most <HI>just One</HI> a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to divine Justice! What <HI>Paradoxes</HI> are these Things, which <HI>break</HI> our Tho'ts in the Meditation of them, even as <HI>Nature was convuls'd</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> of our LORD? Now it <HI>beclouds</HI> our Minds with Dark∣ness,
<PB N="94" REF="004489_0101_100D581E7B058EE0"/>and then <HI>dazzles</HI> them with Light, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 23, 24. 2.6, —10.</P>
<P N="3">III. UNSEARCHABLE are the <HI>Benefits of Re∣demption.</HI> Who can comprehend, conceive of or utter what is the <HI>Price</HI> of GOD's <HI>pardoning</HI> Mercy, of <HI>sanctifying</HI> Grace, or of <HI>eternal</HI> Salva∣tion?</P>
<P N="1">1. The Worth of <HI>pardoning Mercy: Adoption</HI> in Christ, <HI>Justification</HI> thro' him, and <HI>Reconcilia∣tion</HI> to God. That guilty, condemned, perishing Sinners, the Heirs of Death and Hell, should ob∣tain the Remission of their Sins, become Righ∣teous in the Eyes of the holy GOD, his Children by Faith in Christ Jesus, and his Soul have Plea∣sure in them, even as tho' they had not been <HI>born</HI> nor <HI>liv'd</HI> in Sin! <HI>What manner</HI> of Love is this, which the Father hath bestowed upon us, that <HI>we</HI> should be called the Sons of God? Let a convinced Sinner, a <HI>wounded Spirit</HI> say, what the Worth of a Pardon is: or let him that thro' Grace has the comfortable Sense of his <HI>sealed Pardon</HI> declare if he can the inestimable Price of it! Let <HI>Saints in Glory</HI> look down &amp; tell it us in their <HI>smiling Joys!</HI> Or let us look down into the <HI>Pit below,</HI> and read it in the Anguishes and Wailings of the <HI>Damned.</HI> Psal. 32. 1, 2. <HI>Blessed is he whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin is covered,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HEAR the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of a justify'd State <Q>— I know in whom I have believed—Behold, now are we the Sons of God—and if Children then Heirs—Ye know that ye have eternal Life— Who is it that condemneth, it is Christ that
<PB N="95" REF="004489_0102_100D58206D955790"/>died—What shall separate us from the Love of GOD—Tho' now we see him not, yet believ∣ing we rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</Q> O the unsearchable Riches of a Pardon!</P>
<P N="2">2. So likewise of <HI>sanctifying Grace.</HI> By Nature we are now <HI>shapen</HI> and <HI>born</HI> in <HI>Sin,</HI> in a misera∣ble <HI>Bondage</HI> to it, and <HI>Pollution</HI> from it. It is the mysterious Work of God to change and <HI>renew</HI> the Soul. It confounded the <HI>Master in Israel</HI> to hear of the Necessity of the <HI>New-Brith</HI> But un∣searchable must the Price be of a <HI>renewed Heart and Mind:</HI> to have God's <HI>Image</HI> restored in us! To be made <HI>Partakers</HI> of his Holiness! From <HI>Slaves</HI> to Satan to become the <HI>Servants</HI> of God! and his holy <HI>Temples</HI> who were the Habitations of every <HI>unclean Lust!</HI> To have our <HI>blind</HI> Eyes o∣pened! Our <HI>hard</HI> Hearts softned! Our <HI>depraved</HI> Affections purified! Our <HI>desiled</HI> Consciences pur∣ged! The <HI>Law</HI> of Gof <HI>written</HI> in us, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God <HI>dwelling</HI> in us! To have <HI>Christ formed</HI> in us, the Flesh crucified, the <HI>Spirit of Life</HI> acting us, Grace <HI>Growing</HI> in us, the <HI>Life of Jesus</HI> exhibited in this mortal Flesh, which naturally is in vile Subjection to Sin. O what does the great GOD work <HI>in</HI> and <HI>for</HI> the Souls of his <HI>Chosen in Christ!</HI> A Work marvellous and glorious as Man's first Creation in the Image of God! For in this new Creation there also is commanded <HI>Light</HI> out of Darkness, <HI>Order</HI> and Beauty out of a <HI>Chaos</HI> of Confusion and Emptiness.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHO can search out <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the <HI>eter∣nal Life by Jesus Christ, Salvation with eternal
<PB N="96" REF="004489_0103_100D30E0973DC0B8"/>Glory!</HI> This is the <HI>Promise</HI> which he has promised; the <HI>Purchase</HI> of his Death, and the <HI>Gift</HI> of God thro' him. He has begotten us unto this <HI>lively Hopen</HI> by his Resurrection from the dead, and As∣cention to Heaven; and thither <HI>where he is</HI> will he gather his Redeemed, and they shall <HI>behold his Glory,</HI> and be glorify'd with him. But what this future and heavenly Glory is, is to us unsearcha∣ble. Now are we the <HI>Sons</HI> of GOD, if we believe in CHRIST the <HI>only-begotten Son,</HI> but it doth not appear what we shall be; only we know that we shall be <HI>like him,</HI> (inexpressibly Blessed in him) for we shall <HI>see him as he is.</HI></P>
<P>READ over the <HI>Descriptions</HI> given us of the heavenly Felicity, and think <HI>what is the Hope of our Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints,</HI> Eph. 1.18. It is an Inheritance <HI>in Light: Incorruptible</HI> and <HI>Undefiled:</HI> A <HI>Crown</HI> of Glory that fadeth not away: A far exceeding and eternal <HI>Weight</HI> of Glory: A <HI>Ful∣ness of Joy</HI> in the Presence of God, and <HI>Pleasures</HI> at his right Hand for evermore: Infinite and e∣verlasting <HI>Happiness.</HI> We must comprehend GOD and Eternity, his Glory and Bliss, before we can conceive of all the Benefits of Christ. These <HI>Riches in Glory</HI> are past the Power of <HI>Numbers</HI> to cast up; they are past all Account or Reckoning: When we have risen to Millions of Millions, and Often multiplied them, there are the same Num∣bers yet behind. The Benefits of Redemption have no <HI>Compass</HI> short of the infinite and eternal GOD. They are <HI>Immense</HI> like Him, <HI>wide</HI> as the Heavens, deep and long as <HI>Eternity!</HI> Things nei∣ther <HI>lawful</HI> nor <HI>possible</HI> to be spoken.</P>

IV. UNSEARCHABLY great and glorious is the <HI>Administration of the Kingdom of Grace, and GOD's gracious Working on the Souls of Sinners by and with the Dispensation of his Word and ordinances.</HI> We <HI>sce</HI> the glorious Effect wro't, we <HI>feel</HI> the en∣liv'ning refreshing Gale blow: The Thing is <HI>sensible,</HI> the Manner incomprehensible. John 3. 9. <HI>The Wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the Sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> He works arbitrarily, power∣fully, mysteriously. Unaccountable it is—<HI>where,</HI> in <HI>whom, when,</HI> and in what <HI>manner</HI> he pleases to work. The <HI>Breathings</HI> of the HOLY SPIRIT are like the <HI>Wind</HI> upon us, both in respect of the <HI>Freeness</HI> and <HI>Variableness</HI> of its Motion. GOD blows out of his <HI>Treasuries</HI> upon us, from what <HI>Quarter,</HI> in what <HI>Measure,</HI>with what <HI>Continuance,</HI> with what <HI>Intermissions,</HI> with what <HI>Changes, more or less,</HI> as he pleases. <Q>It is very <HI>secret</HI> and ex∣ceeding <HI>various</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Burkitt.</NOTE>. Various in the <HI>Method</HI> of working; some wro't upon by the <HI>Corrosives</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> others by the <HI>Lenitives</HI> of the <HI>Gos∣pel.</HI> Various in the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Means;</HI> on some by a powerful <HI>Odinance,</HI> on others by an awakening <HI>Providence.</HI> Yet the Work is <HI>one</HI> in all, the Effect the same, <HI>scil.</HI> Conformity to GOD, his holy Nature, and revealed Will, in Heart and Life.</Q></P>
<P>REGENERATION is the <HI>Riches of CHRIST.</HI> It is <HI>Christ formed</HI> in us: The <HI>Spirit of Christ</HI> given
<PB N="98" REF="004489_0105_100D582503199828"/>to us: The <HI>lmage</HI> of Christ restor'd in us. He has <HI>purchas'd</HI> this invaluable Gift for us: It is the <HI>Spirit of the Son</HI> sent forth into our Hearts; the <HI>Comforter whom 1 will send</HI>—said our ascending <HI>Saviour; be shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you:</HI> the <HI>Graces,</HI> the <HI>Comforts,</HI> the <HI>Glory</HI> which I have <HI>purchased</HI> for you, he shall <HI>produce</HI> in you, and <HI>prepare</HI> you for.</P>
<P>BUT to be more <HI>particular:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is the Administration of the Kingdom of Grace, <HI>in God's sending the Gospel to some and not to others; to one Country and Na∣tion and not to another.</HI> It was altogether sove∣reign and unaccountable, that first <HI>Abraham</HI> should be singled out from an <HI>idolatrous World,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> be shut up within the narrow Walls of his <HI>House,</HI> which by a Covenant of Peculiarity and <HI>Circumcision,</HI> as by a Wall of <HI>Partition,</HI> was se∣parated from the rest of the World, for so many Ages and Generations. And now that the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> are <HI>Fellow-Heirs</HI> and Partakers of the Promise in Christ by the Gospel, it is the unsearchable Conduct of divine Grace to leave great <HI>Empires,</HI> and vast <HI>Territories</HI> of the Earth in the Darkness of Nature and without a <HI>Revelation:</HI> to use the <HI>Words</HI> of Scripture,—<HI>without GOD</HI> in the World, <HI>aliens</HI> to the Covenant of Promise, <HI>afar off and without Hope;</HI> while other Places and People are <HI>made nigh,</HI> bro't near, and exalted high in spiri∣tual Privileges.</P>
<P>WHAT a dark and melancholly Mystery is it, in Providence and in Grace, that so great a part
<PB N="99" REF="004489_0106_100D58269F5E0B68"/>of the known Earth is at this Day perishing in <HI>Pagan Idolatries,</HI> serving <HI>dumb Idols</HI> even as they are blindly led by <HI>Satan?</HI> Again, that so great a part of it lies sunk under the <HI>Mahometan Im∣posture?</HI> and so great a part of <HI>Christendom</HI> also in the <HI>Romish</HI> Superstitions and Abominations? And why to <HI>us</HI> in these <HI>remote Regions</HI> should the <HI>Truth and Worship</HI> of GOD be sent, and preserved <HI>pure?</HI> A Mercy deny'd to <HI>Millions</HI> better than we! Why these <HI>late barbarous and salvage</HI> Places of the Earth be <HI>illuminated,</HI> and honoured to become the <HI>visible Kingdom of Christ,</HI> while the <HI>noble Em∣pires of the East, China</HI> and others, are left in their deplorable Ignorance!</P>
<P>IT is not that we are <HI>greater</HI> or better than they, as was said to <HI>Israel</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI> when they were chosen, called and separated from the World: but altogether of the sovereign and unsearchable Will, Wisdom and Grace of GOD. As of old it was with the <HI>Seed of Abraham;</HI> not <HI>all</HI> of them were alike <HI>adopted;</HI> but in <HI>Isaac</HI> was his <HI>Seed cal∣led:</HI> And again, when <HI>Rebecca had conceived, the Children not being yet born; neither having done either Good or Evil, that the Purpose of GOD ac∣cording to Election might stand, not of Works, but of him that calleth, it was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger; Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated,</HI> Rom. 9.10,—13. And what shall we say to this, save to adore the Sovereignty of the divine Will! As he saith to <HI>Moses,</HI> <Q>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have Compassion on whom I will have Compassion!</Q> <HI>To show his Wrath and to make his Power known,</HI> he rejects <HI>Places</HI> as well as <HI>Persons,
<PB N="100" REF="004489_0107_100D582A2AF642B0"/>fitted for Destruction,</HI> like the <HI>Cananites</HI> of old; and again to <HI>make known the Riches of his Mercy</HI> on those whom he hath ordained unto <HI>Glory,</HI> e∣ven <Q>us whom he hath called of the Gentiles; as he saith in Osee, I will call them my People which were not my People, and her beloved which was not beloved: And it is come to pass that in the Place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my People, there are they called the Children of the living GOD.</Q> In this <HI>Me∣ditation</HI> it is, even of the <HI>Riches</HI> of the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, by the <HI>Fall and Diminishing of the Jews,</HI> that the <HI>Apostle</HI> crys out, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.33. <Q>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of GOD! how unsearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the LORD, or being his Counsellor hath taught him?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE it is <HI>that the same Means enjoy'd by many, are so efficacious upon some and not on others.</HI> The divine <HI>Election and Purpose</HI> of Merey makes here the like wonderful Difference between <HI>Persons,</HI> in respect of <HI>internal Efficocy,</HI> as the divine <HI>Providence</HI> does any where in respect of <HI>outward Call and Privilege.</HI> And the same <HI>Words</HI> us'd in <HI>that Case,</HI> are meant and applied in this too by the HOLY GHOST. It is not of him that <HI>wilieth,</HI> nor of him that <HI>runneth,</HI> but of GOD that sheweth Mercy. There is the same <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> in one and all, the same natural <HI>Enmity</HI> and Opposition to the almighty Grace of GOD, the same <HI>Inability</HI> both to <HI>will</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> in one and another: there is the same <HI>Guiltiness</HI> by Na∣ture, and very often more <HI>increas'd</HI> by vicious
<PB N="101" REF="004489_0108_100D582C4C99D480"/>Practice, where the divine <HI>Election</HI> is shown after all. We little know where GOD <HI>means to work;</HI> but it is often there where Man least expects, and where our Desires and Prayers have been less ex∣press. Nor is it more admirable to any than to the happy <HI>Vessels of Mercy</HI> themselves, to find themselves singled out when sometimes they cou'd least of all have look'd for it: As the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> was full of <HI>Adorations</HI> that he shou'd be called to <HI>preach</HI> the unsearchable Riches of Christ, in the very Heat and Act of his fierce Opposition to, and Persecution of the Name of <HI>JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>IN short:</P>
<P>THERE is an Excellency of Power and Sove∣reignty in these Things, that we may admire GOD in his free and <HI>effectual Calling whom he will,</HI> and <HI>working what,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> and <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>where</HI> he will. He <HI>divideth</HI> to every Man severally as he will, and hath <HI>Mercy</HI> on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he <HI>hardneth.</HI> To some of the same Congregation it is given to <HI>know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> to others it <HI>is not given.</HI> Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own Will begat be us by the Word of Truth.</HI> He cou'd of the same <HI>Mass</HI> of Pollution, and from the same <HI>Quarry of Stones,</HI> have raised up other Children to <HI>Abraham;</HI> yet here and not there have the <HI>purifying</HI> and <HI>softning Dews</HI> of the Word fell and abode, or the <HI>rending Flashes</HI> of it struck, and not there. Eph. 2.1,—7. <Q>And you hath he quickned who were dead in Trespasses and Sins: wherein in time past ye walked according to the Course of this World—: Among whom also we all had our
<PB N="102" REF="004489_0109_100D582DD2F98F28"/>Conversation in time past, in the Lusts of our Flesh, fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh and Mind, and were by Nature the Children of Wrath even as others: But GOD who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he lo∣ved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — For by Grace ye are saved, thro' Faith, and that not of your selves, it is the Gift of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY <HI>Saint</HI> may look in upon <HI>himself,</HI> if he perce ves a saving Change wro't in him, and say, <HI>LORD, why me?</HI> And every <HI>Minister</HI> or obser∣ving <HI>Christian</HI> will find frequent Reason to ad∣mire with respect to <HI>others,</HI> and say (not from <HI>Complaint,</HI> but full of humble <HI>Adoration) Why here</HI> (blessed GOD) <HI>and not there!</HI> Why on <HI>this</HI> Soul, and not on <HI>that! Even so Father, because it pleases thee! O that Ishmael also might live in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is <HI>the Diversity of the Ways and Manner whereby</HI> it pleases GOD to work sa∣vingly on the Souls of Men. These are <HI>many,</HI> and all <HI>mysterious,</HI> comparing the <HI>Means</HI> in them∣selves unto the Glory and Greatness of the <HI>Effect.</HI> It is the Glory of GOD to use the <HI>smallest</HI> Means, to the most <HI>illustrious</HI> Effect; and sometimes to bring about his own <HI>great Ends</HI> by <HI>ways</HI> seeming∣ly <HI>cross</HI> thereunto; that so his Hand may be the more <HI>signal,</HI> and the Event the more <HI>surprizing.</HI> As the <HI>Heavens</HI> are higher than the Earth, so are his <HI>Tho'ts</HI> above ours. The <HI>Variety</HI> here is plea∣sant to contemplate, working with the most sweet <HI>Harmony</HI> to one blessed End. The Heart of <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="004489_0110_100D582F66CE5B50"/>is <HI>softly opened,</HI> sweetly dilated and quickned by the <HI>silent</HI> Breath of the Almighty: Another is <HI>prick'd to the Heart,</HI> has his Conscience <HI>gash'd,</HI> and lies in <HI>Agonies</HI> of Spirit. Sometimes a <HI>Word</HI> does either of them; sometimes a <HI>gracious Providence</HI> the one, and an <HI>awakening Affliction</HI> the other. He worketh <HI>severally as he willeth.</HI> To name a <HI>few of his Ways,—And how little a Portion is heard of him!</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT is of the unsearchable Riches of Grace <HI>that the Foolishness of Preaching should save any.</HI> This the <HI>Apostle</HI> amplifies on as a strange but no∣torious thing; the Effect and the Means not at all proportionate, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 18,—21. It is the Won∣der of the World, that the Doctrine of a <HI>crucified Saviour,</HI> and of the <HI>Cross</HI> to be taken up by his Disciples, should ever prevail over the Hearts of Men; their Hearts opposite to the <HI>Shames</HI> of the one, and to the <HI>Pains</HI> of the other! And that the <HI>naked Proposal</HI> of this divine Doctrine by Men of no Learning or Influence should so Triumph o∣ver the Prejudices, Superstitions and Customs of People. Yea, the daily Efficacy of the preached Gospel, is to our own Times a living lasting Wonder.</P>
<P>CAN <HI>we</HI> speak to the <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, or can we reach their <HI>Hearts?</HI> And very often can the <HI>in∣ferior Preacher?</HI> (whose <HI>Sermons</HI> and <HI>Composures</HI> are in the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and Judgment of <HI>Man</HI> yet more <HI>Foolishness) who</HI> yet is used by God most of all to <HI>enter</HI> into the Souls of Sinners! 2 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>For we have this Treasure in earthen Vessels, that the
<PB N="104" REF="004489_0111_100D58319685A7D0"/>Excellency of the Power may be of GOD, and not of us.</HI></P>
<P>IT pleases GOD for his own Glory to put a pre∣cious <HI>Treasure</HI> in his poor <HI>Ministers,</HI> and to display his <HI>own Power</HI> in their weak Administrations. There is an <HI>Excellency</HI> of Power display'd in <HI>con∣vincing</HI> and <HI>humbling</HI> the Souls of Sinners, in <HI>en∣lightning,</HI> purifying and <HI>sanctifying</HI> them; in the <HI>Mortification</HI> of Sin and Lust in them, and in the <HI>Dominion</HI> of Grace upon its Expulsion. There is an Excellency of Power in reaching the Hearts and Consciencies of Men, and in a manifest <HI>Em∣pire</HI> over the <HI>Thought</HI> and <HI>Will, Mind</HI> and <HI>Affec∣tions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHO is sufficient for these Things?</HI> What Means or Instruments <HI>equal</HI> to them? Truly none: yet how easily is it all effected by the poor Labours of <HI>weak Men,</HI> ordained and blessed of GOD hereunto? The <HI>Effect</HI> equally wonderful if you thro'ly consider it, as when <HI>the Waters divi∣ded</HI> against their Nature and Course at the Word of <HI>Elisha!</HI> Or as when the <HI>Midian Army</HI> was routed before the blast of a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> and the Lamps in their <HI>earthen Pitchers.</HI> Or as when the <HI>great Syrian Leper</HI> was cleansed by <HI>dipping</HI> in the Waters of <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>AND since I have nam'd <HI>him,</HI> let it be the <HI>In∣stance</HI> for the <HI>illustrating</HI> this <HI>Head.</HI> A little <HI>Israelite Girl</HI> was the first Means toward the clean∣sing this <HI>noble Syrian:</HI> but when he came to the <HI>Prophet,</HI> and was bid to <HI>go and wash himself seven times</HI> in the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> how did he <HI>despise</HI> the
<PB N="105" REF="004489_0112_100D5833CC37BB38"/>thing? How did he pet and storm at the Direc∣tion of Heaven? Were there not as <HI>good Rivers in Syria</HI> for him to have washed at? Had the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> any natural Virtue more than <HI>those?</HI> No, no more than the Lips of <HI>Ministers,</HI> or their Preaching has in it self a Power to purify the Heart. Yet was it soon found that the <HI>ordained Waters,</HI> like those of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> had the di∣vine <HI>healing Power</HI> and <HI>Blessing</HI> with them: the <HI>Leper's Flesh</HI> was restored like a <HI>new-born Child,</HI> or a <HI>ruddy Youth</HI>'s for Purity and Beauty; he was a <HI>new Creature,</HI> as one <HI>form'd</HI> and <HI>born</HI> anew: He admir'd the wondrous <HI>Renovation,</HI> ador'd the Power and Mercy of GOD in the Change wro't, declar'd that there is <HI>no GOD beside him</HI> in all the Earth, would needs have some of the <HI>consecra∣ted Earth of Israel</HI> to build an <HI>Altar</HI> in his own Country, and vow'd that he wou'd never worship or do sacrifice to any dumb <HI>Idol</HI> of <HI>Syria</HI> any more. Truly the Ordinances of the <HI>Gospel</HI> are as won∣derful in their Effects upon the Soul, as the Wa∣ters of <HI>Israel</HI> were in their Effects upon the Body of <HI>Naaman.</HI> John 15.3. <HI>Now are ye clean thro' the Word that I have spoken to you.</HI> Heb. 4.12, 13. Psal. 45.3, 5. 1 Cor. 1.21,—28.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Operations of the divine Grace on our Souls by particular Providences, both merciful and afflictive,</HI> are equally unsearchable. <HI>These</HI> in themselves are equally <HI>ineffectual,</HI> as thousands do experience, as the <HI>Teachings out of GOD's Law.</HI> Both Mercies and Judgments are lost on Multi∣tudes. Yet <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> GOD pleases to work by either, they have (both one and other) an ir∣resistible Constraint; the <HI>one</HI> to allure and draw
<PB N="106" REF="004489_0113_100D5835EB0D9370"/>and bind the Soul by the Bands of Love, the <HI>other</HI> to compel and force and drive us to GOD, not <HI>a∣gainst</HI> the Will, but by a potent <HI>Conquest</HI> &amp; turn∣ing of it.</P>
<P>UNSEARCHABLE are the <HI>Purposes</HI> of Mercy, and the evident <HI>Proofs</HI> thereof in the End, in ma∣ny <HI>terrible Dispensations</HI> of Providence to parti∣cular <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Families.</HI> The greatest out∣ward <HI>Rebukes</HI> prove not seldom the greatest spiri∣tual Mercies, and <HI>surest Consolations</HI> of their Lives. However Nature may groan and cry out under the <HI>Operation,</HI> yet the Life and Health of the Soul is graciously consulted, and marvellously com∣passed. We often see People <HI>take on</HI> grievously now, at those things which they will rejoice in for ever, with <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> All <HI>that</HI> seems sadly <HI>against them,</HI> which is making marvellously for their <HI>everlasting good.</HI></P>
<P>IN what Anguish cry'd the poor <HI>Mother</HI> to the <HI>Prophet, O Man of GOD! art thou come to call my Sins to remembrance, and to stay my Son?</HI> Ah, blessed <HI>Mean</HI> of a more effectual Calling her Sins to Remembrance, and working her up unto a more full Repentance, and a future Life of more Faith in GOD, and Devotedness unto him. <HI>Heaven</HI> will unriddle many of the dark Works of GOD's Grace now.</P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Conduct of divine Grace in making the very <HI>Sins</HI> of Men, and their <HI>foul Falls</HI> into Sin, to be the <HI>Occasion</HI> very often, and <HI>effectual Means</HI> of their Conversion and Sal∣vation Happy the Sinner that is bro't to see the
<PB N="107" REF="004489_0114_100D583789ED2EF8"/><HI>Sinfulness</HI> of Sin, and his <HI>own</HI> exceeding <HI>Vileness.</HI> But it is a melancholy Way to Conviction, by some <HI>Over-Wickedness</HI> to raise a hideous Guilt, to <HI>glare</HI> us in the Face, and fright us to our Knees. <Q>By <HI>one</HI> Sin breaking out GOD often discovers to a Person <HI>more</HI> Sin in himself; as if you stir a Pool of Water the Mud and Filth of the Bot∣tom rises and shews it self.</Q> Conscience is made <HI>tender</HI> by its Wound, and <HI>watchful</HI> by its Fall and Bruise. GOD sometimes mercifully <HI>shames</HI> Souls into a saving Humiliation by a serious Re∣flection on their Scandals; they see their own Deformity in the Glass of <HI>GOD's Word,</HI> and are covered with Blushes and deep Confusion before GOD and Man. They are <HI>frighted</HI> to see their own Faces, and <HI>asham'd</HI> to be seen of others. From loathing a <HI>particular Fact</HI> they come to the loath∣ing all <HI>Manner of Sin,</HI> as such. <HI>I have sinned,</HI> said <HI>David,</HI> and into what a glorious Exercise of Repentance did it cast him? <HI>Psal.</HI> 51. <HI>Peter</HI> by his Fall learn'd <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> and so gain'd a future <HI>Stability. Paul</HI> doubled his Industry and Adorations of GOD, when he remembred his old <HI>persecuting the Saints.</HI> No Good can possibly be in Sin, and yet saving Good is bro't out of it. Ma∣ny a Saint looking unto Means must be forc'd to say—<HI>I had perish'd if I had never fell heinously.</HI> The <HI>Blow</HI> that might have <HI>stunn'd</HI> Persons, or <HI>dash'd</HI> 'em to Pieces, has sometimes thro' Grace only <HI>awakened</HI> them out of their previous <HI>Stupor,</HI> and Security in Sin. O the Riches of Grace to such a Soul! by plunging in the <HI>Ditch</HI> so that his own Cloaths have <HI>abhorr'd</HI> him, he came to see his <HI>Pollution</HI> and need of Cleansing.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="108" REF="004489_0115_100D583AA314AAC8"/>
4. And lastly, UNSEARCHABLE is the Method of Grace also in making the <HI>great Temptations, Assaults and Terrors of Satan,</HI> not seldom the Means of the Conversion and Salvation of them that suffer by 'em. The <HI>Purgatory</HI> (I may say) thro' which <HI>elect and chosen Vessels</HI> are often made to pass, and by which they are <HI>refined</HI> and prepa∣red for Glory. It looks all to be of <HI>Wrath,</HI> and the Blackness or Flames of <HI>Hell</HI> about the Soul; but in the End it is found full of the In∣tention of <HI>Love</HI> and utmost <HI>Compassion.</HI> As were the kind and <HI>tender Tho'ts</HI> of Heaven to <HI>holy Job,</HI> while the <HI>Devil</HI> for his <HI>Trial</HI> and Increase of Grace had Permission to fright and scare him.</P>
<P>HOW mysterious is it to see <HI>gracious Persons</HI> annoy'd with impure, diabolical, cursed, blasphe∣mous Tho'ts, which they loath and detest, and fly from; but are <HI>haunted</HI> and pursued by, as by some hideous <HI>Spectre</HI> or <HI>unclean Spirit,</HI> which terrifies because it seems to pollute them. It looks to them even as <HI>Satan's Possession</HI> of them, when indeed it is the Means of his utter <HI>Ejection,</HI> and of the souls being cleans'd and <HI>swept</HI> from all Impurity and Defilement, and becoming a <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Man∣sion</HI> for the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>hellish Assaults</HI> have often driven Souls to <HI>Christ,</HI> the impregnable <HI>Reck:</HI> these foul <HI>Sug∣gestions</HI> have left no <HI>Ordure of Hell</HI> behind them; but bro't the poor Soul to see and loath its natu∣ral Pollution and Defilement, and hastned its Flight to the <HI>open Fountain</HI> for Cleansing in the Blood of <HI>Christ.</HI> These <HI>cursed Blasphemics,</HI> hated as they are to the suffering Heart, have only fix'd
<PB N="109" REF="004489_0116_100D583CCCB15420"/>and raised it in the Reverence and Love of GOD, and in the Spirit of Devotion. These <HI>Amaze∣ments</HI> and <HI>Disquiets</HI> have only establish'd the Soul in a <HI>sober Fear,</HI> and a composed, humble, watch∣ful, prayerful, steddy Course of <HI>Obedience</HI> &amp; <HI>Trust</HI> in GOD.</P>
<P>IT is in the Works of <HI>Grace</HI> as it is in those of Providence: As <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Sorrows and <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Suf∣ferings were but the wise and happy Means of their future Honour, Safety and Comfort; so is the Malice and Envy, the Rage and Fury of <HI>Sa∣tan,</HI> and the inexpressible Sufferings of Souls there∣from, often the sure Means of their eternal Sal∣vation, Felicity and Glory. We may apply in this Case that Exhortation and Consolation: <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 28. <Q>And in nothing terrified by your Ad∣versaries, which is to them an evident Token of Perdition, but to you of Salvation, and that of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>THUS GOD has many <HI>mysterious Ways</HI> where∣by to work savingly on the Souls of Sinners. May we but <HI>Experience</HI> any, even the darkest, of these Ways of divine Mercy, that we know how to <HI>adore</HI> GOD therein and <HI>magnify his Work;</HI> and that the <HI>exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kind∣ness to us thro' JesusChrist</HI> may be exemplify'd and admir'd for ever in us.</P>
<P>I am now arriv'd unto the <HI>last Head</HI> propound∣ed, which is,</P>
<P N="5">V. UNSEARCHABLE are the <HI>divine Persections</HI> shining forth in the <HI>Work of Redemption.</HI> The

<P N="1">1. UNSEARCHABLE is the WISDOM of GOD in the great Work of our <HI>Redemotion.</HI> The <HI>ma∣nifold</HI> Wisdom of GOD made known in <HI>Christ. Treasures</HI> of Wisdom and Knowledge are <HI>hid</HI> in him, and in him <HI>bro't to Light.</HI> The <HI>Riches of Understanding</HI> is requisite to the <HI>Acknowledgment of the Mystery of the Father, and of Christ.</HI> How vast the <HI>Stores</HI> of the most precious and <HI>enriching</HI> Knowledge! salutary and <HI>saving</HI> Knowledge! of the last Necessity and Efficacy to make us <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>this Work</HI> of Redemption GOD is said to have <HI>abounded to us in all Wisdom and Prudence.</HI> In <HI>all</HI> his Works <HI>much</HI> of his Wisdom appears, in <HI>this</HI> it abounds. That Justice and Mercy, Righteous∣ness and Peace, Truth and Grace shou'd be bro't to meet and unite in our Redemption! "The most different <HI>Interests</HI> be reconcil'd, the most di∣stant <HI>Ends</HI> accomplish'd; and in the <HI>untho't of,</HI> yet most <HI>perfect.</HI> Way that can be!

<P>HOW <HI>wonderful</HI> a REDEEMER has GOD pro∣vided for us? How suitable a <HI>Mediator</HI> between

Here is a more admirable Work of GOD in the <HI>Person</HI> of Christ, than in all Angels and all Men put to∣gether! A more astonishing Effect in one Life and Death, than in the laying the Foundations of the Earth, or than the spreading forth the Hea∣vens over us. Such an <HI>High-Priest became us,</HI> who should be so near to us, and yet as near to GOD; cloathed in our <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and yet array'd in the <HI>Glories</HI> of the GODHEAD.</P>

<P N="2">2 UNSEARCHABLE is the POWER of GOD dis∣play'd in the Work of our <HI>Redemption.</HI> CHRIST <HI>the Power of GOD, and the Wisdom of GOD,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.24. The <HI>Mighty GOD</HI> and the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> are One. Our Salvation was a <HI>mighty Work</HI> to undertake and perform: to bear the Wrath of the infinite GOD for us! to make Attonement
<PB N="112" REF="004489_0119_100D584266DDB118"/>for our Sins, and to bring in an everlasting Righ∣teousness for us! to overturn the Kingdom and Power of Satan, to bestow sanctifying Grace and eternal Life! The whole Work of our Redemp∣tion from first to last, both in the <HI>Impetration</HI> and <HI>Application</HI> of it, is a Work of unsearchable Power. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 10. <Q>And what is the exceed∣ing Greatness of his Power us-ward, who be∣lieve, according to the Working of his mighty Power, which he wro't in Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> What was so blasphemously said by the deluded People of <HI>Simon the Sorcerer,</HI> is religiously to be ascrib'd to CHRIST, and to Him only, <HI>This Man is the great Power of GOD.</HI></P>

The naked Doctrines of the <HI>Cross</HI> were preached,
<PB N="113" REF="004489_0120_100D58462C439E88"/>no <HI>inticing</HI> Words of Man's Wisdom used, the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of the Schools and the <HI>Idolatries</HI> of the Nations were decried, Mens <HI>Lust</HI> sorbidden and condemned, the Mortification of the <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Self-Denial</HI> were requir'd, and in spite of the Rage of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and Contempt of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> this holy Doctrine establish'd it self, <HI>in Demonstration of the Spirit and of Power.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word: The same Power that command∣ed the <HI>Light to shine out of Darkness,</HI> shines into and illuminates the Sinner's Heart. The same Power that <HI>raiseth the dead</HI> quickens them that are <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> The same Power that smote and broke the <HI>Rock</HI> softens the <HI>stony</HI> Hearts of Sinners. The Power that <HI>divided the Sea,</HI> turns the Sinner's Heart against the Violence of natural Inclination. The Power that gave <HI>Sampson</HI> his wondrous Strength to drive the Armies of <HI>Philistines</HI> and slay <HI>Heaps upon Heaps;</HI> to <HI>snap asunder</HI> the strongest <HI>Cords,</HI> to pluck up and bear away the <HI>City Gates,</HI> and to bow together the mighty <HI>Pillars</HI> of a vast Fabrick; the same divine Power (and a greater) is it that arms a Soul a∣gainst its own <HI>Lusts,</HI> and the Worlds <HI>Temptations</HI> and the <HI>Legions</HI> of Hell; that breaks the <HI>native</HI> Dominion and inveterate <HI>Habits</HI> of Sin, and <HI>pulls down its strong Holds.</HI> Look not on <HI>Men</HI> in your Amazement at these Things, as the wondring People once did on the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as if by any Power or Virtue of <HI>theirs</HI> these Things are done; No, <HI>GOD has glorified his Son JESUS,</HI> and this is His Power whereby he subdues all Things to him∣self.</P>

3. UNSEARCHABLE is the HOLINESS and JU∣STICE of GOD in the Work of our <HI>Redemption.</HI> The infinite <HI>Sanctity</HI> of GOD has more shone forth in the Satisfaction for Sin in the Death of Christ, than even in the Severity of the Law con∣demning and threatning it. Herein eminently is the <HI>LORD of Hests exalted in Judgment, and GOD that is Holy is sanctified in Righteousness.</HI> What <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin, and <HI>Vengeance</HI> against it, appears in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the Son of GOD, and his shedding his precious Blood? A <HI>Life</HI> worth more than the Blood of <HI>all Men,</HI> and the Life of <HI>Myriads of Angels</HI> added to them! Where does GOD appear so <HI>glorious in Holiness,</HI> so irreconcile∣able to Sin, and so full of the Detestation of it, as in this <HI>Demand</HI> of his Justice, and <HI>Oblation</HI> to it. That Holiness <HI>might not</HI> suffer, CHRIST did: ra∣ther than <HI>spare</HI> Sin GOD <HI>spared not</HI> his own Son, and was inexorable to the <HI>strong Crying and Tears</HI> of his everlasting Love.</P>
<P>THE Glory of <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> together was the <HI>End</HI> of our Saviour's Death; the glorious Design &amp; <HI>Fruit</HI> of Redemption. HE, the <HI>HOLY ONE</HI> of GOD, sanctifies whom he saves. The <HI>Faith</HI> in Him that justifies us, <HI>purifies</HI> us also. The <HI>Elect</HI> are chosen in Him unto Sanctification, and called to be <HI>Saints.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT will not GOD <HI>sacrifice</HI> to the Honour of his <HI>Holiness!</HI> What <HI>Myriads</HI> of apostate An∣gels! What <HI>Worlds</HI> of impenitent Sinners! What are <HI>these</HI> compared with the Offering of his <HI>own Son?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="004489_0122_100D5849DA23ECD0"/>
I need not add:</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the divine GRACE and MERCY are Unsearchable in the Work of Redemption. The Height and Depth of the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD herein ex∣pressed <HI>passeth Knowledge.</HI> It is his <HI>great Love wherewith he loved us:</HI> to the <HI>Praise of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>GOODNESS</HI> was the <HI>Spring</HI> of our Redemp∣tion: the <HI>Motive</HI> to it was <HI>meer Love:</HI> the <HI>Bene∣fits</HI> thereof are an infinite <HI>Variety</HI> of eternal Mer∣cy. It was <HI>free Grace</HI> against Desert: the <HI>Riches</HI> of Grace to supply our infinite Wants: <HI>Distin∣guishing</HI> Mercy that regarded us when it passed by <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is but a very transient and general <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>unsearchable Glories</HI> of the <HI>divine Perfections,</HI> shining forth in the Work of Redemption. Let us <HI>pause</HI> here and recollect, what unspeakable Things GOD has done for it! What inestimable Treasures he has expended on it! What un∣searchable Things he has provided in CHRIST for poor Sinners! What has he not given <HI>for</HI> us, what has he not given <HI>to</HI> us! It surmounts all Tho't, surpasses all Conception and Admiration! We can never in any equal or fitting Manner adore, praise, extol the Mercies and <HI>Benignity</HI> of our gracious GOD toward us Cou'd we Think with all the Swistness and Intenseness of Angels, and speak with their Tongues, and should we spend our whole Life here and Eternity hereafter, in looking into and magnifying the divine Wisdom, Power, Holiness and Mercy in our Redemption, yet at last it were <HI>ineffable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="004489_0123_100D584C5B9B2768"/>
LET us <HI>reflect</HI> on what hath been said, &amp; <HI>infer:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE incomprehensible Glory of our SAVIOUR.</HI> His Glory is <HI>great</HI> in our Salvation; <HI>Honour and Majesty</HI> does it put upon him: it declares him <HI>most Blessed</HI> for ever: His Name shall continue <HI>as the Sun;</HI> and Men shall be blessed <HI>in him;</HI> all Na∣tions shall <HI>call him Blessed.</HI> His Dignity and Ex∣cellency, Merits and Benefits fill the whole Earth with his Glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Reproach of the</HI> CROSS <HI>ceaseth.</HI> A Glory dwells upon it: The <HI>King of Glory</HI> hung upon it. No more let it be called the <HI>cursed Tree,</HI> but the <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> like <HI>that</HI> in the midst of the <HI>Paradice of GOD,</HI> yielding <HI>all manner</HI> of rich and precious <HI>Fruit.</HI> With what <HI>Garlands</HI> and <HI>Tro∣phies</HI> is the <HI>triumphant Standard</HI> hung? Yea, with <HI>Crowns of Glory</HI> for them that are not ashamed of his <HI>Reproach!</HI> Worthy to be esteemed <HI>greater Riches</HI> than the <HI>Treasures</HI> of the <HI>Indies!</HI></P>
<P>BUT when I speak of the CROSS you know how to take me right, of the <HI>meritorious Sacrifice</HI> of∣fered thereon, by our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and the <HI>most blessed Effects</HI> of that Offering. Men may magnify the <HI>material Cross</HI> to gross <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and abuse the <HI>Sign</HI> of it to <HI>Superstition;</HI> but the Virtues of a <HI>crucified Saviour,</HI> the Merits and Power of his <HI>Death,</HI> can't be too much honoured by us.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM all the incomprehensible Things al∣ready spoken of we may well infer, <HI>What is not an Interest in Christ worth?</HI> A <HI>Relation</HI> to him, a <HI>Fortion</HI> in him, a <HI>Name</HI> among his <HI>redeemed!</HI> O
<PB N="117" REF="004489_0124_100D584FD111E368"/>unsearchable Blessedness! O immense Felicity! How little do Men consider what is offer'd to 'em daily in the <HI>Tenders</HI> of Salvation! How <HI>great</HI> are the Things which we hear so carelefly of, which we so easily neglect, and set so light by? <HI>O if thou knewest the Gift of GOD!</HI> GOD forgive us our <HI>Madness</HI> and <HI>Frenzy,</HI> for <HI>we know not what we do.</HI> That when the Offers of Salvation by CHRIST are daily made to us, and we are pray'd in his Name to accept of the great Redemption thro' him, yet we despise it as if it were the most mi∣nute, contemptible, despicable Thing! The mean∣est <HI>Trash</HI> and <HI>Dung</HI> in our Way! Whereas <HI>all Things</HI> should be so to us for the <HI>Excellency</HI> here∣of!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>SEE the Guilt and Sin of Unbelief and Im∣penitence under the Gospel.</HI> What a high Indigni∣ty and Provocation is it to redeeming Mercy! A most astonishing <HI>Baseness</HI> as well as Madness! That when the <HI>immense Grace</HI> of GOD is revealed to us, it should be but as a <HI>Pearl</HI> cast before <HI>Swine,</HI> who are ready to <HI>crucify afresh,</HI> to <HI>turn</HI> again and <HI>rend</HI> the Son of GOD. <Q>Our Slight of a <HI>Saviour</HI> is (as Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> expresses it) a Sin of that tran∣scendent Height, that all the Abominations of <HI>Sodom</HI> are not equal to it. It exasperates <HI>Mercy</HI> it self, that dear and tender <HI>Attribute,</HI> the on∣ly Advocate in GOD's Bosom for us. It is to strike at the Heart, and kick at the Bowels of a <HI>Saviour.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5">5. LET what we have heard <HI>beget in us the highest Confidence and Trust in Christ as an alsuffi∣cient Saviour.</HI> He is able to <HI>supply</HI> all our Needs,
<PB N="118" REF="004489_0125_100D5851580EB100"/>and to do for us beyond all that we can <HI>ask</HI> or <HI>think.</HI> Nothing is too great for him to do; no∣thing can be wanting in him. There are no Bounds to be set, how far he can pardon &amp; save; <Q>He is able to save unto the uttermost all that come unto GOD by him.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6, And lastly, LET us <HI>learn Humility and Mo∣desly in our Researches into the deep Things of GOD,</HI> and let us <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>adore</HI> where GOD has <HI>re∣vealed</HI> those Things which we cannot now <HI>com∣prehend. GOD is Unsearchable,</HI>—therefore we must submit to the <HI>Revelation</HI> which he makes of Himself. Our Reason is by no Means the Mea∣sure of Truth. <Q>No Man hath seen GOD at any time; the Only-Begotten of the Father he hath revealed him. The Glory of GOD is now to be seen in the Face of Jesus Christ. He that hath seen Him hath seen the Father.</Q> <HI>Our Faith must stand in the Wisdom of GOD,</HI> and his plain Declarations concerning <HI>himself,</HI> who is <HI>Truth,</HI> and who is <HI>Incomprehensible,</HI> by a Necessity of Nature.</P>
<P><Q>Now to the only-wise GOD our SAVIOUR, be Glory, and Majesty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>WORTHY is the LAMB that was slain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</Q></P>
