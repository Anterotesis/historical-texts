<HEAD>A DECLARATION of what <HI>GOD</HI> has done for our Souls.</HEAD>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To any of the Flock of Christ, that may be scattered among the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> that desire to worship God in Spirit and in Truth, and not by the Commandments and Doctrines of Men.</HEAD>
<P>WE can't find one Word in the Bible, for keeping the first Day of the Week as a Sabbath; and, therefore we have continued in earnest Prayer to God; begging of him, to direct us in his Ways, and especially concerning this pretended Sabbath; and he has taught us by his Spirit, and the Scriptures, to labour on it publickly as on other Days, and not fear what Man can do; according to the Scriptures: And when we have so laboured publickly on said pretended Sabbath, to please God, he hath shewed us plainly by his Spi∣rit, that we pleased him in so doing; and also, opened our Understanding, to understand the Scriptures. And when the Authority have been
<PB N="2" REF="008575_0002_102F870F4AE42988"/>
suffered to punish us, God hath been with us, and comforted us by his Holy Spirit; and shewed us plainly, that he that is in us, is greater than he that is in our Persecutors; as in <HI>John</HI> iv. 4. Especially in the Whippings, Imprisonments, and Spoilings of Goods, which we have endured within two Years. And this we have written, to encourage all them that God has enlightened, to see that the first Day of the Week is not his Sabbath; that they may be encouraged to take up their Cross, in this and all other Things; that he doth enlighten them by his Spirit, and the Scriptures; and <HI>not fear them which kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do: But fear him that is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell:</HI> According to <HI>Mat.</HI> x, 28, and <HI>Luke</HI> xii, 4. See also, <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi, 24, &amp;c. <HI>Then said Jesus unto his Disciples, if any Man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me: For whosoever will save his Life, shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his Life for my Sake, shall find it: For what is a Man profited if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul.</HI> Also, <HI>Mat.</HI> x, 36, &amp;c. <HI>A Man's Foes shall be those of his own Houshold. He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me: He that findeth his Life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his Life for my Sake, shall find it.</HI> Also <HI>Luke</HI> xiv, 26, <HI>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Sisters; yea, and his own Life also, he cannot be my Disciple.</HI> Thus by Christ's Testimony, we may
<PB N="3" REF="008575_0003_102F8710DD225FC0"/>
see, that if any Man will be held back from follow∣ing Christ by these worldly Things, tho' it be his own Life, he cannot be Christ's Disciple. For tho' <HI>by Grace we are saved, through Faith, and that not of ourselves, it is the Gift of God;</HI> yet by the Scriptures above quoted, and many more, if we do not take up our Cross, we shall not be worthy of this Gift. Also, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 11, 12. <HI>For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: If we deny him, he also will deny us.</HI> And whereas Christ says, <HI>he that taketh not his Cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</HI> By which we may also understand, that all them which do take up their Cross, and follow after him, are worthy of him. And we can boldly testify, that in our taking up this Cross, and working publickly on the first Day of the Week, to please God, he doth own us to be worthy of his Son Jesus Christ: For he hath witnessed it by his Holy Spirit in our Hearts: By which we also know, that the Scripture is true; and that the Practice of keeping this pretended Sabbath, in this Colony, is Superstition, Idolatry, and Abomination in the Sight of God. Also, every Text of Scripture, that the Ministers have ever brought, to convince us that the first Day of the Week is a Sabbath, has another Meaning, and not as they pretend: For by perusing those Scriptures, it appears plainly, that Christ, and the holy Men that spake them Scriptures, did not mean to teach People to keep the first Day of the Week; neither was it in their Mind to teach any such Thing; So that there is not one Word in
<PB N="4" REF="008575_0004_102F871280F97748"/>
all the Bible, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, for this pretended Sabbath; and the Scripture says, <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Transgression,</HI> Rom. iv, 15, and <HI>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law,</HI> Rom. v. 13; and the Con∣fession of Faith of this Colony, says, in page 7, <HI>Believe in all Divine Worship: It is not enough, that this or that Act of Worship is not forbidden in the Word of God; if it be not commanded, and you per∣form it, you may fear you will be found guilty.</HI> Thus by their own Confession of Faith, they may fear they will be found guilty for keeping their pretended Sabbath themselves; then how much more guilty will they be found, for persecuting others, to force them to keep it, by spoiling their Goods, and im∣prisoning and torturing their Bodies! even them that God hath enlightened to see that this Sabbath is of Men, and that they ought not to conform to it; because God requires them to worship him in Spirit and in Truth: The Scripture says, <HI>It is vain to worship God by the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P>WE desire People to search the Scriptures, and see whether these Things are so, or no: And for Encouragement, the first Person that shews us the Chapter and Verse in the Bible, that says one Word about keeping the first Day of the Week for a Sabbath, shall have Ten Pounds Lawful Money Reward for his Trouble, paid by us, or either of us,</P>
