<HEAD>The Body of DEATH <HI>Anatomized,</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. VII. 24.</HI></BIBL>
<P>O wretched Man that I am: who shall deliver me from the body of this Death?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are the doleful out∣cry of one of the most holy Men that ever lived: It is no less a Person than the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> that Great and Excellent Servant of Christ, who is here bitterly bemoaning him∣self. In this his Self-lamentation Observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Matter</HI> of his Lamentation, or that which he complains of, Namely, <HI>The Body of Death in him:</HI> that's the <HI>Gravamen,</HI> the burden of his holy Soul. By the <HI>Body of Death</HI> is meant <HI>Inhe∣rent Corruption,</HI> which he sometimes calls <HI>Sin, In∣dwelling Sin,</HI> a <HI>Law of Sin.</HI> — 'Tis called a <HI>Body,</HI> partly, because it overspreads the <HI>whole Body</HI> of Man. <HI>Original Sin</HI> eats into the <HI>Body,</HI> &amp; diffuses
<PB N="2" REF="001336_0003_0FB2885AB51A48B8"/>
it self thro' every Member thereof, and em∣ploys them as instruments to act by. Partly, because it consists of many <HI>Members</HI> or Parts. A <HI>Body</HI> is made up of many <HI>Members</HI> united one to another. Thus <HI>Original Sin</HI> has a great many <HI>Members</HI> and Branches: 'tis a <HI>Mass</HI> of Corrupti∣on, a Collection of Lusts. The <HI>Members</HI> of this <HI>Body of Sin</HI> are far more numerous than the Members of our <HI>Humane Bodies:</HI> for there are <HI>many Lusts</HI> that have Possession of, and act by, each single <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Body.</HI> There is but <HI>One Tongue</HI> in the Body, yet the Sins of the <HI>Tongue</HI> are numberless.</P>
<P>Tis called a <HI>Body of Death,</HI> Partly, because it makes men <HI>Dead</HI> unto and in Spiritual Duties. As for Natural men it makes them altogether <HI>Dead</HI> unto Spiritural Duties; either they per∣form them not at all, or they discharge them in a manner wholly <HI>Dead</HI> and Lifeless. As for the Regenerate, Indwelling Sin causes in them a great deal of Averseness to and <HI>Deadness</HI> in Religious Duties; they do not discharge Du∣ties with that Life, Vigour and Activity which they ought to do; and this is from the dead∣ning Influence of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Again, It is called a <HI>Body of Death,</HI> because it tends to and issues in <HI>Death.</HI> Original Sin is a <HI>Deadly</HI> Principle. As for the Godly, it brings <HI>Temporal Death</HI> upon them: Because they have <HI>Sin</HI> in them, they have the Seed of <HI>Death</HI> in them. As for the Unregenerate, this Indwelling
<PB N="3" REF="001336_0004_0FB2885C9626AF50"/>
Sin does bring upon them <HI>Eternal Death:</HI> It ceases not till it has accomplished their Ever∣lasting Destruction. 'Tis this <HI>Body of Death</HI> whereof the Apostle complains, which is the first thing Observable.</P>
<P N="2">2. His complaint concerning it, <HI>O Wretched Man that I am:</HI> He cryes out and complains of himself as <HI>Wretched</HI> on the account of this Body of Death. <HI>Wretched,</HI> does not signify Cursed or Unhappy, but Weary and Tired: like a man that had fought till spent, and ready to sink, unless some One come in to his help and sup∣port.</P>
<P N="3">3. His earnest Desire of Deliverance from it, <HI>Who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> This is not the Voice of one <HI>Doubting</HI> of Deli∣verance, or at a loss where to go for Delive∣rance; for he was sure of Deliverance in due time, and knew from whom his Deliverance would come; as the next Verse shows, <HI>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> It is therefore the Voice of one that longs for, that breathes and pants after Deliverance.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI></HI> is one matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation, and what he much longs to be Delivered from.</HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine may be spoken to under three Propositions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001336_0005_0FB2885E0D9A77B8"/>PROP. I. <HI>Every Godly Man has Sin dwelling in him.</HI> All men have a corrupt Nature handed down to them from our first Parents. They are <HI>Conceived in Sin and brought forth in Iniquity,</HI> Psal. 51.5. This <HI>Sin of mans Nature</HI> is not perfectly removed in the Work of Regeneration and Sanctification: The best of Men have the <HI>Re∣mainders of Corruption</HI> in them as long as they continue in this World. The Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> was, it may be, inferior to no meer man as to holi∣ness of Heart and Life, and yet he does in our Text and Context confess that he had Sin dwel∣ling and stirring in him. It is <HI>Self-Delusion</HI> to think or say, <HI>That we have no Sin,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.8. There is no <HI>Sinless Person</HI> on this side Heaven: and therefore the <HI>Mortification of Sin,</HI> is a work wherein Saints are to be engaged, all the dayes of their Lives.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>This Indwelling Sin is One matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation.</HI> The renewed Soul of the Apostle does in the Text Sigh &amp; Groan over the remainders of Sin in him▪ Herein he is a Pattern of all true Believers; every holy man is like him in this point.</P>
<P>Two things may here be Enquired into.</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>How do the Godly Lament Indwelling Sin?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Principally.</HI> The Body of Death is the <HI>Chief Matter</HI> of their Lamentation. There is nothing which a Godly Man does more bitterly bewail than this <HI>Plague of his own Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="001336_0006_0FB28860F515D030"/>1. He Laments this more than any <HI>Outward Affliction. Corruption within</HI> causes more heavi∣ness and sorrow in his Spirit, than all <HI>Troubles Without.</HI> This we may see Verifyed in the A∣postle <HI>Paul:</HI> He was a man exercised with as various &amp; great <HI>Calamities</HI> as most men. Scarce any, if any, did suffer more than he did in his time: he himself gives us a Summary account of his many &amp; grievous sufferings, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Now tho' he was a Man of such <HI>Sufferings,</HI> yet we do not find that he com∣plained under them: he never cryed out of his sharp Afflictions bemoaning himself on the ac∣count of them. No, instead of lamenting them he <HI>Rejoyced</HI> and <HI>Gloried</HI> in them; they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> matter of his <HI>Triumph,</HI> not of his <HI>Sorrow.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now, when he gives us an account of the <HI>Body of Death and Sin</HI> in him, he cryes out, <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> The <HI>Body of Death</HI> is a Saint's <HI>greatest Burden:</HI> He groans more under the weight of that, than of any burden of Affliction. Hence it is that he is willing that God should lay any <HI>Afflictions</HI> upon him which may mortify his <HI>Corruptions:</HI> He is content God should use the sharpest <HI>Remedies</HI> that may kill his Lusts. Let God take away the Health and Strength of his <HI>Body,</HI> let God do any thing with him, <HI>If it may slay Sin, he is satisfyed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He Laments this more than any <HI>Actual Sin. Acts of Sin</HI> are to be bewailed, but the <HI>Principle of Sin</HI> much more; And a Godly Man is in bit∣terness
<PB N="6" REF="001336_0007_0FB2886856A35960"/>
of Spirit for his <HI>Actual Iniquities,</HI> but more for <HI>Original Sin.</HI> He grieves that he has com∣mitted any Sin, but he grieves more that there is such a corrupt heart in him which carryes him to such Sins. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is much worse than any <HI>Actual Sin.</HI> The Lusts of the heart are great∣er Evils than the <HI>Sins of the Life,</HI> as shall presently be proved. There is therefore more cause to bewail Sin in us, than Sin acted by us. Accor∣dingly a Godly Man, is by his <HI>Actual Sins</HI> led up to the Consideration of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and he Principally Mourns over that. When <HI>David</HI> had been guilty of Murder and Adultery, he bit∣terly bewailed those horrid Sins; but his Peni∣tent Eye did especially look to, and weep over that <HI>Vile Heart</HI> from whence they proceeded, Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me. Behold!</HI> Says he. He points his finger to, and takes special notice of, his Natural Corruption: and tis as if he should have said, <Q>Ah Lord! What a Cursed and Sinful Nature have I that is prone to such Monstrous Abominations?</Q> The vileness of his <HI>Heart</HI> was that which mostly abased him. Thus the Apostle in the context makes a Peni∣tent mention of the many <HI>Actings</HI> of Sin where∣of he was guilty, but at length his most bitter complaints are made against the body of Death, <HI>O wretched man that I am: who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> The strength of his Sorrow is spent on this: He stops not till he
<PB N="7" REF="001336_0008_0FB2886AC34B9120"/>
comes to the <HI>Fountain head,</HI> and there he lyes down and weeps.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Godly do Lament Indwelling Sin <HI>Continually.</HI> This Body of Death lyes down with them, rises up with them, and accompa∣nies them all the day long, and so is an occa∣sion of their constant Lamentation. 'Tis as a <HI>Loathsome Corps</HI> chained to them, which is the perpetual burden and abhorrence of their Souls. Every day they find it inclining and prompting them to Sin, deadning and indisposing them to duty, and so is a daily grief of Heart to them: by reason of this, <HI>they go Mourning to their Graves.</HI></P>
<P>So much for the first Enquiry.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Why do the Godly make Indwelling Sin the Matter of their Lamentation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They have abundant <HI>Reason</HI> so to do.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> directly opposes the <HI>whole Law of God.</HI> It is contrary not only to <HI>Some</HI> of Gods Commands, but to <HI>Every One</HI> of them. It is an Universal contrariety to the holy Law of God: It consists in an Aversation to <HI>Every thing</HI> that God requires, and an Inclination to <HI>Every thing</HI> that God forbids. There is an ab∣sence of <HI>All Good,</HI> and a fulness of <HI>All Evil</HI> in <HI>Original Sin.</HI> There are as <HI>many Lusts</HI> in In∣dwelling Sin, as there are <HI>Laws</HI> in the Word of God: To every <HI>Law</HI> there is an opposite <HI>Lust.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001336_0009_0FB2886C41912B38"/>
Does God require <HI>Faith?</HI> Opposite to this is the Lust of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> Does He require <HI>Humi∣lity?</HI> Opposite to this is the <HI>Lust</HI> of <HI>Pride.</HI> Does he require <HI>Hope</HI> in His Mercy, mutual <HI>Forgiveness, Patience</HI> under Trials, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Oppo∣site to these are the Lusts of <HI>Despair, Revenge, Impatience,</HI> &amp;c. So that <HI>Original Sin</HI> is as exten∣sive as the holy Law of God: It is then di∣rectly contrary to the whole Law of God in every part of it. In this respect it is far worse than any <HI>Actual Sin:</HI> for Actual Sins are di∣rectly contrary to some particular Commands only. But Indwelling Sin is an <HI>Entire Body of Lusts,</HI> which is contrary to the <HI>Entire Body of Divine Laws.</HI> There is no Law, which Origi∣nal Sin, does not in one branch or other, stand in a direct Opposition unto. It is there∣fore called a <HI>Law of Sin,</HI> partly, because it lyes in a parallel Opposition to the <HI>Divine Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is then a just Matter of Lamen∣tation. O how worthy is that <HI>Sin</HI> to be be∣wailed which is so <HI>Exceeding broad?</HI> If we are deeply to be humbled for every <HI>Act</HI> of Sin which transgresses the Law of God in some single point, how much more for that <HI>Sin</HI> which transgresses the Law of God in all points? <HI>The more Laws</HI> are broken by a Sin, the <HI>more</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be <HI>Lamented.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001336_0010_0FB2886E20857468"/>2. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is a principle of Cursed <HI>En∣mity against God.</HI> The Mind as far as it is <HI>Carnal</HI> or Corrupt, is not only an <HI>Enemy</HI> to God, but also <HI>Enmity against God,</HI> Rom. 8.7. Nothing worse than this can be said of it. Hereby is pointed out to us that extream Antipathy a∣gainst God which there is in Original Sin. An <HI>Enemy</HI> may be reconciled to God, but <HI>Enmity</HI> can never be reconciled to Him: It is totally and implacably opposite to the blessed God. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> sets it self against <HI>GOD</HI> to Asto∣nishment: The dreadful Malignity of it against <HI>GOD</HI> we may see in that power which it has over many Ungodly men; it makes them to be <HI>Haters of God, Fighters against God, De∣nyers of God:</HI> This Sin within, would, if it could, pull <HI>GOD</HI> from His Throne; yea, deprive <HI>GOD</HI> of His very Being: The Saints and Ser∣vants of God have that within them which would do all this. And they do oftentimes ex∣perience in some degree, the workings of this horrid Enmity against God in themselves: There are most <HI>Wicked, Blasphemous, Atheisti∣cal thoughts</HI> which do sometimes arise in their Hearts. They find Indwelling Sin many times prompting them to offer unto God the most vile Affronts imaginable. Do they not some∣times question whether there be a <HI>GOD?</HI> whether the <HI>Scriptures</HI> be true? whether there be a divine <HI>Providence,</HI> and whether there be <HI>Future Rewards</HI> or Punishments? Thus does
<PB N="10" REF="001336_0011_0FB28879D9162A38"/>
<HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> act in opposition to the Being, Word and Providence of God: And is not such a vile Principle to be abhorred?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is the <HI>Root</HI> of all <HI>Actual Sins.</HI> All the Sins of our <HI>Lives</HI> proceed from the Sin of our <HI>Nature.</HI> The <HI>Corruption of the Heart,</HI> is the rise and spring of all Sinful Thoughts, Words and Deeds, Mat. 15.18, 19. <HI>Out of the Heart,</HI> as corrupt, <HI>proceed Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries,</HI> &amp;c. 'Tis <HI>Lust</HI> within that <HI>conceives and brings forth Sin,</HI> Jam. 1.14, 15. For this cause all Sinful Deeds are called the <HI>Deeds of the Flesh,</HI> Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. Neither God, nor the Devil, nor the World, are the Authors of our Sins; but our own <HI>Corrupt Hearts:</HI> these are the next and immediate causes of every iniquity committed by us. This <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is then the radical Sin, the <HI>Root of Bitterness</HI> upon which all Sin grows; Tis the <HI>Sin of Sins,</HI> the Mother and Nurse of all Sins, seminally containing in it every sort and kind of Sins; it is therefore more evil than all <HI>Actual Sins;</HI> for there is more of Evil in the <HI>Cause,</HI> than in the <HI>Effect;</HI> more Poison in the <HI>Fountain,</HI> than in all its <HI>Streams;</HI> It is but <HI>Some degree</HI> of the Venome and Malignity of <HI>Original Sin</HI> that is diffused into all <HI>Actual Sins.</HI> Surely, such a principle as this, which is productive of all manner of Evils, is to be greatly lamented.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="001336_0012_0FB2887B41B1CAC8"/>4. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is <HI>more set upon Sin because God forbids it.</HI> Such is the mad fury and rage of Lust, as it makes the Command and Pro∣hibition of God, the very <HI>Reason</HI> why it urges to Evil, and disswades from Good. The more God forbids a thing the more eager it is after it, and therefore will do it <HI>because God forbids it.</HI> The more God requires a thing the more back∣ward tis to it, and <HI>Therefore</HI> will not do it <HI>Because</HI> God requires it: It <HI>takes occasion from the Com∣mandment to work all manner of Iniquity,</HI> and there∣by discovers it self to be <HI>Out of measure Sinful,</HI> Rom. 7.11, 13. Were not a thing <HI>Forbidden</HI> it could be content to let it alone, and were not a thing <HI>Commanded</HI> it could be content to do it. <HI>Lust</HI> is <HI>Irritated</HI> and exasperated by the Law of God: It delights to cross God in His Will; Its Working thus in a spiteful opposition to the Command of God, is daily to be seen in the <HI>Lives</HI> of men. When God would have had the <HI>Israelites</HI> go into <HI>Canaan,</HI> then they were for returning into <HI>Egypt;</HI> and when God would <HI>not</HI> have them go into <HI>Canaan,</HI> then they were set upon going in, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.4, 40. <HI>&amp;c. In∣dwelling Sin</HI> is a principle of contradiction to the Law of God; it is set upon <HI>Sin for Sin's sake:</HI> And is not such a <HI>Malicious Principle</HI> as this a just matter of Lamentation? Should it not make our Souls bleed to find that there is such an heart in us; so full of malignity against the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Supreme Lord?</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001336_0013_0FB2887CB854B338"/>5. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> does <HI>alwayes Sollicite to Sin,</HI> It is a principle that is <HI>ever</HI> stirring and work∣ing toward Sin: it is <HI>Never Idle,</HI> but <HI>Always Active,</HI> and its <HI>Perpetual Tendency</HI> is to Sin. Some∣times it prompts to <HI>Sins of Omission,</HI> endeavour∣ing to draw us off from that duty which God requires of us; and if it cannot prevail to a neglect of duty, it labours to make us <HI>Careless,</HI> Slighty and Formal in the discharge of it: and if it cannot work us up to this frame, it en∣deavours to <HI>Obstruct</HI> and <HI>Distract</HI> us in the duty as much as it can, Rom. 7.21. <HI>I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</HI> He experimentally found the stirrings of Cor∣ruption in the very time of his discharging Duties, that he could not do them as well as he would. At other times it prompts us to <HI>Sins of Commission,</HI> endeavouring to draw us to the doing of that which is evil. And if it can∣not prevail upon us <HI>Outwardly</HI> to act it, then it seeks to bring us to <HI>Inward Pleasing Thoughts</HI> of it. Thus it is evermore following us with Secret <HI>Solicitations to Sin,</HI> Jam. 1.14. <HI>Sin within,</HI> is a more restless and constant tempter, than <HI>Satan without:</HI> And should it not afflict us to find and feel such an <HI>Unwearied Solicitour</HI> to Sin in our very bosomes? How can we chuse but cry out and complain of it?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="13" REF="001336_0014_0FB2887E45010180"/>6. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is an <HI>Enemy to Grace. Cor∣ruption</HI> is a principle directly contrary to <HI>Grace.</HI> It is every way opposite unto it, in its original, operations and tendency. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> wages a <HI>Continual War</HI> with <HI>Inherent Grace,</HI> Rom. 7.23. Gal. 5.17. It strives to hinder the actings of <HI>Grace;</HI> it endeavours to weaken and ruine the principle of <HI>Grace.</HI> If the good Spirit of God excites any <HI>Good Motions</HI> in the Soul, Indwelling Sin labours to kill them in their <HI>Birth,</HI> as <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> the Male Seed of <HI>Israel. Sin</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> like <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> struggle and contend in the same Womb. And should we not loathe that <HI>Enemy of all Righteousness</HI> that is in us? That principle which seeks to destroy the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> that we partake of?</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is that which does the Saints <HI>most Hurt.</HI> It is an enemy to their Good, it <HI>Wars against their Souls,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.11. Nor is there any thing which does so much hurt unto them as that <HI>Sin</HI> which is in them. The <HI>Devil</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> never do them any harm but by the improvement of this vile <HI>Principle</HI> in them: all our mischiefs are from our <HI>Lusts;</HI> therefore they are called <HI>Hurtful Lusts,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.9. Tis <HI>Sin within</HI> that Wounds our Consciences, breaks our Peace, darkens our Evidences, robs us of our Comfort, defiles and brings guilt upon our Souls. Indwelling Sin is our <HI>Greatest Troubler,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001336_0015_0FB288840887EDF0"/>
the <HI>Scorce</HI> of all our Calamities. Were it not for our Lusts, we might be easy in all Con∣ditions. Well may a Believer cry out and com∣plain of such an hurtful principle.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>As a Godly Man greatly bewailes, so he much longs to be delivered from Indwelling Sin.</HI> He is so wearied with it, as that his very Soul desires to be <HI>delivered</HI> from it. Now there are three things respecting <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> which he longs to be delivered from.</P>
<P N="1">1. He desires to be <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Pre∣vailing Power</HI> of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI> It is most cer∣tain that a true Believer is <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of Indwelling Sin: It does not <HI>Lord</HI> it over him, so that he should willingly, readily and chearfully obey it, as he did in his State of Unregeneracy. A Convert ceases to be a <HI>Servant of Sin,</HI> and is freed from its absolute rule, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.17, 18. And Sin Within shall never more have a plenary <HI>Dominion</HI> over them, <HI>Verse</HI> 14. Nevertheless Sin within is capable of <HI>Prevailing</HI> over Believers, and oftentimes does actually <HI>Prevail:</HI> It carryes them away to great and Scandalous Sins, as the Scriptures do testify in many instances. Now the truely Godly do earnestly desire that they may be Saved from Sins prevalency. And hence they are much in <HI>Prayer</HI> to God for preservation from the <HI>Power</HI> of Lust, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.13. <HI>and</HI> 119.133. And hence
<PB N="15" REF="001336_0016_0FB288867AF69EA8"/>
it is that they exercise themselves in endeavours to <HI>Keep under the Body of Sin,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. A Godly Man is one that has heartily renounced Subjection to the <HI>Law of Sin,</HI> and desires that it may never more over-power him.</P>
<P N="2">2. He desires to be <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Terrify∣ing Power</HI> of <HI>Indwelling</HI> Sin. This Sin is many times a principle of <HI>Terrour</HI> to the truly Godly: It so darkens their Minds, so deadens their Hearts and Affections, so stirs and works in them, as that it fills them with perplexing doubts and fears.

They are ready to account themselves <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and to Despair of Salvation thro' the horrid workings of Inherent Corruption.

They cry to God for those fresh gales of the Spirit, which may scatter those <HI>Fogs</HI> and <HI>Mists,</HI> which <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> has covered their Souls withal.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="001336_0018_0FB2888B940FD958"/>
Doctrine before us gives a clear demonstration of the Almighty <HI>Grace</HI> of God exerted in the Work of Regeneration. When a Man is truly Converted, he bitterly bewailes <HI>Indwelling Sin,</HI> he cryes out of it as an intolerable burden, and <HI>Groans in Spirit</HI> for a full deliverance from it. How wonderful is the <HI>Change</HI> wrought in such an Heart! Man naturally <HI>Loves</HI> his <HI>Lusts</HI> with a <HI>Boundless Love;</HI> they are the very delight of his Soul, the <HI>Elements</HI> in which he loves to move; they are dearer to him than <HI>GOD</HI> Himself: he <HI>Idolizes</HI> them and puts them in the Place of <HI>GOD,</HI> Phil. 3.19. Yea, he exalts them <HI>Above GOD</HI> in his affections, 2 Tim. 3.4. <HI>Lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of God:</HI> The very Life and all of a Sinner is bound up in his <HI>Lusts;</HI> he is never more at ease, nor in the enjoyment of greater Satisfaction, than when he is fulfilling the de∣sires of the flesh. But now, when he is Con∣verted, his Love to Lust, like <HI>Amnons</HI> to <HI>Tamar,</HI> is turned into the greatest Hatred: He sayes to his beloved Lusts, <HI>Arise, be gone;</HI> and he calls upon God to put them out from him and to bolt the door of his Heart after them. O <HI>Strange Alteration!</HI> How comes it about that all on a sudden the <HI>Inclination,</HI> bent, frame and whole posture of the Soul is thus turned another way? Surely, 'tis <HI>God</HI> that does this; an <HI>Almighty Hand</HI> must needs effect it. None has such power over the Heart, but that God in whose hands the Hearts of all Men are, and who turns
<PB N="18" REF="001336_0019_0FB2888CABCAC8F0"/>

<P>We hence learn that those are <HI>Not Godly Per∣sons</HI> who do not make <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> the matter of their <HI>Lamentation.</HI> There is the highest rea∣son to bewail it, and all that are truly <HI>Godly</HI> do greatly bewail it; Such therefore as bewail it not, are not <HI>Godly.</HI> The not Mourning over <HI>In∣dwelling Sin,</HI> is a sure sign of an <HI>Unregenerate man;</HI> he is a perfect Stranger to <HI>Grace,</HI> who is a Stranger to <HI>Grief</HI> and Sorrow for inherent Cor∣ruption. And if so, then several Persons may from hence be convinced of their being in a State of Unregeneracy.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Those who <HI>Bless themselves</HI> in the <HI>Goodness of their Natures.</HI> Tho' the Word of God declares that the Heart of Fallen man, is <HI>Deceitful above all things and Desperately wicked,</HI> Jer. 17.9. Yet there are some who will not believe or own any such thing concerning themselves: for ought they can discern their <HI>Hearts</HI> are as <HI>Good</HI> as they need be; they find them to be well-in∣clined, well-disposed, well-meaning; they do not perceive that there are swarms of Lusts and <HI>Vile Affections</HI> in them: they wonder to hear Persons crying out of the vileness of their hearts;
<PB N="19" REF="001336_0020_0FB28890B6D34358"/>
they see no cause of such complaints concern∣ing themselves. As for such Persons as these, there is no Spiritual <HI>Light</HI> in them, their eyes are closed to this day, and through the <HI>Darkness that is upon their Minds,</HI> they see not those monstrous Corruptions that are in them, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18. 'Tis possible such Persons may lead <HI>Lives</HI> that are Civil, Orderly and Blameless as to men, [<HI>Phil.</HI> 3.6.] yet all this while they are far from being in <HI>Sanctified Estate.</HI> No man was ever Converted, who was not Convinced of the Sin∣fulness and Wretchedness of his <HI>Nature.</HI> He never was <HI>Holy,</HI> that has not seen himself to be <HI>Exceeding Vile.</HI> He never was in a <HI>State of Sal∣vation,</HI> that has not been sensible of his being in a <HI>Lost and Sinful State</HI> by Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Those who make the <HI>Sin of their Nature</HI> an <HI>Excuse</HI> for their <HI>Actual Sins.</HI> Tho' there be no∣thing that can <HI>Excuse Sin,</HI> yet Sinners seek to <HI>Find Excuses:</HI> And one thing which they are ready to use as an <HI>Excuse,</HI> is the <HI>Inclination of Na∣ture to Sin: Tis Natural,</HI> say they, <HI>to Sin.</HI> All mens hearts are <HI>Inclined</HI> to Evil. <HI>Nature</HI> will have its course. Such as these never did un∣feignedly <HI>Mourn</HI> for the <HI>Corruption of their Nature▪</HI> if they had, they would see this to be an <HI>Aggra∣vation</HI> of their Sin, and in no sort an <HI>Extenuation</HI> of it. They would see <HI>Adultery, Theft, Revenge, &amp;c.</HI> to be so much the worse, because they pro∣ceed from an <HI>Adulterers, Thievish, Revengful heart.</HI> Were <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> the matter of their <HI>Lamenta∣tion,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001336_0021_0FB28895917CF1A8"/>
they would not plead it for the <HI>Justi∣fying</HI> themselves in acts of Iniquity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Those who <HI>Cherish</HI> and <HI>Indulge</HI> any <HI>Lust.</HI> If there be any <HI>Particular Corruption</HI> whereof Per∣sons are tender, and wherein they do inwardly and customarily delight, such Persons are not afflicted in Soul for the Pollution of their <HI>Hearts.</HI> Tho' Persons <HI>Restrain</HI> their Lusts and suffer them not to break out, yet if they allow them to act and work in their Souls, they are <HI>Lovers</HI> of their Lusts, and not <HI>Mourners</HI> for them. Thus if Per∣sons allow themselves in a course of <HI>Unclean, Co∣vetous, Revengful Thoughts,</HI> they do not bewail <HI>Indwelling Sin:</HI> Were it <HI>Really Lamented,</HI> men would engage in the <HI>Universal Mortification</HI> of it. They would not <HI>Cherish</HI> any <HI>Member</HI> of that vile <HI>Body of Sin,</HI> but would labour to keep under and subdue the <HI>whole Body.</HI></P>

<P>Labour for a clear and full <HI>Conviction</HI> of the <HI>Exceeding Sinfulness</HI> of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI> It is indeed <HI>Exceeding Sinful,</HI> Rom. 7.13. <HI>Sinful</HI> above <HI>Hyper∣bole,</HI> as the Original suggests: And if you are once thorowly <HI>Convinced</HI> hereof, you will soon bemoan your selves on the account of it; and until your have such a <HI>Sight</HI> of it, you will ne∣ver duely Lament it. Now in order hereto two things must be done.</P>
<P N="1">1. Compare your <HI>Natures</HI> with the <HI>Holy Law of God.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> is a <HI>Glass</HI> wherein you may see the true Face of <HI>Sin</HI> upon your Souls. We are to remember that our <HI>Natures</HI> ought to be conformed to the <HI>Law</HI> of God in every point: We should be as Holy and Sinless as that <HI>Law</HI> requires. Our <HI>Hearts</HI> ought exactly to answer that <HI>Strict Rule:</HI> Now compare your selves therewith, and you will see your <HI>Sinfulness.</HI> — You ought according to the <HI>Law</HI> of God to be <HI>Alwayes</HI> inclined to <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Never</HI> inclined to <HI>Evil:</HI> to <HI>Hate Sin</HI> without the <HI>Least Love</HI> to it: to <HI>Believe</HI> in God without the least <HI>Distrust:</HI> to

be <HI>Humble</HI> without the least <HI>Pride:</HI> to be <HI>Meek</HI> without the least <HI>Passion:</HI> to be <HI>Sober</HI> and Tem∣perate without the least <HI>Excess:</HI> to be <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Chaste</HI> without the least <HI>Unclean Motion:</HI> to <HI>Love your Neighbour</HI> without bearing him the <HI>Least ill Will:</HI> to discharge all Duties without the <HI>Least Defect.</HI> Such a One you ought to be according to the <HI>Holy Commandment</HI> of God: but Consider whether you are so. Oh! how far do you come short of being such a One? Will you not, if you take this course, soon cry out, <HI>Unclean! Unclean! Behold, I am Vile!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Beg of God</HI> to give you a <HI>Spiritual Discovery</HI> of the <HI>Sinfulness</HI> of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI> By compa∣ring your selves with the <HI>Law</HI> of God, you may attain to such rational Convictions of your Sin∣fulness, as may force from you a <HI>Confession</HI> of your Vileness; but you will never so see your defilement as to loathe your selves for it, unless <HI>God Open you Eyes:</HI> 'Tis He must let light into our Souls to see aright, the hideous monstrous∣ness of those Lusts, that lodge in the Secrets of our Hearts. Beg therefore of <HI>God</HI> to show you that which you see not. Go to Jesus Christ for <HI>Eyes Salve</HI> to anoint you, that you may see your selves <HI>Wretched,</HI> and <HI>Miserable,</HI> and <HI>Poor,</HI> and <HI>Blind,</HI> and <HI>Naked,</HI> Rev. 3.17, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</P>

<P N="1">1. Your <HI>Burdened Souls</HI> shall never more be brought under <HI>Subjection</HI> to <HI>Indwelling</HI> Sin.

will recover its mastery over you; but be not afraid: Keep up a <HI>Fear of Watchfulness,</HI> but don't give way to a <HI>Fear of Dispondency:</HI> The Almighty and most Faithful God has given His Word for it, That <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you,</HI> Rom. 6.14. Tho' it may pursue you, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did <HI>Israel,</HI> yet it shall never carry you back into Bon∣dage. The Lord that has <HI>Begun to Deliver,</HI> will <HI>Go on to Deliver;</HI> He will most assuredly keep you <HI>By His Mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Your <HI>Wearied Souls</HI> shall shortly be <HI>At Rest</HI> from <HI>Indwelling</HI> Sin. It will not be long before your desires of <HI>Deliverance</HI> shall be fully Satisfyed. That which you <HI>Long</HI> for shall be granted unto you, and that very <HI>Quickly. Heaven,</HI> tho' it be <HI>Afar off</HI> as to local distance, yet 'tis <HI>Near</HI> in point of Time.

Your <HI>Warfare</HI> shall speedily be <HI>Accomplished,</HI> and then shall you ex∣perimentally Know that which your fain <HI>would</HI> Know, but never yet <HI>Did</HI> Know, Namely, <HI>What it is to Serve GOD without Sin,</HI> and that to all ETERNITY.</P>
