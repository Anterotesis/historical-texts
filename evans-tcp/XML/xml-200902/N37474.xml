<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a very great Writer of very Little Books.</BYLINE>
<P>MUCH might be said in favour of this collection, but as we have no room for critical disquisitions, we shall only observe to our readers, that the custom of singing these songs and lullabies to children is of great antiquity. It is even as old as the time of the ancient <HI>Druids. Garacta∣cus,</HI> King of the <HI>Britons,</HI> was rocked in his Cradle in the Isle of <HI>Mora,</HI> now called <HI>Anglesea,</HI> and tuned to sleep by some of these soporiferous sonnets. As the best things, however, may be made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use of, so the kind of composi∣tions has been employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> When that
<PB N="vi" REF="049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48"/>great prince turned his arms against <HI>France,</HI> he composed the following march to lead his Troops to Battle, well knowing that Music had often <GAP DESC="music" DISP="〈♫〉"/>
<PB N="vii" REF="049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48"/>the power of inspiring courage, espe∣cially in the minds of good men. Of this his enemies took advantage, and, as our happy nation, even at that time, was never without a faction, some of the male contents adopted the follow∣ing Words to the King's own March, in order to ridicule his Majesty, and to shew the Folly and Impossibility of his Undertaking.</P>
<Q><L>There was an old woman toss'd in a blanket,</L>
<L>Seventeen times as high as the moon;</L>
<L>But where she was going no mortal could tell,</L>
<L>For under her arm she carried a broom.</L>
<L>Old woman, old woman, old woman, said' I!</L>
<L>Whither, ah whither, ah whither, so high?</L>
<L><HI>To sweep the cobavebs from the sky,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I'll be with you by and by</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="049118_0004_10265B996C729210"/>
Here the king is represented as an old woman, engaged in a pursuit the most absurd and extravagant imagin∣able; but when he had routed the whole <HI>French</HI> army at the battle of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> taking their king and the flower of their nobility prisoners, and with ten thousand men only made himself master of their kingdom; the very men, who had ridiculed him be∣fore, began to think nothing was too arduous for him to surmount, they therefore can celled the former sonnet, which they were now ashamed of, and substituted this in its stead, which, you will please to observe, goes to the same tune.</P>
<Q><L>So vast is the prowess of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>He'll pluck a hair from the pale-face moon:</L>
<L>Or a lion familiarly take by the tooth,</L>
<L>And lead him about as you lead a baboon.</L>
<L><PB N="ix" REF="049118_0004_10265B996C729210"/>
All princes and potentates under the sun,</L>
<L>Through fear, into corners and holes away run;</L>
<L>While nor dangers nor dread his swift progress retards,</L>
<L>For he deals about kingdoms as we do our cards.</L></Q>
<P>When this was shewn to his majes∣ty, he smilingly said, that folly always dealt in extravagancies, and that knaves sometimes put on the garb of fools, to promote, in that disguise, their own wicked designs. <Q>The flattery in the last, says he, is more insult∣ing than the impudence of the first, and to weak minds might do more mischief; but we have the old pro∣verb in our favour: <HI>If we do not flatter ourselves, the flattery of others will never hurt us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We cannot conclude without ob∣serving,
<PB N="x" REF="049118_0005_10265B9AF9CBE218"/>the great probability there is, that the custom of making <HI>Nonsense Verses</HI> in our schools was borrowed from this practice among the old <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> nurses; they have, indeed, been always the first preceptors of the youth of this kingdom, and from them the rudiments of taste and learning are naturally derived. Let none there∣fore speak irreverently of this ancient maternity, as they may be considered, as the great grandmothers of science and knowledge.</P>

<LG>
<L>THERE was a little Man,</L>
<L>Who wooed a little Maid;</L>
<L>And he said, little Maid, will you wed, wed, wed?</L>
<L>I have little more to say,</L>
<L>So will you aye or nay,</L>
<L>For the least said is soonest mended, ded, ded.</L>

<L>Then replied the little Maid,</L>
<L>Little Sir, you've little said</L>
<L>To induce a little Maid for to wed, wed, wed;</L>
<L>You must say a little more,</L>
<L>And produce a little Ore,</L>
<L>Ere I make a little Print in your Bed, Bed, Bed.</L>

<L>Then the little Man replied,</L>
<L>If you'll be my little Bride,</L>
<L>I'll raise my Love Notes a little higher, higher, higher;</L>
<L>Though my Offers are not meet,</L>
<L>Yet my little Heart is great,</L>
<L>With the little God of Love all on Fire, Fire, Fire.</L>

Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat,</L>

<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Then the little Man he sigh'd,</L>
<L>And, some say, a little cry'd,</L>
<L>For his little Heart was big with Sorrow, Sorrow, Sorrow;</L>
<L>As I am your little Slave,</L>
<L>If the little that I have</L>
<L>Be too little, little, we will borrow, borrow, borrow. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He who borrows is another Man's Slave, and pawns his Honour, his Lib∣erty, and sometimes his Nose for the Payment. Learn to live on a little and be independent.</P>

<L>O Mistress mine, where are you running?</L>
<L>O stay and hear, your true Love's coming,</L>
<L>That can sing both high and low.</L>
<L>Trip no further, pretty Sweeting,</L>
<L>Journeys end in Lover's meeting,</L>

<L>What is Love? 'tis not hereafter:</L>
<L>Present Mirth hath present Laughter.</L>

<L>THE poor Soul sat singing by a Sycamore-tree,</L>
<L>Her Hand on her Bosom, her Head on her Knee,</L>
<L>The fresh Streams ran by her, and murmur'd her Moans,</L>
<L>Her salt Tears fell from her, and soften'd the Stones:</L>
<L>Sing all a green Willow must be my Garland,</L>
<L>Let nobody blame him, his Scorn I upprove.</L>
<L>I call'd my Love false Love, but what said he then?</L>
