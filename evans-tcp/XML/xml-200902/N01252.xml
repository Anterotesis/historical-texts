<HEAD><HI>An Essay to do GOOD.</HI> By a disswasive from Tavern-haunting, and Excessive Drinking.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By <HI>Benjamin Wadsworth,</HI> Pastor of a Church of Christ in <HI>Boston;</HI> together with a <HI>Lecture SERMON,</HI> by the same Author.</HEAD>
<P>TIS said of our glorious Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, that he went about <HI>doing good.</HI> Act 10.38. All his Disci∣ples, <HI>should walk as he also walked,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.6. They should imitate him in <HI>do∣ing good,</HI> as much as possibly they can; to be sure <HI>Ministers of the Gospel</HI> should do so. And it must needs be reckon'd a good work, not only to morti∣fie our own lusts and corruptions (which we should chiefly and constantly endeavour to do) but also to prevent and suppress Sin in others, as much as possibly we can. Tis <HI>Brotherly, Neighbour∣ly</HI> kindness, to <HI>reprove</HI> others for and caution them against Sin, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19 17. We should especially wit∣ness against, and endeavour to put a stop to, <HI>growing threatning Evils;</HI> and among <HI>Sundry such</HI> evils in our Land; I reckon <HI>Excessive Drinking</HI> to be one. I therefore thought it proper and seasonable, to bear some Testimony against this growing wick∣edness;
<PB N="2" REF="001491_0002_0FB34FE26F7A9638"/>
by offering some few considerations, to those who <HI>needlesly frequent Taverns;</HI> and also to <HI>Tavern-keepers,</HI> or to those who <HI>Retail Drink,</HI> whe∣ther they are <HI>Innholders</HI> or not Yet lest I should be mis-interpreted, or be thought to run into ex∣treams; I'll readily grant,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the keeping of Taverns, or Houses of Enter∣tainment, is not only lawful, but also very useful and convenient.</HI> The proper end and use of <HI>Taverns, Inns Ale-houses, Victualing-houses,</HI> or <HI>Houses of Entertain∣ment,</HI> in general, is, the <HI>accommodating of Strangers and Travellers.</HI> If Persons had no occasion to be far from home, there would be no occasion or∣dinarily for <HI>Taverns.</HI> But the necessary business of many (yea of most at one time or other) calls them to be abroad, <HI>Journeying</HI> or <HI>Trading</HI> far from home. Now when Persons are thus distant from home, Houses of Entertainment are needful, to accommodate them with <HI>Victuals, Drink, Lodgings, &amp;c.</HI> I grant,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Town-dwellers who are nigh home, may some∣times, have proper occasions to go into Taverns, and stay a while there.</HI> No doubt but such Town-dwellers (especially those who have most <HI>business</HI> with <HI>Strangers and Travellers</HI>) may sometimes have real business at <HI>Taverns,</HI> and so have proper occa∣sion to go thither for the doing of it. And no doubt but when their business calls them there, they may allowably buy and use, what drink is proper and needful for their <HI>Refreshment.</HI></P>
<P>I grant,</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That the use of Strong Drink, yea of Strong Spirits, is not only Lawful, but in some cases convenient.</HI> I verily believe, that various sorts of Strong Drink are greatly abus'd in this Land, and <HI>Rum</HI> especi∣ally. But tho' many abuse these things, it does
<PB N="3" REF="001491_0003_0FB34FE4E73D6518"/>
not thence follow that 'tis unlawful to use them. I grant that even <HI>Distill'd Spirits</HI> may do good, when taken only in a moderate quantity, and only at such times or seasons, when there is <HI>proper oc∣casion</HI> for them. But tho' I readily grant these three things but now mention'd, yet I verily be∣lieve, that multitudes of Persons in this Land, are very criminal and blame-worthy; for their <HI>need∣less haunting of Drinking-houses,</HI> and spending their Time and Money there. Now out of hearty re∣gard to the glory of God, the good of the Publick, and the benefit of such faulty Persons; I would Intreat, Exhort and Urge, those who are thus blame-worthy, to reform such their ill practices. Don't frequent <HI>Taverns</HI> (or any <HI>Drinking houses,</HI> be they call'd by what name they will) don't spend your time, nor Money there, unless there be some <HI>real occasion,</HI> some <HI>real business</HI> that calls you so to do. The Exhortation is,
<Q>Don't needlessly Spend your Time nor Money, at Drinking-houses.</Q></P>
<P>To move you to a compliance with this Exhor∣tation▪ consider, by thus doing,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You Sinfully Spend your</HI> TIME, <HI>which you must give an account to God for.</HI> 'Tis in God you live, move and have your being; he holds your Souls in Life, and preserves your Spirits; every breath you draw, is a renew'd Instance of Divine Mer∣cy. God who thus lengthens out your <HI>Time,</HI> re∣quires that the whole of it should be so Imploy'd, as to bring glory to his Name. God said of Isra∣el, Deut. 4.10. <HI>I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to</HI> FEAR ME ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY SHALL LIVE UPON THE EARTH. You should Fear, Serve and Glorifie
<PB N="4" REF="001491_0004_0FB34FE61E5C3780"/>
God, <HI>all the time of your Life upon Earth</HI> And God will call you to an account, <HI>How you spend your Time,</HI> and for what you do upon Earth. 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>For we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> Well, and what account can you give to God, of the Time needlesly (and therefore <HI>Sinfully</HI>) spent in <HI>Taverns?</HI> Oh how doleful will your account be, if speedy hearty Repentance does not prevent? If that Time you <HI>needlesly</HI> spent in <HI>Taverns,</HI> had been spent in <HI>Reading Gods Word,</HI> in holy <HI>Meditâtion,</HI> in earnest <HI>Prayer</HI> to God for Spiritual Blessings; how much would it have been, for the good of your precious Immortal Souls, and for your Joyful account in the day of Judgment? Such needless spending of Time and Money,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Wrongs your Outward Estates.</HI> All Christians, should be <HI>diligent</HI> in some lawful business. <HI>Idle∣ness</HI> it self is a great Sin, and leads to many Sins. You should be, <HI>Not slothful in business,</HI> Rom. 12.11. The <HI>Slothful,</HI> is called the <HI>Wicked,</HI> Servant; in our Lords Parable, <HI>Mat</HI> 25 26. The Inspired Apostle says, 1 Thes 4 11, 12 — <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands as we commanded you — that ye may have lack of nothing.</HI> Eph. 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. — <HI>Let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</HI> These plain commands of God you break, by needless frequenting of <HI>Taverns.</HI> You not only <HI>neglect</HI> diligent proper means, ho∣nestly to <HI>Increase</HI> your Outward Estate (which might render you <HI>more Serviceable</HI> and Useful) but you also <HI>diminish</HI> and lessen what you have. And if you Estates can bear such expences at present;
<PB N="5" REF="001491_0005_0FB34FE79EEF24C8"/>
yet the course you follow, tends to <HI>Poverty:</HI> Prov. 23.21. <HI>The Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</HI> Tis easy to give many Instances, of Persons who had competent Estates, good Business, good Re∣putation, and in likely way to thrive honestly in the World; who by frequenting of <HI>Taverns,</HI> have been brought to Poverty. And if your ill course in frequenting Taverns, brings you into low, strait, impoverish'd circumstances; then these (among other) mischiefs are like to follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You will be unable to pay your just Debts to those you deal with.</HI> Gods command is, Rom. 13 8. <HI>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</HI> The Pro∣phet said to the Widow, 2 King 4 7. <HI>Pay thy Debt,</HI> Psal. 37.21. <HI>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</HI> Men are <HI>wicked,</HI> if they dont do their utmost to <HI>Pay their just Debts;</HI> but your ill course renders you unable to pay such Debts, therefore your wicked course puts you on further wickedness. You imploy that to Serve the Devil, and gratifie your lusts; which should go to satisfie your Cre∣ditors. This is mischievous wickedness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>You can't do what you should, to Support the State and Government.</HI> Rom. 13.7 <HI>Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom,</HI> &amp;c. Those who Serve the Publick, should be paid by the Publick; <HI>Rates</HI> and <HI>Taxes</HI> are necessary to be paid, for the Publick Service, and to Support the State. But your Poverty pro∣cur'd by your wickedness, renders you unable to do your part in this Duty.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>You can't do what you should, to Maintain Gods Publick Worship.</HI> The divine command is, Gal. 6.6. <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</HI> Prov. 3.9. <HI>Honour
<PB N="6" REF="001491_0006_0FB34FE9207F9C50"/>
the Lord with thy Substance.</HI> Tis the undeniable Du∣ty of Christians, to pay out of their Estates what's needful, for the honourable Support of Gods Wor∣ship and Ministry. But your Sinful spending what you have, renders you unable to do this Duty. By wickedly spending what you have, you <HI>Serve the Devil</HI> instead of <HI>Honouring the Lord,</HI> with your <HI>Substance.</HI> The <HI>Poverty</HI> which your <HI>Sin</HI> procures, not only makes you <HI>defraud Men</HI> but also <HI>rob God;</HI> you are guilty of <HI>Sacriledge,</HI> Mal. 3.8— 10. Possibly I may be Scoff'd and Mock'd at for this, by the <HI>Intemperate</HI> and <HI>Profane;</HI> but if I am, I'le indeavour to bear it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>You can't Support and Maintain your own Fami∣lies.</HI> Many Families are greatly impoverish'd, brought into necessitous pinching circumstances; because the heads of them <HI>haunt Taverns,</HI> live Idly, spend their Time and Money in <HI>Drinking, Gaming</HI> and other vicious practices. What shall I say to you that are thus guilty? I say! Nay hear what God says, 1 Tim. 5.8. <HI>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house; he hath denyed the faith, and is worse than an Infidel.</HI> It may be you would be vex'd with me, if I should call you <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Infidels;</HI> but God says, you are <HI>worse than such</HI> For many <HI>Heathen</HI> carefully pro∣vide for their Families, but you wickedly neglect yours. IF Gods Word may be regarded (and surely it should) you don't deserve to be call'd <HI>Christians,</HI> but to be call'd <HI>worse than Infidels.</HI> Nay, <HI>the Sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones,</HI> Lam 4.3. Birds and Beasts will feed their Young Ones; therefore you act much worse than they, if you suffer your Wives and Fa∣milies, your poor Children, to want what's need∣ful, while you wickedly spend your Time and Money at <HI>Drinking-Houses.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="7" REF="001491_0007_0FB34FEA9F8D58C8"/>5. <HI>You become burdensome to your honest Neighbours.</HI> When by your wicked Impoverishing courses, you come to be very low, have nothing before hand, and it may be much in debt too; if God should now send <HI>Sickness</HI> on you and your Fami∣lies, why you must perish if your charitable Neighbours did not help you. Those that were <HI>Sweating</HI> while you were <HI>Drinking;</HI> diligently <HI>Working</HI> while you were <HI>Idling,</HI> and <HI>Playing;</HI> those who were <HI>Frugal, Diligent</HI> and <HI>Prudent,</HI> while you acted like <HI>Prodigals;</HI> must now Support you and yours, else you would perish. And what a shame is it, that you should be thus burdensome? These few hints show, that the course you take, tends to destroy your Outward Estates, and so it brings <HI>many mischiefs.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the course you take,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hurts your Reputation.</HI> It's probable that your own Idle companions that are as bad as your selves, won't dislike you for your ill courses; but all Persons of true worth and virtue, will dis∣esteem you and think meanly of you, for them. Tis part of a good mans character, Psal. 15.4. <HI>In whose eyes a vile Person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</HI> Now I'm sure 'tis <HI>Vile</HI> and Sinful, for Persons <HI>needlesly</HI> to spend their Time and Money at <HI>Taverns.</HI> And if such a course brings them (as it has done many) to be <HI>gross common Drunkards;</HI> then they must needs be <HI>Con∣temptable,</HI> even in the eyes of <HI>Sober Heathens,</HI> as well as of good Christians. To see a Person thro' excess of Drink, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Staggering, Yawning, Sla∣vering, Wallowing in his Vomit;</HI> or so <HI>Stupify'd that he can't move any more than a log;</HI> what a <HI>contempta∣ble loathsome object is it?</HI> They that have any vir∣tue, will surely contemn those that are thus vici∣ous.
<PB N="8" REF="001491_0008_0FB34FEC1F619990"/>
A <HI>Drunken Sot,</HI> deserves to be <HI>contemned. Solomon</HI> tells us, Prov. 3.35. <HI>Shame shall be the promotion of Fools.</HI> The ill course you follow,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Is hurtful to your</HI> BODIES. God says, Exod. 21.13. <HI>Thou shalt not Kill.</HI> When the <HI>Jaylor</HI> would have kill'd himself. <HI>Paul</HI> cry'd out, Act. 16.28. <HI>Do thy self no harm.</HI> You should give heed to these things. Self-Murder, is an hainous and cry∣ing Iniquity; I believe many <HI>Tavern-haunters</HI> are guilty of it. No doubt but many kill themselves as <HI>Surely,</HI> tho' not so <HI>Suddenly,</HI> by Intemperance, as if they should run themselves thro' with a Sword. Prov. 23.32. <HI>At the last it biteth like a Serpent, and stingeth like an Adder.</HI> Excess, <HI>Poysons</HI> them; it brings <HI>many Distempers,</HI> and at last kills them. I think 'tis easy to observe, that many who haunt Taverns, and habituate themselves to intemperate Drinking; do gradually <HI>lose their Stomachs, their Appetite is gone, they can eat little or nothing;</HI> they are <HI>Bloated, Weak,</HI> they become in a great measure <HI>benum'd, doz'd, listless, and so not fit for any business of Body or Mind,</HI> and so languish till they drop into the Grave. According to the different <HI>Age, Constitution</HI> and <HI>Imployment</HI> of <HI>Tiplers,</HI> some thus destroy and murder themselves in a shorter, and some in a longer time. I suppose twould be easy to give instances of Persons (and to <HI>Name</HI> them if it would not look Invidious) that by excessive drinking of <HI>Rum,</HI> have been brought into <HI>Lan∣guishing Circumstances;</HI> yet they have so <HI>crav'd Rum,</HI> that they could not be without it. It may be every quarter of an hour (or very frequently) they must have it, they are fainting and gasping without it, and yet the taking it kills them. I have heard sundry <HI>Skilful Physitians</HI> say, that the <HI>Customary or frequent use of Rum, Brandy,</HI> or indeed
<PB N="9" REF="001491_0009_0FB34FED9E5D6448"/>
any <HI>distill'd Spirits,</HI> hinders the <HI>digestion of Food, spoils the Appetite,</HI> begets a <HI>vicious craving,</HI> after Spirits; and yet to <HI>gratify</HI> this <HI>craving,</HI> is very hurtful to the body, destroy <HI>natural Heat,</HI> and tends directly to <HI>destroy Life</HI> Oh, how many have thus Murder'd themselves! Those who destroy their <HI>Estates,</HI> or <HI>Reputation,</HI> or <HI>Lives,</HI> by Intempe∣rance, are so far the <HI>Devils Martyrs.</HI> They suffer these things in his Service, and for his cause. Sa∣tans service is costly to them <HI>in this World,</HI> besides what's coming in the Other. But besides this <HI>gradual way of killing</HI> by Intemperance, Drunkards wofully expose themselves to many <HI>fearful Acci∣dents.</HI> That saying, <HI>That Drunkards get no harm,</HI> is the <HI>Devils Proverb,</HI> 'tis false, 'tis a lye. Inspired <HI>Solomon</HI> in his Proverbs says, Prov. 23.29, 30, 34. <HI>Who hath We? who hath Sorrow? who hath Contenti∣ons? who hath Babling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of Eyes? They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to seek mix'd Wine— Yea thou shalt be as he that lyeth down in the midst of the Sea, or as he that lyeth on the top of a Mast.</HI> How many Instances might be given, of those who when <HI>Drunken</HI> have met with <HI>Falls, Wounds, Bruises, broken Bones?</HI> Have not some slept abroad in their Drunken fits, got Cold, Sicken'd and dy'd upon it? How many have been found <HI>Dead abroad,</HI> when a <HI>dark Night, cold Season,</HI> or <HI>sore Storm</HI> has met with them in their <HI>Drunken fits?</HI> Many have <HI>dy'd in Drink,</HI> and where do you think their Souls are? But again, by the course you take,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>You are in danger of being led into</HI> OTHER SINS. One Sin often leads to others, and smaller offences make way for greater. It may be tho' you needlesly frequent Drinking-houses, yet at present you are reckon'd <HI>Sober Persons;</HI> you are
<PB N="10" REF="001491_0010_0FB34FEF224CAF78"/>
no Swearers, you are no Drunkards so as to <HI>Reel, Stagger, Spew</HI> as the <HI>common Sots</HI> do; well if it be so, yet you are in an ill course, and there's ap∣parent danger of your growing much worse. If you are not <HI>Profane Swearers,</HI> yet possibly at <HI>Ta∣verns,</HI> you may meet with some <HI>Sons of Belial,</HI> some children of the Devil <HI>Cursing, Swearing, Dam∣ning,</HI> as if they were <HI>dating God to destroy them.</HI> And by your needlesly coming into such Com∣pany, and hearing such hellish abominable words; who knows how far you may be left to Imitate them? And if you are not <HI>Staggering Drunken Sots</HI> already, 'tis to be fear'd the course you take, will bring you to it. It may be when you have been Sitting and Drinking a while, and are about to go home; then there comes in some other Neighbour, and so you'll stay some-what longer, to have a <HI>Pot,</HI> or <HI>Pint,</HI> or <HI>Jill</HI> with him, and thus you gradually proceed from bad to worse. And pos∣sibly in a little time, you'll come to be really buz'd, really overcome with Drink, <HI>really Drunk.</HI> And what a figure will you make then? what are you good for, or fit for, in your drunken fit? why, for no good to be sure. You are not fit for any Service for God or Man; you're only fit to Serve the Devil. If <HI>Children</HI> are <HI>Gluttons</HI> and <HI>Drun∣kards,</HI> no wonder if they are <HI>Stubborn and Rebellious,</HI> Deut. 21.20. Drunkenness has various effects on men; some in their Drunkenness, act like <HI>Fawning, Flattering, Slavering Fools,</HI> they seem mighty <HI>Loving</HI> and <HI>Good humour'd.</HI> Others in their Drunken fits, are much for <HI>Discoursing and disputing about Religi∣ous things,</HI> and it may be will <HI>Weep</HI> and seem <HI>much affected</HI> with them. I believe the <HI>Devil</HI> prompts them very much to this, that if possible, he may render Religion <HI>Ridiculous and Odious,</HI> and <HI>Prejudice
<PB N="11" REF="001491_0011_0FB34FF0A0CE6060"/>
others against it.</HI> Some in their Drunken fits, are like <HI>raving mad Dogs,</HI> are ready to <HI>quarrel and fight with any they meet with.</HI> To such an one we might well apply, Prov. 17.12. <HI>Let a Bear robbed of her Whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</HI> When men are drunk, how often do they <HI>Quarrel, Fight, Wound, Bruise, Maim</HI> one another; and hurt <HI>Sober Persons</HI> that come in their way? Nay, sometimes they'll cruelly beat their own <HI>Wives, Children,</HI> or <HI>best Friends.</HI> Yea very many <HI>Murders</HI> have been committed, by Persons in their <HI>Drunken fits.</HI> A few Months ago, <HI>Two men were Executed at Bristol,</HI> for being <HI>guilty of Murder</HI> in their <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> One in the County of <HI>Middle-sex,</HI> was last Summer <HI>try'd for his Life,</HI> for <HI>Killing a Man,</HI> (even a <HI>Kinsman</HI> too) when both they and others had been Intemperately <HI>Drinking together.</HI> 'Twould be easy to give many instances, of <HI>Mur∣ders committed by men in Drink.</HI> Alas, when men are <HI>depriv'd of Reason</HI> by <HI>Excess of Drink,</HI> what wickedness are they afraid or asham'd of? They'll sometimes <HI>Curse, Swear,</HI> be <HI>Unclean, Fight,</HI> &amp;c. There's scarce any wickedness that they'll scru∣ple, or boggle at. <HI>Nabal</HI> in his <HI>Drunken fit,</HI> did <HI>Rail</HI> at <HI>David</HI> and his <HI>Messengers,</HI> 1 Sam. 25.10, 11, 14, 37. <HI>David</HI> says, Psal. 69 12. <HI>I was the song of the Drunkard.</HI> Drunken Sots, wont scruple to rail at and revile, the best <HI>Persons,</HI> and the best Things. <HI>Lot</HI> was a <HI>good Man,</HI> yet his Daughters wickedly and purposely made him <HI>Drunk;</HI> and when he was <HI>Drunk,</HI> he did <HI>commit Incest with both of them,</HI> Gen. 19.32—38 Oh dreadful, Oh horrible wickedness committed thro' Drunken∣ness! Be astonish'd O Heavens, at such things as these. I was lately told some <HI>Expressions,</HI> which a <HI>Church-Member, Spake in a Drunken sot;</HI> the ex∣pressions
<PB N="12" REF="001491_0012_0FB34FF21F4F5D98"/>
were (to say the least) very <HI>Profane;</HI> yea I think they might be truly call'd <HI>Blasphe∣mous;</HI> when he became <HI>Sober</HI> (I was told) he was <HI>Reprov'd</HI> and <HI>Confess'd his fault.</HI> I mention this, for the <HI>cautioning and warning of Church-Mem∣bers,</HI> as well as others. Tis very criminal and wicked, to <HI>revile Church-Members in general</HI> (as too many are apt to do) for the <HI>gross faults com∣mitted by some.</HI> Yet as to particular Persons, if they indulge themselves in <HI>Drunkenness and so fall into other Scandals;</HI> therein they act more like <HI>Heathen or Brutes,</HI> than as becomes the <HI>Members of our Holy Lord Jesus.</HI> Surely any one that <HI>thinks,</HI> and will take the pains to <HI>consider,</HI> will readily grant, that <HI>Drunkenness leads to other Sins.</HI> I shall therefore add no more on this head, but only Subjoyn part of the <HI>Confession</HI> made by a man, who was executed above twenty years ago in this place, for a <HI>Murder</HI> he committed when <HI>he was in drink:</HI> The <HI>Confession</HI> was <HI>Printed,</HI> with a Ser∣mon Preach'd by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> on that occasion. The Confession runs thus,</P>
<P><Q>I <HI>James Morgan,</HI> being condemned to dye, must needs own to the glory of God, that he is righteous, and that I have by my Sins provoked him to destroy me <HI>before my time.</HI> I have been a <HI>great</HI> Sinner, guilty of <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> of <HI>Ly∣ing,</HI> and of <HI>Uncleaness;</HI> but there are especially <HI>two</HI> Sins, whereby I have of∣fended the Great God; one is, the Sin of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> which has caused me to
<PB N="13" REF="001491_0013_0FB34FF3A0423590"/>
commit many <HI>other</HI> Sins. For when in drink, I have been often guilty of <HI>Cursing and Swearing,</HI> &amp; quarrelling, and striking others. But the Sin that lies <HI>most heavy</HI> upon my Conscience is, That <HI>I have des∣pised the Word of God,</HI> and many a time <HI>refused to bear it Preached.</HI> For these things, I believe God has left me to that, which has brought me to a shameful &amp; miserable Death. I do therefore beseech and warn all Persons, <HI>Young</HI> men <HI>especi∣ally</HI> to take heed of these Sins, lest they provoke the Lord to do to them as He has justly done by me.</Q></P>
<P>To proceed, the course you take,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Will very much hurt your Families.</HI> I don't here refer to your <HI>Impoverishing</HI> of them, (I spake to that before) but to the want of good <HI>Order, In∣struction, Discipline, Religious Worship</HI> among them. Some who <HI>haunt Taverns,</HI> do stay out <HI>very late at Night;</HI> this disorders the Family. It may be when you come from the Tavern <HI>very late,</HI> the most part of your Family are <HI>gone to bed;</HI> or if not, yet they're so <HI>Sleepy and Drouzy,</HI> they can scarce keep <HI>Awake</HI> to attend <HI>Family Prayer.</HI> But in truth, I doubt, that those who needlesly <HI>haunt Taverns,</HI> have little (if any) regard, to <HI>Instruct</HI> their Families in Religion, to <HI>Read Gods Word</HI> to them, and to <HI>Pray in their Families Morning and Evening.</HI> But very great is your wickedness, if you neglect these plain necessary duties. Yet how unfit are you for these duties, when you have

been with <HI>Idle Companions,</HI> chatting where you had no call nor business, and <HI>Drinking</HI> (to say the least) <HI>more than you had need of?</HI> Nay it may be, if you stay out late, when you come home, Instead of <HI>Praying</HI> with your Families, there's <HI>Vexing, Fretting, Scolding,</HI> if not <HI>Fighting</HI> too; occasion'd by your base irregular practices. I pity those poor <HI>Wives, Children, Servants;</HI> who dwell in such woful Fa∣milies. What's like to become of those poor <HI>Young Ones,</HI> who have such <HI>Vile Examples</HI> set before them, and are brought up in such <HI>disorderly Fami∣lies?</HI> Such vile disorders, tend to <HI>breed up a Generation fit for no good.</HI> If the <HI>head of the Fami∣ly</HI> is abroad very unseasonably, <HI>very late,</HI> if he's <HI>Intemperate,</HI> if he will call <HI>ill Names,</HI> speak <HI>vile Words, Curse and Swear Profanely;</HI> is he likely (do you think) rightly to <HI>Reprove</HI> or <HI>Reform</HI> what's amiss, in his <HI>Children</HI> or <HI>Servants?</HI> Nay if persons don't <HI>frequent Taverns,</HI> but do in <HI>Private Houses</HI> stay out unseasonably; spending all or most part of the Night, in <HI>Gaming, Tipling</HI> and other wick∣ed practices, tis much the same thing, as to the <HI>Hurting and Disordering their Families.</HI></P>
<P>Again Consider,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The course you take, may prove, very Injurious to your Neighbours round about you.</HI> Ill examples, are very Influential and pernicious. <HI>A little Lea∣ven, leaveneth the whole Lump,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.6. <HI>Lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and thereby</HI> MANY BE DEFILED, Heb. 12.15.

Why we should soon be a Land of <HI>Tiplers, Sots, Drunkards, Extreamly wicked and utterly miserable.</HI> The Lord be Merciful to us, shall this be the <HI>Doom of Poor New-England?</HI> God forbid. Well then, <HI>Don't Set ill Examples before others.</HI> If you are not gross Drunkards already, yet your <HI>needless haun∣ting of Taverns,</HI> may be unspeakably pernicious to others. I have heard of sundry <HI>Younger Persons,</HI> who being <HI>blam'd</HI> for being needlesly and unsea∣sonably at <HI>Taverns;</HI> did alledge for their <HI>Vindica∣tion,</HI> the <HI>Example</HI> of such and such Persons of some note and figure, either for their <HI>Age, Office, Church-Membership, Sobriety,</HI> &amp;c. How sorrowful is it, that the <HI>Example</HI> of any such should hurt others▪ I therefore earnestly Intreat and Beseech those (high or low, rich or poor) who make any con∣siderable <HI>Figure,</HI> or are of any <HI>Tolerable Note</HI> on Character, for <HI>Age, Office, Church Membership, Sobrie∣ty,</HI> &amp;c. that they would as much as with any <HI>Conveniency</HI> they may, avoid <HI>Tavern-haunting;</HI> lest <HI>Younger, Looser, Inconsiderate</HI> Persons, should by their <HI>Example</HI> be led into the <HI>Snares of the Destroy∣er.</HI> To those who needlesly frequent <HI>Taverns,</HI> I would say <HI>Once more,</HI></P>

<HI>Take heed to your selves, lest</HI> AT ANY TIME <HI>your hearts be over-charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</HI> Verily you should <HI>take heed.</HI> 1 Thes. 5.6. — <HI>Watch and be Sober.</HI> Eph. 5.18. <HI>Be not Drunk with Wine, wherein is excess▪ but be filled with the Spirit.</HI> Excess of Wine or other Strong Drink, provokes the <HI>Holy Spirit of God.</HI> And if that <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> should no more Strive with and help you, you are undone for ever.

<P>I would now proceed.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To offer some Advice, to all that Keep Houses of Entertainment,</HI> and <HI>that Retail Drink.</HI> And my Advice and Exhortation is, <HI>That you do by no means Incourage or Indulge Intemperance, in any person whatsoever.</HI> It may be you are desirous to Sell Drink, for your own <HI>Gain;</HI> but you should not do this to your <HI>Neighbours hurt.</HI> You should <HI>Love your Neighbours as your selves,</HI> do as you could <HI>(rea∣sonably)</HI> desire to be done by; you should desire your Neighbours <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Welfare</HI> as well as your own, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.4. These are plain commanded Du∣ties, therefore you should make Conscience of do∣ing them. And for this reason, you should <HI>never Incourage</HI> any of your <HI>Neighbours</HI> or <HI>Customers,</HI> need∣lesly to <HI>spend their time and money with you.</HI> Nay you should not <HI>Indulge</HI> them in so doing. If you Incourage or Indulge their sin, thereby you be∣come <HI>partakers in their guilt.</HI> According to God's Law, he that <HI>can</HI> prevent mischief and <HI>does not,</HI> is to be <HI>Punish'd</HI> as if he <HI>himself did it,</HI> Exod. 21.19. God threatens those particularly, who <HI>further Drun∣kenness in others,</HI> Hab. 2.15. <HI>Wo unto him that giveth his Neighbour drink; that puttest thy Bottle to him &amp; makest him Drunken also.</HI> Remember this the great God denounceth <HI>Woe</HI> against those who make their <HI>Neighbours Drunk.</HI> And will you for the gaining
<PB N="18" REF="001491_0018_0FB34FFC10E02120"/>
of a little Money, expose your selves to this Woe? What, <HI>do you provoke the Lord to Jealousie? Are you stronger than he?</HI> 1 Cor. 10.22. When you incou∣rage or indulge your Neighbours, in the <HI>mispence of time and money</HI> with you; as you <HI>provoke God</HI> and incur his displeasure, so you greatly <HI>wrong your Neighbours too.</HI> If you should Steal a <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>Sixpence</HI> from him, this would be a plain breach of the <HI>Eighth Commandment;</HI> yet this Theft would not so much hurt your Neighbour, as your Selling him so many Peny-worth of Drink if you be (as doubt∣less you often are) morally sure, that he'll be <HI>Drunk with it.</HI> For when your Neighbour thus gets <HI>Drunk,</HI> he not only has spent his <HI>Money,</HI> but he <HI>hurts his Body and Soul</HI> too, with what his money paid for. By reading what I have already said to <HI>Tavern haunters,</HI> you may see how <HI>sinful</HI> and <HI>dan∣gerous</HI> their course is; therefore if you incourage or connive at such practices in them; you are in a great degree, chargeable with the <HI>sin and mischief attending them.</HI> When you incourage their mispence of time and money, you then further them, in hurting their <HI>Estates,</HI> their <HI>Credit,</HI> their <HI>Families,</HI> and their <HI>Bodies and Souls</HI> too; yea in <HI>hurting the Publick</HI> and that various ways. If when you owe your Neighbours a small matter, you urge them to <HI>take it out in your way;</HI> that is, <HI>to drink it out</HI> tho' they have no need of it; this is very wicked in you. They had better <HI>lose their Debt,</HI> than get it in such a manner. If when <HI>Constables</HI> come to clear your Houses, as the Law directs; you <HI>hide your wicked Customers,</HI> deny that they are there, and so encourage their staying to <HI>Tipple, Game, &amp;c.</HI> then you do very wickedly; your sin is greatly <HI>Aggra∣vated.</HI> You do wickedly, to indulge any sorts of persons, whether <HI>Heads of Families, Sons</HI> or <HI>Servants,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001491_0019_0FB34FFD5E0F4C18"/>
needlesly to spend their time and money in your Houses. But it seems something of an <HI>Aggrava∣tion</HI> of your sin, when you suffer your <HI>Poor</HI> Neighbours, <HI>Tradesmen, Labourours,</HI> to do so; when you know their <HI>Poor Families want Necessaries.</HI> It may be they have scarce <HI>Victuals to feed them;</HI> scarce <HI>Fire or Cloathes to warm them.</HI> Those men who spend their money at Taverns, while their <HI>Wives, Children</HI> or <HI>Servants</HI> thus suffer; are worse than brutish; and you act <HI>Inhumanely, Barbarously, Cruelly</HI> (not to say <HI>Murderously</HI>) in indulging them in such Cursed practices. Indeed you are bound in Duty and Conscience, to oppose and hinder as far as you can, any persons mispending his time or money in your Houses. If any <HI>would</HI> be so dis∣orderly in your Houses, you should kindly and friendly advise them to desist, and be gone; tell them how hurtful their practice is. If such gentle means won't prevail, yet you may <HI>refuse to let them have drink;</HI> you may take methods, to hin∣der their wickedness if you will. Possibly you'll <HI>Object,</HI> this is the way to <HI>lose your Custom,</HI> you <HI>can't Live after this rate.</HI> To this, the answer is short and plain, You had <HI>better lose your Custom, thou mischief your own Souls, and the Souls and Bodies of your Neighbours;</HI> which you do, if you indulge their wickedness. The Gain you get by indulg∣ing Sin, is <HI>Unrighteous Gain;</HI> and that exposeth to the Wrath and Vengeance of God, whatever you may think of it at present. Remember therefore the account you must give to God, in the Judg∣ment Day; and let that restrain you, from incou∣raging or indulging Intemperance (or any other sin) in any person whatsoever.</P>
<P>From the Premises, I think the following In∣ferences are plain, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="20" REF="001491_0020_0FB34FFEDF67CF68"/>1. <HI>That none but Persons of approv'd Sobriety and good Conversation, should have Licenses to Retail Drink, espe∣cially to be Inn holders.</HI> If Vicious Immoral persons, who have little or no Conscience, come to be <HI>Inn-holders;</HI> they will allow of vile Disorders, <HI>Swearing, Gaming, Drunkenness▪</HI> they won't care how much they <HI>Impoverish</HI> &amp; <HI>Debauch</HI> their Neighbours, if they can but <HI>Gain by it</HI> themselves. Yea, the <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> in such Houses, are in great danger of being utterly Ruined I reckon such <HI>Inn-holders</HI> are very <HI>Extensive Plagues and Mischiefs to the Publick</HI> They are more dangerous to the Pub∣lick, than so many <HI>Indians on the Frontiers,</HI> or a <HI>Pri∣vateer on the Coast;</HI> for these open Enemies can do no more (at worst) but <HI>Kill the Body;</HI> but such <HI>Inn-holders</HI> won't scruple, to destroy the <HI>Estates, Cre∣dit, Bodies</HI> and <HI>Immortal Souls of their Neighbours.</HI> Sometimes <HI>one base Fellow in a Town</HI> (tho' in a pri∣vate Capacity) does a world of Mischief, by tempting corrupting and debauching his Neigh∣bours, <HI>Young Ones</HI> especially; but if such an one <HI>Keeps Tavern,</HI> hee'l probably do more abundant mischief. Therefore those who have power to <HI>Grant Licenses,</HI> as they have any regard to God's Glory and the good of this Land; <HI>should Consci∣enciously take heed, not to grant them to Unsuitable Persons.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The needless multiplying of Licenses to Sell Drink, especially to be Innholders, directly tends to debauch and ruin this People.</HI> If a grieved Con∣science (concern'd for the Publick good) might have liberty to Speak; I humbly conceive, that <HI>Licenses</HI> are so multiplyed (especially in some Pla∣ces) that those who have them can get no tolera∣ble gain by them, unless their Neighbours prove <HI>Wicked</HI> Customers, in spending <HI>more Money</HI> with
<PB N="21" REF="001491_0021_0FB3500060B8D0D8"/>
them than they should. When men have <HI>Licenses,</HI> they're under a Temptation to Sell what Drink they can; tho' they know their Neighbours do <HI>Wickedly,</HI> in buying <HI>so much</HI> as they do. And the <HI>Poorer</HI> those are that have <HI>Licenses,</HI> the greater are their Temptations to allow ill practices in others, for their own gain. It may be a Man has met with <HI>Losses,</HI> or his <HI>Trade Fails,</HI> he's become low and indigent; the next thing is, he seeks a <HI>License to Sell Drink;</HI> and when he has it, possibly many of his Neighbours ruin themselves, by being his <HI>Wicked Customers.</HI> I fear <HI>many</HI> are <HI>made</HI> poor, by being <HI>Wicked</HI> Customers to others, that were poor <HI>before them.</HI> If those really poor and low, would <HI>Keep good Consciences;</HI> I think they had better follow the hardest labour their Bodies can bear, and be content to live very meanly; than to get a License to Sell Drink: for their Temptations would be very great. How many have reason to rue the day, that they got such Licenses? I doubt Li∣censes are so <HI>Multiplied,</HI> that few who have them can get a gain answerable to their Charge and Trouble, and <HI>Keep good Consciences too.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>All that desire the Glory of God and the good of this People, should do their utmost in their several Ca∣pacities to Suppress Intemperance.</HI> Those in Civil Authority, should Imploy their power against this threatening Vice, as well as against others; else they are not a <HI>Terror to Evil doers,</HI> Rom. 13.3. I reckon there's great need also, that all <HI>Ministers</HI> thro' the Land, should very <HI>Plainly, Publickly</HI> and <HI>Particularly,</HI> bear their Witness against this grow∣ing and threatning Evil. <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Familes</HI> should watch over their <HI>Young Ones,</HI> not suffer them to <HI>haunt Taverns,</HI> nor drink to Excess. They should not teach their Children, their <HI>Boys and Girls to
<PB N="22" REF="001491_0022_0FB35001E4BC6B40"/>
drink Rum,</HI> (as I have heard some very <HI>Foolishly &amp; Sinfully do.</HI>) In short, all that are Sober and well-minded, should in love and faithfulness Watch over their Neighbours, Exhorting, Re∣proving, Admonishing as their is occasion; for the Preventing and Suppressing of this growing wickedness.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>All that desire the good of this Land, should earnestly Pray for the Out-pourings of the Spirit of Christ.</HI> God is various ways contending with us. He has punish'd us by a long War, which has cost us much Treasure and Blood. The last Summer we met with a disappointment, which was very chargeable and expensive to us; at the same time also, God sorely chasten'd us with a very <HI>Severe Drought.</HI> God is come out against us in the Way of his Judgments; Surely we should be in <HI>Good earnest,</HI> to reform what's amiss among us. We should not only <HI>Talk</HI> of a <HI>Reformation,</HI> but <HI>dili∣gently &amp; heartily Indeavour it.</HI> Therefore we should <HI>Earnestly Pray,</HI> that God would <HI>Pour down his Spirit on us;</HI> (tho' we should use the best means we can, yet) nothing short of that, can work a <HI>Real thorow Reformation.</HI> If every serious Person in the Land, would <HI>heartily and constant∣ly Pray for this great blessing,</HI> 'twould be a <HI>Token for good,</HI> Psal. 85.4 8. <HI>Turn us, O God of our Sal∣vation, and cause thine anger towards us to cease — I will hear what God the Lord will Speak: for he will Speak Peace unto his People, and to his Saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE All-seeing Eye of GOD OUR JUDGE Should Restrain us from SIN, and Quicken us to DUTY; urg'd in a Lecture-SERMON, Preached at <HI>Boston,</HI> N. E. <HI>December</HI> 22. 1709.</HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EVERY Creature, is always under the Eye &amp; in the Hand, of God it's Creator; and every Man, must give an account of his carriage to God, who will re∣ward or punish him according to what
<PB N="24" REF="001491_0024_0FB35004E124CD60"/>
his behaviour has been. That every Man shall be thus dealt with, seems evident from the Text now read. In the 5. &amp; 6. <HI>verses,</HI> we have a curse denounc'd against those, who <HI>Trust in Man,</HI> but their <HI>Hearts depart from God.</HI> In the 7. &amp; 8. <HI>verses,</HI> we have a blessing pronounc'd on those, who <HI>Trust and Hope in God.</HI> Tis then added, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>The heart is decietful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?</HI> Some suppose these last words, to refer to the 5. <HI>v.</HI> where a <HI>Curse</HI> is denounc'd against those that <HI>Trust in Man;</HI> as if the Prophet had said, <HI>Man is not fit to be Trusted in,</HI> for his <HI>Heart is very decietful;</HI> he may pretend much kindness, when he intends mischief. O∣thers look on the words of <HI>v.</HI> 9. as some reply to Self flattering Hypocrites, who pretended, that their hearts were right with God and did not depart from him; as if the Prophet had said to such, <HI>Take heed that you be not mistaken,</HI> for the <HI>Heart is decietful,</HI> &amp;c. If this latter be the true meaning, 'tis something like the Apostles caution to every man, <HI>Not to think more highly of himself than he ought,</HI> Rom. 12.3. And that, if he <HI>thinks himself something when he is nothing, he deceives himself,</HI> Gal 6.3. But whether the 9 <HI>v.</HI> refer to the one or other of the fore-mention'd particulars, yet in the end of it 'tis said of Mans heart, <HI>who can know it?</HI> Now the words of our Text, give a compleat full answer to the Question, <HI>God knows the Hearts of all.</HI> Tho' no man knows the hearts of others, nor fully knows his own; tho' he knows not the depth of that decietfulness which is in him; knows not how far he may fall, if he should meet with opportunities and pressing temptations; yet God most fully and compleatly knows, all that is in the hearts of men. He not
<PB N="25" REF="001491_0025_0FB35006792D9E78"/>
only hears all their words, and sees all their out∣ward actions, but is also as fully acquainted with their hearts. The <HI>Heart</HI> and the <HI>Reins,</HI> seem here to signify one and the same thing; even the <HI>Rational Soul; with as it's Motions and Actions.</HI> When men desire to be fully satisfy'd about a matter, they commonly <HI>Inquire, Try,</HI> make <HI>Search,</HI> that so they may come to the bottom of the business. <HI>Job</HI> speaking of himself as <HI>Judge,</HI> says: Job 29 16. <HI>The cause which I know not, I searched out.</HI> In allu∣sion to such <HI>Inquiries</HI> among men, God is here said to <HI>Search</HI> the heart, and <HI>Try</HI> the reins. So he is said, to <HI>Weigh the Spirits,</HI> Prov. 16.2. To <HI>Weigh Actions,</HI> 1 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3. To <HI>Search Jerusalem with Can∣dles,</HI> Zeph. 1.12. Men sometimes light a <HI>Candle,</HI> look into dark holes and corners, to make disco∣very of what they knew not before. Now these things are spoken of God, after the manner of men; they don't signify as tho' God <HI>Took pains,</HI> and did really <HI>Strive</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> to know what is in men; but they note, the most <HI>full compleat knowledge</HI> which God has of all men, and of their hearts. God takes the most exact notice that can be, of what's in the heart of every Man, Woman and Child in the World. And what does God do this for? Why 'tis not as an Idle unconcern'd Spectator, that he critically observes all that's in the hearts of Men, but he does it as a Witness and <HI>Judge;</HI> That he <HI>may give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doing.</HI> To give to <HI>every Man,</HI> it seems then, that <HI>every Man</HI> must have to do with <HI>God as his Judge.</HI> Very of∣ten <HI>in this World,</HI> God deals with Persons in <HI>some measure</HI> according to their ways. He sometimes brings on the <HI>Wicked</HI> very <HI>sore Judgments,</HI> which on some special accounts, are remarkably the <HI>fruit
<PB N="26" REF="001491_0026_0FB35007DE5430D0"/>
of their doings;</HI> and sometimes the Godly meet with blessings, which seem to have a remarkable Relation to their good deeds. I say 'tis <HI>sometimes</HI> thus, yet the Godly and the wicked cannot fully, much less constantly be distinguish'd from one another, by external dispensations of Providence to them, here in this World. <HI>All things come alike to all,</HI> Eccles 9 2. But in the World to come, in the Day of Judgment, then each particular Person shall recieve from God, according to what his heart and ways have been. From our Text there∣fore we may raise this,</P>

If God should with-draw his sustaining power, the Creature would presently sink into its original nothing. Or if God should preserve the Creature in being, yet it could not act, exert or exercise its usual natu∣ral powers, if the Divine Agency or Concourse were with-held. All the actions of the Soul may be call'd <HI>Natural,</HI> as perform'd by the <HI>Rational natural faculties</HI> (whether Supernaturally or Gra∣ciously assisted or not) tho' at the same time they may be call'd <HI>Moral</HI> too, as they refer to the <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of Actions. Now consider'd as <HI>Natural Actions,</HI> a Divine Concourse is absolutely necessa∣ry▪ in order to the performance of them. Divine power actually upholds and assists the faculties of the Soul, in all their operations. And since there is such a Divine Concourse, in all humane actions outward or inward, it necessarily follows, that God knows all the motions and actions even of the Souls of men. For the Soul can do no action without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Divine Concourse, inasmuch therefore as God, power is concern'd in such an action, he
<PB N="28" REF="001491_0028_0FB3500BD8AD1BB0"/>
must needs know all about it. That God knows the hearts of men, is evident,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because he has given Laws, to regulate and govern even the hearts of men.</HI> The Divine law requires us, to <HI>Love</HI> the Lord our God with all our <HI>Heart, Soul, Mind</HI> and <HI>Strength;</HI> and our Neighbour as our selves, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 37—39. It forbids us to <HI>Hate</HI> our Neighbour, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19 17. It bids us <HI>Trust</HI> in God, <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in him, it bids us be <HI>Patient;</HI> and in∣deed multitudes of Divine Precepts, have an Im∣mediate direct reference, to the <HI>Inward Motions of the Soul</HI> which other Men cannot see. Nay indeed all the Commands of God <HI>reach to the Soul,</HI> to the heart; for we should obey and serve God with <HI>all our heart.</HI> Now since God gives laws, to regu∣late even the inward secret actions of the heart, the Soul, it plainly follows, that he knows those inward secret actions; for if he knew them not, his laws would signify nothing, he could not tell when they were kept or broken, and so could not punish or reward Men according to their ways. That God knows the hearts of Men, appears,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From plain direct Assertions in Scripture.</HI> God is a boundless Infinite Being, He's every where Present, and necessarily knows all things. <HI>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the Evil and the good,</HI> Prov 15 3 <HI>There is no Creature that is not manifest in his sight, all things are open and naked, to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb 4.13. Man is a short sighted Creature, ma∣ny things are hid from his eye; but nothing is hid from Gods eye He knows all the outward bodily actions of men, tho' done never so secretly. For the <HI>Darkness hideth not from him, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to him,</HI> Psal. 139.12. Indeed his eyes are
<PB N="29" REF="001491_0029_0FB3500D228032F8"/>
open, <HI>on all the ways</HI> of the Sons of Men, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.19 Men commonly know those things, that are done before their Face, under their eye, they look∣ing on; Well, Gods eyes are <HI>always open,</HI> and that on <HI>all the ways</HI> of the Sons of men. So God knows all the <HI>Words</HI> men speak, tho' never so secretly <HI>Whisper'd:</HI> Psal. 139 4 <HI>There is not a Word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord thou knowest it altogether.</HI> No, <HI>not One word</HI> but what God exactly knows. Tho' 'tis utter'd with the <HI>lowest Whisper,</HI> 'tis as audible to God as <HI>Thunder.</HI> And indeed in the Judgment day, Men shall give an account of <HI>every late Word</HI> they speak, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.36. Men sometimes plot, contrive, cabal to carry on some vile design; possibly they use utmost care to keep the matter <HI>Secret;</HI> but alas, God hears every word about it. But besides all this, God as fully knows the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men, as he does their <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>outward Actions. Solomon</HI> said to God, 1 King 8.39. <HI>Thou even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the Children of Men.</HI> There is not so much as any one of the Children of Men, but God knows his heart. He knows all the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of men, for <HI>no thought can be with-holden from him.</HI> He knows <HI>the thoughts afar off,</HI> Psal. 139.2. What can be more plain and express than what God says? Ezek. 11.5. <HI>I know the things that come into your Mind, every one of them.</HI> No one single thought can pass thro' our Minds, but God observes it. God knows what belief we entertain in our Minds, about himself, about his glorious perfections, about his holy Truths and Ways; what opinions we have about our selves, about our own state as to the future World, about our own ways and actions; what opinions we have, about other Persons, other things, &amp; the actions of others. He knows all our designs, purposes, con∣trivances
<PB N="30" REF="001491_0030_0FB3500F65B916D8"/>
of what nature soever they are; whether men know any thing of them or not. He knows all the arguings and reasonings we at any time have, about any affair whatsoever. God knows all our doubts, fears objections; all our hopes, desires, wishes whether good or bad. He knows what we <HI>Love</HI> and what we <HI>Hate,</HI> what we <HI>Grieve</HI> for or <HI>Rejoyce</HI> at. In a word, God is most perfectly acquainted with all the secret actions and motions of the Soul. He has a more exact knowledge of every mans heart, than the man himself has. Tis undeniably true, that God exactly knows the heart of every Person. This was the first Proposition: we therefore proceed to the Second.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD><HI>PROP. II.</HI> He will give to him according to his Ways.</HEAD>
<P>GOD has made all Creatures for his own Glory. <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.4. And he will have glory from every one of them, in one way or other.

They should glorify God, by yielding unfeigned Obe∣dience to his Laws; if they don't, He'll glorify himself in Punishing them for their Disobedience. Indeed all men have sinned, they all fell in <HI>Adam;</HI> and so became legally obnoxious, to the Everlasting Wrath and Vengeance of God. But <HI>God</HI> (in the wonders of his Grace) <HI>has so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, this whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting Life,</HI> Joh. 3 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tho' mens sins have been never so many or great, yet if they heartily spent of and turn from them, accepting of Christ on Gospel terms:

they shall then be Pardoned and Saved for Ever. But if they don't heartily comply with this way of Salvation, they must perish unavoidably to all Eternity. Well, God will call all men to an ac∣count, and he will deal with them, according to what their hearts and ways have been. He some∣times (as we hinted before) deals with them in <HI>some measure,</HI> according to their ways even <HI>here in this world:</HI> but 'twill be more fully and com∣pleatly done, hereafter in the Great Day of Judg∣ment. Here therefore we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That every Person shall be brought to Judgment.</HI> We read, Mat. 23.31, 32. That <HI>all Nations</HI> must be gather'd <HI>before Christs Throne.</HI> They must be there <HI>assembled</HI> to be <HI>Tried</HI> Rom. 14.10. <HI>We must all stand before the Judgment-seat of Christ. All!</HI> What must none be excus'd? No, not so much as one. <HI>Small and Great</HI> must appear, and the <HI>Books</HI> (where∣in their thoughts words and deeds were recorded) <HI>must be opened,</HI> Rev. 20.12. Rulers and Ruled, Rich and Poor, High and Low, Young and Old must appear. The <HI>Master</HI> as well as the <HI>Servant,</HI> must then appear; those that were <HI>Judges</HI> on Earth, as well as those that were Judged by them. The mighty Ones of the Earth, Kings and Emperors must appear; and also the Meanest and Lowest in the world. But what, may not some appear by Proxie? Mayn't they get some <HI>Attorney</HI> to repre∣sent them, and manage their cause for them? No Indeed, <HI>every one</HI> must <HI>Personally</HI> appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ. There's no possibility to avoid or escape it. Sometimes in this world, those that should be brought on their Trial, for some Crime they're accus'd of; do yet escape such a trial. It may be they <HI>hide,</HI> and so can't be bro't

forth; or <HI>flee,</HI> they <HI>run away</HI> and can't be seiz'd; or they <HI>Fee</HI> or <HI>Bribe</HI> one or other; and so are <HI>not Tried</HI> as they should be. Such things as these are too common among men, but no such thing can be in the Day of Judgment. The <HI>Angels</HI> shall be the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> (if we may so term them) to bring all to the Bar of Christ; they shall be the <HI>Reapers,</HI> who shall gather both <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Tares</HI> to recieve their respective Doom, <HI>Mat</HI> 13 37 — 43. There's not one Man, Woman or Child in this Congregation, or in this World, but what must personally appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There will be but two sorts of Persons, in the Day of Judgment.</HI> There will be the <HI>Godly</HI> and the <HI>Un∣godly.</HI> The <HI>Godly</HI> are set forth, under the name of <HI>Sheep standing at Christs Right hand;</HI> and the <HI>Un∣godly,</HI> under the name of <HI>Goats standing at his Left hand,</HI> Mat. 25.33. All that shall be raised from the Dead, and all that shall be Judged (for both <HI>Quick</HI> and <HI>Dead</HI> must be Judg'd at Christ's appearing, 2 Tim. 4.1.) are distributed into the <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Unjust,</HI> Act, 24.15. Into those that have <HI>done Good,</HI> and those that have <HI>done Evil,</HI> Joh. 5.28 29.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>All the Good Deeds of the Godly shall be mention'd in the Day of Judgment, and be Eternally Rewarded.</HI> We read, that their <HI>Faith</HI> shall be found to <HI>Praise, Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> in the Day of Christ's appearing, 1 Pet 1.6, 7 Then, their <HI>Secret Prayers</HI> shall be <HI>rewarded Openly,</HI> Mat. 6 6. Their <HI>Alens-deeds</HI> shall then be <HI>rewarded,</HI> Mat 25.34.35. Yea we're told in general, Eph. 6.8. That <HI>whasoever good thing any man doth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</HI> All the Pious Words and Coun∣sels of the Godly; all their Just Righteous and Commendable Deeds; yea all their Holy Serious Thoughts, Designs, Purposes, Desires, shall then
<PB N="33" REF="001491_0033_0FB3501461C45D08"/>
be Openly Published, Eternally and Gloriously Rewarded; a reward of Grace shall then be be∣stowed, for all their exercise of Grace here in this world. Then the Godly shall find by most blessed experience, that they serv'd a good Master; that none of their doings or sufferings for Christ, were lost or in vain. They'll never repent of any thing they did, or suffer'd for Christ. That day of Re∣compence, will be a day of inconceiveable Joy to them. No Tongue can express, how surprizing, how ravishing their Joy and Delight will be, and that for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>All the Sins of the Wicked shall be openly mention'd it the Judgment Day, and be Punish'd for ever.</HI> As that day will bring surprizing Joy and Glory to the Godly; so 'twill bring surprizing Shame, Woe and Misery to the Wicked. Then their sinful <HI>Deeds,</HI> shall be laid open before the world. Now they often strive to <HI>Conceal</HI> their sins from men, and if they can do that, they content themselves. The Apostle says, Eph 5.12. <HI>Tis a shame even to speak of those things, which are done of them in secret.</HI> They do them <HI>in Secret,</HI> because they're <HI>asham'd</HI> to have them known. Job 24, 14, 15. <HI>The Murderer rising with the Light slayeth the Poor and Needy; and in the Night is as a Thief. The eye also of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight; saying no Eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</HI> Thus the wicked seek to hide their Sins from men, but God will make them known hereafter. Doubtless there are many <HI>secret Murders, secret Thefts, secret Fornications</HI> and <HI>A∣dulteries, secret Extortions and methods of Unrighteous Gain;</HI> which the wicked would not have known to their Neighbours by any means. It may be they would not have them known to such a num∣ber of People as are now in this House, <HI>for all the

Well, even <HI>Heart-abominations</HI> shall be called over, and condemned in the Judgment Day.

Then shall the Wicked receive from their Judge, according to all the <HI>Bad</HI> (the Evil) that they have done here in the Body, 2 Cor. 5.10. They shall be cover'd with <HI>Shame and Everlasting Contempt,</HI> Dan. 12.2. They shall receive Wrath and Vengeance, in full weight and measure for all their offences. Then they'll find to their most sorrowful cost, that their neglect∣ing and provoking God, was the highest <HI>Folly</HI> as well as <HI>Rebellion.</HI> Their pleasures <HI>in Sin</HI> were but for a <HI>Season,</HI> their plagues <HI>for Sin</HI> will be <HI>Everlasting.</HI> Their lusts burnt <HI>in them</HI> on Earth. Gods wrath will burn <HI>on them</HI> in hell for ever. Their Sins shall be set in order before their Faces, the view of which, will fill them with unuttera∣ble horror and confusion for ever.

then be awaken'd, and shall roar upon them, and fill them with inconceivable anguish to all Eternity.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>We may now proceed to the USE of these things, in a few Inferences.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We should never allow our selves in any Sin, under the Notion of it's being</HI> SECRET. Indeed, Sins are frequently and properly distinguish'd into <HI>Open</HI> and <HI>Secret;</HI> but this distinction refers only to <HI>Men,</HI> and not at all to <HI>God:</HI> for all things are equally known to him. Therefore Oh Man, never indulge thy self in any Sin, tho' thou canst keep it secret a while from Men; such Secrecy, cannot exempt thee from Punish∣ment at last. If thou darest not do such or such an ill thing, <HI>before Men,</HI> for fear of blame, shame and punishment from them; and yet darest to do the same ill thing <HI>in Secret,</HI> then thou shew∣est more regard to Men than to God. Tis said of some Idolaters, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.25. They worshipped and served the <HI>Creature, more than the Creator.</HI> So thou shewest more regard to Creatures, than to the Creator; if thou canst dare to Sin because 'tis <HI>in Secret.</HI> Thou shewest more regard to Mans presence, than to Gods presence; to Mans eye than to Gods eye. Canst thou dare to <HI>Steal,</HI> because men don't see thee? But consider Oh man, the Great GOD, the Holy JEHOVAH stands by and looks on. Canst thou commit <HI>Fornication</HI> or <HI>Adultery,</HI> because there are no hu∣mane Witnesses by? But consider, the great GOD sees thy filthiness, as plainly as he saw
<PB N="37" REF="001491_0037_0FB3501DA71E82D8"/>
<HI>Absoloms</HI> on the <HI>House top,</HI> before all Israel and before the Sun. Canst thou dare to extort, cheat, defraud, because thou reckonest thou canst hide it from men? But alas, notwithstanding all thy Whiffling shuffling tricks, notwithstanding all the baffling plea's thou dost use with thy Sleepy Con∣science; yet God observes very critically, all thy methods of Unrighteous gain; and he stamps a curse on thee for them. 1 Thes. 4.6. <HI>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter</HI> (not in any matter whatsoever) <HI>because the Lord is the avenger of all such.</HI> Canst thou dare among some of thine Intimates, to belye, revile, re∣proach others, to blast their reputation, to raise or spread ill reports of them; canst thou dare to do this, thinking 'twont be known that it comes from thee, or that it can't be prov'd upon thee? Alas, the great GOD hears, and critically observes all this thy wickedness. So far as thou dost Indulge any Sin, under the Notion of it's being <HI>Secret;</HI> so far thou dost practically deny God to be <HI>Omnipresent,</HI> and <HI>Omniscient.</HI> For thou seemest to suppose, that there is no God, or that he is not an Allseeing and Holy Judge. Oh let not such cursed Atheism prevail in thy Soul. Thou shouldest avoid Sin chiefly for this reason, to wit, that it displeaseth and provoketh God; therefore thou shouldst avoid <HI>Secret</HI> as well as <HI>Open</HI> Sins, for the former as well as the latter are known to him, and provoke him. The Allseeing eye of thy glori∣ous Judge is always upon thee, by Day and by Night, whether alone or in company; let the thought; of this, keep thee from allowing thy self in any known Sin whatsoever. When <HI>Jo∣seph</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="001491_0038_0FB3501F2B46E350"/>
was tempted to Sin <HI>in Secret,</HI> he reply'd, Gen. 39 9. <HI>How shall I do this great wickedness, and Sin against God!</HI> He dare not do it, tho' in <HI>Secret</HI> as to <HI>Men,</HI> for he consider'd that <HI>God would see and be provok'd with it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We should Repent even of our Secret Sins.</HI> Tis not enough, that we repent of our Sinful Words and Actions, which are commonly known to those about us: but we should heartily Re∣pent of our <HI>Secret</HI> Sins too, for our glorious Judge knows them all. Oh Man, Woman, it may be thou hast been guilty of secret Mur∣der, secret Fornication or Adultery, secret Lyes or Perjuries, secret Reproaches and Defamations, secret Thiefts, Cheats, Frauds and Cursed me∣thods of unrighteous gain; Well, God thy glorious Judge knows all these things What if men don't know them, yet thy Judge does, and he needs no Witnesses. What if thou shouldst go on Secretly in thy Wickedness, and go Impenitent and Undiscover'd to the Grave? What then? why all thy secret Villanies, shall hereafter be publish'd before the World, and be Publish'd for ever. Therefore speedily Repent of Secret (as well as open) wickedness. Awa∣ken thy sleepy Conscience, let it do it's office, let it speak plainly and faithfully; hearken to it's reproofs, don't stiffle them; for it will roar dreadfully hereafter, and that to thine eternal confusion too, if speedy hearty Repentance pre∣vent not. Oh be serious and in good earnest, examine thine heart, thy past actions <HI>Secret</HI> as well as others; unfeignedly Repent of, Mourn for, and Turn from even all thy <HI>Secret</HI> as well
<PB N="39" REF="001491_0039_0FB35020A387CB70"/>
as open Sins. And if thou hast <HI>Secretly</HI> wrong'd others, in their <HI>Name</HI> or <HI>Estates,</HI> do thine ut∣most to make Reparation. Don't keep what thou hast gotten in any unjust way, tho' never so secretly; thou wilt keep the Curse and Wrath of God on thy Soul, if thou dost. Oh take warning before 'tis too late, speedily and hearti∣ly Repent▪ fly to the blood of JESUS for Par∣don, and forsake thy evil ways. GOD is now calling on thee and warning of thee to Repent; if thou dost not now take warning, it may be few or no more warnings may be given thee: or if they be, possibly God may Judicially give thee up to a seared Conscience; and may say, Let him that is filthy be filthy still, let him that is unjust be unjust still▪ What if God should say, if such an one, or such an one does not take warning, repent and reform now; then he shall go on in his secret ways of wickedness, and shall be blinded and hardened in Sin, till he drops into the unquenchible flames of the pit below; if God should say thus, how dreadful would it be! For the Lords Sake, and for our Souls Sake▪ let us consider these things and impress them on our Con∣sciences.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Here's matter of Support and Comfort to the Godly, under false Charges and Accusations laid a∣gainst them.</HI> The world is commonly fill'd with groundless Rumors and false Reports; and the Godly often suffer much by them. The A∣postle said, Rom. 3.8 <HI>We be slandorously Reported. David</HI> said, Psal. 35.11. <HI>False Witnesses did rise up, they laid to my Charge things that I knew not.</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="001491_0040_0FB35022AB674C30"/>
Well, the consideration of the All-seeing Eye of our Glorious Judge, should quiet and support us if at any time vile false Reports are raised of us. If any Charge us with saying such or such ill things, which we never said; or with doing such or such ill things which we never did; or with having some ill design which we never had; if it be so, this may Support us, That GOD who knows all things and will Judge us at last, knows that we are Innocent in these matters. If our Consciences Testify for us in such Cases, they are better (as to our own in∣ward Peace and Satisfaction) than a Thousand Witnesses. Indeed, if men raise false Reports of us, and our Name suffer thereby; we should seriously Consider God's Hand in such Affliction, (<HI>David</HI> Ey'd the Hand of God in <HI>Shimei</HI>'s Cur∣sing) inquire into the Voice and Meaning of such a Providence, and Indeavour to comply therewith by growing more Humble and Holy. Yet so far as we are Innocent, the thoughts of our Innocency being known to God, should greatly Quiet and Comfort us.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>We should be Incouraged to Secret Duties.</HI> As the Consideration, of the All-seeing Eye of our Glorious Judge, should keep us from <HI>Se∣cret</HI> as well as <HI>Open Sins;</HI> so it should quicken us to <HI>Secret</HI> as well as <HI>Open Duties.</HI> We should be Religious in our <HI>Cases,</HI> as well as in the place of God's <HI>Publick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Remember what <HI>Motive</HI> our Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to Quicken unto <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> Mat. 6 6. <HI>Enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast short thy Door, Pray to thy Father which seeth in Secret; and thy Father which</HI> SEETH IN SE∣CRET
<PB N="41" REF="001491_0041_0FB35023A0067C80"/>
<HI>shall</HI> REWARD THEE OPENLY. God Sees and will Reward, Secret as well as Open Duties; therefore we should be Incourag'd to them We should be Quicken'd to do what's Good and Laudable, tho' men don't see us, tho' there's little or no notice taken of it by others; for God sees every Sincere Duty, is Pleas'd with it and will Reward it. If men give Alms out of Obedience to God, tho' so Secretly that their right hand scarce knows what their left hand does; yet he that sees in Secret will reward it Openly. Such Alms shall come up for a Memorial before God. He that is Se∣cretly and Sincerely (as well as Externally) Pious, shall be Openly and Eternally Glorious.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>We should use utmost Diligence to be Sincere and Hearty, in all our External Religious (or other Commendable) Performances</HI> God not only hears all our Words and sees our Outward Actions, but He also observes the Inward Principles from whence they flow; even all the secret Designs of the heart in them. Many things have a fair Outside to men's Eye, but a black In-side to God's Eye. The <HI>Pharisees</HI> did <HI>Outwardly ap∣pear Righteous to Men</HI> but <HI>Inwardly were full of Iniquity and Hypocrisy:</HI> All the good things they did, they did them <HI>to be seen of Men,</HI> Mat. 23.5, 38. Men often serve the Devil and their own Lusts, under a <HI>Mask of Religion,</HI> under a plausible show and pretence of Holiness. <HI>Absolom</HI> asks leave to go to <HI>Hebron,</HI> under a pretence of <HI>pay∣ing his Vows to God;</HI> when <HI>Treason was in his Heart;</HI> his design was to raise a Rebellion against his Royal Father. <HI>Jezebel</HI> orders a <HI>Fast,</HI> pre∣tends
<PB N="42" REF="001491_0042_0FB3502523797778"/>
to have <HI>Justice done,</HI> and a <HI>Reformation wrought;</HI> when the design was, to <HI>Murder Na∣both</HI> and get his <HI>Vineyard. Herod</HI> Inquires after the holy Child Jesus, pretending to <HI>Worship</HI> him, but intending to <HI>Murder</HI> him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 2. <HI>ch</HI> Alas, the <HI>Devil</HI> transforms himself into an <HI>Angel of Light,</HI> and his Children often Imitate him in such hellish dissimulation. They often pretend much zeal for God, when indeed their hearts are Set on their wickedness. Well, let us never allow our selves in such hypocritical practices, for GOD our Judge <HI>Sees our Hearts;</HI> tho' 'tis possible to deceive Men 'tis impossible to deceive God. Let our main care therefore be, to approve our hearts to God in all we do. We all call our selves Christians, we profess and pretend to be the Disciples of Christ; but if we are not hearty and sincere in it, God will damn us for our Unbelief and Hypocrisy. If we have not the <HI>Power</HI> as well as the <HI>Form,</HI> of <HI>Godliness;</HI> if we have not <HI>Oyl in our Vessels</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Grace in our Souls) as well as in our <HI>Lamps</HI> (<HI>i. e</HI> our out∣ward Profession) then we shall perish for ever. Therefore On Man, be a Christian indeed and in truth, unfeignedly receive Christ on Gospel-termes, and live to him as Prince and Saviour. Outward shews without inward Sincerity, will avail thee nothing in a dying-hour What tho' thou dost profess the self <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christian, what if thou art a Church Member, and dost lead a blameless Life in the view of Men, and all thy Neighbours count thee an eminent Saint; yet if thy heart be unsound and hypocritical, God will cast thee into Hell for ever. Ih never con∣tent nor satisfie thy self, meerly in approving
<PB N="43" REF="001491_0043_0FB35027C056F1D0"/>
thy self to Men, and getting their good Opi∣nion of thee; but approve thy heart to God in all things. Don't content thy self in doing those things that are Materially good, but see that thine heart be right with God, in the doing of them. When thou hearest a Sermon, let thy heart be Ingag'd with God in that Duty. When thou makest a Prayer, let thine Heart as well as thy Mouth draw nigh to God. Oh Christian, take heed that thou dost not deceive thy self, even in doing that which is Materially good and com∣mendable. Be vigorous to promote every thing that's Holy Just and Good; yet don't be Hypo∣critical in it, don't do it to be seen of men: but do it out of hearty Obedience to God, aiming at his Glory therein, for he sees thy heart whatever thy pretences are. Be zealous against Sin in others, duely to witness against and suppress it; this is thy Duty, don't neglect it. Yet don't allow the same Sins, nor any others in thy self. And again take heed, that thou art not carryed forth by a Spirit of prejudice or re∣venge; for if 'tis personal prejudice or revenge, that makes thee condemn the faults of others, then thou dost serve the Devil and thine own lusts in doing it: thou dost make the lusts of others, fuel for thine own lusts to feed on. Take heed therefore that thy heart be right with God, even in doing those things which are Materially good and laudable; for God sees the heart, and hares Hypocrisy. He <HI>hates Robbery for burnt offerings,</HI> Isa 61 8 He hates that Men under a pretence of honouring him, should serve the Devil and their own corruptions. Therefore do the things that God commands, but do them with an <HI>Upright Heart,</HI> and with <HI>Sincere Designs.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="44" REF="001491_0044_0FB35028DF07B1F0"/>VI. <HI>We should not allow our selves in any thing, but what we can give a good account of in the Day of Judgment.</HI> Surely this should be our greatest Stu∣dy and Care, since our Text tells us, That God will <HI>Give to every one according to his ways.</HI> It may be when we are to manage such or such an affair, we think and consider what to do in it; and we inquire in our own Minds, what will such and such Persons, it may be great Men, or it may be some intimate Friends or near Relations; what will they think or say of it, how will they like it? I say, it may be we are apt to reason thus with our selves, about what we are going to do (and indeed it may not be improper, in many cases and cir∣cumstances thus to query) but our great inquiry should be. <HI>How will God like of it?</HI> What will our glorious Judge think of it? Will it please him? Then let us do it tho' it displease all men. Will it displease God? Then let us shun it tho' Men are never so much provok'd thereby. Let us act or not act, as shall be most for our Peaceable and Comfortable account, in the great Day of Judg∣ment. According as we behave our selves now, so shall we be dealt with here-after. For we are told <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.28, 29. (with which I shall conclude) <HI>All that are in they Graves shall hear his</HI> (that is, Christ's) <HI>Voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good to the Resurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil to the Resurrection of Damnation.</HI></P>
