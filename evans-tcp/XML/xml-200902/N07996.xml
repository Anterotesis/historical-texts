<HEAD>A Continuation of the NARRA∣TIVE, &amp;c. of the <HI>Indian</HI> Charity-School in <HI>Lebanon.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> NARRATIVE of this School was published in the Year 1763. In which may be seen the original Design, Rise, and Progress of it from its Beginning to <HI>Nov.</HI> 27th, 1762; together with the Grounds and Reasons for prosecuting the Plan which has hitherto been pursued; and which, by the Smiles of Heaven, has been remarkably succeeded. The following Pages are designed to exhibit to the Reader, the State of said School from the a∣bove Date to <HI>September</HI> 3d, 1765; by which may appear to the impartial and candid Rea∣der, the singular Smiles of Divine Providence, by which it has been hitherto supported, and the encouraging Prospects of it's future and extensive Usefulness.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010207_0003_0F7D90EE81EB4988"/><HI>August</HI> 1st, 1762, Mr. <HI>James Lesley</HI> began to teach this School. And by the generous Donation of his painful Labours for almost 9 Months; and of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Charles Jeffry Smith</HI> for about 3 Months; and about 6 Weeks of another young Gentleman, (who chuses to be nameless;) it was kept in the best Manner from the above mentioned Date 'til <HI>September</HI> 17th, 1763, free from any other Cost for Tuition, than the Masters Board, and a few Months Horse-keeping. And the whole of my Disbursements from <HI>November</HI> 27th, 1762, to <HI>November</HI> 27th, 1763, (including part of Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI>'s Support at College; and the fitting out and Support of <HI>Samuel Ashpo</HI> in his short Mission of about six Weeks to <HI>Jenin∣go,</HI> from whence he was obliged to retreat, on account of the Rupture of the Nations round about, with the <HI>English,</HI> after preaching to them 10 Days) I say, the whole Amount, charged at the Rates I mentioned in my for∣mer Narrative, is, in sterling Money,

<P><HI>March</HI> 12th, 1765, the Board of Correspondents met to exa∣mine Mr. <HI>Titus Smith</HI> and Mr. <HI>Theophilus Chamberlain,</HI> of their Qualifications for Missionaries; and approved them. And also examined and approved <HI>David Fowler,</HI> a <HI>Montauk</HI> Indian, and <HI>Joseph Woolley</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah Calvin, Delawares,</HI> for Schoolma∣sters among the Indians. They also examined <HI>Jacob Fowler,</HI> a <HI>Montauk, Moses, Johannes, Abraham Primus, Abraham Secun∣dus,</HI> and <HI>Peter, Mohawks;</HI> and approved them as well accom∣plished for Schoolmasters, excepting their Want of Age; and therefore appointed them to serve in the Capacity of Ushers, un∣der the Direction and Conduct of the Missionaries.</P>
<P>The Missionaries were ordained <HI>April</HI> 24th—at which Time we had not one Penny in Stock to support the great Charge of ex∣ecuting the Plan we had lain, as may appear by the Account con∣nected herewith: nor any where to look or depend for the same, but upon him who disposes the Hearts of Men as he pleases, to accomplish his own Designs. The Missionaries and Schoolmasters were cloathed, and furnished with four Horses, Furniture, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. with all convenient Speed; and had no Occasion to wait one Day to be furnished with a present Supply of Money for the Support of their several Missions; and all sat out, viz. <HI>David Fowler</HI> on the 29th of <HI>April</HI>—Messieurs <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Chamberlain</HI> on the 19th of <HI>June</HI>—and, on the 25th of the same, the Rest of the Schoolmasters followed them (excepting <HI>Jacob Fowler</HI> who was detained with a View, if God should open a Door for it, to accompany an English Youth to a yet more remote Tribe, to learn their Language, and fit for a Mission among them) and carried with them some present Supply for Mr. <HI>Kirtland.</HI></P>
<P>This Board of Correspendents in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> commissioned for Indian Affairs by the honorable Society in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> for propagating Christian Knowledge, was formed <HI>July</HI> 4th, 1764.</P>

<P><PB N="12" REF="010207_0011_0F7D90F612315D28"/>About £.26.—lawful Money of the Dona∣tions mentioned in the foregoing Account, has not yet come into my Hands, though it he well secured; which, with what has been taken up upon my Credit, and not bro't into the foregoing Account, because the Sums cannot yet be precisely known, being at a great Distance, do more than equal the Bal∣lance mentioned in Page 10, as due from me to the School: so that there is at present no∣thing in Stock, more than the small Supply for a few Month's which the Missionaries have with them, to support all the Expence of three Missionaries, one Interpreter, and eight School-Masters, in the Wilderness, at the Distance of three, four, and five hundred Miles from hence; besides what must be done for the Assistance of Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> who has a Wife and 7 Children.</P>
<P>The Missionaries and School-Masters being authorized by the Board of Correspondents, sat out as before-mentioned; Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> for <HI>Onohokwage,</HI> agreeable to the Desire of the In∣dians there, which they sent in Writing to this Board <HI>March</HI> 12th, by good <HI>Peter</HI> (other∣wise called <HI>Gwedelhes Agwirondongwas</HI>) their Messenger. This Place is on <HI>Susquehanna-Ri∣ver,</HI> where several Missionaries have hereto∣fore been; and especially the Rev. Mr. <HI>Haw∣ley,</HI> who laboured among them for several Years, with good Evidences of the saving Ef∣fects of his Labours, in several Instances.—
<PB N="13" REF="010207_0012_0F7D90F6B5FD80B0"/>
To this Party the Rev. Mr. <HI>Forbes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rice</HI> were sent by the Honorable correspon∣ding <HI>Scotch</HI> Commissioners in <HI>Boston,</HI> and ga∣thered a Church consisting of 12 or 14 Mem∣bers in 1762. But the last Spring the Famine prevailed in that Place before Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> could get there, so that the Indians were obliged to remove and disperse, in order to get a living, 'til their Corn should be fit to eat. And ac∣cordingly, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Gunn</HI> his In∣terpreter, went to the largest Party of them, who were for the present set down by the Lake <HI>Utsage,</HI> at the Head of <HI>Susquehanna-Ri∣ver;</HI> where he put <HI>Moses,</HI> one of the afore∣mentioned <HI>Mohawk</HI> Boys, into a small School, instead of <HI>Joseph Woolley</HI> who was appointed School-master to that Tribe, but was then sick at <HI>Cherry-Valley.</HI> The Account of this School I give in the Words of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Letter, da∣ted at said Lake, <HI>August</HI> 3d 1765.— <Q>I am every Day diverted and pleased with a View of <HI>Moses</HI> and his School; as I can sit in my Study, and see him and all his Scholars at any Time, the School-House being no∣thing but an open Barrack. And I am much pleased to see 8, 10, or 12, and some∣times more Scholars sitting round their Bark Table, some Reading, some Writing, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have found it useful to put them to Writing as soon as they can spell.</NOTE> and others a Studying; and all engaged, to ap∣pearance, with as much Seriousness and At∣tention
<PB N="14" REF="010207_0013_0F7D90F992D08F10"/>
as you will see in almost any wor∣shipping Assembly: and <HI>Moses</HI> at the Head of them with the Gravity of a Divine of Fif∣ty or Threescore. How agreeable such a Sight would be to you, is not hard to guess! I expect this School will be much larger when it comes to <HI>Onohokwage,</HI> as there are but a few here, and many of those that are, upon the Account of the present Scarcity, are obliged to employ their Children. The School at <HI>Onohokwage</HI> will doubtless be large enough for <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> both.—</Q></P>
<P><HI>Joseph Woolley</HI> lived with this Party of In∣dians at <HI>Onohokwage</HI> last Winter, in order to teach their Children, and learn their Lan∣guage. But there were not many of them in∣clined to send their Children to learn English. The Chief Sachem said, they might learn enough in Indian; which Notion, I suppose, he and that Party imbibed from some white People who had been there. But after <HI>Peter</HI>'s return to them from hence in the Spring, they seemed unanimously inclined to have an Eng∣lish School set up; and are much engaged to introduce Agriculture among them, and have lately petitioned earnestly to be assisted there∣in by the <HI>English,</HI> and desire to have Mills built, and a Blacksmith settled with them, and so many of the <HI>English</HI> to settle among them, as shall be necessary to instruct them in these Affairs. They promise they will observe and obey to their utmost, all the Advice and In∣struction sent them by <HI>Peter</HI> last Spring.—
<PB N="15" REF="010207_0014_0F7D90F9F9F33098"/>
They have promised to build a House for <HI>Jo∣seph Woolley,</HI> and help him fence some Lands for Tillage, and for keeping Cows, &amp;c. and to do all on their Part, and within their Power, to enable him to govern and teach their Chil∣dren. And I hope soon to hear, that he and <HI>Moses</HI> are settled in a large School at that Place. This is a remarkable Alteration in their Dis∣position. The like also, <HI>David Fowler</HI> informs me, appears in the Indians at <HI>Oneida,</HI> about a hundred Miles distant from thence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> after he had settled several Indian Boys in Schools in several Indian Towns in the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country; viz. <HI>Hezekiah Calvin</HI> in a School of 24 Scholars, <HI>Abraham Primus</HI> in one of 16, and <HI>Abraham Secundus</HI> in one of 11; was about to go with the <HI>Oneidaes,</HI> on their return to their Country, which they also had been obliged to leave, on account of the Famine there. At that Place he purposed to spend the most of his Time this Year; and takes <HI>Johannes</HI> with him for his Interpreter, who has hitherto served him in that Capacity; and at proper Seasons to visit the Schools which he has erected.</P>
<P><HI>David Fowler</HI> met with a kind Reception among the Indians at <HI>Oneida;</HI> and set up a School among them in <HI>May,</HI> consisting of 26 Scholars, and continued in it some Weeks. He also taught a singing School, in which the Indians made great Proficiency, and had lear∣ned well to carry three Parts to several Tunes.
<PB N="16" REF="010207_0015_0F7D90FA9A798EB0"/>
They promised to build him a House, and be∣gan to prepare Materials, (i.e. HemlockBark) to build it. They also promised him a free Use and Improvement of their Lands, and to assist him in clearing and fencing them; and were many ways exerting themselves to set up Husbandry, and desired him to instruct them therein. But by reason of the Famine which prevailed among them, they were o∣bliged to remove with their Children 'til their Corn should be fit to eat; and desired <HI>David</HI> to come down to <HI>New-England,</HI> and procure a Carpenter, who might be able to build them Houses, make Ploughs, Carriages, &amp;c. for them; and desired he would return to them when they should be able to subsist in their Country; which he has also done. They also promised to send their Children to School, and suitably encourage him in governing them, &amp;c. He yet finds difficulty in commu∣nicating to them the Things of Religion, not being sufficiently Master of their Language, and having no skilful Interpreter with him. But he hopes this will be soon remedied by his becoming compleat Master of their Tongue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kirtland,</HI> who went among that savage and brutish Tribe, the <HI>Senecas,</HI> last Fall, soon after the Peace was settled with them, to learn, their Language, and fit himself, and prepare the Way for a Mission among them, was o∣bliged, on account of the Famine which pre∣vailed
<PB N="17" REF="010207_0016_0F7D90FB52123880"/>
in that Country, to come to <HI>Mohawk</HI>-River, two Hundred Miles, last <HI>June,</HI> for Sup∣plies; and brought with him 13 <HI>Seneca</HI> Boys, to assist him in carrying his Provisions to that Country. Soon after they came down, 12 of the Boys were taken sick with a Dysentery, and four of them died. The rest recovered, and are returned with Mr. <HI>Kirtland.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> has surprisingly insinuated himself into their Affection and Esteem. Their Jealousies of him, which at first were very strong, are now removed. They are fond of his continuing with them; and he hoped, soon on his return to them, to be able to set up a large School among them. And as soon as he is become sufficiently Master of their Lan∣guage, they expect to hear great Things from him. And if God shall mercifully preserve this Youth to accomplish the Plan laid for him, on which there has evidently been the Smiles of Heaven hitherto, it will perhaps be esteemed, when it shall be fully known in all the Circumstances of it, to have been as ex∣traordinary an Undertaking of this kind, as has ever been in this Land.</P>
<P>His Excellency Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON, (whose Understanding and Influence in Indian Affairs, is, I suppose, greater than any other Man's, and for whose indefatigable and suc∣cessful Labours to settle and secure a Peace with the several Tribes who have lately been at War with us, our Land and Nation are,
<PB N="18" REF="010207_0017_0F7D90FC005EA678"/>
under God, chiefly indebted) has not been wanting in his Care and Endeavors for Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI>'s Safety and Usefulness among them.</P>
<P>But these Affairs are many of them yet so new, and my Distance from the Missionaries so great, and no Post to keep up a Correspon∣dence with them, that my Accounts at pre∣sent must needs be very imperfect: Nor am I yet able any further to ascertain the Number of Indian Children now at the several Schools in the Wilderness. However, all Accounts I have yet received, agree, that there is an un∣usual Desire of Knowledge among those who have got a little Understanding of Christianity; and a great Willingness, and, in many In∣stances, a Desire to have their Children taught. —Their Jealousies of the English, seem more than ever to be removed.— Missionaries and School-masters are received and treated with more Respect and Kindness than usual.—And among some Parties, such a Desire and En∣gagedness to introduce Agriculture, and de∣pend upon that, instead of rambling and hunting, for a Living, as has never been be∣fore known: and a Motive hereto with many of them seems to be, that they and their Chil∣dren may be in a better Capacity to receive Instruction, than is possible while they are on their fishing and hunting Marches hundreds of Miles together.</P>
<P>And by the Way I would observe, that if only here and there a Tribe were civilized,
<PB N="19" REF="010207_0018_0F7D90FCC3EBB538"/>
christianized, and Husbandry introduced a∣mong them, what agreeable Places of Retreat might these be for our Missionaries! And what a Saving of the great Expence for their Support, which cannot be avoided, so long as their Provisions are to be transported such a great Distance! Besides the many useful In∣telligences they will have from a <HI>Priscilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila</HI> there, and many comforting and ani∣mating Considerations suggested to encourage and strengthen them in the Work of the Lord! And I would humbly propose to Considerati∣on, whether the Advantages we may expect hereby, will not be worth all the Cost and Pains that will be necessary to assist the poor Creatures to set up Husbandry, and give them all necessary Instruction in the Practice of it? I conceive the necessary Expence for this will not be vastly great. And when it is once introduced into a few Places, they will soon be able to assist their Brethren, and so carry the Practice still further into other Tribes. I doubt not, the Thoughts of Gentlemen of Penetration, will at once suggest many and very great Advantages that may accrue to the general Design hereby.</P>
<P>And as Divine Providence has always from the first prevented me with seasonable Supplies, before the Case came to extremity, or to be at all distressing, however threatning the Ap∣pearances have often been; so I would hope in the same Fountain of Goodness to supply
<PB N="20" REF="010207_0019_0F7D90FD746BE818"/>
these growing Necessities. And this I think we may do with the more Confidence, as we have endeavoured to go no faster in the Af∣fair, than to observe the Openings, and follow the plainest Dictates of Providence in every Step that has been taken. And hitherto scarce a Step has been taken, but God has evidently made it to prosper. If the Cause be God's, and the Course we steer right, it is safe enough.</P>
<P>But I would humbly propose to Considera∣tion, whether as swift a Progress of this Work as may be, is not likely to be attended with greater Success proportionable to the Expence, than a more leisurely Procedure? which will not have that Tendency to awaken their At∣tention, convince their Consciences, and pro∣voke them to Emulation; and which will give the Adversaries to it much more Oppor∣tunity to embarrass the Way.</P>
<P>It seems to me, that the peculiar Circum∣stance of the Newness of the Thing, and Re∣solution of God's People to accomplish it, and to do it by such Means and Endeavours, as must necessarily appear great and strange to the Savages, is, in itself, likely to have great Force and Influence to make them hear atten∣tively, and consider closely, the Nature, Im∣portance, and Evidence of the Things spoken to them; and to convince them effectually of the Sincerity of our Intentions towards them, while they see our Practice to be so agreeable to the vast Importance of the Errand on which
<PB N="21" REF="010207_0020_0F7D9100612E2BD0"/>
we come to them. And while our Endea∣vours are used, as they now are, so much by their own Sons, we have a great additional Advantage to avoid the mischievous Effects of those Jealousies and Suspicions which they have so long entertained, that, notwithstand∣ing all our Pretentions, there is a secret Plot laid to get away their Lands, and make a Prey of them.</P>
<P>The Number of Charity-Scholars now be∣longing to this School, is eighteen; besides the five <HI>Mohawk</HI> Boys before-mentioned, as employed in the Indian Country, who are expected to return to the School next Winter. Eleven of these are Males, [5 English and 6 Indians] and seven Indian Females. Two of these English and two Indian Boys, are de∣signed to be coupled, an English and an In∣dian, and to be sent into some remote Tribes next Spring, if Providence shall favour it, to learn their Languages, and prepare for a Mis∣sion among them.</P>
<P>I am daily expecting two more <HI>Delaware</HI> Boys, and one from <HI>Narraganset;</HI> and before Winter, if they may be well chosen, a Num∣ber from the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> among which is the Grandson to the <HI>Onondaga</HI> Sachem. And I have the Pleasure of thinking, that the Boys I have, are in general, very promising.</P>
<P>It was generally thought, before I had a∣ny Boys from the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country, that nei∣ther the Parents could be persuaded to send,
<PB N="22" REF="010207_0021_0F7D9100D0614878"/>
nor their Children to come to School, at such a great Distance. And the first three who came, appeared to come with great Caution and Fear—brought each of them an Horse with them, prepared to return in haste, if there should be occasion. But so great is the Alteration in this Respect, that the Difficulty now is not in procuring what Number I please; but in obtaining such as are promising, and such as are, on account of their Families, of greatest Importance to their Tribes.</P>
<P>I would take this Opportunity to renew my Thanks to the kind Benefactors of this School, for those generous Benefactions, by which it has, through the Divine Blessing, continued to this Time. And desire the Continuance of their fervent Supplications at the Throne of Divine Grace, for all that Light, Direction, and Assistance, which shall be necessary, for all those who are any way actively concerned in promoting the important Design; and for that Blessing of God upon all Endeavours, without which the best Plans, and most vigo∣rous Efforts to put them in Execution, will be to no Purpose. And I perswade myself, that the growing Prospects of Success, will be a further and very strong Inducement to that Liberality, which will bear Proportion to the great Expences necessary therein. And espe∣cially if it be considered, that these young Gentlemen who are employed in this Business,
<PB N="23" REF="010207_0022_0F7D910168CD7AF8"/>
and are exposed to all the Hardships and Dan∣gers of the Wilderness, without any comfort∣able Habitation, or any Accommodations to indulge the Pleasures of the natural or social Life, have entered upon this Service, not through any Necessity, or want of any lucra∣tive and honorable Posts they might desire a∣mong their Brethren; but only to serve the great Designs of advancing the Kingdom of the Redeemer, and the Salvation of the Souls of Men. And they ask for, and desire no o∣ther Reward for all their Service, but to be supported while they are employed in it. And I am perswaded, that the Accounts them∣selves of their Expences, when Time shall give an Opportunity to set them in a true Light, will be sufficient Evidence of their Prudence and Frugality.</P>

<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> returned from his Mission among the Six Nations, last Friday, (accompa∣nied by two <HI>Oneyada</HI> Boys, for this School) to procure another Missionary for one of the Places where he has been preaching among the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Oneyadas;</HI> and to get Recruits and Supplies of Necessaries for the Winter, for himself and the Schoolmasters, who design to winter with the Indians.</P>
<P>He informs me, that the Indian Schoolmasters have, in general, conducted very well: are received chear∣fully, and treated kindly; and that there are now in their several Schools, 127 Children; and that he had provided another School of upwards of 20 Children more, for <HI>Peter;</HI> but he was taken sick, and could not enter into it—which is ready for him, or another, next Spring.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> also informs me, that he has lately made a Tour among the <HI>Onondagas</HI> (accompanied with Delegates from the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Oneyadas</HI>) and prea∣ched to them, where never any Missionary had been be∣fore. That the Representative of that whole Tribe, told him, after a Consultation of two Days among themselves, that they were all agreed to receive Chris∣tianity, and would have him be easy in his Mind, and know, that from that Day they should be glad to be instructed; and desired him to tarry and preach to them. And when he left them he told them he would do his Endeavour that a Minister should be sent to them next Spring.</P>
