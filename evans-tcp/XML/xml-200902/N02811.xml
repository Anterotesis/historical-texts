<BIBL>PSALM XXVII. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>WHEN my Father and my Mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Title of this Psalm informs us who was the inspired Penman, <HI>King David:</HI> In it he encourageth him∣self in the LORD under his ex∣treme dangers from his Enemies, and especially from <HI>Saul. v.</HI> 1. <HI>The Lord is my light,</HI> the author of my joy, <HI>and my salvation, whom shall I fear</HI> —: And also offers to GOD his earnest requests for help and succour, as in the verse before my Text. <HI>Hide not thy face far from me — leave me not</HI> —. And these words may be brought in as an argu∣ment to enforce his Petition from the conside∣ration of his present state, That of an <HI>Orphan,</HI> who stood in great need of help; or for the en∣couragement of his faith, to trust in that GOD with whom the Fatherless find Mercy.</P>
<P>In the words we have, 1. <HI>A sorrowful case supposed, When my Father —. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> reads it, Because my Father — so it is an argument to enforce his Petition, that GOD would not leave him, nor forsake him. <HI>Piscator</HI>

and <HI>Mollerus</HI> read it, Altho'—. Our reading is, When: and thus <HI>Calvin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We have <HI>his relief under this sorrow,</HI> Then the <HI>LORD will take me up:</HI> Receive, or gather me. Now we don't read that <HI>David</HI>'s Parents did ever desert him, tho' we find them so unable to help him, and so unfit to attend his Marches, that <HI>David</HI> desires of the King of <HI>Moab,</HI> that they might be with him till he should know what GOD would do for him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.3. Accordingly, some Expositors take the words as signifying all humane helps under the Name of Parents, <Q>by which we may understand all Councils and Helps for safety.</Q> Or, as others suppose, <HI>His Parents had depar∣ted this life;</HI> in which sense I wou'd now con∣sider the words. However it was, <HI>David</HI> was now like an <HI>Orphan,</HI> in an helpless condition as to humane views and means, and accordingly he by faith realizeth GOD's Parental care and love, who, as He is ever able to help His Peo∣ple, so hath the bowels of a Father yerning to∣wards them under their distresses; yea, more than the compassions of the tender Mother. <HI>Then the LORD,</HI> the Name given to GOD here is <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> which signifies GOD's Eternal Self-existence, and His giving Being to all Creatures. The fathers of our flesh are Mortal, and must in a little time forsake us, if we are not taken from them first; but GOD the Everlasting Father lives for ever to take care of His People. <HI>Shall take me up,</HI> or ga∣ther me. When Parents are remov'd, the Fa∣mily is ordinarily scattered &amp; broken up; but

<HEAD><HI>Prop. I.</HI> Our best Friends on Earth, our Fa∣thers and our Mothers must forsake us.</HEAD>
<P>GOD alone can say to us and fulfil that His word, <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Our choicest friends here are, as we, frail, mortal Creatures. For what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. <HI>Your Fathers where are they?</HI> — Zech. 1.5. They are no more in this World; they are gone to their long home, to the house appointed for all living; and the Places which once knew them shall know them no more. Accordingly, when the godly depart this life, they are said to be gather∣ed to their People. Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> died in a good old Age, and <HI>was gathered to his Peo∣ple,</HI> Gen. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.8. <Q>When the Saints die out of this World, they are born into the other.</Q> Their bodies indeed are left behind; however, the condition of these is such when the Spirits that animated them are gone, that we must
<PB N="4" REF="003351_0006_0FF8176BA142ADD0"/>
bury them out of sight. And as their bodies rest in their Graves, so their Spirits return to GOD who gave them. When they leave our Society on Earth they go to the heavenly Je∣rusalem, to the Spirits of just Men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant. Here a little to confirm &amp; illustrate this Head, I may say, 1. All Men are subject to the law of Mortality, and must be remov'd out of this World by Death. 2. According to the course of Nature Parents forsake their Children, and leave them behind in this World, when they depart out of it by Death.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All Men are subject to the law of Mor∣tality, and must be remov'd out of this World by Death.</HI> There is a Statute of Heaven for it, Heb. 9.27. — <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to die</HI> —. Indeed the LORD of Life hath made, and will make exceptions to this general rule. Thus <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> under the old Testament, were translated, that they should not see death. (And surely it was a great favour of GOD to the departed Spirits of the Saints, so early to give them an Example of the glo∣rious beauty and perfection which their bodies should be advanced to at the Resurrection <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Enoch</HI> was translated, A. M. 987. <HI>B. Usuer.</HI></NOTE>.) And the <HI>Apostle</HI> informs us that the People of GOD, who shall be found alive at our Saviour's coming to raise the dead, <HI>Shall not sleep,</HI> (i.e. die) <HI>but be changed,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. How∣ever this is the common lot. Psal. 89.48. <HI>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003351_0007_0FF8176F30E28AA8"/>
No sooner had Man sinn'd but Death had power over him, and began to work towards a dissolu∣tion of this earthly frame. Gen. 2.17. — <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely die.</HI> And it is plain from Scripture that this Threatning Extends to <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity: Rom. 5.12. <HI>Wherefore, as by one man sin entred into the World, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</HI> Men are various ways distinguish'd in the World into high and low, rich and poor, young and old, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> but in this respect they are all upon a level, equally subject to death. And this the Experience of all Ages teacheth. <HI>One Generation passeth away, and another cometh;</HI> — Eccl. 1.4. Rom. 5.14. — <HI>Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinn'd after the similitude of A∣dam's transgression</HI>—. As <HI>infants</HI> who have not been guilty of Actual transgression com∣mitted in their own persons, and yet the sen∣tence of the law takes hold of them, an unde∣diable evidence that <HI>Adam's</HI> first sin is imputed to them; and that we all bring a corrupt Na∣ture into the World with us. It is true, the Children of GOD are deliver'd from the sting and curse of death by JESUS CHRIST, who by dying hath conquered this last Enemy; so that they shall all Triumph, and say, <HI>O death, where is thy sling? O grave, where is thy victory?</HI> 1 Cor. 15.55. However, GOD will have them also taste of this bitter cup as a testimony of His displeasure against their sin, and as a means of purging away the remains of
<PB N="6" REF="003351_0008_0FF81771F55B5510"/>
it, that they may be presented without spot before Him. They must pass thro' this <HI>Jor∣dan</HI> before they obtain Rest in the heavenly <HI>Canaan.</HI> Their Faith in JESUS CHRIST, and other Graces may help them to die well; but will not exempt them from the stroke of death: Heb. 11.13. <HI>These all died in faith</HI> —. They must this way, thro' the valley of the shadow of death, follow the Captain of their Salvation to Glory. They must be bro't down to the dust in order to their being exalted to sit with Him on Thrones in His Fathers King∣dom. Their warfare is not accomplished till they have encountred this Enemy, nor can they say, It is finished, until, with our Saviour, They give up the Ghost. Thus died <HI>Moses</HI> the Ser∣vant of the LORD. Thus <HI>David</HI> after he had served his generation according to the will of GOD, <HI>fell a sleep, &amp; was laid to his Fathers</HI> —. The matter of Fact which the Jews alledged was true, tho' misapplied, Joh. 8.52. — <HI>Abra∣ham is dead, and the Prophets</HI>—. Accordingly, when our Saviour asserts, <HI>If any man keep my saying, he shall never see death,</HI> v. 51. He must be understood of the <HI>second death,</HI> which is eter∣nal, comprehending the destruction of Soul and Body in Hell. Now, by death we are remove'd out of this World, agreably death is call'd a departure, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 6. — The time of <HI>my de∣parture</HI> is at hand. The Soul goeth forth out of the Body, the vital union between them be∣ing dissolvd'd. <HI>Gen.</HI> 35.18. — As her <HI>soul was in departing, for she died</HI> —. And the Body is then carried to the Grave, the House appointed
<PB N="7" REF="003351_0009_0FF81775165B7AF0"/>
for all the living. Death dissolveth the Union, and breaks off the Society there was between the nearest Relations; they are separated for∣ever as to what concerns this life, which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>According to the Course of Nature Pa∣rents forsake their Children, and leave them behind in this World; when they depart out of it by death.</HI> Indeed, it is no uncommon thing to have this order of Nature inverted. We read that of old, <HI>Haran died before his Father Terah,</HI> i. e. "In his sight and presence, he being yet alive, <HI>Gen.</HI> 11. 28. Thus <HI>Aaron, Job, David,</HI> &amp;c. surviv'd to bewail the loss of Children. And alas! how common is this in our day? Upon this account among others the land of darkness may be said to be <HI>without or∣der,</HI> Job 10. 22. The young and strong have the precedency oftentimes, and go to the Grave before the aged and infirm. The lamp of life is not seldom blown out. Diseases &amp; Accidents, as we call them, tho' all under the government of GOD's Providence, often put a period to lives which might endure much longer. We die sooner or later according to the will of the Sovereign GOD, who hath determined our Days on Earth in His Decree, &amp; appointed our bounds which we cannot pass. Job 14.5. <HI>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.</HI> However, according to the course of Nature, as Parents are born into the World first, so they die out of it before their Children. The decays of Nature
<PB N="8" REF="003351_0010_0FF817772E876468"/>
and infirmities of Age gradually grow upon them; we see them decline and wear away un∣der the fatigues and burdens of life, until, as the Candle burns down and goeth out, so the vital heat and moisture being consum'd, they expire. Psal. 90.10. <HI>The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow: for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</HI> This hath been accoun∣ted the Age of Man since <HI>Moses</HI>'s time. Here also we may observe, That it is no strange thing for Parents to be taken away in their full strength, yea, even before middle Age, and so to leave their Children Young, sometimes not ca∣pable of understanding the greatness of their loss; but then, others by the favour of GOD continue till their Children are grown up, and after that they have for some time experienc'd the great benefit of their Presence, Counsels and Prayers, the Parents die and leave them to la∣ment their loss. And the pious Parent may when leaving this World, say to survivours, something as our Saviour to the daughters of Jerusalem; — <HI>Weep not for me, but for your selves</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luck 23, 28.</NOTE>. For when such depart, they go to be with CHRIST, which is far better; they go out of a World of sin and sorrow to that better Country, which is an heavenly, where they are comforted in the glorious Presence of the Lamb, having all tears wiped from their Eyes, and be∣ing made perfect in holiness. The Day of their
<PB N="9" REF="003351_0011_0FF8177B3478FFA8"/>
death is better to them than the day of their birth. But then, by such a bereaving Providence, GOD calls us to lament and mourn; for they are gone from us, and that not to return again to converse with us here. We see their faces no more; we behold their exemplary Conver∣sation no more, receive their Instructions and help no more. And therefore such a Bereave∣ment ought to be lamented, even tho' our Parents should live to a good old Age: When their hoary heads which were a Crown of Glory, being found in the way of righteousness, are laid in the dust, We may well take up a lamentation, and say, the <HI>Crown is fallen — for the glo∣ry of children are their fathers,</HI> Prov. 17.6. However, the Children of GOD have this Con∣solation when exercised with such Bereavements, that tho' <HI>their Fathers</HI> are not, yet the GOD <HI>of their Fathers</HI> lives to take care of them, and fulfil the promises of His Everlasting Co∣venant: Which brings me to,</P>

happy number, and have a right to the precious Privileges of such: They have the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they cry, <HI>Abba Father,</HI> and GOD pitieth them, as a father pitieth his Children. Yea, GOD hath more than the com∣passions of the tender Mother: Isai. 49.5. <HI>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</HI> The love of the Mother, the more tender Sex towards her Offspring, is a strong and constant affection indeed, especially while the child hangs at her Breast; yet such are the moral and natural infirmities of humane Nature since the Fall, that even she may forget — but GOD remembers His Children with an everlasting Love, and is accordingly always ready to succour them under their sorrows, with the most tender compassion. Isai. 66.13. <HI>As one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you</HI> —. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST was with His Disciples as the Father of the Family while on Earth, and when the time of His departure drew nigh, one of the good words He spake to them was that, Joh. 14.18. <HI>I will not leave you comfortless</HI> —: In the Original it is, <HI>Orphans,</HI> bereaved ones: When about to leave this World, as to His bodily presence, He committed them to the care and protection of their heavenly Father. Joh. 17.11. <HI>Holy Father keep thro' thine own Name, those whom thou hast given me</HI> —. And to speak more directly of earthly Parents and Ancestors; the People of GOD comfort themselves from this conside∣ration:
<PB N="11" REF="003351_0013_0FF8178139AE8E48"/>
Isai. 63.16. <HI>Doubtless thou art our Fa∣ther, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou O LORD, art our father, our redeemer, thy name is from everlasting.</HI> Upon which a worthy Expositor observeth, "That they own themselves Father∣less, if He be not their Father, and so cast them∣selves upon Him with whom the <HI>Fatherless findeth mercy,</HI> Hos. 14.3. It was the honour of their Nation that they had <HI>Abraham to their Father,</HI> Mat. 3.9. who was the friend of GOD; and <HI>Israel,</HI> who was a Prince with GOD; but what the better were they for that, unless they had GOD Himself for their Father; for <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> can't help them, they have not the power that GOD hath, they are dead long since, and are ignorant of us, and acknowledge us not, they know not what our case is, nor what our wants are, and therefore know not which way to do us a kindness —. <HI>But thou O LORD art our Father</HI> still. The fathers of our flesh may call themselves <HI>Ever Loving,</HI> but not <HI>Ever Living;</HI> it is GOD only that is the immortal Father, that always knows us, and is never at a distance from us, and therefore <HI>our Redeemer, from everlasting is thy Name,</HI> the Name by which we will know and own thee, it is the Name by which from of old thou hast been known; Thy People have always look'd upon thee as the GOD to whom they might appeal to right them, and plead their cause" <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Henry</NOTE></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="003351_0014_0FF817830B1D5258"/>I would here very briefly speak to a few par∣ticulars, further to shew the Privilege of the Children of GOD contain'd in that good word, <HI>The LORD will take me up:</HI> which word in the Original is observ'd to be used of <HI>taking up and bringing home a stray sheep:</HI> Deut. 22.1, 2.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When Father and Mother forsake, GOD will as a tender Father take up his People, own them as of His Family, and treat them as his Children.</HI> GOD will take them up, and receive them under His Roof. Children are wont to gather to their Fathers House, while their Parents live to enjoy their Compa∣ny, take their Advice, and receive their blessing, &amp;c. Accordingly, when their Parents are removed by death, the LORD <HI>who is a dwelling place to His People in all Generati∣ons,</HI> will grant them Rest and Shelter by His gracious Presence with them, and the care of His good Providence over them. They shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty, and that not solitary, but having Him as a tender Father ready to assist and comfort them. GOD will not cast them off at such a time, No! but will fulfil that word to them, Heb. 13.5. <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> The Scripture refer'd to is suppos'd to be GOD's word to Joshua after <HI>Moses's</HI> death, <HI>Josh.</HI> 1.5. <HI>I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> With this <HI>David</HI> encouraged his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> when the time of his departure drew nigh, 1 Chron. 28.20. <HI>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do

it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD GOD, even my GOD, will be with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee</HI> — When this trouble is near, GOD will not stand afar off, but will be found their present help. He will say to them, <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee, be not dismayed, for I am thy GOD, I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai 41.10.</NOTE>.</HI> They shall have freedom of access to GOD, and may pour out their Com∣plaints before Him with the liberty of Chil∣dren; and GOD will hear them when be∣moaning themselves as <HI>Ephraim,</HI> under His cor∣recting hand, and give that gracious answer, Jer. 31.20. <HI>Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a plea∣sant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will sure∣ly have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.</HI> This the word of GOD further declareth to us, that thro' the patience &amp; comfort of the Scrip∣tures we might have hope: Psal. 103 13—18. <HI>Like as a father pitieth his children: so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame: he remembreth that we are dust. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower the field, so be flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him: and his

righteousness unto childrens children. To such as keep his covenant, and to those that re∣member his commandments to do them.</HI> Now, GOD's owning &amp; treating His People as Chil∣dren may comprehend the particulars which follow, however, I shall distinctly consider them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD will take them up, direct &amp; con∣duct them in the ways which shall be pleasing to Him, and profitable for them.</HI> One great advantage we receive from wise and good Pa∣rents is their Advice &amp; Counsel. "Some of the Ancients say, that the word <HI>Pupil,</HI> which is from the <HI>Latin,</HI> signifieth, <HI>One without sight,</HI> or wanting the apple or pupil of his Eyes; be∣cause being depriv'd of his Parents, he wants the light of counsel and direction, to carry him on in his course thro' this World. What <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> spake to <HI>Hobab</HI> his father in law, is a truth of all good Parents to their Children, "They are to them <HI>in stead of eyes,</HI> Numb. 10.31" <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Caryl. on <HI>Job</HI> 6. 27.</NOTE> But now, when their eyes are clos'd by death, and their thoughts perish, GOD will direct His People, and guide them by His counsel. He who is the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning, will en∣lighten their darkness, and guide them with His Eye. When Children are thus bereaved, they are often in great perplexity, not knowing what to do: Jer. 10.23. — <HI>The way of man is not in himself: it is not in man to direct his steps.</HI> The People of GOD are convinc'd of this truth, and accordingly obey that command, Psal. 37.5.

He will by the care of His watchful Providence, and by the influence of His Word &amp; Spirit effectually say to them, <HI>This is the way, walk ye in it,</HI> when they may be ready to turn to the right hand or to the left; so that they shall make no fatal mistakes, nor be lost in that path which leads to destruction.

But now, GOD will stand on their side, and if any injure them, He will resent and avenge it. Jer. 2.3.— <HI>All that devour him, shall offend: — saith the LORD.</HI> GOD hath forbidden us to <HI>afflict</HI> any Widow, or <HI>fatherless Child</HI> whatsoever, Exod. 22.22. And assureth us that if they cry to Him under such affliction, He will hear their cry, <HI>v.</HI> 23. How much rather will He hear when His Covenant-Children cry to Him under such oppression, and fulfil the threatning which follows: v. 24. <HI>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</HI> GOD is their Judge, and He will do them right. Psal. 10.18. <HI>To judge the fatherless, and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</HI> It is one of His Titles as it were, whereby He makes Himself <HI>known</HI> to us, Psal. 146.9. <HI>The Lord relieveth the fatherless and widow.</HI> When they may be most destitute of humane aid, then will GOD be nigh to them, and in∣compass them with His favour as with a shield. Now they may sing as Psal. 121.5. <HI>The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. v. 7. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</HI> Yea, they shall not only be defended from evil; but be well provided for and supplied with that

good which GOD shall see most needful &amp; sui∣table for them: their <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> who knoweth that they have need of these things, will give them <HI>bread</HI> to eat, and <HI>raiment</HI> to put on, until they are brought to His House which is eternal in the Heavens. <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37.25. I have been young, and now am old, yet <HI>have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</HI> He had not, it may be, observ'd the pious Children of godly Parents brought to begging; and tho' it is not uncom∣mon now for GOD's Children to be poor in this World, yet they are not forsaken when brought thus low; no, GOD hath often given remarka∣ble instances of His fatherly care of such as have had scarce any visible means of support. He that hears the <HI>Ravens</HI> when they cry, and feeds them, will not suffer His <HI>Covenant People</HI> to want the good things of this life which are pro∣per for them; when they pray, as directed by their Lord &amp; Saviour, <HI>Give us this day our daily bread.</HI> How strongly doth the Apostle argue, Rom. 8.32. <HI>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</HI> Let the bereaved be left in ever such poor and distressed circumstances, GOD's promise must be fulfill'd, Psal. 84.11. <HI>The LORD God is a fun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>GOD will take them up, and Comfort them under such a Bereavement.</HI> Pious Pa∣rents are dear to such Children, and their loss in
<PB N="18" REF="003351_0020_0FF8178FA63EAE10"/>
them is in a manner irreparable as to the Crea∣ture: who will, who can do for us as our Fa∣thers that begat us, and our Mothers that bear us? GOD hath implanted in them a strong and almost invincible affection towards the Offspring of their bodies, themselves multiplied; so that they scarce think any thing too much to do or suffer for them: And their removal by death is often attended with peculiar difficulties. Agre∣ably, we have that expression of distressing sor∣row, Psal. 35.14. <HI>I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his Mother.</HI> But when they are in this mournful state, desolate &amp; forsaken, GOD will visit them, and speak comfortably to them; He will sit as One that comforteth the Mourners. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST who knows how to speak a word in season to them that are weary, and hath been anointed with the oyl of gladness above His fellows, will give unto these mourners in Zion, <HI>beauty for ashes, the oyl of joy for mourning</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 45.7. Isai. 61.3.</NOTE> There are many good words spoken to His People in the Scriptures, by which He revives the spirits of these mourners, when He pleaseth. Psal. 68.5. <HI>A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.</HI> Joh. 11.25. — <HI>I am the resurrection, and the life.</HI> Matt. 9.2. — <HI>Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.</HI> Joh. 14.27. <HI>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</HI>

1 Thes. 4.13, 14. Heb. 13.5. <HI>I will never leave thee</HI> —. And by His good Spirit, the Com∣forter, He makes His word a word of life and comfort to their Souls.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>GOD will take them up, and Sanctify such Bereavement to them for saving good.</HI> How grievous soever the Chastening may be for the present, yet shall it <HI>yield to them the peaceable fruit of righteousness.</HI> When GOD chastiseth them it is in measure, as a Father His Children. And by such afflictions GOD hum∣bleth and proves them and doth them good for their latter end; so that they have reason to say with him, Psal. 119.71. <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted</HI> —. Their iniquity is purged, their faith and patience are tryed and improv'd, and they grow in the experience of GOD's fatherly care &amp; pity towards them, which must be for their great profit &amp; advantage.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>GOD will give them the Inheritance of Children, and take them up to dwell with Him for ever in Heaven.</HI> Rom. 8.17. <HI>If children, then heirs; heirs of God, &amp; joynt-heirs with Christ.</HI> GOD Himself will be their Portion, and fulfill the precious Promises of the New-Covenant to them: Psal. 16.5. <HI>The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou main∣tainest my lot.</HI> They have chosen Him as their Portion, and GOD hath given Himself to them as their GOD and Father in CHRIST, &amp; will accordingly bless them with all spiritual Bles∣sings in heavenly things; yea, GOD will bless them indeed, even in the good things of this life, which their earthly Parents leave them; for

He gives these things to His chosen People, be∣ing mindful of His Covenant; and hence it is that <HI>a little which a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked,</HI> Psal. 37.16. In a word, GOD will not leave them, <HI>until he hath done that which he hath spoken to them of</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 28.15.</NOTE>; and put them into the full posses∣sion of all that good which is contain'd in the Promises of which they are the Heirs. GOD will be their <HI>guide to death,</HI> and when they fail here will receive them to the <HI>everlasting Habi∣tations</HI> which He hath prepar'd for them in Heaven, where they shall have a perfect deli∣verance from <HI>all evil,</HI> and the possession of <HI>all good</HI> in the full and everlasting enjoyment of GOD the <HI>chief good;</HI> where they shall meet their godly Parents gone before never to part again, and have every dark Providence clear'd up to their abundant satisfaction. Joh. 14.2, 3. <HI>In my fathers house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go &amp; prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my self, that where I am, there ye may be also.</HI> As Children, they shall dwell in in the House of the LORD for ever, and there will GOD make the sullest manifestations of His fatherly love to them. Agreably, in our <HI>Version</HI> of the <HI>singing Psalms,</HI> the words are thus rendred. <HI>Yet will JEHOVAH gathering, unto Himself me take.</HI> And surely they need no more to compleat their happiness: Ever to be with the LORD, is to be eternally blessed.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P>USE I. Must our Fathers &amp; Mothers for∣sake us, <HI>see here what an evil &amp; bitter thing sin is, by the fruit of it.</HI> It is a root of bitter∣ness bearing wormwood &amp; gall. It kills even them that were most dear to us, and separates the nearest Relations; it puts lover &amp; friend far from us, and our Acquaintance into darkness. It is sin that hath brought misery and death into the World. Rom. 6.23.
<HI>The wages of sin is death.</HI> O let us then turn from all sin as the abominable thing which our souls hate: Let us under such Bereavements, mourn for our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with that godly sorrow which worketh Repentance, and so fly from them unto JESUS CHRIST, who <HI>saves his People from their sins: Blessed are they who thus mourn; for they shall be comforted.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Must our Fathers &amp; Mothers forsake us; <HI>Then we should prize them and do our Duty towards them while we enjoy them; and humble our selves under GOD's correcting Hand, when they are taken from us.</HI> We are very much oblig'd to our Parents: In them GOD hath made a wife and gracious provision for our continuance &amp; comfort in the World; Indeed <HI>earthly Fathers</HI> are but the <HI>fathers of our flesh,</HI> which is also GOD's Creature; GOD is the <HI>Father of Spirits,</HI> He forms the Spirit of Man within him; however, they are instruments in GOD's hand, of our being and

well being here. What creature so helpless as Man in his Infant state? In answer to which, we have the tender love &amp; care of our Parents: Thus did GOD make us to hope when we were upon our Mother's breasts, who must have perish'd if left to our selves. Many and great are the benefits which we receive from our Pa∣rents, especially from pious Parents both rela∣ting to this and a better life, in our comfortable Subsistance, early Dedication to GOD, Educa∣tion, &amp;c. Certainly then, we should highly esteem and dearly love them; we should ho∣nour and obey them in the LORD, as the fifth Commandment requireth, which is the first Commandment "with a special Promise of life and prosperity" annexed to it. Eph. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Honour thy father and mother, (which is the first commandment with promise) That it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live long on the earth.</HI> And if they live to stand in need of our help thro' the infirmities of age, or upon other accounts, <HI>We should shew piety at home, and requite our Parents: for that is good and acceptable before God,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.4. And when GOD removes them from us by death, we should see His hand stretched out against us, and humble our selves under it; we should neither despise the Chastisement of the LORD, nor yet saint when rebuked of Him; but be in subjection to the Father of Spirits that we may live, and enjoy His presence with us when our earthly Parents forsake us. And therefore, as it hath pleased GOD to take my <HI>aged and ho∣noured Father</HI> from my head, whose memory
<PB N="23" REF="003351_0025_0FF8179A89D332A0"/>
will ever be precious to me; I beseech you, Brethren, that ye strive together with me in your Prayers to GOD for me; that I may be enabled so to attend these Duties, as to give glory to GOD, and to be an Ensample to the Flock. I acknowlege my self unworthy of the honour &amp; privilege I enjoy'd in such a Parent, and wou'd abase my self before the LORD, that I made no better improvement of my advantages, especially on spiritual accounts: And while I cry after him, <HI>my Father, my Fa∣ther,</HI> the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof I wou'd earnestly seek to GOD our <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> that the Spirit which was on him may be given unto me, that I may exalt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father's GOD, and follow His Servant as he followed JESUS CHRIST. May the LORD be the GOD and Judge of the Widow; may He take up the Fatherless into the Arms of His everlasting Mercy, and bless them with the Blessings of His well ordered &amp; sure Covenant: And may we all be <HI>followers of them who thro' faith and patience inherit the promises.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III.<HI>We should be above all things con∣cerned to make sure of this, that the everlast∣ing Father is our GOD and Father in CHRIST JESUS.</HI> Our earthly Parents are mortal, and must be taken from us by death; but GOD is the same and His years fail not; He lives for ever the Hope of His Israel and the saviour thereof in all times of trouble: Let us then return to Him from whom we have departed by the Apostacy, confessing we have

sinned in His Sight, and are unworthy to be called His Children; let us cry to Him to ex∣tend His fatherly pity and mercy to us in and by His <HI>beloved Son, whom in the fulness of time He sent forth made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were un∣der the law, that we might receive the A∣doption of Sons,</HI> Gal. 4.4, 5. Let us by His Grace heartily consent to receive JESUS CHRIST according to the New Covenent, then His Father will be our Father, and His GOD our GOD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh 20. 17.</NOTE> Let us <HI>ask</HI> of GOD His <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> that being born again, not of cor∣ruptible Seed, but of incorruptible by the word of GOD which liveth and abideth for ever, we may bear His Image, and bring forth that fruit whereby our heavenly Father shall be glorified. Let us reverence and honour, obey and submit to Him in all things, and be fol∣lowers of Him as dear Children: Then we may rejoyce in Him under all sorrowful Bereave∣ments, and say, <HI>The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock.</HI> We may comfort ourselves with these words, and be assur'd that what ever is taken from us, GOD Himself who is <HI>all in all,</HI> will never forsake us. He will come unto us, and make His abode with us while in this World, and when we shall be here no more, will receive us to His House which is eternal in the Heavens, where we shall be for ever comforted in His Presence, <HI>in whose Presence is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever more.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="25" REF="003351_0027_0FF8179FF2891688"/>IV. I wou'd close the subject <HI>with a word of Exhortation, directed to Parents and Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>To Parents,</HI> in a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be Exhorted, <HI>Early to Pray for your Children, and in this way commend them to be Care &amp; Blessing of the Everlasting Father.</HI></P>
<P>It is one great Privilege which belongs to the Relation of Parents in Covenant with GOD, bless their Children in the Name of the LORD, by asking His Blessing for them. And surely the consideration of your Mortality should quicken you to begin this Duty so soon as you know they begin to live, and to conti∣nue instant in it with all perseverance; for when you are remov'd, you will not be ac∣quainted with their condition as now you are, and if faithful, will be taken up from them to Praise GOD in His Temple above. Now then, lay up a stock of <HI>Prayers</HI> for them which may come down in <HI>Blessings</HI> upon them, even after your decease. You have been instrumen∣tal of conveying sin and death to them. Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> O cry to GOD then that they may experience the power of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and that being cleansed from their sins by the Blood and Spirit of CHRIST, they may live to GOD here, and be prepared to follow you to Heaven, Thus
<PB N="26" REF="003351_0028_0FF817A187BECDA8"/>
<HI>David</HI> pray'd for <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 29.19. <HI>Give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments</HI> —. Seeing you know not the day of your death, how soon and suddenly it may come upon you; attend this Duty daily, <HI>in secret,</HI> and <HI>in your families;</HI> yea, <HI>take them with you</HI> sometimes in your <HI>Retirements,</HI> and let them see your concern for them in your servent Prayers to GOD on their behalf. Thus to attend your duty will be one likely way of enjoying them as Blessings of GOD to you while you live; and in this way, you may with the more comfortable as∣surance commit them to the care of the ever-living GOD, when you leave them at death.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Give them up to GOD in Baptism,</HI> and thus do your endeavour to bring them under the wing and blessing of the everlasting Cove∣nant establish'd with GOD's People, and their Seed in CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>As Children are virtually in their Parents before they are begotten and born into the World, so it hath pleased GOD to include Pa∣rents together with their Children in the Cove∣nant. Thus it was under the first Covenant, the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> made with <HI>Adam,</HI> "not for himself only, but for his Posterity". And thus it is under the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> the Covenant of Grace. GOD promised <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17.7. <HI>I will establish my covenant be∣tween me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an everlasting covenant;
<PB N="27" REF="003351_0029_0FF817A49E6E5050"/>
to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</HI> Which blessing is come on the believing Gentiles thro' JESUS CHRIST, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.14. Let Parents then under the realizing view of the frailty of this life, make hast to lay hold of GOD's Covenant, and to give up themselves and their Seed to Him as their GOD, and that with their whole hearts; that whatever changes pass over your Houses, you may rejoyce with <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23.5. <HI>Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me in everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</HI> In this way, <HI>devote them to GOD,</HI> that He may own them as His Children, and take them up when you forsake them: In this way, <HI>bring them to CHRIST</HI> for His blessing, who said, <HI>Suffer little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Mat. 19.14. In this way, <HI>seek to</HI> GOD that they may be <HI>Saved by the washing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Indeed, we can't say that all who are visibly in Covenant obtain the invisible Grace and saving Blessings of the Covenant: <HI>For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel,</HI> Rom. 9.6. Sad experience teach∣eth us that not a few have with profane <HI>Esau</HI> despised the <HI>Birth-right.</HI> However, this is one of the means of Grace which that GOD hath appointed who alone can command the Blessing; and the consideration of the uncertainty of our own lives as well as the lives of our Children,
<PB N="28" REF="003351_0030_0FF817A74D233478"/>
should make us speedy and very serious in this Covenant transaction with GOD on their be∣half, that we may in faith plead the Promises of GOD's Covenant for them, when we are a∣bout to be taken from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Teach them the Will of GOD, and call upon them to Choose that good Part which can't be taken away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All flesh is as grass,— but the word of the LORD endureth for ever</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet 1.24, 25.</NOTE>. O do your utmost then that they may know the Scrip∣tures from their childhood, and have the laws of GOD written upon their hearts. Labour to instill the principles of Religion into them, and teach them early how they must fear and serve the LORD, while you look to GOD to fulfill His promise: Isai. 54.13. <HI>All thy children shall be taught of the LORD</HI>—. Shew them their sin and misery by the Fall, and the only remedy provided in JESUS CHRIST, the only Name given among Men whereby we can be sav'd. Call upon them to know the GOD of their Fathers, and to choose Him as their GOD. Urge them to make sure of an Interest in CHRIST, and the Blessings of the Covenant; to Repent of their Sins, and make haste to keep GOD's Commandments; that He may never leave them, and that in Him the unchangable GOD, they may have an unfailing Friend and everlasting Portion. You
<PB N="29" REF="003351_0031_0FF817A99A331B88"/>
know not how soon you may be silent in the Grave: O do not delay then to speak to them about the concerns of their Souls, and to teach them the good knowledge of the LORD, that they may be wise for Eternity &amp; to Salvation!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Go before them,</HI> while GOD continueth you with them, <HI>in an holy Exemplary Con∣versation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Walk before GOD</HI> within your house with a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> and <HI>before them,</HI> in a <HI>perfect way;</HI> for it is natural and common for Chil∣dren to imitate their Parents. It is true, they stand in need of <HI>supernatural Grace,</HI> to enable them to follow your pious Examples; how∣ever, the duty is your's, and you must discharge it, looking to GOD to turn their feet to His Testimonies. Be exhorted then to set the great and weighty matters of GOD's law before your Children, not only in <HI>verbal Instructions,</HI> but in a <HI>living Pattern;</HI> that they may be en∣couraged to <HI>follow your faith, considering the end of your conversation.</HI> It may be you have but a little time to be with them, O endea∣vour then to do much, by living much to the honour of GOD, the little time that remains! Take heed you do not lay a stumbling-block before them by living in the <HI>Omission of Duty,</HI> of Family-prayer, of the strict Observa∣tion of the Lord's-day, of a devout Attendance on the Lord's Table, &amp;c. Or, <HI>in the Commission of Sin,</HI> of profaness, of intemperance, lying, dishonesty in dealing, &amp;c. left they fall after
<PB N="30" REF="003351_0032_0FF817ABEBDED9A8"/>
your Example, and GOD <HI>visit the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</HI> O do not walk in that broad way which leads to de∣struction, left they follow you, and you have a dreadful meeting in Hell; but in that narrow way which leads to life, that you may have a joyful meeting in Heaven.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Endeavour to leave your Children with GOD, when you forsake them; and do what you can that they may live in Peace among themselves.</HI></P>
<P>The great work we have to do when we come to die, is to commit our departing Spirits into the Hands of JESUS CHRIST, and so to resign our lives to GOD by Him as a free-will Offering; but this is not all, we shou'd also commit our dear Relatives, and in particular our Children, to the care of the living GOD, when we are leaving them. If you understand that word as an exhortation and promise to GOD's People, it may be fitly applied here, Jer 49.11. <HI>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive, and let thy widows trust in me.</HI> Now then commend them to GOD in a solemn manner, and if GOD give you the opportunity, Charge them to keep His Covenant, that they may happily find that GOD is the GOD of His People, and of their Seed in their Generati∣ons. And in order to their obtaining the gra∣cious Presence of GOD with them, you shou'd do what you can that they may dwell together in Unity; for thus runs the promise, 2 Cor
<PB N="31" REF="003351_0033_0FF817AF18EC5B18"/>
13.11. —<HI>Live in Peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</HI> And here it may not be amiss to say, prudently and seaso∣nably settle your Affairs, that there may be no occasion of unhappy division and alienation upon temporal accounts.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Whatever your hand finds to do</HI> for the welfare of your Children, <HI>do it with your might;</HI> for there is no work nor knowledge in the Grave whither you are going. If there be any Commands or Charges needful for you to give, and them to receive, delay them not, left you be prevented by Death. If you are middle Aged, you may not presume you have time enough before you; for not a few die in their full strength: And if GOD hath spared you to old Age, you had need make haste to attend your duty in these &amp; other respects, that when Death comes, you may take leave of your Chil∣dren with a comfortable hope that GOD will take them up and bless them, as He did <HI>Isaac</HI> after his Father's death, Gen. 25. 11. <HI>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac;</HI> and that you shall have a Seed to <HI>serve</HI> GOD on <HI>earth,</HI> when you are <HI>call'd</HI> up to <HI>Praise</HI> Him in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Let the Exhortation be directed, <HI>to Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be thankful to GOD if He continueth your Parents to you after you are grown up.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003351_0034_0FF817B186ECDF78"/>It is the sorrowful case of many, that their Parents forsake them while very young: If it be otherwise with you, humbly bless GOD, and consider how you may best shew your grateful sense of such a benefit, and improve it to the honour of GOD, and your own advan∣tage. And remember, you are in an especial. manner oblig'd thus to express your thankful∣ness, if your Parents have not only some <HI>ex∣ternal resemblance</HI> of GOD upon them, who is the Father of all, in the authority this Re∣lation gives them over you; but also his <HI>moral Image</HI> in them, which is created <HI>in righteousness and true holiness:</HI> The presence of such Parents who have GOD graciously present with them, is a great savour indeed. Happy, thrice happy the Children! who are thus favour'd of the LORD, know their Privi∣lege, and wisely improve it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Do your utmost that you may be Blessings and Comforts to them, while they live.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' you are grown to years capable of choosing &amp; acting for your selves, and remov'd into distinct Families, yet your obligation to honour your Fathers and Mothers abides with the Relation; tho' indeed the authority of Pa∣rents and obedience of Children are to be exer∣cised after a different manner: Do you then express your filial duty in a manner becoming your riper Age, and labour to be helpful to
<PB N="33" REF="003351_0035_0FF817B405FA3E30"/>
your Parents, even when you are remov'd from under their immediate care. Now endeavour to be under GOD <HI>their Staff,</HI> when they de∣cline thro' age; and do what you can to sweeten and <HI>brighten</HI> the <HI>evil days</HI> which are come upon them, by your good carriage. O despise them not when they are old; but succour them under their infirmities, and let them now have some good fruit of their unwearied care and pains with you. <HI>Heavenly Father! for∣give our sinful defects for Thy Son's sake, with whose perfect Obedience Thou wast ever well pleased.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When your Parents forsake you, Look to GOD to take you up.</HI></P>
<P>Prepare for such a dark hour by taking care to give up your selves to the living GOD, as your GOD and Father, by receiving all the good you can from your Parents, and doing all the good you can to them, while you are con∣tinued to each other. Live under the realizing view of their and your own Mortality. Let their commands, and especially their dying charges have great weight with you. And when they are taken from you, go to GOD in the Name of CHRIST, and depend on Him for all that light and grace, direction and help which you need. Thus you shall find Him the <HI>Father of Mercies</HI> to you; He will take you up, and make up your loss in Himself, and in His CHRTST.</P>
