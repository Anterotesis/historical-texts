<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N making the tour of <HI>Europe</HI> I had the pleasure of writing to you last from <HI>Belgrade</HI> the Capital of <HI>Hungary;</HI> I have since had the curiosity, (before I enter <HI>Poland</HI>) to visit <HI>Transilvania,</HI> a Pro∣vince formerly under the Dominion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> but now belonging to the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany;</HI> and as its <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Waywode, the name given to the Prince or Governor.</NOTE> <HI>Waywode</HI> is almost independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Persons of all Nations, and of every profession under Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made a purchase of the soil from the Barbarians, who were the original Proprietors; he has also obtain'd a grant from the <HI>Emperor</HI> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <HI>Waywode</HI> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great distance from Court, to govern the In∣habitants, who flocked from all Quarters to set∣tle the Country under the sanction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the preservation of their Religion and Liberties, with an absolute sway.</P>
<P>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friendship; but within these ten years past, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them.—The original cause of
<PB N="3" REF="009701_0003_0F7786A4784BED20"/>
which is said to be, the <HI>Waywode's</HI> taking the advantage of the simplicity and ignorance of the Natives in purchasing their Lands, with regard to their nature and situation, as well as description; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they sold. This, (with the trade driven on among them by some Christians, who first made them drunk, and then defrauded them, and pro∣stituted their Females,—a System of religion un∣known to them and their Forefathers) disgusted them to such a degree, that they immediately de∣clared War. The <HI>Turks</HI> joining them, there was then a necessity for the <HI>Waywode</HI> and his Subjects to raise money. The Delegates being assembled to consult the welfare of the Country; insisted that a Tax shou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <HI>Waywode</HI> agreed, but up∣on condition, that all his own shou'd be exempted, as he had large flocks all over the Country— This, the Delegates refus'd, because his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own. He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine; this con∣struction however the Delegates wou'd not admit of. A long dispute then ensued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls shou'd be taxed, which he cou'd not believe was just, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd, they saw no reason why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves shou'd be exempted and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time, laid waste the Frontiers with fire and sword.
<PB N="4" REF="009701_0004_0F7786A511608838"/>
This intestine dispute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting dispo∣sition of the Lord of the soil, that he wou'd rather see a general Massacre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than suffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</P>
<P>A few of the well affected Natives to the Go∣vernment, threw themselves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were as∣sign'd for the maintainance of some, and others were supported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the state of <HI>Transilvania</HI> upon my first arrival at the Capital.</P>
<P>I waited upon his Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle-aged Man of small stature; surrounded with half a Dozen boys who were called Prime Minis∣ters of State; four young Nymps of Circassian breed, and a Calidonian wry necked Musician. The Room was filled with instruments of music. A Violin; a harpsichord; six Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps, He enquired if I under∣stood Musick; I answer'd, some few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he immediately gave me a ge∣neral invitation to accompany him either to the chase (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, e∣very day during my stay at <HI>Weissenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had two days elapsed, when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Piss—Brute— tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengful sect, sprung
<PB N="5" REF="009701_0005_0F7786A743D70840"/>
from the Turks, and Adorers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> as to absolute Fate, but nominal Christians in some other respects, having murder'd the innocent Na∣tives, Man Woman and Child, who were settled in the Country, were in full march to butcher those under the protection of the City. In con∣sequence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however ensued, and the <HI>Way∣wode,</HI> not only put up with the insult, but mean∣ly stoop'd to carress the, rebels; nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their resentment upon the Delegates of the Province, instead of himself. This they agreed to. The Delegates had no way to save themselves from destruction, and preserve the Government from Anarchy; but by appealing to the <HI>Emperor</HI> to be taken under his own protection, and rescued from the oppressions of the Piss—Brute—tarians, and the Tyranny of the <HI>Waywode.</HI> By this strange revolution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and those, who had bravely and generously taken up arms to save his Excellency's wind-pipe from being sever'd in a thousand pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the instability of Courts, and the wonderful Wis∣dom of Ministers of State! It is said his Excellen∣cy's Musical Instruments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been disconcerted ever since; be that as it will; a sudden resolu∣tion was taken to call a Council, wherein it was
<PB N="6" REF="009701_0006_0F7786A7A9C54C60"/>
decreed, that there shou'd no Magistrates hold Commissions under the Government, who had shewn any Love for the <HI>Emperor;</HI> or was not a Piss—Brute—tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</P>
<P>As I had the happiness to be acquainted with Counsellor Wiseman, a most accomplish'd Gen∣tleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greatest integrity through all the political storms and tempests that had threatened the de∣struction of the Province, during the whole time by reason of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <HI>Turk,</HI> he took the first Oppor∣tunity after the Council broke up to communicate to me the substance of the debate upon that im∣portant subject.</P>
<P>His Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one Assertorian in the Commission of the peace or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they seem'd all tinctur'd with a rebellious disposition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor himself. That by their late proceedings, in choosing such men to repre∣sent them, who were his bitter Enemies; and in complaining to the Emperor against him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and either oblig'd to resign his Government, or throw himself under the Pro∣tection of the grand <HI>Turk;</HI> therefore as they had thus shewn their malicious intentions against his Administration they were no longer to be enrol∣led among the Number of his Friends. He also
<PB N="7" REF="009701_0007_0F7786A868F29310"/>
added, that those of the <HI>Emperors</HI>' Religion had behav'd in such a cold indifferent manner (a few in Weissenburgh excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <HI>Emperor</HI> as himself;—that their principles in Religion and the maxims by which they and their Ancestors were govern'd for one Thousand Years, were pecu∣liarly adapted to support the <HI>Emperial Family;</HI>— that these things being consider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his person, or their general concurrence to his mea∣sures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be trusted at such a critical conjuncture. He therefore desir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect was to be trusted as Ma∣gistrates in the Government, besides the Piss— Brute—tarians, a Sect whose principles have ever been diametrically opposite to Monarchy; and not only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has reference to their solomn Leauge and Covenant.</NOTE> <HI>sworn</HI> Enemies to the <HI>Emperial</HI> Family, but murder'd one of the <HI>Emperors</HI> before his own palace; and have always been the foremost in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd against his Suc∣cessors ever since. He also said, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to espouse the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s cause, and whom he "mark'd" out for punishment; he wish'd it cou'd be with the loss of their heads, instead of their Commissions. The Enemies were <HI>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and <HI>Trumponius,</HI> the last he was somewhat sorry for, as he suppos'd his Ancestors were great Mu∣sicians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate their posterity, by which, some Nations call a Jews-Harp.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009701_0008_0F7786A8D3E37610"/>The Generality for the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <HI>Waywode;</HI> but when it came to Counsellor <HI>Wiseman</HI> to give his opinion, he beg'd leave to dissent from the rest of the board; and hoped his Excellency, wou'd, with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his reasons.</P>
<P>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd ex∣cuse him, if he differ'd with him in some of the Political Observations he had just now made; and unto which Messieurs <HI>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</HI> and <HI>Brainless</HI> his Brother Counsellors had signified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a short time <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of the province he ought to use every method in his power to culti∣vate a good understanding with the people;— that as a spirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate such an extensive province, stripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the way of either gaining the good opinion of those who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the most seditious; that tho' his Ex∣cellency was sensible, how little either himself, or the Council troubled themselves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew] there was a necessity of keeping up external appearances, and that it was a useful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;—that if therefore he abandoned the profession of it, he wou'd be held in universal, disesteem by all its Professors;—that if he ap∣peard more zealous for one sect than another, a general Jealousy wou'd take place among the rest, and perhaps unite them all against him; that if
<PB N="9" REF="009701_0009_0F7786A9974D6888"/>
this shou'd happen; the Piss—Brute—tarians, were not the tenth of his Subjects, and consequently cou'd not support him against the other nine;—that if he made an impartial dis∣tribution of places of Profit and Honor in the Government, and establish'd them in all their e∣quitable demands, the <HI>Emperor</HI> wou'd have no ob∣jection towards the continuing of him in his <HI>Vice-Royality;</HI> no complaints cou'd have any weight against him, his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps save him the expence and trouble of a long Journey to defend himself.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Assertorians,</HI> the taking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Prede∣cessors, wou'd perhaps, effectually regain their Friendship; make them drop the prosecution of their Appeal; and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to disoblige. <HI>Pottonius,</HI> (who appears to be particularly singled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably distinguish'd himself this twenty Years past, for his Integrity, in faithfully dis∣charging the Office of a Magistrate; his fortune places him above the fear or affection of Mankind, in the destribution of Justice; and therefore he does your Excellency as much honor in ac∣cepting of the Commission, as you can do him in giving it. As to those of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Priests; and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater
<PB N="10" REF="009701_0010_0F7786AA54A40EC0"/>
lengths to serve you, than any other Sect among us in some particulars.</P>
<P>Have they not abandoned their former Princi∣ples; violated every obligation that was either civil or sacred, or that bound them by the ties of Conscience or honor to be faithful to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in order to support your Cause? Have they not prostituted their Temple, (a place solemnly de∣dicated for pious uses) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in? Has not their Altar been profaned by the unhallowed hands of Turks, Jews, Infidels and Piss—Brute—tarians? And all this in favor of your Excellency.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and others of the <HI>Emperor's</HI> Profession, whose characters have been irreproachable, and whose Virtues have made them rever'd by their Country, shall they become the objects of your Excellency's disapprobation for no other reason, than that they still continue to have a regard for the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and cannot ea∣sily conquer their old prejudices in favour of the Emperial Court?—Time might bring them over as well as others; but such rash and precipitate measures, will create a Jealousy throughout all <HI>Transilvania,</HI> as if your opposition to them was purely out of spite to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> for whom they wou'd be made a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>Your Attachment to the Piss—Brute—tarians is somewhat remarkable, as they have been the cause of all the trouble that has happen'd in the Government. Had there never been a Rebellion amongst them here, your Excellency wou'd ne∣ver
<PB N="11" REF="009701_0011_0F7786AB12B346F8"/>
have been brought into such difficulties. Had the Traitors been punish'd according to their De∣merit, there never wou'd have been an Appeal to <HI>Vienna.</HI> How then can you place your chief con∣fidence in a sect who have been the sole cause of your misfortunes? These invincible arguments stagger'd his Excellency; but being a Man of weak Intellects, and abandon'd (like <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The last King of the Assyrian Empire, who for his Ex∣tream Effeminacy was so disdain'd by his own Captains, that they conspired against him. When he saw himself so strait∣ned, that there was no escaping, he turned valiant, and making a funeral pile of all his precious Things (Fiddles) he burnt himself in his Palace, and went out in a blaze.</P> <BIBL>See a full account of him in Justin.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Sardana palus</HI>) to wine, musick and Women, was soon confirm'd in his former opinion, by his other Counsellors, who told him, that all the People in the Province were a set of Villains, but the Piss—Brute—tarians and themselves, and hop'd he wou'd govern himself accordingly. Thus the Council broke up. But I am afraid I have trans∣gress'd the bounds of a single Letter, and have only tired your patience with some few hints about the Politicks of a Country, the name of which is scarcely known in <HI>America.</HI> You see by this how I improve my time in my Travels, and I hope to return to <HI>America</HI> equally accom∣plish'd with those of my Countrymen who have made this Tour before me. Adieu, dear Sir, at present! You need not expect to hear from me,
<PB N="12" REF="009701_0012_0F7786AC32DCC468"/>
till my arrival at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> where an account of the Politicks of <HI>Poland,</HI> will be the subject of my next.</P>
