<P>THE Governor having been informed last Week, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that in Conse∣quence of several Invitations sent by this Government, at sundry Times, to the <HI>Indians</HI> living on and near the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> Chief <HI>Beaver,</HI> and the Deputies of other Tribes of Western <HI>Indians,</HI> would be at <HI>Lancaster</HI> on the Eighth Instant; sat out from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> attended by several Gentlemen, and came here on the Ninth In∣stant, and found that the <HI>Indians</HI> had arrived the Evening before.</P>
<P>On the Tenth the Governor, attended by the Gentlemen abovementioned, with several of the Inhabitants of this Town, paid a Visit to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and the other <HI>Indians,</HI> at their Encamp∣ment, about a Mile from the Town, where he took them by the Hand, and bid them heartily welcome; and having seen that they were well accommodated, took his Leave, and came back to Town.</P>
<P>The Governor Yesterday Afternoon received a Message from <HI>Beaver,</HI> that having been a long Time from Home, they would take it very kindly if he would be pleased to open the Conferences with them To-morrow Morning, without waiting any longer for the <HI>Six Na∣tions,</HI> as he and those <HI>Indians</HI> with him were the first invited, and were only made acquainted with the coming of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> since they left their Homes.</P>
<P>The Governor returned them for Answer, that the Interpreter was not come; but as soon as he should arrive, he would immediately proceed to Business with them, and give them Notice when to attend.</P>
<P>This Afternoon arrived Six <HI>Tuscarora Indians,</HI> who waited on the Governor, and ac∣quainted him, that they were sent to him by those of their Nation, living at <HI>Onohoquage,</HI> on the Upper Waters of the <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> with a Letter; which, after the Ceremony of open∣ing his Eyes and Heart, by a String of Wampum, they delivered to him, and it follows in these Words.—</P>
<P><HI>Lower Tuscarora, Onohoquage, July</HI> 8, 1762.</P>
<P><HI>Great Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"I the Bearer, <HI>Augus,</HI> Chief of the Nation, am, and ever have been, a Friend and Brother to the <HI>English,</HI> and to the Interest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> now wait upon your Excel∣lency, by Agreement, to transact Affairs of Importance; and heartily rejoice that the <HI>Five Nations</HI> have agreed to, and (as I hear) have actually returned the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, to enjoy the Liberties of their own Nation.—And I the said <HI>Augus,</HI> Chief, with my whole Tribe, have ever been for Peace with the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and have minded the Things of Religion, and of a private Life. And as true Friends to the Protestant Cause, we congratulate your Excellency, our Brother, and all the <HI>British</HI> Nation, on the various Con∣quests obtained against the common Enemy, and especially on the total Reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> with its Dependences, being greatly delighted with the happy Prospect that now arises, with∣out Clouds. As we rejoice to hear that the Prisoners are resigned, so we hope a Peace will
<PB N="4" REF="009412_0003_0F7404D2CA1C0EF8" MS="y"/>be established between us, the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> colonies on the Continent; a Peace that shall be lasting and undisturbed, while the Waters run, and the Grass grows.—We should be glad to be informed of the State and Behaviour of our Brethren in <HI>Tuscarora Valley,</HI> and to have some Directions about the Way, as we propose to make them a Visit; and also should be glad of a Pass, or Recommendation in Writing, that we may be friendly received on the Way, and at the Valley.</P>
<P><HI>I am your Brother, AUGUS, Chief."</HI></P>
<P>The above was taken from the Mouth of the said <HI>Augus, Tuscarora</HI> Chief, by the Help of an Interpreter, by me <HI>ELI FORBES, Missionary at</HI> Onchoquage.</P>
<P>After the Governor had read the Letter, they delivered him a Belt of Wampum, to con∣firm the Sincerity of their Professions contained in the said Letter.</P>
<P>They then delivered the Governor another Belt from the <HI>Nanticokes</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> as a Te∣stimony of their joining with the <HI>Tuscaroras</HI> in the same sincere Professions.</P>
<P>The Governor acquainted them that he would take the Letter into Consideration, and at a proper Time return them an Answer.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese, Twightwees, Wawachtanies, Tuscaroras,</HI> and <HI>Kick∣apoes,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I clean your Bodies from the Dust and Sweat, and open your Eyes and Ears, that you may see your Brethren with Chearfulness, and hear distinctly what I have to say to you at this Conference.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (480)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I open the Passage to your Hearts, that you may speak freely, and with∣out Reserve, as Brethren ought to do when they meet together.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (260)</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009412_0004_0F7404D3796E2600"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now a great while since we have had the Pleasure of meeting one another in Council, wherefore I take this Opportunity of condoling with you for the Losses you may have sustained by the Death of any of your People, and with this String I gather up the Bones of our de∣ceased Brethren, and bury them decently, according to the Custom of our Forefathers.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (460)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I disperse the dark Clouds, which for many Years have hung over our Heads, and prevented our seeing each other, that we may for the future meet and confer to∣gether, as our Fathers used to do, and brighten and renew the Covenant Chain of Friendship, for our mutual Benefit and Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (300)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the Council-Chamber hath contracted much Dust, for Want of Use for some Years past, and hath also been stained with Blood, I, with this String, sweep it quite clean, and wipe all Blood from off the Seats, that we may sit down and confer together, without seeing any Thing to interrupt us, or make us uneasy.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (280)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having now wiped your Eyes, opened the Way to your Hearts, and cleansed the Council Seats, I, by this Belt, take you by the Hand, and bid you heartily welcome, and assure you, that I am ready to do every Thing in my Power to strengthen and preserve that Brotherly Love and Friendship, which so long subsisted between your Ancestors and His Majesty's Sub∣jects of this Government.</P>
<P>A Belt.</P>
<P>The Governor then told them he had finished what he had to say to them at present, and that if they were prepared to speak to him at this Time, he was ready to hear them; if not, he would appoint another Time for that Purpose.</P>
<P>Beaver, <HI>the Chief of the</HI> Delawares, <HI>then spoke to the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We all rejoice to hear what you have said to us, and are glad that you have cleansed us, and have spoke to us in the Manner which our Forefathers used to do to one another. As we speak different Languages, we shall be glad of an Opportunity of consulting among ourselves, and shall deliver what we have to say to you To-morrow Morning.</P>

<P>The Governor having told the <HI>Indians</HI> that he was ready to hear them,</P>
<P>Beaver, <HI>the</HI> Delaware <HI>Chief, spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE heard what you said to me Yesterday, and am well pleased with it. You have cleansed me, opened my Eyes, and cleaned my Ears in the same Manner as our Fore∣fathers used to do. You will now listen to me attentively; with this String I also open your Eyes, and clean your Ears, that you may see me, and hear what I have to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When our Grandfathers used to meet together, they wiped the Tears from one anothers Eyes, and with this String I now wipe the Tears from your Eyes, that you may see clearly your Brothers now before you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009412_0005_0F7404D43A220CB0"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When our Grandfathers used to meet our Brethren, they cleansed each others Hearts, and took away all Grief and Sorrow out of them:—By this String I do likewise clean your Hearts, and remove all Sorrow and Grief from them, and strengthen your Breath, that you may speak more freely to your Brothers here before you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is a great While since we saw one another; we here present are really very glad to see you and all our Brethren well.—It is about four Years ago since we first received any Messa∣ges from you, and ever since we have been employed in carrying good News to all the Na∣tions round, who were rejoiced to hear it from you. And we have been likewise ever since endeavouring to bring in your Flesh and Blood, as you required it of us. Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> and the Commander at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> know that we have delivered many of them, and now we bring a few more of them to you. There are some behind yet, and they meet with good Usage, and live as we do, and chuse to stay with us; but I hope they will come to you after some Time, because you live better than we do.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I heard you Yesterday, and was much rejoiced to hear you, as were all your Brethren here present. You told me you had removed all the dark Clouds that hung over us. I am rejoiced that the dark Clouds are dispersed, so that we can see one another clearly.</P>
<P>By this Belt I do, on my Part, disperse the Clouds. Now, Brother, let us join heartily, and put our Hands together, to put away the Clouds.</P>
<P>If we should see the Clouds rise again, let us join to remove them, and keep Peace toge∣ther, so that our Children and Grandchildren, when they meet, may rejoice to see one ano∣ther, and live to great Ages in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are rejoiced to see one another; all the dark Clouds are now scattered, and the Sun shines clear upon us, and all the Nations who are our Friends. We see plainly that good Road which our Grandfathers used, when they travelled to your Council Fire, to consult about our Affairs, when we lived in Friendship.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We will join with you to keep that Road open and good; I assure you it was never yet quite stopt up; we find our old Council Fire, which our Grandfathers made, is still burning; now by this Belt I collect dry Wood to put to the Fire, and make it bigger, so that the Smoke may rise to the Skies; when other Nations see it, they will know by the Light that I have been in Council with my Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Beaver <HI>then got up, and holding a Belt in his Hand, said,</HI></P>
<P>This Belt we received last Fall from Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> at <HI>Fort-Detroit,</HI> who then in∣formed us, that he had heard of the good Work of Peace in which we had been engaged with our Brethren the <HI>English;</HI> which Belt represents us, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> in the Middle, and the Western Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> at one End, and the <HI>English</HI> at the other, Hand in Hand, together holding fast the Chain of Friendship; and assured us, that if we held this Chain of Friendship fast, our Children and Grandchildren should grow up, and live to great Ages.—We were so pleased with this, that we put it into our Hearts, and have always kept it there till now.</P>
<P>And now, Brother, you have heard from me what passed between Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> and me.—I assure you I will actually do what was desired of me, and hold fast this Chain of Friendship. I assure you I will always do my Part in keeping this Friendship firm, and the Nations to the Westward will do the same. I desire all you, my Brethren, will be strong, and join heartily in keeping this Friendship alive; which if you do, you and your Grand∣children shall arrive at a great Age.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you will take Pity on those of our Brothers that live or come amongst you, and be kind to them. Our Brethren live among you, because they love you. When any of our Brothers the <HI>English</HI> come amongst us, we always take Pity on them, and give them Victuals, to make their Bodies strong; and we desire that you will do the same to such of us as come amongst you, or live with you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009412_0006_0F7404D505B75160"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have no more to say at present; I shall wait to hear what you have to say to us at ano∣ther Time. You desired me to bring other Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> with me, and I have brought them a great Way, who also wait to hear what you have to say.</P>
<P>The Governor then acquainted <HI>Beaver,</HI> that he was well pleased to hear what they had said to him; and that he received it into his Heart, and should take a proper Opportunity to give them an Answer.</P>
<P>The Governor rose and went to the Place where the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners sat, and received them one by one, from the Hands of King <HI>Beaver,</HI> and here follow their Names.

<P>FRIDAY, AUGUST 13, 1762. This Afternoon <HI>Tokahaion,</HI> and a Number of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> coming to Town, about Fifteen of them waited on the Governor, at his Lodg∣ings, and <HI>Tokahaion</HI> spoke to the Governor as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We were some Time ago invited by you, and our Brethren the <HI>Quakers</HI> of this Province, to come to this Treaty at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> with our Cousins the <HI>Delawares.</HI> Agreeable to this Invitation, we came down as far as <HI>Harris</HI>'s Ferry, where we heard that you intended to re∣turn Home To-morrow, which induced us to make all the Haste we could to this Place, that we might have the Pleasure of seeing you. On our Way one of our Brethren died, but our Hurry was so great that we threw his Body aside, and did not so much as stay to bury him. We are just come to Town, and pay you this Visit to take you by the Hand, and let you know we are glad to see you. We must request of you to order your People to lock up all Rum, and not let our <HI>Indians</HI> have any, till the End of our Conferences.—He added, that they had seen the Cabbins which had been built to accommodate them, but that they were at so great a Distance from the Place where their Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> were lodged, that they could not conveniently discourse with them; wherefore he desired that others might be provided near to them To-morrow.</P>
<P>The Governor took them by the Hand, and after bidding them welcome, told them that they were misinformed respecting his designing to return Home To-morrow; that as he heard they were on their Way, he had waited some Days, in Expectation of their coming, and was now glad to see them; that he would do every Thing in his Power, during their Stay here, to render their Situation easy and agreeable to them, and would give strict Orders that no Rum should be sold to them; that the Field where the <HI>Delawares</HI> were encamped, being too small to accommodate them, he had pitched on a Place which he judged most convenient, where Cabbins had been built, by his Order, for their Reception, at a considerable Expence of Time and Money, which he hoped they would be well pleased with; but if, on Trial, they should still be dissatisfied with that Situation, he would remove them where they thought most proper; and that when they had rested themselves, after the Fatigues of the long Journey they had come, he would speak to them, and give them sufficient Notice of the Time, that they might be prepared to meet him in Council.—They were refreshed with a Draught of Beer, and then took their Leaves, and departed.</P>

<P>THE Governor sent a Message to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and those that came along with them, to acquaint them, that he was going into Conference with the Western Na∣tions, at which they might be present, if they pleased; and on their coming in, and taking their Seats, the Governor spoke to the Western <HI>Indians</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese, Twightwees, Wawachtanies, Tuscaroras,</HI> and <HI>Kick∣apoes,</HI></P>
<P>I return you Thanks for your Speeches of Yesterday, which were very agreeable to me; and I shall now give you an Answer to such Parts thereof as require one.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Before I take Notice of what you said Yesterday, let me remind you of the strict Friend∣ship which was established with your Forefathers, by our old Proprietor <HI>William Penn,</HI> on his first Arrival in this Country, and how happily it subsisted between them and their Chil∣dren, till the Troubles which unfortunately broke out some few Years ago, and stopt up the Road between us. The many Messages which we have since, from Time to Time, sent you, by <HI>Frederick Post</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the great Pains we have taken to drive away the Evil Spirit, plainly shew how sincerely we have been disposed to renew that Friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009412_0008_0F7404D6B5E47E58"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You acquainted me, that after receiving our first Message about Place, which was about four Years ago, you made it known to all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations on this Side, and over the Lakes, who were glad to hear the good News; and as we desired you to deliver up our Flesh and Blood, you say that you have, from Time to Time, delivered up many at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> to the Commanding Officer, and to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> and that you now have brought in a few, which you delivered to me Yesterday. You likewise say, you have yet others in your Possession, and that some of them chuse to live with you; but you made no Doubt of their coming to us some Time hence; as we live better than the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>For the Prisoners that you have delivered at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> as well as for those you have now brought along with you, and delivered to me, I return you my hearty Thanks; but you must remember, that on re-establishing and renewing the antient Chain of Friendship with us, you repeatedly engaged to deliver us all our Flesh and Blood, which you have taken from us, by the Instigation of the Evil Spirit. On these Assurances and Engagements we have relied, and as we cannot enjoy the Blessings we expected from that Peace, till the Parents and Relations of those Prisoners have them restored to them, I must insist on your taking every Measure in your Power to deliver them up, agreeable to your Engagements, which will be the only Means of strengthening and establishing a lasting Peace, to us and our Children, yet unborn.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt of Thirteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You Yesterday, by this Belt, said you would join with me in dispersing the dark Clouds, which have for some Time hung over our Heads; and desired I would join with you, in hearty Endeavours to prevent any more Clouds from rising, or if they should chance to rise, from coming to an Head.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>GOD, who made all Things, has given us Eyes to see, and Tongues to speak to each other, freely and openly; and I assure you, if I should see any little Clouds arise, at never so great a Distance, I will take every Measure in my Power to prevent their encreasing, and communicate it to you forthwith; and if you do the same to me, at all Times, it will prevent any Clouds from gathering to an Head, so as to disturb the public Peace and Tranquility, which have been lately so happily established between us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gave me great Satisfaction Yesterday, to hear you declare your Intentions to keep open the Council Road between your Nation and us. As a small Interruption on that Communi∣cation may be attended with dangerous Consequences to us both, I heartily join with you in keeping the Road open, and perfectly clear from Obstructions, for our mutual Use and Advantage.</P>
<P>I likewise take it kind in you to heap up dry Wood on our Council Fire, and I, on my Part, shall still add more Wood to it, that the Smoke thereof may be seen by the most di∣stant Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> to the Sun-setting, that are in Friendship with His Majesty's Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Yesterday you shewed me a Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, which you say you received from Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> last Fall, at the Conference he held with all the Western Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Fort-Detroit,</HI> repeating what he said to you on it; all which Trans∣actions there I am acquainted with, by Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> who, as His Majesty's Superin∣tendant of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, did then renew the antient Covenant Chain of Friendship, in Be∣half of all His Majesty's Subjects, with all those Western Nations of <HI>Indians.</HI> You say further, that since you received that Covenant Belt, you laid it close to your Heart; and, by this Belt, you assure me that you, and all the Western Nations, are determined to adhere strictly to that Treaty and Renewal of Friendship; and desire me to be strong, and hold it fast.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You must remember, that you then not only promised Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to deliver up all our Flesh and Blood, who were Prisoners in your several Towns and Countries; but that this Promise was an express Condition of that Treaty, made between him and you. This Matter lies so near to my Heart, that I should not act as your true and sincere Friend, if I did not speak with the greatest Freedom and Plainness to you about it, and tell you again, that it is impossible we can look upon you as our Brethren, if you detain from as our Flesh and Blood; we cannot sleep quietly in our Beds, till we see them all; our very Dreams are disturbed on their Account; we demand of you nothing more than the Right which God and Nature has given us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009412_0009_0F7404D736E70208"/>
If we had among us ever so few of your Children, would you think that any Professions of Friendship we could make to you were sincere, if we withheld them from you but for one Day? Your Brother <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> may remember, that at our first consering with him, at <HI>Easton,</HI> we had then one of your People in Prison, and he thought it so grievous a Thing, that he told us he could not speak freely to us, and should look upon what we said as coming not from our Hearts, but from our Mouths only, until the said Prisoner was restored to him; which was immediately done. Can you then delay doing us that Justice, which you your∣selves expected and received from us! We do not well understand your Meaning, when you say, some of the Prisoners chuse to live with you. If you intend it as a Reason for not deliver∣ing them up, till they consent to come, we must inform you, that we cannot admit of it. They were born Subjects of our Great King, and as such, he has a Right to demand them. You have, it is true, by the Delivery of some of the Prisoners, performed your Agreement in Part; but as we know, and you acknowledge, there are a great many yet behind, we now insist positively, that you do not fail, immediately on your Return, to collect every one that remains among you, and deliver them up to us. Relying therefore on your Honesty, and that you will faithfully comply with an Engagement you have so solemnly made with us, I do, by this Belt, in Behalf of all His Majesty's Subjects of this Province, lay Hold of that Covenant Belt, and will keep it fast, that we, our Children, and Grandchildren, may long enjoy the Blessings of Peace, and live together as Brethren, tilt they are old Men.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Fifteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the kind Entertainment which you always give to any of our People who live with you, or come among you. I am persuaded, that such of you who have either lived or come amongst us occasionally, have always found that we received and treated them with the same Kindness that we used to do. We are Brethren, and while we live and love like Brethren, we shall be sure to give one another a Share of what we have.</P>

<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire,</HI> LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor, addressing himself to the <HI>Indians</HI> present, spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six Nations, <HI>and all other our Brethren now present,</HI> We are glad to see you, and with this String we bid you heartily welcome.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>So long a Journey as you have now taken must have been very fatiguing, and made your Bodies very dirty; with this String therefore I clean your Bodies, and wipe off all the Sweat and Dirt from them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you came along, you must have hurt your Feet with the Stones, and torn your Legs with the Bushes and Briars; I therefore apply some healing Oil to them, and make them well.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I open your Eyes, and clean your Ears, that you may see your Brethren clearly, and hear distinctly what they shall have to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I clear your Throats, and open the Passage to your Hearts, that we may confer together freely and affectionately, as our Forefathers used to do.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having now cleansed your Bodies, opened your Eyes and Ears, cleared your Throats, and made a Passage to your Hearts, I am now ready and disposed to hear every Thing that you have to say to me.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Thomas King <HI>stood up, and spoke as follows,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are well pleased to hear what you have said to us, and as we are of different Nations, and speak different Languages, we shall take Time to consider and explain what you have
<PB N="11" REF="009412_0010_0F7404D995B42ED0"/>said, and To-morrow, after Breakfast, I shall give you Notice when we shall be ready to speak to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I take this Opportunity to acquaint you, that all our Guns, Hatchets, and other Things, are out of Repair, and we beg you will give Orders that they may be forthwith mended.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor granted them their Request, and told them their Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be mended, and desired that they might be brought to the Council House, for that Purpose.</P>

<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON; <HI>Esquire,</HI> LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor having acquainted the <HI>Indians</HI> that he was ready to hear what they had to say,</P>
<P>Beaver, <HI>a</HI> Delaware <HI>Chief, spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I do not chuse to speak now myself, as I do not speak clearly and distinctly, and there∣fore shall appoint this <HI>Indian,</HI> named <HI>Cleghiccon</HI> (in <HI>English, Simon</HI>) to speak for me.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Cleghiccon <HI>spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Day before Yesterday you spoke to me, and I have heard you, and we your Brethren, the Western <HI>Indians,</HI> have all been consulting about it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I now inform you, in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <HI>Tawwas,</HI> they have none of your Flesh and Blood left in their Towns, for they have delivered them all up to you: Likewise in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> they have delivered them all up also, and have none left; Also on Behalf of the <HI>Wawaghtanies,</HI> they have none of your Prisoners, for they have also delivered them all up: And lastly, on Behalf of another Nation, called the <HI>Kickapoes,</HI> they say they never had any Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Day before Yesterday I heard what you said, and I assure you I am very well pleased with it. From what you have said, I suppose this Matter of the Prisoners to be the principal Business for which you invited us here.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have told you I left some of your Flesh and Blood where I came from, and I assure you I look upon them as my own Flesh and Blood, and I assure you again, you shall see them some Time hence.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am very well pleased that you have demanded them now, and assure you, you shall have every one of them that remain with us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that you told me, we should deliver all the Prisoners at <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> and I shall be glad you would now shew to me the Persons here whom you shall appoint to receive those our Friends, and we shall be glad of it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then Beaver stood up, and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to say to you. We, the Western <HI>Indians,</HI> have nothing further to say to you. You know that we spoke three Days ago to you, about the Friendship between us.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009412_0011_0F7404DAA942AEE0" MS="y"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The next Nation that have a Mind to speak to you are our Grandchildren, the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and they are now about to speak.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Miskapalathy, <HI>a</HI> Shawanese, <HI>rose up and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard what you and the Chief Men have been confering about, and now I desire you will hear your younger Brothers, the <HI>Shawanese.</HI> Our Chief Men are not here, but we are sent by the Chief Men, to speak for them, and what we say comes from their Hearts. There are several of our Nation here, though but two of us are deputed by our Chiefs.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am very well pleased to hear you have cleansed our Council House. Now, though we who are lest are like Boys, I assure you we will assist you to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Council Chamber, and we will do it always from our Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have heard what I had to say last Fall: <HI>George Croghan</HI> knows it, and I suppose you know it. I told him then, that I would cut all the Prisoners loose, and set them at Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard what you said to my Grandfathers, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> respecting the Demand of your Flesh and Blood, and I am very well pleased with your Demand; and I now assure you I am in a Hurry to get Home, for they, your Flesh and Blood, yet remain there.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard what you said. Now I shall depart very soon. I expect to meet my People, and all the Prisoners, at <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> where I shall deliver them up, and you shall then hear what I shall have further to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Now you have heard what I have said to you, and it is all I intend to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I now want to mention something to you about our Trade with you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We of the <HI>Shawanese Twightwees, Ottaways, Wawaghtanies,</HI> and <HI>Kiekapoes,</HI> desire you will take Pity on us. Our Chief Men at Home have their Eyes on us Boys, who came with our Grandfathers, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> to talk with you about Friendship. We have now con∣cluded our Friendship with you. I now desire you will open a Trade with us, and that you will not be too hard in it. If you open a Trade among the back Nations, we desire to know at what Prices you can afford your Goods.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor asking the Names of the two <HI>Shawanese</HI> Chiefs, or Deputies, was informed they were called <HI>Miskapalathy,</HI> or the <HI>Red Hawke,</HI> and <HI>Wapemashaway,</HI> or the <HI>White Horse.</HI> The Governor told them he had heard what they had said, and it was very agreeable to him, and that he would give them Notice when he should return them an Answer.</P>

<P>Listen to me, while I give you an Answer to the Speeches that you made to me on <HI>Monday.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009412_0012_0F7404DB030CC300"/>
You spoke to me in Behalf of your Grandchildren, the <HI>Tawwas, Twightwees, Wawaghta∣nies,</HI> and <HI>Kickapoes,</HI> acquainting me that they had respectively delivered up all our People, who were Prisoners in their Towns during the War</P>
<P><HI>Brether,</HI></P>
<P>Let them know, that we esteem this as the greatest Mark they could have given us of the Sincerity of their Friendship, and by this Belt we return them our hearty Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You told us that our demanding the Prisoners at this Time, and in the Manner we have done it, was very agreeable to you; and you supposed it was the principal Business for which we invited you here.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You judge right, in thinking that the Affair of our Prisoners was a principal Reason of our inviting you here; it really was so, for we had it very much at Heart.</P>
<P>Another Reason of our desiring to see you was, that we might renew our antient Friend∣ship, and brighten and strengthen the Covenant Chain, which so long and happily subsisted between our Ancestors. This last has now been done to our mutual Satisfaction, and it has given me, and all the good People present, the highest Pleasure to hear from your own Mouths that, agreeable to our Demand, you are determined to deliver up all the Prisoners that remain in your Towns, to such Persons as I shall appoint to receive them, at <HI>Pittsburgh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have not yet concluded upon the Persons to be sent to <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> for that Purpose, but you may be assured I shall very soon; who, when they come, will bring with them a Mes∣sage and full Credentials from me; by which you will know, that they are deputed by me to receive the Prisoners from you. I propose they shall be at <HI>Pittsburgh</HI> the Second Day of <HI>October</HI> next, by which Time I expect you will have collected all of them, and brought them to that Place.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We shall now return an Answer to your Grandchildren the <HI>Shawanese.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the,</HI> Shawanese,</P>
<P>You told me, at your last Meeting, that you were pleased to hear what had passed between us and your Grandfathers, and with our having cleaned the Council Chamber, which you said you would always assist in keeping clean. You told us also, that your Chief Men are not here, but have deputed you to speak for them, and that what you shall say comes from their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As we have been very sincere and open in every Thing we have said to your Grandfathers, we should have been glad that more of your Chiefs had been here, to have heard it; but as they are not, we desire you will acquaint them, and all your Nation, that we are extreamly well disposed towards them, and are determined to hold fast the Chain of Friendship that has been so happily renewed between us, and are glad to hear you will always readily assist us to keep the Council Chamber clean.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You told me that you had sent me Word last Fall, by Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> that you would cut all the Bands of the Prisoners loose, and set them at Liberty; that you were pleased to hear the Demand I made of your Grandfathers, that they might all be delivered up; that you expect to meet your People, and all the Prisoners, at <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> where you will deliver them; and that you are in a Hurry to go Home, for that Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> delivered me your Message last Fall, and I was very well pleased to hear you had concluded to set out People at Liberty; and I am the more so, to hear that you expect your People may be on the Way to <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> with the Prisoners, and that you will deliver them up immediately; and your desiring to return Home forthwith, for that Purpose, con∣vinces me you are in earnest, and I much approve of it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You desired we would open a Trade with you, and the other Western Nations, and not be too hard in our dealing with them. I must address my Answer not only to you, but to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and all present, who I desire may listen attentively to it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009412_0013_0F7404DBB7A76408" MS="y"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Trade is a Business of Importance, and what I intended to mention to you all at this Meet∣ing. You know that, for some Years past, this Government hath kept a great Store at <HI>Pitts∣burgh,</HI> in order to supply you with Goods, in Exchange for your Skins and Furs, near your own Homes. Good Men have been appointed to regulate the Prices of our Goods, and your Skins, and great Care has been taken that you should not be cheated, or imposed upon, by those who have, from Time to Time, kept the Provincial Store; but I am sorry to inform you, that the Charges of carrying our Goods, and bringing back your Skins, so many Hun∣dred Miles, on Horseback, are so high, that it is a great Discouragement to that Trade, and we lose a great Deal of Money by it every Year, insomuch that I sear it will drop, unless your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will consent to let us go, with our Canoes, up the West Branch of <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> as far as we can, and build a few Store-houses on the Banks of that River, to secure our Goods in, as we pass and re-pass. This will cut off a long Land Carriage, and may be a Means of encouraging the Continuance of the Trade with you, and enabling our People to sell their Goods to you at a reasonable Rate.—We intend to speak to your Uncles on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have now finished my Answers to your several Speeches, but I have still something parti∣cularly to say to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and our Brethren of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation, living at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and desire you will attend to me.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren the</HI> Delawares,</P>
<P>I take this Opportunity to inform you, that about Six Years ago your Brother <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> made a Complaint against the Proprietaries, wherein he charged them with defrauding the <HI>Delawares</HI> of a Tract of Land, lying on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> between <HI>Tohiccon-Creck</HI> and the <HI>Kittatinny Hills.</HI> He alledged, that this Complaint was not made by him, on his own Account, but on Behalf of the Owners of the Land, many of whom, he said, lived at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> This Dispute, Brethren, was, by mutual Consent, refered to our Great King GEORGE, who ordered Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to enquire fully into the Matter, and make his Report to Him, that Justice might be done you, if you had been wronged. Accordingly Sir <HI>William,</HI> about two Months ago, came to <HI>Easton,</HI> where, on the Proprietaries Commissioners producing and reading sundry Writings and Papers, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was convinced of his Error, and acknow∣ledged that he had been mistaken with Regard to the Charge of Forgery made against the Proprietaries, having been misinformed by his Ancestors, and desired that all further Disputes about Land should be buried under Ground, and never heard of more; offering that such of the <HI>Indians</HI> as were then present should sign a Release for the Land in Question, and that he would endeavour to persuade the rest of his Brethren who were concerned to do the same at this Treaty at <HI>Lancaster.</HI> Now, Brethren of <HI>Allegheny,</HI> as we are Face to Face, be plain, and tell whether you are satisfied with, and approve of, what was done at the last Treaty at <HI>Easton,</HI> and whether you lay any Claim to those Lands, that there may be no Room left for any future Dispute about it among our Children.</P>
<P><HI>A small Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which</HI> Beaver <HI>said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As to my own Part, I know nothing about the Lands upon the River <HI>Delaware;</HI> but since you request it, I will first speak to my own People about it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Beaver</HI> consulting with his Counsellors, returned the following Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I must acknowledge I know nothing about the Lands upon the <HI>Delaware,</HI> and I have no Concern with Lands upon that River. We know nothing of the <HI>Delawares</HI> Claim to them. I have no Claim myself, nor any of my People. I suppose there may be some Spots or Pieces of Land, in some Parts of the Province, that the <HI>Delawares</HI> claim; but neither I nor any of my People know any Thing of them. As to what you and our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> have done, if you are both pleased, I am pleased with it. As to my Part, I want to say nothing about Land Affairs; what I have at Heart, and what I came down about, is to confirm our Friendship, and make a lasting Peace, so as our Children and Grandchildren may live toge∣ther in everlasting Peace, after we are dead.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and his <HI>Delawares</HI> being present, something passed between them, which was not interpreted.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor, addressing himself to</HI> Beaver, <HI>said,</HI></P>
<P>I am very much pleased with what you have said; you speak like an honest Man, and I hope that the Friendship that has been made between us and our Brethren, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> will remain firm, as long as the Sun shines, and the Rivers run.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009412_0014_0F7404DC78C67838" MS="y"/>
Teedyuscung <HI>then stood up, and addressing himself to the Governor, said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Before all these <HI>Allegheny Indians</HI> here present, I do now assure you, that I am ready and willing to sign a Release to all the Lands we have been disputing about, as I told you I would at <HI>Easton,</HI> and desire no more may be ever said or heard of them hereafter.</P>
<P>On which the Governor told <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that he was pleased with what he had said, and that on that Occasion he had acted like an honest Man.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then concluded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your Brothers, the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, directed me, as soon as <HI>Teedyus∣cung</HI>'s Complaint against them was determined, and Justice done to their Characters, to make their old Friends, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> a Present, in their Name, to supply your Waists, and as a Mark of their Affection and Regard for you, and to convince you that they had no ill Will in their Hearts against you, but looked upon you as formerly to be their good Friends and Brothers. Now as that Dispute is happily at an End, I am at Liberty to follow their Directions, and shall accordingly order a Present of Goods to be delivered to you from the Proprietaries.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the Northern</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Lancaster, <HI>on</HI> Thurs∣day, <HI>the Nineteenth of</HI> August, 1762.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THOMAS KING, a Chief of the <HI>Oneidas,</HI> stood up, and spoke as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hearken to what I am going to say, in Answer to your Speech to me the Day before Ye∣sterday. I return you my Thanks; it gives me Pleasure that we see one another, in the same Manner as our Forefathers used to do.—Then taking up the Strings delivered by the Governor in their Order, he repeated what had been said upon them.</P>
<P>We are all very glad to see you, and your Brethren that are with you, in Health. All die <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and our Nephews, have had interpreted to them all that you said, and they are pleased with it, and very glad to see you, and that it has pleased the Great GOD, who has all Power in his Hands, to suffer us to come together, to speak to one another freely.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking another String, he repeated the Governor's Words spoke upon it; and, in the Name of all the <HI>Indians</HI> present, returned him Thanks for his taking the Briars out of their Legs, and healing the Bruises that were made in their Feet by the Stones.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The other Day you cleared my Ears, and my Cousins here, for which I return you Thanks; and now, by this String, I clear your Ears in the same Manner, thatyou may hear what I have to say to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told me the other Day, that as we were come from afar, and the Roads were very dusty, you cleansed our Throats from the Dust, and opened a Passage to our Hearts; we all return you Thanks that you have cleansed us so far, and we do in the same Manner clean your Throats and Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You likewise told me you wiped the Tears from my Eyes, for the Loss of my Friends, that we may see one another clearly, for which we all return you our Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is now three Years since you first demanded of us your Flesh and Blood. Now hear me, as to what I and all our Nations and our Allies, that live as far as the Sun-setting, have done.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009412_0015_0F7404DDD0A5B030"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I assure you, in Behalf of all of us present, and the Western <HI>Indians,</HI> of whom you have been demanding your Flesh and Blood, that I have them here, and that it is not my Fault, neither can I say our Maker has been the Cause, but the <HI>French</HI> have been the Cause why you have not had them sooner.</P>
<P>Then directing his Discourse to his Brothers and Cousins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> he proceeded, and said,</P>
<P>I never had Occasion to go to War with the <HI>English</HI> Nation; the People I had Occasion to go to War with live to the Southward; it has been so from all Ages, and we have always gone to War against the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> I never had Cause to go to War with the <HI>English,</HI> this was owing to the Evil Spirit, the Devil. When I used to go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> and brought Prisoners Home, I thought they were mine, and that no Body had any Right to meddle with them. Now since I joined with you, I went to War again, and I brought <HI>French</HI> People Home with me, as Prisoners, and you took them from me; this makes me think it was owing to the Evil Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you to be strong. I have heard you often say, you would be very glad if I would bring you the Captives, and you would make me Satisfaction, because you know I am not as you are; I am of a quite different Nature from you; sometimes I think you are not in Earnest with me, in telling me you will make me Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have heard you, and so have all my Brothers and Cousins to the Westward heard what you have said about giving us Satisfaction; your Words seem to be very sweet to us. You told us if we did so and so, you would do so with us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You know we are different Nations, and have different Ways. We could not immediately perform what you required of us, in returning your Flesh and Blood, because every one of these Nations have different Ways; that is the Reason why we could not so soon perform it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am sorry it is so difficult for us to understand each other: If we could understand one another, we would put one another in Mind of the Friendship that subsisted between us and our Forefathers; but as we do not easily understand one another, we are obliged to deliver you the Substance in short of what we have to say, which makes it tedious.—(Meaning that they are obliged to interpret in two or three Languages, before it is told to us.)</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have often told me, if I would bring your Flesh and Blood you would be very glad, and would give such Prisoners Liberty to return with them, if they did not incline to stay with you, and to go where they pleased.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being asked, who it was that promised the Prisoners should be left to their Choice, to return with them, or to go where they pleased? He answered, the Governor pro∣mised it at <HI>Easton,</HI> and there were two Governors there at that Time.—(Meaning Gover∣nor <HI>Denny,</HI> and Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have been requiring your Flesh and Blood these three Years; I promise you I will give you them, and now I will deliver all I have brought.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I am sorry we cannot speak to one another any faster, because we cannot understand one another without so many Interpreters, and this takes up much Time, so that we must be slow in telling our Business.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have told us, of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that we must assist you to see your Flesh and Blood. If we assist you, you say you shall see your Flesh and Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have done what we can, and that is the Reason why you see so many of your Flesh and Blood; some <HI>Indians</HI> part with them with Reluctance, and want to keep them longer;
<PB N="17" REF="009412_0016_0F7404DE8671F6A0" MS="y"/>they are unwilling to part with them, this brings a great deal of Trouble on us, the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have often told us, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that we should assist in getting your Flesh and Blood. I have done my Endeavour, and taken great Pains: I have got a great many of them, though at first with great Diffently: When I brought them by the <HI>English</HI> Forts, they took them away from me; all along from <HI>Oswego</HI> to the Carrying Place, and so to <HI>Niagara,</HI> till I got to <HI>Shamokin,</HI> they got them all from me, and I believe they have made Servants of them; This is the Reason why I brought so few of them: No Wonder they are so loath to come, when you make Servants of them. You know that you have told me that I should assist you, you cannot deny it: By and by you will say, I never told you to assist me, and that I tell Lies when I say so.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You told me you would be very glad if I would bring you your Flesh and Blood, and that you were able to make me Satisfaction for them: You said you had Rooms full of Goods, and that we should never want any Thing while you have Goods: You told me, we shall have a Recompence for our Trouble in bringing them down. I assure you, I have brought all your Flesh and Blood that I could get at this Time; there are some behind yet, but they belong to such People as are gone to War against the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> and we could not take them without their Leave, and when they return from War, we will certainly bring them.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have brought Fourteen of your Flesh and Blood, that is all I could get this Time; for as I told you, your People in the Forts have got them all away from me, they have stole them, or persuaded them to run away from me, and have hid them in the Bushes. As I told you, there are few left that belong to those <HI>Indians</HI> that are gone to War against the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> with whom we have been at War from all Ages, and they are at War with you; I assure you when they return, we will bring them all to you. You used to tell me, I always came una∣wares upon you, when I did come; you certainly knew that I was coming ever since last Spring, and you might have got every Thing ready for me. There is one Captive at the Camp that says he will not come, he says the Governor has seen him, and talked with him at the Camp; all the rest are here.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It may be there are two Governors of you; your Messages and your Words do not agree together; when I repeat what you have said to me, it seems disagreeable to you.</P>
<P>Here the Governor asked what he meant by two Governors, and desired him to explain himself, for he could not understand him.</P>
<P><HI>He answered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You want to know what my Meaning is, by saying there are two Governors. In every Country there is always one Head Governor, but here are two Governors. It will not do for me to point out People, for you must certainly know there is more than one Governor. I hear one say such a Thing, and another say such a Thing; but I will not point out any Body, lest you should differ. You will hear of it hereafter. I heard that both Governors came from <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> but perhaps I may be misinformed.</P>
<P>The Governor desired to know, whether any Messages had been delivered to them in their own Country, and by whom, and what the Messages were. He insisted on their giving him a plain Answer.</P>
<P>They answered, that the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> who were at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the Spring, brought the Messages to them; but do not pretend that they were delivered in the Governor's Name, but they might have brought what passed only in private Conversation.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>As I have now brought your Flesh and Blood, I would have you to take Care of them, and keep them fast. I brought a Girl to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and sthe run away: When I came Home, I found her there. Bless me! says I, there in my Wife. I was sorry that I had delivered her, but to my Surpries I found her at Home. You know it is hard to part with a Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have brought an <HI>English</HI> Prisoner, who I love as my own Wife: I have a young Child by her. You know it is very hard for a Man to part with his Wife. I have delivered her, therefore take Care of her, and keep her safe, that she dont make her Escape.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009412_0017_0F7404DEB6BC5440"/>
<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our Grandfathers used to tell us, we should keep fast Hold of the Chain of Friendship, and always advised us to observe it; but now, in latter Days, as soon as I came across the Hatchet, I got Hold of it, and really I did not know what I was about, and stuck it into your Heads. By this Belt, I take the Hatchet out of your Head; it belongs to you and the <HI>French;</HI> you are both of one Colour. It has been the Fault of the <HI>French</HI> that we struck you, and therefore we take the Hatchet out of your Head.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now that I have taken the Hatchet out of your Head, I gather your Bones, which lie seattered in so many Places, that I cannot name them particularly.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There is a large Pine Tree in the <HI>Oneida</HI> Country, which I take and pull up by the Roots, and then it makes a great Hole; when I look down the Hole, I see a great River, running very strong at the Bottom. By this Belt I gather all your Bones, wherever I can find them, and bury them in that Hole, and the Hatchet with them; when I put them down the Hole, they fall into that strong Stream, and float down it, I know not where. I stick that Pine Tree down again in the same Hole, and then no Body can discover that there has been a Hole; so that neither you nor I, nor our nor your Grandchildren, shall ever be able to know where your Bones are laid. This is the Custom of our Forefathers, that when any Difference arose between them and their Brethren, they buried it in this Manner.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I own you are my eldest Brother. The eldest Brother should always teach the youngest Brother, when they misbehave; I therefore desire when you see us misbehave, that you would tell us of it, and teach us better.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our late Differences have been the Cause why the Clouds have hung over our Heads, and made it dark. Now by this Belt I take away all the Clouds, that we may see the Sky clear, and the Sun rise and set. We Fourteen Nations, now present, tell you this.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I don't doubt but there is some Foulness come into your Heart, through your Throat. My Grandfathers used to tell me, that whenever we found our Brother's Heart and Throat to be foul, that they had left me the best Medicines, and desired me to put it to your Mouth, to drink as a Physic, and that it would cleanse their Throat and Heart, and pass quite through their Body down to the Ground; and, Brethren, by this String I bury it in the Ground, so that your Heart and Throat may be for ever clean. We Fourteen Nations tell you so.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have removed all the Filthiness from your Body, and since I have cleansed it out and in, I shall go about that good Work of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It was we of the <HI>Mohocks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Tuscararas,</HI> that first brought about the good Work of Peace.—He added, that the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and <HI>Oneidas</HI> were the eldest of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and both of a Height.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will acquaint you further, that I have more Brothers to the Westward, and that we are all Brothers down as far as to the Sun-set; my Friends are so many, that I cannot tell hove many they are.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will let you know, that though the <HI>Mohocks</HI> are the eldest, yet they are the furthest off to the Eastward: When they hear any Thing, they pass through the <HI>Oneidas</HI> to the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> where the Council Fire burns: Likewise, when the <HI>Senecas</HI> hear any Thing, they come to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> because they are next to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council; so that whenever they hear any Thing to the East or West, it is carried to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council. (Meaning, that when you shall send any Messages to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, they must be sent either to the <HI>Senecas</HI> or <HI>Mohocks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will mention our old Friendship; I will make it new again; I will brighten up our old Chain of Friendship. Our Grandfathers used to tell one another they had one Heart, and
<PB N="19" REF="009412_0018_0F7404E0D8C98CF0" MS="y"/>here it is; they both had Hold of it: They used to tell one another they had one Head, here it is. I tell you the same; you and we have one Head, and one Heart. We Fourteen Na∣tions tell you so.</P>
<P>They delivered a Belt of Nine Rows, representing the Figure of two Men in the Middle, with a Heart between them, and Six Diamonds on each Side; one of the Men represents the <HI>Indians,</HI> the other the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now we have renewed our old Friendship; I am a little afraid your Fire is almost out, it is not good; now I will take all that bad Fire away, and kindle it again, and make a good Fire of it; I will take good dry Wood, and kindle up the Fire afresh that our Grandfathers have made, and so make the Smoke rise up so very high, that all distant Nations shall see it, and thereby know that there is a Council Fire here. There was a good Fire at <HI>Easton;</HI> that was really a good Fire, for when I came to that good <HI>Easton</HI> Fire, I could have my Belly full of Victuals, and Plenty of Drink; but now I come here, I have little to eat; I am sure I have no other Drink than dirty Water, which almost choaks me.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What we have hitherto said, concerning Peace, has been concluded upon by our old Counsellors. We also desired our chief Warriors to be strong, and assist the old Counsellors; and desired, if any Thing should be wanting in the old Counsellors, they would assist them in it, in order that our Friendship may be lasting; for the Counsellors can do nothing, unless the Warriors should give their Consent to it. We Fourteen Nations tell you so.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt with Seven Rows, with Two Diamonds in it, representing the Counsellors and Warriors, united in Council together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our Friendship seems to go on very kindly. I will tell you one Thing, you are always longing after my Land, from the East to the West; you seem to be longing after it. Now I desire you will not covet it any more; you will serve me as you have done our Cousins, the <HI>Delawares;</HI> you have got all their Land from them; all the Land hereabouts belonged to them once, and you have got it all.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I desire you to go no further than <HI>Nixhisaqua</HI> (or <HI>Mohenoy</HI>) I desire you will settle no higher up, for if you keep pressing on me, you will push me out, for I shall have no Place to live on, nor hunt in, neither for me nor my Grandchildren; so I desire you will press no further. I desire another Thing, that you will not take it from me by Force: If you take this Land by Force, it will never go well with either of us. You may remember that GOD gave us this Land, and you some other; yet I have parted with some of it to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have desired me to assist you, in order to bring in your Flesh and Blood, which now you see I have done. You used to tell me, if I would bring in your Flesh and Blood, or assist you therein, you would satisfy those who brought them in these are mighty pleasing Words to me, and I hope you will do so. Some of our Warriors who are here have no Guns, and if you will bestow any on them, I desire they may be good. You are daily making Risles; I do not know what you do with them. When you gave me any Guns, you gave me yellow-stocked ones, that are worth nothing. I have asked you now four Times. At <HI>Easton</HI> you gave me only Gun-Locks: What think you could I do with them, without Stocks and Bar∣rels? I make no Guns. After I got the Gun-Locks, I joined myself with General <HI>Forbes,</HI> and went to War with him, as you ordered me, against the <HI>French;</HI> and as soon as I had done it, you still gave me only Gun-locks.</P>
<P><HI>A Bunch of Ten Strings, mostly black.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Having finished what I had to say to you, I am now going to speak to my Cousins. Please to hearken to what I shall say to them.</P>
<P>Then directing his Discourse to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> he spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Cousins,</HI></P>
<P>I could hardly get along. I heard such frightful News, that indeed I could not get along, if I had not had good Courage. <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> before I sat off from Home, I heard you should say, you would poison us all, so that we should not hold this Treaty. Thinks I to myself, I will come nevertheless; if I die, it will be well; I can die but once; so then I came along as far as <HI>Wyoming.</HI></P>
<P>My Cousins,</P>
<P>As soon as I came there, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> began to make his Complaints that he had no Fire, so says I, Cousin, there is certainly some Fire, for I made one here for the <HI>Shawanese,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="009412_0019_0F7404E188A10F88"/><HI>(Cacawasheca)</HI> and I made another Fire at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for <HI>Alammapis;</HI> another Fire I made at <HI>Wighalousin;</HI> another Fire I made at <HI>Diahoga.</HI> All those Fires are there yet. The Fire at <HI>Wighalousin</HI> is a good Fire, for I heard no bad Stories there; that Fire at <HI>Shamokin</HI> is not yet out; if any Body stirs it, it will soon blaze. I made the Fire at <HI>Wyoming</HI> for the <HI>Shawanese;</HI> perhaps they will still return to that Place. Then I came along as far as <HI>Harris</HI>'s Ferry; there I heard another Piece of bad News from <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> who said he had got a Sort of Poison that will give the <HI>Indians</HI> the Bloody Flux, and as soon as they come, he would give it to them, that they might get the Flux, and die along the Road as they go. But, notwith∣standing these Discouragements, I came along, and got here. I now suspect there is a Bag of Poison somewhere about this Camp, that will give us the Flux as we go Home; and I think it will be great Shame, if it should be so, because our <HI>English</HI> Brethren sent for us; and if any of us should die, it will appear to them as if they had lost so many of their own People, because it was they that sent for us.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> I must teach you better; I will correct you; you must not talk of such a Thing, for if any of us die, it will be said <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was the Cause of it; so you should not say such Things. By this Belt I make a Fire for <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> at <HI>Wyoming;</HI> I tell him to sit there by the Fire Side, and watch that Fire; but I dont give it to him, for our <HI>English</HI> Brethren cast an Eye upon that Land; therefore I say to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> watch that Fire, and if any White People come there, tell them to go away, for that Land belongs to your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> The <HI>Six Nations</HI> want to keep up that Fire, that they may hear from their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The Belt was given to <HI>Tipiscohan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then turning to the Governor, be said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to say at present, but I have more in my Heart, which I cannot speak now, having staid so long that I am quite fatigued.</P>
<P>The Governor then acquainted <HI>Thomas King,</HI> that he had been attentive to all he said, and that he thanked him for it, and when he had considered of it, would at a proper Time re∣turn him an Answer; but told him, that he had not yet delivered him the Prisoners, and as this was in improper Place, he desired a few <HI>Indians</HI> would take them to the Court-House, where he would receive them.</P>
<P>The Conference then broke up, and the Governor, his Council, and the Commissioners, went with some <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs to the Court-House, to receive the Prisoners; where being come, the Governor acquainted <HI>Thomas King,</HI> that he was now ready to receive the Prisoners from him, and that they need not be under any Apprehensions of being used ill, for that he would be kind to them, and treat them like Children, and restore them to their Parents and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Then they delivered to the Governor the Prisoners, as follow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Williams,</HI> a young Woman, delivered by <HI>Mussause,</HI> a <HI>Munsey Indian; Henry Williams,</HI> about Eighteen Years of Age, Brother to <HI>Elizabeth Williams,</HI> delivered by <HI>Conoy∣hocheratoquin,</HI> a <HI>Munsey; Peggy Dougherty,</HI> delivered by <HI>Eckgohson,</HI> a <HI>Munsey; Mary Tidd,</HI> and her Child, taken near <HI>Samuel Depui</HI>'s, by <HI>Eckgohson; Abigail Evan,</HI> and her Child, ta∣ken at <HI>Stony-Creek,</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> by <HI>Cowachsora,</HI> a <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>
<P>A Boy, by <HI>Meightong,</HI> a <HI>Munsey;</HI> a little Girl, by <HI>Eckgohson,</HI> a <HI>Munsey;</HI> a little Boy, by <HI>Pessewauck,</HI> a <HI>Munsey;</HI> a Boy, of about Fourteen Years, by <HI>Eckgohson,</HI> a <HI>Munsey;</HI> a Boy, of Twelve Years, by <HI>Cowockslaira,</HI> a <HI>Seneca;</HI> a little Boy, of Seven Years, by <HI>Corocksaara,</HI> a <HI>Seneca;</HI> a little Girl, of Six Years, by <HI>Contaronque,</HI> a <HI>Seneca.</HI> These Childrens Names un∣known, as they cannot speak <HI>English,</HI> or give any Account from whence they were taken.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>THE Governor opened the Conference, and spoke to the <HI>Indians</HI> as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>I told you, a few Days since, of the Disputes that had happened between your Brothers, the Proprietaries, and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> about Land; and that I had their Orders, as soon as that Dispute should be ended, and the Proprietaries Characters cleared, to make the <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> a Present of considerable Value, as a Mark of their Affection to their old Friends. To which Present from the Proprietaries, the good People of this Province have been pleased to make an Addition, of equal Value.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI> Teedyuscung <HI>and</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>As that Dispute is now happily settled, I do (in Consequence of the Proprietaries Orders, and upon what was agreed upon at <HI>Easton,</HI> upon that Subject, between me and your Friends, the People of this Province) make you a Present of the Goods and Money now lying before you, to be equally divided between you, as a Proof of the Regard, both of the Proprietaries and People, for their old Friends, the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>As this is the first Time we have seen you, and our Friends from the Westward, since the late Disturbances; and as some of them have been at Expence in collecting and bringing down our Flesh and Blood, which they have now delivered to us, I, and your Friends of this Province, have thought fit to make you this further Present, to testify the Pleasure we have in seeing you, after so long an Absence, and our Thankfulness for your having restored the Prisoners.—As you know better than we, in what Manner to divide the Present now made you, we desire you will do it amongst those who come with you, in the most just and equitable Manner, paying a particular Regard to those who have now, or at any other Time, been at Trouble and Expence in collecting and restoring our Flesh and Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>We have had frequent Opportunities of shaking you by the Hand, since the War, and you, upon many Occasions, received the strongest Proofs of our Reconciliation and Friendship for you. Nevertheless, as we observe that a greater Number than common of your Friends are come down with you, in order to enable you to shew your Kindness to them, we think fit to make you this additional Present.</P>
<P>And now, Brothers, I heartily wish the Peace and Friendship, which have been renewed betwixt us at this Treaty, may continue and grow stronger, as long as the Sun shall shine, or the Rivers run; to which you may be assured we, on our Parts, shall contribute to the utmost of our Power, as we doubt not you will also on yours.</P>
<P>After the Governor had finished his Speeches to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> the latter rose up, and addressing himself to <HI>Beaver,</HI> desired him to take Notice, that he now delivered up all his Right and Claim to the Lands on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> that have been in Dispute between him and the Proprietaries of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> and that he now, as he <HI>(Beaver)</HI> saw, received
<PB N="22" REF="009412_0021_0F7404E279038520"/>this Money and Goods from his Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> He further desired <HI>Beaver</HI> to acquaint all the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation have now no Right or Claim to any of the Lands on the Waters of the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> that have been in Dispute.</P>
<P><HI>Then turning to the Governor, said to him,</HI></P>
<P>Now Brother Governor, our Children and Grandchildren shall never be able to say here∣after, that they have any Right or Claim to the Lands that have been in Dispute upon that River.</P>
<P>The Governor, directing his Discourse to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> told them, that as they had now received a considerable Sum of Money, he cautioned them against giving too much of it to their young Men, who, instead of laying it out in Things necessary and useful, might be tempted to debauch themselves with strong Liquors, which might occasion them to quar∣rel, and do Mischief, not only to one another, but also to their Brethren, the <HI>English;</HI> which might endanger the Chain of Friendship betwixt them and us, and would be a very ungrate∣ful Return for all the Kindness we had shewn them.</P>
<P><HI>To which they both answered,</HI></P>
<P>That they were obliged to the Governor for his Advice, in which they thought he had their Good at Heart, and promised to follow it, and heartily thanked him for it.</P>
<P>The Governor then delivered to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> respectively, <HI>Two Hundred Pounds,</HI> in milled Dollars, and the Value of <HI>Four Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods, to be equally divided between them. He further presented to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and those who came with him from the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the Value of <HI>Four Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods; and the Value of <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and his Friends and People. And after taking them both by the Hand he departed, and the Conference ended.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the Northern</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Lancaster, <HI>on</HI> Mon∣day, <HI>the Twenty-third of</HI> August, 1762.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THOMAS KING stood up, and addressing himself to the Governor, spoke as fol∣lows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It is about three Years ago that you asked me, whether I was willing you should build a Fort at <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nokin;</HI> you said you wanted to build a Fort there, to stand against the <HI>French,</HI> and to defend the Inhabitants; that our Great King had commanded you to build Forts. You said you would keep a Fort there as long as the War continued, but that you did not want any of our Land there.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You likewise asked me to let you build a Fort there, to defend my Land, and to defend yourself; you told me, that you did not desire any greater Quantity of my Land than what the Fort took up. I granted you Liberty to build a Fort, because you told me it was the Great King GEORGE desired you might build one on my Land; and I endeavoured to assist you. You also told me, as soon as ever the Peace was concluded you would go away; or that at any Time when I should tell you to go away, you would go away, and that I might do what I would with the Fort.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now all the different Tribes of us present, desire that you will call your Soldiers away from <HI>Shamokin;</HI> for we have concluded a Peace, and are as one Brother, having one Head and one Heart.</P>
<P>If you take away your Soldiers, we desire you would keep your Trading House there, and have some honest Man in it, because our Cousins follow their Hunting there, and will want a Trade. This is the Way for us to live peaceably together.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I must tell you again, these Soldiers must go away from <HI>Shamokin</HI> Fort; I desire it, and let there be only Traders live there; you know who are the honest People; we desire that
<PB N="23" REF="009412_0022_0F7404E882E64388" MS="y"/>only honest People may live there, and that you will not be too hard with us, when they may buy our Skins and Furs, and such Things as we may have to sell. This will be the Way for us to live peaceably together; but for you to keep Soldiers there, is not the Way to live peaceable. Your Soldiers are very often unruly, and our Warriors are unruly, and when such get together they do not agree. For as you have now made Peace with all our Nations, there is no Occasion for Soldiers to live there any longer.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have all consulted, and concluded on this Matter of your removing the Soldiers from <HI>Shamokin;</HI> for you know we go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Cherokees;</HI> we have been at War with them ever since we were created, and the Place where the <HI>Shamokin</HI> Fort stands is right in our Warriors Path, and you know that Warriors are al∣ways an unruly People. For this Reason we desire you to take away your Soldiers, and place some honest Man there, that he may supply our Warriors with Ammunition, and any other Necessaries that they may want, when they go to War against the <HI>Cherokees.</HI> We must press you to take away your Soldiers from <HI>Shamokin,</HI> as our Warriors are unruly. You have planted Corn there, and if our Warriors come there, they may cut some of your Corn-stalks, and then you will be angry. The Fort you have there does not now do any Good, for you have many other Forts all around you; this one therefore can be of no Use to you; it stands as it were at your own Doors.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Twelve Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> He said he had forgot a Word in this Belt, which was to tell the Governor, that he might chuse and appoint such Men as pleased to trade, and also a Black-smith and Gun-smith, to mend their Guns and Hatchets, or do any Thing they may want.</P>
<P><HI>He then added,</HI></P>
<P>We desire that the present Store-keepers at <HI>Shamokin</HI> may be removed, and honest Men placed there in their Room; for our Hunters, who have been down there, complain that when <HI>Indians</HI> come there, and want Provisions and Goods, they find the Store sometimes shut up, and they cannot be supplied with what they want.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>For my Part, I think <HI>John Harris</HI> is the most suitable Man to keep Store; for he lives right in the Road where our Warriors pass, and he is very well known by all of us in our Nation; as his Father was before him; we all know him. If you chuse <HI>John Harris,</HI> we desire you will order him to keep Provisions and Cloaths, to give to our People, who some∣times come there naked; and likewise Ammunition for our Warriors, for that is their Path. We desire you may have no Trading Houses higher up the <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> than <HI>Shamokin;</HI> let the <HI>Indians</HI> come there, or to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s; if they want to trade, let them come down to these Trading Houses. We also desire you will send your Messages to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s, so that we may hear from one another, because where he lives the Road seems to divide, and spread, and it goes to many Places. And we further desire you will give him a Commission for these Things, in Writing.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being asked, if they meant that <HI>John Harris</HI> was to be furnished with Goods to sell or to give to the <HI>Indians?</HI> He answered, that they desired there might be a Trading House there, and that this was what they requested; and desiring to be excused, if they for∣got any Part of their Speeches, as they were very long.</P>
<P><HI>He proceeded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have now mentioned two Places for you to keep Store Houses at, <HI>Shamokin</HI> and <HI>John Harris</HI>'s; but perhaps they will sell at different Prices, and if we have a Mind to have Goods cheapest, we may go to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s. We therefore desire you will let us know, what Prices you set upon your Goods.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Ten Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will also acquaint you of another proper Trading Place, and who we think will be a suit∣able Man to keep that Store House, and that is <HI>George Croghan,</HI> who is very well known by all our Nations, and several others. We desire you will appoint him to keep Store at <HI>Bed∣ford,</HI> because that is also in our Warriors Path. We desire likewise, that there may be a Black-smith and Gun-smith, because my Cousins will be there a hunting, and will want their Things mended. This will be known every where, throughout all our Nations; for as the Peace is made, our young Men will set themselves to hunt, and bring Skins there, and will have nothing else to do but hunt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009412_0023_0F7404E3C0330298" MS="y"/>
<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will also acquaint you of another Trading Place, which is the Place they call <HI>Patowmack,</HI> in <HI>Maryland.</HI> One <HI>Dantel Cressap</HI> has sent me Word, by many Warriors, this Spring, and he tells me, that if the Governor would order him to keep a Store there, he would provide every Thing for the Warriors; for his Father used-to maintain all the <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors that passed and re-passed that Way. He likewise tells me, if the Governor would let him know what he thould do, and if he should be allowed to do this, he would provide for the War∣riors. We now desire, that he may be the Person appointed to receive Messages, and that you would acquaint the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> with this, that the Warriors may pass and re∣pass that Way, without any Molestation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We desire you to acquaint the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that we may pass and re-pass through his Province, when we go to War with the <HI>Cherokees;</HI> for our Warriors Road is stopped up in many Places; <HI>English</HI> People have settled on it. And now we desire that a Road may be opened, that we may pass safely. We desire nothing but Love and Friendship with our Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> as we pass through. We desire you will send a Letter, with this Belt, to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as from us, as soon as possible; for I do not know how soon my People may go that Way; our Warriors have already the Hatchet in their Hands, and perhaps they may go there before your Letter gets there; for which Reason I desire you will make Haste in this Business.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Five Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We now desire you to be strong, and that you will give us Powder; I do not think that you will refuse to let me have Powder, for you are able. Our Brother, General <HI>Johnson,</HI> though but a single Man, supplies all our People with Powder; when we go to see him, he fills all our Powder-horns with it. I see a great many of you here, and I think you are more able than he. Our own People at Home will have their Eye upon us, and expect that we shall bring them some Powder, and Presents; we therefore hope you will consider us in this, and make them larger than common, as we do not come to see you often.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I now speak in Behalf of our Warriors. When we heard your Words come to our Coun∣tries, they were very pleasing to us, that you would make Presents to your Brethren, when they come to see you, and would give them any Thing they might went. Now we desire you will give us some Vermilion, for you know that the eldest Brother has always Pity and Compassion on the youngest Brother; we know you are able, as you make all these Things in yourselves. We have all concluded Peace now, but we have given our young Men Liberty to go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> this is the Reason of our wanting the red Paint; you see the Warriors always paint themselves, when they go to War.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I shall now speak a few Words, without any Belt or String. Whenever the <HI>French</HI> were asked for Paint, or any Thing else, they always gave it to the <HI>Indians</HI> readily; and it is no Wonder that so many <HI>Indians</HI> liked the <HI>French,</HI> since they were so kind to them.</P>
<P>You see several of our <HI>Indians</HI> here dressed in <HI>French</HI> Cloaths; and we desire the Governor will be strong, and supply us with every Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have not lest any Thing in my Heart; I have said every Thing material I had to say; and now I desire you will help me as far as <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and supply me with Provisions; for perhaps some of our People, if they are hungry, may hurt some of the Inhabitants Corn or Fruit, and cause Differences to arise. When I came from <HI>Easton</HI> last, I had no Provisions given me to eat, so that when I got Home I was almost starved, and a mere Skeleton.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We want a little Lad that lives among you; he is <HI>Keisheta</HI>'s Son; the old Man ordered that he should live at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in order to learn <HI>English,</HI> to be an Interpreter; we think by this Time he has learned it, and we now think it Time for him to come Home; his Re∣lations, that are present, desire that he may go Home now with them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You may remember, three Years ago, that this Man (pointing to <HI>Samuel Curtiss</HI>) men∣tioned something to you about his Daughter, that was stolen from him in <HI>Dorset</HI> County, in
<PB N="25" REF="009412_0024_0F7404E4A2F07928" MS="y"/><HI>Maryland,</HI> about Fourteen Years ago. I spoke to you once before about it, and I have heard nothing from you concerning her.</P>
<P><HI>A black and white String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I am now going to speak to you in Behalf of <HI>Tokahaion</HI>'s two Daughters. They desire the Governor will give them a Horse; they hear the Governor is very kind, and gives many People Horses; they have two Plantations, at which they plant Com, and want Horses to carry their Corn, to ease their Backs, because when at Home, their Com Fieldsare at a con∣siderable Distance from them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Seneca George <HI>rose up, and spoke as follows,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, <HI>and all our Brethren with you,</HI></P>
<P>We all desire you to remember our Son, <HI>Robert White,</HI> who carries all our Messages; he is old, and we desire you will give him a Horse; you did give him a Mare before, but she is dead; she was with Foal, and died.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>then spoke as follows,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>This is all I have to say; I have nothing more in my Mind; I beg you will consider of all that I have said, and take Time to do it; it looks as if you were in Haste to go Home, but I desire you will be patient, and stay; I came a great Way, and will contentedly stay as long as may be convenient.</P>

<HEAD>TUESDAY, the Twenty-fourth of <HI>August.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THOMAS KING,</HI> in Behalf of the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> waited on the Gover∣nor, and acquainted him, that as their Speeches to him of Yesterday were long, he suspected he might have forgot something, and desired he would give him the Opportunity of hearing every Thing he had said repeated to them.</P>
<P>On which the Governor appointed a Meeting at the old <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church, at which were</P>
<P>PRESENT,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire,</HI> GOVERNOR, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>WILLIAM LOGAN, RICHARD PETERS, <HI>Esquires, of the Council;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>JOSEPH FOX, JAMES WRIGHT, SAMUEL RHOADS, <HI>Esquires, of the Assembly;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Thomas King, Tokahaion, Kinderuntie, <HI>and several other Chiefs of the</HI> Six Nations;</ITEM>
<ITEM>ANDREW MONTOUR, <HI>and</HI> ISAAC STILLE, <HI>Interpreters.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Indians</HI> were seated, the Governor, laying the several Belts and Strings in their Order, as delivered him Yesterday, directed the Secretary to read the Minutes, which were distinctly interpreted to them, Paragraph by Paragraph, and declared by the <HI>Indians</HI> to be right.</P>
<P><HI>After which</HI> Thomas King <HI>arose, and spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I mistook when I told you Yesterday, that I would have you keep a Store at <HI>Bedford;</HI> I meant that Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> should have a Store there, and that you should have the Care of the Stores at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and <HI>John Harris</HI>'s. As <HI>George Croghan</HI> is under Sir <HI>William John∣son,</HI> I wanted that he should appoint Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> to keep the Store at <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Tokahaion, <HI>a</HI> Cayuga <HI>Chief, spoke to the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>My Cousins, that live at <HI>Wighalousin,</HI> tell me, they went to the <HI>Easton</HI> Treaty to hear some∣thing about the Land Affair, between the Governor and <HI>Teedyuscung;</HI> these, my Cousins, went to the Governor, to enquire about their own Lands. The Governor made Answer to them, and told them, that he had bought their Land from their Uncles.—What they wanted to know about their Land is this, that if they found it was not sold by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> they
<PB N="26" REF="009412_0025_0F7404E50645D1D8"/>think they ought to be paid for it. And since my Cousins made this Complaint to the Governor, at <HI>Easton,</HI> they have asked me, whether I had sold the Land, or not. And I told them, that I did not know that I had sold any Lands belonging to my Cousins; but (speaking to the Governor) said, you know it, because you have Writings.</P>
<P><HI>He further added,</HI></P>
<P>You can tell whether you have bought the Land, or not; if it is not sold to you by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> it still belongs to them; but I do not want to sell Land, that you have already bought.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> having finished what they had to say, the Governor acquainted them, that <HI>Thomas</HI> King had promised him, the other Day, that they would deliver up all the Prisoners that were in their Camp, and that he understood some were there yet, and desired to know the Reason of their not being delivered up.</P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>Answered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge to have said, I would deliver up all the Prisoners, and I thought it had been done, and that all were delivered up that remained in the Camp; but we have gone too far, in engaging to deliver up all the Prisoners in the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, that belong to the absent Warriors. However, we suppose they will be delivered up, and we will do our Endeavours that it shall be so, and will consult with those that have the Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Kinderuntie, <HI>the</HI> Seneca <HI>Warrior, spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There are yet two White Men in the Camp; one of them, though he came with us, yet it was not by our Consent; he would follow us; he belongs to a Warrior, that is gone to War against the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> and we had no Right to bring him, without the Warrior's Con∣sent; you see him every Day; he is at Liberty. The other is a Deserter; he came among us of his own Accord; we informed Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> of it, and Sir <HI>William</HI> said, that perhaps he might have misbehaved, and that we might keep him; perhaps he might learn the Language, and be of Service as an Interpreter, and that he might stay with us, if he would; he did not come to us as a Prisoner, and as he has his Liberty, you may talk with him, if you please.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor made Answer,</HI></P>
<P>That as to the Captive, he expected they would deliver him up; and desired that they would bring the Deserter to him To-morrow Morning, that he might speak with him.</P>
<P><HI>To which</HI> Kinderuntie <HI>replied,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I cannot deliver up the Captive to you; he does not belong to me; he belongs, as I told you, to those that are gone to War; he came here of his own Accord; he followed me down, and if I should deliver him now, the Warriors would say that I had sold him, and that will make me ashamed; I therefore desire my Brother will not force me to deliver him at this Time, to make me ashamed. As to the Deserter, I will bring him to you at any Time.</P>
<P>The Governor concluded, by saying to them, that he would have them consider of this Matter in their Council again, and reflect seriously upon it, as he should have no Dependance on all they had already said, about restoring the Prisoners; unless they now delivered up this one to him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> then broke up, and went to their Camp.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day's proceedings">
<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the Northern</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Lancaster, <HI>on</HI> Thurs∣day, <HI>the Twenty-sixth of</HI> August, 1762.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor, first addressing himself to the <HI>Minisink</HI> Nation, spoke to them as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Minisink <HI>Nation,</HI></P>
<P>You have, since I saw you, lost a great Man. With this String I condole with you, and share your Grief on that Occasion; and with this Stroud I cover his Grave, and desire you may mourn for him no longer.</P>
<P><HI>A String and Stroud.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009412_0026_0F7404EA1C5C44E8" MS="y"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String I desire you may consult among yourselves, and appoint a Man to sit in Council in his Place, which will be agreeable to me.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor then, addressing himself to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> returned the following Answer to the several Speeches made by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> the <HI>Oneida</HI> Chief.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have, according to the antient Custom of your Ancestors, upon my bidding you wel∣come, and cleaning you, performed the usual Ceremonies on like Occasions; with which I am well pleased, and return you Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>A large String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, (Holding up the Belts and Strings that they gave)</HI></P>
<P>By these Belts you have made me several Speeches, respecting my requesting you to use your Influence with your Nephews, and all other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, to restore to us all our Flash and Blood. I make no Doubt you have met with some Difficulties on that Head, as I am very well acquainted with the Manner in which you carry on War against one another, and that what Prisoners you take, you claim an absolute Property in, by adopting them into your own Nation, as soon as they bring them Home.</P>
<P>But, Brethren, the Case is quite different between you and us. We do not look upon you to have the same Sort of Right over our Flesh and Blood, as over your own. As we are of a different Colour from you, so we have different Customs. It is a constant Rule with us White People, that upon making of a Peace with those with whom we have been at War, the Prisoners on both Sides are faithfully delivered up. Besides, you may remember it was a po∣sitive Engagement between us, upon re-establishing the antient Chain of Friendship that those Nations who had taken any of our People Prisoners, should deliver them all up; and this, Brethren, I must insist upon, as the only Means of burying every Thing that has passed be∣tween us. I thank you for the Influence you have used, and the Trouble you have taken, upon this Occasion; but we are informed, by such as have lately passed through the <HI>Indian</HI> Countries, that there yet remain a great many of our People, as Prisoners, in some of your Towns, particularly among our Brothers, the <HI>Senccas.</HI> It is, I suppose, as you fay, that some of them may belong to the Warriors, who are gone to War against the Southern <HI>In∣dians,</HI> with whom you are always at War; but whether they belong to them, or any other People, we expect that you will acquaint them with your repeated Engagements, that they shall all be delivered up, and therefore that they will no longer continue unwilling to part with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As to what you say about our Promises of paying you for our Flesh and Blood, you must have been mistaken; for I never either told you so, or sent you any such Message. If you have received any Messages to that Effect, they must have come from some other People. But I must be plain with you on this Subject, and tell you, that it is never our Custom to pur∣chase our Flesh and Blood of any Nation whatsoever. But, Brethren, what I have told you, and what I now again tell you, is this, that for any Services you may have done, with any of the Nations, on that Account, or for any Trouble or Expence they may be at, in bringing them down to me, I will make you and them a suitable Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Here gives three Belts, and a Bunch of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As to what you say about making Servants of our Prisoners, we are entirely ignorant of it; we do no such Thing, but as soon as we receive them from your Hands, we deliver them up to their Parents and Relations, if they happen to be present, and if not, we cloath them, and take Care of them, till we can get an Opportunity of sending them to their Friends. They are our own Flesh and Blood, and we use them as tenderly as is in our Power; if any have been treated otherwise, it is owing to your not delivering them to me. We have, indeed, at the Instance of some of your own People, put the Prisoners into the Court-House, till we could take their Names, and be informed of the Places of their Abode; and as soon as we were told this, they were all cloathed, and forthwith sent along, with some good Persons to take Care of them, to their Habitations; therefore do not entertain any Notion that we make Servants or Slaves of them, and when you return Home, let all your Nations know that this is truly the Case, and that the Prisoners are at Liberty to go to their Relations, as soon as they are delivered up to us; or, if they have no Relations, they go into such Places where they can best get Employment, in order to maintain themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I think it my Duty to tell you, that such of our White Men who want to stay with you, are either Deserters from the Army, or have behaved ill amongst us, and were they to stay with
<PB N="28" REF="009412_0027_0F7404E576F0B280" MS="y"/>you, they would be very apt to be very mischievous, and make ill Blood between us; we de∣sire therefore you will not encourage them, but deliver all such up as you have amongst you; and if you place any Dependance upon them, either in Peace or War, they will certainly de∣ceive you, as they have dene us.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It grieves me that any Occasion should have been administred to you, to observe to me, in so public a Manner, that there are others besides myself who concern themselves in Affairs of Government. If it be as you say, I must tell you, Brethren, that it is a great Presump∣tion, and an high Infringement of the Rights of Government, for any Person whatsoever, within this Province, except by my special Order or Commission, to send or deliver Messages to you, or to any other Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> or to treat with you, or them, on any public Matters. I am the only Person intrusted by His Majesty, and the Proprietaries, with the Administration of public Affairs within this Province; and I desire you to take Notice, that in order to prevent any Thing of this Kind for the future, all Messengers I shall send to you shall be furmthed with proper Credentials, and my Speeches in Writing, under the usual Seal; and if any Persons, <HI>Indians</HI> or others, should take upon them to deliver to you any Messages in my Name, unless they bring with them such Credentials as above mentioned, I desire you will pay no Regard to them, and acquaint me therewith.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You acquaint me, that your Grandfathers advised you never so have any Difference with your Brethren, the <HI>English.</HI> It had been well you had constantly taken their Advice, but as you say the Evil Spirit got the better of your Understandings, and compelled you to strike us, you, the other Day, by this Belt of Wampum, took the Hatchet out of my Head. It is pos∣sible, Brethren, that as you struck us, and obliged us to strike you, that you also have been hurt by us; I therefore, by this Belt, take the Hatchet out of your Heads.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt I join with you in collecting all our and your Bones, wheresoever scattered, and in burying them, with the Hatchet, and do heap up Earth about the Roots of the great Tree in the <HI>Oneida</HI> Country, where they and the Hatchet are buried; so that the Smell there∣of may never offend us hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me that I am your elder Brother, and whenever you misbehave, you desire me to give you Advice. Brethren, my real Regard to your Welfare, as we are Bre∣thren, will always induce me to take Notice of any Thing wrong that I shall observe in your Conduct; and by this Belt I stop your Ears against hearkening to any but myself.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I join with you in dispersing the dark Clouds that have gathered together, during our Dif∣ferences, and hid the Light from us, that we may see the Sky clearly, from Sun-rising to Sun-setting.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String of Wampum you tell me, that some Foulness may have got into my Heart, through my Throat, and that with a Medicine, left you by your Fathers, you make it pass quite through my Body to the Ground, and bury it there. As you may have contracted the like Foulness, by this String of Wampum I thoroughly purge your Body, and remove every Defilement.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You tell me, by this Belt, that there are only two Doors, the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Senecas,</HI> to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, one to the Westward, the other to the Eastward, through one of which all the Messages to that Council should properly come.</P>
<P>As I understand, by this Information, that you expect that this Method should always be observed by me, I shall very readily conform to it, and think it a very prudent Establishment of yours, for the Dispatch and regular Transaction of Business.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you take Notice, that our old Council Fire is almost out, and not good, and that you now put to it the same good dry Wood, such as your Ancestors used, and make it burn as bright as ever. You add further, that your Entertainment has not been as good here as at <HI>Easton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009412_0028_0F7404E7ABD5D128" MS="y"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I take it kind and friendly in you, that you have kindled up the old Fire; and by this Belt I heap up some good dry Wood, and join with you in putting it on the Council Fire, that it may burn as bright as ever. I am very sorry there should be any Cause of Complaint given you here, with Respect to your Accommodations; I took all the Pains in my Power that there should be none, and I hope now every Thing is made agreeable to you, with Respect to your good Accommodation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you acquaint me, that your Warriors have assisted the Counsellors in making firm the good Work of Peace, and that without their Concurrence and Assistance the Coun∣sellors can do nothing effectually.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gives me Pleasure to hear that your Warriors are united with you in Council, and are become unanimous in establishing the Peace, which has been so happily brought about. I am sensible of their Importance, and hope that the Harmony which now subsists may long continue; and I shall be ready to serve them, as well as you, as long as their future Conduct shall merit it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me, that the <HI>English</HI> have a longing Eye after your Land, and desire that we may not covet any more of your Land; and say further, that we have got all the Land belonging to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and shall serve you as we have done them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is true the <HI>Delawares</HI> had a large Tract of Land in this Province, bordering on the Ri∣ver <HI>Delaware,</HI> which the Proprietaries of this Province have, from Time to Time, fairly pur∣chased of them, and have honestly paid them for it, which they have acknowledged, in your Presence.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the same Belt you desire we will not think of making any more Purchase of Land, or settling your Lands by Force; for if we do, we shall push you back, and leave you no Land to live or hunt upon; and desire we would confine ourselves to <HI>Nixhisaqua,</HI> or <HI>Mohonoy,</HI> and settle no higher up.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> have never forced a Purchase of Lands from any of their Brethren, the <HI>Indians,</HI> since they have owned this Province. It is very well known, that the Native <HI>Indians</HI> very readily sold their Lands to the Proprietaries, as soon as he arrived here in their Country, about Eighty Years ago. And about Thirty Years ago the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> observing greater Numbers of White People than those old Purchases could accommodate, voluntarily sold to the present Proprietaries some Lands, lying further West. And their Number still increasing, at <HI>Albany,</HI> in the Year 1754, they sold them more Lands, as far as the Limits of the Province to the West, to be bounded by a Line agreed upon to the North∣ward.</P>
<P>And let me remind you of their Kindness to you, in this Respect; for no sooner were they informed that you repented of this last Sale, than they immediately gave Orders to their Agents here, to execute a Release to you for all the Lands over the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> which was accordingly done at <HI>Easton,</HI> in the Year 1758, in public Council; when a Draught of the Part of the Country, which the Proprietaries held, by the <HI>Six Nations</HI> Deed, on this Side the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> was shewn to, and approved by, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> some of whom are now present; and the Draught, and Copy of the Proprietary Release, were delivered in open Council to them, who returned their hearty Thanks to the Proprietaries for their Goodness. I hear those Chiefs put the Release and Draught into Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>'s Hands, and desired him to keep it for them, together with many other Deeds and Papers, at the same Time. Now, Brethren, as no Time has been fixed for the running of the North Line, or Boundary of this last Purchase, I desire you to apply to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> and whenever you and he shall think it necessary to run that Line, I shall always be ready to join with you; and until this be done, agreeable to your Deed, I shall not suffer any of my People to settle beyond it. By your Speech it appears to me, that you think the Line is fixed at <HI>Mohonoy;</HI> but by the Deed, which I have not brought with me, and so cannot now produce it, to the best of my Re∣membrance, the Line begins at a certain Mountain, by the River Side, about a Mile above
<PB N="30" REF="009412_0029_0F7404EAC420F220" MS="y"/>the Mouth of <HI>Mohonoy.</HI> I must therefore desire, that none of your People be permitted to disturb any Persons within the Limits of that Purchase, till that Line be settled.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to give some Guns, telling me that you had already made this Request four Times.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At the Conclusion of this Treaty I propose to make you a Present, Part of which will con∣sist of some good Guns, which I hope will please you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard attentively what you said to your Cousins, and to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> in particular. Among other Things you say, you formerly kindled a Fire at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for <HI>Allumapes;</HI> ano∣ther at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> for the <HI>Shawanese;</HI> and others at <HI>Wighalousin</HI> and <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oga.</HI> You say to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> cast an evil Eye on the Lands at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and that he is to watch that Fire, and if any White People come there, to tell them to go away; for that Land belongs to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Some of you may remember, that at the Treaty held last Year, at <HI>Easton,</HI> the <HI>Six Nations</HI> complained to me, that some <HI>English</HI> had settled upon their Lands, and desired me to assist them in preventing that Settlement, that they might not be wronged out of their Lands. They told me further, that they heard the Land had been sold; that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> never sold it, and that those who sold it stole it from them; that it was two <HI>Tuscaroras,</HI> one <HI>Oneida,</HI> and one <HI>Mohawk,</HI> who sold it, unknown to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> To this Request I answered, that a Number of People, from <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government, had settled at a Place on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> called <HI>Cushietunck,</HI> about Fifty Miles North of the <HI>Blue Hills,</HI> being the Settle∣ment complained of, and claimed all the Lands from thence quite up to <HI>Wyoming;</HI> that I had sent Messengers to them, to inform them that those Lands belonged to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and ordered them to remove away; but they resused to do it, assuring me, by the Messengers, that they had purchased all those Lands of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and under that Pretence had a Right to hold them.</P>
<P>As there are now many more of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> present than were at <HI>Easton</HI> last Year, I again request you to tell me plainly, whether these Strangers are settled there by your Con∣sent or not, and why no Measures have been taken, if, as some of you told me at <HI>Easton,</HI> the Lands were not sold by you, to oblige those private <HI>Indians,</HI> who stole the Land from you, to procure a Surrender of their unjust Deed, from the People to whom they have made it, that it might be brought into the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, and there cancelled or destroyed.</P>
<P><HI>Upon which</HI> Thomas King, <HI>without consulting any of the other Chiefs, rose up and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is very well known that the Land was solo by the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> some are here now that sold that Land; it was sold for <HI>Two Thousand Dollars,</HI> but it was not sold by our Consent in public Council; it was as it were stolen from us. Some People said that my Name was to it, on which I went down immediately to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to see whether it was or not, and found it was not. I brought a Paper back from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which I shall shew to the Governor. Had I not gone down to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the Lands would have been all settled up to <HI>Wyoming,</HI> as sar as <HI>Awicka,</HI> Twelve Miles on this Side <HI>Chenango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being then asked, whether those Lands at <HI>Cushietunck</HI> were a Part of those Lands that were stolen from them? He answered, they had nothing to do with them; they belonged to the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Governor asked, whether the Lands above the Hills, and at <HI>Cushietunck</HI> in par∣ticular, belonged to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> or to the <HI>Delawares?</HI> this was asked of all the <HI>Six Na∣tions</HI> present, and the Governor desired they would all give an Answer to it, <HI>Thomas King</HI> hav∣ing already said that those Lands belonged to the <HI>Delawares.</HI> They answered, that they would take it into Council, and give him an Answer in Writing.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Conference broke up for the present.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Lancaster, <HI>on</HI> Friday, <HI>the Twenty∣seventh of</HI> August, 1762.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>Esquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor continuing his Speeches to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String I inform you, that a few Days since your Cousins, the Western <HI>Indians,</HI> ap∣plied to me about our Trade with them, and told me that we sold our Goods very dear, and desired we would sell them cheaper; on which I informed them that I had, for their Benefit, opened a large Store of Goods at <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> and had appointed honest Men there to deal justly with them, and made no Doubt but they had done so; but that our Land Carriage was so long, and made the Expences so very high, that we lost Money by the Trade every Year; and that I know of no other Method, by which we could supply them cheaper, than by your suffering us to go up the Western Branch of the <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> River, with Boats or Canoes, and to build some small Store Houses, to put our Goods and Skins in, as we went up and came down that River. This Liberty I told them I would apply to you for, and I now desire you will be free, and tell me whether you will consent that we should build such Store Houses there, being un∣willing to do any Thing of that Kind, without having first obtained your Approbation, or to give you the least Reason to think we intend to settle any of the Lands there.</P>
<P>If you approve of this Proposal, I will send proper Persons to view that River, and to see how far Boats or Canoes can go up it; and I desire the People I shall send upon that Service may be under your Protection, and treated as your Friends, by any of your People they may happen to meet with in their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Kinderuntie, <HI>the head Warrior of the</HI> Seneca <HI>Nation, suddenly rose up, and spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have laid out two Roads already; one you told me was a good one, the other leads from <HI>Potowmack,</HI> and now you want another Road to go by Water; we cannot grant it to you, because our chief old Men are not here; we are chiefly Warriors here; I am almost as chief a Man as any among them, but we cannot grant it to you, because our chief Men are not present, and the Matter has not been consulted in Council. I give you this Answer now, because I have the Care of those Lands; but if it is agreed upon in our Council, that will be another Thing; but at present we deny you entirely.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember you told me, when you was going to <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> you would build a Fort against the <HI>French;</HI> and you told me that you wanted none of our Lands; our Cousins know this, and that you promised to go away as soon as you drove the <HI>French</HI> away, and yet you stay there, and build Houses, and make it stronger and stronger every Day; for this Reason we entirely deny your Request; you shall not have a Road this Way.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which the Governor answered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This Request did not arise from me; I only mentioned it, in order to oblige your Cousins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> who defired a Trade with us, and I did it that they might have their Goods cheaper; but this is an indifferent Matter to me; it particularly concerns your Cousins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and the Western <HI>Indians;</HI> and since the <HI>Six Nations</HI> disapprove of our going up and down the West Branch, and building Store Houses there, I shall say nothing further up∣on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>To which the</HI> Seneca <HI>Chief made Answer,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to hear you, as you say it did not come from you, but that it came from our Cousins; I thought it had been your own Proposal. I really quite wonder at my Cousins, that they did not tell me this; but since they have swallowed up all their own Land, and live to the Westward, I believe they are growing proud. The Lands do belong to me where they live; I conquered it with my Sword; but they are grown proud, and will, I suppose, not own us for their Uncles.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="009412_0031_0F7404EC37985878"/>
The Governor answered, that if he expressed himself in such a Manner to them, as if the Application did come from himself, he was mistaken; for that he meant to express himself, that he did it in Consequence of the <HI>Delawares</HI> desiring a Trade with us, and that our Goods might come cheaper to them, and that he knew of no other Method of rendering them so, but by Means of a Water Carriage; and therefore he told the <HI>Delawares</HI> that he would apply to their Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for Liberty to carry our Goods up the West Branch of <HI>Sas∣quehannah;</HI> and he desired that they should not think the <HI>Delawares</HI> in Fault, on this Account, as they did not propose this Method to him; and that no Blame should be imputed to them at all in this Affair; and that as he found it disagreeable to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> he would say nothing further about it.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then proceeded to speak to the</HI> Six Nations <HI>at follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you desired, that as there was no War now between you and us, and the Fort at <HI>Shamokin</HI> stood upon your Warriors Path, the Soldiers might be removed from that Garri∣son; but that the Trading House might still continue, that your Hunter and Warriors might be supplied with Goods; and further desired to know what Prices we set upon our Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You must be sensible, that though an End be happily put to the Was between the <HI>Indians</HI> and us, yet it still continues as warm as ever between as and the <HI>French,</HI> and therefore with∣out His Majesty's express Orders, at whose Instance you acknowledge it was built, by your own Consent, I cannot remove the Soldiers from that Garrison. I shall give particular Di∣rections to the Commanding Officer, that the Soldiers behave very well, both to your War∣riors and Hunters, when they come there; and if the Waniors behave well on their Parts, and keep sober, there can be no Differences between them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You further desire, by this Belt, that the Person who has the Care of the Provincial Store may be removed, and an honest Man put in his Place.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Agent at <HI>Shamokin</HI> has, so far as I know, supported the Character of an honest Man; but as it seems he is not agreeable to you, I will consult with the Gentlemen who are joined with me in the Direction of that Store House, when I return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and give you an Answer at a proper Time.</P>
<P>As to the Trading House, it shall continue, for your Convenience and Accommodation; but it is not in my Power to fix any certain Price upon our Goods. You know we don't make the Goods ourselves; they are made in <HI>England,</HI> and the transporting them over the Seas is dangerous in War Time, and very expensive, so that they must come much dearer now than in Time of Peace, and their Prices change, as the Risque and Demand for them is greater or less; but I am told, that they are sold to you as cheap as they can be afforded, and cheaper than they can be purchased from private Traders, and Care will be taken that they be good in their Quality.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you give it as your Opinion, that <HI>John Harris's</HI> House, standing on your War∣riors Path, would be a good Place for a Trading House, for the Accommodation of your Warriors and Hunters, and desire one may be erected there, and recommend <HI>John Harris</HI> to be Store-keeper.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the Relation you gave me at <HI>Easton,</HI> in 1758, when you was relating the Causes of the War, it appears that you were of Opinion, one of the principal Reasons which made you join the <HI>French</HI> against us, was owing in a great Measure to the ill Treatment your Warriors met with in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in those Places where your War Path passes through the settled Part of that Colony; and you have now desired me to write to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that as there are Settlers on your War Path, whereby it is stopped, he would cause it to be opened.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, I must acquaint you, that all the Way from <HI>Harris's</HI> Ferry to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the White People are settled very thick, so that should your Warriors now use that Path, fre∣quent Differences between them and the Inhabitants might probably arise, by means whereof, the Peace so lately established between us may be endangered. And I must desire you, for
<PB N="33" REF="009412_0032_0F7404EE6850C148"/>this Reason, to use your best Interest with your Warriors, in case they are determined to go to War, that they would pursue the old War Path from <HI>Shamokin,</HI> which lies along the Foot of the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> and which is the nearest Way they can go to their Enemies Country.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you tell me you intend to apply immediately to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to give Orders that the Warriors be supplied with Necessaries, through Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> at <HI>Rays-Town,</HI> I must refer you to him, that the same may be done in other of the King's Garrisons, along the War Path.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>John Harris's</HI> House is a great Deal out of the Way, if more Trading Houses shall hereafter be thought necessary than there are at present, which we shall consider of, we shall take Care to six them at the most convenient Places, for the Accommodation of our <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, and appoint honest Men to take the Direction of the Trade, who will deal justly and kindly with all the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you desire a Trading House may be erected on <HI>Potowmack,</HI> at <HI>Daniel Cressip's</HI> House, and that he may have the Care of it, for the Supply of your Warriors, and that I will send your Request to the Governor of <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your Belt, and all you have said upon it, shall be carefully sent to Governor <HI>Sharpe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I shall also, agreeable to your Request, transmit your Belt, and what you have said upon it, to the Governor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> and I shall lose no Time in doing it, as your Warriors, you tell me, are now ready to set out.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Some red Paint, or Vermilion, is provided for you, and it shall be delivered to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to your Request, the Persons whom I shall appoint to attend you, on your Re∣turn Home, will have Orders to surnish you with Provisions, as far as <HI>Shamokin.</HI> I have re∣ceived several Complaints of great Mischief being done by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their coming here, and therefore must insist upon it that you restrain your young Men from committing any fur∣ther Violence, or from taking any Thing from the Inhabitants in their Return; for this must have a natural Tendency to raise ill Blood in the Minds of the People.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The little Boy, <HI>Kisheta's</HI> Son, is, I hope, on his Way here, having sent for him to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

<P>Since you spoke to me, I am told <HI>Samuel Curtis</HI> is informed where his Daughter is, and if he pleases to go and see her, and desires my Passports, he shall be furnished with them.</P>

<P>A Horse shall be delivered to <HI>Tokabaion,</HI> for the Use of his two Daughters.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>A Horse will likewise be given to <HI>Robert White,</HI> in Lieu of the one that died,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As to the Application made by your Friends at <HI>Wighalousin,</HI> with respect to Lands they lay Claim to beyond the Mountains, I am surprized this should be mentioned to me by <HI>Tokabaion,</HI> after what passed at <HI>Easton,</HI> In the Year 1758, between me and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> respecting those Lands. Their Deed to the Proprietaries for those Lands was then produced, and was acknowledged to have been executed by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> some of whom were then present. They further added, that they had sold the Land in Question, and were honestly paid for it, and that the Land was theirs, and they would justify it; these were their Expressions. This being the Cafe, and we being unacquainted with any Rights they have, must refer them to you, and desire you will settle this Matter among yourselves.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me, that your Grandfathers advised you to keep fast Hold of the Chain of Friendship, and that you, the <HI>Mohawks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Tus∣caroras,</HI> have brought about the Peace; that you have more Brothers, Friends and Allies to the Westward, as far as the Sun sets, so many that you cannot tell their Numbers; and in Behalf of them and yourselves, who now make up fourteen Nations, you make our old Friendship new again, and brighten the Covenant Chain.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You know that when the Peace was concluded first between us, at <HI>Easton,</HI> as well as in several friendly Conferences held afterwards, we both of us took great Pains to send the Peace Belt among all your Nations, and among your Friends and Allies, to the most distant Parts; and we have heard you say with Pleasure, and we have ourselves likewise received Messages from several <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, that they were glad to hear we had made Peace together, and joined heartily in it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We thank you for renewing your old Friendship; we very heartily join with you in it, and in brightening the Covenant Chain, and confirm our Words with this Belt. When you re∣turn Home, we desire you will shew this Belt to your own People, and to all the Nations in your Alliance, and let them know how friendly your Brothers have received you; advise them not to hearken to any Stories that bad People may tell them, to our Prejudice; desire them to stop their Ears to all such Stories, and assure them that we shall, on all Occasions, preserve our Friendship with our <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, and their Allies. And we hope, that both you and we shall be so careful as not to give the least Occasion of Difference, so long as the World lasts.</P>
<P><HI>A very large Peace Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As I have now finished all my Business with you, I inform you, that as the good People of this Province think you may want some Cloathing, and other Necessaries, they have, from the Regard they have for you, put into my Hands a confiderable Present of Goods, which I shall deliver to such Persons as you shall appoint to receive and divide them; and I defire, that in the dividing them you will pay particular Regard, and give an handsome Present to such <HI>Indians</HI> who have been at any Expence and Trouble in bringing down the Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> desired that the Governor would stay a little longer, for that they had some∣thing further to say to him.</P>
<P><HI>Then the</HI> Onondagoe <HI>Chief,</HI> Deogwanda, <HI>rose up, and addressing himself to the Governor, said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I mentioned to you, the other Day, my Desire that there should be a Store House kept at <HI>John Harris's,</HI> and that he might have the Care of the Store for the Warriors. I desired, at the same Time, that the Road might be opened for the Warriors, to pass through the back Settlements to the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> you know we are, and always have been at War with them, and I shall now begin to strike them. You told me, in Answer, that you thought it best that that Road should be stopt up, left any Differences should arise between your People and our Warriors; and desired, if any Warriors did go to War, they would take the old Road that led to the Southward, under the Mountains; and I now tell you, that as you desired that Road should be stopt, it shall be so, and I will take the old Road. We don't now desire a Store House should be kept at <HI>John Harris's</HI> for the Warriors, but that he may be supplied with Provisions, and other Necessaries, for our Chiefs and old Men, as they pass to and fro about the good Work of Peace. We know <HI>John Harris,</HI> and he is known among all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, and we desire he may be the Man appointed for the Care of this Matter</P>

<P><HI>KINDERUNTIE,</HI> in Company with some other <HI>Six Nation Indians,</HI> having, agreea∣ble to the Governor's Desire, brought <HI>Peter Weese,</HI> one of the Captives, mentioned to him in the old <HI>Lutberan</HI> Church; the Governor took <HI>Peter</HI> into a private Room from the
<PB N="35" REF="009412_0034_0F7404EF3955A878"/><HI>Indians,</HI> to confer with him respecting his Inclination to stay among the <HI>Indians,</HI> left he should be under any Fear of speaking his Mind freely in their Presence; when, after a free Conference, <HI>Peter</HI> desired he might not now be detained among the White People, but left to his Liberty to return with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that on his Way he would call on his Brother, who lived near <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> and speak with him, and return to the Governor in the Spring, and gave several Reasons for his staying with them this Winter. On which the Governor consented to his Request, and went with him to the <HI>Indians;</HI> and then acquainted the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs present, that as he had now consented that the Prisoner, <HI>Peter Weese,</HI> should stay among them, agreeable to his Inclination, and their Desire, he hoped they would be as honourable, on their Part, in delivering up the other Prisoner, who was a Deserter from the Army, and now in their Camp; and that they would do every Thing in their Power, on their Return to their own Country, to collect every Prisoner among them, and deliver them up faithfully, agreeable to their Promises.</P>
<P>Kinderuntie <HI>answered,</HI></P>
<P>That he was well pleased with what the Covernor had done; that he would now deliver up the Deserter to him, and that he should make it his particular Business, when he returned Home, to make a thorough Search every where in their Towns for all the Prisoners that are among them; that the Governor might rely upon these Endeavours, and that as soon as he had done this he would faithfully deliver them all up, and use his Interest with all others to do the same.</P>
<P>The Deserter was brought soon after to the Governor, who assured him of his receiving him with Kindness, and he would grant him his Protection, if he would consent to come among the <HI>English.</HI> He answered, that as he consided in the Governor's Assurances, he was very willing to return among the <HI>English</HI> again, and it he would grant him a Pass, he would go down into <HI>Maryland</HI> to his Parents and Relations there.</P>
<P>Kinderuntie <HI>then said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As both you and we are in a great Hurry to have the Business of the Treaty finished, that we may all return Home, I shall not detain you; and shall only at this Time request you to grant to <HI>Totiniontonah</HI> a Rifle Gun, of your own Make, and a Saddle for my Friend, this young Man here.</P>

<P>The Governor said, he would consider of what they said, and return them an Answer To∣morrow Morning; and should be glad at that Time to see all the chief Men of the <HI>Six Na∣tions,</HI> that he might deliver them the Presents, and take his Leave of them, as it is now growing late.</P>

<P>EARLY in the Morning <HI>Deogwanda</HI> and <HI>Kinderuntie</HI> waited on the Governor, at his Lodgings, and told him, that they had agreed in Council not to say any Thing further about Lands; but would take what the Governor had said to them on <HI>Thursday,</HI> respecting the Lands above the Hills, and at <HI>Cushictunck,</HI> and also what he said the next Day, respecting the Lands claimed by the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> at <HI>Wighalousin,</HI> to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, to be there considered.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>Who complain against <HI>Nathaniel Holland,</HI> at <HI>Fort-Augusta,</HI> as a Man who always treats the <HI>Indians</HI> who come there with ill Usage, and bad Language, insomuch that they are very often so provoked as to do him Violence; and as the public Business is now over, they intreat the Governor to remove him, and put a more quiet Man in his Place. They further say, that as the Governor has acquainted them that the War has occasioned a Rise in the Price of Goods, they hope the Governor will give Orders that they may be paid a higher Price for their Skins and Furs in Proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009412_0035_0F7404E93A147050"/>
The Governor made Answer, that he would take this Matter into Consideration, and do in it whatever was thought reasonable; and further acquainted them, that the small Presents they had requested of him the Day before should be granted them.</P>
