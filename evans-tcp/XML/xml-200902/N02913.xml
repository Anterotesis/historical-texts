<HEAD>A PREFACE To the Reader</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU have here another Attempt to confute the great Errors of the Peo∣ple called <HI>Quakers,</HI> wherein, I think, sufficient is said to make it appear to any serious and considerate Person, <HI>That that People are not led by the Spirit of Christ,</HI> because they do so plainly, and it must be added so prophanly deny the <HI>Com∣mands</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="003489_0004_0FF84C420C68C5E8"/>I. They deny that <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> in the outward Elements of them, <HI>Water, Bread and Wine,</HI> are Christ's Com∣mands: And yet it is here made plain and Evident from the express Words of Christ and his Apostles.</P>
<P N="1">1. With Respect to Baptism, that Water and the Spirit are joyned together, and both made necessary to our Regeneration: And what Christ has joyned together, <HI>Joh. iii 5.</HI> let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man presume to put assunder.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the Apostles understood outward Water to be commanded, by their actu∣al using of it, as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Phillip</HI> did, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> allow, and yet pretend it is not necessary: Do they think, that the Apostles would have used Water, if they had not thought it necessary? Would they have pre∣sumed to do it, if they had not been assured it was the Mind and Will of their Master, that it should be done.</P>
<P>And as Christ joyned Water and the Spirit <HI>Joh. iii 5.</HI> to St. <HI>Paul</HI> joyns <HI>The Washing of
<PB N="iii" REF="003489_0005_0FF84C44E1CA9AB0"/>Regeneration</HI> with <HI>The Renewing of the ho∣ly Ghost, Tit. iii 5.</HI> which must mean Wash∣ing with Water in Baptism, joyned with the Sanctificaticn of the Spirit; For to say that by <HI>Water</HI> and the <HI>Washing of Regeneration</HI> is meant the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Renewing of the holy Ghost,</HI> where the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>holy Ghost</HI> are mentioned at the same Time, is to make Christ and his Apostles speak Nonsence; for it makes them say, <HI>We must be born of the Spirit, and of the Spirit: We must be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and by the holy Ghost:</HI> Which is ridiculous. The Quakers therefore are very Prophane in making Christ and his Apostles speak Nonsence, and in separating what they have joyned together, and in making that needless which Christ has made necessary, who so evidently required both <HI>Wa∣ter</HI> and the <HI>Spirtt.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. With Respect to the Lord's Supper, no∣thing can he plainer, than that we are requir∣ed to <HI>Eat Bread</HI> and <HI>Drink Wine,</HI> in <HI>Re∣membrance of Christ's Death, litereally</HI> as well as <HI>spiritually:</HI> For the Quakers them∣selves don't deny but that Christ administred
<PB N="iv" REF="003489_0006_0FF84C4736441AE8"/>the outward Elements: And it is clear, that be commanded expressly saying. <HI>Do this in Remembrance of me,</HI> Luk. xxii 19. Yet the Quakers reject this Command of Christ, and will not do it in Remembrance of him. They allow that St. <HI>Paul</HI> meant outward <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> whereby we are <HI>to shew forth Christ's Death till he come,</HI> and then ridi∣culously pretend he was not yet come spiritual∣ly, though he had long before sent his holy Spi∣rit to 'em: And on the other Hand they say, he is now long since come, though that Text evidently means his coming to <HI>Judgment,</HI> and can be meant of nothing else, since he was long before that come both personally and spiritually: Yet they, I doubt willfully, shut their Eves and say they will not shew forth the Lord's Death by that outward Ordinance.</P>
<P>Thus Water Baptism and the Supper of Bread and Wine are as plainly required as Words can make them; and I defy the <HI>Quakers</HI> to shew in what Words, they could have been more plainly expressed, if it had been Christ's Design to command them.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003489_0007_0FF84C48CB833848"/>In short, I think it must be very plain to any unprejudiced Person, that by the same Method of Interpreting Scripture as they use against Water Baptism, and Bread and Wine, they may Interpret away all the Doctrines of Christ, and even his own Humane Nature of Flesh and Flood it self, and may say that it was all only spiritual, and there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne but a Christ with∣in, and that be only <HI>died spiritually,</HI> as that Baptism and the Lord's Supper are only spiritu∣al: and thus indeed <HI>George Fox,</HI> their origi∣nal Teacher first taught. And then where is Christianity? It is all Delusion and nothing but parable and Allegory; but dreadfull delusions these are. Let therefore every serious Person beware of the fatal Tendency of these Doctrines that deny the literal Meaning of these plain Commands of Christ, of Water Baptism and Bread and Wine. for,</P>
<P N="2">II. It is plain that since they deny these express Commands of Christ, what ever they pretend they are not led by the Spirit of Christ;for his Spirit would teach them, that they are his Laws and that they must be Obedient to them, if they would be saved: Instead of which they make a mere Mock of them.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="003489_0008_0FF84C4AF82BAF38"/>Let therefore the people of God diligently read what is here offered, and take care not to be deceived by these Seducers, who would tempt them to deny their Baptism, and consequently to deny Christ by denying his sacred Laws and Institutions.</P>
<P><HI>I conclude with the Last Words of St.</HI> Paul <HI>in his second Epistle,</HI> Ye therefore Beloved, seeing ye know these things, beware lest ye also being led away with the Error of the Wicked fall from your own Stedfastness: But grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and saviour Jesus christ: to him be Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now and for ever, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y solicitous Concern for the Honour of Christ's Institution, and the Safety of those Souls committed to my Charge, has indu∣ced me to appear publickly, in Oppositi∣on to the Attempts of those wicked Sedu∣cers that labour by all possible Means to propagate their poisonous Errors, and influence Men to neglect, despise and contemn those sacred Rites of Reli∣gion, that have always been treated with the greatest Re∣verence and Respect by the Church of Christ, yea, by all Christians all the World over, and looked upon, not only as the Ordinances of Christ himself, but also as necessary Means of our Salvation and Happiness, and the proper Instruments of conveving to us the Grace and Comforts of God's holy Spirit; of which holy Ordinances the sacred Scriptures speak with no less Honour and Reverence:</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="003489_0010_0FF84C4EAF0E3420"/>And yet these in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated Enthusiasts (I mean the Quakers) shew the same Zeal and E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnestne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in decr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing these sa∣cred Observations as if they were right down Idolatry, and giving Adoration to Stocks and Stones.</P>
<P>MY first Letter was wrote to one of my Flock, sedu∣ced by them, desig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with all Tenderness and Compassion to represent the dangerous Sna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e she was drawn into; to which I received two Answers (such as they were) from the Quakers, before I put that Letter in Print. The first was from <HI>James Mott,</HI> to which I wrote a large Re∣ply, and sent it in Manuscript, of which they have tak∣en no Notice. But <HI>Edward Bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> sends me an Answer to the first Letter, to which also I have reply'd by Way of Apendix to my Reply to <HI>James Mott,</HI> and proposed the Printing of both together, as soon;as their Answers appeared; but instead of Printing the Answer to which I sent a Reply in Manuscript, they have hamered out a new Answer, which is the third to my first Letter, and take no Notice of that Reply This Answer of <HI>Mott</HI> now in Print, however silly and Contemptible, is migh∣tily magnified among their Zealots, and by that Means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>museth some ignorant People, which has induced me to write the following Dialogues, to give a short Representation of the Wicked Principles and Practices of the Quakers. Wherein also I have represented the Pleas for their Justification as fairly and fully, as I believe they would have done themselves; and have taken in, I think, a full reply to <HI>Mott</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rling</HI> both: I don't meant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery particular Paragraph, but to the Drift and Substance of their Answers. I have not so much insisted upon the Previledges and Benefits of Baptism in these D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s because I had considered these in my Letter, and from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justly inferred, that the Qua∣kers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Gospel than what the Apostles preached and therefore are under St, <HI>Paul's</HI> Anathema. And all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was necessary to establish this consequence, was to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appear, That the Baptism Christ institu∣ted,
<PB N="ix" REF="003489_0011_0FF84C522DC7C5B8"/> is with Water, and not what the Quakers pretend to hold to; which I think I have here done ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tually</P>
<P>I HAVE taken no Notice of <HI>James Mott's</HI> Expositi∣on of 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii 21. because I saw no Argument in it; but am since told, that Paragraph is reckoned by 'em the finest flower in his Book; and therefore I will offer a Word or two upon it in this Place. St. <HI>Peter</HI> says, v. 20. — <HI>Fight Souls were saved by Water. v.</HI> 21. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike Figure whereunto Baptism doth now save us. James Mott says, The Water of Noah's Flood was sent to destroy, and not to save. That it was the Ark that was saving, and the Water destroy∣ing.</HI> I refer to his Book, without reciting the whole Passage, p. 11, 12. From whence I conclude he would infer, that what <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family were saved by, was no Type of Water Baptism, because the Type was not <HI>Water,</HI> but <HI>the Ark.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if <HI>James</HI> had been a very little learned in the <HI>Greek,</HI> he might have found out that nothing in all that 15 <HI>vers</HI> could be pitched upon for the Type but the Wa∣ter, of which Baptism is expressly called the Antitype, for in the Original it is <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Omega</NOTE> <HI>HO ANTELUPON BAP∣TISMA</HI> rendered <HI>The like Figure whereunto Baptism, &amp;c. HO</HI> being a Relative of the Neuter, must have an Ante∣cedent of the same Gender in the preceeding Verse, which can't be the Ark, for that is Feminine, but the Water only, which is Neuter. So that St <HI>Peter</HI> certain∣ly meant <HI>that Water</HI> as a Type of Baptism, and not the Ark: And if he did not speak Sense, <HI>J. Mott</HI> must di∣spute it with him.</P>
<P>BUT it is sufficient for me to observe, that the hard∣er St. <HI>Peter</HI> strained himself for the Allusion, by so much the Stronger is the Argument for Water Baptism,
<PB N="x" REF="003489_0012_0FF84C53B745A880"/>since Water is expressly mentioned as the Type, even at the Risque of his own Reputation, if the Quakers must stand Expositors.</P>
<P>AND when <HI>J. Mott</HI> in the same Paragraph expounds the Resurrection of Christ, to be a spiritual raising up of Christ in the Soul: What shall we think he designs to make of the most demonstrative Prove of our Religion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And he will do well to tell us. how he will allegoriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the following Words. <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of God</HI> &amp;c. If the Resurrection be spiritual and inward, the Ascension must be so too. The Evidences of our Religion would soon be demolished, if they were left to these ignorant Allegorizers. But in∣deed they have no Occasion for such Evidences; if it will serve only to turn Men's Minds inward, to such Manifestations as may be found there, without any Thing outward: For whatever they pretend of other Teach∣ers, Christ and his Apostles did not preach such Doctrine, Christ referred Men to his Works, as the fullest Proofs of his Doctrine; and the Apostles preached the Resur∣rection of Christ, that God raised him up, not in their Hearts, but out of the Grave.</P>
<P>BUT I will now add no further upon this, but only ask <HI>J. Mott,</HI> what he imagines St. <HI>Peter</HI> would think if he was now upon Earth, to find his own plain easy Writ∣ings thus wrested by the <HI>Unlearned and U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stable,</HI> as well as those Writings his Brother Paul writ according to the Wisdom given him (that is above others) being a very learned and polite Writer) in whose Epistles St. <HI>Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> says, <HI>are some Things hard to be understood?</HI> His Schollar∣ship carried him sometimes above vulgar Capacities, but little did the plain Fisherman think, his Writings should meet with the same Fate, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii 16.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have added some things farther in the Dialogues, but found them swell to a Bulk faster than
<PB N="xi" REF="003489_0013_0FF84C55DBAD6360"/>expected; perhaps I may find Occasion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dd another Dialogue hereafter. My Aim is to discover Truth, and establish my Flock in the Faith that was <HI>once delivered to the Saints,</HI> a nd preserve them from the wicked Attempts of such Deceivers, as under a Cloak of great Sobriety and Abstractedness from the World, would draw them in∣to Divisions and Parties, and an utter Contempt of what is most valuable in Christianity.</P>
<P>LET me earnestly desire your Prayers with mine, that the Great God of Heaven would succeed my Endeavours for this End, and effectually by his Grace preserve you from all Attempts of wicked Men to seduce you from the Simplicity of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST.</P>

<P>WEllcome <HI>Eusebius,</HI> I am glad thou art come in, just as I have beer neading this <HI>Letter to a Parishioner,</HI> which represents the Consequences of <HI>Quakerism</HI> (as he calls it) very fatal and distructive to the Souls of Men: I would fain know of thee, whe∣ther thou dost not think in thy Conscience the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> to be very good People

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eusebius.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad my coming is acceptible, for indeed I am come with no other Design, but to have a little Discourse with you upon the Sub∣ject of Religion, for I have heard of late, you are inclining to <HI>Quakerism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny the Matter, but freely own my self to be, what thou callest a <HI>Quaker;</HI> but yet if thou canst convince me, 'tis my Duty to be any Thing else, I will hearken to thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you are sincere in promising to hearken to Conviction, this is much better than to resolve you never will be convinced; but I conclude you speak it with a Confidence, that I never can convince you, that is, make you own your selves in an Error; this may indeed be a difficult Task, but 'tis a very easy Matter to offer you sufficient Arguments, to prove <HI>the Conse∣quences of Quakerism fatal to the Souls of Men:</HI> And this in reason ought to convince you, and will do it, if you be not <HI>obstinately prejudiced</HI> or given up to <HI>judicial Infatuation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast Confidence, whatever I have: But why shoulst thou believe me <HI>obstinately pre∣judiced?</HI> Or <HI>given up to judicial Infatuation?</HI> These are hard Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say, <HI>I believe you so:</HI> I enter∣tain Hopes that the Arguments I shall offer will have a proper Influence upon you: Men may be mistaken without being <HI>obstinate,</HI> or <HI>judicially
<PB N="3" REF="003489_0016_0FF84C5D12468EF0"/>infatuated;</HI> and there is ground to hope when this is the Case, that God will have Mercy on them, and bring out them of their Errors, as he did St. <HI>Paul.</HI> But when Wickedness, Irreligion and Prophaneness is the Prelude to Error, and a will∣full Neglect and Contempt of proper Means for their Instruction and Reclaiming, is consequent upon their Wandering, we may well attribute their Continuance in Error, at least to <HI>a Spirit of Infatuation,</HI> sent by God in Judgment to punish their Wickedness and Obstinacy: And of such there is little Hopes of their being reclaimed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou canst not with any Force apply this to the People called <HI>Quakers;</HI> for they are a sober well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>posed, good People, which I pre∣sume <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; a therefore I put this Question to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can make you no such Concessions, their Principles and Practices are very Wicked, whatever Soberness they pretend to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canst thou discern the Heart, and see that they pretend to more Soberness than they have? Is not this uncharitably censuring?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't pretend to see more than is ap∣parent enough; allow them to be as remote from <HI>Intemperance, Carnality, evil Speaking, &amp;c.</HI> as they pretend to aim at, and ten Times so far as the Generality of them are in Practice; yet there is enough appears, to denominate them very wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>If sober Quakers are very wicked, what
<PB N="4" REF="003489_0017_0FF84C5E98EFD1D0"/>are prophane, swearing, drunken Church-Men? You have enough of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are fit for <HI>Quakers</HI> of the highest Form. I have nothing to say in their Justification. Without Repentance they will go to Hell with drunken, lying, cheating, demure Quakers; and you have enough of them too: And if you pre∣tend the contrary, you must tell them that know no beter, if you can find them: But this is known Matter of Fact, <HI>That the Devil's School of Debauchery, Lewdness and Impiety, furnisheth the Common Wealth of Quakers.</HI> 'Tis here their Teachers are trained up, instead of Colleges and Schools of Learning; here they <HI>procced Masters,</HI> and then are fit for <HI>Quakers</HI> of the first Rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away with this Railery; I thought you were more moderate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I speak the Words of Truth in Sober∣ness, and assert nothing but such plain Facts as are known to every Body, and if you desire it I will bring plentiful Proof of 'em. It is very hard Men must be called Railers, for saying of People that are openly and boldly wicked, <HI>that they are so.</HI> That the Quaker Teachers are gene∣rally Men that have been excessively wicked, ir∣religious, and debauched, needs no Proof but their own publick Confessions, from Time to Time. And as to others that turn <HI>Quakers</HI> and become first and foremost in the Herd, you and I can tell of our own Knowledge, so far as we are acquainted, that they are People that have lived
<PB N="5" REF="003489_0018_0FF84C60C3D88710"/>without God in the World, People that never had any serious Sence of their Duty to God, or Re∣gard to Religion; that never lived up to what they professed to believe; whose Irreligion and Wickedness has been the greatest Scandal, to the Religion they were rekoned of: These Things <HI>Tremulus</HI> you know as well as I, to be sorrowful Truths: And if you want more Proof, I will call them in directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou need'st not call Evidences, I per∣ceive what thou intendest, and I don't deny the Matter; many serious good People are Converts from a State of Irreligion and Wickedness; and our Teachers often tell us their Experiences, how very wicked their Hearts and Lives were, before it pleased God to pour his Spirit mightily, upon them, which led them into the Way thou call'st <HI>Quakerism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the very Thing I said, their Lives were before a Contradiction to their Pro∣fession, and they were a Scandal to the Religion they owned; <HI>Christianity</HI> would have had more Credit, if they had professed themselves <HI>Mabome∣tans.</HI> And when all Methods of Conviction and Instruction proved ineffectual to reclaim them, and bring them to a Temper and Spirit becom∣ing Christianity, God gave them up to a Spirit of Error and Infatuation, as a just Judgment upon them, for refusing to be reformed by the powerful Methods of his Grace; as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of some, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii 11. 12. <HI>For this Cause
<PB N="6" REF="003489_0019_0FF81205578BD8E8"/>God shall send them strong Delusions, to believe a Lye, that so they may all be damned who believed not the Truth, but bad Pleasure in Unrighteous∣ness.</HI> We have Reason to fear, this is tne Case with many. And then their Delusions and Lies which they are left to believe, they endeavour to put off for <HI>Divine Inspirations,</HI> and that Fullness of the Spirit they talk of, is no other but such a Spirit as I have now mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their turning from their Vices and Wickedness, to live soberly and virtuously, and perswading others to live in the Fear of God, and to keep from such Wickedness as they once lived in, shews that they are true Converts, and not the Servants of the Devil, as thou woulst insnu∣ate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If they turned from Sin to God, that is <HI>to the Practice of true Religion and Godliness,</HI> and perswaded others to do so, it would be well: But their Conversion is from <HI>Bad</HI> to <HI>Worse,</HI> and their Repentance it self needs to be repented of; and all tne Virtue they practice, and would per∣swade others to, is cons;istent enough with a State of Sin and Servitude to the Devil, whose Interest they more effectually promote now they are <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> than when they were <HI>Debauchees.</HI></P>

<P>If thou canst convince me of this, I will look out for a better Religion; but it seems to me, the Grand Promoter of Wickedness has a hopeful Crew of Servants, if the <HI>Quakers</HI> are his, who shew so much Zeal against Vanity and all sorts of Immorality.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is bad indeed, if all their Zeal pro∣ceed from a Spirit of Error and Infatuation, and while they think they are doing God good Ser∣vice, they are effectully promoting the Devil's in∣terest. Truly thou semest to be a <HI>High-Flyer.</HI></P>

<P>Be not angry, but have a little Pati∣ence and I will prove all I have said, I hope to your Satisfaction: I have no Manner of ill Design in what I have said, I tell you what I verily believe, and what I think I have good Reason to believe, and the Matter is of too great Conse∣quence to trifie with; it is no Kindness to flatter Men in their Errors, and to hold ones Peace when the Salvation of many Souls is at Stake.

<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am for Truth and Charity? and if the <HI>Quakers</HI> are so wicked as thou representest them, it will truly be Charitable in thee, to Undeceive so many good honest People, as are in danger of being led away by 'em; but I am very confident thou wilt not be able to make out what thou hast offered; and thy Condemnation will be the grea∣ter, for being so Uncharitable towards those good People of God.</P>

and good are his. Nor do I think there is any great Danger of good honest People's being led a∣way by 'em; those that are good and honest have the Security of God's Providence and Grace, and are so far under the Guidance and Influence of his holy Spirit dwelling in them, as to be secure from the Danger of Infection, by such extravagant, wild and wicked Principles and Practices as the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s be, God never withdraws his Grace and the Influences of his Spirit, from those that by Baptism have been consigned to the Indwelling and Comforts thereof, till by often grieving his holy Spirit, and quenching his kindly Motions. by neglecting to walk worthy of their high and holy Calling, they provoke his Displeasure against them: And such Men can't be called good honest People, though they may be neither Drunkards nor Fornicators.</P>

<P>I did not make much Profession of any one Sort; indeed I had not that Thought of God and Judgment and Eternity as I hope I now have. I endeavoured to be a good Neighbour, and to be careful about my own Business and to keep clear from the Vices of the Times: I sometimes went to one sort of Worship and sometimes to another, but very seldome to any, however my Neighbours all had a good Opinion of me, and I hope they have no Cause to alter it.</P>

<P>You offer your self for an Instance of a good honest Man turning <HI>Quaker,</HI> and yet confess, when you came to be started at the Thoughts of saddain Death, it put you into great concern, be∣cause you thought your self not fit to die; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed you had reason enough to think so; and
<PB N="10" REF="003489_0023_0FF84C6A79A7A0D8"/>
whatever your Neighbour's Opinion was of you you can't pretend to justify the State you then was in, and therfore you resolved upon mending; in order to which you turned <HI>Quaker,</HI> that is, from <HI>nothing</HI> to <HI>worse;</HI> in short, you seem to have been like many others I can name to you a Man that paid your Debts pretty well, no right down Sot; and if once in a while you got drunk, you was no ways apt to be quarrelsome in your Liquor, but as to any serious Thoughts of your Dependance on God, and the Duties of a Religious Life, they never approached you till you had so long forgotten God, and neglected his gracious Invitations, as to provoke him most justly to give you over to per∣petual Wandring, in Darkness and Error, so as never to find the Way of Life.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say but it might have been just in God to have dealt so with me, but I trust he has been more merciful; and I have Hope.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may have great Hope, and yet when you come into Eternity find it <HI>cut off, and prove but a spider's Webb</HI> you must never call him a good honest man, that lives thoughtless of God and neglectful of Religion, we have many of whom we may say, without Breach of Charity, that they are so sottish and stupid, as to regard the Promisses of Eternal life, and the Discoveries of God's Will in the Gospel, and his kind mercifull Invitations in Christ, as Matters in which they have no manner of Concern: they never trouble themselves what Instances of Obedience and Thankfulness they
<PB N="11" REF="003489_0024_0FF84C6C2EAD1CA8"/>
owe to God, for his unpeakable Favours, to be sure as for any publick Thanks or Praise they give him none, such are stupid Sinners: and their long neglect of God's Invitations, their Irreligion and worldly Immersions, Besides other Sins we don't observe, may denominate them, <HI>Wicked and un∣godly Men;</HI> and it is no Wonder if God permits such to imbrace the foulest Errors: And as this seems to be vours, so its the Case of many others that turn <HI>Quakers;</HI> they never were <HI>good</HI> nor <HI>honest</HI> any further than Men may be, without any serious sense of God or practice of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will instance in one that I think thou canst not except against, <HI>Narcessa</HI> is well known to thee and me, she was brought up in the Way of the Church, and her Parents strict Church Folks, and she a sober Woman, and yet turned <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't pretend that all are good and honest that are brought up in the Church; Men may be Hypocrites in the Church of God, and though their outward Conversation appear regular yet their secret Hypocrisy be such as God abhors: The most excellent Part of Religion, is such as no Eye can see but God's, and the Defects here may be as provoking to God as open Immorality; what secret Wickedness Men may indulge them selves in, their nearest Neighbours can't discern; but, as to <HI>Narcissa</HI> there is enough appears to be an exception against her Goodness, though she be∣lieved and did some Things well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard any thing amiss of her.
<PB N="12" REF="003489_0025_0FF84C6EE844FD90"/>
though she is my near Neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>She never received the <HI>Communion of the Body and blood of Christ</HI> tho' she professed an intire Liking, to the Principles of the <HI>Chruch of England</HI> for many Years after she was come to Discretion; so that she continued in the Neglect of a very important Duty, and which she believed to be so; and in this sinfull Neglect she persisted, notwithstaning many serious Warnings and Ex∣hortations to amend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Srem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps she thought her self not fit for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she knew her self to live in any Habit of Wickedness, and yet for so long Time refused to reform and amend, then she was so far from being <HI>good</HI> and <HI>honest,</HI> as to be a hardened ob∣stinate Creature, fit to make a <HI>Quaker</HI> of; and indeed her wicked Neglect of which she knows to be her Duty, was living in a known State of Sin, and contrary, to her own profession, and sufficient Cause why God should at last abondon her, to a state of Error and wandring as a punishment of her Obstinacy. But besides, she was very remiss and negligent for a long time, in attending that Worship of God which she believed it her Duty to be constant and unmoveable in: And when People grow careless and negligent of their Duty to God, and more and more remiss, instead of improving and growing in Grace, it is no wonder if God abandon them to Error and Delusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="003489_0026_0FF84C710CEAF608"/>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps that seeming Remissness was unavoidable; she is but fa Woman, and thou know'st her Husband is o another Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was undoubtedly a Ground of her Remissness and Neglect; and we may well think it almost unaoidable that it should be so: But if People vountarily put themselves into a State of unavoidable Temptation, they have no Ground to depend upon God's Grace, to preserve them from Error and Wickedness. Religion, being the Means of our Eternal Salvation and Happiness in the Fruition of God, should be our chiefest Care and Concern; and no Wordly Interest or Gratifi∣cation should induce us to put our selves under Disadvantage in this respect: And for a Woman especially, to dispose of herself for Life so as to put herself voluntarily under such a Clogg and Im∣barasment in the Affairs of Religion, shews, that her Care for her Body, is greater then that for her Soul, which is a great Wickedness: This one Care St. <HI>Paul</HI> recommends above all others in Christans marrying, that it should be with those of their own Religion: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii 39. <HI>She is at liberty to marry to whom she will, but only in the Lord.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I don't see what great Consequence this is of; they are sober good, religious People, after they come to be what thou callest <HI>Quakers,</HI> and if so, it matters little what they were before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Consequence of what I have said is considerable. for it showes us what little Ground there is to imagin that God should make choice
<PB N="14" REF="003489_0027_0FF84C732EDE94B8"/>
of these People, to bestow his most distinguishing Favours upon; to make them his choicest Darlings, as they pretend; to dwell personally in them, and reveal his hidden Secrets to 'em, and send them with immediate Commissions to make new Discoveries to the World. But when we see by what Steps, they had prepared and ripened them selves for Vengeance, it will be no Matter of Sur∣prize to find them abandoned by God, and given over to the strongest Delusions; that is, permitted to the power of the Devil, to be actuated and in∣fluenced by him, so as to become his mere Tools and Engines in seducing others, who are in the like preparatary Dipsositions; thus filling up the I leasure of their Wickedness, they become Vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must have some other Reasons to convince us that this is the Case, besides a former State of Wickedness and Irreligion. I confess God might justly, if he so pleased, abandon such wicked People to Error and Delusion; and from what St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, tis undoubtedly true, that he sometimes does so; but thou hast no Rea∣son to pitch upon the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to be the abondoned, for some very wicked Men have Grace given them to repent; and they become good Men and great Instruments of Good to others; thus it was with <HI>Paul</HI> himself, and to the <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI> he says, <HI>such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, &amp;c.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi 11.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am far from denying the Grace of
<PB N="15" REF="003489_0028_0FF84C74DF60E1F8"/>
Repantance; very wicked Men by the grace of God, may become Converts to Piety and Good∣ness: And I allow that their future Life and Practice, must discover whether they receive the Grace of God to Repentance, or for their Ob∣stinacy, become abandoned to Infatuation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let us look to what they are after they become what thou callest <HI>Quakers;</HI> with∣out regarding what they have been before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will lock to what they were after; but yet attending to what they have been before, serves to remove all Cause of Wonderment and Surprize, if we find them yet in a State of Wick∣edness and gross Error, notwithstanding in some Points of Vertue they appear very zealous, and really think themselves guided by the Spirit of God. For tho' some Sinners by the Grace of God become true Penitents, yet great Wickedness is so far from recommending Men to God's special Favour, that on the contrary, it gives Ground to expect his severe Judgment, and Dereliction in Error, when Men persist long in their Wickedness and Irreligion, after proper Means and Opportu∣nities afforded them for their Conviction and Re∣claiming. This is the Case with many that turn <HI>Quakers,</HI> which could not be said of St. <HI>Paul</HI> or the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and yet, either of them might justly have been left to perish in their Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>So long as former Wickedness don't ob∣solutely bar Men from the Grace of God, and his Mercy in Christ, I will hope those thou callest
<PB N="16" REF="003489_0029_0FF84C77CEB895D0"/>
<HI>Quakers,</HI> have the Benefit thereof untill thou shewest, that their Lvies and Conversations after∣wards do not discover the proper Fruits of a true Repentance; if thou canst shew this I will readily give all up, and conclude them to be abandoned of God indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have not left our selves Time to go through the Consideration of this so perticularly as it deserves, let us therefore agree to meet again to morrow, and call in what Assistance you think fit; for I will Endeavour to convince you, that if ever you hope to be saved, you must make a new Choice of your Religion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eusebius.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Hope <HI>Tremulus</HI> by what I offered yesterday, you are convinced, that those People that turn Quakers, are generally so far from such Dispositions as recommend them to God's extraordinary Favour, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e intimate and immediate Communion and Inspirations of his Holy Spirit; that there is much greater Rea∣son to conclude them abandoned for their Wicked∣ness, and so permitted to the Devil's Delusions, by his Instigations to be shape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to such Opini∣ons and Practices as are most ensnaring to them∣selves and pernicious to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tremulus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We concluded yesterday, That their State and Behaviour after they become <HI>Quakers</HI> shall determine, whether God has given them the Grace of Repentance, or in Judgment sent them strong Delusions to believe a Lye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Wickedness I design to prove upon them, is not Swearing, Cheating, Drunkenness, Fornication, and such like; whatever Sins of this Kind any of 'em may be guilty of, shall not be

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope thou wilt not call them Wicked, if they are free from such Vices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are other Sins which polute the Soul with Guilt as black as these, which reflect as great Dishonour to God, and efectually hinder Men's Salvation and Happiness; and these the <HI>Quakers</HI> are Guilty of: Such as the rejecting the possitive Commands and Institutions of Jesus Christ, and refusing to comply with the Methods of Divine Grace for the Salvation of Mankind, and conspiring with the Grand A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lversary, to hin∣der our blessed Redeemer of the Glory of his wonderful Atchievements, and the Honour just∣ly due to him, as the King of the Church, and the Delieverer of Mankind; in as much as they instigate others, as themselves are instigated by the Divil, to contemn, despise and neglect those sacred Ordinances and Rites of Worship institut∣ed for the Honour of Christ, to express his King∣ly Power, and the Wisdom of his Government, and to be Memorials of his Glorious Acts, as well as Means effectually to secure and promote the Salvation and Happiness of Men: And while they are promoting these Hellish Designs, and indeed, that they may promote them the more effectually, they pretend Friendship to Christ, and immediate Inspiration of his Spirit, and Commissions from God, to Authorize them here∣to; and what greater Wickedness can Men be guilty of.</P>

<P>If these Things be true, thou needst say no more: But for my Part I am very far from believing they intend or design any such Dishonour or Disrespect to Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is undoubtedly the real Tendency and event of their Practices, whatever their De∣signs be; they may really believe their Practices have a contrary tendency; this is a natural Ef∣fect of those strong Delusions to which they are given up, as a Punishment of their former volun∣tary Wickedness and irreligion: And nothing is more agreeable to what St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, of their <HI>believing Lies that so they may be damned,</HI> than that being permitted to the Devils Delusions, they should really believe, they are compassing their Salvation, while, for that Reason, they are the more zealously promoting the Devils great Aim and Design, to dishonur Christ, discredit and de∣stroy Religion, and bring about their own hea∣vier Damnation. Let their Designs be as they will, if their Practices have such a Tendency as I have mentioned, it shews, that their Fruits are not meet for Repentance, and whatever Change may appear in them, they are not converted to God: And if their Practices discover this, you have consented already, that they are deluded by the Devil.</P>

<P>They hold to the Baptism of Christ, and the Lord's Supper; and do not deny, reject and contemn them as thou sav'st.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>They allow that Christ instituted Bap∣tism and a holy Supper, because the Institution thereof is so very clear, that they can have no manner of face ot deny it; but yet they virtually and effectually reject, deny and contemn them, by substituting their own Inventions in the Room of what Christ commanded to be done. So that they deny and contemn those Instances, of Honour and Duty that Christ commanded, and under those Names set up what themselves have invented: And thus, their own Inventions they have exalted above Christ's Institutions, and his Commands they treat with Scorn and blasphem∣ous Scurrility, that they may put the stamp of Di∣vine Authority upon their own Whims and De∣vices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is the very Thing they charge upon thee, and others that are for setting up out∣ward Ceremonies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am for setting up no outward Ceremo∣nies as Institutions of Christ; but those I find set up by Christ himself, and have been observed in all Ages of his Church, I am for paying an Ho∣nour to: And whoever reject them, do it upon the Peril of their own Damnation, <HI>Mark,</HI> xvi 16.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Christ's Baptism and the Lord's Supper don't consist in any outward Ceremonies, but are merely Spirtual and inward; and I wonder how thou canst call the Work of God's Spirit,</HI> Men's Whims and Devices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was never the Work of God's Spirit, but the whims of Quakers Brains, to call any mere internal Action or Motion <HI>Christian Bap∣tism,</HI> or the Baptism that Christ has instituted in his Church: This is a device of their own. And those very Motions and Impressions which they feel in themselves, and call <HI>Inward Baptism,</HI> and <HI>Spirit Baptism,</HI> you can never prove nor perswade me they come from the Spirit of God: God's Spirit indeed dwells in his own faithful People, but not in the Wicked and Reprobate, and those that are abandoned to Error and Delusion. Such Men may feel Motions and inward Impulses, but they come rather from the Devil than from the Spirit of God. And even in good Men that have the Guidance and Comforts of the Holy Ghost, and feel his inward Motions, it would be very im∣proper to call those Inspirations <HI>Chrisian Bap∣tism,</HI> because they are never so called in Scripture and what the Scriptures call <HI>Baptism,</HI> that was commanded and instituted by Christ, believed in and practiced by his Apostles and his Church ever since, was an external Washing to consign the indwelling and Comforts of the holy Ghost, whose gracious Inspirations are therefore a Privi∣ledge consequent upon Baptism, but not Baptism it self.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Thus thou wouldst turn Men away from the inward Work of God's Spirit in their own Hearts, to outward Ceremonies and Traditions of Men, and therein place the Substance of Religion. This is what</HI> James Mott <HI>has taken Notice of, in his little Book lately Printed, and very will ob∣serves the contrary Practice in the People called Quakers, which he observes too to have been the Concern of true Ministers in all Ages, to turn Peo∣ples Mind to obey the Teaching of God's Sprit in their own Hearts,</HI> p 2. <HI>And this Work of the Spirit is what we account Baptism in Subtance, and Christ's Baptism,</HI> p. 29.</P>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what Opinion you have of <HI>J.

<P><HI>Pray don't speak so contemptibly of</HI> J. Mott and his little Book; we reckon he has per∣form'd, wonderfully: Besides what he has printed was first approved and is recommended by our wiser Heads, who understand what is Truth and Falshood as well as thy self.</P>

Inventions (for the Substance of Religion) instead of and against the Work of Christ's Spirit in Peo∣ples Hearts.</HI> This is an absolute Falshood: And the same he sundry Times mentions in his Book, only because we plead for outward Obedience to the Commands of Christ, where he has com∣manded outward Actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is an inward Spiritual Work that is to be understood, where you take the Thing con∣manded to be an outward Action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will try that by and by: But when we believe and teach, that these very outward Actions are accompanied with a spiritual Influ∣ence and Energy: That Baptism with Water is a Spiritual Regeneration, wherein we are born of the <HI>Spirit</HI> as well as <HI>Water;</HI> that we become hereby entituled to the indwelling, comforting and sanctifying Influences of the holy Ghost; and reckon our selves hereby obliged and bound by professed Stipulation, to conduct our Lives for the future according to his holy Guidence and graci∣ous Inspirations: And the same Engagements we renew as often as we receive the holy Supper, and believe we receive larger Measures of the holy Spirit, whose gracious Influences support our spiritual Life: And to this we apply that of the Apostle, <HI>We are all made to Drink into one Spirit.</HI> When this is well known to be our Doctrine and Belief, set forth in our publick Of∣fices, by the publick Writing of our Doctors, and taught publickly and frequently from all our

<PB N="25" REF="003489_0038_0FF84C8AA8240428"/>
and of all Vertues.</HI> In the Collect for Christmass we pray God, to <HI>grant that we being Regenerate and made his Children by Adoption and Grace, may daily be renewed by his holy Spirit.</HI> In the Collect for the Circumcision of Christ, we pray God to <HI>Grant us the true Circumcision of the Spirit, that our Hearts and all our Members being mortifyed, from all wordly and carnal Lusts, &amp;c.</HI> And eve∣ry Sunday, in the Collect for the Communion we pray God to <HI>cleanse the Thoughts of our Hearts, by the Inspiration of his holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love him, &amp;c.</HI> Do these Things look like turning Men away from the inward Work of the Spirit?

<P>You must go to the first Rise of a Thing to find whose Invention it is, and by whom com∣manded and instituted, and especially as to what Christ instituted, you must go back to the Time of his living upon Earth, his Institutions all bear date about that Time: New seeing <HI>John</HI> had a Command from God to baptize with Water, and our Saviour himself was baptized, that he Might

fulfill all Righteousness, and baptized with Wa∣ter himself, at least by his Ministers, whilst he was upon Earth, and sent his Apostles out with a Commission, after his Resurrection <HI>to baptize,</HI> without mentioning a Word of changing the Mat∣ter they had been used to; and seeing we find it so evident, that the Apostles after our Saviour's Ascension into Heaven did baptize with Water, not in the Name of <HI>John</HI> or the <HI>Pope,</HI> but <HI>in the Name of the Lord Jesus, Act.</HI> viii 16. which the Quakers allow to be Water Baptism: What can you think of their Sense or Honesty to call Wa∣ter Baptism the Inventions of Men, and say we set up Men's Inventions against the Work of the Spirit.</P>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hold an inward sanctifying and com∣forting Influence of God's Spirit, but not in all Men, nor in any to set aside the Use of Reason or any instituted Means of Grace, but co-operat∣ing with our natural Faculties, assisting them in a due use of such Means as are appointed to in∣struct and engage us in the Practice of our Duty. But Pray can you tell what <HI>J. Mott</HI> means in sundry Passages of his Letter, where he intimates that there is something very remarkable in the Quakers Religion, in respect of an inward Light, to which they turn Men's Minds as to the Spirit of God, for all teaching and Instruction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He intends, that Convictions of Truth come only from God's Spirit in us, that all Men have a Measure of this Sprit that will teach them all Things that concern their Salvation, if they will but attend to it; and that the People called Quakers, instead of perswading Men to outward Performances and Ceremonies, only direct them to bearken to such Teaching as they will find in them∣selves without going to any Men to teach them; and that all Religion, Hope and Comfort consists in such inward Feelings and Motions as every
<PB N="31" REF="003489_0044_0FF84C98868478E8"/>
Man's Spirit will guide him to, without any manner of outward Performances.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not Mens Duty then to hearken to this inward Spirit, and is it not necessary they should know this to be their Duty, and the only Way to be happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, and this is what our Teach∣ers perswade Men to, and to depend wholly upon Christ and his Spirit in their own Hearts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus while they are teaching outward∣ly and prescribing Men's Duty in the most ne∣cessary Part, they juggle them into a Belief, that they have no outward Teaching, but all is in ward and from Gods Spirit, and not from any Man; and certainly all the Labours of all your Teachers are wholy useless upon this Principle; but the Matters of Fact are false, and you cannot but know them so; they depend upon outward Teachings as much as others. In <HI>Sewal</HI>'s Histo∣ry of the Quakers, there is a Letter of <HI>Samuel Crisp,</HI> and another of <HI>Evan Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans,</HI> both giving an Account of their Conversion to Quakerism, and they ascribe it to reading <HI>Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Apology</HI> firstly, and then compleated by others Books and Conversation, and one of them mentions a very hearty shaking of Hands among the Quakers. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xal gives an Account that <HI>George Fox</HI> perswa∣ded and convinced many, and it was by speaking not much but powerfully. This is the same outward Way that all false Teachers take, to per∣swade Men of what they would have them believe
<PB N="32" REF="003489_0045_0FF84C9AC3453820"/>
and receive. If all Men have a Light or Spirit within them, teaching them all Things, why don't they leave them to that Teaching? or else why do they impose such Falshoods upon the World, that they depend upon an inward Spirit, and turn People to that, and not to outward Teach∣ings of Men? Can any Body think, but that the Books that the Quakers have written and printed and dispersed, are designed to perswade and turn People to be of their Religion. And though they perswade them against some outward Performan∣ces, that we believe and teach to be necessary, yet they have outward Performances of their own instead of them; they pretend to pray as loud as other People, and hold forth their Principles and teaching with a Voice that may be heard with outward Ears, without being in 'em; they have Weekly Meetings, and Monthly and Yearly &amp; Quarterly, according as the Sun passeth through the several Signs in the <HI>Zodiak:</HI> Thus they ob∣serve Times and Seasons, Days and Months and Quarters, according to their own wicked Inventi∣ons, honouring their own Traditions above the ordinances of Jesus Christ.</P>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find Fault with <HI>J. Mott</HI>'s Falshood, in pretending the Quakers Religion is purely in∣ward and, and opposing of it as the Religion of the Apostles and the Gospel of Christ, to out∣ward Performances and Rites of Divine Worship,
<PB N="33" REF="003489_0046_0FF84C9CE5C6A780"/>
instituted by Christ himself: For though an in∣ward sanctifying Work of the Spirit upon the Soul be necessary, as we believe and teach, yet out∣ward Acts of Worship and Honour are required of us, and the Instructions of holy Scriptures are necessary to establish our Faith and direct our Practice, and for the explaining and enforcing these, Christ has appointed his Ministers, who ought to be received as the Ambassadors of Christ, and their Business is to teach Men the Way of Salvation, which no ways hinders the Teaching of God's Spirit in the Hearts of his faithful People, but cooperates with it. And so far as the Qua∣kers labour to set aside the Use and Necessity of such outward Teaching, they impeach the Wis∣dom of Christ, and take part with the Devil, who would gladly overthrow the whole Christian Oe∣conomy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can they fight against Christ, when they perswade People to hear Christ only, speaking in their own Hearts, waiting upon the Lord in Silence, which our Friend <HI>Barclay</HI> will tell you is by withdrawing their Minds from all Meditations and Thoughts that so Christ with his Light may come in upon '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This which they call waiting upon the Lord in Silence, even from all Thougnts, is one of the most crafty Delusions the Devil could put into their Heads; Christ requires no Service of us but what is performed with the Exercise of our best Reason, but when Men put
<PB N="34" REF="003489_0047_0FF84C9FDDFCF0E0"/>
themselves into such a stupid State of Expectancy, with a perswasion that the first sudden Impression upon their Minds will then certainly come from Christ, and be a Motion of his Spirit, they have delivered up themselves to the Power of the Devil, in the most essectual manner that can be; for, as they have no reason to think that Christ will thus dart Impressions upon their Minds, so they may be assured the Devil will be ready to do it, when he has an Opportunity of being received as Christ himself, and thus to have the Advantage of Guiding them as he pleaseth; and we may well think he has Craft enough to carry on the Juggle, when he is entred so fairly, by insinuating that all is for the Glory of God, and Benefit of their Souls to which he is leading them: This is the most effectual Delusion. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trem.</SPEAKER>
<P>J. Mott <HI>shews that the Way Christ mani∣fests himself is by inward Feelings, and that thus Christ is in us the Hope of Glory, and calling such Feelings and Manifestations, the Devils Delusions, is turning Men away from Christ, which is pernici∣ous Doctrine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil may transform himself into an Angel of Light, and nothing can put Mens Souls into greater Danger, than perswading them to believe that all such Feelings and Im∣pressions as they find upon their Imaginations after shutting up all the Avenues of Sense and Reason, are the Manifestations of Christ: Good Men may feel Impressions and Motions from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Spirit of christ, this I don't deny at all; but there are many inward motions from the Devil too; and such Wicked Men as don't belong to Christ have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of his Spirit. And this I believe of the Quakers; St. <HI>Jude</HI> says, <HI>these be they that sepa∣rate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit, v.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.

To worship God in Spirit and Truth, is, with a true Devotion of Heart and inward Sincerity, to perform all such Acts of Religion as tend to God's Glory and Honour, according to the Commands and Institutions of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; and if we would know what they are we must search the Scriptures, and follow the Footsteps of the holy Apostles and faithful Disci∣ples of Christ, that were instructed by the Apostles, who through Faith and Patience now inhe∣rit the Promises. <HI>Brethren,</HI> (saith <HI>Paul, Phil.</HI> iii 17.) <HI>he Followers together of me, and mark those that walk, as ye have us for an Ensample.</HI></P>

If yau can shew that the Disciples and Followers of Jesus Christ are required to observe any outward Baptism, and outward Eating of Bread and Drinking Wine, to remember Christ, I will grant you, that those called Quakers are no Disciples of Christ; For whatever Christ's Bap∣tism is, I know we can't be in Christ without it, and unless we eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, we have no Part in him.</P>

<P>The Necessity of Christ's Baptisim I am glad you allow, and <HI>Edward Burling</HI> will tell you, that Men can't be sav'd without it: Of the Lord's Supper we will discourse by and by; we will first see what is to be said of Baptism: The Letter which <HI>J. Mott</HI> pretends to answer had gi∣ven a plain and easy Account of the Nature and Benefits of Christian Baptism, as set forth in the Writings of the Apostles. What <HI>Mott</HI> chiefly un∣dertakes is to assert, That the Apostles in the Texts cited in the aforesaid Letter, don't mean Baptism with Water, but <HI>Spirit Baptism:</HI> Now I desire before we proceed farther, you or your

<P>I shall be glad to take his Meaning rightly, and I desire you to do the best you can to defend him: But truly his Meaning is not so plain to me as you seem to imagine. <HI>p.</HI> 8 He says, it was not Water Baptism that People were saved by, but the Work of Christ, who washeth the Souls of his Peaple by the Spirit of Judgment and Burning, <HI>Isa.</HI> iv 4.</P>

<P>This is a Way of being baptized that I am confident no Nation will be fond of, and I question whether the Body of Quakers will own they expect to be baptised after that Sort; and if ever they come to it, it must be in the next World, and then they will be like to fail of the cleansingand purging Part of the Judgment and Burning, unless you can bring better Proofs for a <HI>Purgalo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> than the <HI>Papists</HI> have ever done.</P>

Reference to the Baptism of Christ as <HI>J.

<SPEAKER>Titius.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Cause is good however</HI> J.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>We allow, and our Ministers Preach the Necessity of an inward Work of the Spirit as much as any People can do, and our Use for Water in Baptism, as it is designed to signify this, can be no more Hindrance thereto than our Savour's using outward Water with a spiritual Significancy, in the Instance we mentioned but now; and there∣fore you may see <HI>J. Mott</HI> misseth his Mark, when he would make you believe our outward Ceremo∣nies are such a Hindrance of the Spirit, and such
<PB N="45" REF="003489_0058_0FF84CB7AAA4FE00"/>
a Substistuting of something else in his Room, as to make our Religion a new Gospel, rather than the Quakers. That <HI>Cant p.</HI> 19 20 will not pass, and so <HI>J. Mott</HI> may ene take it back again, without any further Reply to it. But whatever Necessity there is of an inward Work of the Spirit, in order to Mens being saved eternally, yet those Disposi∣tions or Tempers, be they what they will, that are thereby wrought in us, are never meant by the Word Baptism in scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Titius.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what thou meanest by Dis∣positions and Tempeors, but Repentance and Con∣version being wrought in us by the Spirt, burning. up the Chaffy Nature, is Christ's Baptism.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed this is what the <HI>Quakers</HI> seem to intend, at least <HI>J.

Mott,</HI> by that Work of the Spirit which is Spirit Baptism intend, such a Distruction of the Chaffy sinfull Nature, by the Troubles which Men endure from the sight of their sinfull guilty Condition, as brings them to the Sorrows of Repentance and a hearty Conversion from former their Wickedness to serve God for the future.</P>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I affirm that nothing of this Nature was, ever called Baptism in Scripture or in the least in∣tended where we read of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost; nor had <HI>J.

Mott</HI> pretends to answer, says, Baptism is called regeneration, <HI>or the washing of Regenerati∣on,</HI> Tit. iii 5. <HI>J.

This is the Force of his Reasoning; but is not the great Work of Repentance and Conversion Works of Righteous∣ness? or are they Works of Sin? certainly repen∣ting and turning from Sin to serve God faithfully are works of Righteousness, by this therefore we are, not there said to be saved, as <HI>J.

<P>This is <HI>Robert Barclay's</HI> Sophistry, I have read his Arguments at Large in his Apology and the Syllogisms he makes upon it; but they are all answered by distinguishing between the Work of Christ and his <HI>Institution. John</HI> speaks of what Christ was <HI>to do personally,</HI> as a Demon∣stration of his Divinity which is Baptizing not literally but metaphorically, and this Promise or Prophesy was actually fullfilled according to
<PB N="50" REF="003489_0063_0FF84CC3C3A3E280"/>
the true Intent and Meaning thereof, when after our Saviour's Ascension, he sent down the holy Ghost upon his Disciples, in that miraculous Man∣ner, of which read <HI>Act.</HI> ii. and at sundry Times after: The Baptism Christ instituted, is what he gave Commission to his Apostles to administer, and of this <HI>John</HI> made no Mention; and this ought to be understood literally, which is with Water, unless <HI>Barclay</HI> or some other Quaker will give a beter Reason for a metaphorical Interpre∣tation than I have yet heard.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. <HI>Peter</HI> only observes, that it was an Argument with him to admit the Gentiles to the Priviledge of Baptism with Water, because he saw that Christ had accepted them, by bestowing the same Gift upon them that he had bestowed upon the Disciples at first, which was in fulfill∣ment of his gracious Promise; this he remem∣bred, and when he saw the like special Favour granted to <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his House, he could not but think them worthy to be admitted into the Society of Christ's Church, by that Baptism Christ had instituted, which was with water. In all these Places there is not one Word said of Christ's Instituting Spirit Baptism, as you call it, or that the Apostles understood the Baptism Christ insti∣tuted to be spiritual without Water.</P>

<SPEAKER>Titius.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>If these Proofs don't serve, I will bring you a Text that is plain and possitive, 'tis</HI> 1 Cor. xii 13. <HI>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body: What can be plainer?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>J. Mott</HI> and <HI>E. Burling</HI> think this a plain Proof, that Christ's Baptism is spiritual and without Water; but I can't see any such plain Proof in it: It seems to me the Apostle mean to joyn Water and the Spirit, as we understand Baptism in our Church.</P>

<SPEAKER>Titius.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Spirit is expresely mentioned, but nothing is said of the Water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to the literal Signification of the Word Baptize, it implies an outward applica∣tion, which can't be understood of any Thing but Water, especially considering Water was then made use of in Baptism. <HI>Baptizing</HI> signifies ei∣ther <HI>Washing</HI> or <HI>Immersion,</HI> thus our Savious says, the <HI>Jews</HI> held <HI>the Washing of Cups and Platters, Mark.</HI> vii 4. Now to say of a Cup or Pot, that it is well washed, who would not understand natu∣rally, the Water had been used about it: And in that Place the original Word is <HI>Baptism.</HI> But as touching these <HI>Corinthians,</HI> it is very evident they were baptized with Water as well as by one Spirit. In the first Chapter of this same Epistle St. <HI>Paul</HI> finding Fault with the Party-Names and Divisions among them, useth this Argument to convince them they ought to be united and o di∣vided into parties, that they were not baptized into the Names of those after whom they called themselves, particularly to those that said, I am of <HI>Paul,</HI> to distinguish themselves from those who said they were of <HI>Apollos</HI> or <HI>Cephas,</HI> he fars to them. Chap. i 13. <HI>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized into the Name of Paul?</HI> Intimating that they had but one Head or Master, and that was Christ, who was crucified for them, and into whose Name they were all baptized; now this Baptizing the Quakers allow to be with Water, because <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="003489_0066_0FF84CCA9914E218"/>
thanked God he had only baptized such and such. And indeed the Reason he thanked God for it was, that their dividing Dispositions should have no Advantage from that, as though he had baptized into his own Name, to make a Body or Party of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. under his own Name: When there∣fore Baptism in his same Epistle is spoken of as a combining the Baptized in a Body, it is natural to understand it of the same Thing, when he says over again, <HI>we are baptized into one Body,</HI> though he there mentions the Spirit to correspond with the Argument he was upon, for the Spirit and the Water may agree in one Effect, as we always understand it, according to the Words of our Sa∣viour. <HI>Joh.</HI> iii 5. <HI>Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit, &amp;c.</HI> and 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> v 8. <HI>The Spirit the Water and the Blood, these three agree in one.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I argue for plain and evident Facts, and the Consequences make themselves: But I have now answered to all the Arguments I think you have to produce in behalf of what you call Spirit Baptism, without Water; what is Metaphorical∣ly called Baptizing with the holy Ghost in the se∣veral Texts, was the miraulous Gift of the holy Ghost, sent down by Christ himself in a visible Manner: there was an outward appearance of
<PB N="54" REF="003489_0067_0FF84CCC2D0F4740"/>
firey Tongues overshadowing them; and there was nothing called Baptizing with the holy Ghost without this miraculous Appearance, and when∣ever we shall see this upon a Congregation of Quakers, accompanied with the same inward Ef∣fects, as we read <HI>Act.</HI> ii. we will conclude they have been baptized by Christ himself with the holy Ghost and with Fire, and will take this for such a clear Proof of Christ's accepting their Per∣sons, that none forbid Water that they may receive the Baptism Christ has instituted to en∣title Men to the Priviledges of his Church, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> argues in the Case of <HI>Cornelius;</HI> but if after that they should refuse Water, I should say of them, <HI>they have received the Grace of God in vain:</HI> But what is the Work which the Quakers call Repentance and Conversion in Comparison of the visible Descent of the holy Ghost? It is no∣thing like it, nor have they any Thing among them that ever had the Name of Baptism in Scrip∣ture, so far are they from the Conditions of Sal∣vation, <HI>Mark</HI> xvi 16.</P>

<P>And is it not as great an Absurdity to tell People that their Bodies are framed in the Womb, when they can give no Account how it was done?

<P>You do as <HI>J.

The Spirit and Water are joyned together in Christian Baptism; and in this Text, if Sprinkling the Heart be the spiritual Part of Bap∣tism, the outward Part and visible Sign is plain∣ly enough expressed too, the Washing the Body in pure Water; you can have no Face for mak∣ing this an internal Action, nor say that this out∣ward Washing is not mentioned as the Christians Confidence. Take the whole Action together, and then think when Men have their Sins remitted by being Baptized, a Belief of this Quiets their Consciences, that were before guilty and condemning, so that a Belief of Remillion takes away an evil Conscience, which is a Conse∣quence of being baptized with Water.</P>

<P>'Tis evident and the Quakers allow that he commanded some Baptism to be continued in the Church, as a necessary Means of Salvation.

<P>J.

his Hetrodoxy, see the Sense with the reciprocal Use of these Names; the Water he says is the Spirit too, as 'tis often used in Scripture, then the Apostle must say after this Manner,<HI>Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, that he</HI> (i. e. Christ) <HI>might cleanse and sanctify it by the Work of Christ by Christ.</HI> It will be the same Nonsence if it be (<HI>with the Work of the Spirit by the Spirit.</HI>) But if you will allow the Apostle to speak but common Sense, the Water must be understood literally, and then I will not contend about the following Passage, <HI>viz. by the Word,</HI> if it be, as <HI>J.

<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You understand baptizing here to be with Water, though this Text says no more of Water then <HI>Matt</HI> xxviii, 19, and there is as much Reason to understand Water in that plain Com∣mission, as in this of St.<HI>Paul,</HI> especially consi∣dering that in other Places the Quakers, allow Water to be implyed, in the Word <HI>Baptize</HI> where there is nothing to determine it to a metaphorical Sense as <HI>Act.</HI> viii 12.16. cited by <HI>J. Mott</HI> p. 20, so that the other Apostles had a plain Commissi∣on to do, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith he was not sent for; so that either his Commission was different from theirs, and then his Words don't disprove an Insti∣tution of Water, or else to reconcile his Words to his Practice and the Commission <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii, we must understand this Expression not absolutely negative but Comparatively only; thus the Par∣ticle <HI>Not</HI> is often used in Scripture, and such a Manner of Speech is often used without designing an absolute Negative.</P>

<P>I could give you a great many Instances; but two or three plain ones will suffice <HI>Jer.</HI> vii, 22. <HI>I spake not unto your Fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them up out of the Land of Egypt, concerning burnt Offerings or Sacri∣fices, but this thing Commanded I them, &amp;c.</HI> Only intimating. that God laid more Weight upon stedfast Obedience, than upon Sacrifices and
<PB N="60" REF="003489_0073_0FF84CD99F4A5C58"/>
burnt Offerings. There is a plainer Instance yet Hos. vi, 6. <HI>I disire Mercy and not Sacrifice and the Knowledge of God more than burnt Offering;</HI> to which our Saviour refers Matt. xii, 7. <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had known what this mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I will have Mercy</HI> and <HI>not Sacrifice,</HI> &amp;c. He must be extremly ignorant, that don't know God required Sacri∣fices and burnt offering under the Law, but he laid greater weight upon Mercy. so St. <HI>Paul</HI> had realy a Commission to baptize, but preaching. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gospell was a Work that more required his Masterly Abbities. However same he did.bap∣tize even of those Corinthians; and in other Phers of his Travels we find he Baptized, as at Ma∣cedonia, Lydia and her House, the Joylor and his House: at <HI>Ephesus</HI> he found some that were looked upon Disciples of Jesus only having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> baptized with the Baptism of John.

Act.</HI> xix, which seemes to me a plain Intimation, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought Baptism with Water essential to a Chri∣stian or Disciple of Jesus Christ; when he heard they were Disciples he concludes certainly they must have been baptized with Water; and when they tell him they had only been baptized into <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism, St. <HI>Paul</HI> lets them know, there was something farther necessary to make them Christians; for even <HI>John's</HI> Baptism Engaged them to receive the Religion of Christ which

<P>We don't deny the use of Water Baptism in the Apostles Time; but they did it in their own Freedom <HI>J. Mott</HI> tells you <HI>p.</HI> 9, i. e. Upon their own Heads, (as we often say) without any Au∣thority or Command of Christ therefore.</P>

<P>This is a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Shift, and has neither Reason nor Scripture to suport it. They had Authority from Christ by the Commission <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii, 19, to baptize; they constantly in every Place, where Men were converted by their Preaching, used Water and called it baptizing,
<PB N="62" REF="003489_0075_0FF84CDE2AF1F520"/>
and never called any thing else they did by that Name: of this they speak in such Manner as plainly to intimate the Necessity of it, and the consequent Benefits:And from their Example it has always been esteemed honourable in the Church, and practiced every where with an Opinion of its being a Means to make Men the Disciples of Christ and Entitle them to the Priviledges of Christianity; and indeed this opinion is sufficiently justifyed by the Manner of Expression <HI>Act.</HI> viii, 16, and xix, 5. they were <HI>baptized in Name of the Lord Jesus:</HI> for my part I should take this Expression to intimate a Command or Power derived from Christ, to do what is said to be done in <HI>his Name; ARISE∣IS</HI> into the Name means that Baptism with Water, Entituled them to wear the Name of Christ, made them Christians, put them under the Discipline of his Religion, with a Title to the Priviledges of it; still, it will infer as strong∣ly Christ's Institution, without which it could have none of these Effects. Besides this, the Letter <HI>J. Mott</HI> pretends to answer, had argued for a divine Institution or appointment of Water Baptism from <HI>Act.</HI> xx, 10, 16, to which <HI>J.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Euseb.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> bids the <HI>Corinthians</HI> shew forth he Lord's Death till he come; I suspect the Qua∣kers realty believe no coming of Christ but what 7. <HI>Mott</HI> calls in Spirit in them, nor no Resurrec∣tion of Christ but in their Souls. And if Chfist is not to come bodily and visibly, then neither did he ascend visibly and bodily; and the Conse∣quence of making these Things merely spiritual and allegorical (if the Quakers do so) is to de∣stroy the Foundation of our Hope, and make the Apostles all Lyars, and the Faith of Christians all vain. But let J. Mott for once be in the Right, if by Passovcr he means the Supper of the Lord, out Saviour celebrated it with his Disciples to shew they should seed upon his Body and Blood spiritually, when he should be spiritually in them. And certainly for a Master to do a Thing before the Eyes of his Servants, to shew them hew to do it, is a very proper familar and easy Way of Instructing, and thus indeed we believe our blested Saviour taught his Disciples what he in tended they shoul]dl do in order to make a shew or Memorial of his Death: But would not any Body think then. they ought to do as they were shewd? Which was to perfrom an outward Ac∣tion
<PB N="66" REF="003489_0079_0FF84CE707B60F60"/>
with a spiritual Signification. And without such outward Action, they never can do as they were shewed. And it is very plain that the Apo∣stles, and the Church of Christ ever since, have observed our Lord's Direction in this Point, (ex∣cept some Popish Corruptions which our Church hath reformed according to the primitive Model) and especially may we find plain Instruction in this Mater from St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Directions to the <HI>Co∣rinthians,</HI> whom he commends for observing the Ordinances as he had delivered 'em to them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi 2. And though in respect to this Ordi∣nance, he finds Fault with scme Irregularities in their manner of Celebration, yet he is so far from intimating an Indifference as to the obser∣vation it self, that he asserts the Divine Institution <HI>v.</HI> 23. And what he had received in Command from Christ. lie goes on to relate to them, which is an outward taking the Bread and Cup, and after giving Thanks and Blessing, to bid them all real∣ly cat and Drink, to she forth the Lord's Death, which as he exhorts them to <HI>v.</HI> 26, 28. so in the preceeding Chapter he relates such Effects and Benefits of receiving these outward Symbols of Christ's Body and Blood, as must certainly prove an Institution of perpetual Use and Necessity, 1 Cor. x 16, 17. <HI>The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we breaks, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? For we
<PB N="67" REF="003489_0080_0FF84CEA5F539B88"/>

<P>The Epistles to the several Churches were adapted to some particuler Emergencies, and we are not to imagin, they contain all Instructions the Apostles gave to these Churches; but as they preached one Religion every where, we may con∣clude, that whatever is delivered as Christian Doctrine or Institution to one Church, the same was taught in all the rest, and particular as to this Epistle, we find that all Christians in every Place are concerned in the Contents of it, it is a Catho∣lick Epistle, directed to the <HI>Corinthians, with all that in every Place call on the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i 2. And the Benefits of this Institution here mentioned are such as are ab∣solutely necessary for all Christians, and therefore the Celebration a Duty for all; and accordingly we read that the first Converts to Christianity con∣tinued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayer, <HI>Act.</HI> ii 24.

Thus you see the silly ignorant Creature opposite to himself as well as to all Truth and Reason If <HI>J.
