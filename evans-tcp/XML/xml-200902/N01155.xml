<HEAD><HI>The Grammarians Funeral,</HI> OR, An ELEGY composed upon the Death of Mr. <HI>John Woodmancy,</HI> formerly a School-Master in <HI>Boston:</HI> But now Published upon the DEATH of the Venerable Mr. Ezekiel Chevers, The late and famous School-Master of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> Who Departed this Life the <HI>Twenty-first</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1708. Early in the Morning. In the Ninety-fourth Year of his Age.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>EIght Parts of <HI>Speech</HI> this Day wear <HI>Mourning Gowns</HI></L>
<L>Declin'd <HI>Verbs, Pronouns, Participles, Nouns.</HI></L>
<L>And not declined, <HI>Adverbs</HI> and <HI>Conjunctions,</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>Lillies</HI> Porch they stand to do their functions.</L>
<L>With <HI>Preposition;</HI> but the most affection</L>
<L>Was still observed in the <HI>Interjection.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Substantive</HI> seeming the limbed best,</L>
<L>Would set an hand to bear him to his Rest.</L>
<L>The <HI>Adjective</HI> with very grief did say,</L>
<L>Hold me by strength, or I shall faint away.</L>
<L>The Clouds of Tears did over-cast their faces,</L>
<L>Yea all were in most lamentable <HI>Cases.</HI></L>
<L>The five <HI>Declensions</HI> did the Work decline,</L>
<L>And <HI>Told</HI> the <HI>Pronoun Tu,</HI> The work is thine:</L>
<L>But in this case those have no call to go</L>
<L>That want the <HI>Vocative,</HI> and can't say O!</L>
<L>The <HI>Pronouns</HI> said that if the <HI>Nouns</HI> were there,</L>
<L>There was no need of them, they might them spare:</L>
<L>But for the sake of <HI>Emphasis</HI> they would,</L>
<L>In their Discretion do what ere they could.</L>
<L>Great honour was confer'd on <HI>Conjugations,</HI></L>
<L>They were to follow next to the <HI>Relations.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Amo</HI> did love him best, and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>cco</HI> might</L>
<L>Alledge he was his Glory and Delight.</L>
<L>But <HI>Lego</HI> said by me he got his skill,</L>
<L>And therefore next the <HI>Herse</HI> I follow will.</L>
<L><HI>Audio</HI> said little, hearing them so hot,</L>
<L>Yet knew by him much Learning he had got.</L>
<L>O <HI>Verbs</HI> the <HI>Active</HI> were, Or <HI>Passive</HI> sure,</L>
<L><HI>Sum</HI> to be <HI>Neuter</HI> could not well endure.</L>
<L>But this was common to them all to Moan</L>
<L>Their load of grief they could not soon <HI>Depone.</HI></L>
<L>A doleful Day for <HI>Verbs,</HI> they look so <HI>moody,</HI></L>
<L>They drove Spectators to a Mournful Study.</L>
<L>The <HI>Verbs</HI> irregular, 'twas thought by some,</L>
<L>Would break no rule, if they were pleas'd to come.</L>
<L><HI>Gaudeo</HI> could not be found; fearing disgrace</L>
<L>He had with-drawn, sent <HI>Maereo</HI> in his Place.</L>
<L><HI>Possum</HI> did to the utmost he was able,</L>
<L>And bore as Stout as if he'd been A <HI>Table.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Volo</HI> was willing, <HI>Nolo</HI> some-what stout,</L>
<L>But <HI>Malo</HI> rather chose, not to stand out.</L>
<L><HI>Possum</HI> and <HI>Volo</HI> wish'd all might afford</L>
<L>Their help, but had not an <HI>Imperative Word.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Edo</HI> from Service would by no means Swerve</L>
<L>Rather than fail, he thought the <HI>Cakes</HI> to Serve.</L>
<L><HI>Fio</HI> was taken in a fit, and said,</L>
<L>By him a Mournful <HI>POEM</HI> should be made.</L>
<L><HI>Fero</HI> was willing for to bear a part,</L>
<L>Altho' he did it with an aking heart.</L>
<L><HI>Feror</HI> excus'd, with grief he was so Torn,</L>
<L>He could not bear, he needed to be born.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such <HI>Nouns</HI> and <HI>Verbs</HI> as we defective find</L>
<L>No <HI>Grammar</HI> Rule did their attendance bind.</L>
<L>They were excepted, and exempted hence,</L>
<L>But <HI>Supines,</HI> all did blame for negligence.</L>
<L><HI>Verbs</HI> Offspring, <HI>Participles</HI> hand-in-hand,</L>
<L>Follow, and by the same direction stand:</L>
<L>The rest Promiscuously did croud and cumber,</L>
<L>Such Multitudes of each, they wanted Number.</L>
<L>Next to the Corps to make th' attendance even,</L>
<L><HI>Jove, Mercury, Apollo</HI> came from heaven.</L>
<L>And <HI>Virgil, Cato,</HI> gods, men, Rivers, Winds,</L>
<L>With <HI>Elegies,</HI> Tears, Sighs, came in their kinds.</L>
<L><HI>Ovid</HI> from <HI>Pontus</HI> hast's Apparrell'd thus,</L>
<L>In Exile-weeds bringing <HI>De Tristibus:</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Homer</HI> sure had been among the Rout,</L>
<L>But that the Stories say his Eyes were out.</L>
<L><HI>Queens, Cities, Countries, Islands,</HI> Come</L>
<L>All Trees, Birds, Fishes, and each Word in <HI>Um.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What <HI>Syntax</HI> here can you expect to find?</L>
<L>Where each one bears such discomposed mind.</L>
<L>Figures of Diction and Construction,</L>
<L>Do little: Yet stand sadly looking on.</L>
<L>That such a Train may in their motion <HI>chord,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Prosodia</HI> gives the measure Word for Word.</L>
