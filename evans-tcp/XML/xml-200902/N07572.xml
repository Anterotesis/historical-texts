<HEAD>A LETTER TO A FRIEND in the COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 12, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Apology was unnecessary. It will be no <HI>Trouble,</HI> but a <HI>Pleasure,</HI> if I can give you the Satisfaction you desire. I shall therefore immediately communicate to you my Motives for approving the Proposal of endeavouring to obtain a <HI>Royal Government,</HI> in Exchange for this of the Proprietaries; with such Answers to the Objections you mention, as, in my Opinion, fully obviate them.</P>
<P>I do not purpose entering into the Merits of the Disputes between the Proprietaries and the People: I only observe it as a Fact known to us all, that such Disputes there are, and that they
<PB N="3" REF="009664_0003_0F77882EDEA7F620"/>
have long subsisted, greatly to the Prejudice of the Province, clogging and embarrassing all the Wheels of Government, and exceedingly ob∣structing the publick Defence, and the Measures wisely concerted by our Gracious Sovereign, for the common Security of the Colonies. I may add it as another Fact, that <HI>we are all heartily tired of these Disputes.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that Disputes of the same Kind have arisen in ALL Proprietary Go∣vernments, and subsisted till their Dissolution; All were made unhappy by them, and found no Relief but in recurring finally to the immediate Government of the Crown. <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Ma∣ryland,</HI> are the only Two of the Kind remaining, and both at this Instant agitated by the same Con∣tentions between Proprietary Interest and Power, and Popular Liberty. Thro' these Contentions the good People of that Province are rendered equally unhappy with our selves, and their Pro∣prietary, perhaps, more so than our's; for he has no <HI>Quakers</HI> in his Assembly to saddle with the Blame of those Contentions, nor can he justify himself with the Pretence, that turning to the Church has made his People his Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Pennsylvania</HI> had scarce been settled Twenty Years, when these Disputes began between the first Proprietor and the original Settlers; they continued, with some Intermissions, during his whole Life;— his Widow took them up, and continued them after his Death. Her Sons re∣sum'd
<PB N="4" REF="009664_0004_0F77882F9AAF5450"/>
them very early, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See their Message to the Assembly, in which the Right of sitting on their own Adjournments is denied.</NOTE> and they still subsist. —Mischievous and distressing as they have been found to both Proprietors and People, it does not appear that there is any Prospect of their being extinguish'd, till either the Proprietary Purse is unable to support them, or the Spirit of the Peo∣ple so broken, that they shall be willing to sub∣mit to any Thing, rather than continue them. The first is not very likely to happen, as that immense Estate goes on increasing.</P>
<P>Considering all Circumstances, I am at length inclin'd to think, that the Cause of these mise∣rable Contentions is not to be sought for merely in the Depravity and Selfishness of human Minds. For tho' it is not unlikely that in these, as well as in other Disputes, there are <HI>Faults on both Sides,</HI> every glowing Coal being apt to inflame its Op∣posite; yet I see no Reason to suppose that all Pro∣prietary Rulers are worse Men than other Rulers, nor that all People in Proprietary Governments are worse People than those in other Govern∣ments. I suspect therefore, that the Cause is radi∣cal, interwoven in the Constitution, and so be∣come of the very Nature, of Proprietary Govern∣ments; and will therefore produce its Effects, as long as such Governments continue.—And, as some Physicians say, every Animal Body brings into the World among its original Stamina, the
<PB N="5" REF="009664_0005_0F7788305EC51B10"/>
Seeds of that Disease that shall finally produce its Dissolution; so the Political Body of a Proprie∣tary Government, contains those convulsive Prin∣ciples that will at length destroy it.</P>
<P>I may not be Philosopher enough to develop those Principles, nor would this Letter afford me Room, if I had Abilities, for such a Discussion. The <HI>Fact</HI> seems sufficient for our Purpose, and the <HI>Fact</HI> is notorious, that such Contentions have been in all Proprietary Governments, and have brought, or are now bringing, them all to a Conclusion.— I will only mention one Parti∣cular common to them all. Proprietaries must have a Multitude of private Accounts and Deal∣ings with almost all the People of their Provinces, either for Purchase-money or Quit-rents. Deal∣ings often occasion Differences, and Differences produce mutual Opinions of Injustice. If Pro∣prietaries do not insist on small Rights, they must on the Whole lose large Sums; and if they do insist on small Rights, they seem to descend, their Dignity suffers in the Opinion of the Peo∣ple, and with it the Respect necessary to keep up the Authority of Government.—The People, who think themselves injured in Point of Property, are discontented with the Government, and grow tur∣bulent; and the Proprietaries using their Powers of Government to procure for themselves what they think Justice in their Points of Property, ren∣ders those Powers odious.— I suspect this has had no small Share in producing the Confusions inci∣dent
<PB N="6" REF="009664_0006_0F7788310EB31B78"/>
to those Governments.—They appear, how∣ever, to be, <HI>of all others,</HI> the most unhappy.</P>
<P>At present we are in a wretched Situation. The Government that ought to keep all in Order is itself weak, and has scarce Authority enough to keep the common Peace. Mobs assemble and kill (we scarce dare say <HI>murder</HI>) Numbers of in∣nocent People in cold Blood, who were under the Protection of the Government. Proclamations are issued to bring the Rioters to Justice. Those Proclamations are treated with the utmost In∣dignity and Contempt. Not a Magistrate dares wag a Finger towards discovering or apprehend∣ing, the <HI>Delinquents,</HI> (we must not call them <HI>Murderers</HI>). They assemble again, and with Arms in their Hands, approach the Capital.— The Government truckles, condescends to cajole them, and drops all Prosecution of their Crimes; whilst honest Citizens, threatened in their Lives and Fortunes, flie the Province, as having no Confidence in the Publick Protection. We are daily threatened with more of these Tumults; and the Government, which in its Distress call'd aloud on the sober Inhabitants to come with Arms to its Assistance, now sees those who afford∣ed that Assistance daily libell'd, abus'd, and me∣nac'd by its Partizans for so doing; whence it has little Reason to expect such Assistance on another Occasion:—In this Situation, what is to be done? By what Means is that Harmony between the two Branches of Government to be obtain'd, without which the internal Peace of the Province can not
<PB N="7" REF="009664_0007_0F778831DA2924C0"/>
be well secured? One Project is, to turn all <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> out of the Assembly; or, by obtaining more Members for the Back Counties, to get a Majority in, who are not <HI>Quakers.</HI>—This, perhaps, is not very difficult to do; and more Members for those Counties may, on other Accounts, be proper; but I much question if it would answer this End, as I see among the Members, that those who are not <HI>Quakers,</HI> and even those from the Back Counties, are as hearty and unanimous in opposing what they think Proprietary Injustice, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves, if not more so.—Religion has hap∣pily nothing to do with our present Differences, tho' great Pains is taken to lug it into the Squab∣ble.—And even were the <HI>Quakers</HI> extirpated, I doubt whether the Proprietaries, while they pur∣sue the same Measures, would be a Whit more at their Ease.—Another Project is, to chuse none for Assembly-men but such as are Friends to the Proprietaries.—The Number of Members is not so great, but that I believe this Scheme may be practicable, if you look for Representa∣tives among Proprietary Officers and Depend∣ants. Undoubtedly it would produce great Harmony between Governor and Assembly: But how would both of them agree with the Peo∣ple? Their Principles and Conduct must greatly change, if they would be elected a second Year. But that might be needless. Six Parts in Seven agreeing with the Governor, could make the House perpetual. This, however, would not
<PB N="8" REF="009664_0008_0F7788329427B6B8"/>
probably establish Peace in the Province. The Quarrel the People now have with the Proprie∣taries, would then be with both the Proprietaries and Assembly. — There seems to remain then but one Remedy for our Evils, a Remedy approved by Experience, and which has been tried with Success by other Provinces; I mean that of an immediate ROYAL GOVERNMENT, without the Intervention of Proprietary Powers, which, like unnecessary Springs and Movements in a Machine, are so apt to produce Disorder.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that the Proposal of a Change like this, should meet with no Objections. —Those you have mention'd to me concerning Liberty of Conscience and the Privileges of Dis∣senters, are, however, not difficult to answer; as they seem to arise merely from want of Infor∣mation, or Acquaintance with the State of other Colonies, before and after such Changes had been made in their Government. <HI>Carolina</HI> and the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> were formerly Proprietary Govern∣ments, but now immediately under the Crown; and their Cases had many Circumstances similar to ours.—Of the First we are told,</P>
<P><Q>There was a natural Infirmity in the Policy of their Charter, which was the Source of many of the Misfortunes of the Colony, with∣out any Imputation on the noble Families con∣cern'd. For the Grantees, [the Proprietors] being eight in Number, and not incorporated, and no Provision being made to conclude the
<PB N="9" REF="009664_0009_0F7788335B64EC98"/>
whole Number by the Voices of the Majority, there could not be timely Measures always agreed on, which were proper or necessary for the good Government of the Plantation. In the mean Time the Inhabitants grew unruly and quarrelled about Religion and Politicks, and while there was a mere Anarchy among them, they were expos'd to the Attacks and Insults of their <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Neighbours, whom they had imprudently provok'd and in∣jur'd;— and as if they had conspir'd against the Growth of the Colony, they repealed their Laws for Liberty of Conscience, though the Majority of the People were Dissenters, and had resorted thither under the publick Faith for a compleat Indulgence, which they consi∣dered as Part of their <HI>Magna Charta.</HI>— With∣in these four Years an End was put to their Sorrows; for about that Time, the Lords Proprietors and the Planters, (who had long been heartily tir'd of each other) were, by the Interposition of the Legislature, fairly divorc∣ed for ever, and the Property of the Whole vested in the Crown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New and accurate Account of <HI>Carolina,</HI> p. <HI>14.</HI> Printed at <HI>London, 1733.</HI></NOTE></Q> And the above-men∣tion'd injudicious and unjust Act, against the Privileges of Dissenters, was repeal'd by the King in Council.</P>
<P>Another Historian tells us, <Q>Their intestine Distractions, and their foreign Wars, kept
<PB N="10" REF="009664_0010_0F778834119AE5A0"/>
the Colony so low, that an Act of Parliament, if possible to prevent the last ruinous Conse∣quences of these Divisions, put the Province under the immediate Care and Inspection of the Crown. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Account of the <HI>British</HI> Settlements in <HI>America.</HI> Page <HI>23</HI> concerning <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And Governor JOHNSON, at his first meeting the Assembly there, after the Change, tells them,</P>
<P><Q>His Majesty, out of his great Goodness and Fatherly Care of you, and at the earnest Re∣quest and Solicitation of your selves, has been graciously pleased, at a great Expence, to purchase seven Eighths of the late Lords Pro∣prietaries Charter, whereby you are become under his immediate Government; a BLESS∣ING and SECURITY we have been <HI>long praying for,</HI> and solicitous of; the <HI>good Effects</HI> of which we <HI>daily experience</HI> by the <HI>Safety</HI> we en∣joy, as well in our Trade, by the Protection of his Ships of War, as by Land, by an Indepen∣dant Company maintain'd purely for our Safe∣ty and Encouragement. The taking off the E∣numeration of Rice, is a peculiar Favour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HISTORICAL REGISTER, No. 63, for 173.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>By these Accounts we learn, that the People of that Province, far from losing by the Change, obtain'd internal Security and external Protec∣tion, both by Sea and Land; the Dissenters a Restoration and Establishment of their Privi∣leges,
<PB N="11" REF="009664_0011_0F778834D0685528"/>
which the Proprietary Government at∣tempted to deprive them of; and the whole Province, Favours in point of Trade with re∣spect to their grand Staple Commodity, which from that Time they were allowed to carry di∣rectly to foreign Ports, without being oblig'd, as before, to enter in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the neighbouring Province of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> we find, in a Representation from the Board of Trade to the Crown, dated <HI>White∣hall, Oct.</HI> 2▪ 1701. the following Account of it, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the Inhabitants in a Petition to his Majesty the last Year, complained of several Grievances they lay under by the Neglect or Mismanagement of the Proprietors of that Province, or their Agents;— unto which they also added, that during the whole Time the said Proprietors have govern'd, or pre∣tended to govern, that Province, they have never taken care to preserve or defend the same from the <HI>Indians,</HI> or other Enemies, by <HI>sending</HI> or <HI>providing</HI> any Arms, Ammunition or Stores, <HI>as they ought to have done;</HI> and the said Inhabitants thereupon humbly prayed, his Majesty would be pleased to commissionate some fit Person, to be Governor over them. —That it has been represented to us by se∣veral Letters, Memorials, and other Papers, as well from the Inhabitants as Proprietors, that they are at present in <HI>Confusion</HI> and <HI>Anar∣chy,</HI> and that it is much to be apprehended, lest by the Heats of the Parties that are amongst
<PB N="12" REF="009664_0012_0F778835931D0D18"/>
them, they should fall into such Violences, may endanger the Lives of many Persons and destroy the Colony.</Q> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grants</HI> and <HI>Concessions,</HI> and <HI>original Constitutions</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> printed at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> by <HI>W.

<P><HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> lost i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Charter in the latter End of King CHARLES Reign, when the Charters of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> were seized. At the Re¦volution the Crown gave them a better Constitu¦tion, which they enjoy to this Day: No Advan¦tages were taken against the Privileges of the People, tho' then universally <HI>Dissenters.</HI> The same Privileges are enjoyd by the Dissenters in <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> which has been a Royal Go¦vernment ever since 1679, when the Freeholder and Inhabitants petition'd to be taken under the
<PB N="15" REF="009664_0015_0F778838267CD438"/>
immediate Protection of the Crown.— Nor is there existing in any of the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, any <HI>Test</HI> imposed by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to exclude <HI>Dissenters</HI> from Offices. In some Colonies, in∣deed, where the Episcopalians and in others the Dissenters, have been predominant, they have made partial Laws in favour of their re∣spective Sects, and lay'd some Difficulties on the others; but those Laws have been, generally, on Complaint, repealed at home.</P>
<P>It is farther objected, you tell me, that <HI>if we have a Royal Government, we must have with it a Bishop, and a Spiritual Court, and must pay Tythes to support an Episcopal Clergy.</HI> A Bishop for <HI>America</HI> has been long talk'd of in <HI>England,</HI> and probably from the apparent Necessity of the Thing, will sooner or later be appointed; because a Voyage to <HI>England</HI> for Ordination is extream∣ly inconvenient and expensive to the young Clergy educated in <HI>America;</HI> and the Episcopal Churches and Clergy in these Colonies cannot so conveniently be governed and regulated by a Bishop residing in <HI>England,</HI> as by one residing among these committed to his Care. But this Event will happen neither sooner nor later for our being, or not being, under a Royal Govern∣ment. And the Spiritual Court, if the Bishop should hold one, can have Authority only with his own People, if with them, since it is not likely that any Law of this Province will ever be made to submit the Inhabitants to it, or oblige them to pay Tithes; and without such
<PB N="16" REF="009664_0016_0F7788389206AF60"/>
Law, Tithes can no more be demanded here than they are in any other Colony; and there is not a single Instance of <HI>Tithes</HI> demanded or paid in any Part of <HI>America.</HI> A Maintenance has, indeed, been established in some Colonies, for the Episcopal Clergy; as in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a Royal Government; and in <HI>Maryland,</HI> a Proprietary Government: But this was done by Acts of their own, which they were not oblig'd to make if they did not chuse it.</P>
<P>That <HI>we shall have a standing Army to main∣tain,</HI> is another Bugbear rais'd to terrify us from endeavouring to obtain a King's Government. It is very possible that the Crown may think it necessary to keep Troops in <HI>America</HI> hencefor∣ward, to maintain its Conquests, and defend the Colonies; and that the Parliament may establish some Revenue arising out of the American Trade to be apply'd towards supporting those Troops. It is possible too, that we may, after a few Years Experience, be generally very well satisfy'd with that Measure, from the steady Pro∣tection it will afford us against Foreign Ene∣mies, and the Security of internal Peace among ourselves without the Expence or Trouble of a Militia. But assure yourself, my Friend, that whether we like it or not, our continuing under a Proprietary Government will not prevent it, nor our coming under a Royal Government promote and forward it, any more than they would prevent or procure Rain or Sunshine.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009664_0017_0F77883956D1C818"/>The other Objections you have communicated to me, are, that <HI>in case of a Change of Proprietary for Royal Government, our Judges and other Officers will be appointed and sent us from</HI> England; <HI>we must have a Legislative Council; our Assembly will lose the Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments, we shall lose the Right of chusing Sheriffs, and annual Assemblies, and of voting by Ballot.</HI> I shall not en∣ter into the Question, whether Judges from <HI>England</HI> would probably be of Advantage or Disadvantage to our Law Proceedings. It is needless, as the Power of appointing them is given to the Governor here, by a Law that has receiv'd the Royal Assent, the <HI>Act for esta∣blishing Courts.</HI> The King's Governor only comes in Place of a Proprietary Governor; he must (if the Change is made) take the Govern∣ment as he finds it. He can alter nothing. The same Answer serves for all the subsequent Objections. A Legislative Council under pro∣per Regulations might perhaps be an Amend∣ment of our Constitution, but it cannot take Place without our Consent, as our Constitution is otherwise establish'd; nor can our Assembly lose the <HI>Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments;</HI> nor the People that of <HI>chusing Sheriffs, and annu∣al Assemblies,</HI> or of <HI>Voting by Ballot.</HI> These Rights being all confirm'd by Acts of Assembly assented to by the Crown. I mean the Acts entit∣led <HI>An Act to ascertain the Number of Members of Assembly and to regulate the Elections;</HI> and <HI>An Act for Regulating the Elections of Sheriffs and Coron∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
<PB N="18" REF="009664_0018_0F77883A1A7AE670"/>
both past in the 4th of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> I know it has been asserted, to intimidate us, that those Acts, so far from being approved by the Crown, were never presented. But I can assure you, from good Authority, that they, with forty-eight others. (all pass'd at the same Time by Governor <HI>Evans,</HI>) were duly laid before the Queen in Council; who on the 28th of <HI>April</HI> 1709 referred the same to the Board of Trade. The Board on the 8th of <HI>September</HI> 1709, re∣ported upon the said Fifty Acts, that they had considered the same, and had taken the Opinion of the Attorney General upon several of them in point of Law; and they represented against Six of them, as unfit to be continued in force; but as to the other forty-four, the Titles of which are given at large, and among them the two <HI>material Acts</HI> above mentioned, they had <HI>no Objection</HI> to the same. Whereupon there issued two Orders of the Queen in Council both dated at the Court at <HI>Windsor,</HI> the 24th of <HI>October</HI> 1709, one repealing the Six Laws objected to; and the other, ap∣proving the remaining Forty-four. This is a Fact that you may depend upon. There is therefore nothing now that can deprive us of those Privileges but an Act of Parliament; and we may rely on the united Justice of King, Lords, and Commons, that no such Act will ever pass, while we continue loyal and dutiful Subjects. An Act of Assembly, indeed may give them up; but I trust, urgent as they are
<PB N="19" REF="009664_0019_0F77883E77CF5E68"/>
for Admission, we shall never see Proprietary Friends enow in the House, to make that detes∣table Sacrifice.</P>
<P>In fine, it does not appear to me, that this <HI>Change of Government</HI> can possibly hurt us; and I see many Advantages that may flow from it. The Expression, <HI>Change of Government,</HI> seems, in∣deed, to be too extensive; and is apt to give the Idea of a general and total Change of our Laws and Constitution. It is rather and only a <HI>Change of Governor,</HI> that is, instead of self-interested Proprietaries, a gracious King! His Majesty who has no Views but for the Good of the People will thenceforth appoint the Governor, who, un∣shackled by Proprietary Instructions, will be at Liberty to join with the Assembly in enacting wholesome Laws. At present, when the King requires Supplies of his faithful Subjects, and they are willing and desirous to grant them, the Proprietaries intervene and say, <HI>unless our private Interests in certain Particulars are served,</HI> NO∣THING SHALL BE DONE. This insolent Tribuni∣tial VETO, has long encumbered all our Pu∣blick Affairs, and been productive of many Mis∣chiefs.

<P>On the whole, I cannot but think, the more the Proposal is considered, of <HI>an humble Petition to the</HI> KING, <HI>to take this Province under his Ma∣jesty's immediate Protection and Government,</HI> the more unanimously we shall go into it. We are chiefly People of <HI>three Countries: British</HI> Spirits can no longer bear the Treatment they have recei∣ved, nor will they put on the Chains prepared for them by a Fellow Subject. And the <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> have felt too severely the Oppres∣sions of <HI>hard-hearted Landlords</HI> and <HI>arbitrary Princes,</HI> to wish to see, in the Proprietaries of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> both the one and the other united.</P>
