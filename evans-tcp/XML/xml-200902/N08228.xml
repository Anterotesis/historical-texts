<HEAD>To them who desired the following Publication.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ensuing Discourse makes its Appearance in Compliance with your repeated Solicitations; and not from any Fondness in me to commence Author. Neither had I the most distant Expectation when preparing for the Pulpit, that it would ever be called for after You had heard it. I therefore thought it necessary, in transcribing for the Press, to make con∣siderable Enlargements; for which I persuade myself I need make no Apology.</P>
<P>The Extasy which this good News occasioned, a∣mong all Ranks of People, as soon as certainly known; compared with that awful Indifference, with which the glad Tidings of Salvation are heard by our Inha∣bitants in general; at once suggested to me the Expe∣diency of attempting to improve it in this spiritual Manner.</P>
<P>I would therefore with all Humility, lay this small Performance at the Feet of Jesus, who is exalted as Head over all Things to the Church; and who can, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings perfect Praise. And remain,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>HOULD I serve you a century in the gospel of Christ, I might never again have so favourable an op∣portunity to consider this passage. It is a proverb, the truth of which you are now feeling: Hence great is the propriety of improving its spiritual mean∣ing. And the preacher will have the advantage, while he attempts to illustrate the glories of the gospel, by what the people feel. Has not a ge∣neral joy diffused itself amongst us? Does not Boston and the country wear a face of pleasant∣ness?
<PB N="6" REF="010503_0005_0F8018567208F9A8"/>
You may read good news in every counte∣nance. How great the alteration, that has taken place amongst us, in consequence of a late most interesting decision in our favour! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act.</NOTE> When the news arrived, so as to be confidently believed, there was a universal shout.—It now became im∣possible for every lover of liberty and his country, to conceal the gladness of his heart: Public and private were the expressions of joy on this im∣portant occasion! Yea your children, yet igno∣rant of the importance of this event to these colonies, bear a part in the triumphs of the day; in imitation, no doubt, of their parents and o∣thers, whom they observe pleased on this happy occurrence. Well thought I, will good news from an earthly Prince, that brings deliverance, and gives us the prospect of the continuance of our most dear and invaluable rights and privi∣leges, which we apprehended on the brink of departing from us; fill us with such a general gladness, that scarce a tongue will be silent?— Oh how much more might we expect that the glad tidings of salvation; salvation from ever∣lasting misery, to the fruition of endless happiness, would diffuse a universal joy!—How justly might we look for the tongue of the dumb to sing — for the stammerer to speak plainly; and for the mouths of babes and sucklings, to help on the exalted tribute of praise to Him, who hath com∣mitted to men the ministry of reconciliation; de∣claring <HI>peace on earth, good will towards men?</HI> But alas, such is the carnality of the heart of man, that though soon elated with temporal deliver∣ance;
<PB N="7" REF="010503_0006_0F8018572C1504D8"/>
he is blind to, and too little affected with the <HI>great salvation!</HI> What means this strange conduct? The one is believed with a warm heart; the other seems to the poor sinner as an idle tale, and he believes it not! Surely "the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that be∣lieve not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.4.</NOTE></P>
<P>AGAIN. Do I observe both the righteous, and the wicked rejoicing on this occasion? Yes: And let me add, good reason they have to do so. But on the other, though infinitely more important, even the righteous themselves are shamefully neg∣ligent, and lukewarm.—Do I see the children in the streets exulting in this good news from a far country? Oh thought I that this news of re∣demption thro' our Lord Jesus Christ, might be so gladly, and generally received; and become so powerful in its influence on parents and heads of families, that their lives and conversations, might sweetly constrain their little ones to join that triumphant <HI>"Hosanna to the Son of David,"</HI> Mat. 21.15.—But why should we wonder if the children withhold the tribute of praise, when the parents themselves are sinfully silent?</P>
<P>ARE we tenacious of our rights and liberties? And do we fear every thing that looks like an infringment? What think we then of our con∣duct towards Him, who is the only Potentate? How often have we been for wresting the go∣vernment
<PB N="8" REF="010503_0007_0F80185993D1AB60"/>
from Him, and have practically said, <HI>"We will not have the Lord to reign over us?"</HI> Is not Jehovah tender of his honour? His glory he will never give to another. He may say to us, "Ye have robbed me." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3.8.</NOTE> Numerous have been our provocations against Him; and if he had entred into judgment with us, we should have been cut off in our iniquity, and forever confined with the spirits in prison. But lo, here is good news from a far country, a "God in Christ re∣conciling the world to himself!"—A method of salvation, exhibited in the gospel, that effectually secures the honours of the divine government, and the harmony of Jehovah's attributes; while the chief of sinners are made heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ! "As cold waters to a thirsty soul: so is this good news from a far country." <Q>The proverbial sense (says Dr. Jermin) is, That what is gotten by hard la∣bour, and after much time spent upon it, being as it were fetched from a far country, is most delightful being obtained. But to make use of the verse in a more spiritual application: The farthest country that lies any where is heaven: And the good news are the tidings of the gos∣pel.</Q> In this spiritual manner, I shall, thro' di∣vine assistance, improve the text. And,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. OBSERVE, That we have news from hea∣ven; a far country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. CONSIDER by what means this news has been conveyed to us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="010503_0008_0F80185A935BA870"/>III. THAT it is "news" indeed; and empha∣tically "good news."</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT this good news from heaven, is more welcome to a heavy laden sinner, and a true believer thirsting after God, than cold waters are to any one athirst.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST, We have news from heaven, a far coun∣try. It is not uncommon in the sacred writings, to speak of heaven as a country: "But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.16.</NOTE> In which chapter, the same word is repeated, to signify, that the believing Hebrews were in the pursuit of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>NOW the news we have from thence, the apostle Paul epitomizes, in writing to his Son Timothy, of the exceeding riches of the grace of God in his conversion, and call to the apostleship: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.15.</NOTE> I ask you, as Christ did the Jews of John's baptism, Is this news from heaven, or of men?—You will readily answer, methinks, from heaven. From heaven it is, my Brethren.</P>
<P N="1">I. AS it was there this glorious scheme of re∣demption was concluded on, the subjects of it cho∣sen, and all the certain means of its execution deter∣mined. There it originated, and from thence it came. The covenant of grace bears an antient
<PB N="10" REF="010503_0009_0F80185B9454D580"/>
date, even from eternity: Tho' the dispensation of it is late, since man's apostacy. Hence when Paul preached to the Ephesians, the unsearchable riches of Christ, he lets them know, that his call to the ministry, and the gospel he delivered, were "according to God's eternal purpose, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. 3.11.</NOTE> And in this same epistle, he speaks of our having been "chosen in Christ, before the foundation of the world." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. 1.4.</NOTE> Various are the passages of holy scripture, that lead us to contemplate this <HI>counsel of peace,</HI> in eter∣nity; before the world began. Then this ever∣lasting covenant, was well ordered in all things and sure. Jesus Christ was chosen by the Father, as the head of it; the heirs of promise were chosen in Him, and given to him as members of it; the means of their preservation, effectual calling, and perfect sanctification, were appointed. In short, no part of it was left precarious; it being an ab∣solute covenant. <Q>If the covenant of grace (says one) were not absolute, salvation would be as difficult by it, as by the covenant of works; be∣cause it is as hard for a natural man to believe and live, as it is for him to do and live.</Q> This great truth, which appears to me to shine with dis∣tinguished brightness, in the holy Bible, is full of solid comfort to the pious soul; an article of high importance in the church of Christ; and when rightly understood, has a most powerful influence on the believer's practice. So far as I have had time, and opportunity to observe, I am led to con∣clude, That a deviation from this and the other glorious doctrines, that are connected with it, has
<PB N="11" REF="010503_0010_0F80185BB3510DF0"/>
generally been attended with a decay of vital religion. Its having been opposed is not strange: For you may be confident, that nothing short of divine influence, can bring a sinner to fall in with, and really to submit to the sovereignty of God. A maxim that men have adopted, and which they warmly plead for with regard to them∣selves; they will not acknowledge when applied to the God of the spirits of all flesh, viz. "That every one may do what he will with his own." But notwithstanding the different sentiments of man∣kind as to this point; you will bear with me, while I say, That I believe it to be a doctrine from heaven.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is from heaven, as the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the author of this salvation, is from thence. "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 16.28.</NOTE> Which I suppose is to be un∣derstood of Christ, his assuming human nature: Or his appearing in that body, that had been prepared for him. "A body hast thou pre∣pared me" <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.5.</NOTE> And this assumption of our na∣ture was in the fulness of time. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.4.</NOTE> i. e. the time appointed in eternity. This coming forth from the Father, can only hold true of Christ as medi∣ator; as also where it is said, "That God sent him." As God, he fills all places at the same time; and therefore can neither be said to go nor come. Neither as God can he be sent; for then God must send God. i. e. He must send himself. This is unintelligible. But as mediator, he is sent: In this character he came forth from the Father,
<PB N="12" REF="010503_0011_0F80185C76312B40"/>
and came into the world, when he became openly incarnate.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps an objection will be started—"If the Son of God can only be said to be sent, as con∣sidered in human nature; how is it that the same phrase is used of the Holy Ghost; who, as you say, is God equal with the Father and the Son; and never appeared in an assumed nature, but re∣mains a pure, infinite spirit?" For an answer to this objection, I freely give credit to the learned and pious Mr. Hussey. <Q>The Spirit's mission (says he) is not as the spirit is God, it is not abstract∣edly God the spirit; for the Holy Ghost could not be sent or come from the Father thus, because as an infinite person, he doth together with the Father and the Son, fill all places at once, and so as the Spirit is God, must not be said to go from one place to another, but it is as Comforter that he doth so. He doth not fill all the world as Comforter, but it is as God the Spirit that he fills all the world.</Q> I observe, my hearers, when Christ promised the Spirit, and said he would send him, it was under the character of Comforter. "I will send you another Comforter."—"If I go not away, the Comforter will not come." Thus mak∣ing a distinction between his office, and his essence. As the same author says, <Q>He is not given in his essence, but in his office, as the immediate cause of our obtaining the graces of the spirit.</Q> Here∣by we know that <Q>he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us, 1 John 3.24. Here is his person in the office of a Comforter.</Q> Again. <Q>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he
<PB N="13" REF="010503_0012_0F80185D47809BC8"/>
in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit, 1 John 14.3. There are the graces of the spirit, and both put together do make up the full distinction in the two branches of it as laid down above.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hussey's Glory of Christ unveil'd.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS the objection is answered, while we distin∣guish the office of the Holy Ghost, from his essence as God. He was sent as a Paraclete or Comforter, but not as God the Spirit.</P>
<P>I MIGHT go on to observe, that Jesus Christ made it evident, that he was from heaven, by the kingdom he set up in the world. His appearance among men; making himself of no reputation, and taking upon him the form of a servant: The com∣pany he kept of choice, who were not the rich, and noble, but poor and despised; oblige us to think "his kingdom is not of this world." If he had had in view, a worldly kingdom, depend upon it, he would have proceeded according to worldly maxims. But so far from this, that he treated the riches, the honours, and glories of this world, with manifest indifference. The meanness of his birth and parentage, at once rendred him the object of contempt: The men he chose to be his disciples and followers, were so contemptible in the eyes of the Jews; that he could expect nothing but in∣dignity in consequence thereof. Yet this gave him no concern; because he came into the world to establish a spiritual kingdom. And he had no∣thing to hope for; neither had he any thing to fear, from the men of this world, but what he foresaw, and was able to prevent; provided it would not issue in the advancement of this his kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010503_0013_0F80185DED264DC8"/>HOWEVER the Jews found fault with Christ, de∣spised him and set him at naught on this account; you christians see a coincidence between every part of his <HI>conduct,</HI> and his <HI>design</HI> to establish a spiri∣tual kingdom. From the beginning of his life, to the end of it, he constantly convinced us, that he came not to seek the favour and honours of men. And as to his disciples, they willingly left all to follow him; risqued their lives in the pro∣motion of his divine religion; and gave repeated, indisputable evidences that "by patient continu∣ance in well-doing, they sought for glory, and im∣mortality; eternal life." "They reckoned that the sufferings of this present time, were not worthy to be compared with the glory that should be re∣vealed in them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.18.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. WHILE we consider the doctrines them∣selves; their special influence on the heart and life; and the glorious prospect they give us be∣yond the grave; we are confident they are from heaven.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE doctrines themselves: Such as a Trinity of persons, in the unity of the divine essence—The incarnation of Jesus Christ—Justification by faith: Or righteousness imputed without works. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.6.</NOTE> The descent of the Holy Ghost, and his powerful energy in changing the sinner's heart, and carrying on the work of sanctification in believers: The in∣dwelling of this Holy Spirit, together with his bearing witness with the believer's spirit, that he is a child of God; and thus sweetly sealing him unto
<PB N="15" REF="010503_0014_0F80185EB0B0B8C0"/>
the day of redemption. These, and many other great and precious truths, which it never en<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d into the heart of man to conceive, till they were set before us in the gospel, demand our faith. Their importance, &amp; sublimity, will at once strike the devout mind; and he readily acknowledge they bear a divine signature. I think I may safely say, They never would have been thought of by men, if they had not been revealed in the gospel; it be∣ing absolutely impossible, that man should invent, what he could not afterward fully comprehend: Which is particularly true of the doctrine of the Trinity, and the incarnation of the Son of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS gospel has a special influence on the heart, and life. It begins with the heart; laying the ax to the root of the tree. "It comes with power, the Holy Ghost, and much assurance." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. 1.5.</NOTE> Hence the man becomes a new creature, old things pass away, and all things become new. The na∣tural enmity is slain, and the image of Christ form∣ed in the soul. This great change is called rege∣neration: And in whomsoever it is wrought, there are new apprehensions of divine things—new feel∣ings—"Joy and peace in believing."—There will also be a different conduct. "The grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men; teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2.11, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE is no part of a christian's conduct, while he acts in that character, but what is under the
<PB N="16" REF="010503_0015_0F80185F6CA57568"/>
influence of this gospel. It influentially inclines him to the whole of his duty; to pay an unreser∣ved obedience to every divine precept: In a word, <HI>To do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</HI></P>
<P>ITS special influence also on the believer's mind, at once discovers that it is of divine origin. How does it raise his affections from this world, and fix them on things above? He will have his conversation in heaven, and dwell on high. For this gospel immediately tends to make him spiri∣tually minded. That high relish, with which he formerly grasped after the things of time, subsides, in consequence of his feeling the power of the gos∣pel of Christ. Such an one sees that God is his portion; that Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega of his happiness; that heaven is his home! Here then will his captivated soul rest infinitely satisfied; and the world appear as a very little thing. For at the same time that the gospel leads the believer to soar above created good; it also, in the hands of the divine Spirit, promotes his "meetness for the enjoyment of the inheritance of the saints in light." And this it does, as it sets before him the infinite evil of sin; making it appear "exceeding sinful:" The intrinsic beauty of holiness; which as it is essential to God, so, to every devout soul, it is a pleasing part of the divine character. The former he abhors, and groans under; the latter he longs for, and follows after. Yea so fervent, and incessant are the desires of the heaven-born-soul, that he cannot be contented while there are the smallest remains of sin in him: Nothing will satisfy him short of perfect holiness.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010503_0016_0F8018605B226558"/>WELL my Brethren, as this is the tendency of our gospel, sure we are that it came down from heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE will add to the above considerations, the glorious prospect the gospel gives us beyond the grave. Without this "good news" from heaven, death would indeed be a <HI>leap in the dark.</HI> "We should, as alas the heathen do, grope for the wall like the blind, and grope as if we had no eyes; we should stumble at noon-day as in the night; and be in desolate places as dead men." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 59.10.</NOTE> Consider the present state of the heathen world; which be∣ing without the gospel, is in gross darkness: While to us "the light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon us." Jesus, who came forth from the Father, "hath abolished death, and bro't life and immortality to light thro' the gospel." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 1.10.</NOTE> He hath, says this apostle, "abolished death." i. e. removed its sting, and divested the grave of all its horrors, with respect to believers, by dying &amp; rising again; and by making known to them, a state of immortal life and glory in the world to come. Reve∣lation informs us that in "God's presence there is fulness of joy, and at his right hand pleasures for evermore." <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 16.11.</NOTE> It gives us a comfortable assurance, that the souls of the righteous upon the dissolution of the body, do instantly pass to heaven. "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eccles. 12.7.</NOTE> In which words take notice, that the spirit's return to God, is connected with the return of the lifeless body to the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010503_0017_0F801861570D3AD8"/>THE view then that the righteous have of death, is no more than a change of place; a transition from a vale of tears, to the regions of endless bliss; where "the wicked cease from troubling: and where the weary be at rest" Bless God, O my soul, for this good news, that gives believers such a transporting prospect beyond the narrow limits of time! Where they "shall be with Christ, to behold his glory!" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 17.24.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">IV. I MIGHT add, That the manner in which this news has been conveyed to us, further shew∣eth us that it is from heaven, viz. By God Him∣self—by immediate inspiration—and by the mini∣stry of angels. But here I shall not enlarge, lest I anticipate what more properly belongs to the next general head. I therefore pass to consider,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, By what methods the Lord hath been pleased to make known to us his glorious gospel.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT all lay hid in the divine mind till the a∣postacy. Man's fall introduced the necessity of the recovery, and opened a door for the revelation of it. Which was first made to Adam, by God Himself, Gen. 3.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." These words are to be viewed in a twofold light, as a threatning to the serpent, and as a pro∣mise to Adam. This may appear by a short com∣ment on the verse. The "seed of the woman" no doubt designs Jesus Christ, who is said in the New
<PB N="19" REF="010503_0018_0F801861ACADE1A8"/>
Testament to be "made of a woman." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.4.</NOTE> As for the enmity spoken of, it has always been obvious, between the "seed of the woman," Christ, and all his spiritual seed believers; and the old serpent, the devil, and his seed the children of disobedience. It appeared so early as the days of Cain, who slew his brother Abel, for no other reason, but because "his own works were evil, and his brother's righ∣teous." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 3.13.</NOTE> The same spirit of opposition now reigns in the breasts of the unregenerate. It follows, "He shall bruise thy head." Christ the "seed of the woman" hath slain the old serpent, "and bruised satan under his feet." <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. 16.20.</NOTE>— Note, Christ is to bruise the head of the serpent; which intends nothing less than his absolute con∣quest over him Accordingly Paul speaks of his "destroying him that had the power of death, that is, the devil." <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>YOU also take notice, that the serpent is to "bruise his heel." To bruise the heel is not dan∣gerous; life is not at stake. From hence we learn, that at most satan can only trouble, harass and dis∣tress the children of God: Whom he shall never be able to destroy. "Because I live, said Christ, ye shall live also." <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">I have considered the heel as designing the members of Christ, who are often bruised by satan; of whom it is justly said "That he goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour." Though at the same time allowing, <Q>That the heel may rather design the human nature of Christ, which is his inferior and lowest nature, and who was in it frequently exposed to the insults, temptations and persecutions of satan, and was at last brought to a painful and accursed death; though by dying he got an entire victory over him, and all his Enemies, and obtained salvation for his people.</Q>
<BIBL>Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> in Loc.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010503_0019_0F801863E34F8148"/>THIS was the first intimation of "good news from a far country." It was afterward repeated to Abraham, Gen. 22.18. "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." After that to Isaac in the same expressions, Gen. 26.4.—Then to Jacob, Gen. 28.14. After which we find it made known to Judah, by Jacob; when in a spirit of prophecy he blessed his sons, Gen. 49.10. "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from between his feet, until SHILOH come, and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be." So we might proceed thro' the whole old testament; shewing when, by whom, and how the Lord hath made known to us this "great salva∣tion." But you, who read your Bibles, cannot, methinks be ignorant that all the prophets bore witness to the coming of the Messiah," who was to be cut off, but not for himself." David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, and the other prophets spoke concerning Jesus, as they at "sundry times were moved by the Holy Ghost." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.1.</NOTE> David foretold the manner of his death—"They pierced my hands and my feet."—Isaiah is with propriety stiled the evangelic prophet." In what moving language does he, seven hundred years before our Saviour's birth, describe his dolorous sufferings? And the nearer the time approached

for the sun of righteousness to irradiate our be∣nighted world, the clearer did the prophets express themselves.</P>
<P N="2">II. THIS "good news" was made known to us, not only by clear prophecies, but a variety of sig∣nificant types and figures. Such as, The Scape-Goat—the Brazen Serpent—the Paschal Lamb— slaying of Beasts—many Washings, &amp;c. All these things had an important meaning to the Jewish worshippers. Some of our modern Divines, have termed the Ceremonial law, the gospel of the Old Testament. The Scape-Goat was doubtless typi∣cal of Christ, and the transferring of Guilt from the elect to him. And that in so eminent a man∣ner, that he that runs may read. "And Aaron shall lay his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the chil∣dren of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabit∣ed." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. 16.21, 22.</NOTE> Here Guilt was typically transferred to the goat, which he bore away into a land not inhabited. This pointed to Christ; concerning whom Isaiah saith—"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. 53.6.</NOTE> With which agree the words of Peter, "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.24.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS for the Brazen Serpent, Jesus Christ accom∣modates it to Himself; "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John 3.14.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="010503_0021_0F801864B02E0F88"/>THE use that was made of the blood of the sa∣crifices, and their various washings, all pointed to the "blood of sprinkling;" that precious "blood that cleanseth from all sin." This part of the sub∣ject is copious, but I must not enlarge. Let these hints convince us, that Jesus Christ was held forth to the Old Testament saints by these types and figures.</P>
<P N="3">III. WHEN Christ had actually come in the flesh, the ministry of angels was employed to make it known. "And the angel said unto them, fear not: For behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.—And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 2.10—15.</NOTE> See, the angels are in extasy at the Sa∣viour's birth; though not interested in it! "This good news from a far country, was more refresh∣ing than cold waters to a thirsty soul." Good old Simeon was heard to say, "Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation: Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people: A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." Stop my soul and wonder!— Are angels all in raptures at this good news? Do they willingly descend to bring the tidings of sal∣vation; when they want no Saviour? And what is the matter with them to whom it is brought;
<PB N="23" REF="010503_0022_0F80186572F52A80"/>
and are concerned in it for life or death eternal, that they are no more affected with it?—That they are not anxious to equal angels in their praises?— Oh that we had angels tongues, and the warm heart of Simeon, then should we in heavenly strains sing "glory to God in the highest!"</P>
<P N="4">IV. WHEN Christ grew up, he entred on the ministry in person; and according to Isaiah's pro∣phecy, he went about "to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to pro∣claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that were bound." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 61.1.</NOTE> And he engaged many disciples to tread in his steps; to whom he gave commission to "go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." Who after his death, resurrection, and ascension; having received the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, went forth in his name, declaring with all boldness, That "He was the true Messiah, whom they with wicked hands had crucified, and slain." And great was the success that immediately at∣tended their faithful ministrations. "And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts 6.7.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND since the days of the apostles, the Lord hath taken care to supply his churches successively, with a number of faithful men to preach his glo∣rious gospel. "May the Lord of the harvest, send forth more labourers into his harvest!" "Faithful men that shall be able to teach others also!"</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="010503_0023_0F8018662F548038"/>THUS we see how this good news has been con∣veyed to us. We joyfully conclude from these con∣siderations, that it is from heaven. I pass to the</P>
<P>THIRD thing proposed, which is to shew that this is news indeed; and emphatically "good news."</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is news indeed, as it was never heard of, never thought of, by angels or men, till revealed. The apostle calls it, "the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coloss. 1.26.</NOTE> Who could have thought of a gracious promise of re∣demption, and forgiveness, as soon as man had sinned?—Had we not just reason to indulge a "fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery in∣dignation?"—Who could have imagined that God should "so love this guilty world, as to give his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, might not perish, but have everlasting life?" Who could have believed it, if the report were not di∣vine, that "Jesus Christ freely gave himself a ran∣som for us?"—That he assumed human nature, in order "that he might have somewhat to offer?"— That he condescended "to be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a merciful and faith∣ful high-priest, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people?"— That he obeyed the law in his life, and became obedient unto death, "even the death of the cross?"—That he laid in the grave until the third day, when he sealed his religion by rising again?— And finally, that he ascended up on high; and now, while I am preaching, and you are hearing,
<PB N="25" REF="010503_0024_0F801866EC1D9FF8"/>
he appears our advocate with the Father. "Where he ever lives to make intercession.—Oh love di∣vine!—Wisdom infinite! Who of you is not lost in these wonders of redeeming love? It is as high as heaven, what can we do? May our hearts burn within us, while we contemplate this "news" from heaven; this revelation that God hath given of his Son!</P>
<P N="2">II. This gospel is new always. You that have known the truth, twenty, thirty, forty years; yet discover fresh wonders in Christ and his salvation. The half has never been told you, of the Glory, Beauty, Fulness, Love, Compassion, of this once crucified Jesus. "He is altogether lovely, and the chiefest among ten thousand." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5.10.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. THE saints will find something new in this divine, and inexhaustible subject, when they arrive at glory. Now they know in part; they see thro' a glass darkly; but then they shall know even as they are known; and see face to face. Then shall they understand infinitely more of the sovereignty, the justice, the wisdom of God in this oeconomy of redemption; and eternally sing the "new song."</P>
<P>IT is also emphatically "good news," if we con∣sider who is the author of it. It is good as to its contents, "peace on earth, and good will towards men." A Saviour born; salvation for the great∣est sinners. "A fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin, and for uncleanness:" Pardon of sin: Peace of
<PB N="26" REF="010503_0025_0F80186940389078"/>
conscience: Joy in the Holy Ghost—Support to believers in death; and everlasting life in the future world.</P>
<P>IT is good as it makes men good. Saul no sooner feels the power of this gospel, than he de∣sists from persecuting, and "preaches the faith which before he destroyed." Zaccheus is at once inclined, by a secret, but powerful influence to re∣store four fold to every one, from whom he might have taken any thing by false accusation. Mag∣dalene will in a moment forsake her atrocious ini∣quities, and follow Jesus. The jaylor instantly washes the stripes he had made, but a few minutes before. In truth, when it comes with power, it makes great saints of great sinners.</P>
<P>ONCE more. It is good. i. e. it is pleasant, as it brings ease to a guilty conscience; consolation to them that are cast down. Which naturally leads us to the</P>
<P>FOURTH general dead: That this good news from heaven, is more welcome to the heavy-laden sinner, and the true believer thirsting after God, than cold waters are to any one athirst.</P>
<P>WHAT good news is, my Brethren, you know: You this moment feel. How long have we anxi∣ously waited the great event, that is now deter∣mined in our favour? How tedious was every day till the interesting news arrived? What gloomi∣ness appeared in every face? How was business stagnated? And how painful were the exercises of our suspended minds? But the scene is altered;
<PB N="27" REF="010503_0026_0F80186A3A212638"/>
and gladness fills our breasts; and would soon shew itself in every look, did not the solemnity of this day and place demand a serious countenance. It gives a spring to action—a pleasure to the man in business; and we hope will speedily revive e∣very branch of trade. "As cold waters to a thirsty soul: So is this good news from a far country"— But infinitely more exhilerating is this good news from heaven;</P>
<P N="1">I. TO the sinner sensible of sin, burdened with it, fearing the wrath of God, and everlasting mis∣ery; ready to give up all hope, lie down and die: For such an one to be told of a way of recovery to the divine favour—in which God can be just, and justify him that believeth; how greatly will it encourage him? But for him to have a be∣lieving view of Christ, as the gospel sets him forth, in the perfection of his divine righteous∣ness—his infinite atonement—the riches—free∣ness and sovereignty of his grace; as saving the chief of sinners—justifying the ungodly; (which is one of the glories of the gospel)—How will he perceive his load of guilt removed;—be brought to trust his immortal all in the hands of this divine Redeemer; and have "joy and peace in believing?" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 15.13.</NOTE> Suppose a criminal at the place of execution, standing on the verge of eternity;; death staring him in the face, to be presented with a reprieve: How will it overjoy and melt him down? But how much more so, to be reprieved from eternal death, from everlasting damnation; and to be made an heir of God, and a joint-heir
<PB N="28" REF="010503_0027_0F80186AB08B3348"/>
with Jesus Christ? Infinitely more transporting is this good news to such a soul!</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is so to the real believer in all his after life. "He thirsts for God, for the living God." And the gospel is the medium in which he sees Him. In it "God is said to be in Christ." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.19.</NOTE> The believer could no more live as a christian, without this gospel; than he could at first believe without it. It is the joy and rejoicing of his heart. It is to his soul, what food is to the body. He feeds upon it; hence he grows in grace. "To know Christ and him crucified," is his invariable resolu∣tion. A crucified Jesus, is to him a theme ever new, and ever welcome. And if at times, he gets at a distance from God, and sinks into a state of lukewarmness; which is alas too frequently the case, nothing but a looking to Jesus as exhibited in this gospel, can restore to him his wonted sense of divine things. "I live, says Paul, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.20.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHAT remains, is an improvement of the subject.</P>
<P N="1">1st. WHAT reason have we to bless God for the gospel? It is an invaluable blessing. "Blessed, says David, are they that hear the joyful sound." You have heard of its influence on the heart and life; and have been reminded this day of the glo∣rious prospect it gives believers beyond the grave. Doubtless every devout mind will be raised; and every mouth filled with the language of gratitude, saying, "We thank thee, O Father, Lord of hea∣ven
<PB N="29" REF="010503_0028_0F80186B73CF2B18"/>
and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.25, 26.</NOTE> Sure such privileges as ours, call for thankfulness. And it might have a ten∣dency to promote it, were we to consider the happy state of the christian world, in contrast with that of the heathen. To do this we need not go far. Behold, my Hearers, with compassion, the Savages on our own continent. They sit in dark∣ness and have no light. How barbarous, and in∣human are many of their customs? They are ig∣norant of the "true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent." While we who are but a few miles from them, are surrounded with the means of grace. This is a favour we enjoy in a sovereign manner. "Whence is it, that thou wilt mani∣fest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?"</P>
<P>THE gospel has a tendency, even when it does not change the heart, to inform the judgment; to soften the conscience; and to lay sinners under some restraints which they cannot easily get over. In this respect it influences the practice even of the unregenerate. We all know that those im∣pressions, that were made on the mind in younger life, by a religious education, are not easily de∣faced. And if such, when they grow up, would cast off all regard to their education, and endulge every vicious desire; they find they cannot do it at once; conscience stands ready to reprove and to condemn. Viewing the gospel then in this light, we have cause to bless God for it. But when
<PB N="30" REF="010503_0029_0F80186C49EDF630"/>
it becomes the power of God, unto salvation, to us, or ours; we shall have matter of endless praise.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. IF the gospel is from heaven, and is so important in its nature, tendency and design;— if we as poor, sinful, apostate creatures, are so immediately interested in it; how may we reason∣ably expect it will be received and entertained? Surely with the highest gratitude, and the warm∣est love. But alas how contrary the treatment it meets with from Infidels and hardened sinners! The Deist pours contempt upon it, and all its votaries. The secure sinner turns his back upon it, saying, "What is your Beloved more than another Beloved?" And many of those who have been favoured with the gospel all their days, re∣main in a state of obduracy and impenitence; and that too where they have sat under the most soul-searching ministry.</P>
<P>FROM hence we see the depravity of human nature: And are persuaded that the success of the gospel now, as well as in the first ages of the Church, depends absolutely upon the powerful operations of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. HERE the heavy-laden sinner beholds re∣lief. It is this gospel only that can heal a wound∣ed conscience. "The letter killeth, but the spi∣rit giveth life." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor. 3.6.</NOTE> All that the law can do, is to shew the sinner his danger; that he is in lost and perishing circumstances; but it neither points to, nor can it administer any relief. It is the gos∣pel of Christ only, that exhibits a righteousness
<PB N="31" REF="010503_0030_0F80186CF847AB48"/>
that answers to the perfection of the divine law. And sinners in this condition see, that the holy, perfect law of God, will dispense with nothing less than perfection. "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 5.18.</NOTE> Here then the gospel is more welcome than cold waters to a thirsty soul, inasmuch as it sets Christ before us, as the "end of the law for righteousness." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.4.</NOTE> This is the balm of Gilead: And Jesus is the divine physician, whose "blood speaketh better things than the blood of Abel," <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.24.</NOTE> to every sin-burdened soul.</P>
<P>I SHALL now dismiss you, with an address suited to the present joyful occasion.</P>
<P>MY Brethren, I have long wished for, and now with pleasure embrace the first opportunity, to congratulate you on a most important event: An event that spread gladness through Britain (a few excepted) and that cannot fail of warming every true American's heart. Should I speak more plainly, your joy might become impetuous; and like the Nile overflow its banks. Look upon it as a royal confirmation of your civil and religious liberties;—these stand in immediate connection with each other: Insomuch that the very act that leaves you in the enjoyment of the one, may be looked upon as confirming to you the other.</P>
<P>THIS whole assembly—yea the whole British America is interested in this great decision. Great You will readily conclude, from what You have seen during the last seven months. I can com∣pare
<PB N="32" REF="010503_0031_0F80186DF28E0828"/>
our present state to nothing with more pro∣priety, than a serene sky, and the smiling sun, after a horrid tempest. Receive it as a favour from the best of earthly Monarchs; and always deeply im∣press your minds, with the belief, that our most gracious Sovereign is the father of his people; and that we, his most faithful subjects in America, have no small share in his royal affections. Your desire is granted—your burden removed;—and you left to enjoy your privileges.</P>
<P>YOU are flushed with joy: It is a joyful oc∣casion. A propriety of conduct under this occur∣rence, I am confident you will all think necessary. And the more danger we are in of imprudence, as we are almost intoxicated with gladness. Bear with me, while I say, That first, and supremely you should offer your unfeigned thanksgivings to the Lord, who reigns in the moral world, in that He hath inclined the King and British Parliament, to deal favourably with us:—That He hath raised up in his kind providence, Friends to the cause of liberty and these colonies. In short, that we have obtained redress—"Let the people praise thee, O Lord; let all the people praise thee!"</P>
<P>LET us entertain the most dutiful and loyal sentiments with respect to the King—rejoice in his upright administration—the increase of his illustrious family, as a further security of our happy constitution: And not fail by words and actions, to discover that the prosperity of his king∣dom is a great part of our happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="010503_0032_0F80186E8598EC20"/>MAY the British Parliament receive that defer∣ence from us that they deserve; and be convinced by our future conduct, that we aim not at IN∣DEPENDENCY; nor wish to destroy distinctions, where distinctions are necessary:—That we re∣joice in being governed according to the principles of that constitution, of which we make our boast as Englishmen: Yea further, that if it was put to our choice, Whether our connections with Great Britain should be dissolved? We, the inhabitants of these Colonies, would rise like a cloud, and deprecate such a disunion.</P>
<P>LET the names of those Worthies who have openly espoused our cause, be had in grateful re∣membrance; not only by the present, but by all succeeding generations.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear to address you in language that seems to imply any want of gratitude and affection to them: And with confidence affirm, in the be∣half of You, my Brethren, and the rest of my Countrymen, that your generous hearts would instantly prompt you, were your abilities suffici∣ent, to erect statues of Gold, to the memory of the Right Hon. WILLIAM PITT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and those other worthy Patriots, who have so eminently in∣terested themselves in the cause of liberty and these Colonies, on a late occasion.</P>
<P>TO conclude. Be it far from us to triumph on this happy event, as tho' we had gained a victory: Or even remotely to hint that our redress is forced. Sensible we are that some of the friends of these Colonies, have gone so far, as to risque their repu∣tation
<PB N="34" REF="010503_0033_0F801870C87AF5A0"/>
on our becoming behaviour for the future. May they not be disappointed! But while we en∣tertain the warmest sense of liberty, may we act in every instance, in such a manner, that our most subtle enemies may have nothing to lay to our charge: Unless they may deem it a fault, to be inviolably attached to his Majesty's most sacred person; and the royal succession in the illustrious house of Hanover.</P>
<P>IN fine. May our expressions of joy on the day ensuing, be kept within the bounds of decency— let us avoid excess, and every unbecoming con∣duct, lest we hurt ourselves, and offend the God of salvation. May the whole issue in unanimity and peace; the firmest connection, and mutual prosperity of Great-Britain and her Colonies.— May we go on to rejoice in the continuance of our privileges, and glorify God in the abundance of his mercy.</P>
