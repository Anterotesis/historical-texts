</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD's own visible People are not exempt from Judgments; yea those among them who are truly godly and dear to God, if by their sinful carriages they cast disho∣nour upon God, and upon Religion; do expose themselves to many humbling and afflictive rebukes from God in this World. Tho' their Sin be pardoned, and shall not condemn them in the other World: yet God sees it necessary for the vindication of His own Name, and the promoting of their good, to give some publick testimony of His displeasure against Sin. Not only such as are of a profane and
<PB N="2" REF="001341_0003_0FB280960E053008"/>
vicious Spirit, whose carriages are an open defiance to Heaven; but many times the Sins of those who are upright and sincere, do help to bring publick rebukes and judgments upon themselves &amp; others. God was so displeased with the Impatience and Diffi∣dence of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> that he excluded them out of Canaan, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.51.52. God was so offended with <HI>David</HI> in the matter of <HI>Ʋriah,</HI> that He brought a great deal of sorrow upon his Family and King∣dom: So provoked with <HI>Solomon</HI> for his Connivance at, and Encouragement of the Idolatry of his Wives, as to rend away ten parts of the Kingdom of <HI>Israel</HI> out of the hand of his Son. And in the Context God denounces an awful threatning against the House of <HI>Eli</HI> for his undue toleration and connivance at the wickedness of his Sons. Such examples should in∣struct us, not to be high minded but fear: Not to think our selves secure because of any visible relation to God; but to carry a holy awe and trembling up∣on our hearts, of his Holiness and Jealousie, who is of purer Eyes than to look upon sin.</P>
<P>In the words we may take notice of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A severe Threatning denounced against the house of <HI>Eli, [I have told him;]</HI> by the message before sent to him <HI>[that I will judge:]</HI> The word signifies either to Condemn, Punish, or Destroy. Here it seems to intend to punish. <HI>[His House]</HI> That is, his Fa∣mily or Posterity, which is often called a mans <HI>House. [For ever]</HI> That is, either till they are utterly wasted and consumed, or rather for a long time, as the phrase <HI>for ever</HI> is oft used. This was in part fulfilled when his two Sons were slain by the Philistines, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4 11. And in part when <HI>Saul</HI> slew <HI>Ahimeleck</HI> and his Fami∣ly, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.18. And finally when the Priest-hood
<PB N="3" REF="001341_0004_0FB28097B46200F0"/>
was translated from the House of <HI>Eli,</HI> and of <HI>Ithamar,</HI> to that of <HI>Eliazar,</HI> by <HI>Solomon</HI> about Eighty years after, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. The reason of this threatning is, <HI>Because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</HI> Their Sin was very horrid and prodigious, as is reported in the preceding Chapter. Their Sins were such as rendred them abominable to God, and contemptible to the People: they brought their Sacred Offices and Gods Holy Ordinances into contempt. Yet their Fa∣ther did not use that Authority which God had given him as an high Priest, as a Judge or chief Magistrate, in punishing them, as by the Law of God he was ob∣liged to do: but contented himself with an easy and gentle reproof.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Aggravation of this Sin, which is especially taken notice of as the immediate, procuring cause of the Judgment: <HI>For the Iniquity which he knoweth.</HI> He could not pretend Ignorance, or want of evidence, that the matter was uncertain: the cry of their wick∣edness was got abroad among all Israel: and God had particularly warn'd him of it by a messenger sent to him, as you read, in <HI>Chap.</HI> 2 27 &amp; <HI>sequ.</HI> But though the matter was so notorious, yet his Parental fondness and indulgence seems to have brib'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judgment that he doth not attend his Duty to God and them, in punishing of them suitably to their hor∣rid Guilt.</P>
<P>That is the clause in the Text that I would parti∣cularly take notice of at this time, and from it you may take this Doctrine.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT.</HI> It is Highly Offensive to God, and shews Men to be very faulty; when they will not Reform what they Know to be amiss.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001341_0005_0FB2809D47355E10"/>This Aggravated <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sin, that he knew his Sons to be vile, and did not do what he might and ought to have done to restrain them. Sometimes a People, and so particular Persons Sin through Ignorance, they are under disadvantages to know the mind of God in particular cases; or else the matter is disputable, its a question to them whether the thing be a Sin: now tho' this dont wholly excuse Sin, yet it lessens it; it is not so heinous nor so aggravated. But when men have so much light held forth, that Sin is par∣ticularly discovered, and God is plainly testifying against it, and they are often confessing it, yet do not set themselves to reform it, but persist in it still; this makes them very guilty before God, and shews their offence to be very great. Hence it is God threatens in a peculiar manner to punish His <HI>Own</HI> People, <HI>Amos</HI> 3▪ 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Fami∣lies of the Earth, therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities.</HI> Why is this? Not because God loves them less than He doth other People; but because His Name and Honour suffers more by their Sins, and they being committed against more light than the Sins of others, are the more inexcusable. <HI>Job.</HI> 15 22. So <HI>James</HI> 4 17. <HI>To him that knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is Sin.</HI> (i. e.) It is so with peculiar aggravations.</P>
<P>I shall first give you the confirmation of the Doctrine, and then make some Application of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Truth of it appears in this, <HI>That it discovers a prevailing</HI> Love <HI>to Sin.</HI> It shows that Sin hath got a great deal of power in their hearts, the more light is resisted in Sinning, the stronger and deeper love men have to it: their pleas and excuses for it, their
<PB N="5" REF="001341_0006_0FB280A1EEACF1B0"/>
willingness to justify it, their readiness to roll it as a sweet morsel under their Tongues; shews their hearts to be much set upon it, that it hath a great interest and activity in their affections, and this corrupts and blinds their judgments. Were there such a hatred and abhorrency of Sin, as ought to be, it would engage to watchfulness against it, and care to resist it, and shun Temptations when offered, and put upon endeavours to mortify it: but mens eager∣ness in serving it under light and conviction, is a sign it hath got a great deal of power in their hearts. This reason the Apostle gives us why <HI>Balaam</HI> was so set to curse <HI>Israel,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5. <HI>He loved the Wages of Ʋnrighteousness.</HI> Now to <HI>Love</HI> Sin is a bad sign: Where it reigns it shews a mans State to be bad. The Psalmist gives it as the Character of a Wicked man, <HI>Psal</HI> 52.3. <HI>Thou</HI> Lovest <HI>evil more than good.</HI> When men prefer <HI>Sin</HI> before <HI>Holiness</HI> in their ordinary habi∣tual course, it shows their State to be bad; shews the heart to be in a bad frame and very much wanting as to the Exercise of Grace, which ought to be maintained. Now <HI>Love</HI> to Sin, very much ag∣gravates Sin. Joh. 3 19. <HI>This is the Condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkness rather than light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It shews want of Love to God; too little sense of and regard to Gods honour</HI> Sin is loathsome and abomina∣ble to God: He looks upon it with displeasure and abhorrency, and it should be so look'd upon by us, and be the object of our hatred and displeasure. And where a spirit of Love to God is kept in Exercise, it will be so: they that love the Lord will hate Evil, so the Psalmist expresses his indignation against Sin, Psal. 101.3. <HI>I hate the works of such as turn aside, it shall
<PB N="6" REF="001341_0007_0FB280A2C87177F0"/>
not cleave to me:</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every false way.</HI> If Persons have a tender respect to Gods Glory, His Name and Honour be dear to them; this will make them afraid of provoking Him, of doing any thing that will lessen and obscure it; and make them watchful against all encroachments of Sin, and be ready to say as <HI>Joseph,</HI> Gen. 39.9. <HI>How can I do this great Wickedness and Sin against God?</HI> When there∣fore persons persevere in the practice of <HI>Known</HI> Evils; though they <HI>See</HI> Sin, are unwilling to <HI>forsake</HI> it: it shews either the want of <HI>Love</HI> to God, or the want of the <HI>Exercise</HI> of it. For if a principle of Love to God were in Exercise, Sin would be a burthen and a grief to the Soul; Holiness would be desired and endeavoured after with all possible means, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.23. Now this will be readily granted, that men are very much to blame either when they hant a spirit of Love to God, or dont maintain it in a lively exercise and activity; for God is worthy of our Love; our best affections are due to Him, both upon account of his infinite and amiable Perfections, and his innumerable and repeated Benefits; and also because this is the great principle of all Evangelical Obedience; nothing is well done in Religion without it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is an argument of much Deadness, Stupidity and Sleepiness of Conscience, that Sin can be let alone, and suf∣fered to lye quietly in the Heart.</HI> A tender Conscience may be sometimes clouded with Ignorance, and thro' mistakes pass a wrong judgment in particular cases, and so suffer the Man to lie for a time in some Sin without Repentance; but otherwise a wakeful and tender Conscience will smite and condemn for Sin; it is Gods Deputy in the Soul, and will take His part, and witness for Him when His Honour is contemned,
<PB N="7" REF="001341_0008_0FB280A50465A410"/>
and His Law violated. When <HI>David</HI> had but cut off the skirt of <HI>Sauls</HI> robe, presently his heart smote him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.5 When <HI>Peter</HI> remembred the words of Christ, he went out and wept bitterly, <HI>Math.</HI> 26 75. A sensible Conscience, will fill the Soul with disqui∣eting accusations, and make it uneasy under the bur∣then of its own guilt, and restless to be delivered from it, and from the burthensome and distressing effects and consequents of it: and therefore will put upon the use of proper means for it. When the Apostle had stir'd up the Consciences of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> to reflect upon their Sinful connivance at the Incestuous Person among them, and their pride and unhumbled Spirit, not mourning for and over him; you see how it wrought in them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11. They could have no rest till they were throughly clear of it, and had by unfeigned Repentance testifyed their displeasure against it. Now it is every ones unquestionable duty, to get and keep a tender Conscience; and their Sin, to give way to Security and Sleepiness of Conscience, for when such a frame of heart prevails, it shews a careless, unwatchful, unthinking heart; the want of a due sense of Gods unspotted Holiness, and Puri∣ty, and the certainty of his Righteous Judgment; the want of care to please God and approve their hearts to Him in a holy Conversation. Yea, if Conscience be suffered to fall asleep, the Soul lies like a Town unguarded, ready to be a prey to an approaching E∣nemy: Satan easily gets an advantage over such, many sad breaches are made in the Peace of their Souls, and many defilements contracted, to their un∣speakable prejudice.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Because it shews a greater Voluntariness and Free∣dom in Sinning.</HI> Such dont Sin through inadvertency,
<PB N="8" REF="001341_0009_0FB280A6ACC5DA60"/>
or from the sudden surprizal of Temptation; but with more deliberation. Now the more freely men commit Sin, and the more of the consent of the Will there is in it, the more vile it is. It discovers a very bad state or frame of heart, that men have lost in a great measure the sense of Gods Authority, and the awe of His Judgment: and therefore such Sins are the more heinous and offensive to God: Joh. 15 22. <HI>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had had no Sin, but now they have no cloak for their Sin.</HI> The coming in of so much Light, made their Sin inexcusable, and took away all pleas and pretences, they had to excuse or cover it before. They cant say they did not know it was Sin, or that it was a thing so offensive to God, or would be of such a dangerous tendency to themselves. The coming in of Light discovers these things to them. Hence Christ tells us, that such Sins expose to greater Judgment: Luk. 12.47. <HI>The Servant that knew his Lords will and prepared not himself to do according to it, shall be beaten with many stripes.</HI> And as hereafter it exposes to a sorer Condemnation, so at present, when-ever the Conscience of a Sinner comes to be awakened, the remembrance of the Light that hath been resisted, the warnings and convictions that have been slighted; makes deep wounds in the Conscience, and procures many heart-piercing fears, and agonies of Spirit. Its great folly for any to ex∣pose themselves to these disquiets of Conscience, by giving way to such Conscience-wasting Sins.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Because it shews, that there is but little Dread upon their hearts of Gods Judgments, either felt or threatned.</HI> Sin exposes men to the just displeasure of a Holy &amp; Righteous God; and He is many times in His Provi∣dences revealing His wrath against the ungodliness
<PB N="9" REF="001341_0010_0FB280AF00D3F9A0"/>
and unrighteousness of men, and expects that these things should be an awe upon their hearts, and be a means to restrain them from adventuring any long∣er in their impenitency: But when his Wrath is not made visible in the <HI>Punishments</HI> of Sin; yet it is al∣ways discovered in his <HI>Threatnings</HI> against it, and hangs like a flaming Sword over the head of a Sin∣ner. These should be an awe to Persons and make them afraid of exposing themselves to Divine Justice: so they have been to some. <HI>David,</HI> said, Psal 119.120. <HI>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> And <HI>Job</HI> saith, <HI>Chap.</HI> 31.23. <HI>Destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his high∣ness I could not endure.</HI> And it should be so with o∣thers: God requires men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 4 4. <HI>Stand in awe and sin not.</HI> And said, Isa. 26.9. <HI>When his Judgments are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of the World will learn righteousness.</HI> Corrections should be instructive, we should learn the evil of Sin by them, and be a∣fraid of continuing in it. If there were any suitable awe of the Justice, or Truth of God upon the heart, any sense of the terribleness of his displeasure, and what a fearful thing it is to be the sorrowful subject of his Threatnings or Judgments, it would be so. Those therefore are very much to blame, whose hearts are glued so fast to their Lusts and Idols; that rather than part with them, will slight their own Mercies, and expose themselves to the Wrath and Jealously of a Sin revenging God. And though Knowing the Judgment of God in his threatnings or providences, will not be check'd or restrain'd by it.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>I pass to the APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001341_0011_0FB280B044EA9B20"/>USE I. <HI>This shews us that a People under the pre∣vailing of an Ʋnreformed Spirit, are many times more Culpable in the sight of God, than they are aware.</HI> Not only the Evils that prevail among them, are in them∣selves, and in their own nature, very offensive to God: but their not improving the light held forth to them, for their Conviction and Reformation; ren∣ders their Sin very culpable, and highly aggravated in the sight of God. It is to be blamed, when a Peo∣ple corrupt themselves, and grow degenerate; but it is worse, when they continue so, and will not be re∣claimed: They are to blame upon a double account.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>With respect to their Ʋnthankfulness for the Light that is held forth to them</HI> Their not improving of it, and submitting to it, shews their low esteem of it; that they dont as they ought, acknowledge the Mercy of God in it. It is a great frown of God upon a Peo∣ple, when he lets them alone in their Sins, without using the means that are proper to convince, reform, and convert them, and bring them back to their duty: When He suffers them to walk in their own ways, as he did the Gentile World, <HI>Acts</HI> 14 6 When He lets them alone, as <HI>Hos.</HI> 4 17. When He leaves them to blindness, and darkness; and will not vouchsafe to use those means with them, that he is wont to do with his People: dont discover their Sin or danger to them▪ nor call them to Repentance: It is a sign God hath mark'd them out for his vengeance and dis∣pleasure. But it is on the other hand a great mercy and blessing when God takes pains with men to bring them to a sight of Sin, and a conviction of their duty; reveals his will to them, shows them how they should govern themselves, and order their conversa∣tions;
<PB N="11" REF="001341_0012_0FB280B1C2D480A8"/>
testifies against their Evils; warns them of the danger of Sin, and encourages them to obedience by promises of Mercy: these are sit means to work upon a heart, and gain men to their duty. God reckons it a great indulgence to Israel, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.19. <HI>He gave his Statutes to Jacob, and his Judgments to Israel,</HI> &amp;c. And justly takes it ill, when it is not duly received: Hos. 8.12. <HI>I have written to them the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</HI> Or a forreign thing, as a thing they had no concern∣ment in; not belonging to them; nor did desire to be governed by. Whatever pretences men make of thankfulness for the word of God, and speak of it as a priviledge, that they have light, and means of Grace; yet if they dont yield Obedience to the light, and conform themselves to the Commands of it; they are <HI>Practically</HI> Unthankful; and do in effect, cast it behind their backs, as <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.26.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In that an Ʋnwillingness to be Reformed argues much of an Incorrigible Spirit.</HI> It shows their hearts are set upon their Evil ways: Hos. 11.7. <HI>My People are bent to backsliding from me:</HI> tho' they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him: it shews the Inveterateness of a disease when it resists, and overcomes healing Medicines. So when suitable means are used to bring a People to Repentance; and all prove frustrate and ineffectual; when nothing will do, it shews much Incorrigibleness and of Irreclaima∣bleness. When they say; either in Words or Practi∣ces, as they, in Jer. 44.16. <HI>As for the Word thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</HI> And 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36 15, 16. When this comes to the height, Judgments come on irremedilesly, and there is no resisting or escaping. Ordinarily, this
<PB N="12" REF="001341_0013_0FB280B366906BD8"/>
spirit doth not come to the height at once, but grows upon a People gradually. Now this is a great degree of it, when they withstand means of Conviction, dont hearken to the voice of Gods Warnings or Judg∣ments; when they Plead for Sin, and are unwilling to Repent, Reform and Turn to God unfeignedly. To be of such a spirit, as to slight Reproofs, and contemn Reprovers, is a very bad Estate. Its bad enough when the hearts of a People are gone off from God, and set upon their Lusts: but it is worse, when they will Not return; but persevere in their evil ways.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>May be to Warn you that you dont resist the Light, that should discover your</HI> Sin, <HI>and bring you to your</HI> Duty. It is a dangerous thing to neglect to Reform what you <HI>Know</HI> to be amiss: there's a great deal of Sin in it, and it exposes those who are guilty of it, to many Judgments. <HI>Eli</HI> had been before now warned of the wickedness of his Sons; but his Sinful Indulgence towards them blinded him: and here God tells him, <HI>He will Judge his house for ever.</HI> So the Pro∣phet declares against <HI>Amaziah,</HI> 2 Chron 25 16 <HI>I know God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.</HI> Not∣withstanding evident testimonies from God, men do sometimes harden their hearts: and by persisting in Sin, expose themselves to <HI>Spiritual, Temporal,</HI> and <HI>Eter∣nal</HI> Judgments. I will mind you of some of the ways whereby Persons do sometimes do it; that you may be cautioned against them.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>By pleading the</HI> Example <HI>of others.</HI> Bad Examples are very pernicious, and a great occasion of harden∣ing men in Sin. <HI>Jereboam</HI>'s Idolatry had a fatal influ∣ence upon all the succeding Kings of Israel. You
<PB N="13" REF="001341_0014_0FB280B762DDC030"/>
find in <HI>Jer.</HI> 44 17. They justifyed themselves in their Idolatrous practices, from the <HI>Example</HI> of their Kings, Princes, and Fathers before them: So it is now, some stand upon their own vindication on such grounds, as to many particular evils: they are not alone in what they do: Many men that they know do so, and such as are wise and good men too. But this is no sufficient vindication. If the thing be in its nature or under such circumstances, evil; the practice of others, will not make it good, how many or who∣soever they be. You know that good men have their failings, and in many things carry corruptly. But besides, all are not good men, that are taken to be so. Many that the World calls <HI>Wise,</HI> Knowing men; are and will be found <HI>Fools</HI> at last: but if they are never so good, or wise; you must follow none any farther than they follow CHRIST, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.1. <HI>Precepts</HI> must be your Rule, not <HI>Examples: Isa.</HI> 8.20. There's hardly any <HI>Duty</HI> but some or other fail in; or any <HI>Sin,</HI> but some have fallen into, and more es∣pecially in a degenerate time; a great laxness, both as to principles, and practices, is wont to prevail among a People. So that if you make this a Rule, you will find very little to be Reformed; yea a great part of your Bibles must be laid by, as useless and un∣necessary.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By entertaining</HI> Prejudices <HI>against those that Warn and Reprove them; as if they did it not in faithfulness to them, but upon some ill design.</HI> This was one reason why they rejected the word God sent by the Prophet, Jer. 43.2. <HI>The Lord hath not sent thee, but Baruch the Son of Neriah setteth thee on:</HI> So Jer. 6▪ 10. — <HI>The word of the Lord is unto them a reproach:</HI> — They interpret faithful reproofs to be reproaches, they say they are
<PB N="14" REF="001341_0015_0FB280B88DFD8718"/>
railed upon. <HI>Ahab</HI> was prejudiced against <HI>Elijah,</HI> and <HI>Micajah,</HI> as if their reproofs were only from want of love to his Person: he counts them his Ene∣mies, and thence takes nothing kindly. Sometimes persons pretend, that others would restrain them from their just Liberties; or they dont know the circum∣stances of their condition; sometimes that they aim at their own particular interest. But these pretences are ordinarily from the deceitfulness of Sin; or the efficacy of Satan, to harden the heart; there's no just reason for them. Our duty, when reproved, is seriously to examine the case, if the Word of God condemns the practice, that's sufficient to deter us from it; for it is by this that God will justify, or condemn us.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By trusting to their</HI> Religious Priviledges, <HI>or seem∣ing Goodness in other cases.</HI> The carnal Jews when re∣proved for their Oppression, Injustice, Idolatry; and called to amend their ways, they boast of their Pri∣viledges, Jer. 7.4. <HI>The Temple of the Lord are these:</HI> as if their visible relation to God, and external observa∣tions would secure them from Judgments. So she makes this a cloak for her wickedness, Prov. 7.14. <HI>I have Peace-offerings with me, this day I have performed my Vows.</HI> Thus carnal Christians rest upon their Ex∣ternal shews of Devotions, because they attend the Worship of God in Publick, Pray in their Families, and the like, that therefore God will excuse their Im∣moralities: They trust in their righteousness and commit iniquity, as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.13. But alas these things do rather aggravate, than at all excuse Sin; and show that men know their duty. God calls for Uni∣versal Obedience; the doing of one duty will not com∣pensate for the neglect of another, <HI>James</HI> 2.11. <HI>Herod</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="001341_0016_0FB280BA0D9FA008"/>
did many things, and heard <HI>John</HI> gladly: but would not part with his <HI>Herodias.</HI> The <HI>Pharisee</HI> could boast, he was no Extortioner, no Adulterer: but he could not say, he was not Proud, and Self-confident. God that calls you to Pray, to Hear, to Meditate upon his Word; calls you also to Live Soberly, and Righteous∣ly, to walk Humbly with God. Partiality in Religi∣on spoils it, and utterly frustrates men of the Rewards of it: <HI>James</HI> 1.26. <HI>If a man seem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, his Religion is vain.</HI> If the heart be upright, <HI>All Duty</HI> will be chosen; and <HI>All Sin</HI> avoided, Psal. 119.6. <HI>Then shall I not be ashamed when I have re∣spect to all thy Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By</HI> Presuming <HI>upon the</HI> Mercy <HI>of God; hoping that shall secure them from the stroaks of</HI> Justice. They Sin freely, and cry, God is Merciful: they dont think God will be so severe, as He threatens, or men would have them believe: <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.19. <HI>When he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart.</HI> This hardens the hearts of abundance: They take up wrong con∣ceptions of Gods Mercy; as if He were of so pitiful, and tender a Nature, that He could not <HI>bear</HI> to see men suffer what He threatens. But you must know, God is <HI>Just,</HI> as well as <HI>Merciful;</HI> and it is no Unmerci∣fulness for God to Punish men according to his threat∣ning. Yea, his Truth and Faithfulness oblige him to it. God hath determined the way and time for the Exercise of his Mercy; and if these be neglected, no Mercy will be shown. The very Devils may as well hope for Mercy, as impenitent Unbelievers, who neg∣lect in the day of Salvation to seek for Mercy in a Gospel way. You cannot take a more direct and rea∣dy way to turn away the Heart of a Merciful God
<PB N="16" REF="001341_0017_0FB280BBABE78080"/>
from you, than by abusing his Goodness to strengthen your selves in Rebellion against Him: This is a most vile Abuse of it, and an Unreasonable inference from it: <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.1. <HI>Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may a∣bound?</HI> God forbid! it is a thought to be abhorred.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>By entertaining</HI> Purposes of future Repentance. Men know their course is Evil, and such as God con∣demns: that this and the other practice which they in∣dulge▪ is sinful; they dare not justify it: but they still their Consciences with this, that they intend to <HI>Repent</HI> of it, and reckon upon no great difficulty in it: tis but repenting, and all shall be well. These purposes of repentance for the future, harden abundance, &amp; make them bold to continue in Sin, against all Counsels, and Reproofs. But alas Repentance is not so easy a work: the heart that is now so much in love with <HI>Sin;</HI> and so full of enmity to <HI>Holiness,</HI> will not easily be changed. A deceitful heart will find other excuses, when the pre∣sent are answered: the old man will struggle hard, before it is subdued. But repentance is a Grace of Gods giving; the heart of stone is too hard, for any created power to break. And as it is what God <HI>gives,</HI> so it is what he gives <HI>freely,</HI> 2 Tim. 2 25. <HI>If God per∣adventure will give them repentance.</HI> Many that presume upon having repentance at leisure, find themselves dis∣appointed; either a sudden Death arrests them, or a hard heart, and a sleepy Conscience seizes upon them. It is a bold adventure to reject Gods gracious Offers, presuming upon <HI>Future</HI> Time, or Grace.</P>
<P>USE III. <HI>Of Examination and Expostulation with you, whether you are not faulty in this matter.</HI> Are there not several things which you know to be Duties, neg∣lected; several things, that you know to be Sins,
<PB N="17" REF="001341_0018_0FB280BD5220CAF8"/>
practiced? We live in a land of <HI>Light,</HI> have great ad∣vantages to know the mind of God, to know how we should adorn the Gospel, and our profession of it. The Grace of God toward us, both as to Light and Peace under Gospel Privileges, is very peculiar and distin∣guishing. And altho' there may be Errors in practice that arise thro' Ignorance, and inadvertency: and some points that are disputable, that persons are not so well satisfyed about. Yet surely, the Evils of this Country are for the most part in such things as are <HI>Known,</HI> yea such as have been often <HI>Acknowledged;</HI> sometimes in a more Publick manner, both by Civil and Ecclesiasti∣cal Rulers: and often in a general way upon such days as this. It is not the want of <HI>Light,</HI> but the want of <HI>Improving,</HI> and <HI>Submitting</HI> to the Light that we have, that retards the Reformation, which hath been so long called for. Let me prosecute this Expostulation in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the great Duty of Improving Seasons &amp; Means of Grace, unto a Repentance from Dead Works, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; to a getting into a Converted and Pardoned Estate, while the Patience and long-suffering of God is continued:</HI> Is not this a thing abundantly Known and Confessed? Certainly Persons that have been bred up under the Calls of the Gospel, and have had the duties of it so frequently inculcated upon them, cant be ignorant of these things. The word is plain and positive concerning them pressing a present Repen∣tance and Conversion to God, Isa. 55 67 <HI>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him whilst he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6 1, 2. <HI>Behold now is the accepted time; now is the day of Salvation,</HI> &amp;c. And Heb 3 5. And how plainly doth it warn of the danger of neg∣lecting
<PB N="18" REF="001341_0019_0FB280C1895DFAD0"/>
it: Heb. 2.3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> There will be no escaping or avoid∣ing the forest condemnation. God shows the riches of his Grace in affording the Seasons of Grace unto men; these are not to be slighted and trifled away; but se∣riously, seasonably, and faithfully improved. It is a great dishonour cast upon Christ, and contempt of the Love of God in the work of Redemption, when Peace and Reconciliation with him, are not regarded; when the fruits of redeeming love in Sanctification, and Ho∣liness, are counted a <HI>Misery,</HI> rather than a <HI>Privilege.</HI> It is a daring presumption, as well as positive Disobe∣dience, when God calls for <HI>present</HI> Repentance &amp; Con∣version, to defer the matter to <HI>future</HI> care. Surely, men know it is their duty to put Honour upon the Lord Je∣sus Christ, to acknowledge him in his Office of a Re∣deemer. Surely it is fit that He, who hath been at the expence of his precious Blood, undergone such abase∣ment, and sufferings; should be glorious in the Eyes of those to whom he is offered; and the fruits of his Redeeming love, be received with all Thankfulness. This is plainly required. <HI>Joh</HI> 5.23. He will have all men honour the Son as they honour the Father: and how is Christ honoured, if he be not believed in, and obeyed? <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.9 Doth not every one con∣fess that there is no other way of Salvation but this which God hath consecrated through faith in his Blood? Yet alas how many are there who neglect these great duties; Live in impenitency, and unbelief, are very little concerned to obtain a real Union with Christ, &amp; Communion in the Benefits of Redemption; make no great matter of letting slip the Seasons of Grace; feel no Misery in their Estrangement from God, captivity to Sin, and Satan; dont groan after
<PB N="19" REF="001341_0020_0FB280C56300A9B0"/>
Redemption; are more intent upon securing the <HI>World,</HI> than obtaining <HI>Heaven;</HI> are more inquisitive what they shall Eat &amp; Drink, and wherewith they shall be Cloathed; than how they may glorify God, adorn the Gospel, secure the happiness of their Souls in Christ, and an unfailing Title to that Glory which he hath purchased?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As to the Means of Worship which God hath appointed, whether Publick, Private, or Secret.</HI> Certainly, the Omis∣sions of them that are among us, are not through Ig∣norance Men know and confess that God is the Supreme and first Being, the fountain of Goodness; &amp; thence the proper object of Worship; that all our Mer∣cies flow from Him; should be ask'd by Prayer, and acknowledged with Praise. As to the <HI>Secret Duties</HI> of Worship, how plain is the Precept, Mat. 6 6 <HI>When thou prayest, Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</HI> &amp;c. Every man hath Personal Wants, Sins, and Temptations; many concerns that are most fit to be transacted in Se∣cret between God and his own Soul; therefore, to O∣mit it, is both an act of Disobedience to God. &amp; a great prejudice to your Selves. Yet, are there not such who are Strangers to this Duty? can seldom find time to con∣verse with God in Secret Duties; can often Sin in Secret; be Wanton, Unjust, Intemperate, in Secret; but dont Pray in Secret: And as to the Publick Worship of God, how plainly hath God enjoyned the several parts of it? And particularly, that very much neglected Ordinance of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> obliging all his Disciples to do it in Remembrance of Him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22 19 That they might keep up a thankful Memorial of the Death of Christ, and the great Ends of it; and restify their dependance upon him for the blessings purchased by it. God hav∣ing received so full satisfaction, and the Covenant of
<PB N="20" REF="001341_0021_0FB280C6C5934AB8"/>
Grace so fully confirmed on us: That Love to Christ, and hatred of Sin might be excited, encreased, and in∣flamed by the lively representation of his painful Suf∣ferings and bitter Death. But tho' these things be so plain, yet how many are there who live from year to year in the neglect of it? Pretending a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pa∣ration for it, and a fear of polluting and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it: but really from a slight and low esteem <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Gods Authority enjoyning it. For if it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from a real tenderness, they would set themselves to understand the nature, end, and use of it; would be wait their ig∣norance, reform their Lives, cry day and night to God for his Sanctifying Grace to purify their hearts, &amp; fit them for Communion with God in it: but alas, how is this neglected? Such Persons will be very inexcusa∣ble in the Day of Christ. You pretend a zeal for Christs Institutions, and commend your Fore-fathers that ventured their blood to rescue your Ordinances from Popish corruptions; and yet when you may attend it in Gospel Purity, turn your backs upon it!</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>As to</HI> Families; <HI>do not men Know that it is their Duty to Educate and Instruct them in Religion, &amp; Vertue; and restrain from Impieties and Immoralities?</HI> This is plain, Prov. 22 6 <HI>Train up a Child in the way he should go;</HI> — Eph. 6.4. <HI>Bring them up in the nurture &amp; admoni∣tion of the Lord:</HI> For this <HI>Abraham</HI> is honoured and commended by God, Gen. 18 19 <HI>I know Abraham that he will command his children and houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do Justice and Judg∣ment.</HI> It is the way for Parents to be instruments to convey the best Blessings to their Children. Not only the tyes of Religion, and Conscience, but of Na∣ture also, oblige to it. To neglect it, would be to be worse than the <HI>Ostriches</HI> of the Wilderness. Are they
<PB N="21" REF="001341_0022_0FB280C84692FBC0"/>
not such as you have solemnly Dedicated to God, and professed a desire that they may be the Lords? Now it will be gross hypocrisy in you, to be negligent of their Education; as well as great Unfaithfulness to God and to their Souls. Have not you been the im∣mediate instruments of propagating <HI>Original Sin</HI> to them? and should not this oblige you, to do the best you can for them, that they may be delivered from the guilt of it? Besides, You have a special interest in them, are always with them, know their Tempers, and Dispositions; have peculiar advantages to be insinua∣ting Principles of Piety, and Vertue; to inure them to the practice of Religion, Civility &amp; Industry. The great concern of upholding Religion, and Propaga∣ting of it to succeding Generations should be a pressing encouragement hereunto. The Work of Christ in our Towns and Churches, will soon languish, if this be neglected: they will be like unpolish'd Stones, unfit to be laid in any building; if a vertuous and pious E∣ducation be neglected. The present, sorrowful State of many of our Children, snatch'd from us and exposed to a Popish and Heathenish Education, should awaken to serious reflections whether among other just reasons for it, God may not be pointing at this neglect. Its certain, <HI>Eli</HI>'s Posterity smarted for his Indulgence, as in the Text. So did <HI>David</HI>'s, tho' he was a very holy man. These therefore, who <HI>Know</HI> all these things, &amp; yet neglect a Godly Education of their Families; who indulge them in ignorance of things fundamental to their Salvation and Conversion: connive at their ir∣religiousness, rudeness, disorders, neglect of Family-Worship, not Sanctifying the Lords Day; or allow irreverent clownish carriages: are greatly to blame. What excuse so ever may be made for such things a∣mong
<PB N="22" REF="001341_0023_0FB280C9DD9DECA8"/>
Heathen; they are certainly inexcusable among those that profess themselves Christians, who <HI>Know</HI> their duty, and have so many incouragements to do it.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Do not men</HI> Know <HI>that an inordinate Affection to the things of this World, is very unbecoming those that Pro∣fess Christianity; and most frequently forbidden in the Word of God?</HI> James 4 4. <HI>Ye adulterers &amp; adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God,</HI> &amp;c. Heb. 13.5. <HI>Let your Conversation be without Coveteous∣ness:</HI> Mat. 6 19, 20, 31, 32. Yea, God hath told you that this is Idolatry, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.5. When that Esteem, Love, Complacency, Desire, which is due to God; is set upon the World: this is as real Idolatry, as mens bowing down to a Stock or a Stone: And when God hath plainly declared wherein this inordinacy of heart discovers it self, in anxious, perplexing, disquieting cares; neglecting a dependance upon God, or satis∣faction with the disposals of his Providence; in greedy, violent desires; when they will be rich, as the Apo∣stle speaks. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.9. We are told, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.22. <HI>He that makes haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.</HI> Men often wrong their Souls, and wound their Consciences, as well as blast their Reputation, when they take any unrighteous ways of gain; defraud, oppress, and over∣reach in their dealings; dont deal truly and honestly; or neglect paying of just debts; or necessary acts of Charity; dare not depend upon Divine Providence, on the encouragement of the Promise; but withold more than is meet: when they begrutch God <HI>His</HI> due; and the Poor, <HI>their</HI> due; count themselves losers in all that they dispose in Works of Mercy and Charity. Or when their worldly cares encroach their time, and thoughts; choak convictions, hinder the Duties of Religion, or occasion Formality, &amp; Slightiness in them;
<PB N="23" REF="001341_0024_0FB280CB48E9CCA0"/>
when the care for the <HI>Body</HI> crouds out care for the <HI>Soul;</HI> and things of the <HI>World</HI> make them neglect <HI>Heaven.</HI> Now doth not such a Spirit too much prevail, not∣withstanding convictions &amp; professions to the contra∣ry? Is it not a thing evident to considering and obser∣ving Persons, that the <HI>Abatement</HI> of Love to Christ, &amp; the <HI>increase</HI> of love to the World, is a main root of the degeneracy that hath grown upon us? How much cause is there to think that Gods impoverishing Pro∣vidences point at this evil, and give us special reason to lament our too great aversion, to Reform it!</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Doth not every one</HI> Know, <HI>that</HI> Intemperance <HI>is an Evil?</HI> The very light of Nature condemns it; Civi∣liz'd Heathen have abhord it, and born witness against it. The word of God doth this more especially, not only witnessing against the grosser acts of it, in noto∣rious <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> and shameful Spewing: but all the tendencies that way; and the occasions of and induce∣ments to it; forbiding men to tarry long at the wine, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.20. Yea, not so much as to look upon it when it gives its colour in the Cup, and moves it self aright, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23 31. (if such a sight proves a temptation) and denounces a Woe against those that are Strong to drink Wine, and men of Strength to mingle Strong drink, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.22. That can pour down cup after cup, without being intoxicated, and bereft of the exercise of Reason. And doth not the Gospel more especially re∣quire men to live Soberly, <HI>Titus</HI> 2.12, 13. To govern their Appetites as to Meat &amp; Drink; &amp; are not some under special engagements, not to frequent Taverns, or give way to an inordinate affection to Strong Drink? If yet any act contrary hereunto, and needlesly spend away their Time and Estates, in indulging a Tipling humour, and gratifying the inordinacy of their Appe∣tites;
<PB N="24" REF="001341_0025_0FB280CCBA759F38"/>
to the wounding of their Consciences; quench∣ing their convictions; dishonouring their Profession; impoverishing of their Families; and refuse to be re∣formed, as is the deplorable case of some, that will certainly be found very culpable before God, and al∣together inexcusable: These things with others of the like nature (that might have been named) are too sad evidences of a great abuse of Light that hath been afforded.</P>
<P>USE. IV. <HI>Of EXHORTATION, Be perswad∣ed then to Reform those things that you</HI> Know <HI>to be amiss, and are plainly discovered to be Sins:</HI> If you neglect this, there will be just cause to fear that Gods displeasure will be continued, and increased. God is as angry with mens Pride and Stubbornness in contempt of his Warnings, as formerly. Its a dangerous thing for a People against whom God hath a controversy, to de∣lay their Repentance, and to continue the causes of his anger. For as it is with particular Persons, so it is with a People; God limits the time of his patience, how long He will wait before the decree shall bring forth, and his wrath break out, till there be no remedy. Our Wisdom therefore is to take up the matter quickly, as in <HI>Numb.</HI> 16.49. To remove what we <HI>Know</HI> is Evil; and to search out what <HI>we know not.</HI> In particular, I would here say.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reform such things as your own</HI> Consciences <HI>tell you are amiss, and do often smite and condemn you for.</HI> Conscience is Gods Monitor in your breasts, and you should listen to it (as you would to a messenger from Heaven) when it warns you of Evil committed, or Duty neglected. Is not Conscience often smiting of you? Sometimes when you hear Sin reproved, and
<PB N="25" REF="001341_0026_0FB280D387D32C80"/>
sometimes when a day of distress and affliction comes; when you think Death and Judgment are near. Are there not many inward disquietments, and perplexing thoughts arising in your hearts? Are there not secret Resolutions to avoid those Evils, or do those duties that Conscience deals with you about? Oh then obey the voice of Conscience in these things, whatever it be that it witnesses to, dont slight or smother it, and with∣stand the checks of it: If you dont carry kindly to∣wards it as a friend; you must expect that it will shortly carry towards you as an enraged Enemy, and will dreadfully upbraid you for the violence done to it: <HI>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI> Prov 18.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Reform what you often</HI> Confess <HI>to be Amiss.</HI> Doubt∣less, besides Publick Prayers, and solemn Confessions, that are made on such Days as this, wherein we are uttering many things against our selves, for the vindi∣cation of the Righteousness of God in the things He hath brought upon us: I say▪ besides these, God hath your particular and personal Confessions, in the daily Prayers that you make. How often are you bewailing the Mispense of Time; abuse of the Seasons &amp; Means of Grace; Unthankfulness for Gospel Mercies; Bar∣renness, and Unprofitableness under Divine Cultivati∣ons; the neglect of government over your Spirits and Passions; inordinate affection to the things of the World; and a too great indifferency and coldness in the things of God and your own Salvation? Now will you not be self-condemned, if notwithstanding these Confessions, these things are still continued! How sad is it, when a mans Prayers serve only for a testimo∣ny of his hypocrisies! And evidence the deceitfulness of his heart in the religious shows that he makes. If there were a hearty Sorrow for such Evils, and a due
<PB N="26" REF="001341_0027_0FB280D62B1DC010"/>
sense of them; it would be manifested in a serious in∣deavour, both to reform, and mortify them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Reform such things as are plainly Witnessed against from the</HI> Word of God. You all confess the Word of God to be the Rule according to which our Lives and Actions should be ordered: that it is to be our Guide, as to matters of Institution, and as to moral duties; Truth, Justice, Temperance, Charity, Modesty, and the like. When ever therefore your Duty laid down in it, is cleared up from it in the Ministry so plainly that your Consciences cant gain-say it; be careful that you dont withstand any such Counsel, or Message from God to you. <HI>David</HI> saith, Psal. 119 161. — <HI>My heart standeth in awe of thy word.</HI> God looks with a gracious respect to those that tremble at his Word, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66 2. When any <HI>Duty</HI> is enforced by it, or <HI>Sin</HI> condem∣ned, we should submit to it with reverence, and thank∣fulness. It is not matter of <HI>Liberty,</HI> whether you will receive, or reject the Commands of God; but what God requires, <HI>Must</HI> be cheerfully submitted to. In∣deed, where matters are disputable or dark to them, there it is mens duty to enquire to labour to have their doubts resolved: but where matters are plain, and un∣questionable; as in duties of <HI>Love</HI> to God, and Men, especially in Moral Precepts &amp; such things as all agree to be duties; and a mans own Conscience cant gain-say it: if in such cases men dont hearken to the voice of God, He will surely require it of them. To inforce this Exhortation, I shall add these following Conside∣rations</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The neglecting to Reform what you</HI> Know <HI>to be Amiss, will argue you to be guilty of great</HI> Hypocrisy <HI>in your so∣lemn transactions with God on such days as these.</HI> Tis a thing confessed, that days of <HI>Humiliation</HI> without <HI>Re∣formation,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="001341_0028_0FB280D799EE2730"/>
are not acceptable to God; but rather days of <HI>Provocation, Isai.</HI> 58.5, 6, 7. There is not that Hu∣miliation, Repentance, brokenness of Heart for Sin, humble waiting upon God for Mercy, as ought to be: but men put off God with empty shows, and external devotions, which rather heighten, than moderate his anger. If there were a serious desire, and engagedness of Heart to be reconciled to God; they would be wil∣ling to remove what lyes as a bar in the way to it; did men count Sin to be so bad, as they profess it to be; certainly they would be willing to let it go. To pre∣tend to desire <HI>Peace,</HI> and Atonement with God, and to neglect the <HI>Terms</HI> upon which He offers it: what is this but to act hypocritically? To cry for favour &amp; pardoning Mercy; and perpetuate the grounds of Gods controversy: what is this but to mock God, to flatter Him with your lips, while your hearts are far from Him? it evidently shows the carnality, and self∣ishness of mens hearts, in such Prayers: Hos 7.14. <HI>They assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Consider what losers you have been, and are still like to be, by not Reforming the Evils God hath witnessed against.</HI> It is confessed, that the <HI>Sins</HI> of Gods professing People, are the <HI>Provoking Causes</HI> of their calamities: Micah 1 5. <HI>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sin of the house of Israel.</HI> Idolatry, Oppression, and neglect of Gods Worship prevaild; and that brought on a∣bundance of Misery. It is the abounding of <HI>Iniquities</HI> among us, that hath made way for the many <HI>Rebukes</HI> of Heaven, that we have been under: and neglecting to be reformed, hath continued them; our own ex∣perience may convince us, what losers we have been hereby: we have forsaken God to our Loss. Is not
<PB N="28" REF="001341_0029_0FB280D966A50930"/>
much of the presence of God lost? His gracious spiri∣tual presence in His <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and His protecting Presence in His <HI>Providences:</HI> what losses in your Out∣ward comforts; in your Liberties, Estates, Families? Men have been violent to serve their Lusts; &amp; have smarted sorely for it. And is it like to be otherwise still? Can we expect that God will change the methods of his Providences, if there be no change for the better in us? Jer. 7.5, 6, 7. <HI>If ye thorowly amend your ways, and your doing; — Then I will cause you to dwell in this place,</HI> &amp;c. God is immutably Just and Holy. If our carriages are changed; then we become meet subjects for His Mercy to be exalted upon. Surely then the bitter fruits of Sin should make every one willing to forsake it: Surely, it is time to grow wiser, to say as <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.7. — <HI>I will go and return to my first Husband, for then was it better with me then now.</HI> Some men think to advance themselves by Sin; to get Estates, &amp; raise their Families, by Injustice, Oppression, and a violent pursuit of the World: but they consult shame to their house. What are men like to get by greediness, in∣temperance, sottish neglects of their Souls, and the great Salvation provided for them thro' Christ; but sorrow here, and eternal ruine at the last?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If you Reform what you</HI> Know <HI>to be Amiss; it will give ground to hope that God will shew you what you know not.</HI> Some are asking, Wherein shall we return? If this question be serious; Surely, such will reform what they do <HI>Know</HI> to be Evil: if otherwise, they act like them in the Prophet, <HI>Exek</HI> 14.3, 4.7. And expose themselves by their mocking of God, to greater Judg∣ments. But God is ready to <HI>Teach</HI> those that are wil∣ling <HI>to Do</HI> their Duty, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7 17. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 15, 16 <HI>Job</HI> Prays with the more confidence, <HI>Chap.</HI> 34 32. That
<PB N="29" REF="001341_0030_0FB280DA421D6990"/>
God would teach him what he knows not; while he resolves, that wherein he hath done iniquity, he will do so no more.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Thus to do, will give hope, that God will have a gracious respect to our Prayers this Day.</HI> For God doth not begrutch <HI>Mercies</HI> to His People, if they are but <HI>Obedient:</HI> Isa. 1.19. <HI>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</HI> We have very great and weighty Requests to present before God this day; That God would bless Our Sovereign, and our Na∣tion; smile upon their Warlike Preparations; still honour them with Success and Victory; give Enlarge∣ment to His Church; and a Revival to the Oppres∣sed, Persecuted Members of it; would preserve our Land from the incursions of Adversaries; would bless, guide and prosper our Military Forces; that He would remember &amp; restore our distressed Captives. Surely, there is no considering Person, but accounts it would be a singular Mercy, if our Prayers for these things, might be accepted at the Throne of Grace. And will you not be prevaild with so far, as to part with your Sins, that you may obtain these Mercies? Oh that you would consider it! Were it not better to part with the dearest Lust, than to be an <HI>Achan</HI> to trouble our <HI>Israel</HI> at such a day as this? How reasonable are Gods demands!
