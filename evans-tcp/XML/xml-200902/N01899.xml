<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is promised as a Felicity to the Church of GOD, <HI>Instead of thy Fathers there shall be thy Children;</HI> And it is received among its Maxims, <HI>The Glory of Children are their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>The People of NEW-ENGLAND, may count it their Felicity, and the <HI>Aboriginal Natives</HI> Christianized in that Country may very particularly do so, That when the Be∣nign Influences of your Incomparable FA∣THER, are withdrawn from us, we have a SON of His to take, like <HI>Him,</HI> a kind cog∣nizance of us. And You as well as we, e∣steem it Your <HI>Glory,</HI> that you are a SON of such a Valuable &amp; Memorable FATHER.</P>
<P>The Honourable Persons, that compose a <HI>Society</HI> of the most Christian Intention, whose CHARTER feels no Feebleness, tho' near the Age at which the Natural Body is usually Enfeebled, have express'd for you the Reverse of what Regards the <HI>Romans</HI> had for the Son of <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> in that

<P>Unto YOU, &amp; unto the Gentlemen of the Society with you, here is of Right now hum∣bly made a small Present, with a short Ac∣count of some Things which you have a Re∣lation to; whereto we add our Hearty Wishes &amp; Prayers, that all the Blessings of Goodness, and the Rewards of all the Good you do for a poor People, may be Multiplied upon you.</P>
<P>But, as it has been, You know well, some∣times the custom of an Eminent Person, to carry about him the Picture of an Excellent FATHER, and often look upon it with Quickened Resolutions, <HI>To approve himself a Son worthy of such a Father,</HI> So, we can Desire <HI>no more,</HI> than what we not only <HI>Ex∣pect,</HI> but also already <HI>Enjoy</HI> in You; That you are the Worthy SON of a FATHER, had <HI>in Everlasting Remembrance,</HI> in these <HI>American</HI> Regions, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the City and Nation whereof he was a Conspicuous Or∣nament: But with none more affectionate∣ly, than, <HI>SIR,</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE was a Direction gi∣ven and taken in the Old Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> Numb. X. 2. <HI>Make thee Two Trumpets of Silver, that thou mayst use them for the calling of the Assembly.</HI> By the <HI>Sound</HI> of
<PB N="2" REF="002246_0005_0FDAD81FD3EA4440"/>such <HI>Silver Trumpets,</HI> the People of GOD' were called unto the Employments and En∣joyments of their Sacred Solemnities.

He may intend the <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the Institutions thereof, His People are <HI>Blessed</HI> withal. And accor∣dingly, It will be no wrong unto the Text, if we put it unto the use, of Supporting this DOCTRINE.</P>
<P><HI>Glorious is the Blessedness of the People, who truly Know the <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which in and with the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD, and the Institutions thereof, arrives unto us.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of it, there is a <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which we are made partakers of. A <HI>True Knowledge</HI> of this <HI>Joy∣ful Sound,</HI> will render the People that have it, a <HI>Blessed People.</HI></P>
<P>Let us proceed more distinctly, in <HI>Three Propositions,</HI> to consider what we have before us.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="002246_0006_0FDAD7E4222CDB08"/>
I. THERE is a <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which is to be heard among the Children of Men, where the <HI>Gospel</HI> is Published, and where the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of it are Established. The <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> which Entertained the Ancient <HI>Israelites,</HI> in and for their Solemn Assemblies, was no less <HI>Typical</HI> than <HI>Musi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al.</HI> In these Days of the New-Testament, we have the <HI>Substance</HI> of the <HI>Instrumental Musick,</HI> which was of old used in the Worship of GOD; the <HI>Shadow</HI> is vanished away. The <HI>Shadow</HI> was of old confined unto the <HI>Temple;</HI> But the <HI>Substance</HI> we have now in every <HI>Syna∣gogue.</HI> The usage of <HI>Instrumental Musick</HI> in our Publick Worship of GOD, hath been long since disrelished among His Faithful People. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> long ago exploded it. Yea, <HI>Aquinas,</HI> himself as late as less than Five hundred Years ago decried it. Indeed, it was one of the <HI>Last Things</HI> which the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> introduced, in the Worship of our SA∣VIOUR, which he had already fill'd with a Multitude of <HI>Superstitions.</HI> We will then for the present look on the Jewish <HI>Trumpets,</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> too, as a part of the <HI>Abrogated Pedagogy.</HI> Yea, but the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> these we have still sounding in our Ears. But the <HI>Sound</HI> has diverse properties assign'd unto it, which it will be proper for us, now to take notice of.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002246_0007_0FDAD820D04ED9B8"/>
There is a <HI>Sound</HI> in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> thereof; And it is, first, A <HI>Great Sound.</HI> Oh! were we so much <HI>in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</HI> as to hear, what is to be heard in the Gospel then brought unto us, we should be able to say, <HI>I heard a Great Voice, as of a Trumpet.</HI> There is a famous Prophecy; Isai. XXVII. 13. <HI>The Great Trum∣pet shall be blown, and they that were ready to perish, shall come and worship the Lord.</HI> What∣ever other Accomplishment this Prophecy may have, it is very gloriously accomplished in the Proclamation which our SAVIOUR in His <HI>Gospel</HI> makes unto us. The <HI>Gospel,</HI> as with the <HI>Sound of a Trumpet,</HI> invites the <HI>Sinners ready to perish, O come, and worship, and obey, and enjoy the Lord.</HI> And when this <HI>Great Trumpet</HI> is <HI>blown, Great, Great</HI> is the <HI>Sound</HI> thereof. The <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpet</HI> is <HI>Great</HI> in the <HI>Extent</HI> of it. We read, Rom. X. 18. <HI>The Sound goes into all the Earth.</HI> In less than Forty Years, it reached unto the utmost Bounds of the vast <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> and tho' Satan Seduced numbers of Miserables into <HI>America,</HI> that they might be out of its hear∣ing, it has now reached hither also. The <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> were at first but a <HI>Couple,</HI> for the Two Sons of <HI>Aaron;</HI> but afterwards in <HI>Solomons</HI> Time, we find an hundred &amp; twenty
<PB N="5" REF="002246_0008_0FDAD7E92AF763C0"/><HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> all Sounding together. Be∣fore the Incarnation of our SAVIOUR, His <HI>Gospel</HI> was heard but a little way. After∣ward, it Sounded far and near, and the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> was <HI>Preached unto every Creature:</HI> It might be said, <HI>It Sounds in every Place.</HI> The <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpet</HI> is also <HI>Great</HI> in the <HI>Effect</HI> of it. A <HI>Loud Sound</HI> indeed; so <HI>Loud,</HI> as to Awaken them that have a <HI>Dead Sleep</HI> upon them! So <HI>Loud,</HI> as to convey <HI>Life</HI> unto them that <HI>Ly Dead in Trespasses and Sins!</HI> Yea, Joh. V. 25. <HI>The Hour now is, when the Dead hear the Voice of the Son of GOD, and Live.</HI> The <HI>Sound</HI> of this <HI>Trumpet</HI> fetches back the Lost Souls of all the Elect, <HI>from the power of Satan unto GOD.</HI> They are not <HI>Silver Trumpets,</HI> that are now <HI>Sounding</HI> unto us; But they are <HI>Saving Trumpets! Faith</HI> comes, the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD comes, the <HI>Love</HI> of our Neighbour comes, and the Foretaste of <HI>Heaven</HI> comes, <HI>by the Hearing</HI> of them. What are they, But the <HI>Power of GOD unto Salvation!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; 'Tis a <HI>Good Sound,</HI> as well as a <HI>Great</HI> one. No <HI>Trumpets</HI> can give so <HI>Good,</HI> so Grateful, so Lovely, a <HI>Sound,</HI> as the <HI>Trum∣pets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> do. <HI>Fame</HI> often in her <HI>Trumpet,</HI> has a <HI>Sound,</HI> which may not be re∣lied upon; But every <HI>Trumpet</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002246_0009_0FDAD824D80805F8"/>gives a <HI>Sound,</HI> of none but <HI>Faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation.</HI> We are told; Prov. XXV. 25. <HI>As cold water to a Thirsty soul, so is Good News from a far Country.</HI> In the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> we have the <HI>Sound</HI> of nothing but <HI>Good News from a far Country.</HI> The <HI>Sound</HI> which we hear in the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> is what was once heard from the Mouth of an <HI>Angel;</HI> Luk. II. 10. <HI>Behold,</HI> I <HI>bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy, that unto you there is born a SAVIOUR.</HI> Wherever the <HI>Gospel</HI> comes, there is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound</HI> of this Te∣nour; <HI>Good News for you who by your Sins have the Face of GOD hidden from you; There is a</HI> JESUS, <HI>who saves His People from their Sins. Good News for you who have the wrath of GOD abiding on you. There is a</HI> JESUS, <HI>who delivers from the wrath to come.</HI> The <HI>Joy∣ful Sound,</HI> which here distinguishes a <HI>Blessed People,</HI> may carry some Allusion to the <HI>Trum∣pets of Jubilee,</HI> heard once in Fifty Years, among the <HI>Israelites.</HI> Once in Fifty Years, there was that custom observed; Lev. XXV. 10. <HI>Then shalt thou cause the Trumpet of the Jubilee to sound, and ye shall proclaim liberty throughout the Land.</HI> Certainly, The <HI>Trum∣pets</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> proclaiming <HI>the Acceptable Year of the Lord,</HI> made a very <HI>Good Sound</HI> un∣to the Poor People that were now to see a
<PB N="7" REF="002246_0010_0FDAD7EAEA5641C0"/>Release from various Miseries: A <HI>Good sound</HI> unto the <HI>Servants,</HI> who were now to call for and to take up their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dentures:</HI> A <HI>Good sound</HI> unto the <HI>Debtors,</HI> whose <HI>Mortgages</HI> were now Expired and whose <HI>Tenements</HI> re∣turn'd unto them. Thus where the <HI>Gospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> arrives, it brings a <HI>Jubilee</HI> with it. It pro∣claims a <HI>Liberty</HI> for the Captives; a <HI>Redemp∣tion</HI> for the Miserable; a <HI>Recovery</HI> of what we have Sinn'd away. 'Tis the <HI>Gospel of Peace;</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> are <HI>Trum∣pets</HI> of <HI>Peace.</HI> The <HI>Sound</HI> of these <HI>Trumpets</HI> is, <HI>A Reconciliation with GOD obtained for Sinners; The Anger of GOD now turn'd away from those, whom He was once Angry withal!</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> which gave the <HI>Law,</HI> had a <HI>Sound</HI> that was trembled at. The Guilty Sinner hearing those <HI>Trumpets,</HI> may have it said of him, <HI>A Dreadful sound is in his Ears.</HI> The <HI>Sound</HI> of those <HI>Trumpets</HI> is, <HI>Cursed is he that continues not in all things to do them.</HI> The <HI>Gospel of our Salvation,</HI> this is a much more pleasant <HI>Sound</HI> than so. The <HI>Sound</HI> of it is, <HI>Grace Grace! The Grace that will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Penitent! The Grace that will Quicken the Impotent! The Grace that will heal them that Languish under all sorts of Maladies!</HI></P>
<P>No wonder then, if thirdly, it be a <HI>Glad
<PB N="8" REF="002246_0011_0FDAD82615C48280"/>sound,</HI> when we find it such a <HI>Good</HI> One. A <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> The Souls that are <HI>Effectually Called</HI> by the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> how <HI>Joyful</HI> does it render them! The <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> do to the Soul, as the <HI>Harps</HI> of <HI>David</HI> unto <HI>Saul;</HI> They drive away the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> of Sorrow, of Sadness, of Despair. The Psal∣mist could say, Psal. CXXII. 1. <HI>I was glad, when they said unto me, Let us go into the House of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> which gave a <HI>Joyful sound</HI> unto the <HI>Blessed People,</HI> had this among other Intentions of them, <HI>They were for the Calling of the Assembly. Glad, Glad</HI> at Heart, was that <HI>Israelite indeed,</HI> when he heard the <HI>Trumpets</HI> give that call; <HI>Come a∣way to the Sacrifices!</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> call us, to those <HI>Appointments</HI> of GOD, wherein we are to Glorify Him with the <HI>Sacrifices of Righteousness;</HI> And how <HI>glad</HI> will a sincere Christian be of such Invitati∣ons! But then, in these <HI>Appointments</HI> of GOD, What is it we meet withal? Enough to make us, <HI>Rejoyce with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory!</HI> The <HI>Tenders</HI> of a SAVIOUR, a Powerful, a Merciful, an only SAVIOUR, are here made unto us. Oh, the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of such <HI>Tenders!</HI> The <HI>Promises</HI> of a most Gracious <HI>Covenant,</HI> are here brought unto us. These <HI>very Great and Precious Promises,</HI> Oh,
<PB N="9" REF="002246_0012_0FDAD7EDCF438820"/>the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of them. The <HI>Sound</HI> of these <HI>Promises</HI> is, <HI>Rejoyce, O thou saved Soul; GOD the Father is thy Friend; GOD the Son is thy Surety for Good; GOD the Spirit is thy Con∣du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omforter; Be of Good cheer, Thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are forgiven thee. The Angels are thy Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dians, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou art a Temple of GOD. GOD will make all things work together for thy good. And were are the Spiritual Blessings of the Hea∣venly Places reserved for thee!</HI> Oh! <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> How Reviving, how Ravishing! When the <HI>Gospel</HI> was Preached with Suc∣cess, we read, Act. VIII. 8. <HI>There was great Joy in the City.</HI> Well might there be so, on such a <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> How <HI>Joyful</HI> is the Souldier, when the <HI>Trumpets</HI> invite him, <HI>To the Spoil! To the Spoil!</HI> The <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> carries this in it: Else it had not been said, <HI>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great Spoil.</HI> The <HI>Blessings</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD leads us to, are Matchless Treasures. What a <HI>Joyful sound</HI> must it be, that leads us to them!</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to <HI>Blessedness,</HI> it is Requisite, not only that we <HI>Have,</HI> but also that we <HI>Know,</HI> the <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> which is brought unto us, in the Gospel, and in the Ordinances of it. Indeed, in a larger sense,
<PB N="10" REF="002246_0013_0FDAD8279B296650"/>To <HI>Have</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> is to <HI>Know</HI> it. A People that <HI>Have</HI> the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> in the <HI>External Enjoyment</HI> of it, these do Enjoy a Rich Favour of GOD. The Places which Enjoy the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and have the <HI>Church state,</HI> with the <HI>Faith &amp; Order of the Gospel,</HI> are therein highly Favoured of the Lord. <HI>Gideons</HI> Fleece, wet with the Dews of Heaven, when the Ground all about is Dry, has a singular <HI>Token for Good</HI> upon it. The <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Trumpets</HI> which proclaim the Kingdom of GOD, is heard in some Happy Lands, while others are left unac∣quainted with it: <HI>Even so, Righteous Father, Because it pleases thee!</HI> And so far they have a Singular Happiness. It may be said unto them, as in Matth. XIII. 16. <HI>Blessed are your Eyes, for they see, and your Ears, for they hear.</HI> Such a People are in some Degree the <HI>Fa∣vourites of Heaven.</HI> They have the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> in some Essay of it among them. Where the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel are <HI>Soun∣ding,</HI> we may say, <HI>The Lord is near.</HI> Yea, the Name of that City, that Country, is, JE∣HOVAH SHAMMAH, <HI>The Lord is there.</HI> A People who so far <HI>Know</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sound,</HI> are after a peculiar manner <HI>Known</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>King of Heaven;</HI> He may say to such; Amos III. 2. <HI>You only have I known.</HI> But,
<PB N="11" REF="002246_0014_0FDAD7F2C4E08900"/>alas, Many who so far <HI>Know the Joyful sound,</HI> may after all come to <HI>ly down in Sorrow.</HI> They that are so far <HI>Lifted up to Heaven,</HI> may be <HI>thrown down to Hell</HI> after all. In such a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> as will render a People a <HI>Blessed People,</HI> there is more im∣plied, than a meer Hearing of it. To <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> as it should be <HI>Known,</HI> is to <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Meaning</HI> of it, the <HI>Value</HI> of it, the <HI>Credit</HI> of it, and the <HI>Power</HI> of it.</P>
<P>First. There are People who <HI>Discern</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> The <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of old, were <HI>Distinct</HI> and <HI>Signal</HI> in the <HI>Sound</HI> there∣of. The Marches, the Motions, the Stands, of the Armies passing thro' the Wilderness, were directed by the <HI>Sound.</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> give <HI>Orders</HI> unto us; we are to take our <HI>Measures</HI> from their <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> People <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> when they <HI>Understand</HI> the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and per∣ceive the <HI>Mind of the Lord.</HI> There are those under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> to whom our Lord says, as He once did unto His Disciples after Sermon; Matt. XIII. 51. <HI>Have ye understood</HI> all these things? And they can reply, <HI>Yea, Lord!</HI> We may say concerning the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> as was of old said concerning the <HI>Pauline</HI> Epistles; <HI>There are in them, some things hard to be understood.</HI> But there are People who
<PB N="12" REF="002246_0015_0FDAD82D80D6C860"/>do competently <HI>Understand</HI> them. They readily perceive the Language of the <HI>Trum∣pets,</HI> about the whole <HI>Mystery of</HI> CHRIST, and the Homage that we owe unto Him; 'Tis not a <HI>Strange Language</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>O <HI>Blessed People,</HI> who so <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> We remember the Speech of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> about the <HI>People which know not the Law,</HI>—How justly to be spoken about the <HI>People,</HI> who <HI>Know not the Gospel!</HI> But then, <HI>Blessed the People, who do know it!</HI> How it thunders, in Isai. XXVII. 11. <HI>It is a People of no Understanding; Therefore He that made them will not have Mercy on them; He that formed them, will shew them no Favour.</HI> But then on the other side; <HI>A People that Understand well the Joyful sound, are a People that GOD has much Mercy for; much Favour for; A Peo∣ple greatly Blessed of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are People who <HI>Esteem</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> They so <HI>Know</HI> it, as to <HI>Prize</HI> it; Set a vast <HI>Price</HI> upon it. In the Bible, Words of <HI>Knowledge</HI> do signify some∣times <HI>Affection</HI> too. Some so <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joy∣ful sound,</HI> as to be <HI>Well-affected</HI> unto it; Yea, to <HI>Prefer</HI> it above their <HI>Chiefest Joy.</HI> There are People, who had rather be with <HI>David,</HI> where they may <HI>hear what GOD the Lord shall say</HI> unto them in the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of the
<PB N="13" REF="002246_0016_0FDAD7F409305350"/>Gospel, than be with <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> at a Bout where <HI>Golden Vessels</HI> are caroused in. They count no <HI>Melody</HI> like that which is to be heard in the <HI>Courts</HI> of the Lord: And look∣ing on the <HI>Silver Trumpets,</HI> they say, as he, Psal. XIX. 10. <HI>More to be desired are they, than much Fine Gold.</HI> They will strive to have the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> with them, whatever Expence of <HI>Silver,</HI> or anything else, it puts them to; They begrutch no cost for it; Are Patient, tho' it cost them the <HI>Bread of Adver∣sity,</HI> and the <HI>Water of Afflicton.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Blessed People,</HI> who so <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> We are told, Psal. CXIX. 165. <HI>Great Peace have they that Love thy Law.</HI> If the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> have our <HI>Love,</HI> they will then speak our <HI>Peace,</HI> cause our <HI>Peace.</HI> The <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Lips,</HI> that blow in those <HI>Trumpets,</HI> is, <HI>Peace, Peace, and all the Blessings of Goodness!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There are People who <HI>Believe</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> We read of, the <HI>Good Seed, fal∣ling into good and Honest Hearts;</HI> Thus there is the <HI>Good Sound coming into Good and Honest Ears.</HI> There are some, that find no <HI>Jarrs</HI> in the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver Trumpets;</HI> They raise no <HI>Disputes</HI> about it; they start no <HI>Ca∣vils</HI> upon it. It was a noble <HI>Confession of Faith;</HI> Act. XXIV. 14. <HI>I worship GOD, Believing
<PB N="14" REF="002246_0017_0FDAD82E51B9EB08"/>all things, which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</HI> Thus, There are People who <HI>Live unto GOD,</HI> and <HI>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD;</HI> And it is because, they <HI>Believe all things that are Sounded in the Trumpets of the Gospel.</HI> About the <HI>Trumpets</HI> that <HI>Sounded</HI> on <HI>Sinai,</HI> it was the perswasion of the Godly People in all after ages; <HI>Lord, Thou spakest with them from Heaven, and gavest them Right Judgments.</HI> Truly, In the <HI>Trumpets</HI> that we have <HI>Sounding</HI> from <HI>Zion,</HI> we have <HI>the Lord speaking from Heaven unto us,</HI> and we have <HI>Right Judgments</HI> in them. This is the per∣swasion of the People that <HI>Know Right Judg∣ments.</HI> They embrace the Gospel, with <HI>Rea∣son satisfied, and Faith established.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Blessed People,</HI> who so know the <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> The <HI>Unbeliever</HI> is always under the Wrath of GOD. The portion of the <HI>Unbe∣liever</HI> is for ever to be deprecated. But our Lord hath assured us, Joh. XX. 29. <HI>Blessed are they that have Believed.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. There are People that <HI>Obey</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> We are informed. 1 Joh. II. 4. <HI>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar.</HI> There are some who so <HI>Know,</HI> as to <HI>Do:</HI> They <HI>know practically,</HI> Their <HI>Knowledge</HI> has their <HI>Practice</HI> conform'd
<PB N="15" REF="002246_0018_0FDAD7F5AA526960"/>unto it. They <HI>Hear</HI> the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the Gos∣pel, and they are not the <HI>self deceivers,</HI> who are no <HI>Doers,</HI> but <HI>Hearers</HI> only. When the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver-Trumpets,</HI> is, <HI>Repair among them who have listed themselves under the Ban∣ner of their SAVIOUR:</HI> Then these People come and put themselves under the Conduct of the Lord, who is <HI>an Ensign for the People.</HI> If the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> be, <HI>Arm, Arm your selves against the Adversaries that seek to devour you:</HI> Then these People <HI>put on the whole Armour of GOD.</HI> If the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> be, <HI>Fall on, Fall on, give no Quarter to the Lusts from which you have your Wounds:</HI> Then these People <HI>Mortify their Members which are upon the Earth.</HI> If the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> be, <HI>Retreat, Retreat out of the the Reach of the Destroyers?</HI> Then these People <HI>Abstain from the Fleshly Lusts which War against their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Blessed People,</HI> who so <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> It is one of the Notes in the <HI>Silver-Trumpets, If ye Know these Things, Happy are ye, if ye Do them.</HI> And one of the <HI>Divine Heralds</HI> that carried the <HI>Siver-Trumpets</HI> thro' the World, has assured us, Jam. l. 2. <HI>The Doer of the Word, this Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be Ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Deed.</HI></P>

III. The <HI>Blessedness</HI> of the People who thus <HI>Know</HI> this <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> is a very <HI>Glorious Blessedness.</HI></P>
<P>A most considerable Article of the <HI>Blessed∣ness</HI> attending a People who hear the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel, and pay due Regards unto them, 'tis this; <HI>They shall walk, O Lord, in the Light of thy Countenance.</HI> A <HI>Gracious Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce</HI> of the Blessed GOD among a Peo∣ple, accompanies the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> The <HI>Sil∣ver Trumpets</HI> are heard no where, but where the King of Heaven keeps His <HI>Court.</HI> There are those whose Office it is, to blow in the <HI>Silver-Trumpets.</HI> Unto those our SAVIOUR hath engaged Himself; Matth. XXVIII. 20. <HI>Lo, I am with you always.</HI> Will <HI>Health,</HI> and <HI>Wealth,</HI> and <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> among a People, make a <HI>Blessed People?</HI> 'Tis commonly thought so: But, What will GOD among a People? Oh! <HI>Blessed that People, whose GOD is the Lord;</HI> and who have a <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> of GOD among them. Even such are the People, who <HI>Know the Joyful sound!</HI> Where the <HI>Gospel</HI> with the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of it, are well settled, main∣tained, respected, and the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> well founded, among a People, it may be said as in Numb. XXIII. 21. <HI>The Lord their God is with them, and the shout of a King is among them.</HI> In one Word, The <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the
<PB N="17" REF="002246_0020_0FDAD7F6E3F598D0"/><HI>Gospel</HI> furnish us with Opportunities for <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with GOD. In them <HI>I will Commune with you,</HI> saith the Lord. We may herein <HI>Draw near</HI> to GOD; GOD will herein <HI>Draw near</HI> to us. The Voice of the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> is, <HI>Draw near to God, and He will Draw near to you!</HI> Can any <HI>Blessedness</HI> be more <HI>Glorious?</HI></P>
<P>BUT more particularly,</P>
<P>First, In the <HI>Joyful sound,</HI> we have the <HI>Guide</HI> to <HI>Blessedness.</HI> The <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> put us into the way, unto the <HI>Rest that re∣mains for the People of God.</HI> We are ignorant of the way to <HI>Blessedness;</HI> and <HI>the way of Peace we have not known.</HI> But where the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> Sound, there is a fulfilment of that Word; Isa. XXX. 21. <HI>Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk in it.</HI> They reveal to us, what we are to <HI>Think,</HI> what we are to <HI>Do,</HI> what we are to <HI>wish</HI> for; <HI>They lead us in the way, wherein we should go.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, In the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> we have the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Blessedness.</HI> The <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> are like the <HI>Golden-Pipes</HI> in <HI>Zech.</HI> IV. 12. Which convey the <HI>Golden Oyl</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> into the Souls of Men. 'Tis by them, that GOD fetches Men out of the <HI>Graves,</HI> in which they lye sinfully and wofully putrifying; and infuses a Principle of <HI>Piety</HI> into them; and inclines
<PB N="18" REF="002246_0021_0FDAD83212C753C8"/>them to the things that are <HI>Holy, and Just, and Good.</HI> That <HI>Effectual Calling,</HI> which brings Men into Blessedness, 'tis in the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel, that the Spirit of GOD gives it unto His Chosen ones; Men <HI>Hear the Word of the Gospel, and Believe.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>BUT let us now make some Improvement of these Instructions.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Blessed</HI> the People, who <HI>Know the Joyful sound;</HI> Then <HI>Wretched</HI> the People, <HI>Forlorn</HI> the People, <HI>Undone</HI> the People, who are <HI>Stran∣gers</HI> to the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> Oh! The pity that is due unto them!</P>
<P>The <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> have now lost their <HI>Sil∣ver Trumpets</HI> for these many Ages. And in their long Dispersion, how pathetical is their Cry unto us. <HI>Have pity on me, O ye my Friends, have pity on me, for the Hand of the Lord hath touched me.</HI> Yea, And how many Protestant Churches, have in our Days, had their <HI>Sil∣ver-Trumpets</HI> forced from them; and instead thereof heard the <HI>Enemies roaring in the midst of the Congregations!</HI> Yea, How many Nati∣ons are there, that never heard the <HI>Joyful sound!</HI> That lye buried in <HI>Paganising</HI> or in <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> infidelity! And is it not a lamentable
<PB N="19" REF="002246_0022_0FDAD7FCAA14EB30"/>thing, that so near unto our selves, there should be so many <HI>Ungospellized Plantations!</HI> Our <HI>Pity</HI> for these, ought certainly to put us upon <HI>Prayer</HI> for them; upon <HI>Study</HI> for them; Oh! What shall be done for them who <HI>lye in Wickedness,</HI> and have this <HI>Epitaph</HI> upon them; <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that be Lost.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Blessed</HI> the People, who <HI>Know the Joyful sound;</HI> Then we are a <HI>Blessed People:</HI> And at the same time we are to be taught how to con∣tinue so. My Brethren, We have the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> at such a rate, that it may almost be said of us, as in Deut. IV. 7. <HI>What Nation is there, who hath God so nigh unto them?</HI> For the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> to be heard sounding as they are in the <HI>American</HI> Regions; <HI>Verily, 'Tis the Lords Doing, and marvellous in our eyes.</HI> May we ever account these, <HI>Our Precious, and our Pleasant Things.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! How <HI>Thankful</HI> ought we to be unto our GOD, for His <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of it! When the <HI>Silver-Trumpets</HI> were of old going to <HI>Sound,</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD were heard making those Acclamations thereupon, <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highest!</HI> And shall not we give <HI>Glory</HI> to the most High GOD, on the Occasion! O Gospellized People, <HI>GOD hath
<PB N="20" REF="002246_0023_0FDAD838D705D068"/>shewed His Statutes and His Judgments unto us, Praise ye the Lord.</HI> When the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of GOD are sounding, shall not our <HI>Trumpets</HI> he sounding too? His <HI>Trumpets</HI> are in His <HI>Ordinan∣ces;</HI> our <HI>Trumpets</HI> are in our <HI>Thanksgivings.</HI> We are so called upon, Psal. XCVIII. 6. <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Trumpets make a Joyful Noise before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Such a <HI>Blessed People</HI> should be a <HI>Thankful People.</HI> But verily, our GOD will not look on us as a <HI>Thankful People,</HI> if we are not also a <HI>Fruitful People.</HI> A <HI>Barren</HI> People, Oh! what a Fearful <HI>Doom</HI> are they threatned with! what a Fearful <HI>Fate</HI> are they warned of? Heb. VI. 7. <HI>It is nigh unto Cursing.</HI> Sirs, Be <HI>Fruitful</HI> in every good Work; <HI>Fruitful,</HI> and always <HI>abounding in the Work of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In the midst of these cares, you will use all due Means, that you may see no Inter∣mission of the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> You will pro∣vide seasonably, for the Succession that shall be needful, by all due Cares about the Means of <HI>Education</HI> in our Land, without which the Land becomes a <HI>Scythian</HI> Desart. But when you make this Provision, Oh! Look up to the Glorious Lord, that you may be <HI>Blessed</HI> with truly <HI>Silver-Trumpets:</HI> Never have any but a <HI>Man of Worth;</HI> Such as will be of <HI>Good Metal;</HI> and such as in the Cause of GOD will always <HI>Lift up their Voice like a Trumpet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002246_0024_0FDAD7FDA044D570"/>
BUT this is that which is most of all to be urged upon you. Hearken, Hearken, to the <HI>Joyful sound.</HI> Hearken to it, and Comply with it. The <HI>Joyful sound</HI> is that, <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and Return to the Lord, who will have Mercy on him.</HI> Hearken to it, and with Echo's of Devotion Reply, <HI>My GOD, I Return unto thee!</HI> The <HI>Joyful sound</HI> is that; <HI>Come to me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Rest.</HI> Hearken to it, and with <HI>Echo</HI>'s of Devotion Reply, <HI>My SA∣VIOUR, I come unto thee!</HI> That <HI>Grace of GOD which bringeth Salvation,</HI> has the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> in it. Now, your <HI>Echo</HI>'s to the <HI>Trumpets</HI> must be those; <HI>Lord, I Desire, I Resolve, to lead a Godly, a Sa∣ber, a Righteous Life before thee!</HI></P>
<P>My Friends, The <HI>Last Trumpet</HI> that is to sound at the Appearance of the Glorious Lord, who is to <HI>Judge</HI> the World, will er'e long Summon you, to give an Account of your <HI>Compliance</HI> with the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of GOD. You that now hear the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of these <HI>Trumpets,</HI> must er'e long hear the <HI>Awful sound</HI> of that amazing <HI>Trumpet.</HI> A Loud, and a Shrill <HI>Trumpet</HI> will Sound, <HI>Arise, ye Dead, and come to Judgment!</HI> Oh! May our <HI>Compliance</HI> with the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> now be such, that we may <HI>find
<PB N="22" REF="002246_0025_0FDAD83A5012AB78"/>Mercy in that Day.</HI> So comply with it now, that the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> of a, <HI>Come ye Blessed,</HI> may be heard by you, in the Day, when <HI>the Times of Refreshing shall come from the Presence of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>¶ WHAT has been hitherto spoken, is but an INTRODUCTION, unto the Expressions which we are this Day to make, of our concern to have the JOYFUL SOUND of the <HI>Glorious Gospel</HI> convey'd unto the <HI>Aboriginal Natives</HI> of the <HI>Good Land,</HI> which the GOD, <HI>whose is the Earth and the Fulness thereof,</HI> has bestow'd up∣on us; Our Concern, that the Promise made unto our SAVIOUR, <HI>I will give the Hea∣then for thine Inheritance, and the Uttermost Parts of the Earth for thy Possession,</HI> may have a very Illustrious and Conspicuous Accom∣plishment, in the Arrival of our INDIANS unto the Knowledge &amp; Service of our Great REDEEMER.</P>
<P>It is utterly Unknown unto us, <HI>How</HI> and <HI>When</HI> it was, that AMERICA came to be first <HI>Peopled</HI> with the Inhabitants of that Olive <HI>Complexion,</HI> which, they say, the <HI>Biggest Part of Mankind</HI> is Coloured with. Be sure, They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho have Entertained us, with <HI>Disser∣tations</HI> upon that <HI>Obscure Subject,</HI> have been
<PB N="23" REF="002246_0026_0FDAD7FF52A78728"/>sufficiently Luxuriant in their <HI>Fancies;</HI> and have sometimes allow'd a little Resemblance in <HI>Sound,</HI> (as, for instance, <HI>Massagetae,</HI> and <HI>Mas∣sachusetts,</HI>) to be a Sufficient Bottom for their most Confident Conjectures.</P>
<P>Let a foolish <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and <HI>Peyrerius</HI> pre∣tend what they will, we are sure, that the <HI>Americans</HI> are of the <HI>Noetic Original.</HI> And there is a great probability of what is affirm∣ed by <HI>Acosta</HI> and <HI>Brierwood,</HI> That <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America</HI> are Contiguous. The <HI>Phoenicians</HI> also were great Sailors, and by <HI>them</HI> (tho' <HI>Bochart</HI> in his Nice tracing of them allows it not,) either Intentionally or Accidentally, People might be carried over the <HI>Atlantic</HI> into <HI>America.</HI> 'Tis reported, That <HI>Christopher Colonus,</HI> (the Leader of all our <HI>American Co∣lonies,</HI> in the two last Centuries,) had some Advice of People, by a violent Storm carried over into <HI>America,</HI> to lead him into his No∣ble Undertaking. A Learned Helvetian, (the Incomparable <HI>Heidegger,</HI>) has well observed, That the Countries which have <HI>Great and Wide Seas</HI> between them, yet generally meet some where with an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or some small passable Distance of Water between them; which Conjunction of Countries, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sine Numine facta est.</HI> But I must refer you, to the Lucubrations of them who have written,
<PB N="24" REF="002246_0027_0FDAD83BEF5416C0"/>as diverse others besides <HI>Hornius,</HI> have done, <HI>De Origine Gentium Americanarum,</HI> and espe∣cially an Essay in the Introduction to the <HI>Iti∣nerantium Bibliotheca,</HI> more lately Published, for the Satisfaction of that Enquiry, <HI>Which way the Indians, and other wild Creatures might come into America?</HI></P>
<P>We are as much at a loss about the <HI>Time,</HI> as we are about the <HI>Way.</HI> For, though we have <HI>Evidences</HI> as well as <HI>Traditions</HI> (con∣firming the ever-Triumphing Sentiments of our Excellent <HI>Woodward</HI>) that the <HI>Flood</HI> reach∣ed unto <HI>America,</HI> yet we have none, (except the Reliques of <HI>Giants,</HI> like those at <HI>Albany</HI> should pass for such) that <HI>America</HI> was Peo∣pled before the Flood.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Opinion</HI> of a Learned <HI>Englishman,</HI> who would fain make <HI>America</HI> to be the Seat of them that shall <HI>Think an evil Thought,</HI> in a Thing that is yet above a Thousand Years off; That when the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel, were going to Sound in the <HI>other Hemisphere,</HI> upon the Ascension of our SAVIOUR, the Devil then seduced Numbers into these Re∣mote Regions, in hopes that the <HI>Joyful sound</HI> thereof, never would reach hither after them. The <HI>Deceiver of the Nations</HI> has been <HI>Deceived,</HI> if this were his Expectation; and that he may be more so, is that for which we now are La∣bouring.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002246_0028_0FDAD800C899F338"/>
Yea, The Sovereign Grace of Heaven in <HI>that</HI> for which we are now Labouring, is yet more to be Adored, if the <HI>Opinion</HI> of a Lear∣ned <HI>German</HI> should be any better than <HI>so;</HI> which is, That <HI>America</HI> was not Peopled un∣til after the Preaching of the Gospel in the <HI>other Hemisphere,</HI> when GOD for their Con∣tempt of it, Ordered their coming hither as into a <HI>Banishment,</HI> where they that would not be <HI>Saints,</HI> do now almost cease to be <HI>Men:</HI> A Sentence of <HI>Transportation into America,</HI> was by Heaven passed upon them. We may leave it unto a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bius</HI> to Dispute it with them.</P>
<P>However, We are not so much at a Loss, <HI>How</HI> and <HI>When</HI> the Gospel was first Preached unto the <HI>Americans.</HI> We cannot be of the Perswasion, that it was done by the <HI>Mouth,</HI> or near the <HI>Age</HI> of the Apostles; or that <HI>All the World</HI> Evangelized by them, was much without the Bounds of the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> Tho' <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> tells us, <HI>That [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,] there was no kind of Men tho' never so Barbarous, among whom GOD the Father was not in the Name of a Crucified JE∣SUS then called upon:</HI> Tho' <HI>Irenaeus</HI> tells us, <HI>That</HI> [sicut Sol, Creatura Del in Universo Mundo] <HI>the Gospel had like the Sun, shone upon all Nations.</HI> Tho' <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells us,
<PB N="26" REF="002246_0029_0FDAD83D53683360"/><HI>That</HI> [Loca abditarum multarum Gentium, <HI>and,</HI> Adspice universas Nationes, <HI>and,</HI> In Pro∣vincijs omnibus quas Sol oriens at{que} Occidens Lustrat,] <HI>the most hidden Nations, all of them, even all that the Rising or Setting Sun shone upon, had the Name of CHRIST then adored among them.</HI> Tho' <HI>Jerom</HI> tells us, <HI>That</HI> [Pel∣litorum turba Populorum, <HI>and,</HI> Scythiae fri∣gora fervent calore Fidel,] <HI>The Scythians and People that were clad with nothing but Skins, were then warmed with the Light of the Gospel:</HI> And, tho' <HI>Chrysostom</HI> tells us, <HI>That</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] <HI>in what∣ever Land the Sun looks upon, and even with∣out the Bounds of their World, a Worship was there paid unto our Crucified SAVIOUR.</HI> And <HI>Theodoret</HI> adds, <HI>That the Preachers of the Gos∣pel had carried it [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] unto all the Men in the World.</HI> These Flourishes, are to be understood with their proper <HI>Limitations.</HI> Nor can we think, That because <HI>Nicephorus</HI> tells us, of <HI>Matthew's</HI> carrying the Gospel unto the <HI>Man-eaters,</HI> he must therefore be a Preacher to the <HI>Americans.</HI> Nor shall we believe the Legends we have had about ei∣ther the Apostle <HI>Thomas,</HI> or a <HI>Lord-Thomas,</HI> Eight hundred Years after him, until we can see <HI>Malabar</HI> &amp; <HI>Brosile</HI> holding a nearer Com∣munication with one another. But consider∣ing
<PB N="27" REF="002246_0030_0FDAD80517722AB0"/>how imperfect and spurious a <HI>Gospel</HI> it is, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have given to their <HI>Indians,</HI> and how the boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conversion of the Pagans (whereof sometimes one poor Friar, if we may believe <HI>Martinus de Valen∣tia,</HI> and others of the Fraternity, has Bapti∣zed some Hundreds of Thousands) among them, has been little other than a <HI>Change of Idolaties:</HI> We may truly say, The <HI>First Plan∣ters</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, are the <HI>First Preach∣ers</HI> of the PureGospel to the <HI>Americans,</HI> that we certainly know of. This <HI>Good Work,</HI> O NEW-ENGLAND, thou hast the Honour of making the <HI>First,</HI> Right, Fair and Genuine <HI>Beginning</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>What we have now to do, is to Prosecute this <HI>Good Work: A Good Work!</HI> whereto our Obligations are not vacated by the Judgment entred against that former <HI>Charter</HI> of the Colo∣ny, which declared, <HI>The winning and inciting of the Natives of the Country unto the Know∣ledge and Obedience of the only True GOD, and SAVIOUR of Mankind, and the Christian Faith, to be a principal End of the Plantation.</HI> A <HI>Good Work,</HI> whereto our Invitations are still as Forcible, as they were, when the <HI>Seal</HI> of the Colony was, a Poor <HI>Indian</HI> having a Label from his Lips, expressing this Cry,</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="002246_0031_0FDAD84330A77990"/>
Upon this <HI>Good Work,</HI> there are Two or Three REMARKS, with which I am now Briefly to Entertain you.</P>
<P>In the First Place, It is a matter of <HI>Humble Gratitude</HI> unto GOD our SAVIOUR, that so much of <HI>His Work</HI> in this matter, has <HI>appeared</HI> unto His weak <HI>Servants,</HI> and of <HI>His Glory</HI> in it, <HI>unto their Children.</HI> The desolate <HI>Indians,</HI> that survived the Mortal Contagion, which had newly and strangely swept away such Multitudes, as to make some Room for the <HI>European</HI> VINE that was Transplanting hi∣ther, were the most forlorn <HI>Ruins of Man∣kind,</HI> and very doleful Objects. Their way of living was lamentably Barbarous. Be∣yond all Expression Dark were their Noti∣ons of a God; and <HI>Chepian,</HI> or the <HI>Evil God,</HI> had as great a share as <HI>Kautantowit,</HI> or the <HI>Good God,</HI> in their Adorations, The <HI>Mani∣cheans</HI> (as great a Tribe of <HI>Hereticks</HI> as ever were in the World) may boast of <HI>these,</HI> as being really <HI>Theirs.</HI> Tho' they saw a People Arrive among them, who were Clothed in <HI>Habits</HI> of much more Comfort &amp; Splendour, than what there was to be seen in the <HI>Rough Skins</HI> with which they hardly covered them∣selves; and who had <HI>Houses full of Good Things,</HI> vastly out-shining their squalid and dark <HI>Wigwams;</HI> And they saw this People
<PB N="29" REF="002246_0032_0FDAD80B6300B568"/>Replenishing their <HI>Fields,</HI> with <HI>Trees</HI> and with <HI>Grains,</HI> and useful <HI>Animals,</HI> which until now they had been wholly Strangers to; yet they did not seem touch'd in the least, with any <HI>Ambition</HI> to come at such Desireable Circum∣stances, or with any <HI>Curiosity</HI> to enquire after the <HI>Religion</HI> that was attended with them. To <HI>Humanize</HI> these Miserable <HI>Animals,</HI> and in any measure to <HI>Cicurate</HI> them &amp; <HI>Civilize</HI> them, were a work of no little Difficulty; and a Performance little short of what One of our most famous <HI>Physicians</HI> esteemed the <HI>Greatest Cure</HI> that ever himself had wrought in all his Practice; <HI>To bring an Idiot unto the use of Reason.</HI> But then, to Raise these Mi∣serables up, unto an Acquaintance with, and an Experience of, the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and bring them not only to <HI>Know</HI> something of their SAVIOUR, but also to <HI>Live unto GOD</HI> by Him; A <HI>Noble Work</HI> This; But every One must say, No very <HI>Easy</HI> One!</P>
<P>Two Decads of Years, from the Beginning of this Colony, had not rolled away, before an Entrance was made upon this Work of PIETY; And our celebrated ELIOT, having with a <HI>Labour that overcometh all things,</HI> made himself the Master of a Language, wherein many of the Words are of <HI>Sesquipe∣dalian,</HI> and <HI>Unaccountable</HI> Dimensions (One
<PB N="30" REF="002246_0033_0FDAD8460197CE70"/>of the words, I know, that has more than Fifty Letters in it,) he Visited the Villages of these <HI>Indians,</HI> and with a very discrete Management Preached the <HI>Word of Truth, and the Gospel of their Salvation,</HI> in their own Language unto them. This Memorable Ser∣vant of GOD, was no sooner at work, but in some other Parts of the Country, the <HI>Harvest</HI> had some other Labourers appearing in it, who <HI>did vertuously;</HI> but no One is <HI>wronged,</HI> if it be confessed, that our ELIOT shone as <HI>the Moon among the Lesser Stars,</HI> and <HI>Excelled them all.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Good Man</HI> had the <HI>Hand of the Lord</HI> with him; &amp; his Evangelical Attempts were so blessed of GOD, that anon (beyond what any <HI>Xavier</HI> could pretend unto!) <HI>Churches</HI> were formed among these <HI>Indians,</HI> and in an <HI>Holy Covenant</HI> they <HI>gave themselves unto the LORD, and then unto one another,</HI> Engaging to Live in the Service of GOD, and carry on together the Worship of our SAVIOUR, ac∣cording to the Directions of the Gospel. This was done, after <HI>Synods</HI> of <HI>English Chur∣ches</HI> had seen <HI>Strict Examinations</HI> passed upon their Improvements in <HI>Experimental Piety,</HI> as well as their <HI>Knowledge in the Mystery of CHRIST.</HI> And an Eminent Person present at these <HI>Examinations,</HI> did then Publish to
<PB N="31" REF="002246_0034_0FDAC94A6461C050"/>the World this Testimony concerning it. His words were these; <Q>There is so much of <HI>GOD's Work,</HI> as that I cannot but count it a <HI>Great Evil,</HI> Yea, a Great Injury to GOD and His Goodness, for any to make light of it. To see and hear <HI>Indians,</HI> opening their Mouths, and lifting up their Hands &amp; Eyes in <HI>Prayer</HI> to the Living GOD, calling on Him by His Name JEHOVAH, in the Me∣diation of JESUS CHRIST, and this for a good while together; to see and hear them <HI>Exhorting</HI> one another from the Word of GOD; to see and hear them <HI>Confessing</HI> the Name of CHRIST JESUS, and their own Sinfulness! Sure, this is more than usual! — We that were present that day, saw and heard them perform the Duties menti∣oned, with such Grave and Sober Counte∣nances, with such Comely Reverence, in their Gesture, and whole Carriage, and with such Plenty of <HI>Tears,</HI> as did argue to us, that they spake with the Holy Fear of GOD, and it much affected our Hearts.</Q></P>
<P>BUT then, the Early Care of SCHOOLS, having brought these Uncultivated <HI>Salvages</HI> unto the skill of <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Writing,</HI> this in∣defatigable <HI>Doer of the Work of</HI> an EVANGELIST, with an immense [ANAGR.] <HI>Toile,</HI> produced a <HI>Library of
<PB N="32" REF="002246_0035_0FDAD8478CBB1050"/>Christian Piety</HI> for them. First, he Translated the whole BIBLE into their Language; (And a Translation of the PSALMS into Metre, whereof the <HI>Indians</HI> are <HI>Notable Sing∣ers,</HI> accompanied it:) which has been Twice Printed here; and is the only BIBLE that ever was Printed on the Western side of the <HI>Atlantick.</HI> A work for, <HI>Thy Land, O IM∣MANUEL!</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Great Light</HI> had several <HI>Satellits</HI> wai∣ting on it; <HI>Primers,</HI> and <HI>Grammars,</HI> and <HI>Ca∣techisms,</HI> and <HI>The Practice of Piety,</HI> and, our BAXTERS <HI>Call to the Unconverted,</HI> and some other Composures. Unto which <HI>Indian-Li∣brary,</HI> there have been since added, <HI>The Con∣fession of Faith;</HI> and, <HI>An Epistle giving the In∣dians an Account of what the English desire them to Know and to Do, in order to their Happiness:</HI> And, <HI>A Discourse concerning the Institution and the Observation of the LORDS-DAY;</HI> And, <HI>Family-Religion Excited and Assisted;</HI> And, <HI>A Monitor for Communicants.</HI> Doubtless there have been some Souls to be <HI>brought unto Life,</HI> where the <HI>Living Waters from the Sanctuary</HI> were to run in such Streams as these.</P>
<P>It was an odd Ceremony and Superstition in some ancient <HI>Baptisms,</HI> that when they <HI>Renounced Satan,</HI> they turned their Faces to the <HI>West,</HI> where the Sun sets in <HI>Darkness;</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="002246_0036_0FDAD80E0D787898"/>But Professing their Faith in our SAVIOUR, they turned their Faces to the <HI>East,</HI> the <HI>Re∣gion</HI> where <HI>Light</HI> arises. We now have seen the <HI>Sun Rising in the West;</HI> A Forlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n People in the <HI>Western</HI> World now said, <HI>Thro' the Tender-Mercy of our GOD, the Day-Spring from on high has Visited us.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, tho' ELIOT, and those that follow'd him, in the <HI>First Essays,</HI> to bring the <HI>Light</HI> unto the Nations, that were doomed unto <HI>Outward Darkness,</HI> be Dead, yet there has been a Succession of worthy Englishmen, who have <HI>gone on</HI> with the Essays; And there are <HI>Indians</HI> also, who are constant Preachers of the Gospel unto their Country∣men; so that the <HI>Good Work</HI> having <HI>Obtained Help from GOD,</HI> and having triumphed over the Plots of Ill-affected Men to divert from it the <HI>European</HI> Waters that nourish it, it <HI>conti∣nues to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Work is <HI>Glorious:</HI> But a Principal <HI>Glory</HI> of it, has been the <HI>Purity</HI> of the CHRISTIANITY, which has been brought unto these <HI>Indians,</HI> in our Attempts to <HI>Christianize</HI> them. The RELIGION wherein they have been instructed, has not been the <HI>Religion of a Party;</HI> but the <HI>Pure Religion and Undefiled,</HI> which is evidently con∣tained in the <HI>Sacred Scriptures.</HI> The <HI>Main
<PB N="34" REF="002246_0037_0FDAD848ABC9BF50"/>Things,</HI> which the Instructions given to them have insisted on, have not been, either the Things which <HI>Good Men</HI> may be and have been <HI>Divided</HI> in, or the <HI>Observations</HI> wherein the <HI>Wickedest</HI> Men may act their Part as fairly as the <HI>Holiest,</HI> and with which the <HI>Kingdom of GOD cometh not.</HI> But the Pure MAXIMS of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel</HI> are those that have been instilled into them; Even those which All <HI>Good Men</HI> are <HI>United</HI> in, and which GOD will keep the <HI>Nations in Distress and Great Perplexity,</HI> until He has compelled His Chur∣ches to <HI>Unite</HI> upon. What they have been taught, has been, To <HI>Worship GOD in the Spi∣rit,</HI> and <HI>Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> and <HI>Love one another,</HI> and shun every thing which the <HI>Light of GOD</HI> in their Souls may con∣demn as an <HI>Evil Thing.</HI> If the Direction gi∣ven them has been, To Study their own <HI>Con∣dition</HI> and acquaint themselves with the <HI>Ora∣cles</HI> of GOD, and make their <HI>own Prayers</HI> with the Assistances of His Holy SPIRIT; ra∣ther than to cramp their Devotions with a <HI>Liturgy:</HI> To be content with such <HI>Officers,</HI> and Managemen's of the Offices, in their Socie∣ties, as they find in the <HI>Word of CHRIST</HI> an unquestionable Institution for: To <HI>Sabba∣tize</HI> on the LORDS-DAY, and know no other <HI>Stated Holidays</HI> of Religion; but yet keep
<PB N="35" REF="002246_0038_0FDAD80F887F4B00"/>whole <HI>Days</HI> of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> on the Occasions for them; 'Tis to be hoped, That such as have a true Sense of <HI>Genuine</HI> and <HI>Primitive Christianity,</HI> will not think the worse of them; nor any but the Mean Sons of <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, think that any more should be Judged <HI>Necessary</HI> for them. 'Tis indeed <HI>Marvellous</HI> to see [And yet, <HI>My Bre∣thren, Marvel not!</HI>] the Spite, with which this <HI>New-English Work,</HI> has been treated in the Writings of some who differ from us, in some <HI>Disputed Ways</HI> of Worship. I chuse ra∣ther to <HI>Pitty</HI> them than to <HI>Mention</HI> them; and only Wish that the Allatrations may quicken the pace of our <HI>Piety.</HI></P>
<P>We rejoyce in what our <HI>Dutch</HI> Brethren have done in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where the <HI>School∣masters</HI> have taught some Hundreds of Thou∣sands, to recite, The <HI>Lords-Prayer,</HI> the <HI>Greed,</HI> the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> a <HI>Morning-Prayer,</HI> an <HI>Evening-Prayer,</HI> a <HI>Blessing</HI> before Eating, and after. But in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> we have aimed at a <HI>Vital Work,</HI> before we have <HI>Baptized</HI> them.</P>
<P>There were no less than <HI>Thirty Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> which occupied the Land, that is now covered by the <HI>New-English</HI> Colonies. A Great Part of these Contemptuously and Obstinately Rejected the Repeated Offers of the Gospel, which our <HI>Evangelists</HI> made unto
<PB N="36" REF="002246_0039_0FDAD84A10BB3FB8"/>them; which Impiety was very much owing unto their TORY-<HI>Sachims,</HI> who were Jealous that <HI>Christianity</HI> would bring some Abridg∣ment upon their <HI>Arbitrary Government.</HI> The Devil, to whose Possession and Slavery these Miserables thus Resigned themselves, quickly inspired them to a Precipitation into foolish <HI>Wars</HI> with the English Colonies, which quick∣ly terminated in the utter Extirpation of them from off the face of the Earth. After they had for a little while distressed us, they fell into Confusions, into which as Men under an amazing Syderation, or like <HI>Beasts</HI> that are Stung with an <HI>Hornet,</HI> they every where fell an easy Prey to the <HI>Sword of the Wilder∣ness;</HI> They <HI>Perished Wonderfully;</HI> and some of their Stoute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Captains, laying their Hands on their Breasts, were heard giving this Ac∣count of it, <HI>Here the Englishmans GOD makes us afraid!</HI> In these <HI>Wars,</HI> the <HI>Christianized Indians</HI> assisted the <HI>English,</HI> and were very Ser∣viceable in subduing the <HI>Pagan Rebels.</HI> And now I know not any Numbers of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Province, but what have Embraced the <HI>Doctrine of GOD our SAVIOUR;</HI> [Oh! were it more Adorned among them!] Except those <HI>Destroyers</HI> of the <HI>East,</HI> whom the <HI>French Priests</HI> have infatuated with the Poisons of their <HI>Popery;</HI> But for the Reclaiming of
<PB N="37" REF="002246_0040_0FDAD813B01AC608"/>whom, we are now using our late Endea∣vours; and <HI>this Day</HI> looking up to Heaven for a Blessing upon them. In the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> there is a small Nation of <HI>In∣dians</HI> yet remaining in a <HI>Paganism</HI> sunk down almost as low as <HI>Atheism:</HI> Which have <HI>refu∣sed Instruction, and cast behind them the Words</HI> of GOD, that some worthy Men have here∣tofore made them a Tender of: But a <HI>Mis∣sion</HI> has been from us lately made unto them, not without some encouragement; and the Government and Ministry there, are lauda∣bly exerting themselves, to introduce a bet∣ter State of Things among them. The Rest of our <HI>Indians</HI> are generally become such as we must call our <HI>Christian Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, I must proceed, in the second place, humbly to <HI>Confess</HI> and <HI>Bewail,</HI> the <HI>Clouds</HI> which we see this <HI>Good Work</HI> encum∣bred withal, and bespeak the Tears of a <HI>Bochim</HI> from us.</P>
<P>It is true, The last Account which we took not very long ago, informed us, That at <HI>Marthas-Vineyard,</HI> and the little Adjacent-Island, there were <HI>Ten little Congregations,</HI> wherein our Great SAVIOUR is Worshipped; and which have <HI>Two English-men,</HI> and <HI>Ten Indians,</HI> that in their own Language do Preach
<PB N="38" REF="002246_0041_0FDAD855829A6D78"/>unto them. At <HI>Nantucket,</HI> there were <HI>Three Cengregations,</HI> and as many Preachers. On the Continent, there were between Twenty and Thirty Congregations of <HI>Christianized Indians,</HI> whereto there belong some Thou∣sands of Souls. These had then Ten <HI>English Preachers,</HI> who gave them their Instructions and Assistances; and between Twenty and Thirty <HI>Indian Teachers,</HI> by whom the Exer∣cises of the <HI>Lords Days</HI> are mostly managed. Some of these Congregations, are not yet advanced unto all the Privileges of the <HI>E∣vangelical Church-State.</HI> But a considerable Number are so; and some <HI>New Churches</HI> were lately formed among them. I suppose, Things are not very much altered, from what they were in this Account, which the last <HI>Visitation</HI> brought unto us. Very many English Witnesses have been much affected with the Devotion, that they have seen ex∣pressed by these <HI>Indians</HI> in their Publick Ex∣ercises of Religion; their <HI>Prayers</HI> formed with much of pertinency, and uttered with as much solemnity; their <HI>Sermons,</HI> of Or∣thodox Divinity, at the Hearing whereof, Children scarce a dozen Years old, readily turn to the Proofs; their <HI>Psalmody,</HI> in which they out-do some of our <HI>English Assemblies;</HI> and the <HI>Admonitions &amp; Excommunications,</HI> with
<PB N="39" REF="002246_0042_0FDAD8160F34E9F0"/>which they Censure Scandalous Offenders. One that is at this time a Worthy English Minister, but a Preacher to the <HI>Indians</HI> in their own Language also, has given in unto us, this Testimony. <Q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Wor∣ship; with the Affectionate Confessions of such as are admitted into the Church; make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the <HI>Spirit</HI> wrought in them, <HI>according to the working of the Mighty Power of GOD.</HI> Their Method, respecting those that are admitted into their Com∣munion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practised in most parts. The Person to be Admitted, stands forth in the midst of the Assembly; and first makes a <HI>Declaration</HI> of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and sometimes desires <HI>Information</HI> in things most arduous and doubtful. And then he makes a <HI>Con∣fession of Sin;</HI> which they do, (as I have seen,) with <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> like him in the <HI>Sixteenth</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> And then he gives an Account of <HI>Experiences</HI> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Counsel and Exhortation to remain stedfast in the
<PB N="40" REF="002246_0043_0FDAD85AA948C578"/><HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Ways</HI> of the Lord, being given them by their <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Elder,</HI>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not ungrounded∣ly) hope, That <HI>Additions are made unto the Church daily of such as shall be saved.</HI> There are many, which maintain a Christian Con∣versation, and are to be accounted, not <HI>Al∣most,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Christians.</HI> And this does encourage the Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> to them; when we see, it pleases GOD to make it, <HI>His Power unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But notwithstanding all of this, we must humbly say, <HI>'Tis a Day of Small things.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are not yet improved so far into <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Civility, and Industry, and Husbandry, as were to be desired, and as a due Improve∣ment in <HI>Christianity</HI> would oblige them to. Many of the <HI>English,</HI> instead of giving them Assistences and Encouragements, have rather contrived <HI>Indirect Ways</HI> to keep them under, and Entangle them in <HI>Debts</HI> unto them; and Vile Things have been done upon their <HI>In∣solvencies, Religion,</HI> 'tis to be fear'd, is under a Decay among them: Their <HI>Good Order</HI> lan∣guishing: And the older and wiser <HI>Indians</HI> going off, and English Neighbours too often hurting of the Survivors, much of that little <HI>Glory</HI> in which has been among them, seems to have an <HI>Ichabod</HI> written upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="002246_0044_0FDAD816249182E0"/>
But what has of all things the most Threat∣ning Aspect upon them, is, The love of <HI>Strong Drink,</HI> which strangely Captivates the <HI>Indians;</HI> insomuch that <HI>very few</HI> are found A∣ble wholly to resist and conquer the Tempta∣tion, when 'tis laid before them; and which, notwithstanding the Prohibitions of the <HI>Law,</HI> finds ways of coming at them, that seem al∣most Incurable; and which, where it has its operation, does confound all Religion, and every Valuable Interest. <HI>Rhum;</HI> That <HI>Branch</HI> of the <HI>River of Death;</HI> Alas, it threa∣tens, more than any thing else, that we can think upon, to drown the <HI>Good Work,</HI> for which we are this day Signalizing our Solli∣citude. <HI>Men of Israel, Help!</HI> What, what shall be done for the Help, of a Mischief, so formidable, so deplorable!</P>
<P>THIS is what I am in the Third Place arriv'd unto. I was going to Entreat your <HI>Thoughts,</HI> your <HI>Cares,</HI> your <HI>Pains,</HI> that the <HI>Good Work</HI> may not be lost, but be <HI>Revived in the midst of the Years,</HI> wherein we see so many Discouragements upon it. <HI>But as touching this Brotherly Love, ye need not that I speak unto you!</HI></P>
<P>I am not insensible, that there are clamours now and then made as if your Small <HI>Revenue,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="002246_0045_0FDAD85D89E971F0"/>were not always applied unto the best <HI>Advan∣tage;</HI> and as if your whole Affair were under a <HI>Defective Management.</HI> Yea, if the Glori∣ous GOD had not almost <HI>Miraculously</HI> ap∣peared more than once to defeat the Plots of some designing Men, who Envied the Small Revenue which <HI>Our work</HI> has been kept alive withal, it had before now been diverted unto other purposes. But some of those who are most clamorous, are Men whose <HI>ways are al∣ways grievous;</HI> and the <HI>Better Men</HI> who some∣times receive Impressions from them, it may be, do not enough consider, how common it is, for things to appear easy in <HI>Speculation,</HI> that are found for to be encumbred with In∣numerable and Insuperable Difficulties in the <HI>Execution.</HI> I am well assured, That in the Discharge of the <HI>Trust</HI> reposed in you, a <HI>Cha∣rity</HI> to the Pitiable case of the Subjects before you is ever working in you; a <HI>Conscience</HI> of Duty to GOD continually acts you; and you have a Religious concern to acquit your selves as they that must give an <HI>Account</HI> of their <HI>Stewardship,</HI> when you are to appear be∣fore the glorious Judge of the World: There will be found in you, all that belongs to a <HI>compassionate Samaritan. Be not wearied nor faint in your Minds;</HI> but go on to <HI>Do the Best you can,</HI> for the Supporting and the Promoting
<PB N="43" REF="002246_0046_0FDAD817128AFE78"/>of a <HI>Good Work,</HI> which the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> will do all they can, to Encumber with ob∣structions, that will require an uncommon <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> to Encounter them. The <HI>Ocean</HI> over which our Predecessors passed hither, was by Antiquity revered as leading to <HI>Holy and Blessed Seats,</HI> and something of a <HI>more than Humane</HI> Character. Let us <HI>Do the Best we can,</HI> that it may be so; and if we can∣not raise our <HI>Indians</HI> up unto all the <HI>More than common</HI> Goodness that we are Striving for, yet let us come to it <HI>Our selves,</HI> particu∣larly in our Doing our Best for <HI>Them,</HI> that they may do so. And whereas a Main In∣tention which you now have in your View, is, To bring the Rising Generation of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> unto a more general Understanding of the <HI>English Language,</HI> and more into the <HI>Eng∣lish way of Living,</HI> You will employ your fre∣quent and earnest <HI>Consultations</HI> upon it, and Call in the Advice of as many others, as may offer any <HI>Proper Methods,</HI> for the more Effectual Prosecution of it.</P>
<P>But as a Testimony of your <HI>Zeal</HI> for this <HI>Good Work,</HI> and of the Sense which you have, that without the Influences of GOD our SA∣VIOUR we <HI>can do Nothing</HI> to purpose, You are this Day pouring out your <HI>Prayers</HI> before Him. These <HI>Prayers</HI> are doubtless a <HI>Token
<PB N="44" REF="002246_0047_0FDAD8642230E248"/>for Good,</HI> that there may be some <HI>Reserves of Mercy,</HI> for a Remnant of the most Pitiable Ones, on whose behalf we are now concerned. If but a <HI>Few</HI> of them, should be brought into a Sincere <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and of their <HI>Neigh∣bour,</HI> and a Living <HI>Faith</HI> on our only SAVI∣OUR, it will be richly worth all the Time and Cost that has been laid out upon them all. And the Acknowledgments which we now make of our Entire Dependence on the <HI>GOD of all Grace</HI> for all the Good that is to be done among them and unto them, are the most likely way for our coming to see that <HI>Sweet</HI> Thing, Our <HI>Desire accomplished.</HI></P>
<P>While our Supplications to <HI>OUR Father</HI> are thus Engaged, we shall Remember our dear Brethren, of the <HI>Danish</HI> Mission as far off as <HI>Malabar;</HI> the <HI>Good News</HI> of whose amiable Enterprizes have been as <HI>cool waters to our Thirsty Souls.</HI></P>
<P>I will recite a passage in One of their Let∣ters, because we may make an Application of it unto our own Affair. <Q>Whenever the <HI>Sun</HI> riseth in these Eastern Parts of the World, it is always Surrounded with <HI>Thick Glouds;</HI> the common People of the <HI>Malabarians</HI> tell us, that these <HI>Clouds</HI> are huge overgrown <HI>Giants,</HI> thro' which the <HI>Sun</HI> every Morning must fight his way, before ever it can appear
<PB N="45" REF="002246_0048_0FDAD81FCB180EB0"/>in its Compleat Lustre, and Brightness. This is a Fancy of the Vulgar Sort of our <HI>Mala∣barians;</HI> But the Application we might make of it, will hold too True in every Respect, The <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> would fain begin to Rise, in these benighted parts of the World: But what Opposition, what Contradiction, does this <HI>Sun</HI> meet with; even from those who should help to re∣move the <HI>Clouds</HI> and obstacles, which hi∣therto have intercepted His <HI>Light</HI> and Ap∣pearance, and this too, whilst this <HI>Light</HI> but just begins to break forth, and to appear in its first Dawn and Morning Red? How∣ever, 'tis to be hoped, that the <HI>Light</HI> will triumph at last over the <HI>Powers of Darkness,</HI> and spread its Rays over all the Regions of Heathenism and Superstition.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Excellent Things</HI> are done by those Rare Men, in <HI>Laying a Foundation of True Christia∣nity</HI> among the <HI>Orientals,</HI> for the next Gene∣ration to build upon, and Propagate a <HI>Religion</HI> which is not a meer <HI>External Thing</HI> that may render the Proselytes to it no better than <HI>Tinkling Cymbals,</HI> but that which sets up the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> in the SOUL, and abolishes the <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> and introduces the <HI>Image</HI> of our SAVIOUR, there. This inexpressibly
<PB N="46" REF="002246_0049_0FDAD865D7FBEC50"/>Endears those our Brethren unto us, and com∣mends them to our <HI>Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>With so saying, I will add, That I would, if I had Opportunity, bespeak the <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Faithful abroad in the World, for <HI>our own Affair,</HI> in such Terms, as are used for <HI>Theirs,</HI> by the College of Great Men, whom the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has lately Incorporated, for the <HI>Propagation of the Gospel in the</HI> East-Indies; and who on the occasion thereof are also doing some New Things to <HI>Christianize</HI> their own <HI>Finlanders.</HI> The words used by these Great Men, in the Instrument lately Published by them, are such, as I would if I could address very many People with. Say they, <Q><HI>Private Persens,</HI> who make Consci∣ence of daily addressing their Heavenly Fa∣ther in Secret, are Entreated to Remember this work, as a proper Subject in their con∣stant <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Supplications.</HI> The more fervent they are in their Addresses to GOD, the greater we trust will be the Blessings of Almighty GOD upon the whole Under∣taking.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, I despair of any very Great Mat∣ters to be done, for the Spreading of the Gos∣pel, thro' the World, until the <HI>Israelitish Na∣tion</HI> be Returned unto their Land, and Con∣verted unto their GOD. The <HI>Camp</HI> in the

<P>And, Oh! if our <HI>Prayers</HI> may have any share, in obtaining a <HI>Zeal of the Lord of Hosts</HI> to be Enkindled in more of His People, for the Propagating of a <HI>Religion</HI> which Glori∣fies Him, and Recovers Mankind unto Felici∣ty! <HI>Then</HI> should we see, another face on the corners of <HI>England,</HI> the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the boggy Recesses of <HI>Ireland,</HI> than there is yet appearing. <HI>Then</HI> should we see the <HI>Africans</HI> no longer so treated like meer <HI>Beasts of Burden,</HI> as they are in the Plantations of cruel <HI>Americans:</HI> And the Great Revenues left unto the Charitable Design of <HI>Christiani∣zing</HI> the <HI>Negro's,</HI> would have some Good Ac∣count given of them. <HI>Then</HI> should we see the Noble <HI>Essays to Save a Lost World,</HI> carried as far as the Hunger of <HI>Trade,</HI> now makes Men run thro' <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> even to the <HI>In∣dies.</HI> And <HI>Madagascar</HI> it self, where some think they see <HI>Fields ripe for the Harvest,</HI> would not be left unvisited.

<P>Yea, who can tell, but the Holy SPIRIT promised upon the <HI>Asking</HI> for it, would make such a Descent, as to <HI>do Wondrously,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Arm of the Lord</HI> would be <HI>made bare in the Eyes of all the Nations,</HI> and <HI>all the Ends of the Earth, should see the Salvation of our GOD;</HI> and the <HI>Dove</HI> would so Return to us as to Tarry with us, and the <HI>Flood</HI> of Igno∣rance and Wickedness, wherein the Earth is now over-whelmed, shall be carried away.</P>

<HEAD>The RELIGION, <HI>Which ALL Good Men are united in.</HI></HEAD>
<P>(1) THere are Glorious Maxims of PIETY, whereto our Great SAVIOUR will have the Hearts and Lives of His People conformed, that He may <HI>Receive them to the Glory of GOD.</HI> There are the <HI>Things which accompany Sal∣vation;</HI> The Things which must be found in all that shall be <HI>Saved;</HI> and are no where found but in those that shall be <HI>Sa∣ved;</HI> The Tempers and Actions of that <HI>Vital Piety</HI> wherein Men <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>There are certain Methods of PIETY directed by our SAVIOUR, that so a Just GOD, offended by our Sins, may be <HI>Reconciled</HI> unto us, and that so we may be <HI>Qualified</HI> for the Enjoyment of GOD in that <HI>Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002246_0058_0FDAD8CAB5B2A0B8"/>
There are certain Points of the <HI>Ever∣lasting Gospel,</HI> according to which, it must be <HI>with a loud Voice</HI> proclaimed unto us, That we must so <HI>Fear GOD, and give Glory unto Him;</HI> and Except the <HI>Kingdom of GOD,</HI> be therewithal first set up in us, we cannot be Received into His <HI>Heavenly Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>(2) There are Especially THREE Grand MAXIMS of PIETY, which we must yield our <HI>Assent</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> unto.</P>
<P>The first is this.</P>
<P><HI>The ONE most High GOD, who is the FATHER, and the SON, and the Holy SPIRIT, must be my GOD; and I must make it the Main Intention of my Life, to please Him with all Holy Obedience and Sub∣mission unto Him; and be afraid of Every Thing which His Light in my Soul shall con∣demn as an Evil Thing.</HI></P>
<P>The second is this.</P>
<P><HI>A Glorious CHRIST, who is the Eternal Son of GOD, Incarnate and Enthroned in our Blessed JESUS, is the Redeemer of Mankind;
<PB N="54" REF="002246_0060_0FDAD8CBCE7C30E0"/>
unto whose Great Sacrifice I must repair for Acceptance with GOD; And under His Conduct, I am to Expect a Compleat Happiness for my Immortal Soul, to which He will Re∣store my Body, when He shall come to Judge the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Third is this;</P>
<P><HI>Out of Respect unto GOD and His CHRIST, I must heartily Love my Neigh∣bour, and for ever do unto other Men, as I must own it Reasonable for them to do unto me.</HI></P>
<P>(3) 'Tis a Soul Moulded according to these <HI>Maxims</HI> of PIETY that may, and none but such a Soul truly can, <HI>Rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But then, this Vital PIETY, must be accompanied, with an Acknowledgment of those <HI>Truths,</HI> without the <HI>Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="55" REF="002246_0062_0FDAD8D0D3492DF8"/>whereof PIETY cannot be kept Alive, nor can Men <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> We must therefore Acknowledge the <HI>Sacred Scrip∣tures,</HI> for the <HI>Rule</HI> of what we are to <HI>Believe</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> in Religion.</P>
<P>Briefly, There is a Degree of PIETY, which must be found in all that are not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nated from the Life of GOD.</HI> Except the <HI>GOD</HI> who is <HI>Above</HI> all, be <HI>Lov'd above all;</HI> Except our SAVIOUR be adored as the <HI>GOD of our Salvation;</HI> Except we lay aside all <HI>Malice</HI> towards our <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and avoid every Course, which our <HI>Conscience</HI> Condemns as a <HI>way of Wickedness,</HI> we cannot <HI>See Life,</HI> but have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding on us.</HI> All those <HI>Principles,</HI> which are <HI>Essential</HI> to the Exercise of this PIETY, are <HI>Fun∣damentals of Religion.</HI> All <HI>Good Men</HI> do come unto them: And all they are <HI>Good Men,</HI> who Live according to them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III. Unto Fidelium.</HI> Communications between the <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Eastern</HI> INDIA.</HEAD>
<P>¶ UNto many of the Faithful, the Mat∣ters now to be related, will be <HI>Good News from a far Country.</HI> It will be a plea∣sure unto them who are <HI>Waiting for the King∣dom of GOD,</HI> when they see some opening of it in the <HI>Eastern</HI> as well as the <HI>Western</HI> IN∣DIES. It will be an Addition unto the pleasure, to see the <HI>Harmony</HI> which True, Right, Genuine PIETY will produce, in Persons that are in many <HI>Sentiments</HI> as well as <HI>Regions,</HI> distant from one another. And if that Article of our Creed, <HI>The Communion of Saints,</HI> be illustrated in this Correspondence, Of <HI>this</HI> also we will say, <HI>How Good and how pleasant is it?</HI></P>
<P>In the Latter End of the Year, 1714. the Illustrious Dr. <HI>Franckius,</HI> did me the Honour of writing to me, from <HI>Hall</HI> in the Lower <HI>Saxony,</HI> a very large Letter, which has been since Translated and Published (by that <HI>Man of an Excellent Spirit,</HI> Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehm</HI>) in <HI>London.</HI> And from that Letter, I will now transcribe one Historical passage, which will Introduce those that are now going to be divulged.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="002246_0064_0FDAD8D1D2CD0CA0"/>
<Q><P>I can't but Entertain you on this occasion with another Charitable work, but of a very Singular Nature, and Extending it self as far as the Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> In the Year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>705. Two Young Can∣didates of Divinity, <HI>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh,</HI> and <HI>Henry Plutscho,</HI> Natives of <HI>Germany,</HI> were sent by <HI>Frederick</HI> IV. the present King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> to attempt the Conversion of the <HI>Malabar</HI>-Heathens there. They arrived safely at <HI>Tranquebar,</HI> in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 1706. and immedi∣ately applied themselves to Learn the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> and <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongues. The Latter of these Languages, tho' exceeding Hard and Intricate, was, within Eight Months time, so far Mastered by Mr. <HI>Ziegenbalgh,</HI> that he began to Preach to the <HI>Malabar</HI> Heathen in it, and by this Means, to Explain unto them the <HI>Method of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>In Effect, GOD left not their Endeavours without a Blessing: For soon after, some of these Heathens being wrought upon by the Word of Salvation, did shake off their Pa∣gan Idolatry, and readily came over to Christianity. And this hopeful Beginning proved a New Encouragement unto these
<PB N="58" REF="002246_0065_0FDAD8824C9E0AA0"/>Labourers, to go on with the work so happi∣ly set on foot, tho' not without Toil and Difficulty. However, after a Little while, they found so many <HI>Lets</HI> and <HI>Impediments</HI> in their way, raised by Heathens &amp; Christi∣ans, as seemed to break the very first Efforts tending to the Conversion of the Heathen, to the Church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>The Pagans were generally possessed with an utter Aversion to the Christian Religion; and this for no other Reason, but because they saw so much Impiety and Profaneness abounding among those that Call them∣selves by This Name. This was attended with many Consequences. For no sooner did an Heathen Embrace the Christian Faith, but he was for ever banished from all his former Goods and Possessions, and left to the wide World, to shift for him∣self. However, there were some other Im∣pediments thrown in their way, far more Obstructive to the Propagation of the Gos∣pel, than all what the Heathens could do to Oppose it. Those Impediments were started on the part of the <HI>Christians</HI> them∣selves, whose Duty it had been to aid and support so laudable an Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="002246_0066_0FDAD8D3629A6600"/>
But in the midst of these Various obsta∣cles, raised Originally by the Common E∣nemy of Souls, GOD was pleased to Excite many persons in <HI>Germany,</HI> to favour the Labours of the Missionaries; Especially after they were Convinced, with what Can∣dour and Diligence they endeavoured to manage the work Committed unto their Trust. And truly, Considerable Sums of Money were required, for Settling and improving, the several Branches of this Constitution. It was necessary, that a Church should be built, and Charity-Schools should be set up, and all manner of <HI>Mala∣barian</HI> and Christian Books transcribed, for the Improvement of the whole Design.</P>
<P>About the Latter End of the Year, 1708, when the work increased under their hands, Three Persons more, were sent over on the same Errand. — They were supplied with a Printing-Press, a Font of Latin Types, and other Necessaries, at the Expence of the English Nation; the whole being accompa∣nied with a present of Fifty Pounds in Money, for carrying on the better the De∣sign in hand. — And we in <HI>Germany</HI> did what we could, to prepare a Font of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bar</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="002246_0067_0FDAD883CB8829E8"/>Types, in order to Print off, such Books as were thought necessary for the Church and Schools gathered on the Coast of <HI>Coro∣mandel.</HI> — A Printer come from <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>psick</HI> freely offered himself to go over to the <HI>East-Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> to manage the Printing part for the use of the Mission. We readily Em∣braced this offer, and looked upon it, as a Finger of Providence, thereby to settle this work on a Good and Promising Foundation; since this Person was not only acquainted with the Art of Printing, but had also a sufficient skill in Graving and Casting of the necessary Letters. — Having put them∣selves on board the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, they pursued their Voyage to <HI>India;</HI> where they happily landed the <HI>June</HI> Ensuing.</P></Q>
<P>The Methods &amp; the Effects of the Mission, whereof this Great Man has given this brief Account, have been wonderful.</P>
<P>It pleased the Excellent <HI>Ziegenbalgh</HI> to address his Letters unto a Mean <HI>American:</HI> who happened (I scarce know, how) to be known unto him, under an Undeserved Character; Expressing his Desires of an Epistolary Correspondence; and that he
<PB N="61" REF="002246_0068_0FDAD8DEDB79C488"/>might have our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntiments upon the ways of advancing the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>In answer to his Desires, there went from <HI>New England,</HI> the following Letter to him.</P>

<HEAD>TO the REVEREND, and every where known and honour'd Minister of the Gospel, Mr. <HI>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh,</HI> Pastor of the Indian Church, And an Indefatigable Missionary, and most faithful and famous Servant of CHRIST, among the <HI>Malabarians</HI> in the <HI>East Indies;</HI> Much Happiness in the Lord.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Evangelical</HI> and indeed <HI>Angelical</HI> work, in which (<HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> You and your Collegues) We with a Joyful &amp; Grate∣ful Mind, see you Engaged with such a toyl∣some Labour; 'Tis truly, the most Noble of all that are or ever can be undertaken among the Children of Men. Than this most <HI>Holy Work,</HI> there can be Invented, Nothing more Heavenly, Nothing more Gracious, Nothing more Agreeable &amp; Subservient unto the First and Main End, and Chief Good, of Men; There can be nothing more Profitable to Man∣kind; or more worthy of Emulation even among the very <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>It is a GOD full of Mercy, for ever darting out the Beams of His Love to Mankind, who has first Excited you, and thereupon Assisted you, for the <HI>Propagation</HI> of His <HI>Religion</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="002246_0072_0FDAD8E1B9ECF6D8"/>which wherever it is Preach'd &amp; own'd, it fetches out of the Grave, a World buried in its truly Miserable Corruption and Perdition, and Restores it unto that Life Eternal, which we have lost by the Apostasy of our First Parents, and our own.</P>
<P>'Tis the <HI>Religion</HI> which brings the chosen of GOD into the Blessedness unto which He has Chosen them; and opens &amp; sets up the King∣dom of GOD among the Nations. 'Tis the <HI>Religion</HI> that brings in Faithful Subjects and Souldiers for the Lord of Hosts, and builds up <HI>Living Tempels</HI> for GOD, which are far more precious than any that are but Artificial and Inanimate. This <HI>Religion</HI> it is, that In∣vites and fetches down <HI>Heaven</HI> to the <HI>Earth,</HI> and prepares the Inhabitants of the <HI>Earth</HI> to be received into the most Blessed Mansions of <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>A Work, How Illustrious! How Celestial! How Sublime! Oh! Thrice and four times Happy they, who are Ministers of GOD in such a Work! Happy, tho' never so much harass'd with Labours, and Watchings, and Perpetual Troubles! <HI>Happy beyond all Ex∣pression, did they but know their own Happiness!</HI></P>
<P>This Ministry, Suppose it a Load which even the <HI>Backs of Angels</HI> may tremble at; yet it is a work, which the <HI>Wings of Angels</HI> would
<PB N="64" REF="002246_0074_0FDAD8E8C16DB900"/>be with the highest Flights and Joys applied unto: Yea, and a work, in which the Mini∣sters who Execute the Pleasure &amp; Command of GOD, with Essays to have <HI>His Kingdom ruling over all;</HI> These not only are a sort of Competitors with the <HI>Angels,</HI> but also in these Essays Enjoy them for their Companions and Coadjutors.</P>
<P>Great and Grievous and never enough to be bewailed, has been the Scandal given in the Churches of the Reformation; in that so very little, yea, next to nothing, has been done in them, for the Propagation of a <HI>Faith,</HI> which breathes nothing but the most unex∣ceptionable Wisdom and Goodness; and by which the Kingdom of GOD comes down into a World, which Satan Reigning every where in it, Possesses and Oppresses, with how direful Chains of his upon it! While at the same time, the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> strives with an Unwearied and Extravagant Labour, to Pro∣pagate the Idolatry and Superstition of <HI>Anti∣christ,</HI> and advance the Empire of Satan. And the Missionaries and Brokers of that Har∣lot, are indeed more than can be numbred. The Zeal of those Panders, how Ardent is it! Their Attempts, how never tired! Their Travels how very tedious! And with what an Ardour are they Ambitious of a <HI>Crown,</HI> which appears to them a True Martyrdom, &amp; for the Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="002246_0076_0FDAD8EA17812A88"/>
But Blessed be the Name of our GOD, in that He hath inclined the Minds of some E∣minent Persons, to take away such a Scandal, and instigated them to roll off this Reproach from us. And among these, if any <HI>have done vertuously,</HI> You, O <HI>Malabcrian</HI> Missionaries, (which I would Speak, not for the Flattering of you, but as Admiring the Divine Grace which has assisted you!) <HI>You have excelled them all.</HI></P>
<P>The Report of your Mission and of your Diligence, hath reached from the Eastern even to the Western <HI>Indies.</HI> And what the Grace of Heaven has helped you to do, to∣wards the producing of a Christian People among the <HI>Indians,</HI> is heard among the <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Christians, with the highest Praises of∣fered up to GOD on the occasion, and <HI>as cool waters to our Thirsty Souls</HI> is the <HI>Good News from a far Country.</HI></P>
<P>Being Invited by your most Courteous and Christian Letters to me, and being a most hearty well-wisher to your Enterprizes for the Enlargement of the Church, I am willing to declare, in a few words, and with the Mo∣desty which becomes me, what my Appre∣hensions are concerning the <HI>Glorious</HI> and <HI>Weighty</HI> Affair which you have upon your hands.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="002246_0078_0FDAD8EB538F8D98"/>
And in the <HI>First</HI> Place, this is the very <HI>First born</HI> of my Wishes; nor is there any thing that I more wish, or have more Earnest desires for, than this: That all the Servants of GOD, who <HI>Do and Endure</HI> many Things for the <HI>Evangelizing</HI> of the World may Exhibit unto the whole World the <HI>Pure Maxims</HI> of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> and would Preach un∣to the Nations, the <HI>Weightier Matters of the Gospel,</HI> and the <HI>Wheat</HI> well cleansed from the <HI>Chaff,</HI> and from those <HI>Lesser Matters,</HI> where∣about Good Men, may and often do, carry on their Disputations.</P>
<P>'Tis most certain, That the <HI>Christian Reli∣gion</HI> is no other than the Doctrine of Li∣ving to GOD by CHRIST; and is a <HI>Practical Thing</HI> rather than a meer <HI>Theory;</HI> the Inten∣tion whereof is, to animate a Real, Solid, Vital PIETY, and Call forth such as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>dead</HI> in their Sins, unto a <HI>Godly,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Sober,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Righteous</HI> Life.</P>
<P>'Tis most certain, That in the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI> which is indeed a Doctrine of PIETY, there are sundry <HI>Practical Articles,</HI> in which all the <HI>Children of GOD</HI> are United; and they who seriously and sincerely Coalesce in this <HI>Union</HI> are to be reckoned among the <HI>Children of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>It is very certain, That these few Articles of <HI>Practical Piety,</HI> being first offered and well
<PB N="67" REF="002246_0080_0FDAD8F171A847C0"/>Received, the <HI>Mind</HI> thus <HI>Healed,</HI> will now make a Righter and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uller Judgment, of those <HI>Lesser Matters,</HI> upon which Good Men have many, mischievous and marvellous Con∣troversies. <HI>The love of GOD will Enlighten the Mind that has it;</HI> And indeed they that manage Controversies, do on both sides make a profession of Zeal to maintain these <HI>Articles of Practical Godliness.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore is the One Thing, which I earnestly Request of you; That you first of all propound unto the Nations among whom you <HI>abound in the work of the Lord,</HI> these <HI>Arti∣cles of the First Magnitude,</HI> wherein <HI>True Christianity</HI> does Firstly and Chiefly consist.</P>
<P>In the <HI>First</HI> Place; The One GOD, who Subsisteth in <HI>Three Persons,</HI> the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> and who in the Beginning did <HI>Create</HI> the World; is to be Em∣braced and Adored for OUR GOD. It must be the <HI>Principal Aim</HI> of our Life, in all things to yield <HI>Obedience</HI> unto Him. And it must be our most hearty Care, to Avoid every Thing which His Light shining in our Soul shall condemn as an Evil Thing.</P>
<P>In the Next Place; The CHRIST, who is the Eternal SON of GOD Incarnate in our Blessed JESUS, is our only <HI>Redeemer;</HI> who Dying for us, has offered a most Acceptable
<PB N="68" REF="002246_0082_0FDAD8F6873A8E30"/><HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the Divine Justice, on which re∣lying by <HI>Faith</HI> we become Reconciled unto GOD; and under the Conduct of Him who being received up into the Heavens, now Reigns on the Throne of GOD, we are to ex∣pect a wonderful and unspeakable Blessedness for our <HI>Immortal Soul,</HI> whereto our <HI>Body</HI> shall be Re-united in a Glorious <HI>Resurrection,</HI> when He shall <HI>Return</HI> unto us to <HI>Judge the World.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly; Being filled with the Love of GOD and of CHRIST, we must most Heartily Love our <HI>Neighbours;</HI> and for ever go by that Gol∣den Rule, <HI>Whatsoever you would have Men do unto you, do you even the same unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is that PURE CHRISTIANITY, which when it shall be by the Trumpets of GOD purely and plainly Preached unto the Nations, the Preachers will doubtless have GOD smiling upon them; <HI>The Hand of the Lord will be with them; and many will Believe, and be turned unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>The Hand of the Lord!</HI> What is it, but that SPIRIT of GOD, without whose Aids, they that would <HI>Build the House of the Lord,</HI> will but <HI>Labour in Vain?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis indeed with a very Trembling Heart, and not without the most profound Submis∣sion, that I would now hint a matter to you,
<PB N="69" REF="002246_0084_0FDAD8F81017FEC0"/>or at least insinuate it with a whisper hardly to be uttered. Some eminently Learned Men, Persons of the most finished Erudition, and the farthest in the World from all Fanaticism, are of this Perswasion; That the <HI>Reformation</HI> and <HI>Propagation</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> will be accom∣plished, by Granting over again, those <HI>Extra∣ordinary Gifts of the Prophetic Spirit,</HI> by which the Holy Spirit watered the Primitive Church, and at first spread and confirmed the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>The most Holy SPIRIT of GOD has used this Method from the very beginning of the World; that so He might communicate the Light, with which He would lead His People travelling on the <HI>Earth,</HI> to the <HI>Rest</HI> which the Saints have in the Heavens reserved for them. It hath seemed Good unto Him, to send down from on High, into the Children of Men, those <HI>Good Angels,</HI> who have always been the most proper and ready Instruments of the <HI>Eternal Spirit</HI> for such a Purpose; and the Favourites of GOD, who have been so managed and inspired by <HI>Angels,</HI> have been the Messengers and Proclaimers, by whom He has revealed His Will both in Word and Wri∣ting, to the Children of Men. Various a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wondrous have been the Operations of the <HI>Angels</HI> in these Ministers of GOD; but <HI>all
<PB N="70" REF="002246_0086_0FDAD8FE2F931F78"/>these things worketh that one and self-same Spirit, who divides to every Man severally as He pleases.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Angelical</HI> Possession and <HI>Energy</HI> of the <HI>Prophetic Spirit,</HI> has ever been to the People of GOD as a <HI>Light shining in a dark place;</HI> A Place, alas, how <HI>Dark,</HI> how buried in <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI> would it have been, if it had not been allowed unto this our World; for to Rejoyce in the Consolation of such a Light! The Immense <HI>Treasures of Truth,</HI> which we have treasured up for us in the Sacred Scriptures, we confess to be owing unto this <HI>Prophetic Spirit;</HI> yea, 'tis owing to the Afflations there∣of, that the Church is continued against all the Hazards and Horrors of Extinction, tho' it be like a little spark in the midst of a Tempestuous Ocean.</P>
<P>For Four Hundred Years before the Incar∣nation of our SAVIOUR, there was a Cea∣sing and Silence of this <HI>Prophetic Spirit.</HI> But when that Great KING Ascending on High, <HI>Sat down on the Right Hand of the most High GOD,</HI> He received <HI>Gifts,</HI> which He gave unto Men, and He sent down into the <HI>Prea∣chers of the Everlasting Gospel,</HI> the <HI>Angels,</HI> who were all <HI>made Subject</HI> unto Him; and He Distilled a most <HI>Plentiful Shower</HI> of the Hea∣venly Gifts, with which He <HI>Refreshed His weary Heritage.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002246_0088_0FDAD9011A042BE8"/>
For more than Two Hundred Years after this, the Church was Enlarged and Governed by these Gifts of the <HI>Prophetic Spirit;</HI> and the Church enjoy'd a sensible presence of her <HI>Be∣loved</HI> with her. But when the <HI>Carnal Spirit of this World,</HI> fermented with the Venom of the <HI>Epicurean Philosophy,</HI> entred into the Church, and she would no more acknowledge her SAVIOUR as her Governour, the Grieved <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let</HI> withdrew, and there Succeeded a Kingdom animated with the Unclean Spirit of Antichrist; and <HI>for Three Years and Six Months,</HI> the <HI>Rain</HI> is witheld, from a Land Languishing under the <HI>Indignation of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But now at last; what if after the <HI>Twelve Hundred &amp; Sixty</HI> Years of <HI>Anrichrist</HI> are Ex∣pired, there should be heard the <HI>Sound of A∣bundance of Rain!</HI> What if the <HI>Dove</HI> sent forth <HI>Twice</HI> and Returning again, should go forth a <HI>Third Time,</HI> never to Return any more; and Abide with us, until the <HI>Flood</HI> of Ignorance and Wickedness in which the whole World at this day lies in a manner drowned, shall go off wholly from the face of the Earth? What if the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> should come, with the Joy of the Holy SPIRIT, working with such <HI>Gifts</HI> and in such <HI>Ways,</HI> as He has promised, for both the <HI>Internal</HI> &amp; <HI>External</HI> Propagation of His Gospel? Whether it shall be so or no; —<HI>I know not, GOD knows!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="002246_0090_0FDAD902E6D2D7C0"/>
It is very sure, That the Prophecy in <HI>Joel, I will pour cut my SPIF IT upon all Flesh,</HI> yet remains to be accomplished. And it is not unlikely, That the <HI>Effasion of the SPIRIT,</HI> by which the <HI>Primitive Church</HI> flourshed, might be but as <HI>Drops,</HI> which will be follow'd with <HI>Mighty Showers,</HI> for the Accomplishment of this Prophecy still to be Expected <HI>in the Latter Days.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord will <HI>Consume</HI> the most wicked <HI>Antichrist,</HI> by the <HI>Breath of His Mouth,</HI> and will <HI>Destroy</HI> him with the <HI>Brightness of His Coming.</HI> What if by the <HI>Breath of His Mouth,</HI> we should understand such <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT, as He signified unto His Disciples, when with His <HI>Mouth</HI> He <HI>breathed</HI> on them, and said, <HI>Receive an Holy Spirit?</HI></P>
<P>I Confess. That the <HI>Extraordinary Gifts</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT are to be less esteemed of, than that <HI>Quickening Grave,</HI> by which all that have their Names written in the Book of Life, are <HI>Ordinarily</HI> Sanctified, and Live unto their GOD.

<HEAD>To the most REVEREND, the most <HI>Learned,</HI> most <HI>Faithful,</HI> and most <HI>Vigilant</HI> Pastor of a Church in <HI>America,</HI> the most beloved Helper in CHRIST, Most hearty Salutations.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM Your Letters, which you wrote on the Thirty-first of <HI>December,</HI> in the Year 1717. I could not but observe in the first place, That You are a Person ador∣ned with a Mind agreeable to JESUS CHRIST, and suitably walking in the power of His Spirit; And One the Care of whose Heart it is, that the work of GOD for the Conversion &amp; Salvation of Souls, may be well-founded, and continually make Improve∣ments, not only with you in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but also that the same work with us in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> may be daily on the growing hand; Yea, that it may get into the Minds of all far and near; whereby a People deluded by the craft of Satan, may be soon brought from their Idolatry into the True Worship of GOD; and forsaking their Pagods, may make it their Main Intention, that their Hearts being full of Faith, the most Holy GOD may dwell as in His Temple there.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="002246_0098_0FDAD90C8D62B648"/>
That this affair, tho' it be yet struggling in its Infancy, should nevertheless excite in you, most Reverend Sir, upon your hearing of what GOD is doing here, so much of Joy, and of Delight, and of Good Will, We cannot but render our Greatest Thanks unto GOD, who has been pleased to give us the Friendship of such a Man; Yea and that besides you, there should be others of the like Mind and Heart with you, whose Piety disposes them to re∣joyce with us, in such Beginnings as are al∣ways attended with some Grievous Difficul∣ties; and more than this, with their Pray∣ers and Counsils Labour to open a more hap∣py and easy way for the Progress of the work which the present Mission is concerned for.</P>
<P>Most Reverend Sir, You directed your Let∣ters in the first place to the Blessed Mr. <HI>Zie∣genbalgh,</HI> and his Colleague. But it has plea∣sed GOD to recal him home from the Vine∣yard sooner than any of us look'd for; so that upon me who alone survive the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whole Care and Load of this Mission, and of Writing to you, which I do with deepest Sorrow, the Account of his Death; wich happened on the Twenty Third day of <HI>February,</HI> in the Year, 1719. Heavenly Joys encompass him while we are here drowned in Tears. But going, whither the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="77" REF="002246_0100_0FDAC95079F31928"/>of GOD have carried him. The Lord of the Harvest has called him away from the Labour of a Mission heavy &amp; weighty enough; has dismissed him, has accepted him; has introduced him into, and begun to refresh him with, Eternal Consolations. And now since 'tis so, what remains as my Duty, is with your Leave, to impart unto you such things as these at the present, by way of An∣swer to your Letters to Mr. <HI>Ziegenbalgh.</HI></P>
<P>That Man of Blessed Memory is much wanted in the Work of this Mission.</P>
<P>First, For his singular Diligence and Vigi∣lance, with which he governed this Work of the Mission.</P>
<P>Then, For the most frequent Conferences, which he maintained with the People, upon Salvation to be expected from CHRIST alone.</P>
<P>Lastly, For the Translation of the Word of GOD into the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue of this People; — For indeed in all these things, the Lord adorned him very much with the Gifts as well of Nature as of Grace, for the singular Service of gathering a Church unto Him.</P>
<P>As a Remembrance of this Worthy Man, and as a Testimony to the Truth of what I say, <HI>Sir,</HI> I here present you with the <HI>New Testament</HI> in the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue; together
<PB N="78" REF="002246_0102_0FDAC951D76BE538"/>with some little Books written concerning True Christianity; all which you will take in good part; and I pray you kindly to ac∣cept them as a small present from such as would render you very great Thanks for the Books which were sent hither from you.</P>
<P>Those Presents of Gold from your young Gentlemen, I have Distributed unto the Youth in our Charity Schools. GOD the best Re∣warder, will render to every one according to his Work. And, that GOD would more and more adorn the Souls of these Young Gen∣tlemen with a Clothing of wrought Gold; This is what is in the Prayers and Hopes of our Youth for them; who also render very great Thanks unto their Benefactors.</P>
<P>In the mean time, While these things are doing, and while <HI>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh</HI> leaves Earth for Heaven, a Merciful GOD has remembred His Work of this Mission here in the midst of all its Troubles. For through His Governing Providence at the same time three Candidates for the Mission are sent unto us; who being endued with true Piety, in∣dustriously spend all their Time in Learning the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue. And so, as soon as they have attained a Competent Skill in this <HI>Malabarick</HI> Language, there will be Four of us who are principally employed in the
<PB N="79" REF="002246_0104_0FDAD90DD5325888"/>Conversion of the Nations, endeavouring to bring them out of Darkness into the True Worship of GOD. But since the Harvestof the Lord here is Great, and Four Missionaries are not enough, we have in this Year made known our Desires to the Curators of the Mission in <HI>Europe,</HI> about sending over Four Candidates more unto us; making in the mean time our most humble Supplication unto our GOD, that He would please anon to send yet more Labourers to us in this His so very large an Harvost.</P>
<P>That Method of proceeding which you have been pleased to supply us withal, we have Entertained with the highest Satis∣faction; Receiving in it, as a Testimony that JESUS CHRIST is Preached among you with all Sincerity; and indeed, which is to us the greatest pleasure that can be, in the very same Method, that we our selves make use of here, in treating with Men about the Sal∣vation of their Souls; laying aside those things which are Matters of meer Opinion, and wholly applying our selves to This, That CHRIST alone, without any manner of Dis∣guise, may be Propounded and Exhibited. That Method of ours in Proposing the Doctrine of the Gospel unto the Nations, does, to tell in short, consist in these things.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="002246_0106_0FDAD9180666B3D0"/>
First, We Declare to these Heathens, One only True GOD, who has manifested Himself in Three Persons: Fairly Noting to them therewithal, what Blessings each Person has given forth to Men, &amp; will bestow upon them.</P>
<P>Next, We treat of Man, considering him according to his Fourfold State; while we show, in how Blessed a State he was, while he yet shone with the Image of GOD which was Concreated with him: Then, How, or in what way, he lost that Image of GOD, and put on the Visage of Satan, and of his own Accord run headlong into wickedness.</P>
<P>Next, How GOD sent His most Beloved and Only Son into the World, that he might bring us by Repentance out of that Cursed State, unto which every one is by Nature liable, into a State of Grace; that so being transla∣ted into a State of Grace, we may be willing to have the Image of GOD recovered in our Souls; seeking for our Righteousness in CHRIST alone, by Faith, which working by love, we may carefully walk on in a life pure from Vices, and in the daily Exercise of God∣liness; and grow more and more into the Likeness and Resemblance of our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Lastly, We Inculcate this, That only they, who in this Life, do by CHRIST, pass into a State of Grace, with a True Change of Mind
<PB N="81" REF="002246_0108_0FDAD91907438328"/>upon them, and persevere in Faith to the End; These only may partake in the Hope of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; which is our Eternal Blessedness.</P>
<P>We every where keep to this Order of Sal∣vation; so that not only in the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue, when we speak to the <HI>Damuleans,</HI> but also in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue, when we tender the Word of GOD, unto such as are of a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Original, or to Slaves that have Christian Masters, yea, or unto <HI>Europeans</HI> in the <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Tongue, we for ever oblige our selves in this manner to deliver it. For which cause, whatever is done among us, in Preaching, or in Teaching, or in Examining, or in our most private Conferences, All still is Entirely Levell'd at this Mark, that we may admonish and Excite and quicken Men, unto a True Repentance, unto a Living Faith, unto an Undissembled Piety; At the same time calling upon GOD with most ardent Prayers, that He would thrust forth such Mis∣sionaries, whose chief concern it shall be, that the Sheep may be led unto that best of Pastures, which is with JESUS CHRIST, and be refreshed from none but the pure Fountain of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Daily Experience has hitherto taught us, that by the advantage of <HI>Catechists,</HI> we may
<PB N="82" REF="002246_0110_0FDAD9200C7CA7C0"/>do very much Good, not only upon the Members of the Church themselves, but also upon those that are without. Wherefore upon the Observation of This, we do all we can, that by the Word of Truth we may pre∣pare such Catechists for us, who having a Good Foundation laid in the Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, may both arrive to a Spi∣ritual Experience, and may be made fit from hence to teach others in the Doctrine of JE∣SUS CHRIST, and give them a Lively De∣monstration of it. We have Seven such Ca∣techists, with whom we manage, a <HI>Biblical Exercise,</HI> an <HI>Exegetical,</HI> and a <HI>Theological.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Biblical</HI> Exercise, we take some whole Book, of the New Testament; where∣in we show them, what Parts are in every Chapter; Afterwards we go thro' the Parts; and the Catechists themselves fetch out from thence, certain Doctrines joyned with some Application of them. But when they come to Declare things, they proceed after this manner. First, they Expound the Mat∣ters, and the Context. Then, This being done, they apply to the proper Edification of the Soul, those things that appear to be most Subservient unto it. But by this Method, that which is principally aimed at, is, partly that they may get a more Solid, and a Stable
<PB N="83" REF="002246_0112_0FDAD9214B9F3458"/>Knowledge of the Truth, out of the Sacred Scriptures; and partly that they may get into a greater Ability for Preaching when they shall have Opportunity to Speak any where, yea, anon to propound the Truth of GOD among the Nations.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Exegetical</HI> Exercise, we hitherto handle only particular Sentences of the Bi∣ble; wherein supplying them with an Expo∣sition according to the Rules of Interpreta∣tion, we fetch out certain Positions which are to the point in hand; and when we have in some orderly manner opened such a Sentence; they taking Notes hereof in writing, we leave them to their own Meditations. Whence it commonly comes to pass, that the Things which they have thus Meditated by themselves, they recite by Heart on the Lords∣day, and offer them as a Sermon for the Publick.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Theological</HI> Exercise, we show them first the Fundamental Theses, in all the Ar∣ticles of our Faith: And then we bring the strongest Proofs for them, from Sentences of the Scripture. And that we may serve this End the better, we have written a certain Compendium of Divinity, of an <HI>Octavo</HI> form, in the Tongue of this <HI>Damulic</HI> Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="002246_0114_0FDAD922C85E1AE8"/>
May our most Gracious GOD, the Father of Mercies, Grant that these <HI>Catechists</HI> may in this way be so prepared, that even from These there may be chosen those, who may hereafter in the quality of Missionaries, take the work of this Mission into their manage∣ment.</P>
<P>Our Main Study is of this Tendency; That the Number of these may increase more and more; Upon which we enter into a most certain Hope, that in the Church, and among the Nations, by their Means, we shall one day see much Advantage and a mighty Har∣vest.</P>
<P>Of these, there is One already placed as a Ruler to a little Church in a certain Vil∣lage. To Others we have given the Deno∣mination of <HI>Elders;</HI> to others that of <HI>Exhor∣ters;</HI> whose Office 'tis often to Visit the Members of the Church from House to House; Instruct them, Advise them, and joyn in Prayers with them; And finally, the Office of others, is, That upon such as are to be Converted, and upon the Catechumens, they may <HI>Viva Voce,</HI> inculcate the most Substan∣tial Foundations of Christianity; and so, having first laid those Foundations, then strive to get up higher with them.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="002246_0116_0FDAD92C344C3AB8"/>
If GOD please to Smile upon it, we have a Mind also, to make a Dictionary, in the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue, which may be of use to the <HI>Europeans</HI> as well as to this Nation. Every Page is to be divided into three Sections. In the first Plat, we place the <HI>Damulick</HI> words; the Primitive, and what is to be appendiced unto them. In the second, over against the <HI>Malabarian</HI> words, we place the Pronuncia∣tion of them in Latin Characters close by their side. In the third, we Express the sig∣nification thereof in Latin.</P>
<P>In our Schools, where all things are dis∣pensed upon free-cost, there are fourscore Children daily fed; Enjoying such Victuals and Garments as may be necessary for them. Unto the rest, there is most willingly allow∣ed the Benefit of Instruction, and such Books as they may want, without their paying of any thing for it.</P>
<P>Our Press is now every day at work upon the <HI>Old Testament</HI> in the <HI>Damulick</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>Our Paper-Mill here, yields us as much Paper as we have daily occasion for.</P>
<P>As to the Popish Missions in this our <HI>India,</HI> they are thought more Numerous than ours; insomuch that they say, there are no less than Two Thousand who here go to and fro in the Earth: But, alas, the deluded Heathen
<PB N="86" REF="002246_0118_0FDAD92D483B7BA0"/>People, is translated out of Darkness into Darkness, and from one Idolatry to another, without the least sense of the Good that in a CHRIST is to be met withal: That I may not say, Paganism is wickedly grafted into Popery.</P>
<P>The Word of GOD abundantly declares, That in the Latter Days there must arise Witnesses of the Truth, endued with the <HI>Gifts of Miracles.</HI> And since that thread-bare say∣ing of Divines in the Church, <HI>Dona Miracu∣losa dantur propter Infideles,</HI> is a Truth shining with its own indisputable Rays; we do allow, That to facilitate His work in the Conversion of the Pagans, our GOD may crown it with these Extraordinary Helps to it; and may furnish His Missionaries with so great Powers, and bestow the Gifts of Miracles upon them. However these things we wholly leave with the Grace, and Mercy, and Providence of Heaven; the best Dispenser of all.</P>
<P>That which I now desire, is, That the Correspondence by Letters, which you have begun with us, may be still kindly continu∣ed; so that the <HI>East</HI> may talk with the <HI>West,</HI> and the <HI>West</HI> may manifest unto the <HI>East,</HI> its Desires, and the works of GOD. Yea, that they may stir up each other in the course of
<PB N="87" REF="002246_0120_0FDAD9368A40DCD8"/>the Gospel; quicken each other with their Prayers; push on each other in the way to Heaven; give to each other the Admoniti∣ons of Patience; and Confirm each other in the Hope that is our Life.</P>
<P>May our Heavenly Father, plentifully grant unto you, most Reverend Sir, from the overflowing Fulness of His CHRIST, Strength, and Light, and Happiness; that in all your works you may Perceive and Ad∣mire the Blessing of the Lord. Farewel in the Lord. I commend my self to your Fa∣therly Love and Prayers; Being,</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The present Condition of the</HI> Indians <HI>on</HI> Martha's Vineyard, <HI>Extracted from an Account of Mr.</HI> Experience Mayhew, <HI>newly Published; From whence the present Condition of the rest may be apprchended.</HI></P>
<P>COncerning the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> on these Islands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative writ∣ten by <HI>Matthew Mayhew,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Eldest Son of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> who first Preached the Gospel unto them; which Narrative was Prin∣ted at <HI>Boston</HI> in the Year 1694. and Reprinted at <HI>London</HI> the next Year, under the Title of, <HI>The Con∣quest and Triumphs of Grace,</HI> &amp;c. The same for Sub∣stance, being again Printed some Years after, in Dr. <HI>C. Mather</HI>'s History of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall begin my Account of the State of the <HI>In∣dians</HI> from the time the said Book was first Publish∣ed, that being about the time that I first began to Preach to them.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> on these Islands is very much diminished, since the <HI>English</HI> first settled on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> which was in the Year 1642, there being then as was supposed on that Island about 1500 Souls. At present there are in the <HI>Vineyard</HI> six small Villages, containing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</P>
<P>Each of these Villages is provided with an <HI>Indi∣an</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="002246_0122_0FDAD93802FDABB8"/>Preacher to dispence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Worship of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, sing a Psalm; then there is a Sermon Preached on some Portion of Scrip∣ture, which being ended, they sing again, while the Days be of a sufficient length; and then con∣clude with Prayer.</P>
<P>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the several Villages might be provided with School Masters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet some of them have not been so constantly supplied, as is to be desired; and gene∣rally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Children from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and so the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progress in Learning: Nevertheless, I think the greatest number can Read, either in the <HI>English</HI> or in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue; and some in both.</P>
<P>There is also care taken to <HI>Catechise</HI> the Youth: For besides what is done in this kind, by the <HI>Indian</HI> School-Masters &amp; Preachers, I frequently examine the Young People my self, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fortnight, in some or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Me∣thod will, I hope, prove very advantageous: many grown People as well as Children, attending these Exercises.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Church at <HI>Marth</HI>'s-<HI>Vineyard,</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>Japhet Hannit</HI> an excellent <HI>Indian Minister</HI> was formerly the Pastor, but died in the Year 1712, had after his Death another Pastor, called <HI>Sowomog:</HI> but he being an Old Man when he was first called
<PB N="90" REF="002246_0123_0FDAD9732AFEF540"/>unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</P>
<P>The Name of the present Pastor of that Church is <HI>Joash Pann,</HI> who is a very serious prudent and pious Man, of a good Conversation, and one who drinks no strong drink, but is much grieved at those of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it please GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good Instrument; but being lately fallen into a Languishing Distemper, I fear what the issue of it may be.</P>
<P>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. The most of these are Inhabitants of <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> but not all; there being a few that have joyned themselves there unto, not only from <HI>Elsabeth</HI>'s Islands, but from the Main Land also, lying next unto the <HI>Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Administredin that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Dis∣cipline is in some measure kept up in it. Unto this End, besides other Church Meetings, there is constantly on the <HI>Thursday</HI> or <HI>Friday</HI> before that Sa∣crament is Administred, a Meeting of the Church, wherein such are suspended from the Lord's Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due satisfaction. At this Meeting also there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached suitable to the occasion.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged, that as the <HI>Indians</HI> are many of them much addicted unto strong drink; so some of the Members of the Indian Church have been sometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is also true, that such as these have generally appeared very Penitent. And tho' some have fallen quite away, and so have been cut off by the Sword
<PB N="91" REF="002246_0124_0FDAD939DE45EC78"/>of Discipline; yet others thro' the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace of GOD, have been so far recovered out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and still are, a considerable number, whose Conversation is, so far as I can understand, very blameless, and who may be justly looked upon as Exemplary Christians; what ever such <HI>English Men</HI> as are filled with Prejudices against the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> may say to the contrary.</P>
<P>Some Years after I first began to Preach to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> did on a day of <HI>Fasting &amp; Prayer</HI> appointed for that End, so∣lemnly renew their Covenant with GOD, engaging to endeavour to forsake those Sins with which they confessed they were too easily beset; and there was after this, for a Time, some Reformation: but I ob∣served that two or three of the Brethren that could not be perswaded to joyn in the Action, soon after fell into Scandalous Misdemeanours.</P>
<P>I also observed, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> seemed for a time to be attended with more of the Presence of GOD, and the Influ∣ences of His Spirit, than they were before, or have been since.</P>
<P>It was then frequent to see Persons at the Hear∣ing of Sermons, very much affected, and some times as soon as Sermon was ended, there would stand up several, one after another, and make very Penitential Confessions of their Sins, with Promises to endea∣vour to Live new Lives: desiring also the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</P>
<P>About this time there joyned in full Communion
<PB N="92" REF="002246_0125_0FDAD97549043270"/>unto that small Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> in one Year, at least 30 Persons, the behavour of many of whom did very much resemble that of the Jailor, at his Conversion, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. GOD shewing us herein that He can make the <HI>Indians</HI> as well as Others a <HI>willing People in the Day of His Power.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Increase of Knowledge among these <HI>Indians,</HI> tho' it must be confessed that their progress herein is but slow, by reason of the want of a Learned Ministry constantly to Instruct them. Their ordi∣nary Preachers having but little Learning, and are not so able to seed them with Knowledge &amp; Under∣standing as is to be desired; yet some of these have Gifts not to be despised in <HI>a day of small things.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Indian</HI> Ministers as they are Members in full Communion of the Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> so they do not engage in the work of the Ministry without the Consent &amp; Approbation of that Church, as well as of the <HI>English</HI> Ministers that Preach unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> and have an Inspection over them.</P>
<P>Having now Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> upward of 25 Years, I have never yet had any special charge of any one single Congregation committed to me; but have visited the several fore mentioned Assem∣blies alternately, as I have thought most necessary; Preaching ordinarily, unto some or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; constantly also attending their Church-Meetings, to assist &amp; direct them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> when they are Sick, generally send for their Ministers, and sometimes other Christians with them, to visit them, and Pray with, and for them. I have some times been with them on such occasions, and heard them profess a great concern
<PB N="93" REF="002246_0126_0FDAD9440516BC00"/>about their Souls; declaring that they did not re∣gard any thing in this World, so they might obtain an Interest in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have professed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved themselves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah Torrey,</HI> Pastor of the <HI>English</HI> Church in <HI>Tisbury</HI> on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> has also for many Years past Preached as a Lecturer unto the <HI>Indians</HI> on that Island, having for that End learned their Language. He Preach∣eth in some or other of their Assemblies once a Fort∣night, and goes frequently to their Church-Meetings, to advise &amp; assist them; so that the <HI>Indians</HI> have a Ser∣mon every <HI>Thursday</HI> Preached to them, either by Mr. <HI>Torrey,</HI> or my self: And we strengthen the hands of one another, by going together to these Weekly Exercises.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Wiswall</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Edgartown,</HI> has also now almost learned the <HI>Indians</HI> Tongue, with a design to do what Service he can a∣mong that People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard</HI> &amp; the adjacent Islands, do hitherto understand the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue much better than that of the <HI>English;</HI> and therefore complain much for want of <HI>Indian</HI> BIBLES, having now but very few among there. Nor are there any to be had; the last Edition being now gone. These <HI>Indians</HI> are therefore very desirous of mother Impression of the BIBLE, if it might be obtained; and divers of hem have told me, as well as some of those on <HI>Nantucket,</HI> (whom I have divers times visited) that they should be willing accor∣ding to their capacity, to contribute to it.</P>
<P>But the disadvantage which the <HI>Indians</HI> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is some what helped by the Care of the Honourable Commissioners to supply them with other useful Books in their own Language, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>N. England</HI> Confession of Faith; Several Catechisms;
<PB N="94" REF="002246_0127_0FDAD97C21FCF938"/>The Practice of Piety; Mr. <HI>Shepard's</HI> Sincere Convert; Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to the Unconverted. And several Ser∣mons of Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s, &amp;c. besides the Psalter, &amp; the Gos∣pel of JOHN, Printed in the Year 1709. And the <HI>Indian</HI> Primer Printed this Year, in <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> All which Books are now very useful unto them.</P>
<P>As to their Civil Government, the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Dukes</HI> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <HI>English;</HI> But because their State does yet somewhat differ from that of their <HI>English</HI> Neighbours, there are se∣veral Laws made by the General Court of this <HI>Province,</HI> with a particular regard to the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of the same: And there are some <HI>English</HI> Justices especially Commissionated to take care of the <HI>Indians</HI> Inhabiting the several Counties of it: and <HI>these</HI> are directed to No∣mainate and Appoint several Officers among the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves, to assist under their regulation, in the Government of that People.</P>
<P>There are yet but few <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's. Vineyard</HI> that have Houses of the <HI>English</HI> fashion, tho' the number of these is of late increased; but in respect of their Apparel, they are generally Cloathed as the <HI>English</HI> are, &amp; they by degrees learn the <HI>English</HI> way of Husbandry: Several of them have good Teams of Oxen, with which they Plough and Cart, for themselves &amp; Neighbours, as the <HI>English</HI> do. Many of them have also <HI>Horses, Cows, Sheep &amp; Swine.</HI> They have also among them some that have learned Trades; as at <HI>Martha's-Vineyard</HI> there are several <HI>Weavers,</HI> One or two <HI>House-Carpenters,</HI> One <HI>Wheel-wright,</HI> who is so good a Work-man, as to be frequently employed by his <HI>English</HI> Neighbours. There are several <HI>Tailors,</HI> &amp; one if not more <HI>Shoe-makers,</HI> and one <HI>Black smith,</HI> who not only took his Trade himself, but also made his Bellows, &amp; other Tools; and one <HI>Cooper, viz. William Charles,</HI> who is a good Work∣man. And tho' some of these may not be so accurate as our <HI>English</HI> Trades-men, yet this shews that as the <HI>Indians</HI> are capable of Learning such Callings as <HI>English Men</HI> follow; so they begin to come to it.</P>
