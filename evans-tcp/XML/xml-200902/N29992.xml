Whereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bent my Mind very intently and with diligent Watchfulness &amp; Circumspection, to attain to that Estate. But notwithstanding all which, upon a cu∣rious and strict Search and Examination, I found my self to be so far from being a God, that I was still a poor, frail and imperfect Man. Then I began to look about, to see if I could find any such Thing as a perfect Man, and more especially amongst those who most pretend to that Doctrine, and could find no Person to make the Subject of my Enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that I could with a due Regard to the Rule of Charity, se∣riously exempt from the just Imputation of humane Weakness, Frailty, and visible Imper∣fections: At which I was much startled, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egan to question thus: If this be the absolute
<PB N="5" REF="039860_0005_101491D8CDAD4050"/>Terms of Justification, I must draw this Con∣clusion, (with the Man to whom Christ ren∣der'd the Salvation of the rich as impossible) <HI>Who then can be saved?</HI> Then I saw my self led blindfold in the dark and pathless Wilderness of Confusion, at the End of which I could see nothing but Confusion and Destruction; until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t length it pleased God to open my Eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring me to a renewed Sight of my former Un∣derstanding and Faith again; <HI>viz.</HI> That in order to our Justification in the Sight of a pure &amp; per∣fect God, by his pure, just and perfect Law we must be absolutely pure &amp; perfect, as the Apostle says, <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing;</HI> that is to say, in Jesus Christ, by his imputing, reckoning, or accounting his perfect and spot∣less Righteousness, which he wrought out in his own Person, to be and belong to the faith∣ful People of God; not for any Righteousness done by them, but of his pure Grace and Fa∣vour, and to be received and laid hold of by the Hand of a divine, purifying, and fruitful Faith of Credence, Reliance, and absolute Depen∣dance.</P>
<P>And thus it pleased God to bring me out of this dark, and really dangerous Error, of ven∣turing my Justification and Salvation on the groundless Dependance upon a perfect Righte∣ousness, to be wrought out in me, contrary to the Doctrine and Promises of God in Christ,
<PB N="6" REF="039860_0006_101491DB4FEB2A30"/>and to set my feet once more in that safe and sure Way of Justification through the Righte∣ousness of God, by Faith in Jesus Christ. But as to my unstable and undetermined Thoughts and Scruples concerning some of the necessary Parts of external Duty aforementioned, it still at Times remained with me, until it pleased God to excite me to ask my self this Question, That inasmuch as I could not but own that those ex∣ternal Performances of Baptism, the Lord's Sup∣per, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were appointed and commanded by Je∣sus Christ in his last Will and Testament, how could I expect to be justifyed by him, when he shall come to judge the World, by the Rule of his own Gospel, if I persisted and continued thus to slight, undervalue, &amp; contemn as unnecessary and unprofitable, several particular Commands re∣quired in that Gospel. By this Means I was happily and timely cast before the final Tryal, and my Conscience fill'd with guilt and Con∣demnation, as a just Punishment for my unad∣vised Rashness. Then my Understanding came to me rectifyed again to see that those out∣ward Figures were commanded by the infinite∣ly wise Jesus, in order partly to try our Obe∣dience to his divine Authority, and partly to correspond and co-operate with the holy Scriptures, instrumentally to direct and guide our Faith and Understanding; the one doctri∣nally, and the other figuratively, to compre∣hend, propagate, and maintain that pure Sancti∣fication,
<PB N="7" REF="039860_0007_101491E00F7A5F30"/>obedient and spiritual Life, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tained by Jesus Christ. So that through the wonderful and undeserved Grace of God I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-established and confirmed upon a solid and tryed Understanding in, and Affection for, both the blessed Instrument the sacred Scriptures, and also those external Figures which the Ho∣ly Ghost, by their divine Voice, requires us to perform in an humble, dutiful, just and reaso∣nable Obedience and Submission to our dear Saviour Jesus Christ, our Law-giver, our King, and our Judge; and am experimentally taught to understand that if Satan cannot prevail with the Professors of Religion to lead them into one Extream, that is, to settle down upon a carnal Dependance on the Performance of the formal &amp; external Parts of Religion, so but that he finds their Minds will be examining into, and contemplating upon the mysterious &amp; spiritual Parts of it, then he often strives to lead them into an Extream on the contrary Hand, by sug∣gesting low, mean, diminutive Thoughts in them concerning the outward and formal Parts of the Gospel Religion, under the delusive and specious Pretence of magnifying the spiritual Parts of it, and thereby, if he can possibly pre∣vail upon us, make us to be justly guilty of di∣viding and separating that which Jesus Christ would have inseparably joined together; I mean, the inward Power, and outward Form of God∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness. So that upon a serious Experience of
