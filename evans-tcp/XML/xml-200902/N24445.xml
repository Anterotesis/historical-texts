</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y the words now before us, we are taught the following interesting les∣son, That having made use of all the means in our power, to guard against the evils to which we are exposed, our dependence must be placed on the Providence of God.</P>
<P>As this truth will apply universally, in all cases of danger and trouble, in the following Discourse I will call your attention to some of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly expo∣sed. I will then suggest a few considerations, tending to impress on our mind the important lesson expressed in the text.</P>
<P>In the first place, our attention shall be given to some of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly exposed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032358_0004_0FF1F0604C621310"/>
Large towns and cities are more exposed to the calamities of war, than less populous places.</P>
<P>People are invited to settle in towns and cities, by the advantages which they offer to commerce, to man∣ufactures, and the useful arts. The wealth of towns and cities bears a general proportion to their extent and population. In times of war, therefore, the largest towns and cities will be objects to which an enemy will give the first attention. The conquest of such places has a double effect: It weakens the country invaded, and by adding wealth to the conqueror, ena∣bles him to make farther depredations.</P>
<P>In all countries, where invading armies are success∣ful, large towns and cities have been exposed to the greatest calamities. I need not be particular in re∣peating instances. The historical part of the Bible,— the histories of modern nations, and of the age in which we live, are full of them.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more exposed to the calamities arising from sedition and rebellion, than less populous places.</P>
<P>Experience teaches, what indeed would be natural to expect, that the fermentation of party zeal has been more violent, and productive of more serious consequences in large towns and cities, than in small places. In towns and cities, men of restless temper and seditions spirits can have frequent communica∣tions; and having devised mischief, they can with more expedition and effect execute their purposes, than in places where accomplices are spread over a considerable space of country.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more exposed to infec∣tions and pestilential diseases, than less populous places.
<PB N="7" REF="032358_0005_0FF1F06206C31C10"/>In places crowded with inhabitants, the air which is inhaled, is charged with noxious vapours.</P>
<P>In some places, fatal disorders are generated by the action of heat on bodies capable of discharging a mor∣tal poison: In other places, if diseases of the worst kind are not generated, the constitutions of people may be predisposed to receive infection, when it is brought to them.</P>
<P>Those who make the healing art their study have noticed the malignancy of particular disorders, in par∣ticular parts of crowded cities.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more exposed to the rage of devouring flames, than smaller places. The dan∣ger from this evil may be considerably diminished by the use of such materials, in the construction of build∣ings, as will resist the flames: It is however next to impossible, to erect houses, fit to be inhabited, without having a certain portion of the materials, of a combus∣tible nature.</P>
<P>Such is the constitution and frame of our body, that it is equally necessary to guard against the effects of cold and damp habitations, as against the danger of fire: so that by carrying our caution to an extreme against fire, we might possibly expose ourselves to other evils fatal to our health and comfort. The danger of fire, however, cannot be too watchfully counteracted in a town like <HI>this,</HI> in which we live, where the greatest part of the buildings consist of materials highly com∣bustible. The danger is constantly before our eyes: we seldom pass a season, without beholding the habi∣tation of some of our neighbours and friends on fire. Although the destruction of property, by this dread∣ful enemy, has not been so great during the last twelve
<PB N="8" REF="032358_0006_0FF1F063D7FF7A78"/>months, as in some former seasons, the cry of fire has been unusually frequent since the year commenced, and attended, in some instances, with circumstances peculiarly alarming.</P>
<P>We add, once more, Large towns and cities are more exposed to incen∣diaries, and robbers, than smaller places.</P>
<P>In large towns, the proportion of abandoned char∣acters is greater, than in places more thinly inhabit∣ed. The basest of mankind find it more easy to hide themselves; and they find more opportunities to spend the fruits of their wickedness to their mind, in popu∣lous places, than in country villages.</P>
<P>To people in the industrious and peaceful walks of life, it will appear almost incredible, that any of the human race can be so vile as to break open your dwelling place when you are at rest, and rob you of the property which you have laid up for your comfort, and the comfort of those who depend on the fruits of your industry. But to the disgrace of human nature, we find there are people so base, so lost to all sense of moral rectitude, so vile and abandoned, as to wander about in the night time, like beasts of prey, seeking what they can find, and whom they may devour.— There are people, who, when the virtuous and good are asleep in their beds, devise mischief against them, and endeavour to find out ways to enter their houses and rob them. There are people, who, when perpe∣trating such acts of violence, would, if possible, mur∣der those who oppose, or venture to arrest them.</P>
<P>Instances of night-robbery and murder, in countries long settled and full of inhabitants, have not been un∣common. From those elder and more corrupt parts
<PB N="9" REF="032358_0007_0FF1F065D74E9168"/>of the earth, some of the basest of men have found the way to America.</P>
<P>It has been suspected, that the late devastations by fire, in several of the southern States, were occasioned by some wicked persons, who have come among us. Strong suspicions have been entertained, within a few weeks, that incendiaries and robbers have found the way to Boston; and within a few days past, we have had alarming evidence, that our suspicions were not without reason.</P>
<P>Several houses have been broken open in the night, and the inhabitants put in danger of their lives. One of those daring enemies of our peace, seized in the very act of robbery, and with a deadly weapon in his hand, is now under sentence of death, and in a few days must be removed from among the living.</P>
<P>But the solemnity of the trial, which brought to∣gether a vast crowd of people, was not sufficient to de∣ter other sinners, who were at the time lurking in our borders, from crimes equally atrocious.</P>
<P>On the very night after the trial, two other houses in the town were broken open; to one of which fire was kindled, and had the inhabitants remained igno∣rant of their danger a few minutes longer, they must have perished in the flames.</P>
<P>Imagination cannot describe the consternation we should have felt, had not the increasing flame been discovered just at the moment. From the combusti∣ble nature of the building to which the fire was kin∣died, and of the buildings in the neighbourhood,— from the <HI>force</HI> and the <HI>direction</HI> of the wind, on that night, it is not probable the fire could have been
<PB N="10" REF="032358_0008_0FF1F069ED9AC248"/>checked, in its dreadful progress, until it had laid in ruin a large portion of the town. We thank God for the wonderful preservation!</P>
<P>I should expose myself to the just resentment of my fellow citizens, did I attempt to excite their fears, and disturb their repose, without sufficient reason. But the repeated instances of house-breaking and robbery, and of attempting to set fire to the town, afford painful evidence, that some of the worst and most dangerous of mankind are now among us: The utmost vigilance and exertion of the inhabitants are called for on this occasion.</P>
<P>Having mentioned some of the dangers and evils to which large towns and cities are more particularly exposed, it will be natural to inquire, What is to be done?—will it be advisable to abandon the cities, and spread more thinly over the country?—or, can we think of any means of guarding against the dangers and evils to which populous places are particularly exposed?</P>
<P>Towns and cities grow up with commerce and man∣ufactures: They cannot be abandoned, therefore, with∣out doing violence to the natural course of things in society. There are evils in <HI>society,</HI> and there are evils in a <HI>state of nature:</HI> There are evils peculiar to large and crowded places; and there are advantages in some measure to balance them. Evils we shall find, more or less, in all situations and employments of life. Be∣fore we determine to shift our situation and employ∣ment, we shall do well to make use of all the means in our power, to secure ourselves against the evils which attend them; and then, after comparing all circumstances, we may determine, whether a change
<PB N="11" REF="032358_0009_0FF1F06DC3BD6D90"/>of situation and employment would, on the whole, give us a greater prospect of happiness. But after all we can do, let our situation be what it may, we are taught to place our hope in God, both for success in the business of life, and for protection in danger and trouble.</P>
<P><Q>Except the Lord keepeth the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.—</Q></P>
<P>These sacred words teach us to hope in God as our protector and refuge in trouble; and they teach us that we ourselves also must be active and vigilant. We must <HI>watch,</HI> as well as <HI>pray.</HI></P>
<P>In this place I would beg leave to mention a few particulars, to which we shall do well to give heed, as we wish to lessen the dangers and evils incident to large and populous places.</P>
<P>The limits of the present discourse will only admit of <HI>Hints,</HI> which I will venture to suggest under each of the particulars already mentioned; the propriety of which I submit to the judgment of my fellow cit∣izens.</P>
<P>1st. Large towns and cities are more exposed to the calamities of war, than smaller places. The inhabi∣tants, therefore, if they are wise, will endeavour to keep peace with all those powers which are able to injure them: They will be careful not to give occa∣sion, by threatening speeches, or by any unrighteous conduct, either to their neighbours, or foreign pow∣ers, to make war upon them.</P>
<P>But as the rulers of the nations are more generally governed by passion and self-interest, than by reason and equity, and people who were the most inoffensive
<PB N="12" REF="032358_0010_0FF1F06FA3919B28"/>have been invaded, the inhabitants of rich towns and cities will do well, even in profound peace, to provide for their defence: But in the present restless state of the world, when nations rise up against nations, and the fury of war creates innumerable wants, those who are not particularly connected with the contending powers need to be on their guard, and fortify against lawless invaders. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note 1st See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>2dly. Large towns and cities are more exposed to the calamities arising from sedition and rebellion, than less populous places. The wise and virtuous, therefore, will endeavour, by all prudent means, to counteract a factious spirit: They will unite, and come forward with alacrity and firmness, to support government and withstand the turbulence of unreasonable men.</P>
<P>3dly. Large towns and cities are more exposed to infectious and pestilential diseases, than less populous places. Wisdom and the healing art will at all times lend their aid to prevent the spread of fatal disorders, and guard the inhabitants of crowded places against the maladies to which they are particularly exposed. The removal of all putrescent matter—cleanliness, and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the first things necessary to the preservation of health in large towns and cities. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note 2d. See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>4thly. Large towns and cities are more exposed to devouring flames, than smaller places. The inhabi∣tants of large and crowded places are therefore re∣quired to be particularly watchful. Much may be done to guard against this calamity by brick walls, and the use of such materials for covering, as are not
<PB N="13" REF="032358_0011_0FF1F0717948EEA8"/>combustible: But after all that can be done, in the ways above mentioned, under Providence, safety de∣pends very much on the habitual attention and vigi∣lance of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>5thly. Large towns and cities are more exposed to incendiaries, and robbers, than smaller places.</P>
<P>To lessen the danger, from the enemies now men∣tioned, it will be necessary that the government of large towns and cities be sufficiently vigorous to ap∣prehend, and confine, all suspected persons.</P>
<P>As towns and cities increase in population and wealth, it is found necessary that the government be more vigorous, and that it proceed with more firmness and dispatch, than in the earlier stages of society. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note 3d. See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>But as I only mean to give a few hints, tending to our security against the dangers and evils incident to populous places, I would leave them with my fellow citizens, and go on, according to promise,</P>
<P>To suggest a few considerations, in order to impress on our mind the importance of trusting in God as our protector and refuge in danger and trouble.</P>
<P>Having done all in our power, we still need the protection of Omnipotence. The lesson contained in the text cannot be too frequently inculcated: The important idea cannot be too deeply engraven on our heart: <Q>Except the Lord keep the city, the watch∣man waketh but in vain.</Q> The enemies of our peace and safety may be working in secret places, where the most vigilant eye of man cannot see them. But while their designs are hidden from us, and we know nothing of them, all their wicked plans are known to
<PB N="14" REF="032358_0012_0FF1F0776D46E970"/>God. There is no secret corner—no dark retreat, where the thief and incendiary can hide from the eye of Him who knoweth all things.</P>
<P>He beholds the kindling sire, which, if blown up to a flame, might consume us and our dwellings together. His good providence hath saved us. To him we give thanks, that the meditated destruction was discovered, and that some who devised mischief against us have been detected and confined.</P>
<P>We derive unspeakable consolation from the assu∣rance we have, that a Being of infinite perfection governs the world, and that he is able to counteract and frustrate the designs of our most dangerous ene∣mies. To a God of infinite power and goodness we may look: on him we may place our hope in all times of danger and trouble.</P>
<P>When invaded by foes from abroad, God can frus∣trate their designs: He can turn their councils into foolishness: He can scatter them by storms; and in a variety of ways prevent their executing the thing, which they may have purposed against us. If God is, pleased to defend us, we are safe; and we may hope he will be our defence, if we are careful to do the things which please him.</P>
<P>When reslless and wicked men combine for seditious purposes, and say in their heart, Let us break the bands of society and cast away the cords of government, He who sitteth in the heavens can make them ashamed, and bring the mischief which they had purposed for others, on their own heads.</P>
<P>When contagious and mortal diseases break out, and begin to spread calamity and death through our
<PB N="15" REF="032358_0013_0FF1F07AF6CDC518"/>streets, He who commandeth the winds and they blow, and governeth the seasons according to his pleasure, can instantly change the state of the atmosphere, and remove the threatening evil. Fire and vapour, and all the elements, are under his control. And He who controls the winds;—He who maketh the flam∣ing fire minister to his purposes, controlleth also the <HI>passions</HI> of the children of men. <Q>He maketh the wrath of man to praise him; and the remainder of wrath he restraineth.</Q> The most vile of the crea∣tion, even the bloody-minded assassin, the incendiary and murderer, are under his authority: they cannot move, when he is pleased to exercise his power, to restrain them.</P>
<P>To men of religion, such considerations as those which have now been suggested, are highly pleasing. What can afford us more solid comfort, than to be assured, that all things in the heavens and on the earth, yea, all the events which have taken place, and which shall take place throughout the unmea∣surable <HI>universe,</HI> are under the control of insinite wisdom, and infinire goodness!</P>
<P>Let us rejoice that the Lord reigneth; and as the government which he execiseth over his rational creatures is just and equal, let us always submit to him. In humble obedience to his will, let us commit all our important concernments to his providence: And when the scenes of time and nature shall change no more, may we be admitted to those peaceful regions, where no threatening enemy shall ever come near us: where the sons of anarchy and licentiousness shall never disturb us: where disease and death shall never
<PB N="16" REF="032358_0014_0FF1F07CC13BEB00"/>invade us: where the flames shall never reach our mansions: where the incendiary and robber shall never interrupt our repose. In those peaceful regions may we unite with the general assembly of the wise and good, in adoring the perfections of God, and the wisdom of his government, forever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, CONTAINING An Account of several daring Attempts to set Fire to the Town of BOSTON, and rob the Inhabitants; together with HINTS tending to the Security of populous Towns and Cities against the Evils to which they are more particularly exposed.</HEAD>
<P>TO whatever cause or causes it may be owing,— whether to the unusual commotions among the Euro∣pean nations, and the West-India islands,—or to <HI>false</HI> notions of liberty and equality which have been re∣ceived by people void of understanding,—or to the efforts of certain modern apostles of infidelity to break down the restraints of religion, and remove from the mind of man all apprehension of an <HI>hereafter,</HI> certain it is, that the American States have of late been ex∣posed to threatening and unusual calamities, from law∣less and wicked men.</P>
<P><HI>Heretofore</HI> there have been but few instances of <HI>arson,</HI> or house-burning, attended with night-robbery, in this country: But of late, instances of perpetra∣ting, or of attempting to perpetrate those crimes, have become alarming.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032358_0017_0FF1F08C379A7388"/>
According to promise, and in compliance with the wishes of some of my fellow citizens, I will now give an account of several daring attempts to set fire to Boston, and rob the inhabitants. In a few notes, I will then enlarge on the <HI>Hints,</HI> in the preceding Dis∣course, tending to the security of populous towns and cities against the evils to which they are particularly exposed.</P>
<P>But before I relate the attempts which have been made to set fire to Boston, I would just observe, that suspicions have been strong, that the fires which spread desolation through the capital of Georgia and of South-Carolina, some months ago, were the effects of wicked design. Those suspicions, we are informed, have been confirmed, and some have been executed for the crime.</P>
<P>Whether the incendiaries who began at the South∣ward came on towards the North; or the same evil spirit has operated on wicked people, in different parts of the country, in succession, we cannot say.</P>
<P>There is sufficient evidence that many attempts have been made (and in a number of them with fatal suc∣cess) to set fire to buildings in New-Jersey, in New-York, in Connecticut, and in several towns in Massachusetts, within the last three or four months.</P>
<P>The first instance of robbing and attempting to burn which I shall mention in <HI>this town,</HI> was on the night of Feb. 22. In an advertisement in the Centinel, Mr. Marriott sets forth, that his house in Winter-street "was broken open, robbed and fired." The neigh∣bours
<PB N="21" REF="032358_0018_0FF1F08E28F7F210"/>testify, that Mr. Marriott and his wife being from home, they saw an unusual light in the chamber, and on entering the same, they found the fire had done considerable damage, and that the house in a few minutes would have been consumed, had they not given "the timely assistance."</P>
<P>On the same night, the shop of Mr. <HI>Holmes</HI> in Union-street was broke open; and to the surprise of the owner, when he entered it in the morning, he saw fire had been placed on one of the shelves, which spread several feet,—burned the wood work to a coal, and then went out.</P>
<P>On the night of the 7th of March, the house of Mr. <HI>Solomon Hewes</HI> was entered and robbed of a considera∣ble sum of money; and on the same night the house of Mrs. <HI>Lee</HI> was robbed of money, plate and other valuables.</P>
<P>On Sunday morning March 5th, the town was alarmed with the fire which broke out in the house occupied by Mr. <HI>William Turner.</HI> The fire had made such progress before it was discovered, that no exer∣tions were sufficient to stop its rage. In a few min∣utes the building in which it was first discovered, and the elegant stable of the late Governor Bowdoin, were in flames. Although there were at the time some suspicions of wicked design, no proof could be obtained, until a <HI>black man</HI> was apprchended for anoth∣er crime of the same sort, in whose possossion were sound several articles, the property of Mr. Turner, which were taken from his house, on the night in which it was burned.</P>
<P>The next instance I shall mention is that which took place ar the house of Capt. Enoch Rust, in Prince-street.
<PB N="22" REF="032358_0019_0FF1F09069E4CAE0"/>It appeared on the trial of the criminal that the house was violently entered between the hours of two and three in the morning. Four or five locks were bro∣ken in the lower part of the house, but as the robbers did not find all the money which they expected, one of them, with a deadly weapon in his hand, entered the lodg∣ing chamber of Capt. <HI>Rust,</HI> jun. and with the threat∣ening language of a murderer, demanded his money. The young gentleman, with great spirit, slew upon the robber, and fortunately indeed, laid him on the floor. He was soon confined, has since had his trial, and is now under sentence of death <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was executed on the sixth of April</NOTE></P>
<P>In the night of March 16th, the house of Mr. <HI>Sam∣uel Goldsbury</HI> was broken open and robbed of several pieces of plate. The wretch who was guilty of the crime, before he left the house, perpetrated another much more dreadful. He kindled a fire in a part, the most convenient to communicate with the lodging chambers; and had not the inhabitants been awoke by the smoke, the slames would soon have rendered their escape impossible.</P>
<P>A <HI>black man</HI> who had served in the family was sus∣pected, and search being made, plate and other articles were found with him which had been taken, both from Mr. Goldsbury, and from Mr. Turner. The unhappy creature, who, it appears, had been confined for some crime in Nova-Scotia, not many months be∣fore, is now fast bound in chains, and kept for the time of trial.</P>
<P>On the same night that the burglary and arson were committed in the house of Mr. Goldsbury, the house of Mr. <HI>Rallion,</HI> in State-street, was entered
<PB N="23" REF="032358_0020_0FF1F09B841C9CC0"/>by a thief, who was taken before he could make his escape, and is also committed. On the same night a Mr. Tufts was robbed of his money, by three men, as he was passing over Winter-Hill.</P>
<P>Fire has also been sat to a building in Middle-street, belonging to Mrs. <HI>Beals;</HI> which having burned suffi∣ciently to discover the wicked design, went out, with∣out farther injury.</P>
<P>In short, for several weeks, almost every news-paper has given an account of fresh instances of setting fire to buildings of one kind or another, either in our neighbourhood, or in some parts of the country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr.Williams's barns and corn house in Roxbury were burnt on the 2d of April.</NOTE></P>
<P>The instances now mentioned, are sufficient to show, that some of the worst of the creation are lurking among us, and that the utmost vigilance and exertion are necessary to guard against them, and if possible to detect and confine them.</P>
<P>IF any apology be necessary for laying before my fellow citizens the following Notes, in addition to the Hints already given, I have only to say, they are offered with a good design.</P>
<P>Note 1st. <Q>In the present restless state of the world, those who wish to live in peace, and are not par∣ticularly connected with the contending powers, need be on their guard, and fortify against lawless invaders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032358_0021_0FF1F09F03110CA8"/>
The political situation of the American States at the present day, is peculiarly difficult. It is certainly our wisdom to keep out of the quarrels of the European quarter of the world: But while those kingdoms are angry with each other, they may not be disposed to treat <HI>neutral countries</HI> with impartiality and justice.—As God hath kindly placed us three thousand miles from the present great theatre of quarrel, we are in no great danger of hostile armies: But should the war continue to rage, our sea-ports may possibly be insulted by armed cruisers.</P>
<P>It seems as necessary that our towns and cities, near the water, should be fortified against lawless invaders, as that our houses should be barred and bolted against thieves and robbers. It is as necessary that a lock should be fixed to your <HI>harbour,</HI> as to the <HI>chest</HI> which contains your money:—As proper that the <HI>key</HI> should be in the hand of the supreme authority, as that the key of the family treasures, be in the hand of the head of the family.</P>
<P>Note 2d. <Q>The removal of all putrescent matter,— <HI>cleanliness,</HI> and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the first things necessary to the preservation of health, in large towns and cities.</Q></P>
<P>It is now universally acknowledged, that some of the most distressing maladies, which spread desolation and death through large and populous places, are oc∣casioned by the noxious vapours which the inhabitants inhale.</P>
<P>The first thing therefore which requires the atten∣tion of people who live in large and crowded places,
<PB N="25" REF="032358_0022_0FF1F0A0C7DA1608"/>in order to preserve health, is to remove as much as possible, every kind of substance which tends to poison the air.</P>
<P>The atmosphere in which we live, is never entirely pure: it is a compound of <HI>healthful</HI> and noxious fluids. By the laborious experiments of Dr. <HI>Priestly,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ingen-Housz,</HI> the late celebrated <HI>Lavoisier</HI> and others, it hath been demonstrated, that the quantity of <HI>noxious gas</HI> in the atmosphere, is always much greater than the <HI>pure vital air.</HI> The proportion of <HI>noxious</HI> to the <HI>vital air,</HI> in a state of the atmosphere favourable to health, is found to be as 72 to 28. On the preservation of <HI>this proportion,</HI> or something near to it, we depend for strength, for health, for spirits, and life itself.</P>
<P>The discovery of this proportion of <HI>vital air,</HI> and of <HI>noxious gas,</HI> in the atmosphere which we breathe, to∣gether with the means of <HI>increasing,</HI> or <HI>diminishing</HI> the one or the other, as occasion may require, are cer∣tainly among the most important discoveries of mod∣ern times.</P>
<P>If I can assist my fellow-citizens in the applica∣tion of these discoveries, for the purposes of prevent∣ing any of the evils to which large and crowded places are particularly exposed, I shall feel happy.</P>
<P>It is well known that the vapour from stagnant water, particularly in hot weather, from dirty streets, dead carcasses, and all putrescent bodies, is unfit for respiration. Such vapours, rising about us, and mix∣ing with the air we breathe, destroy the healthful pro∣portion abovementioned: When the quantity of <HI>nox∣ious gas</HI> is great, and long continued, it will produce
<PB N="26" REF="032358_0023_0FF1F0A7DFBA5080"/>some of the most fatal disorders, under which the in∣habitants of large and crowded places are ever doom∣ed to suffer.</P>
<P>To prevent those evils, the first attention must be given to <HI>cleanliness.</HI> If individuals in large and crowd∣ed places, neglect, or refuse to remove filth from their houses and doors, especially in the summer season, the common safety certainly will justify the interposition of authority.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Mitcheli,</HI> of New-York, in his ingenious and very useful <Q>attempt to ascertain the true nature of contagion,</Q> has the following observation to the present purpose;— <Q>While puddles of putrid nasti∣ness, and piles of reeking dung are incessantly ex∣haling their poisonous steams, that <HI>magistracy</HI> con∣sults very imperfectly the public health, which ne∣glects the removal of such common nuisances.</Q></P>
<P>As the <HI>gaseous oxyd,</HI> or noxious vapour from stagnant water, and the filth which is too long suffered to re∣main in the streets and lanes of populous towns, is heavier than good air, it is disposed to settle in low places: and accordingly the lowest parts of Philadelphia and of New-York, were the places where the <HI>yellow fever</HI> raged with the greatest violence. In low and dirty parts of a populous town, those fevers which are occasioned by bad air, may be always expected to put on the worst appearances.</P>
<P>Having done all in our power to prevent the in∣crease of bad air, our next attention should be given to promote the increase of that which is good.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032358_0024_0FF1F0AD7B561428"/>
The most certain means for this purpose, and at the same time, the least expensive, is to adorn the places in which we live, with <HI>thristy trees.</HI></P>
<P>Trees, during the whole time they are covered with green leaves, are found to take up, as their food, the <HI>nitrogene gas,</HI>—the corrupted air which has served the purposes of combustion,—which has passed the lungs of animals, or has been exhaled from putrid bodies; and in the kindest manner, to return streams of <HI>good air,</HI> from the upper surfaces of their leaves, exposed to the light of the sun.</P>
<P>I beg leave to finish this note with a part of the speech delivered before the Royal Society of LONDON, by Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> at the giving a prize medal to Dr. <HI>Priestly,</HI> as an honourable testimony of the appro∣bation of that learned body, of the labours which he had bestowed on the doctrine of air.</P>
<P><Q>From these discoveries, says he, we are assured, that no vegetable grows in vain, but that from the oak of the forest, to the grass in the field, every in∣dividual plant is serviceable to mankind; if not al∣ways distinguished by some private virtue, yet mak∣ing a part of the whole, which cleanses and purifies our atmosphere. In this the fragrant rose, and deadly night-shade co-operate: nor is the herbage, nor the woods that flourish in the remote and un∣peopled regions, unprofitable to us, nor we to them; considering how constantly the winds convey to them <HI>our</HI> vitiated air for <HI>our</HI> relief, and for <HI>their</HI> nourishment. And, if ever these salutary gales rise to storms and hurricanes, let us still trace, and re∣vere
<PB N="28" REF="032358_0025_0FF1F0B14943FA90"/>the ways of a beneficent Being, who, not fortuitously, but with design, not in <HI>wrath,</HI> but in <HI>mercy,</HI> thus shakes the waters and the air together, to bury in the deep, those putrid and pestilential effluvia, which the vegetables upon the face of the earth, had been insufficient to consume.</Q></P>
<P>Note 3d. <Q>As towns and cities increase in popula∣tion and wealth, it is found necessary that the gov∣ernment be more vigorous, and that it it proceed with more firmness and dispatch, than in the earlier stages of society.</Q></P>
<P>The truth of this observation cannot be called in question. Populous towns and cities, will find, by ex∣perience, the necessity of changing or improving their <HI>police,</HI> as their circumstances alter: Those regulations which answer the purposes of small villages and coun∣try towns, will be found insufficient for large commer∣cial places, especially when they become the resort of foreigners, bringing with them the habits of different nations, of different modes of education, and of differ∣ent religions.</P>
<P>A great part of the inhabitants of Boston, I believe, are convinced that the government of the town wants energy, and that the <HI>police</HI> established by our venera∣ble fathers, may be improved to advantage.</P>
<P>Some new regulations are wanting, or additional force and spirit given to such as have been already made, to prevent the evils we suffer from <HI>vagrants,</HI> strolling <HI>mendicants,</HI> and people of suspicious, and of bad char∣acter.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032358_0026_0FF1F0B31747DE90"/>
A complete remedy of the evils now mentioned, can be expected in nothing short of the <HI>confinement</HI> of persons, of the above description, in some place of punishment or industry, where they shall be prevented doing mischief, and if possible, be obliged to earn their living.</P>
<P>The astonishing relief given to the city of <HI>Munich,</HI> by our countryman Sir <HI>Benjamin Thompson,</HI> now <HI>Count of Rumford,</HI> when it was infested with a multitude of impudent mendicants, and people of the most vicious character, is sufficient to show what may be done; and to encourage like attempts in other parts of the world.</P>
<P>A house of <HI>Industry</HI> was provided, with suitable ac∣commodations and employments; and under the di∣rection of that enterprising and benevolent officer, <HI>Munich</HI> was, in one day, delivered from 1200 misera∣ble creatures, sunk in vice, and pests of society.</P>
<P>Nor will the expense of such an enterprise, as that which was carried into execution by <HI>Benjamin, Count of Rumford,</HI> to put an end to the evils of <HI>mendicity</HI> in Bavaria, be at all discouraging, when it is considered, that he prepared a very wholesome kind of food for 1200 people in the house of industry, for £ 1.7.6. per day, which is but a little over <HI>one farthing</HI> for each person; and by a great improvement in the construc∣tion of the kitchen fire-place, the fuel necessary to cook food for 1000 people does not cost more than <HI>four pence half penny.</HI></P>
<P>What has been done by <HI>Count Rumford</HI> in Bavaria, may be done in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="032358_0027_0FF1F0B51F2E3938"/>
Conceive now of the relief we should experience from an institution similar to that which we have been considering!—Such institutions in our large towns and cities, would go far to prevent the evils which we suffer from <HI>idle</HI> and <HI>vicious</HI> persons, who are constant∣ly strolling about, and of late, have spread alarm both in town and country.</P>
<P>Such an institution, executed with spirit, and accom∣panied with a frequent <HI>return</HI> to an office of <HI>police,</HI> of the names of all persons who put up at lodging houses, and houses of entertainment of every description, to∣gether with the general state of the several wards into which the town now is, or may be conveniently divided, would do more towards our security against <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>incendiaries,</HI> than the <HI>nightly watch</HI> and <HI>patrol</HI> of a large number of the inhabitants.</P>
