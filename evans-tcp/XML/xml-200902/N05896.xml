<P>The Committee to consider and report on the Suits now brought against the Speaker of the last House of Representatives, the honourable THOMAS HUBBARD, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; their Messenger <HI>William Baker,</HI> and the Keeper of the Prison <HI>Alexander Young;</HI> by <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> and by <HI>Royall Tyler</HI> against the Messenger; find, that the House of Representatives of this Province on the 24th Day of <HI>October</HI> last; <HI>Voted,</HI> That a Pamphlet Intitled, <HI>The Monster of Monsters,</HI> then lately publish∣ed; is a false scandalous Libel, reflecting upon the Proceedings of said House in general, and on many worthy Members in particular, in Breach of the Pri∣viledges thereof; and <HI>Resolved,</HI> That the Messenger of the House do forthwith take into Custody <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> Printer, who they were informed
<PB N="3" REF="007481_0003_102B99988A31B9D8" MS="y"/>
was concerned in Printing and Publishing the said Pamphlet, and that the Speaker issue his Warrant for that Purpose; that the Speaker issued his Warrant accordingly; and that the said <HI>Fowle</HI> was thereupon on said Day apprehended and brought into the House by the Messenger, and examined, and recommitted by Order of said House; and that afterwards on said Day the said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> was brought into the House, and further examined touching the Premisses; and that during said Examination he behaved very con∣temptuously towards the House; for which, as well as on Suspicion of his printing and publishing said Pamphlet, it was ordered by said House, That the said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> be committed to the Common Goal in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and that the Speaker issue his Warrant accordingly; and that the said Speaker thereupon issued his Warrant directed to the Messen∣ger of said House, and to the Keeper of said Prison, for the Commitment of said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> to said Pri∣son, on Suspicion of his printing and publishing said Pamphlet; and thereupon on said Day the said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> was committed to the aforesaid Goal, by the said <HI>William Baker</HI> the Messenger, and there received and imprisoned by <HI>Alexander Young</HI> the Keeper; and on the 25th Day of said <HI>October</HI> the said House <HI>Re∣solved,</HI> That <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> has been concerned in pub∣lishing a scandalous Pamphlet, intitled <HI>The Monster of Monsters,</HI> in which the House are greatly reflected on, in Breach of their Priviledge; and that he con∣tinued in said Goal on said Commitment until the 29th Day of said <HI>October,</HI> when he was brought to the Bar of said House, and Reprimanded by said Speaker for publishing said scandalous Libel, and by
<PB N="4" REF="007481_0004_102B999A8C4459B0"/>

<P>And the Committee further find, That the said <HI>Royall Tyler</HI> was on the said 24th Day of <HI>October,</HI> by the Speaker's Warrant issued to the Messenger, ac∣cording to the Order of the House, taken by him into Custody, and brought before them for being con∣cerned in printing and publishing said Pamphlet, and thereupon remained in his Custody until the 26th Day of said <HI>October,</HI> when he was by Order of the House, discharged from said Custody.</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon the Committee humbly Report,</HI></P>
<P>That these Arrests and Commitments are the Mat∣ters of Complaint in said Actions; that the Right of Commitment by the House of Representatives of this Province for the Breach of their Priviledges, will pro∣bably come into Question in the Course of these Ac∣tions; that this Power of committing has often and for a long Time been exercised by many former Houses of Representatives; that the House of Representatives of this Province are the indisputable Judges of any Breach of their Priviledges, and have an Authority to arrest, commit and examine for such Breaches, not only their own Members, but others; That it was the indispensable Duty of the Speaker of said House to issue his Warrants according to the aforementioned Orders, and of the Messenger of said House, and Keeper of said Goal to execute them; and that these Suits are an Attempt against the Rights of the People of this Government, in the Authority of this House to commit for a Contempt to their Representative Body, and to frustrate all Effect of this Authority, and to introduce Disorder and Confusion; and that
<PB N="5" REF="007481_0005_102B999CB9E1B408"/>
therefore the honourable THOMAS HUBBARD, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; who issued these Warrants, <HI>William Baker</HI> the Mes∣senger, and <HI>Alexander Young</HI> the Keeper of the Pri∣son, who obeyed them, be defended in these Actions; and that a Committee of the House be appointed to attend and take Care of the Defence.</P>

<P>The Committee to prepare the Draught of a Mes∣sage to the honourable Board, Remonstrating against their altering Grants made by the House, reporting the following Message, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007481_0008_102B99A28FA1A9C8"/>
The House of Representatives in the Grant Yester∣day made to a Committee of the House, to defend the Priviledges of the Representative Body of this Province, sensible of the Attempt made against the Right of the People of this Government in the Au∣thority of their Representative Body, to commit for a Contempt to them, voted a Sum of Money for the Defence of this fundamental Priviledge, and sent this Vote to the honourable Board to be concurred or non-concurred, neither of which they did, but were pleased to send it back with Alterations. Whereupon the House declare it to be their clear Opinion, that the Grant of any Money by this Court to be raised by the People, must not only originate with the House, in Consequence of their representing the People, but that such Grant cannot, in Consequence of this their singular Right, be any Way subject to the Alteration of any other Branch of the Government; and that the Amendment made Yesterday by the Board in the said Grant, is a Violation of the Priviledge of the House, upon a Vote made for the Support of their Priviledges; which they are determined thoroughly to defend and maintain against all Attempts and En∣croachments whatsoever.</P>
<P>Read and accepted, and <HI>Voted,</HI> That the foregoing Message be sent to the honourable Board.</P>
<P>And <HI>Ordered,</HI> That Col. <HI>Quincy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tyng,</HI> Mr. <HI>Spar∣hawk,</HI> Mr. <HI>Vassall, Nath. Russell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; Col. <HI>Ruggles,</HI> Col. <HI>Clap,</HI> Capt. <HI>Livermore,</HI> and Col. <HI>Murray,</HI> be a Committee to carry up the same.</P>
<P><HI>John Chandler,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; brought down a Message from the honourable Board; which he read and laid on the Table, and then withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007481_0009_102B99A4C4BAF000"/>
The said Message is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Board have no Inclination to engage in a Con∣troversy with the honourable House on any Point whatsoever, at a Juncture when Affairs of such vast Importance are depending, and although the Board have been in the constant Practice of lessening Grants made by the honourable House, ever since the Char∣ter, yet they do not design to enter into any Dispute on this Point at this Time: Before the Message from the honourable House of this Day, the Board had absolutely non-concur'd the Vote of the honourable House, which had first been amended by the Board, but upon a Non Concurrence of the honourable House, was again sent up to the Board.</P>
<P>The Board are desirous of keeping up the Har∣mony that has subsisted between the several Branches of the Legislature, and are neither for extending their own Priviledges nor abridging the Priviledges of the honourable House, and are willing to come into any Expedient, that may preserve the Rights of each House.</P>
<P>The Board would have no Exception to a Vote, effectually securing the Payment out of the publick Treasury, of every reasonable Expence, that may at∣tend or be the Consequence of the Actions referred to: but they apprehend that many Inconveniences may arise from the granting any determinate large Sum for this Purpose, and that all the Ends proposed by the Vote of the honourable House may be fully answered without it.</P>
<P>The said Message was read again.</P>
<P>The Message from the honourable Board of this Day was read again; and after some Debate thereon,
<PB N="10" REF="007481_0010_102B99A682FEE438"/>
<HI>Ordered,</HI> That the same be committed to the Com∣mittee appointed to prepare a Message to the hon∣ourable Board, Remonstrating against their altering Grants of Money made by the House, to prepare the Draught of a proper Answer thereto.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day's proceedings">
<HEAD><HI>Lunae</HI> 23. <HI>Die Februarii,</HI> A. D. 1756.</HEAD>
<P>The Committee appointed to prepare the Draught of an Answer to the Message of the honourable Board of the 21st Instant, reported thereon. Which was read and accepted, and</P>
<P><HI>Voted,</HI> That the following Message be sent to the honourable Board, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It was not with any Disposition to Controversy, the House sent their Message on Saturday last to the honourable Board, but entirely from a Perswasion that it is no more in the Power of the honourable Board to lessen a Sum of Money granted by the House, than to make a Grant or augment the Sum; and al∣tho' the honourable Board have said they have been in the constant Practice of lessening Grants made by the House, ever since the Charter, the House consider this as a sudden Assertion, and impossible to be proved.</P>
<P>The House are very sensible of the Importance of the Affairs now depending in this Court, and are de∣sirous that the Harmony which has hitherto subsisted between the several Branches of the Legislature may continue; they are at the same Time sensible of the Attempt made abroad against a Priviledge, without which the House cannot subsist, and conceive it to be their Duty to take Care of their own Being, for the Sake of that Harmony which is necessary for the public Weal at this Juncture.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007481_0011_102B99A8CFC61218"/>
The House have considered the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies of the Grant of Money, which they made to their Committee on Thursday last, to in∣demnify the Speaker of the last House, against the Actions brought against him, and those who acted by Virtue of his Warrant, issued by Order of that House; and to secure this and all future Houses from any petulent, seditious Contempts, were then as well as are now clearly of Opinion, that their Power of committing for these Contempts, is of the greatest Importance to them; and that the Grant as made is most convenient, and best adapted to answer the Pur∣poses of it; and should be glad the honourable Board would enter again into the most extensive Considera∣tion of the Advantages and disadvantages of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That Major <HI>Hawley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Payne,</HI> and <HI>Nath. Russell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; be a Committee to carry up the foregoing Message to the honourable Board.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That Col. <HI>Cotton</HI> go up with a Message to the honourable Board to enquire, whether they have (in Consequence of the Message from the House) pass'd upon their Vote for granting a £. 1000 Ster∣ling to their Committee appointed to defend the Speaker and others, in the Actions brought against them.</P>
<P>Who returned that he had delivered the Message. <HI>Thomas Hutchinson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; came down with a Mes∣sage from the honourable Board to acquaint the House, that at their Desire they had reconsidered the said Vote for granting £. 1000 Sterling to the Com∣mittee of the honourable House; and after a full Deliberation, had again non-concur'd thereon.</P>
