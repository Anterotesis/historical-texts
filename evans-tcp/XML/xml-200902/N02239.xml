<HEAD>To my dear Brother, Mr. <HI>NEHEMIAH WALTER,</HI> Pastor of the first Church in <HI>Roxbury.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SYR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is mentioned among the Occurrences of a very sorrowful Time, <HI>A Man's Uncle shall take him up.</HI> It seems, upon a <HI>Young Man's Dying,</HI> 'tis look'd for, that his <HI>Uncle</HI> should perform the part of a <HI>Father</HI> to him. I am now to do it, on the behalf of a <HI>desirable Young Man,</HI> who was to me not unlike what a <HI>Sisters Son</HI> was to <HI>Paul;</HI> and whose <HI>Death</HI> makes a sorrowful Time for us: Herein also an <HI>Uncle</HI> attempts to abate the Sorrows of a <HI>Father.</HI> And tho' no <HI>Word</HI> in any other Language can ex∣press, what the Hebrew has in its <HI>CHESED,</HI> for our <HI>Duty to the Dead;</HI> yet the <HI>Thing</HI> I am now in my poor way endeavouring.</P>
<P>When the lovely Young <HI>Caesarius,</HI> the Son of the blessed Old <HI>Gregorius,</HI> died before his Father, <HI>Nazianzen</HI> in his Funeral Oration upon him, compared his <HI>Father</HI> unto an <HI>Aaron</HI> in the House of his GOD. I am sure, there is One thing in an <HI>Aaron,</HI> which is not unworthy of <HI>Your</HI> Imi∣tation on this Occasion; As he was a great <HI>Sa∣crificer,</HI> so when a sad Thing befel his Family,
<PB N="ii" REF="002666_0003_0FE5FB27085CEE20"/><HI>He held his peace.</HI> And if <HI>Nonna</HI> wisely bear her part also in the <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> upon the offering whereof with an holy <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> and Resignation, it will be said, <HI>Now I know that thou fearest GOD;</HI> what was <HI>Good</HI> will still be <HI>Better.</HI></P>
<P>Your Excellent Predecessor, the Venerable and Memorable ELIOT, burying a valuable <HI>Son,</HI> soon after the Young Man's entrance upon the Work of the Evangelical Work of the Mini∣stry, the brave old Man said upon it, <HI>My Desire was, that my Son should have served CHRIST on Earth; but if GOD will chuse to have him serve Him in Heaven, I have nothing to object against it; But His Will be done.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Son,</HI> in whom You have had the uncom∣mon Satisfaction of having him joined with you, in the <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> of the Church, where∣in you <HI>had proof of him, that as a Son with a Father, he served with you in the Gospel,</HI> must now go from <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>serve CHRIST in Heaven</HI> before You. But as Piety teaches you to be satisfied in this <HI>Translation,</HI> so you are aware that he goes but a very <HI>Little before</HI> you: 'Tis much beyond you Expectation, that it is <HI>at all before you.</HI></P>
<P>His rare Accomplishments, his acute <HI>Penetra∣tion,</HI> his copious <HI>Erudition,</HI> with his right <HI>Prin∣ciples,</HI> render his <HI>Death</HI> an unknown Loss to our <HI>Churches,</HI> as well as to his <HI>Parents.</HI> His obliging <HI>Disposition,</HI> and ingenious <HI>Conversation,</HI> rendred him, the <HI>Delicium Humani Generis; Beloved</HI> unto
<PB N="iii" REF="002666_0004_0FE5FB3ED3F86188"/>the Degree, that <HI>Seneca</HI> affirms of his charming Brother <HI>Gallio:</HI> But singularly so unto his <HI>Pa∣rents.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> was he of whom you said, <HI>This same shall Comfort us.</HI> But our Glorious Lord, by wi∣thering such <HI>Comforts,</HI> effectually leads you to the <HI>Only Comforter that can relieve your Soul.</HI> May He be <HI>Nigh</HI> unto you; And unto a <HI>Mo∣ther,</HI> who has a <HI>Sword piercing thro' her Soul also,</HI> and calls herself <HI>Marah</HI> in the <HI>bitter Bereavement— Complexa sui Corpus miserabile Nati.</HI> And may He spare you still some Years to a dear Flock; whose importunate <HI>Prayers</HI> have remarkably kept you out of your Grave; and whose ex∣emplary <HI>Bounties</HI> have prepared them for such a Mercy as the further Continuance of you to be a Blessing unto them.</P>

<HEAD>THE Most Honourable Service.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Joh. XII. 26.</BIBL>
<P><HI>If any Man serve me, him will my Father honour.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Design at this Time is, to <HI>press</HI> as many as will be perswaded, into the <HI>Service</HI> of a <HI>great King, whose Name is Venerable.</HI> And that we may all now become the <HI>willing People</HI> of a Lord, who will accept of none but <HI>such,</HI> Behold, what that <HI>Service</HI> will bring us to. I show unto you the <HI>Encouragement,</HI> which the <HI>King of Glory</HI> gives un∣to all His faithful <HI>Servants.</HI> You are now in∣formed and assured from the Glorious Lord, That you shall be <HI>with Him;</HI> which is to say, That you shall be in a state of <HI>Blessedness:</HI> Yea, and in that state, there will be astonishing <HI>Ho∣nours,</HI> which the <HI>FATHER</HI> of our SAVIOUR shall concur with Him, in bestowing upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002666_0005_0FE5FA3EEB3FE258"/>
Our SAVIOUR was told by some of His Disciples, That there were some <HI>Gentiles</HI> desirous of a private Admission unto Him. Upon this Occasion our SAVIOUR foresees the speedy Approach of the Hour, when he should be <HI>glo∣rified among the Gentiles;</HI> and see a <HI>surrogate Israel.</HI> But at the same Time, He declares the unex∣pected way, in which He must arrive to this <HI>Glorification;</HI> the strange and black <HI>Preliminary</HI> that must lead unto it. It must be, by <HI>Death;</HI> even by <HI>Death;</HI> As a Grain of <HI>Corn</HI> must lie for <HI>Dead</HI> in the Earth, before it fructifies. Our SAVIOUR having foretold what was to be <HI>His</HI> own Condition, He foretels, what must also be the Condition of <HI>them</HI> that will <HI>serve</HI> Him; He forewarns them to expect a Conformity to Him, in <HI>Sufferings,</HI> preparatory to the Bessedness wherein He will have them to be associated with Him. <HI>Hard Lines! Dark Strokes!</HI> No Man <HI>serve</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or hope to be <HI>with Him,</HI> unless he be willing to <HI>Die</HI> like Him, to <HI>Die</HI> for Him! <HI>Flesh and Blood; What wilt thou say to This!</HI>—To fortify His Followers, our SAVIOUR now tells them, what will be the Consequence, and what will be done for them. This particularly, That His <HI>Father</HI> will put wonderful <HI>Honours</HI> upon them. And this is the DOCTRINE which is now to animate us in the ways of our GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Wonderful, wonderful, will be the Honours, which the True Servants of our SAVIOUR, will find His Eternal FATHER to bestow upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002666_0005_0FE5FA3EEB3FE258"/>
The Glorious <HI>FATHER</HI> of our Great <HI>Savi∣our,</HI> will <HI>honour</HI> them, who faithfully <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>Son of His Love.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. You shall have set before you, in the first place, the <HI>Character</HI> of those who stand <HI>Candidates</HI> for <HI>Happiness.</HI> They are the True SERVANTS of our SAVIOUR. They must <HI>serve me,</HI> saith our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But let us enquire, <HI>Who are the True Servants of our SAVIOUR?</HI> And let us attempt a De∣scription of them: For, <HI>Happy are thy Men, Hap∣py are thy Servants, that stand continually before thee,</HI> O our SAVIOUR. It may in general be said, All the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are to be known by that Motto, Phil. I. 21. <HI>To me to live is CHRIST.</HI> CHRIST is He whom they <HI>live</HI> unto. CHRIST is He whom they <HI>live</HI> upon. A CHRIST is the <HI>Fountain of Life</HI> unto them all.</P>
<P>But we must' be more particular.</P>
<P>Now, First; You may be sure, The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR must be such as <HI>Believe</HI> on Him. 'Tis the Term for a <HI>Believer,</HI> 1 Cor. VII. 22. <HI>He is the Servant of CHRIST.</HI> A <HI>Faith</HI> in our SAVIOUR is a Necessary Introduction unto the <HI>serving</HI> of Him. No Man can become a <HI>Ser∣vant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, without <HI>believing</HI> Him to be, what His Gospel has revealed Him to be, and without <HI>believing</HI> on him for all the Good which His Gospel has promised unto His Peo∣ple.
<PB N="4" REF="002666_0006_0FE5F9FB12943DA8"/>Every <HI>Servant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, is in∣expressibly affected with the Glory of His <HI>Person,</HI> and with the Truth of His <HI>exceeding great and precious Promises;</HI> and accordingly closes with Him. The very first Thing in becoming a <HI>Ser∣vant</HI> of our SAVIOUR is, to see and say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Thou art no less than the CHRIST, the Son of the Living GOD; and all the Blessings of Wisdom and Righteousness and Sanctifying and Re∣demption are to be expected from thee alone; And for all these I come unto thee, as unto my only SA∣VIOUR: With a perishing and a distressed Soul, I come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>We will go on to say, Secondly; The <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are such as attend upon Him, for all that must bring them to <HI>live unto God.</HI> Our SAVIOUR has no <HI>Servants,</HI> but those <HI>Regenerate</HI> ones, who have a <HI>new Biass</HI> upon their Minds, disposing them to <HI>live</HI> not unto <HI>Themselves</HI> but unto GOD; and find that in GOD, which they have heretofore, sought in <HI>Idols.</HI> Now the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, have their Eyes unto <HI>Him,</HI> that <HI>He</HI> may do all that is needful for their <HI>living</HI> unto GOD. Their Address to Him is that; Psal. CXXIII. 2. <HI>Be∣hold, As the Eyes of Servants look to the Hand of their Masters, so our Eyes are upon the Lord our God, until that He have mercy on us.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD it is required, that we be <HI>Recon∣ciled</HI> unto Him, and that the Sentence of <HI>Death,</HI> which His violated Law has passed upon us,
<PB N="5" REF="002666_0006_0FE5F9FB12943DA8"/>may be taken off. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR look to Him for this; and thus hope in Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Let thy SACRIFICE be the Expiation of my Sin, and my Reconciliation to GOD, whom I have offended by my Sin.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD, it is requisite, that we be <HI>directed</HI> from above. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR look to Him for this <HI>Direction,</HI> and so call on Him, <HI>O Lord, shew me thy Ways, teach me thy Paths.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD, it is requisite, that we be <HI>assisted</HI> from above. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR look to Him for this <HI>Assistance;</HI> and so <HI>lean</HI> on Him, <HI>I can do all things thro' CHRIST who strengthens me.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are such as make it their Study to yield an universal and perpetual <HI>Obedience</HI> unto Him. Our SAVI∣OUR demands it of all that would <HI>serve</HI> Him; Matth. XI. 29. <HI>Take my Yoke upon you.</HI> The <HI>Golden Yoke</HI> which our SAVIOUR will have all that <HI>serve</HI> Him, to take upon them, is that <HI>Mo∣ral Law,</HI> the Sum whereof is, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart,</HI> and, <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</HI> Our SAVIOUR having delivered us from the <HI>Curse,</HI> to which the <HI>Law</HI> condemns us for our Breaches of it, now requires us to make this <HI>Law</HI> the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Life,</HI> and endeavour the most exact <HI>Obedience</HI> to it, and Condemn, and Humble and Abase our selves, when we fall short of Exactness in our <HI>Obedience.</HI> This endeavour after the most
<PB N="6" REF="002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708"/>consummate <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> is to be our Expression of our <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to our SAVIOUR, for His Redeeming us from the <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and Rescuing us into a <HI>better Covenant.</HI> The <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> are now the <HI>Command∣ments</HI> of our SAVIOUR; and by becoming His, we <HI>Establish the Law.</HI> Accordingly, if we would approve our selves the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, we must sincerely intend and pur∣sue, a full <HI>Obedience</HI> to all of <HI>His Commandments.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, labour to <HI>know</HI> the <HI>Duty,</HI> which He demands from them; and they say, <HI>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> They labour to <HI>do</HI> all that they <HI>know</HI> to be their <HI>Duty;</HI> and they say, <HI>Lord, I count all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way.</HI> They lament it as their Misery, when∣ever they Sin against the <HI>Law of CHRIST.</HI> They can say, <HI>His Commandments are not grievous.</HI> But it is their <HI>Grief,</HI> that His <HI>Commandments</HI> are no better obeyed with them. In the whole <HI>Course</HI> of their <HI>Life,</HI> they aim at <HI>Obedience</HI> unto their SA∣VIOUR. Yea, in all the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Life,</HI> this is their Aim. Even the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Tem∣poral</HI> Calling, the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Secular</HI> Business, is done upon this Intention; <HI>'Tis the Work which my SAVIOUR has assigned unto me!</HI> Their SAVI∣OUR is <HI>obey'd,</HI> in the most <HI>common Actions,</HI> which their <HI>Hand finds to do. Obedience</HI> to Him, is the <HI>Life of their Hand,</HI> in the doing of them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708"/>
Fourthly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are such as chuse it, and make it, their <HI>Main Concern,</HI> to bear <HI>Testimonies</HI> unto His <HI>Truths,</HI> &amp; His <HI>Ways,</HI> and therein to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him. We have the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, so spoken of, and spoken to; Isa. XLIII. 10. <HI>Ye are my Wit∣nesses, saith the Lord, and my Servants whom I have chosen.</HI> The Thing whereto these <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Lord are called, is that which is called, <HI>A confessing of our SAVIOUR,</HI> and, <HI>A shewing forth of His Praises.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, have their Souls enamoured on this Employment, this rare Employment, this high Employment; and they most heartily say upon it, <HI>This is all my Salvation, and all my Desire.</HI> They would in all possible Methods <HI>Testify,</HI> That their SAVI∣OUR is the <HI>Lord of Glory;</HI> That His <HI>Truths</HI> are <HI>Faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation;</HI> That His <HI>Ways</HI> are <HI>pleasant</HI> ones, and <HI>all His Paths are Peace.</HI> Yea, they would fill their <HI>Lives</HI> with such <HI>Testimonies.</HI> And they would make it the <HI>chief End</HI> of their <HI>Life</HI> to bear such <HI>Testimo∣nies.</HI> The Breathings of their very Souls with∣in them, are, <HI>O that I may cause the Name of my dear SAVIOUR, to be honourably thought of!</HI> To this End, their Souls do exceedingly breath after this; <HI>O that I may evermore set my Seal, unto all the Truths which my SAVIOUR has betrusted and enriched His Church withal.</HI> Their Souls do ve∣hemently breathe after this; <HI>O that I may ever∣more give and show my Approbation of the Ways which
<PB N="8" REF="002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158"/>my SAVIOUR has prescribed as Holy and Just and Good.</HI> They would <HI>Live,</HI> yea, they would also <HI>Die</HI> for the bearing of such <HI>Testimonies</HI> to the Cause of our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are such as make a free, a full, an everlasting <HI>Resig∣nation</HI> of themselves and their All, unto Him. Concerning the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, there has been this Account given; 2 Cor. VIII. 5. <HI>They have given themselves unto the Lord.</HI> Ask them, <HI>Whose are you?</HI> Every one of them will reply with all the Alacrity imaginable, <HI>I am the Lord's!</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, do in the most <HI>Voluntary</HI> manner, consent and resolve to be His, and make a <HI>Dedication</HI> of themselves unto Him, for all that <HI>Service,</HI> which it may please Him to use them in. Coming in∣to the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, they then sign <HI>Inden∣tures</HI> for the <HI>Service</HI> of their SAVIOUR. Upon this, they become desirous, to be entirely the Lord's, and have their <HI>All</HI> used in what <HI>Service</HI> He will have it put unto; and they comply with that Call; <HI>Ye are bought with a Price; there∣fore Glorify GOD in your Bodie, and in your Spirit, which belong to GOD.</HI> Yea, not only for the Application of their <HI>Bodies,</HI> and of their <HI>Spirits,</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of their SAVIOUR, but in apply∣ing their <HI>Possessions</HI> also unto it, they become, <HI>A People of Free-will offerings.</HI> As their Voice is, <HI>CHRIST is my All,</HI> so their Voice is, <HI>CHRIST shall have my All.</HI> But will they ever grow wea∣ry
<PB N="9" REF="002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158"/>of the <HI>Service?</HI> No; They all say, <HI>I love my Master, and I will not go out from him;</HI> so they have their <HI>Ears bored</HI> for a <HI>Service,</HI> which is all <HI>Delight</HI> unto them; All, a <HI>Delight in GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly. the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR are such as appear in His <HI>Cause,</HI> and for the Defence of His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in the World. It was of old cried out; Exod. XXXII. 26. <HI>Who is on the Lords side?</HI> And it is a Distinction to be made, in every Generation. Upon this, the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, <HI>gather themselves</HI> unto Him; and <HI>say unto their Father, and unto their Mother, I have not seen them; neither do they acknowledge their Brethren, nor know their own Children.</HI> The <HI>Cause</HI> of PIETY, is the <HI>Cause</HI> of our SAVIOUR; so far as PIETY prevails, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our SAVIOUR advances, &amp; flourishes. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will still appear in the De∣fence of PIETY Our SAVIOUR has His <HI>Ene∣mies</HI> in the World. The <HI>Enemies</HI> of PIETY are the <HI>Enemies</HI> of our SAVIOUR. They make Hostile Invasions on His <HI>Kingdom;</HI> which lies in <HI>Righteousness.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will still appear against these <HI>Enemies.</HI> They are <HI>Souldiers</HI> for Him; Listed under His <HI>Banners;</HI> having His <HI>Marh</HI> on their Foreheads. They will openly assert His Interest, and oppose the Adversaries thereof, and venture ther All in do∣ing so: <HI>Not love their Lives unto the Death.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR are such as have <HI>no Will</HI> of their own; such as
<PB N="10" REF="002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70"/>are entirely governed by the <HI>Will</HI> of their SA∣VIOUR; entirely at His Dispose. This is what <HI>Servants</HI> must come to! This is the Language always heard from the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; Act. XXI. 14. <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are willing to Do, all those things, whereof it may be said, <HI>This is the Will of God in CHRIST Jesus concerning you.</HI> The Things may be <HI>Hard Sayings,</HI> and their <HI>carnal Mind</HI> rise up in Rebellion a∣gainst the Things, and they feel a rebellious <HI>Will</HI> stirring in themselves; yet they conform to the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, and mortify and extinguish their own. Yea, If it be the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, that they should <HI>suffer</HI> uncom∣fortable Things, here they yield a profound Submission to His <HI>Will.</HI> They have learn'd <HI>in whatever state they are, to be content,</HI> with the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR; <HI>content</HI> with what <HI>state</HI> the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR shall order for them. They <HI>Sacrifice</HI> All to the Will of their SAVI∣OUR; All their Enjoyments are bound unto the <HI>Horns of the Altar,</HI> standing ready to be <HI>sacri∣ficed.</HI> They still say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Not my Will, but thy Will be done!</HI> And this compliance with the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, is very par∣ticularly conspicuous, in their submitting to <HI>Death,</HI> in the <HI>Time</HI> and in the <HI>Way,</HI> which our SAVIOUR shall appoint, when He will have no further <HI>Service</HI> from them. When the <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR have that Order from
<PB N="11" REF="002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70"/>Him, <HI>Go up, and die!</HI>— 'tis without much Re∣luctancy complied withal: They say, <HI>O Thou Lord of my Life, if I have no more to do for thee, I am willing to die, and with a Love strong as Death, go thro' the dark valley of the shadow of Death, to come unto thee!</HI> These, these are the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Oh! That you would Examine your selves; <HI>Am I one of these? How far do I answer this Cha∣racter?</HI> This I will say; <HI>Behold,</HI> Are ye the <HI>Ser∣vants of the Lord,</HI> O you who this Day <HI>stand in the House of the Lord?</HI> Then, <HI>Bless the Lord.</HI> For, <HI>The Lord who made Heaven and Earth</HI> will <HI>bless you out of Zion,</HI> and bring you into <HI>Zion,</HI> and no∣thing in <HI>Heaven</HI> or <HI>Earth</HI> proper for you, shall be denied unto you.</P>
<P N="2">II. But this is what is in the second place to be set before you; even the <HI>Happiness</HI> of those who come up to this <HI>Character.</HI> Wonderful, wonderful the <HI>Honours,</HI> which the true <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR shall receive of His Eternal FATHER. <HI>My Father will honour them,</HI> saith our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But let us Enquire, <HI>What are the HONOURS, which GOD will bestow upon the Servants of our SAVIOUR?</HI></P>
<P>Now, We might supersede all further An∣swer, with such a general one as that; 1 Cor. II. 9. <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath entred into the Heart of Man, the things which GOD
<PB N="12" REF="002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0"/>hath prepared for them that love Him.</HI> The <HI>Honours</HI> prepared for them that <HI>serve</HI> our SAVIOUR; O unutterable <HI>Honours!</HI> O inconceivable <HI>Honours!</HI> O Things <HI>far beyond all that we can ask or think!</HI></P>
<P>We will make one prefatory Remark on the <HI>Honours,</HI> which GOD will bestow upon the <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; They will be such <HI>Honours,</HI> and so bestow'd, that the Glorious GOD Himself shall be <HI>honoured</HI> in them. There is a Difference between those two; Joh. XII. 43. <HI>The praise of Men,</HI> and, <HI>The praise of GOD.</HI> The most of Men, if they <HI>honour</HI> us, and admire us, and applaud us, they terminate in the <HI>Creature;</HI> they look no further than <HI>us;</HI> GOD has not His Praises on the Occasion; GOD, without whom, and before whom, we are <HI>Nothing,</HI> is not <HI>Remembred.</HI> All comes to <HI>Nothing,</HI> in <HI>Remem∣brances</HI> of none but <HI>Ashes!</HI> A <HI>sacrilegious Idolatry</HI> is committed. A true <HI>Servant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, even deprecates it as an <HI>Infelicity,</HI> to be made the Object in this <HI>Idolatry.</HI> He had rather be left <HI>un∣considered,</HI> in the World. Yea, when he meets with <HI>Indignities</HI> from an ungodly Generation, it sweetens them unto him, to think, <HI>I am deliver∣ed from the Danger of being made an Idol among the Robbers of GOD.</HI> Yea, Oh! why should we not press after the high Flight of <HI>Nierembergius,</HI> who writes at this rate; <HI>Lord, I had rather, could it be without Sin, that all should</HI> hate me, <HI>than that they should</HI> love me for my self. <HI>If all the World hate
<PB N="13" REF="002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0"/>me, I should have but what is Mine. If they should love me for my self, they would usurp what is Thine.</HI> This I will say, A true <HI>Servant</HI> of CHRIST will be lothe to receive any <HI>Honours,</HI> of which he cannot see, that GOD and His CHRIST is <HI>honoured</HI> in them. Such Dispositions may be de∣rided as fanciful &amp; whimsical <HI>Extasies,</HI> But, <HI>O my Soul,</HI> do thou press after them, and rest not until thou arrive to more Perfection in them!</P>
<P>But, the <HI>Honours</HI> to be bestow'd on the <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are such as <HI>come</HI> from GOD. Surely then, they will also <HI>lead</HI> to GOD. GOD will have His <HI>Honours</HI> wondrously secured, expressed, observed in them. In short therefore; The <HI>Honours</HI> will be <HI>Blessings</HI> wherein the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will be manifested. The Glorious GOD says unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, as in Rev. III. 9. <HI>I will make them to know, that I have loved thee.</HI> The <HI>Honours</HI> to be bestow'd on them, will be in the <HI>Tokens</HI> of His <HI>Love,</HI> which a Gracious GOD will comfort them, and enrich them, and adorn them withal.</P>
<P>But let the <HI>matter extend</HI> into a little more of Particularity. We shall be told, <HI>what shall be done to the Man,</HI> whom the FATHER of our SAVIOUR <HI>delights to Honour.</HI></P>
<P>First; O ye <HI>Servants</HI> of an incomparable SA∣VIOUR; I am sure, you count it the greatest of <HI>Honours,</HI> to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of such a SAVI∣OUR. No <HI>Dignity,</HI> No <HI>Preferment,</HI> on Earth, to
<PB N="14" REF="002666_0011_0FE5FB46AFDAAFC8"/>be compared unto this! Will the Glorious GOD accept you to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>King</HI> whom He hath placed on His Throne; and employ you in the <HI>Service</HI> of Him, that is the <HI>King of Kings</HI> and the <HI>Lord of all?</HI> I am sure, you will say, <HI>This is Honour enough! My Ambition cannot soar higher than such an Honour as this!</HI> How can you judge otherwise, when you call to mind, who are your <HI>Fellow-servants?</HI> I will not mention such <HI>Worms of the Dust,</HI> as the Roman Emperours, who have subscribed themselves, <HI>The Vassals of the Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST.</HI> They shall vanish before the <HI>Prin∣ces</HI> whom I am going to speak of. The Bright <HI>Angels</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> all count it their <HI>Honour,</HI> to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of our JESUS on the Throne of GOD, and with Triumphs in it, be∣come your <HI>Fellow-servants.</HI> The least of those <HI>Mighty Ones,</HI> is greater than the greatest <HI>Mo∣narchs</HI> on our little Globe; And of these <HI>Mighty Ones</HI> how many <HI>Myriads</HI> are there, to whom you make those Acclamations in your <HI>serving</HI> of your SAVIOUR! Psal. CIII. 20, 21. <HI>O ye His Angels, vast in strength, Bless ye th' ETERNAL God; who do His Word, that so the Voice of His Word may be heard. O Bless ye the ETERNAL God, All ye His Marshall'd Hosts; Ye Ministers who Ex∣ecute His Will made known to you!</HI> Oh! How <HI>ho∣noured</HI> the Men, who have <HI>Angels</HI> for their Com∣panions! Ye <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, Ye are <HI>come,</HI> Oh! how welcom!— to the <HI>Myriads of Angels,</HI> that fly about the <HI>City of God!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002666_0011_0FE5FB46AFDAAFC8"/>
Pertinently upon this, will come in a second Satisfaction; While you are the <HI>Servants</HI> of your SAVIOUR, the <HI>Angels</HI> of your SAVIOUR will be your <HI>Guardians.</HI> You no sooner come into the <HI>Service</HI> of your SAVIOUR, but, <HI>Lo, The Morning Stars do sing together, and the Sons of God shout for Joy.</HI> They are glad of your coming be be so associated with them; and they gladly come into a <HI>Ministry</HI> for you. To all the <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, there belongs that Priviledge; Psal. XCI. 11. <HI>He shall give His An∣gels charge over thee.</HI> O Transcendent <HI>Honour!</HI> The meanest among the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR, has this <HI>Honour;</HI> An <HI>Angel</HI> of GOD at∣tends him, and befriends him; does unknown good Offices for him. <HI>This Honour have all the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>If this ben't enough, take a Third Satisfacti∣on. The FATHER of our SAVIOUR bestows this <HI>Honour</HI> on them that <HI>serve</HI> Him; He will be their <HI>Father</HI> too. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR, are all of them, the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD. <HI>Ye are my Sons and my Daughters, faith the Lord Almighty!</HI> And now, <HI>seemeth it a light thing unto you,</HI> to be the <HI>Children</HI> of that Infinite GOD who is the <HI>most high Possessor of Heaven and Earth! Children,</HI> who shall be <HI>Heirs</HI> of an Infinite GOD, and therefore shall <HI>inherit all things!</HI> O ye <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, Fall into that agreeable Rapture; 1 Joh. III. 1. <HI>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should
<PB N="16" REF="002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0"/>be called the Children of God!</HI> Will GOD the FA∣THER put <HI>Honour</HI> upon them that <HI>serve</HI> our SAVIOUR? GOD the SPIRIT will do so too; and this <HI>Honour</HI> does also proceed from the FATHER.</P>
<P>Behold, a Fourth Satisfaction! The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are all of them, the <HI>Temples</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT. Unto such it is said, 1 Cor. III. 16. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of GOD, and the Spirit of GOD dwelleth in you?</HI> Oh! What an <HI>Honour</HI> have you now a prospect of! This <HI>Honour, Know ye not,</HI> that that if you are the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, you are the <HI>Tem∣ples</HI> of GOD? His Holy SPIRIT will say, <HI>Here will I dwell, for I have desired it!</HI> The Holy SPI∣RIT will make you the <HI>Excellent in the Earth;</HI> more <HI>Excellent</HI> than the most Illustrious Temples of a <HI>Solomon</HI> or a <HI>Justinian;</HI> The <HI>Houses of His Glory,</HI> and glorified in being <HI>filled</HI> with His <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The Articles of <HI>Honour</HI> will keep growing on our Hands. Let this go for a Fifth of them. A precious <HI>Esteem</HI> with the <HI>Best of Men,</HI> is an <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> which they that <HI>serve</HI> the Best of Lords, are no strangers to. A <HI>Good Name</HI> does belong to them; A <HI>Good Name,</HI> which is <HI>better than precious Ointment;</HI> A <HI>Good Name,</HI> which is <HI>rather to be chosen than great Riches.</HI> He was not in the wrong, who gave this Definition of <HI>Honour; 'Tis a good Esteem with good Men for good Things.</HI> The <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, take the right Path to this <HI>Honour;</HI> and it may be said of them, as
<PB N="17" REF="002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0"/>in Heb. XI. 2. <HI>They obtain a good Report.</HI> It was by <HI>David</HI> thought an <HI>Honour; Let those that fear thee, turn to me.</HI> It was by <HI>Paul</HI> thought an <HI>Ho∣nour; That my Service may be accepted of the Saints.</HI> This <HI>Honour</HI> is granted unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; They are, as we read <HI>Mordecai</HI> was, <HI>Accepted of the Multitude of their Brethren.</HI> And, if they are Persons of greater Eminency for their <HI>Diligence,</HI> their <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> their <HI>Useful∣ness,</HI> the more Eminent often does GOD make them in their Esteem among His People. If thro' the Displeasure of GOD against a People that must be denied the Benefit of their Talents; or if thro' <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Faction</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI> prevailing in those who should be wiser, they may at any time <HI>want Acceptance;</HI> This will be no Real Di∣minution of their true <HI>Honour,</HI> or a just Esteem among those who are most capable to put <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> upon <HI>Goodness.</HI> And therewithal, they have the <HI>Honour</HI> of having may <HI>Prayers</HI> made for them, among the People of GOD. Yea, They may come to have a <HI>Great Name,</HI> as well as a <HI>Good Name:</HI> It may be, A <HI>Name among the Great Men of the Earth,</HI> is granted unto them. And as they <HI>Live Desired,</HI> so they <HI>Die Lamented.</HI> We read of one, <HI>All did him Honour at his Death.</HI> We read of another; <HI>They buried him honourably, because he had done good in Israel.</HI> We read of a Third, <HI>They Lamented him,</HI> and continued long <HI>to speak of him in their Lamentations.</HI> The <HI>Memory</HI> of these <HI>Just Ones,</HI> GOD makes it better than what has been
<PB N="18" REF="002666_0013_0FE5FB49DF5ACB60"/>often called by flattering Survivers, <HI>A blessed Memory.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Honoured</HI> are the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR, among the true <HI>Citizens of Zion,</HI> who <HI>Honour them that fear the Lord.</HI> But what if a∣mong <HI>Vile Persons</HI> they are <HI>Contemned?</HI> Even this also shall go among the Articles of their <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P>I will say, Sixthly; The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SA∣VIOUR, often have the <HI>Honour</HI> to be <HI>vilified</HI> by the <HI>vilest of Men;</HI> and by those who <HI>exalt</HI> none so much as the <HI>vilest of Men.</HI> Enquire of your <HI>Athanasius</HI>'s and your <HI>Luthers</HI> and your <HI>Cal∣vins,</HI> and all great Reformers, if it be not so. There is a sort of People, whose <HI>Ill Will,</HI> and <HI>Ill Word,</HI> is an <HI>Honour</HI> to those whom it falls up∣on; 'Tis a <HI>Disgrace</HI> unto a Man, and it brings a Suspicion upon his Innocency [<HI>Quid mali feci?</HI>] to be in the <HI>good Graces</HI> of such <HI>evil Men.</HI> We read concerning some <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR; Act. V. 41. <HI>They rejoiced, that they were counted worthy of the Honour, to suffer Shame for His Name.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, shall have the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Reproaches,</HI> and <HI>Calumnies,</HI> and <HI>Obloquies,</HI> from those wretched People, who have that Brand upon them, <HI>The Haters of GOD.</HI> And some <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, who are <HI>in Labours more abundant,</HI> often have a notable Ex∣periment of it, That when they have been upon some <HI>special Service</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Devil</HI> (who has a most inveterate <HI>Hatred,</HI> where he sees a CHRIST most <HI>Honoured,</HI> and studied and re∣sembled;
<PB N="19" REF="002666_0013_0FE5FB49DF5ACB60"/>and who has a marvellous <HI>Energy</HI> on the Minds of a multitude; I say, To <HI>give him his Due,</HI> — the <HI>Devil</HI>) in some odd and strange Occurrences, that one could hardly have dreamt of, raises a Storm of <HI>Obloquies</HI> upon them; a Storm of silly, senseless, wretched <HI>Slanders</HI> upon them; diffused it may be all a foolish Country over. The Men of GOD, are but <HI>Honoured,</HI> in all the Venom, that <HI>Satan</HI> and his Instruments may spit upon them.</P>
<P>All this while, I feel my self still in <HI>this World.</HI> The last Article is enough to render the proof of <HI>that</HI> very sensible! But then, lastly, Let us get for∣wards, into the <HI>World to come. There, there,</HI> will be <HI>Honours</HI> indeed; Oh! what <HI>Honours!</HI>— be∣stowed on the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; Eternal <HI>Honours</HI> bestowed by His Eternal FA∣THER! The <HI>Honours</HI> wherein that Promise will be accomplished; Rev. II. 10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> O unfainting <HI>Servants</HI> of your SAVIOUR; Was there ever any <HI>Honour</HI> upon Earth, to be com∣pared unto what you shall receive, when you shall at your <HI>Departure,</HI> find a kind Reception with your Almighty SAVIOUR, and being by His Angels, <HI>presented Faultless before the presence of His Glory with exceeding Joy,</HI> hear Him saying to you, <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant; enter into thy Masters Joy!</HI> But then, can you comprehend, what will be your <HI>Honours,</HI> when your SAVI∣OUR shall come, to be <HI>Glorified in His Saints, and
<PB N="20" REF="002666_0014_0FE5FB4B6F836808"/>to be admired in all them that believe!</HI> What your <HI>Honours,</HI> when the <HI>Day of Judgment</HI> shall arrive, wherein the <HI>Book of Remembrance will be opened,</HI> and all the <HI>Service</HI> you have done for your SA∣VIOUR will be <HI>Remembred</HI> and <HI>Rewarded!</HI> What your <HI>Honours,</HI> when you shall be <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> unto GOD, and have <HI>Power over Nations</HI> given you! What your <HI>Honours,</HI> when you shall <HI>shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of your Father,</HI> and you shall be <HI>filled with all the fulness of GOD!</HI>— All Words are here swallowed up! O Incom∣prehensible <HI>Happiness; O Honours,</HI> infinitely be∣yond every Thing here below! <HI>Honours,</HI> where∣with <HI>Batoons,</HI> and <HI>Sceptres</HI> themselves laid in the Ballance, are but <HI>Baubles,</HI> and Lighter than Va∣nity.</P>
<P N="3">III. But methinks, There should be made a brief Touch upon one Enquiry more; Who is the <HI>Fountain of these Honours?</HI> 'Tis the FATHER of our SAVIOUR. And why does our SAVI∣OUR speak of His FATHER, as concerned in the <HI>Honours</HI> bestowed upon them that <HI>serve</HI> Him? Truly, The <HI>Love</HI> of the FATHER to our SA∣VIOUR, 'tis <HI>Infinite, Infinite!</HI> He has once and again proclaimed it, <HI>This is my beloved SON.</HI> He is called, Col. I. 13. <HI>The Son of His Love.</HI> Such, I tell you truly, such is the <HI>Love</HI> of the Almigh∣ty FATHER to the Person, who is the <HI>Bright∣ness of His Glory, and the express Image of His Person,</HI> that He will infinitely <HI>plague them that hate Him.</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="002666_0014_0FE5FB4B6F836808"/>And when they that are Baptized into His Name, shall be in a <HI>Conspiracy,</HI> to Dethrone Him, De∣grade Him, Ungod Him, 'tis impossible to give a more <HI>Bitter Provocation</HI> to His Majesty. Verily, It provokes a <HI>Wrath unto the uttermost. O our un∣happy Mother, we are Mourning, we are Trembling for thee!</HI>— On the other hand, What will He do for them whom His <HI>Love</HI> does <HI>constrain</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> Him? O become the <HI>Servants</HI> of your SAVIOUR; 'Tis to <HI>serve</HI> the SON of GOD, and a SON Infinitely <HI>Dear</HI> unto Him; Infinite∣ly more <HI>Dear</HI> than all other Beings. What a <HI>Re∣compence</HI> will His FATHER give to them that <HI>serve</HI> Him? To do <HI>Service</HI> for your SAVIOUR, is to put <HI>Honour</HI> on Him. <HI>Honour, Honour,</HI> shall be the <HI>Recompence.</HI> With <HI>Honour</HI> from His FA∣THER, shall it be <HI>Retaliated.</HI> If you will <HI>serve</HI> Him, you must undergo much <HI>Dishonour</HI> among His Adversaries: <HI>They shall say all manner of Evil against you falsly for my sake,</HI> faith our SAVIOUR. An <HI>Honour</HI> from His FATHER will be your <HI>Compensation.</HI> 'Tis what His <HI>Dear SON,</HI> has desi∣red for you; His <HI>Intercession</HI> has demanded it; <HI>FA∣THER, I will that they have Glory,</HI> says our SA∣VIOUR. And, <HI>Him the FATHER heareth al∣ways.</HI></P>
<P>And now comes the <HI>Conclusion of the Mat∣ter.</HI></P>
<P>But what can this be any other, than an Ir∣resistible Demand upon the whole Auditory? Oh! Become the true <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord JE∣SUS
<PB N="22" REF="002666_0015_0FE5FB4D0822AFF8"/>CHRIST; Come Immediately into the <HI>Service</HI> of your SAVIOUR. Despise not, Refuse not, the <HI>Honours,</HI> which the FATHER of your SAVIOUR has to bestow upon them that <HI>serve</HI> Him. Don't bespeak for your selves that <HI>Shame and Everlasting Contempt,</HI> which is to be the <HI>Por∣tion of the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P>The Proposal is now made; Josh. XXIV. 15. <HI>Chuse you this Day, whom you will serve.</HI> But, Oh! Make a <HI>wise Choice;</HI> A <HI>Choice</HI> which a <HI>Dying Man</HI> would abide by. As for the <HI>other Lords,</HI> which have <HI>had Dominion</HI> over you, Abhor their <HI>Sor∣vice,</HI> Renounce their <HI>Service,</HI> Abandon their cursed <HI>Service.</HI> But, O Embrace the <HI>Service</HI> of your Lovely SAVIOUR; And <HI>Bind</HI> your selves unto it; <HI>Bind</HI> your selves as fast as ever you can; and with the Firmest, but yet the Humblest Pur∣poses. <HI>Bind</HI> your selves in those Terms; Psal. CXVI. 16. <HI>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant.</HI></P>
<P>Having done this, Then contrive what you can, how to make your <HI>All Serviceable</HI> unto the Interests of your SAVIOUR. And often pon∣der on that Noble Question, <HI>What Service may I do for my Admirable SAVIOUR?</HI></P>
<P>Thus Engage, Embark in a <HI>Service,</HI> which never yet any one Repented of!</P>
<P>But then, If such as These may be judged, [And most certainly, a <HI>Good Judgement</HI> will pro∣nounce them so!] <HI>The Words of the Wise,</HI> May they be <HI>as Goads,</HI> and come with a singular
<PB N="23" REF="002666_0015_0FE5FB4D0822AFF8"/><HI>Pungency</HI> and <HI>Cogenoy</HI> unto the <HI>Candidates of the Ministry</HI> rising as the <HI>Hopes of the Flocks</HI> among us!</P>
<P>O you whose Friends have set you apart for the Service of your SAVIOUR in the Work of the Gospel; Be perswaded <HI>Betimes</HI> to <HI>Consecrate</HI> your selves unto it; and come into this Resolu∣tion; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, To serve Thee, shall be the Chief End, and the Grand Work of my Life!</HI> Come into this Disposition; <HI>To be a Servant of a Glorious CHRIST, shall be the very Top of my Am∣bition!</HI> This Disposition; <HI>If a Glorious CHRIST will please to accept of Service from me, This is the highest Advancement that I can be Ambitious of!</HI> Be continually full of <HI>Projections,</HI> what <HI>Service</HI> you can do for a Glorious LORD. If any Thing ap∣pear to you a <HI>Service</HI> for that Glorious LORD, and for His Kingdom, wait not for any further <HI>Motive,</HI> to bespeak your Industrious and Coura∣geous coming into it. Be armed against all the <HI>Discouragements,</HI> and all the <HI>Difficulties,</HI> and all the <HI>Temptations,</HI> which Fidelity in that <HI>Service</HI> will certainly expose you to. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you are certain, That whenever you attempt any signal <HI>Service</HI> for your LORD, you shall presently find some notable <HI>Humiliation</HI> ordered for you, yet with a true <HI>Spirit of Martyrdom</HI> go valiantly thorough all, that you have before you. [<HI>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour!</HI>] Be arm'd in a View of the <HI>Honours,</HI> which the FATHER of your SAVIOUR will one Day bring you to! If
<PB N="24" REF="002666_0016_0FE5FB4E9C87F868"/>any have been Ordain'd, before they have had this PIETY flaming in them, let it at least <HI>fol∣low,</HI> what it should <HI>precede:</HI> And let them Read, what <HI>Bernard</HI> writes unto <HI>Ardutius!</HI></P>
<P>If the Glorious <HI>GOD of your Life</HI> shall order it, that a <HI>Premature Death,</HI> shall prevent the <HI>Service</HI> you intend for Him, He will <HI>accept your willing Mind;</HI> and reserve <HI>Inexpressible Opportunities</HI> for you in that Heavenly World, where tho' the <HI>Saints rest from their Labours,</HI> yet we read, <HI>They rest not</HI> from the Praises of the Lord. It is not a place or state of <HI>Idleness;</HI> every one has his <HI>Work</HI> there assign'd unto him.</P>
<P>A promising STEVENS, and HOLBROKE, and PIERPONT, and THOMPSON, and some others, may thus <HI>take the Wings of the Morning,</HI> and in the <HI>Morning</HI> of their <HI>Youth,</HI> take their Flight unto the Blissful Regions. But if <HI>they</HI> and their <HI>short-liv'd Brethren</HI> might speak from thence, they would certainly say unto us, <HI>O serve the Glorious LORD, and never count any Service too much to be done for Him. No Man shall be a Loser by any Service he does for Him! 'Tis impossible for any one to make too early a Dedication of himself unto the Service of this Glorious LORD. All the Labours, and all the Sorrows, and all the sad Things, which must be undergone in the Service, are abundantly Re∣compensed in this Glorious World. One Hour here makes amends for all.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, we will greatly Lament the <HI>Loss</HI> therein sustained by our Churches, and the
<PB N="25" REF="002666_0016_0FE5FB4E9C87F868"/>Dark <HI>Signs of the Times,</HI> in such Eclipses. Yea, we will <HI>speak</HI> of them in our <HI>Lamentations.</HI> It would be a worse than a <HI>Stoical Apathy</HI> to do otherwise.</P>
<P>Among those who have begun to do some <HI>Service</HI> for our Glorious LORD, and have been <HI>singularly Furnished</HI> for it, but might <HI>not be suffered to continue</HI> in it <HI>by reason of Death,</HI> I know not why a Modest <HI>Commemoration</HI> may not be allow'd unto Mr. THOMAS WALTER; Who had not passed <HI>Four times Seven</HI> Years of a <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> before a Period unto all Prospect of any further <HI>Service</HI> from him here, is hastened upon him.</P>
<P>I am not without Apprehension, that it may be some small <HI>Service</HI> unto the Best Interests, for me to take a brief Notice of something that may render his Memory <HI>Valuable,</HI> and something that may render it <HI>Profitable,</HI> to us.</P>
<P>The former part of his Life,—I pass o∣ver in <HI>Silence:</HI> But something that occurr'd in the <HI>Close</HI> of it, may be not altogether unworthy of some Notice with us.</P>
<P>After such un Uncommon Symptom of <HI>Merit</HI> in him, as his being Ordained by his Venerable <HI>Grandfather,</HI> and Installed a <HI>Collegue</HI> with his De∣sirable <HI>Father,</HI> in the Pastoral Care of a precious Flock, who for their Generous <HI>Love unto their Ministers,</HI> have set an Example to all the Churches in the Country; he soon gave Demonstrations of those Rare <HI>Abilities,</HI> which <HI>exceedingly Distin∣guished</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="002666_0017_0FE5FB5030A579D8"/>him. [So Young <HI>Austin</HI> becomes a Col∣legue to Old <HI>Valerius</HI> in his Bishoprick!]</P>
<P>But that which makes him deserve to be re∣membred with the more <HI>Honour</HI> among us, is, That his Heart was fixed in his Purposes and Endeavours to employ all those Bright <HI>Abilities</HI> in the <HI>Service</HI> of CHRIST and for the <HI>Churches of This Country.</HI></P>
<P>He was a strong Champion for those <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> in which <HI>those Churches</HI> have been esta∣blished; And a great Reader of the Books which assert those <HI>Doctrines;</HI> among which those of a Judicious OWEN had a special Relish with him; ever <HI>Lamenting,</HI> ever <HI>Confuting,</HI> the Things which he saw <HI>tending to Corrupt</HI> the young Minds of those that are under a Designation to <HI>feed the Flocks in the high Mountains of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>To which I must add, That his faithful and steady Adherence to the <HI>Puritan</HI> Principles of <HI>Instituted Worship,</HI> and— <HI>What saith the Scrip∣ture?</HI>—was very considerable; when <HI>Tempta∣tions</HI> of, I know not what <HI>Glory,</HI> to desert them, could not seduce him to an <HI>Infamous Apostasy.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Ministry</HI> was notably calculated for THIS, above all Intentions; That a Glorious CHRIT may in the whole System and Business of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> be duly Acknowledged, and have a due Homage paid unto Him. And he pressed this Advice upon some Candidates of the Ministry, with whom he was acquainted; <HI>Preach CHRIST, my Friend, Preach CHRIST, as
<PB N="27" REF="002666_0017_0FE5FB5030A579D8"/>much as ever you can.</HI> And the FATHER of our Glorious LORD, has put this <HI>Honour</HI> upon Him, that many of His People have expressed an <HI>Ex∣traordinany Esteem</HI> for him; And more than Two or Three of his <HI>Acute Composures</HI> have been pub∣lished. On the <HI>Last</HI> of these, I may make this Remark; That tho' it be composed with a great strength of <HI>Ratiocination,</HI> and be embellished with more than a little <HI>Erudition,</HI> yet he wrote with his own <HI>Hand,</HI> in a manner nothing of it: But Languishing under much <HI>Pain,</HI> and such <HI>Weakness</HI> as kept him on his Bed continually, it was all written from his <HI>Mouth,</HI> by the Pen of a beloved Friend, unto whom he dictated. A Specimen <HI>This,</HI> of those <HI>Intellectual Powers</HI> in him, which if he had lived, would have anon brought him into the Number of the famous <HI>Gualterus</HI>'s and <HI>Waltherus</HI>'s, that make a Figure in the Ca∣talogue of <HI>Literators.</HI> And yet, these <HI>Powers</HI> were always beautified and varnished with a conspicuous <HI>Modesty</HI> in him, which caused him to assume unto himself no more, than if he had been, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> of old, (in imitation of the Apostles Elegancy, in his <HI>Elachistoteros</HI>) elegant∣ly called himself, <HI>Omnium Postremissimus.</HI></P>
<P>But that wherein I most propose the Edifi∣cation of the Survivors, is a short Account of the LAST HOURS that passed over him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thomas Gualterus Tabifico Morbo extinctus,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Bartholinus,</HI> he must now be a Companion to. He lay many Months Languish∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0"/>of that <HI>English Disease,</HI> a <HI>Consumption:</HI> Where∣in he over and over again went thorough that <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> in which he made his just Reflections on all the Errors of a <HI>Vain Youth,</HI> which a <HI>disadvantageously Good Temper</HI> might have betray'd him to: Often saying, <HI>I have been a wretched Fool; the greatest Fool in the World!</HI> And he underwent the <HI>saving Work</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT in <HI>Repetitions</HI> of it; First exceedingly <HI>Convincing</HI> and <HI>Abasing</HI> of him; then shewing him the <HI>Remedy</HI> provided for him in a SAVI∣OUR, and helping him to make his Flight un∣to it; and causing him thereupon to grow in his confirmed <HI>Resolutions</HI> to live unto GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Repetitions</HI> of these Operations, did not hinder it, but that on the Day before he died, he had a Soul wonderfully distressed with Fears of his Miscarrying at the last: Saying, <HI>Oh! 'Tis a great Thing to Die!</HI>— Under these Distresses he importunately call'd for the Instructions and Assistances of <HI>One</HI> for whom he had some De∣ference; Who, in Conjunction with his <HI>Father,</HI> again set before him the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD,</HI> which he had himself preached unto others. What passed shall not be now re∣lated; only one or two Passages it may not be amiss to mention. When it was urged upon him; <Q>You have been a notable <HI>Disputant</HI> in your Time; what they call a <HI>Logician:</HI> you have un∣derstood an <HI>Argument.</HI> I pray, what will you make of this <HI>Argument?</HI> The <HI>Proposition</HI> is; <HI>Our
<PB N="29" REF="002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0"/>Glorious LORD, the true Witness, who delivereth Souls, hath solemnly declared, HIM THAT COMES UNTO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.</HI> Your <HI>Assumption</HI> is; <HI>But I come unto Him; and heartily and earnestly Beg of Him, and would Hope in Him, to do for me and on me, every thing that He does to them that come unto Him.</HI> Now the <HI>Conclusion;— Therefore I fear that He will not Receive me, but cast me off!</HI> Is this a Right <HI>Con∣clusion?</HI> Did you use to Argue so?</Q> His Answer was, <HI>I find I have a Busy Adversary; And he would make this perverse Conclusion for me!</HI>—</P>
<P>His Father then came upon his <HI>Unbelief</HI> with such victorious and overwhelming Remonstran∣ces; <Q>My dear Son, Were our SAVIOUR visi∣bly here, as once in the Days of His Humilia∣tion, and should you go prostrate your self before Him, and beseech of Him to have Com∣passion on you, and give you an Heart to Love Him, can you imagine, that He would Reject you? Now, what a strange thing is this <HI>Un∣belief:</HI> to be discouraged from <HI>That</HI> which car∣ries an infinite Encouragement in it! As if His <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> or our <HI>Access</HI> to Him were the less for His being on the Throne of His <HI>Glory.</HI></Q> This also removed not the Desponden∣cies. But the Servants of GOD, (whereof there were more than <HI>Two or Three</HI>) in the Chamber, then joined in pouring out Supplications for him, That the <HI>Comforter</HI> who should <HI>relieve his Soul,</HI> might not be <HI>far from</HI> him; and that he
<PB N="30" REF="002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18"/>might be <HI>filled with Peace and Joy in Believing;</HI> and that he might <HI>finish well,</HI> and with such Tri∣umphs over the <HI>Last Enemy,</HI> as might Revive those who were now praying for him, and en∣tertain the People of GOD.</P>
<P>From <HI>This Hour</HI> (It was now Saturday-noon) <HI>Satisfactions</HI> and <HI>Consolations</HI> continually grew up∣on him. He said, when some of us parted with him, <HI>If I perish, I will perish in the Hands of my SAVIOUR: And, tho' He slay me, I will trust in Him!</HI> His <HI>Fears</HI> were anon swallowed up in the <HI>Hopes,</HI> of a <HI>Glory</HI> now prepared for him: Yea, in the <HI>Joys</HI> of a <HI>Salvation</HI> which he had after a suitable Agony, gain'd the <HI>Assurance</HI> of. He now longed for his <HI>Departure,</HI> to be <HI>with CHRIST.</HI> He kept saying, (as his admired <HI>Calvin</HI> before him) <HI>How long, Lord, How long? Oh! Come quickly!</HI> And, <HI>Why is His Chariot so long a coming; Why tarry the Wheels of His Chariot?</HI> But then, he asked, whether he <HI>did well,</HI> in <HI>longing</HI> so much to be gone?</P>
<P>He said, <HI>I shall be the most Glorious Instance of Sovereign Grace in all Heaven!</HI> And he added, <HI>I have no more to do here; but I shall Serve and Glo∣rify CHRIST to all Eternity!</HI> And then, <HI>Lord, Now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>He laid mighty Charges on some <HI>Young Persons</HI> that were near him; <Q>To fear GOD, and prize His CHRIST <HI>Betimes;</HI> and by no means to de∣lay <HI>Repentance</HI> one Day longer: For the longer they delay'd it, the more Backward they would
<PB N="31" REF="002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18"/>find themselves unto it. <HI>He said;</HI> They might think, that for them to engage in the Ways of PIETY, would be to abandon all Joy and Pleasure; but this is a great Mistake: Let them try the Practice of it, and it will never be Re∣pented of.</Q></P>
<P>When the Morning of the <HI>Lords Day</HI> [Jan. 10.] arrived, he expressed an Expectation, that He should be <HI>That Day in Paradise.</HI> His Father told him, <Q>I am going to the <HI>House of GOD,</HI> which is the <HI>Gate of Heaven;</HI> but I hope, You are go∣ing to <HI>Heaven it self,</HI> to join with the <HI>Assembly Above.</HI></Q> He replied, O! <HI>I love that Glorious Church!</HI> His Father added, <Q>I am going also to the <HI>Ta∣ble</HI> of the Lord; but I hope, You are going to <HI>Drink of the Fruit of the Vine New</HI> with CHRIST in the <HI>Kingdom of his Father.</HI></Q> He replied, <HI>O! And without Price!</HI> At Noon, his Father going to the Afternoon Service, and supposing that he should not (as he <HI>did not</HI>) see him any more, took his Farewel of him, in those Words; <HI>My Child, The Lord JESUS receive thy Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Echo</HI> from him to it was,— <HI>And the Lord fit it for His Re∣ception!</HI> He continued in Heaven-ward Aspira∣tions, till towards the close of the Afternoon∣Service, when he fell a smiling: And one asking him the Reason of it, he only made an <HI>Unintel∣ligible</HI> Answer, which intimated as if an <HI>admira∣ble Consort,</HI> in <HI>Singing</HI> the Praises of his Re∣deemer now entertained him. So he expired; which I doubt not at all to express in the Terms
<PB N="32" REF="002666_0020_0FE5F9FA419F5FF0"/>I find in the Epitaph of a noted Person, <HI>Anima CHRISTI appetentissima, in CHRISTI Gremium evo∣lavit.</HI></P>
<P>Having made this brief Report, not without some View, that it may do something of that <HI>Good,</HI> which if he had lived, <HI>he</HI> would have done more Abundantly, I shall now add no more but This; GOD will <HI>Honour</HI> the YOUNG MEN, whom the <HI>Service</HI> of His CHRIST shall be dear unto!</P>

<P>IT will be no disagreeable <HI>Digression</HI> from the Subject we have been upon, but be as well a <HI>Direction</HI> to the Candidates of the Ministry, as in some degree a <HI>Description</HI> of him whom we have been speaking of; to recite some excellent and expressive Words, of that Great and Good Man, the admirable <HI>WITSIUS,</HI> in his Noble Oration, <HI>De Theologo Modesto.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>Monstra mihi Hominem, qui sui neque Contemptor neque Ad∣mirator fit; qui Divinae munificentiae Dona, procul Invidia, aeque pretio in aliis aestimet; qui Affectus in Ordinem cogere, et Ani∣mum, Linguam, stylum Moderari didicit; qui res quasque suis prudenter Momentis Librat; Easque ita prosequitar uti Singula∣rum genio convenit; qui neque Rigidus neque Mollis est, sed tractabilis: Sine Pusillanimitate Lenis, sine Lentitudine Patiens, sine Tetricitate Gravis.—Sine Jactantia Fortis, sine Contumacia Constans: Talem, inquam, mihi monstrato hominem, et eum ego vere MODESTUAI VIRUM appellabo. Qui idem si omnes hasce Virtutes ad verum Divinarum tractationem conferet, iisque Reve∣rentiam
<PB N="33" REF="002666_0020_0FE5F9FA419F5FF0"/>addet que tremendis Religionis nostrae Mysterijs debetur, eundem ego MODESTUM Salutabo THEOLOGUM; Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assur∣gam, in Illius amplexus ruam, Illum Exosculabor, Illius pectori admovebo meum, arctoque amoris nexu comprimam, donec Venera∣bilem istum Characterem menti meae impressero.</HI></Q>
<P>The Young Ministers who have this lovely Pourtraiture of a St. <HI>Modestus</HI> thus before them, do not want, that it should be <HI>Translated</HI> into their Mother-Tongue for their understanding of it. And if they are so <HI>Wise,</HI> as to maintain a <HI>Low</HI> but <HI>Just</HI> Opinion of <HI>Themselves;</HI> with not a base <HI>Envy</HI> at, but a due <HI>Value</HI> for, the Worth to be own'd in <HI>Others:</HI> If they Govern their <HI>Passions</HI> with <HI>Moderation;</HI> and manage their <HI>Sen∣timents</HI> of Things according to the real <HI>Importance</HI> of them: If they are discreetly <HI>Treatable;</HI> with Discretion <HI>Gentle</HI> and <HI>Patient; Grave</HI> but not <HI>Sour; Stout</HI> but not <HI>Vain; Constant</HI> without <HI>Ob∣stinacy:</HI> And if having such Good Qualities beautifying of them, they treat the Mysteries of our <HI>Holy Religion</HI> with the <HI>Reverence</HI> which is due unto them; They will then give such a <HI>Translation</HI> of it, as will be not only <HI>Intelligible</HI> to all People whatsoever, but also render them∣selves <HI>Amiable</HI> to all the People of GOD, among whom they are to <HI>Shine as Lights in the World.</HI></P>
