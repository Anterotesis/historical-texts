<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM, IV. 4.</BIBL>
<P>Stand in awe, and Sin not —.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD Calls upon us <HI>this Day</HI> to <HI>Stand in awe of Him;</HI> for He hath terribly shaken the Earth under us, and threatn'd to send us down quick into the Pit. At the same time, He also encourageth us to <HI>Hope in His Mercy.</HI> We might have been suddenly destroy'd, and that without remedy. Yesterday might have been the last Sabbath, and the last Opportunity of hearing GOD speaking to us in His Word; but Adored be the divine Patience &amp; Long-suffering! Our gracious LORD hath chosen rather to Warn us by a very aw∣ful Providence, and then to give a further space for Repentance. O that His Goodness might lead us to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. We are now <HI>Assembled</HI> in His Name and Fear, to humble our selves under GOD's Mighty Hand, to Cry to Him to turn from the Fierceness of His Angery, and to Praise Him for his wonderful Deliverance O that I could speak, and you Hear under the deep impres∣sion of those Things!</P>
<P>The Penman of this Psalm was <HI>David;</HI> the Oc∣casion of it is uncertain. It seems to have been made <Q>when he was dissress'd either by <HI>Absalem,</HI> or <HI>Saul</HI> or by some other great and powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Opening of the Text was omitted in the Preaching</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="002954_0004_0FE6A4BDAAF2E750"/>The words of my Text are rendred and understood by learned Men with some variety. The Word, says a worthy <HI>Divine</HI> signifies any moving of the Heart; the <HI>Septuagint</HI> render it, Be angry, and Sin not. Which Words being us'd by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 4.26. are suppos'd by some to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Quotation from this Psalm. Others render it by word which signi∣fies to tremble or shake for fear <HI>Piscator</HI> gives the sense thus; Be mov'd with fear of the anger of GOD. Which is agreeable to our own <HI>Version,</HI> Stand in Awe. There is also some difference among <HI>Expositors</HI> re∣specting the Persons to whom these words are directed. Some think they are directed to his Enemies, that they shou'd fear GOD and not Sin against Him by their opposition to <HI>David's</HI> Person and Government, who was anointed by GOD's especial Direction and Com∣mand. Others rather understand the words as direct∣ed to his Friends, that they shou'd stand in awe of GOD's terrible Majesty under their distressing troubles, and not sin by murmuring against GOD, or taking any forbidden Courses to Extricate themselves. However it is plain, that these words are spoken to a professing People in a time of Calamity, and I may from them observe this Doctrine,</P>
<Q>DOCT. <HI>IT is the Duty of particular Persons and of a Professing People in times of great Distress, to Stand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin.</HI></Q>
<P>IT is our Duty at all times to <HI>fear that glorious and fearful Name, the LORD our GOD,</HI> and especially when He displays his terrible Majesty in awful Judgments, we shou'd then look above Second Causes, and obey that word which GOD spake to his People in a time when their Hearts were ready to fail them for fear, Isa. 8.12, 13. <HI>Say ye not, a Confe∣deracy,— Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</HI> We
<PB N="3" REF="002954_0005_0FE6A4BDC6B5E928"/>must at such a time Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts — We must have our minds impress'd with an holy awe, a reverential fear of his terrible Majesty, and give him the Glory of his infinite Power, Justice, Holiness, Faithfulness and Mercy, and other admirable Perfecti∣ons which shine forth in his judicial Dispensations; and in that seasonable help which he affords his Peo∣ple under them; Instead of being Slavishly afraid of Evil, which fear brings a snare. We shou'd Exercise a religious filial fear of GOD as <HI>Job</HI> said, Job 23.15. <HI>When I consider, I am afraid of him.</HI> We should be deeply concern'd, and afraid at the tokens of GOD's displeasure, <HI>Even when his Wrath is kindled but a little, and begins to burn;</HI> when he gives us to sing both of Mercy and Judgment. And being mov'd with fear of GOD's displeasure, we shou'd put away our Sins which stir up his Anger, and are the ground of the Controversy between GOD and us. We should be afraid of offending GOD by breaking his Command∣ments, and accordingly should Repent of, and put far away those Sins wereby we have transgressed his Law. Surely it is meet to be said unto GOD at such a time, <HI>I have born Chastisement, I will not offend any more. That which I see not, teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more,</HI> Job 34.31, 32. It is the Duty of a Person or a People thus to stand in Awe, and not Sin; to Fear the Lord and depart from Evil. Here, I wou'd in a practical way, and with a particular Application to our selves, Consider several Sins which a Person or People under threat∣ning Judgments shou'd put away in the Exercise of an holy Awe of GOD, and dread of his righteous Displeasure.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE shou'd stand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin by Impenitency &amp; Unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a very comprehensive <HI>Head,</HI> however I shall give it a distinct Consideration. When GOD is coming out in Judgments against us, We should
<PB N="4" REF="002954_0006_0FE6A4BF21D1E9C8"/>humble our selves under his mighty hand, loath our selves for our iniquities, and repent in dust and ashes. Thus GOD said to his People of old, Jer. 2.19. <HI>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.</HI> Afflictions should teach us the evil of Sin, and make that most bitter which is the procuring cause of them. When GOD is threatning us we should open our ears to discipline, and from an affecting sight and sense of the evil and danger, the filthiness and odiousness of Sin, heartily grieve because we have offended GOD by breaking his Law, and putting away our Sin, shou'd turn to him. As <HI>Ephra∣im</HI> bemoan'd himself thus, <HI>Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, Surely after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confound∣ed, because I did bear the reproach of my youth,</HI> Jer. 31.18, 19. Again, we shou'd stand in awe, and not Sin by <HI>Unbelief.</HI> This is a very heinous Sin, 1 John 5.10. <HI>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</HI> And it is highly displeasing to GOD, and upon the account of it GOD is provok'd to bring terrible Judgments upon a professing People. Thus when the <HI>Son of God</HI> was manifest in the flesh, and came to his own, they re∣ceived him not. The Body of the Jewish Nation rejected the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> and then GOD cast them off, and poured out his Wrath upon them in a most terrible manner, Rom. 11.20. <HI>Because of unbelief they were broken off</HI> —. When GOD is come out in terrible Judgments against us, we should therefore be convinced of Sin, particularly of this great Sin of not believing in Jesus Christ, and take heed there be
<PB N="5" REF="002954_0007_0FE6A4BF46120FD8"/>not in any of us <HI>an evil Heart of unbelief.</HI> We should give glory to GOD by receiving the record he hath given of his Son, as a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, and rest upon Christ and his righte∣ousness as reveal'd and held forth in the word of the Gospel, for Justification and Eternal Life. Let us then stand in awe of GOD, while under the tokens of his displeasure, repent and turn from all our trans∣gressions; so iniquity shall not be our ruin. Let us, being mov'd with fear fly to Jesus Christ who is the hope of his Israel and the Saviour thereof in times of trouble. Let us not give our gracious Lord reason to complain as of Jerusalem, Matt. 23.37. <HI>O Jeru∣salem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</HI> But let us now fly to Christ and trust under his Shadow, who is <HI>an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest:</HI> Isa. 32.2.</P>
<P>WE shou'd stand in awe of GOD, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>by Neglecting, Corrupting, or Prophaning GOD's Worship and Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second Commandment strictly forbids <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Neglect and Contempt of GOD's Worship; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Corrupting it by the mixture of humane <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And here GOD declareth himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jealous GOD, visiting the iniquities of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Children.</HI> — GOD's Covenant People are joyned to Him in the bond of an holy Covenant and he Expresseth his Indignation against all false Worship, as against spiritual Whoredom, being the Violation of this Covenant. Ezek. 16.26. — <HI>And hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.</HI> We should then when under GOD's afflictive Hand, stand in awe of Him, and take heed we do not use or approve any Religious Worship not Instituted by GOD
<PB N="6" REF="002954_0008_0FE6A4CAB3BA7E20"/>Himself: That we use not any <HI>Visible Signs,</HI> as Means of Worship which GOD hath not appointed, lest GOD pour out his anger and his fury upon us, as He threatned, Jer. 7.20. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</HI> And then let us take heed we do not neglect any of His Ordinances and Institutions: But look to it that we be in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the LORD blameless. Let us Pray to GOD daily in the Name of CHRIST, Read and Meditate on his Word, and carefully improve the Opportunities we have for Publick Worship. When GOD gives such, Let us not make light of them, as they who went one to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize, <HI>Matt.</HI> 22.5. Lastly, let us manifest a high esteem for the <HI>Seals of the New Testament.</HI> If there be any that have not been <HI>Baptised,</HI> let them obey that Word, <HI>Repent, and be baptised every one of you in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins,</HI> — <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 2.38. If any neglect to seek Baptism for their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Let them awfully consider of his anger <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Moses,</HI> for not Circumcising his Child, Exod. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 25. — <HI>The Lord met him, and sought to kill</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Or if there are any who live in the neglect <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sacrament of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> who do not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and shew forth the Lord's Death at his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as GOD's Word requires. Let them be Ex∣horted to prepare for, and come up to that Ordinance, <HI>Being moved with fear;</HI> for you may bring GOD's Judgments upon you by living in the neglect of this duty, as well as by attending it Unworthily.</P>
<P>Again, LET us stand in awe, and take heed we do not offend the glorious GOD, <HI>by a profane irreverent use of his Name, or any of his holy Ordinances;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002954_0009_0FE6A4CACEADDBB8"/>for GOD assure<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>, <HI>He will not hold such guiltless,</HI> Thus when <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> were slain by fire. GOD said, Lev. 10.3.— <HI>This is it which the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified by them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.</HI> If we wou'd not have GOD to be a consuming fire to us, We must glorifie Him in the Manner of our Attending on holy Ordinances. Heb. 12.28, 29. — <HI>Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God ac∣ceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.</HI> If we allow our selves to come into GOD's presence without a due sense of the Majesty &amp; Glory of GOD, &amp; of our own meanness and vileness; without a due solemnity of Spirit, in a heed∣less customary manner; we provoke GOD to Sanctify himself upon us by breaking out against us in terrible Judgments. 1 Cor. 11.29, 30. <HI>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth &amp; drinketh</HI>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>or</HI> Judgment.</NOTE> <HI>dam∣nation to himself, not discerning the Lords body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WE shou'd stand in awe, and not Sin, <HI>by Pro∣phaning the Lord's-Day.</HI></P>
<P>THE Keeping of a <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> or Day of holy Rest to the LORD is of Divine and Perpetual Obli∣gation, as the Fourth Commandment declares. The First Day of the Week since CHRIST's Resurrection on that Day, is the Sabbath; as appears by the Practice of the Apostles who were divinely inspired, with respect to those Matters which were of general concern to the Church: Act. 20.7. <HI>And upon the first day of the week, when the Disciples came to∣gether to break bread, 'Paul preached unto them</HI> —. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. — <HI>Upon the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him</HI> —. And this is agreably call'd, <HI>The
<PB N="8" REF="002954_0010_0FE6A4CC5DFAFCE0"/>Lord's Day,</HI> Rev. 1.10. Now GOD requires his People, to whom He gives his <HI>Sabbath</HI> as a Sign, to Sanctify it by Resting from all Unnecessary Worldly Business, and from Recreations lawful at other times, And then by spending the whole time, unless when works of Necessity or Mercy take us off, in the Secret, Private &amp; Publick Worship of GOD. It is our Privilege that we have the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and very strong are our Obligations <HI>to Remember, and keep it Holy:</HI> unless we do it, Religion will languish, and GOD will be provoked to bring terrible Judgments upon us. Jer. 17.21, 24, 27. <HI>Thus saith the LORD, Take heed to your selves, and bear no burden on the Sab∣bath-day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem. And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this City on the Sabbath-Day, but hallow the Sabbath-Day, to do no work therein. But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-Day, and not to bear a burden, even en∣tring in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath∣Day: then will I kindle a Fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</HI> Let us then take care and Sanctify the Lords-Day. Blessed be GOD the strict observation of the Sabbath has been no small part of the glory of NEW-ENGLAND, and of BOSTON: O let us take heed and beware of every thing that would stain this glory! Let us therefore remember the Sabbath, and bear it in mind, especially when it draws nigh, that we may be disintangled from all Worldly Cares, and ready to enter into this holy Rest.</P>
<P>In the Scriptural Account of the Creation, the Darkness is reckon'd before the Light of the Natural Day. And the Evening and the Morning were the Second Day, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.8. Agreable to this the Jewish Sab∣hath was from Evening to Evening, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.32. And <HI>Nehemiah</HI> commanded the Gates to be shut when it
<PB N="9" REF="002954_0011_0FE6A4CC81A1B1B0"/>began to be dark before the Sabbath, <HI>Neh.</HI> 13.19. which by reason of the Mountains round about and near <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> seems to have been about Sun∣setting at furthest. The Christian Sabbath is the first Day of the Week. And it must begin as other Days. As to the exact Time of CHRIST's Resurrection, it is not set forth in Scripture.</P>
<P>LET us then dispatch our Worldly Business towards the Evening, before the Sabbath Day. Such as are in Trade, shou'd take Care that their Shops be shut seasonably. Such as have Meat or any other things to buy, should take Care to do it before Night. Or whatever <HI>Secular Business</HI> is to be done, we ought to finish it so that we may not be cumber'd about it, when we should be keeping an <HI>holy Rest</HI> to the Lord. On the <HI>Lord's Day Morning,</HI> we should rise early, if our bodily Health will allow it, and take Care that we and our Housholds separate a whole Day for the Service of GOD; and that we do not thro' Covetousness allow them in any unnecessary worldly Labour. There must be no <HI>Burden</HI> born on the Sabbath, No! not so much as to setch or carry any wearing Apparel: yea on this Day the Beasts must Rest from Labor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <Q><HI>Thou shalt not do any Work, thou nor thy Cattle</HI> partly to teach us to exercise Mercy toward the brute Creatures, partly because the use of Cattle must have drawn along with it the Atten∣dance or Employment of Men.</Q> The Rest of Man and Beast must not be interrupted without weighty Cause. We must look to it that it be a Work of Necessity or Mercy, or else we may not employ Men about it.</P>
<P>Again, As we must take Care that our Children and Servants be not Idle at home; so <HI>that they attend the Publick Worship.</HI> GOD requires that we &amp; ours appear before him to do him <HI>Homage</HI> on this Day, and we must take Care to go up to the
<PB N="10" REF="002954_0012_0FE6A4D884CC2E10"/>House of the Lord; and we must not neglect the Assembling our selves together on this Day: We must see to it that our Seat be not Empty; and that our Children &amp; Servants do not absent themselves; unless when Sickness, the necessary Occasions of the Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> require it. And tho' it be true, that the Sabbath is but one Day in the Week: yet there is Prudence to be used on the Evening after the Sabbath-Day, that we do not lose what we have wrought or got on the Lord's Day, by going Abroad into vain Company, by visits of meer Ceremony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but rather Employ the Time in Catechising our Children &amp; Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then be Exhorted to Keep the Sabbath holy. Let us turn away our foot from the Sabbath, from doing our Pleasure on GOD's holy Day. Let us call the Sabbath our delight, the holy of the Lord honourable, and honour him, not doing our own ways, nor finding our own pleasures, nor speaking our own words. And let us be awakened to great Diligence &amp; Care herein from the Warnings GOD hath given us, and by the shakes of his Rod over us. GOD lately Visited us with a terrible <HI>Storm</HI> on the Evening before the Sabbath Day-light; And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with an amazing Shock of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> on the Evening after it. O let it not be said that GOD spake once, yea twice, and yet we regarded it not!</P>
<P N="4">4. WE shou'd stand in aw, and not Sin <HI>by the Neglect of Family 'Duties.</HI></P>
<P>IT is our Duty to resolve with <HI>Joshua, As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24.15. And with <HI>David,</HI> Psa. 101.2. <HI>I will walk within my House with a perfect Heart.,</HI> We must walk as in the fight of GOD, and approve our Hearts to him by a conscientious discharge of Family Duties, par∣ticularly when his Judgments have an especial threat∣ning Aspect on our Houses. We shou'd be moved
<PB N="11" REF="002954_0013_0FE6A4D89B7674E0"/>with an holy Fear to put all Iniquity far from our Tabernacles, and to serve GOD in them. For GOD threatens the Wicked, <HI>Job</HI> 27, 28, 29. <HI>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity: and the earth shall rise up against him. The increase of his house shall de∣part, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</HI></P>
<P>Now then, that GOD hath caused our Houses to shake under us, and threaten'd to bury us in the Ruins of them; let us be excited to Worship GOD constantly in and with our Families. Let us offer to him the Morning &amp; Evening Sacrifice of Prayer. For surely, If it be a Duty, <HI>to Pray always in every thing, at all times, and with all Prayer,</HI> we can't neglect Family Prayer without great Sin. Let us not then practically deny that GOD who sets the Soli∣tary in Families, by refusing this part of <HI>Social Wor∣ship,</HI> for which we have daily Occasion as well as Op∣portunity. Let us with <HI>David,</HI> Bless our Houshold. Let us thus <HI>Fear God with all our House,</HI> and ex∣press our religious Fear by <HI>Praying always,</HI> as <HI>Cor∣nelius</HI> did <HI>Acts</HI> 10.2. Lest we provoke GOD to Consume us in his Wrath according to that dreadful Imprecation, Jer. 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Fa∣milies that call not upon thy Name.</HI> If the word <HI>Family</HI> be here taken in a large sense, it includes par∣ticular Housholds. O let us join together in asking GOD's Protection and Blessing on our Houses, in seeking the Pardon of our Family Sins, and in Prai∣sing GOD for Family Mercies, lest we provoke GOD to consume us together. Again, <HI>Let us Read the holy Scriptures</HI> in and with our Houses, and teach our Children &amp; Servants the good know∣ledge of the Lord. Let us as 'twas said of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. <HI>Command our Children and Houshold
<PB N="12" REF="002954_0014_0FE6A4D9B7B5FA68"/>after us,— that they may keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Let us set them <HI>Examples</HI> of Sobriety, Righteousness and Godliness: and then use our Authority to Restrain them from all Sin. GOD threaten'd <HI>Eli,</HI> that <HI>he would judge his House,</HI> i.e. <HI>Condemn, Punish it — for the ini∣quity he knew, because his Sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Sam. 3.13. O let us then take heed we do not connive at Sin in our Children or Servants; but do our utmost by seasona∣ble Admonitions &amp; Corrections when needed, to Reclaim them, left GOD be provok'd to enter into Judgment with us, and Punish us for the Sins of our Houses. Let us <HI>bring up</HI> our Children in the <HI>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> And let us do our Duty towards our Servants also, even the meanest of them, considering we have a Master in Heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. Job 31.13, 15. <HI>If I did despise the cause of my man∣servant, or of my maid servant, when they conten∣ded with me: What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I dismiss this Head, I wou'd say, We must stand in aw, and not Sin by being <HI>Unjust in our Family Business,</HI> or by taking any indirect Cour∣ses to Provide for our Families. We must take heed there be no Fraud, Unrighteousness or Oppression in our Trading; the Eighth Commandment requires Justice in Commerce between Man &amp; Man, our ren∣dring to every one his due; and forbids <HI>"whatever may unjustly hinder our own or our Neighbour's Wealth &amp; outward Estate."</HI> There is a flying <HI>Roll</HI> which is call'd the <HI>Curse,</HI> and GOD says, it is for every one that Steals, and threatens to <HI>bring it into the House of the Thief,</HI> and that it shall consume it, Zech. 5.2 — 4.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE must stand in aw, and not Sin by <HI>Quar∣relling &amp; Contending one with another.</HI> When there
<PB REF="002954_0015_0FE6A4D9D8A29848"/>is reason to say, <HI>What means the heat of GOD's Anger?</HI> Then GOD's People should avoid all unchristian Heats, Heart-burnings &amp; Animosities one against another, and endeavour to unite as one Man, in seeking to turn away GOD's Anger from them. It's dreadful indeed for Men to be casting fire Brands, Arrows &amp; Death. For them to seek in their Wrath, in any sort to hurt &amp; wound their Neighbour, either by bitter Words, or injurious Actions. Instead of this, we should do our utmost to extinguish the Fire of Contention; that we may lift up pure hands to GOD without Wrath in servent Supplications, and unite hearts and hands in the great Work of Re∣formation. Let us then obey that word, Eph. 4.31, 32. <HI>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and clamour, and evil-speaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. WE should stand in aw, and <HI>avoid the Sins of Drunkenness &amp; Uncleanness.</HI></P>
<P>I put these together, and indeed they often go together, the former being an especial Provocation to the latter, and therefore forbidden in the seventh Commandment. Prov. 23.31, 32. <HI>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red —. At the last it biteth like a Serpent, and stingeth like an Adder. Thine Eyes shall behold strange women.</HI> Now that GOD hath fulfilled that word, Isa. 24.20. <HI>The Earth shall reel to &amp; fro like a Drunkard;</HI> let us avoid this Sin, and obey that word, Eph. 5.18. <HI>Be not drunk with wine — but be filled with the Spirited.</HI> Let us take the Warning, and not inflame our selves with strong Drink: Let us not indulge this Sin in our selves, or connive at it in others; but avoid all Temptations to it, and be ready in our several Places to bear our Testimony against it. Let the <HI>Civil</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="002954_0016_0FE6A4E240BB1688"/><HI>Authority</HI> be intreated to take Care that <HI>Taverns,</HI> and other Houses for Retailing strong Drink, do not grow so numerous as to become a publick Scandal and hurt to the Religion, and the Morals of our People: And then to keep a strict watch over them, that good Orders may be maintain'd in them. Let such as sell Strong Drink, take heed &amp; beware of being par∣takers with others in this Sin, by suffering Persons to drink to Excess. O do not make a gain of the Sins of others, lest you be drowned with them in Per∣dition. In a word, Let the Inhabitants of the Town be Exhorted to avoid all needless frequenting of <HI>Ta∣verns!</HI> O do not accustom yourselves to go to such Places when you have no Call to it! O do not spend your precious Time, and your Estates there! O do not tarry long at the Wine, to the dishonour of GOD and the hurt of the Religion and good Order of your Families; lest GOD be provoked to make your Houses desolate.</P>
<P>Again, LET us stand in aw and not Sin by <HI>burn∣ing with Unclean Lusts,</HI> and gratifying our carnal In∣clinations.</P>
<P><HI>SODOM</HI> was infamous for the Sins of Unclean∣ness, and <HI>the Lord rained upon them Fire &amp; Brim∣stone from the Lord out of Heaven,</HI> Gen. 19.24. Yea they suffered the Vengeance of eternal Fire, <HI>Jude ver.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. As <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah</HI> giving them∣selves over to Fornication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are set forth for an Example, suffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire. O let us then fly all degrees and kinds of Unclean∣ness, all Temptations and Provocations thereunto! For <HI>Whoremongers &amp; Adulterers God will judge,</HI> Heb. 13.4.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE shou'd stand in aw, and <HI>fly the Sin of Pride.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EVERY one that is proud in Heart, is an abo∣mination to the Lord,</HI> Prov. 16.5. Pride, whereby
<PB N="15" REF="002954_0017_0FE6A4E25CDEDA98"/>Men entertain too high tho'ts of themselves, and seek to exalt themselves above their Fellow-Creatures, yea above GOD himself, is a very provoking Sin, which GOD threatens with terrible Judgments, Isa. 3.5. — <HI>The Child shall behave himself proudly against the Ancient.</HI>— ver.8. <HI>Jerusalem is ruin'd, &amp; Judah is fallen.</HI> ver. 16. <HI>Moreover, the Lord saith, Be∣cause the daughters of Zion are haughty.</HI> ver. 17. <HI>Therefore the Lord will smite</HI> —. Let us then bring every proud Imagination into subjection to the Will of GOD. Now that GOD threatens to level us with the ground, yea to lay us under it, let us lie low in deep Abasement before him. 1 Pet. 5.6. <HI>Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.</HI> Hath not this Sin been declar'd by many, in their high Looks and haughty Carriage, in their ambiti∣ous pursuits of the great things of this World, and the Excess of their Apparel and the like, whereby they have sought to make a greater Appearance than their Estates wou'd allow? The Lord subdue this Lust, which is set first where the Sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> are nam'd, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 10.49. GOD now speaks aloud, and says to us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.20. <HI>Be not high-minded, but seer.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have in weakness and fear, mention'd some of those Sins from which an holy Aw of GOD, should deter us.</P>

<P>USE, I. <HI>LET us all be Exhorted to stand in aw of GOD, and not Sin against Him.</HI> To <HI>sear GOD, and keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>LET us now fear before the Lord, and say as Psal. 119.120. <HI>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.</HI> There's the Voice of GOD crying to us in the inflicted and threatned Judgment. Amos 3.6. <HI>Shall a trumpet
<PB N="16" REF="002954_0018_0FE6A4E727DEBDC8"/>be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> No surely, this terrible Judgment is the Work of GOD, and he speaks aloud to us by it, as Joh. 5.24. <HI>Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</HI> GOD seems to say to us in his Providence, I have given you fair Warning, do not further pro∣voke me. Or, as Hos. 11.8. <HI>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</HI> Let us then re∣lent under GOD's Hand, and by an hearty Re∣pentance turn unto him. <HI>Turn ye, turn ye why will you die, O house of Israel.</HI> Let us fear the Lord and his Goodness; and not after our hardness and impenitent Heart, <HI>treasure up to our selves wrath against the day of wrath,</HI> by abusing the Riches of it. O that we cou'd each of us, with an heart broken for Sin, fly to JESUS CHRIST, who saves his People from their Sins! O that we cou'd as a People, Repent, and turn from our evil ways unto the Lord, our Covenant GOD! Then we might Hope that GOD wou'd turn from the fierceness of his Anger: But if after all that is come upon us, and GOD hath <HI>given us such Deliverance as this,</HI> we remain incorrigible, <HI>and again break his Com∣mandments, will he not be angry with us till he hath consumed us, so that there shall be no remnant, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI>

I say,
<PB N="17" REF="002954_0019_0FE6A4E74B3BFDE8"/>If this be our Case, we shall have Reason to fear the fulfilment of that awful Threatning upon us, ver. 13. <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthi∣ness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</HI> Let the Terrors of the last Night then convince us of the Necessity of Reformation, and quicken us to fly our provoking Sins, as we wou'd hope to escape the amazing Judgments of GOD, yea the Wrath to come. And here tho' I have already mention'd several Sins which an holy Aw of GOD shou'd excite us to forsake, and put far away from us; yet I wou'd further say; Let this terrible Judgment of GOD teach us the great Evil and folly of a <HI>covetous worldly Spirit,</HI> which alas dreadfully prevails in this Land. Our Lord &amp; Judge says to us this Day, <HI>Take heed &amp; beware of Cove∣tousness.</HI> O let us not then immoderately Crave, and with greediness pursue this world's Goods: Let us not Trust in <HI>uncertain Riches,</HI> when GOD hath caus'd the Earth to shake &amp; tremble under us. O do not now pant after the Dust of the Earth? Do not practically say, Your Houses are for ever, when the Foundation on which they stand is mov'd! Lest you, your Houses and Estates perish together in the Day of GOD's Indignation.</P>
<P>Now is it not one sign of the prevailing of this <HI>Evil</HI> that the <HI>weekly Lecture</HI> in this populous Town, is often so poorly attended? I can't but fear, <HI>My Brethren &amp; Nei'bours,</HI> that this <HI>Omission</HI> is provoking to GOD. Certainly we might have a <HI>full Aulitory,</HI> and yet give large Allowances for the <HI>urgent Affairs</HI> of the Town, which require pre∣sent Dispatch. Let us not then be so careful and cumbred about many things as to neglect this <HI>pre∣cious Opportunity.</HI> Let us in this particular, <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> and other things shall
<PB N="18" REF="002954_0020_0FE6A4EFC785E358"/>be added. I am satisfied this wou'd not hinder but promote the Success of our <HI>Secular Business,</HI> thro' GOD's Blessing. And O that we might be quick∣ned in <HI>every Instance</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> towards GOD, and <HI>Charity</HI> towards our Neighbour, to lay up our Treasures in Heaven, and to seek that Kingdom which can't be moved!</P>
<P>Again, Is not <HI>profane Swearing &amp; Cursing be∣come dreadfully Common</HI> with some sorts of People? Now this is an heaven-daring &amp; heinous Iniquity, which GOD is wont severely to Punish. Jer. 23.10. <HI>Because of swearing the Land mourneth</HI>—. Zech. 5.1. — <HI>Behold, a flying Roll.</HI>— ver. 3. <HI>Every one that sweareth shall be cut off on that side.</HI> O let not any for the Time to come, dare thus to set their Mouths against Heaven; but let the dread of GOD fall upon you; <HI>Fear an Oath,</HI> and do not take GOD's sacred Name into your Mouths upon every light &amp; trivial Occasion; do not Call him to <HI>Witness</HI> to a lie, lest he appear as a <HI>swift Witness</HI> against you, and stop your Breath in a moment. Don't imprecate <HI>Curses</HI> on your selves or others, lest the Curse of GOD fall upon you, and you be suddenly sent down to the <HI>Place of Torments,</HI> where is wailing and gnashing of Teeth for ever.</P>
<P>Again, ARE there not such as <HI>set light by Fa∣ther &amp; Mother;</HI> who Refuse to give that Honour which is due to their Parents, their Civil Rulers, Pastors and the like? If there be any such, be warn'd to fly this heinous Sin. <HI>Honor thy Fa∣ther and thy Mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Remember the <HI>Fate</HI> of <HI>Korah, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> that with others of the Children of Israel, gather'd themselves together against <HI>Moses</HI> and against <HI>Aaron,</HI> (<HI>Numb.</HI> 16.) and fly this Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="002954_0021_0FE6A4EFE6BCD308"/>
Again, ARE there not <HI>Evil Customs</HI> prevailing among us, in which we are conform'd to the <HI>present Age?</HI> Tho' GOD forbids this, Rom. 12.2. <HI>Be not conformed to this world.</HI> Let us search them out, and Reform them, lest we be condemned with the World another Day.</P>
<P>BEFORE I dismiss this USE, I wou'd ask leave to Address several sorts of Persons particularly:
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>I take liberty to insert these particulars, tho' they were not deliver'd at that time</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>LET such as are</HI> yet in their Sins, <HI>be convinc'd of their extream hazard; and being mov'd with Fear, fly to CHRIST for Refuge.</HI></P>
<P>WE read of a great <HI>Earthquake</HI> at Midnight, while <HI>Paul &amp; Silas</HI> Pray'd —, after which the <HI>Jailor</HI> came trembling — and said, <HI>Sirs, What must I do to be saved?</HI> Acts 16.25, 26, — 29, 30. An in∣quiry very needful for those to make who are yet under the Guilt &amp; Dominion of Sin, now that GOD re∣veals his Wrath in this amazing Judgment. Know∣ing the Terrors of the Lord, we pray you in Christ's stead, <HI>be ye reconciled to GOD.</HI> O do not go on obstinately in your Sins, lest GOD send you down to the bottomless Pit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> O make haste, make haste to CHRIST! Lay hold of GOD's strength, and make Peace with him. Do not rest secure in a State of Enmity against this GOD who can Arm any of his Creatures against you for your Destruction, and <HI>after he hath kill'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power to cast into Hell,</HI> Luk. 12.5. Now make Supplication to your <HI>Judge,</HI> and cry for Mercy while He is seated on a Throne of Grace, and says, <HI>Come unto me — Look unto me, and be ye-saved</HI> —. And if there be any awakned, as I hope there are not a sew, and bro't to cry out, What must we do to be sav'd? The An∣swer given to the Jailor is ready, ver. 31. <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and then shalt be saved.</HI> Go out to him, trust in him, and submit to him in
<PB N="20" REF="002954_0022_0FE6A4F2D7B62508"/>all his Offices, and your Souls shall live. Here's a City of Refuge, make haste to it, lest you be destroy'd. Who can tell, but GOD designs to make use of this sur∣prising &amp; extraordinary Providence to prepare you to receive and obey the Calls of his Word? O dont neglect this remarkable <HI>Day of Grace!</HI> You are never like to enjoy such another. To Day then while it is call'd to day, Hear GOD's Voice, and harden not your Hearts. Now! Now! Work out your Salvation with fear &amp; trembling, crying to GOD to work in you to will &amp; to do. If you now reject the Offers of the Gospel, there will be great reason to fear that this Judgment will prove a fore∣runner of unavoidable Destruction. And wo to you if after all, you Perish because you will not come to CHRIST that you may have life. <HI>It will be more to∣lerable for Sodom &amp; Gomorrah in the Day of Judg∣ment than for you.</HI> The Lord speak to your hearts, and make you willing in the Day of his Power!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>LET this rouse up</HI> GOD's Children, <HI>and awaken them out of their sleepy Frames.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Wise Virgins</HI> may <HI>slumber &amp; sleep,</HI> Matth. 25.5. But what a Cry is now heard to awaken you? Behold, <HI>The Lord ariseth to shake terribly the Earth.</HI> Arise then, and <HI>trim your Lamps;</HI> Prepare to meet the Lord in the way of his Judgments. Know it, Your Sins may help to pull down Judg∣ments upon GOD's People. <HI>Aaron's &amp; David's</HI> did so. Pray therefore, as Psal. 143.2. <HI>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant</HI> —. Live in the con∣tinual Exercise of Faith &amp; Repentance, and Cry to GOD to spare his People. Stand in the <HI>Gap,</HI> and make Intercession to the Lord of hosts for your Peo∣ple. You may do much to turn away wrath, while you Exercise a strong Faith in the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and plead his <HI>Merits</HI> before the Lord. GOD said to <HI>Moies, Let me <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> that my wrath may wax hot
<PB N="21" REF="002954_0023_0FE6A4F2F2984D10"/>against them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.10. But then you must <HI>Watch</HI> as well as <HI>Pray,</HI> and use your best Endeavours to promote the necessary Work of Reformation, accor∣ding to the Place you are in, and in the faithful Im∣provement of the Advantages GOD puts into your Hands. You must have <HI>no fellowship with the un∣fruitful Works of darkness; but rather reprove them.</HI> O look to GOD then for fresh Influences of his Spi∣rit, and stir up the Grace of GOD in you. Be zea∣lous &amp; active in GOD's Service, and Exemplary in all holy Conversation. Such Persons are under GOD, the Strength and Safety of a People. Had there been <HI>ten Righteous</HI> in <HI>Sodom,</HI> GOD wou'd have spar'd it, <HI>Gen:</HI> 18.32. I hope there are many <HI>hundreds</HI> in in this Land. The Lord increase their Number, and pour out the Spirit of Grace and Supplication more abundantly upon them.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>LET our</HI> Young People <HI>Fear the Lord, and flee youthful Lusts.</HI></P>
<P>HERE is a loud Call to you, to <HI>Remember your Creator in the days of your Youth;</HI> for you lie as much expos'd to this threatned Judgment as the Aged, and can no more escape it. O turn at GOD's <HI>Re∣proos</HI> then, <HI>lest he laugh at your Galamity, and mock when your fear cometh,</HI> when your fear cometh as desolation — <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.26, 27. You are apt to pre∣sume of many days; but now GOD teacheth you that <HI>sudden 'Destruction</HI> may come upon you. Do you then hear and fear and turn to the Lord. Seek CHRIST early; Receive him without delay, <HI>That you may have power to become the Sons of GOD,</HI> Joh. 1.12. Then you may go to GOD as to your <HI>reconciled Father</HI> when in distress. But if you now despise the Son of GOD, and neglect his great Salva∣tion, there will be dreadful Reason to Fear, that GOD will utterly forsake you in the evil Day. Be intrea∣ted therefore, O <HI>young People,</HI> to consider of your
<PB N="22" REF="002954_0024_0FE6A4FCDB59E078"/>ways, and turn your feet to GOD's Testimonies. GOD in his Word and by his Providence speaks to you as, Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</HI> It is at your ut∣most Peril if you go on in the ways of Sin, after such loud Calls and fair Warnings. Now then, forsake the foolish and live; hearken to the Lord, that you may dwell safely, and be quiet from fear of Evil, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.33.</P>
<P>IN a word, <HI>LET us all be quicken'd to make ready for the Coming of our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WE learn from this <HI>surprising Providence</HI> that we know not how suddenly our Lord may come to us <HI>by Death,</HI> and call us to appear before Him. Let us not then be at rest till we can in some measure say with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts 21.13. <HI>I am ready to die.</HI> And who can tell how near the <HI>glorious Appearing</HI> of the SON OF GOD may be? <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are nam'd among the <HI>Signs</HI> of our <HI>Lord's Coming,</HI> Matth. 24.7.29, 30. <HI>Great Events</HI> have been attended with them; as our Saviour's <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> Matth. 27.51, 54. Upon which they said, <HI>Truly this was the Son of God.</HI> His <HI>Resurrection,</HI> Matth. 28.2. And are we not directed to expect terrible <HI>Convulsions in Na∣ture</HI> before our Lord's <HI>second Coming,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.10, 12. And that it will be very sudden and surprising to a secure World. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.36,—39. O let us then stand with our Loins girt, and Lamps burning, as they that wait for the Coming of the Lord! <HI>Let us be diligent that we may be found of our Judge in Peace, without spot &amp; blameless.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>LET us Cry to GOD to pour out his Spirit upon us,</HI> that we may Obey his Voice, and make an <HI>holy Improvement</HI> of this awful Dis∣pensation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002954_0025_0FE6A4FCF1C58BF0"/>
THE most extraordinary Means will be ineffectual without GOD's Blessing communicated by his Spirit. And surely, <HI>It is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteousness upon you,</HI> Hos. 10.12. We are undone without this; for we shall grow worse and worse under the most awakening Judgments, till we are ripe for Ruin. Let us then thirst after this comprehensive <HI>Blessing,</HI> and ask it of our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> who is ready to bestow it upon diligent Seekers, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. And let us offer up our Re∣quests to GOD in the <HI>Name</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath received the <HI>Promise of the Holy Ghost.</HI> We read, Acts 4.31. <HI>When they had prayed the Place was shaken where they were assem∣bled together: and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.</HI> O that this <HI>shaking</HI> we have felt might be follow'd with a plentiful Effusion of the Spirit, to convince us of our many heinous Transgressions, to Convert &amp; Reform us! This wou'd take away the ground of the Controversy, and give us good reason to expect all needed Salvation from the light of GOD's Countenance. Ezek. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the House of Israel, saith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>LET us bless GOD who hath not bro't upon us the Destruction we fear'd, but de∣liver'd us from going down to the Pit.</HI></P>
<P>THIS amazing Judgment hath in a great measure destroy'd other <HI>populous Towns.</HI> They have sunk under the weight of GOD's Anger, and been swallow'd up. When as we are shaken indeed and terrified; but without any great Damage. Let our Hearts then be deeply affected with this wonderful Deliverance, and our Mouths fill'd with the high Praises of the great GOD our Saviour. But let us not grow secure, as if the bitterness of Death was wholly past; for GOD can easily cause the Judgment to rise up again, and
<PB N="24" REF="002954_0026_0FE6A50190AB26A0"/>as an <HI>overslowing Scourge</HI> that shall bear down all before it, and make the Land desolate. O let not our Ingratitude under so distinguishing a Mercy, provoke Him; but let us render to the Lord accor∣ding to his Benefits.</P>
<P>USE, III. <HI>LET such as stand in Aw of GOD, Encourage themselves in him, and hope in his Mercy.</HI> Psal. 147.11. <HI>The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</HI> You that dread GOD's displeasure, and fly from Sin as the worst of Evils, shou'd fear nothing with amazement; but shou'd have your <HI>hearts fixed trusting in the Lord,</HI> Isa. 41.10. <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</HI> GOD is your <HI>Father;</HI> and your <HI>Redeemer</HI> is mighty, having all Power in Heaven &amp; Earth. Do you therefore receive and obey that Command, Joh. 14.1. <HI>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</HI> Trust and Rejoice in CHRIST JESUS, who saves to the uttermost. Depend on his watchful powerful Provi∣dence, who is the Head over all things to the Church. And then, Let your Hearts be in tune, to sing the 46th Psal. <HI>God is our refuge &amp; strength, a very pre∣sent help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be car∣ried into the midst of the sea.</HI> For GOD will help you, and that right early. You that fear the Lord shou'd <HI>Trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon your God,</HI> Isa. 50.10. Even in your darkest Hours; for he is a present help in Trouble. Thus you may Live in holy Security &amp; Peace, without being tor∣mented with anxious Cares &amp; Fears, and may say with the Psalmist, Psal. 4.8. <HI>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safety.</HI></P>
