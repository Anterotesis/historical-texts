<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the writing the following discourse and prayer, the publisher has been greatly solicited by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</P>
<P>Therefore in pursuance to the repeated requests that has been made, the publisher hath made use of the press to convey the same to the public with hopes it may be useful to some and that no disad∣vantage will ensue to any individual.</P>
<P>The publishing of good books hath oftentimes been of great service, nay, hath been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the luke∣warm.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following discourse will be attended with the same power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which caused them to flow forth</P>
<P>It is not the province of the editor to say much or to multiply words, but hopes the ensuing dis∣course and prayer may be read with a solid and sober mind.</P>
<P>It is the indispensable duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden vessels (holy
<PB N="4" REF="026895_0003_0FD24B90AEB6A610"/>
words) of the Lord's house, and see that they profane not the temple of God with unhallowed tongues.</P>
<P>I therefore shall leave the issue to the all-wise dis∣poser of all good things.</P>
<P>The publisher having not seen the author of the fol∣lowing discourse, since she delivered it, the public cannot expect to have her approbation for publish∣ing the same; but he hath shewn it to many who were present at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the substance of what they heard.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">(These words being most insisted on in the foregoing part of the discourse, the editor hath thought proper to prefix the same.)</HEAD>
<P>IF I mistake not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, both he and his disciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he graciously pleased to honour with his heavenly pre∣sence; and even there manifested himself by his omnipotent and divine power, in a most wonderful and miraculous man∣ner.</P>
<P>Since my sitting down here amongst you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, without the least study or premeditation. I could not be silent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the divine will; for I desired not the sound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apostle and servant of our Lord did, to whom a dis∣pensation of the gospel was commited; who said, <HI>Woe be unto me if I preach not the gospel!</HI> I heartily wish, and it is the earnest desire of my mind, that those that are now concerned, may be solicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of eve∣ry individual, that is here present, to invite this heavenly guest, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly pre∣sence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus solicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great reason to expect his gracious presence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promised, saying; <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and bless them.
<PB N="6" REF="026895_0005_0FD24B95F0D45208"/>
Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name</HI> (that is, my power) <HI>there will I be in the midst of them, and I will bless them.</HI> What wonderful condescension is this to his children and people, to be so highly favoured with his heavenly prefence!</P>
<P>In this he fulfils his promise which he hath made to his disciples, as he expresses himself in another place, saying <HI>I and my Father will come and sup with them, and we will make our abode with them.</HI> O! blessed inhabitant, and heavenly guest! O! that it may be the happy experience of the present parties here concerned, and that they may be favoured with the heavenly manifestation of divine love, that they may witness his stupendous power to visit, pre∣serve, guide and direct them!</P>
<P>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may be all a watching and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is strength in weakness and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his hea∣venly teaching, which is found to them that seek him, as he himself hath graciously promised who said, <HI>He that seeketh me, shall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast off.</HI> Here our blessed Lord sheweth his unspeak∣able love to the sons and daughters of men, to be thus gra∣ciously visited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the solicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxi∣ous to hear what may be spoken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and experience thy divine will. This was the short prayer of my spirit since my sitting down among you. I heartily wish it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we should have cause to rejoice in our coming together: and it would do our souls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to seek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us; and have the happy ex∣perience
<PB N="7" REF="026895_0006_0FD24B974D8E0FF0"/>
to witness his power, and taste of his blessing. By this experience we shall come to know his heavenly power to preserve, and his divine instruction to teach us, who speaks as never man spoke, who is the Wonderful Counsellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everlasting Father, and of the increase of his government there shall never be an end.</P>
<P>Now what great advantage would this be to the children of men, to know and witness this great power to rule and reign in them, whose right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and direct us in his ways.</P>
<P>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly instructions, we shall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to be done in us as it is in heaven; and have that excellent prayer of our Lord an∣swered; <HI>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as is done in heaven.</HI> O! what an excellent and heavenly expe∣rience it is to have the mind resigned to the will of our heavenly father! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what sweet tranquility of mind do they possess where the kingdom of God is come? where righteousness and peace is known? and where the Lord Jesus rules and reigns?</P>
<P>It was observed before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his presence, they had a watch. The servants that attended, were to watch and obey the orders given them, which was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon the Lord: by their waiting and watching they come to know the Lord's will, and obey his orders.</P>
<P>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expression to the servants that attended? It was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids do, that do.</HI> And we may re∣member they were ordered to put water into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they
<PB N="8" REF="026895_0007_0FD24B99EFB420B0"/>
waited for the divine command. Here our Lord shewed his miraculous power. Here it was our Blessed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the servants that waited to hand it forth. Observe. The water was first made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not be∣fore the servants had to hand it to the company that was present. How gracious was our Lord, how great was his power, in shewing forth this miracle? I could not but ad∣mire his great love and wonderful condescension to man∣kind!</P>
<P>Now, let us observe the expression in the orders given, which was, <HI>Whatsoever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And he di∣rected the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the feast, that he might taste it; and he tasted it, and those that were at the marriage. What was then expressed? It was <HI>The last wine is the best.</HI> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and condescension of our dear Lord, in bestowing his gifts to his children and people; how he manifested his power amongst them; and how condescending he is to those who are anxious to know the water being made wine, that the spirits of the contrite might be revived, and those that are ready to faint might be refreshed by the handing forth of divine love, which is the wine of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is strenth in weakness and riches in poverty. Our own strength as men and creatures, is as water, be our educa∣cation ever so high, and our wisdom but foolishness. It is like water and not wine, be it ever so excellent, till taught of the Lord by his inspeaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the same that it ever was, that those who are truly concerned, come to know and witness a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly sought after, that all those that are here present may be solicitous to hear his voice, which speaketh as never man spoke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and hea∣venly instruction: that they may taste of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his servants to hand it forth to the people, they may have it to say (from a true and real experience,) <HI>The last wine is the best.</HI> This has been the concern of my spirit among you, that you may wit∣ness his power to be with you, and in the midst of you. It is
<PB N="9" REF="026895_0008_0FD24B99F4BCBF68"/>
his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</P>
<P>I have sometimes thought the Lord is wonderfully mani∣festing his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cause of the water being made wine, not those that hand it forth. If he doth not prepare it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not order it to be given, it is but water and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality that can satisfy those that are seeking the Lord for divine help and strength. This has been upon my mind as I have been engaged a∣mongst you: and I think it was in some degree a miracle.</P>
<P>I do not want to monopolize other persons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more wil∣ling to hear than to speak; but, methinks when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine blessing, in order that the guests which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord prepares it himself. He is inviting his children to come and refresh themselves with the wine of his king∣dom. O, if people did but see, if their minds were right∣ly concerned; and if there was but a true seeking to him, there would be a tasting of the wine of his preparing.</P>
<P>O that the eye of the mind was but single to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the father is well plea∣sed, who said, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!</HI> It is my sincere desire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his heavenly voice, that you may come to be acquainted with him, and obey his voice that is the true Minister of the Sanctuary and Bishop of his Church and People, whom God the Father sends, is the earnest prayer of my spirit.</P>
<P>Now, if the eye were single to him, and our expectations from him, and not from the arm of flesh; we should know the Lord Jesus, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I say, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet spake of, saying. <HI>A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up, like unto me. Him shall you hear in all things; and he that doth not hear him, shall be cut off from among his people.</HI> If we did but hear and obey God, we should come to know his power to be amongst us. O that there may be a trusting in the Lord, and a dependance on his spirit and power to teach and instruct us, is the earnest concern
<PB N="10" REF="026895_0009_0FD24B9B0F7F7FB0"/>
of my mind. Is is he that speaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>As we come to be divested of Self, as there is no leaning on our own understanding, [<HI>Lean not to your own understand∣ing, but trust in the Lord</HI> (said an eminent servant of God) <HI>trust in the Lord, and he will help thee</HI>] not to lean on words nor the acquired arts and parts of the creature, be them ever so high and excellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect resignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that seek him shall find him: the humble he will teach his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and those that thirst after righteousness he will fill with his heavenly wine.</P>
<P>But O Friends! there must be a watchfulness and a care not to lean on our own understanding, or on our own cogi∣tations, that is so apt to fill the mind. If we come to expe∣rience this, O how shall we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>It is the true and humble seeking soul shall be blessed of the Lord, and those that hunger and thirst after righteous∣ness; it is they and they only, that shall obtain the pro∣mise, <HI>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</HI> but the rich and full they shall be sent empty away. Those that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are those that shall be sent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the strength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all beings and principalities, both in Heaven and Earth. Blessed be the God of truth! It is He that teach∣eth the people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with himself. It is by the manifestation of Christ Jesus the truth is come to be known, as he himself hath expressed, saying, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given amongst men, but the name of Christ, whereby mankind can be saved.</HI></P>
<P>It is Christ Jesus, which is Life and Truth, that would raise us from sin and death to a life of righteousness. If there was but a seeking to him, and a desire to be taught by him, what advantage would we then receive! Our sorrow would be then turned into joy, and our weakness
<PB N="11" REF="026895_0010_0FD24B9C8CB73408"/>
into strength; we should then come to know the promise of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and strength in all our weakness. All those that do put their trust in him, and have an eye single to him, that are solicitous for his divine instruction, and seek him with all their whole heart, who seeks the doctrine from his mouth, shall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be single to him, thy whole body shall be full of light; that is, if thou art singly looking to God, and to his divine appearance in thine own heart, thou shalt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be known of God, is made manifest in man. (This is scripture doctrine.) It is there he is manifesting and revealing himself against sin and wickedness, and against every evil way.</P>
<P>He that maketh manifest is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; thou shalt see what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone. In him there is no confusion, but the confusion is in the creature, for want of singly looking to God; and this want is the cause of the want of a true devotion to, and worshipping God aright, who is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth; for such doth the father seek to worship him. There must be no dependance on flesh and blood; for flesh and blood shall never enter into heaven. The apostle Paul conferred not with flesh and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly vision, to the instruction of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, as himself hath said. <HI>I conferred not</HI> (said he) <HI>with flesh and blood, but straightway gave up to the heavenly vision.</HI> He did not receive the gospel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Observe how bold he speaks his own expe∣rience, <HI>I conferred not with flesh and blood. I received it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Christ Jesus, the heavenly instructor; who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was given to the apostle just mentioned, to preach Christ Jesus to the Jews as well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a stumbling-block and to the Gentiles foolishness. It was by obedience and a resignation
<PB N="12" REF="026895_0011_0FD24BA4F1BABA68"/>
to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an ex∣cellent instrument in the hand of God, to discourage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteousness; for it is the Righteous, my friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a shame to any people. This is instruction to mankind. This is what the Apostle of our blessed Lord had to distri∣bute. It was the great business his Master sent him to do, to preach righteousness and discourage immorality, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteousness (which ex∣alteth a nation) be established. This was the end for which Christ came into the world, and was prophesied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to sin and finish transgression, and in the room there∣of to establish everlasting righteousness.</P>
<P>Now, if ever the work of righteousness is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it must be begun at home, in our own hearts; for (observe) Christ came to take away sin, and in the room thereof to establish ever∣lasting righteousness. We may also take notice of another expression of an eminent servant of our blessed Lord, that God <HI>so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</HI>— (what for?)—<HI>to take away sin, in order that he might redeem to himself a peculiar and holy people, zealous of good works.</HI> How can we but be concerned that the glorious end for which Christ came, might be answered; that sin, which is a shame, might be put an end to, and transgression finished, that righteousness which exalteth a nation be established.</P>
<P>If we were truly sincere, if we were true ministers of Jesus Christ, how anxious would we be, how zealously would we labour, that sin might be put an end to, and transgression finished! There is no room left for sin, nor place for transgression; but the Lord directs to righteous∣ness, and without holiness no man shall see the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold ini∣quity with approbation. There is no people that are so beloved of the Lord, that he can approve of sin in them. It is not forms or modes of religion, or a formal righte∣ousness, nor the inventions of men will do; but it is through obedience and sanctification we are made righte∣ous; and by being washed with the water of regeneration we come to be cleansed from sin and pollution.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="026895_0012_0FD24BA744611030"/>If we come to be beloved of the Lord, it must be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his hea∣venly will. It is the obedient soul shall live. It is he that shall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All those that do his will shall know of his doctrine. It is they that shall be taught of the Lord, as our dear Lord said, <HI>He that doeth my will shall know of my doctrine.</HI> O may there be a real concern in every heart, and an earnest desire raised in each of our minds, that sin may be put an end to, and transgression finished! If we were solicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and strength would be put into our minds, that everlasting righteousness might be brought in, and the kingdom of Christ be established.</P>
<P>If we were true Christians taught of the Lord, and so∣licitous for his honour, we should be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and will∣ing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his cross, and draw our inclinations to himself. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</HI> saith the Scripture of truth. Here is a beautiful comparison. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his cross, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become serviceable in the creation, and useful to one another; for he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glorify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind since I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of in∣struction, which is the way to life, and become obedient to the voice of wisdom, which is calling them in the secret of their hearts. The Lord in his mercy, is calling unto the sons and daughters of men; he is calling them from dark∣ness to light, from the power of sin and Satan to serve the living God. I cannot but admire his unspeakable love and wonderful mercy that he bestows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can shut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can shut, and shutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a comply∣ing,
<PB N="14" REF="026895_0013_0FD24BA88AB13A78"/>
if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteous∣ness, the door of mercy will be shut. This is plainly set forth in the parable of the virgins.</P>
<P>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came, the foolish virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they said unto the wise, <HI>Give us of your oil.</HI> What was the answer of the wise? It was a very reasonable one,—<HI>Not so, lest there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for yourselves. And when they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was shut;</HI> and an answer was made to the foolish virgins, when they wanted to enter, <HI>I know you not.</HI> A dismal sentence it was, and will be pronounced to the wicked,—<HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI> I hope that this may never be the case of any that are here. The foolish had a name to virgins as well as the wise; but that would no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> get them an entrance. Though they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the answer, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Observe: Here was both a name and profession to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the foolish wanted oil: they wanted righteousness. The time was elapsed; the door of mercy was shut; an answer was made; and a woeful sentence pronounced,— <HI>Depart from me▪ I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard of him that speaketh as never man spoke, who speaketh in the secret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his house upon the sand. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell, because it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with those who trust to a name of religion, and a formal righteousness, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earnestly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy bless you and keep you: may his infinite power preserve and protect you!</P>
<P>But he that built his house on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not, because it was built upon a rock; so will he stand who builds on the divine rock, Christ Jesus the Son of God, and sure foundation. Against him the gates of Hell shall never prevail. The floods may come and the winds may blow, and waves of temptation may raise themselves high,
<PB N="15" REF="026895_0014_0FD24BAA02ED4098"/>
he shall stand in the day of trial, because he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</P>
<P>Therefore let none deceive themselves, for <HI>such as you sow, such shall you reap.</HI> If you sow to the spirit, you shall of the spirit reap life everlasting; but if you sow to the flesh, a miserable crop shall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteousness wrought in us we come to taste of the blessing; and <HI>O that it may be the case!</HI> is the earnest pray∣er that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppose I should say it hath attended me here, for which my soul doth bless the Lord, who hath come down to his people, and is making his power known in blessing the pro∣vision of Zion. We cannot but worship at the throne of his footstool, who is God over all, blessed in himself. He only is worthy to be adored, honoured and obeyed, not only now, but now, henceforth and for ever more. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>BE pleased, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemorate thy goodness. We are made to admire, in a sense of our own nothingness, and say <HI>O</HI> Lord! <HI>what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the sons of men that thou thus visitest them!</HI> Thy children that love thee in their hearts, prevail, under the influence of thy heavenly power, and are made willing to follow thee, and feel after thee, thou Lord God that changest not. Thou art a God, slow to anger, a God of wonderful love and unspeakable kindness. Thy truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to beseech thee, in behalf of mankind all the world over (let their names or profession be what it may) that thousands or tens of thousands may be brought home by thy Son; and that thou wouldst make thyself known by manifesting thyself to them. Be pleased to re∣member, in mercy, those that have much thought of thy name, and also those that have not enquired after thee; that by and through the discovery of thy light, O Lord God of Truth, they may come to see thy sacred truth, and be made to follow thee wheresoever thou goest, that thy name, which is holy, may be glorified. Holy Lord God, as we have known thy infinite mercy to be with us, O be thou pleased, once more to reach unto the hearts of such as rebel against thee. It's thy power alone can effect it. It is the sanctifying by thy divine power, thy inspeak∣ing word, that can reach every heart, that can turn them from the evil of their ways, to serve and obey thee, the Living God, that they may know a sacrificing to thy dear

Son, and to Thee, O Lord God. Be pleased to give them an humble repentance, that they may know thee, O Lord, to be a God of mercy. O Lord, remember the poor in heart, we humbly beseech thee, even those whose knees are ready to smite together, that have no might or strength of their own, and who are ready to perish. All such as rebel against thee, turn thou, O God, their minds to thee. Thou, O God, art known in thy own temple the heart. It is there only that thou art to be felt and worshipped. Prepare many there, yea, many thousands, that they may taste of thy goodness, and hear the voice of thy High Priest, who speaks as never man spoke. In a sense that thou art a God that changest not, and that it is therefore the sons of men are not consumed: in a sense of thy goodness and mercy, we humbly present ourselves before thee, and be∣seech thee that many may come to know and praise thy great name, who alone is worthy to be praised, adored, and mag∣nified, with thy dear Son immaculate, and holy Spirit for evermore. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SOME ACCOUNT OF</HI> ISAAC SHOEMAKER, <HI>OF THE</HI> Township of Cheltenham, in the County of Philadelphia (Son of <HI>JOHN SHOEMAKER</HI> of the same Place) who departed this Life on the <HI>31</HI>st Day of the seventh Month <HI>1779,</HI> in the twenty fifth Year of his Age.</HEAD>
<P>HE was a young man of an active disposition and vigourous constitution, who in the general tenor of his conduct and conversation was preserved from what in the world's estimati∣on is accounted gross or immoral; yet in his company, dress and deportment evidence a leaning to levity, and fond∣ness for things in their nature vain and unsubstantial; of the emptiness and corrupting tendency whereof he was at time made sensible, by the faithful admonitions of the Divine Mo∣nitor in his own mind, as appears from some of his expressions near his departure out of time; when through the renewed extendings of heavenly favour, he was mercifully visited and awakened from a state of insensibility; under the quickening influences whereof, he had to warn and admonish his former associates and others, against indulging themselves in the va∣nities and folies of a perishing world; some of whom having been measureably reached thereby, have signified a desire that the weighty expressions uttered by him in that solemn sea∣son, might be communicated and diffused for the benefit of the youth of his acquaintance and others; which if weighed with becoming seriousness and depth of attention, might minister profitable instruction, and tend to lasting edification. This instance of heavenly condescention and divine regard affording renewed cause in humble admiration to say,
<Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty! just and true are thy ways thou King of Saints!
<BIBL>Rev. xv. 3.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="026895_0018_0FD24BB4C7C1FE10"/>About ten days before his decease, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening he fell into a state of silence, and became speechless and incapable of bodily action, his mouth being open and his jaw set: thus he lay nearly three hours, supposed by the family and divers of the neighbours present, to be in a trance. Upon his recovery, he ground his teeth together, so as greatly to affect the hearers, and twice or thrice sighed deeply. After which, appearing like one raised from the dead, under great concern and exercise of mind, he began to speak with a strong voice, to the astonishment of those in company; saying,
<Q>Oh! that I could tell you what I have seen and underwent. It would pierce the hardest heart amongst you; perhaps some may think there is no hell, but I have to tell you there is a hell, and a dreadful one too; and the grinding of my teeth is nothing to the grinding and gnashing of teeth in hell. And there is a heaven and a sweet one too; where angels cloathed in white robes sit at the right hand of God singing praises to his great name; I have to declare it unto you at the peril of my soul, but some will not believe though an apostle should rise from the dead. You may think I am not in my senses, but I knew you all as you came into the room, am perfectly in my senses, and God hath opened my mouth on your account, and that you might declare it unto others. Narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are going in that way.</Q>
(Proceeding in a bemoaning accent.)
<Q>I have lived to this age without knowing what God real∣ly is, until this night. I have been often visited, but did kick and rebel. Three years ago, I had a sight that I should be brought to the brink of the grave, but it was not shewn me whether I should recover or not; but if I do, I am desirous that I might be made an instrument to convert thousands into the right way. I wonder (con∣tinued he) that I should undertake to be the head of a family and not capable to teach them their duty towards God: there is a necessity for parents and heads of fami∣lies to bring up their children and others under their care, in plainness of speech and apparel, keeping humble, en∣deavouring to impress their tender minds with a sense of their duty towards God. Many let their children run about the streets, hearing (which is often used in this land) the holy name of Jesus taken in vain. My parents
<PB N="3" REF="026895_0019_0FD24BB9807D55F0"/>
when I was young, were drawn so much into the cumber∣ing things of this world, that they did not teach me as they ought to have done my duty towards God.</Q>
To his wife he uttered himself thus:
<Q>My dear consort, my bosom friend, mourn not for me, there are many diffi∣culties and trials to be met with in our passing through this world; retire to thy father's house, live a sober, virtuous life. If it should please God to take me out of the world this night, I would have none to take it to heart; no, not to shed a tear.</Q>
He was divers times drawn forth in fervent supplication, and expressed himself
on this wise:<Q> Oh! Lord Jesus, be pleased to look down with an eye of pity upon me; on my father, be with him and comfort him in his old age, under the afflic∣tions and trials that may be suffered to come upon him▪ On my aged mother, be her strength and support all the days of her life; who has been a kind and tender mother to me, all my days; and hath since my sickness, in my distress, pointed out the right path for me to turn into, when I was ready to fall into despair, under a sense of my manifold transgressions, directing me to look forward towards my dear Redeemer, whose blood is sufficient to wash away all our sins, which I have experienced the truth of. Be pleased, if it be thy will, look down upon mankind universally, reconcile all men to one another and to thyself, that there may be no more blood spilt in the land, if it be thy blessed will; not my will, but thine be done.</Q>
Also singing praises to God for his many great mercies to him.</P>
<P>Being desirous of seeing divers of his acquaintance not present, he said:
<Q>They know not what God really is; some of them have in their breasts the spirit of envy and bitterness.</Q>
Under much concern that they may be re∣deemed from that wrathful spirit, he earnestly besought the Almighty to turn their hearts to love and good will.
<Q>I wonder, (said he) that God hath not sent his just judg∣ments and destroyed this place, for wickedness and hard∣ness of heart.</Q>
He desired to be made subject to the divine will, and said,
<Q>I have no will of my own, not my will but thine be done.</Q> To his brothers he said, <Q>Remem¦ber your Creator in the days of your youth, dress plain and walk humble before the Lord; never mind what your comrades say▪ for we must all become fools for Christ's
<PB N="4" REF="026895_0020_0FD24BBC0C7C1F08"/>
sake, that we may be made wise. Make Him your stand∣ard, keep the world under your feet; attend meetings with your father and mother both on first and other days of the week; when met, turn your minds inward and solidly think what you came about, and endeavour to know God for yourselves; do not as I have done; I of∣ten went to meetings and sometimes did think on those things, but soon let them slip, letting my mind out at fine cloaths and gay dress, contriving how to exceed in grandeur.</Q>
To his apprentice boy he said,
<Q>I have heard thee use many idle words and passed it by without proper notice, I beg thee may break thyself of them, or God will pronounce his judgments against thee.</Q>
desiring the company to withdraw out of the room and to be left alone in stillness, he said,
<Q>I think I have done with flesh, I have said all that I have to say unto you;</Q> then lifting too his hands he said, <Q>Oh! holy Jesus how sweet do I feel thee!</Q>
All being gone out of the room, he devout∣ly and loudly desired (in the hearing of some friends in the adjoining room) that God might be pleased to stop the ef∣fusion of blood.</P>
<P>After which he appeared like one whose mind is redeemed from the earth and much swallowed up in a sense of that sweetness he had been so marvellously favoured with; con∣tinuing in this frame of spirit to the close of his time; and we doubt not but he now rests in peace and quiet with the Lord.</P>

<HEAD>The following POSTSCRIPT relating to the Doctrine of the resurrection and eternal Judgment, in <HI>WM. SEW∣ELL</HI>'s History, may be a seasonable addition to the foregoing Narrative.</HEAD>
<P>'AT the last trump of God, and voice of the Archan∣gel, the dead shall be raised incorruptible, the dead in Christ shall raise first. 1 Cor. xv. 52. 1 Thes. iv. 16 compared with Matt. xxiv. 31.'</P>
<P>'Many are often alarmed in conscience hereby the word and voice of God, who stop the ears and slight those warn∣ings; but the great and final alarm of the last trumpet they cannot stop their ears against, nor escape it. It will unavoida∣bly seize upon and further waken them finally to judgment: They that will not be alarmed in their consciences unto re∣pentances, nor out of their sins here, must certainly be a∣larmed to judgment hereafter.'</P>
<P>'Whosoever do now willfully shut their eyes, hate con∣temn or shun the light of Christ, or his appearance within, shall at last be made to see, and not be able to shun or hide themselves from his glorious and dreadful appearance from heaven with his mighty angels, as with lightning and in flaming fire, to render vengeance on all them that know not God, and obey not this Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thes. iv. 17. Matt. xxiv. 17. Luke xvii. 24. Dan. xix 6. Job. xxxvii, 3.'</P>
<P>'And tho' many now evade and reject the inward con∣victions and judgments of the light, and shut up the records or books thereof in their own consciences, they shall all be at last opened, and every one judged of these things record∣ed therein and according to their works. Rev. xx. 12, 13.14.15.'</P>
