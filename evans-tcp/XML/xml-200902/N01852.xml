<HEAD>A PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>Containing some Animadversions upon the <HI>Praeface</HI> to the <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Was the other Day very much sur∣prized to meet with a small Pam∣phlet, wearing this specious and very promising Title; <HI>Choice Dialogues, between a Godly Minister, and an honest Countrey-Man, concerning Election and Predestination,</HI> &amp;c. Both the <HI>Sublimity</HI> of the Subject, no less than the <HI>Secret and Eternal Decrees</HI> of the Deity, a very abstruse Theme; as also the <HI>Choice∣ness</HI> of the promised Dialogues, raised my Expectations to a very great Pitch. <HI>But</HI> upon the Perusal of them; I soon found the Author laid himself open to the Censures which <HI>Horace</HI> tells us they are liable to fall under, who promise more than they can per∣form, and fill the Reader up with vain Hopes, only to tantalize and baulk him in his Ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>Amphora caepit

<LG>
<L>Which suffer me to English after this manner.</L>
<L><HI>Since you began with so much Pomp and Show</HI></L>
<L><HI>How is it, Man, the End's so vile and low?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Prithee, what wilt thou bring worth all this Rout and Touse?</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Mountain groans in Travail, and brings forth a Mouse.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>In the first place, as is natural to every Reader, who desires to be informed of the <HI>Occasion, Design, and Scope</HI> of any Work, I dipped into the <HI>Preface to the Reader,</HI> hoping there to find some special and weighty Reasons, which urged the <HI>Editor</HI> to publish these Controversial and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igious Dialogues. <HI>Editor,</HI> I say; for it is hard to know whe∣ther <HI>he,</HI> or his <HI>Aged Divine</HI> wrote them, or rather by a Juggle they brought forth the Mungril between them. He says, it was written by <HI>a Reverend and Laborious Pas∣tor in Christ's Flock, by one who has been for almost twice thirty years, a faithful and painful Labourer in Christ's Vineyard.</HI> I believe I know the <HI>Reverend and Laborious Pastor</HI> he means, <HI>viz.</HI> a cer∣tain <HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy-man, who, I dare vouch
<PB N="iii" REF="002194_0005_0FDAC8A9200C6050"/>has Served the <HI>Pretender ten</HI> years, where he has the Flock of Christ <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>But to return, I could not for my Life find any weighty Reason for his Publishing these <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI> I began to think, It might be, that some of the Young Strip∣plings had roared <HI>Predestination</HI> out of the Pulpits; but with all my inquisitive Search∣es could not find it so. I then began to recol∣lect my self, and as my <HI>Young Logic</HI> taught me, began to <HI>compare, compound and di∣vide Ideas,</HI> but could not with all my Wits see the <HI>Connection</HI> of the <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>[Young Stripling]</HI> and <HI>[Predestination]</HI> or ima∣gine how a Discourse upon the <HI>awful and secret Decrees</HI> of God naturally led a Man to rail at a <HI>Young Presbyterian.</HI> And re∣ally I never met with such an Oddity and Inconsistency, as to fill a Book with Calumnies and Reproaches, which is written out of <HI>Charity to the Souls of Men. Full of Charity,</HI> brim full of it! and yet through∣out the whole Book transgressing the Rules of that excellent Grace, which the Apostle says, <HI>1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it self, is not puf∣fed up; doth not behave it self unseem∣ly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth; beareth all things, believeth all
<PB N="iv" REF="002194_0006_0FDAC8AA92B07450"/>Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</HI> But his high-flying bitter Spirit savours of too much Rancor, to let the World think, that Love to Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and not Hatred to the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> was the Spring and Motive of his underta∣king this scurrilous Work.</P>
<P><HI>As for the Dialogues themselves,</HI> says he, <HI>they contain a rich and precious store of Spiritual Knowledge, and Godly Com∣fort.</HI> So the Prefacer thinks. But others are not of his Mind. Why are you angry, Sir? Won't you suffer us <HI>conscientiously to dissent from you?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, but stop <HI>Young Stripling! they speak to the Hearts of Men in a very easie and familiar Manner, so that the meanest Plough-man, the very meanest of God's People may understand them.</HI> Right, my Friend, no Body disputes but the meanest Plough-man may dive to the profound Bottom of them The <HI>Dialogues</HI> we give in the am∣plest Testimony you can desire, they are <HI>plain enough;</HI> but is the Subject you write of made as <HI>plain?</HI> No Body despairs that ever I heard of, of penetrating into your deepest Re∣cesses, by a single Glance. That ever the Man should be afraid, the World will deny reading his Book, for fear it should be too <HI>deep</HI> for them! No, Sir, your <HI>Dialogues</HI> are easie and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hallow enough; but <HI>Predestination</HI> is as great
<PB N="v" REF="002194_0007_0FDAC8AC18DE16C0"/>a <HI>Mystery</HI> as ever: and I never thought that which the great Doctor of the Gentiles, the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> adores as <HI>unsearchable,</HI> could be brought down level with the Capacity of a <HI>Plough man;</HI> or that a <HI>Plough-Man</HI> can so easily comprehend and understand the Decrees, and ascend in a few Hours, those eternal Mountains of Brass, which have always been inaccessible by the most towring and exalted <HI>Genius</HI>'s. To hear <HI>Paul</HI> with an <HI>[O Altitu∣do]</HI> in his Mouth; and a <HI>Plough-Man</HI> calling out, here St. <HI>Paul,</HI> I'll let you into the <HI>Mystery;</HI> there is no Difficulty in the Mat∣ter. <HI>Lesly</HI> shall explain it you in a Minute. <HI>Paul! Lesley</HI> will set you to rights, and bring you to understand your own <HI>Mysterious</HI> Wri∣tings.</P>
<P><HI>They treat of that deep, but comfortable Doctrine, I mean the Doctrine of Election and Predestination.</HI> But then the Author limits his Meaning in a long <HI>Parenthesis, (that Soul-piercing Doctrine to the Wick∣ed and Unregenerate, but Soul-refreshing, &amp; Heart-comforting Doctrine to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk.)</HI> Then it seems, it is a <HI>Soul-piercing</HI> Doctrine to the wicked and unregenerate. It would be too Sa∣tyrical and hard to argue the Author's <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI> State and Character, from its being such a <HI>Soul-piercing</HI> Doctrire to <HI>him,</HI> that he can∣not so much as endure the Sound of <HI>Fore-or∣daining, Fore-kowledge, Pre-destination;</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="002194_0008_0FDACA369BC010A0"/>must have substituted in the Room of these <HI>Heart-piercing</HI> Words, <HI>Destination, Know∣ledge, Ordaining.</HI> O what a killing syllable is <HI>[Pre]</HI> A Man had much better be <HI>destined</HI> to Hell, than <HI>predestined,</HI> &amp; had rather be <HI>known</HI> of God an Heir of Damnation, than be <HI>foreknown</HI> to be so.</P>
<P><HI>Now as to the Occasion of the Publication of these Dialogue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Alas, Christian! I fear there is too too great Occasion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em. The many pernicious (and I fear al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s!) Soul destroying Books, &amp;c.</HI> Here I must ask the Author's Pardon, when I said I could not find any Reason of his for the Publication of these Dialogues. No, here's a Reason, our Author perceives there are <HI>pernicious and Soul-de∣stroying Books</HI> handed up and down the Country. But he mentions none of them, either by their Titles or in a way of Quotation; nor do I think any Number of Tractates <HI>of Predesti∣nation</HI> (which is what the Author must mean when he calls them <HI>pernicious and Soul-de∣stroying Books)</HI> have been handed up and down. Ʋpon all the Enquiries I have purposely made even since these CHOICE <HI>Dialogues</HI> came out, I can hear of no such Thing. Which makes me believe, the Prefacer had a mind to rail, and could find no way to introduce himself upon the Stage, but raking up an old Story of <HI>Predestina∣tion.</HI> I am sure, I never found but the Country was as silent, and as disengaged from any such Talk, as they are of the <HI>Millennium,</HI> or the next
<PB N="vii" REF="002194_0009_0FDACA381E026368"/><HI>blazing Star,</HI> that is to appear. And I am so much the more confirmed in my Opinion, in that the Prefacer without any Distinction, falls foul of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Clergy, especially the <HI>younger Sort,</HI> charging them home with Ca∣lumny and Slander. Instead of intreating and inviting us to the Truth; what vile Reproaches and malicious Invectives is his <HI>Preface</HI> filled with against those, who never did him any wrong in the World. Ʋnder the Ʋmbrage of <HI>Pre∣destination,</HI> he takes Liberty to be as unmannerly and reproachful as he pleases, till at lengeth one is almost stunned with the Noise and Din of his clamorous, ungenteel and scurrilous <HI>Rhapsodies.</HI></P>
<P>But it were endless as well as needless to take Notice of all his Cant and Jargon. He says, <HI>these Dialogues will rightly instruct Men concerning the true Scripture Doctrines of Election and Predestination.</HI> So the Au∣thor thinks, because tis done <HI>ad Captum;</HI> else it might be <HI>too laborious a Research</HI> for us. But we'll leave him in a good Conceit of his Piece, until we have gotten to the End of his learned Preface.</P>
<P>Yes, but they are <HI>Heart-enlightning Dia∣logues.</HI> How is the <HI>Bible</HI> then the <HI>Best of Books,</HI> since these <HI>Dialogues</HI> may lay claim to that <HI>incommunicable</HI> Character of that <HI>Blessed Book,</HI> viz. <HI>Heart-enlightning?</HI> See Psalm <HI>19.7, 8. Psalm 119.50.</HI> What is the Diffe∣rence between a <HI>converting, quickening,</HI> &amp;c. and an <HI>Heart-enlightening</HI> Dialogue? Strange
<PB N="viii" REF="002194_0010_0FDACA39F134CD40"/><HI>Dialogues!</HI> that above all <HI>Objective Illumi∣nation</HI> of the Ʋnderstanding, have a Power to reach the very <HI>Heart.</HI> A very powerful Word indeed: — But I forbear to fix any Consequen∣ces upon the Author, which he it may be ne∣ver intended himself, when he asserted these <HI>Dialogues</HI> to be <HI>Heart-enlightening;</HI> and shall only observe he is more charmed with them than others are, to think them so <HI>Divine,</HI> when <HI>humane Frailty</HI> betrays it self throughout almost the whole Composure. But should I fix such <HI>Consequences</HI> upon him, it would never equal his <HI>Impudence</HI> in insinuating that we <HI>worship the Devil. Vid. Pag. 2. Dial.</HI></P>
<P>Our Praefacer launches still further and deep∣er into the Elogies and Praises of these <HI>Heart∣enlightening Dialogues;</HI> says he, <HI>They will shew thee, what was the Opinion of the holy Martyrs of the Church in the first and purest Ages of Christianity, concerning these Doctrines. And O I am sure we ought to follow them, them, I say, who were taught the Faith of Christ from the Mouths of the Apostles or Apostolick Men,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>rather than hearken to—that great Antichrist,</HI> &amp;c. Were these brave Men he talks of <HI>Martyrs</HI> for opposing <HI>Calvin's</HI> Doct∣rine of <HI>Praedestination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Was the Doctrine contained in his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> the Truths for which they <HI>Dyed Martyrs, and Sealed with their Blood?</HI> Nay can he prove that these <HI>Ancient Fathers</HI> were of <HI>other</HI> Senti∣ment;
<PB N="ix" REF="002194_0011_0FDACA3B18375358"/>than we upon the Head of <HI>Election?</HI> I am sure the <HI>Dialogues</HI> don't prove it. No, Mr. <HI>Lesly</HI> says, this is the <HI>ancient Apostolic</HI> Doctrine, but not one <HI>ancient Father</HI> quoted to his Purpose. But since our Praefacer has <HI>none</HI> of their Proofs on his side, we will by and by give him a few.</P>
<P>These great and glorious <HI>Martyrs,</HI> the <HI>Quin∣tessence</HI> of whose Faith in the Article of <HI>Elec∣tion,</HI> our Author supposes couched in his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> were (if we may believe our <HI>Praefacer) taught the Faith of Christ from the Mouths of the Apostles or Apos∣tolick Men.</HI> Now, Gentlemen, we are come to the <HI>Rectilineal, and Uninterrupted Suc∣cession of Episcopacy, from the Apostles.</HI> Ay, and this Doctrine of the <HI>Choice Dia∣logues</HI> has been in the same <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Manner, by <HI>oral Tradition</HI> handed down by the <HI>Clergy</HI> to this Day. By <HI>Oral Tradition,</HI> I say, for this our Author, quotes none of the <HI>Writings</HI> of these <HI>Apostolick Men,</HI> or their <HI>Successors.</HI> But why need our Praefacer run us up to the Doctrine which he supposes these <HI>ancient Fathers</HI> received from the <HI>Apostles, and Apostolick Men?</HI> Does he think what <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp;c. told to <HI>Ignatius, Her∣mas the Pastor,</HI> &amp;c. more true, or more in∣telligible, than what for the Benefit of the Church in all Ages, he left in <HI>Writing?</HI> Does he think <HI>Paul, or Peter,</HI> &amp;c. could speak their Minds better to those Men, than
<PB N="x" REF="002194_0012_0FDACA3C980D2E48"/>they could <HI>Write</HI> in their <HI>Epistles?</HI> We have <HI>Paul</HI> by us, the <HI>sure Word of Prophesy,</HI> which is enough to inform us what he thought, when he met with a <HI>Mystery,</HI> and when he did not. We know <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to the <HI>Romans</HI> Things <HI>unsearchable and past finding out</HI> by any Mortal, not what is <HI>level with the Ca∣pacity of every Plough-Man;</HI> I mean as to this Doctrine of <HI>Praedestination.</HI> And here let me tell our Author, <HI>Paul's Writings</HI> are as valuable with me, nay more, since I am sure he wrote under the Conduct and Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, than a <HI>personal Interview</HI> with him. But I wish nevertheless, the Prae∣facer would Publish to the World what these brave Men were <HI>taught from the Mouths of the Apostles,</HI> relating to <HI>Praedestination.</HI> The World will own in their thankful Ac∣knowledgements their Obligations unto him.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Uninterrupted Succession of the Clergy from the Apostles,</HI> I mean of <HI>Bishops Diocesan,</HI> I never could see the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of them yet. It has hitherto been much such a Secret in Ecclesiastick State as is the <HI>Philo∣sophers Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kingdom of Na∣ture;</HI> of which it is often asserted there is such a Thing in <HI>Rerum Natura;</HI> but we never can be certain any Body has been so sagacious and sharp as to find it. But I drop the <HI>Chi∣mera,</HI> and let it vanish among the Shades.</P>
<P>But who is the <HI>Whore of Babylon, and the great Antichrist,</HI> &amp;c. It can't be the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> for that spoils the <HI>uninter∣rupted
<PB N="xi" REF="002194_0013_0FDACA3E181FA0F0"/>Succession</HI> in Part, and I know it is the Mind of the Praefacer, that <HI>Rome</HI> is a great Arm of the <HI>Catholick Church.</HI> Who is <HI>Antichrist</HI> then which he means? Why, they are <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> whom our Author joyns wth the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are a small Body, which I know the Praefacer thinks to be mainly intended in the <HI>Apocaypse.</HI> And yet in a few Lines after he calls us <HI>Fellow-Christians.</HI> They are <HI>Fellow-Christians,</HI> and yet have they <HI>followed blindly,</HI> for some scores of Years, <HI>blind Guides;</HI> nay, as in Conversation he will not scruple to call them <HI>false Brethren,</HI> and aver that they are no more <HI>Ministers of Christ,</HI> than every <HI>Carter and Dray-man</HI> that passeth the Street. How then can the <HI>Flocks</HI> of such <HI>false Brethren,</HI> be any other than <HI>false Churches,</HI> and degenerate Wolves; and are they then his <HI>Fellow Christians?</HI></P>
<P>But it would tire <HI>Job</HI> to recount all the Contradictions, and Absurdities in his Prae∣face. I shall therefore animadvert but upon <HI>some</HI> of the <HI>Multitude. Let us follow the Example of the Primitive Church, and give Ear to those pious and godly Fathers of the Church, who will teach us the Truth in Sincerity.</HI> To omit so small a Criticism as that, what is the Difference between <HI>[Pious]</HI> and <HI>[Godly,]</HI> as he stiles the Fathers of the Church? for I always was such a No∣vice, as to understand the same Thing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Piety and Godliness:</HI> I say, to omit that, let
<PB N="xii" REF="002194_0014_0FDACA3FEA8A9060"/>me observe how industrious the Praefacer is, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>pin his Faith upon the Church,</HI> which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems to suppose <HI>infallible.</HI> Why could be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lead us as well to the Fountain of all, the <HI>holy Scriptures?</HI> Especially, when he will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us know the <HI>Names</HI> of these <HI>pious and godly</HI> Fathers. The Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> may serve our Turn as well.</P>
<P>Now the Praefacer puts on an Air of Gravi∣ty, and takes up a Lamentation. <HI>Here I can∣not but take Notice of the sad and deplora∣ble Degeneracy of Mankind,</HI> &amp;c. Our <HI>Prae∣facer</HI> is not at all guilty of this, when in the next Page, he insinuates there is <HI>scarce a Book written by the Dissenters, which has com∣mon Sense in it, and they are not worth a Reading.</HI> And if wise Men refuse to cast their Eyes upon his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> he may conclude it is upon the <HI>same Suspicion,</HI> that they deny them the Honour of a Perusal.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> says the Praefacer, <HI>I have heard People say, that there is scarce one in Twen∣ty of the Books written by</HI> Dissenters, <HI>that have</HI> common Sense <HI>in them.</HI> He has <HI>heard</HI> so, but who <HI>told</HI> him? And what then? I have heard likewise many People say, that he writes like a <HI>Quaker. But whether this be true or not, let the World judge.</HI> Only cast your Eye, Reader, upon his Dialogue (I call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his, for he must <HI>father the Bratt,</HI> since his own Stuff is blended so much with <HI>(Lesleys)</HI> that no one can tell which is which) Look, I
<PB N="xiii" REF="002194_0015_0FDACA4120CC3998"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay upon Five of his first Lines in the <HI>Dia∣logue;</HI> where the <HI>Minister</HI> answers Friend. <HI>Countrey-Man,</HI> in these words.
<Q>I thank <HI>Thee</HI> honest Countrey Man; a good Morn∣ing to <HI>Thee</HI> likewise, and I pray God bless <HI>Thee:</HI> But I would know what has brought <HI>Thee</HI> to my house so early.</Q> And now, good Reader, what doest <HI>Thee</HI> think of it? <HI>Thee</HI> must think he is <HI>quakerishly</HI> inclined.</P>
<P>There is another Sentence in his Praeface, which is so <HI>well Worded,</HI> I dare not attack it. It is a Specimen of the <HI>true Sublime,</HI> I shall only transcribe it, and leave it with the Rea∣der as a considerable Piece of <HI>Rhetoric,</HI> and the Stile of one, who has read <HI>Longinus.</HI> It is this. Be it <HI>true</HI> or not <HI>true,</HI> this I am sure is a <HI>true</HI> saying, viz. <HI>Wisdom is justified of her Children.</HI> Here is <HI>Truth</HI> upon <HI>Truth!</HI></P>
<P>Our Praefacer goes on to give Reasons why <HI>the Writings of Nonconformists of all De∣nominations</HI> be not <HI>quite so polite as the Works of some others.</HI> It is, says he, <HI>Be∣cause they write so much.</HI> Here, Reader, not the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> only, but <HI>Nonconfor∣mists</HI> of <HI>all Denominations</HI> are attacked. What then, all the famous Writings of Learned Men abroad, who are <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> are not <HI>Polite,</HI> that because the Writers of them are such as <HI>Bayle, Witsius, Voet, Basnage,</HI> &amp;c. Nay, and of some, what were <HI>Owen, Bates, Charnock, Gale, Clarkson,</HI> &amp;c. and among the more Modern, what are <HI>Calamy, Watts, &amp;c,</HI> aye and <HI>Pierce</HI> too; for allowing him to
<PB N="xiv" REF="002194_0016_0FDACA429A8254C8"/>be an <HI>Heretick,</HI> he can't be called a <HI>Clumsy Writer.</HI> I might mention many more, but I forbear. I only add, were not <HI>Stillingfleet, Tillotson,</HI> Bishop <HI>Hopkins, Burnet,</HI> and others Polite, until they conformed to the <HI>Church;</HI> and then (I warrant you) as it were by the Touch of the <HI>Lapis Aurificus</HI> of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> all of a sudden they were turned into <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>Is <HI>Writing so much</HI> the Cause of our <HI>unpo∣lisned Way of Writing;</HI> let our <HI>learned Prefacer</HI> take Care of himself, who sets up for an <HI>Author of two or three Books,</HI> while in his <HI>Non-age.</HI> And to set the World a Gig after his Rhapsodies, is forced to insinuate stily that he is an <HI>aged Labourer in Christ's Vineyard.</HI> Ay, and in the End of his Pre∣face, helps the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> (viz. <HI>Junior Presbyterian</HI> Clergy-Men) to an Argument against Praedestination, because <HI>they are but Young</HI></P>
<P>As for what follows of <HI>Giddiness</HI> arising from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> circular Method of Reasoning,</HI> and a <HI>Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on exceeding quick and rapid;</HI> I leave the Reader to apply it to the Author himself, who has fairly revolved thro' the Circle of <HI>Armini∣anism, Pelagianism,</HI> and <HI>Calvinism;</HI> and has so slipt from one Inconsistency to another, that to use an old <HI>Latin</HI> Scrap, I learn't at School, <HI>citius Anguillam Canda teneas.</HI></P>
<P>Now stand clear, the Prefacer has took a Voyage over to <HI>Holland.</HI> Huzzah! The <HI>Dutch</HI> are routed! <HI>Jack</HI> has broke down their

<P>But was our Prefacer ever in <HI>Holland,</HI> that he has taken the Distemper, the Lear∣ned Call, <HI>Lust of Writing?</HI> Happy, that he has made trial of our <HI>Charity,</HI> which <HI>forces us to buy up his painful and labo∣rious Searches and Researches after the</HI> true Meaning <HI>of Praedestination and Fore∣knowledge,</HI> viz. to throw aside those two dire Particles <HI>[Prae]</HI> and <HI>[Fore]</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Regeneration</HI> is something more than <HI>Episcopal Baptism,</HI> let him think what he pleases, notwithstanding his great <HI>Dodwell</HI> attributes to the Efficacy thereof, the <HI>Im∣mortality of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="002194_0018_0FDAC8A1920E6020"/>
But where is the Impropriety of the Word <HI>Recumbency?</HI> Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> uses as had an one, when he tells us of <HI>Rolling our selves on the Mercy of God.</HI> And why does not that Word very aptly express our <HI>Reliance</HI> upon the Great Saviour Jesus Christ by faith. Did you never read, <HI>Psal. 55 2. Cast thy Burden upon the Lord.</HI> And Cant. <HI>8.5. Who is this that cometh up from the Wilderness leaning upon her Beloved?</HI> which is meant of the Church in their <HI>Faith and Reliance</HI> in the <HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
<P>As for his Ridicules upon <HI>Extempory</HI> Prayer, a man is very apt (as the <HI>Fox</HI> in the Fable) to call it sowre stuff, because it is out of his Reach. So we find such Men, as the Prefacer, are of the Mind, that by the <HI>Gift, and Spirit of Prayer,</HI> together with the <HI>holy Ghost's helping our Infir∣mities, &amp;c.</HI> is meant no more than an abili∣ty to read over half a dozen <HI>Forms.</HI> The Apostle says, <HI>We know not WHAT to Pray for, and the Spirit helpeth our IN∣FIRMITIES.</HI> I warrant you the Meaning of the Apostle was; <HI>Your Form tells you what to Pray for, and the Spirit helps you to recite.</HI> But I don't design a Con∣troversy upon this Matter. Let every Chris∣tian use what his Conscience tells him is best. Nor have I the arrogance to attack the <HI>Church of England;</HI> but I hope it is no <HI>Arrogance</HI> to attack our <HI>Prefacer;</HI> for I know wise and
<PB N="xvii" REF="002194_0019_0FDACA47235AB860"/>good Men of his <HI>own Communion</HI> are asha∣med of his Performance. And this the <HI>Pre∣facer</HI> seems to be well aware of, when he says afterwards, <HI>I expect there will be many things objected against the following Pa∣pers, for there are many who call them∣selves Church of England Men, who won't like what these Papers contain.</HI> And so I believe; a Man need not to have been a Conjurer to have <HI>foretold</HI> that, (or to leave out <HI>[fore]</HI> have <HI>told</HI> that.</P>
<P>As for <HI>three Sermons a day,</HI> I have nothing to answer to the <HI>Heinous Charge,</HI> but a Pas∣sags out of Dr. <HI>Wild</HI>'s Poems, entituled, <HI>The Loyal Non-Conformist.</HI></P>

<P>Or else what a Clergy-Man once said, who was <HI>very busy always at Court,</HI> and never had Leisure to exercise his Gifts in <HI>Preach∣ing,</HI> or never much inclined that Way, <HI>viz.</HI> that a <HI>Preaching Bishop</HI> was a <HI>Preaching Coxcomb.</HI></P>
<P>Our Praefacer proceeds to banter the <HI>Young Stripplings,</HI> upon a Passage which a <HI>celebrated Writer</HI> at a certain <HI>Ordination</HI> (if he'll al∣low the Expression) made use of to the Com∣mendation of the <HI>Younger Clergy</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI>

<P><HI>Let me (I beseech ye) advise Gainsay∣ers to take heed how they oppose them, for here is nothing but</HI> convince and confound; <HI>Stand clear, here is no Quarter to be given.</HI> And I pray, why not <HI>convince,</HI> and <HI>confound,</HI> as well as <HI>prove to a Demonstration,</HI> as you pretend your <HI>terrible Syllogism</HI> over-leaf a∣mounts unto. <HI>Demonstration,</HI> a favourite Word among you, as every Body observes, and you scorn to measure your <HI>Syllogisms</HI> with any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gauge. <HI>Demonstration!</HI> Were <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lid</HI> alive he would run mad, to see what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so sacred to him, and the Prerogative of the <HI>Geometricians</HI> so prostituted.

<P>What a strong Foundation are the <HI>Dialogues</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon? <HI>Two absolute Contradictions can't be true at once.</HI> How terrifying must this be to the Reader, when he thinks that to hold Predestination, is to offer Vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce to his Ʋnderstanding equal to the As∣sertion of the <HI>Existence and Non-existence∣of a Thing at the same time.</HI> O the a∣mazing Power and Force of <HI>Logic!</HI> And yet <HI>whole Churches</HI> have been so sotrish as to acquiesce in so absurd a Tenet. What a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thing is it to be born in the Ends of the World, when Things formerly disputable, and much controversed, are now proved to a <HI>Demonstration;</HI> and now to persist in our former Doctrine, is equally absurd as the Denial of that eternal incontestible <HI>Maxim</HI> of the <HI>Metaphysicians, Res non potest Esse et non Esse eodem Tempore.—</HI> I am crop sick of <HI>Demonstrations.</HI> Depend upon it, <HI>Demonstrations</HI> will soon grow out of Credit, and be but a Drugg in the Mar∣ket of Literature, if his <HI>Choice Dialogues</HI> may be enrolled among the <HI>Apodictices</HI> of the Age.</P>

<P>Two absolute Contradictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now our <HI>Champion</HI> is taking leave of us in his Praeface, but yet with the Civility of <HI>begging upon his Knees;</HI> it is to <HI>beg to give a little advice to those Persons in∣to whose Hands his Papers shall fall, that they would not, if they happen to find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y thing</HI> displeasing to them, <HI>immediately throw them out of their Hands.</HI> This <HI>A∣ged</HI> Gentleman who had just now been sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lying some <HI>Young Men</HI> with an Argument; has no better Advice left to give to all <HI>Old or Young,</HI> but to read diligently his <HI>Dialogues.</HI> What Nonsense is this, if they scorn the <HI>Dialogues themselves,</HI> his <HI>Ad∣vice</HI> will not succeed a whit better.

<P>But why would he have us read them? Why, he says, <HI>they will rightly instruct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s concerning some of those Things in</HI> Paul's <HI>Epistles, which</HI> Peter <HI>says, are hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest to their own Destru∣ction.

<P><HI>Dear</HI> Namesake; <HI>if you could but convey your lucky</HI> Sir-name <HI>to me too; but what is it you have to say?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Master, Satan, has divers things to tell you. He expects e're long to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you in Person; but this he desers to the time appointed, when he who hath set you to work will pay you your Wages. He would have had himself a <HI>Dialog ue</HI> with you, if he could have had the famous <HI>Danson</HI> pre∣sent; but he being long since gone to a bet∣ter place, it may do, if an old fellow-ser∣vant of yours (one old enough to be your great Grand-father, and one who has been

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Tory.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It becomes a Servant readily to hear, what his Master has to say to him; and that I have served him faithfully and painfully, Troth, he knows it very well; but whether my Time won't be out before</HI> twice thirty Years <HI>come to a period, perhaps he knows no more than 1. For I scorn Prae∣destination even from the Mouth of my Ma∣ster. But what then, friend</HI> Faustus, <HI>I am uneasie, Dear Namesake, till you tell me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, friend John, I'll tell thee what; first, thy M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster thinks, he has Thanks to Con thee for the Honour and Service you have so faithfully endea∣voured for him, in maintaining, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Scotch Presbyterians,</HI> and all the Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> and all their Pastors <HI>worship the Devil.</HI> The Devil's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> old Blasphemer; Blasphemies he loves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Life, they are <HI>Melodies</HI> to him. The very first Leaf of your Choice Dialogues repeats these Choice Blasphemies. That is in plain Terms, if Men worship a GOD, <HI>who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as fore-ondained whatsoever comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass;</HI> and if in their Prayers Men own that without the help of <HI>Special Grace</HI> from him, they shall never convert unto him; you say, they <HI>Worship the Devil under the Name of God.</HI> I confess it four as
<PB N="3" REF="002194_0027_0FDACA531AE4D3A0"/>a little hideous to me, as bad as People take me to be. But you had a Mind it may be, Jack, to have something more of the <HI>Hero</HI> in you, than your great Bro∣ther <HI>She phard</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Your Master has given Demonstration enough of his affecting the Throne of the most high God. But really, friend John, you have done something even beyond his Ex∣pectation, to claim it for him. Formerly he used to value himself upon being the Object of all Worship from the <HI>Japanese,</HI> the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Salvages. He never imagined that all the <HI>Calvinists</HI> in the World, which amount to several Mil∣lions, and a very distinguished and superi∣or part of Mankind, are also his Wor∣shippers. I protest John, I am so well acquainted with our Master, that I know he trembles before the God, whom the <HI>Calvinists</HI> pray to.</P>
<P>But avast! I remember now King <HI>William</HI> was a <HI>Calvinist.</HI> But sure, it is not upon his account that you so horribly blaspheme the God he prayed to? For I remember, you never much liked him. O hungry and hardly bestead, that you can't content your self with cursing the King, whose immortal Memory, you and our Master abominate; but you must look upward and curse his God too!</P>
<P>Look you, <HI>John,</HI> hitherto your Master
<PB N="4" REF="002194_0028_0FDACA5499CD3980"/>pleased himself with being <HI>the God of this World.</HI> But there is a Sett of People <HI>Called out of this World,</HI> who are continually lift∣ing up their Cries to the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> that he would quicken them to <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>believe;</HI> and who ascribe to <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> the whole Glory of every good Thing per∣formed by them in a Way of Living unto God. Now, John, these were the People of all the World, which your Master and mine gave over as lost; he has <HI>hue-in-cried</HI> them as Runaways, and has taken all Opportuni∣ties to blacken them with such Pens as your's (that writes all his <HI>Advertisements</HI> for him) for <HI>Brutes</HI> and <HI>Brute-Makers;</HI> But it seems by you, that these also are they, who <HI>fall down and worship him.</HI> This is beyond what your Master himself ever imagined. He was in you, <HI>John,</HI> all the time you were a Scribling for him, tho' perhaps you were not aware of it. But how comes it, <HI>John,</HI> you're gone beyond his Inspiration? You have pleased him won∣derfully; For tho' he be a Spirit full of Envy, yet he is not so envious, as to be dis∣pleased when he sees himself out-done in Devilism. You must not wonder at it, that when you say, the God of the <HI>Calvinists</HI> is more cruel than the <HI>Devil,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> should applaud himself, for having a Man <HI>John,</HI> who bids so hopefully to out-do his Master.</P>

<P><HI>What then does Master think, I have out Devil'd the De'll himself! I hope then, tho' the</HI> Stripplings, <HI>in which the Churches of</HI> N. E. <HI>forsooth, think themselves</HI> highly favoured, <HI>are a parcel of little sense∣less Creatures; yet the Countrey may be a∣ble to show one</HI> Jacobite Strippling, <HI>that can do something to the Purpose.

<P><HI>I am surprized at that! pray why so!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll tell you. He says, he is more unhappy in Servants, than any other Master in the World. All of them serve him <HI>willingly;</HI> many serve him <HI>indust∣riously,</HI> and some serve him very <HI>successful∣ly.</HI> But still he says, they are generally block heads, and the Rascals do him as much Mischief, as they do him Service; They spoil many a good cause by such a blocked∣ly Management, as would vex the heart of any Master in the lower Regions to look upon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack Tory.</SPEAKER>
<P>— <HI>O alas, I hope I have not mismanaged a Cause, which my heart was so set upon, that all my friends by all their

But I was so cun∣ning</HI>—I told them, I had a Commission from God, and I must obey God rather than Man. <HI>I know my friends foretold (ac∣cording to a good old Proverb more than</HI> twice thirty years <HI>old,</HI>) <HI>that</HI> I must needs go, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but you have mismana∣ged most confoundedly I will show you several Points before I part with you. For I can't tarry all Night with you, to shew you them all. But I protest, I will have the Patience to tell you a few of them—Why then, what a <HI>folly,</HI> what a Madness was it in you to begin your <HI>Leslean</HI> Transcripts with such a shocking <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> which I my self don't care to repeat, as bad as People take me to be, I have more Grace then that comes to. O, alas, that a man should ever be such a <HI>Numbskull!</HI> could it ever enter in∣to your addle Pate, that your Pamphlet could ever find the least Reception in the Coun∣try; when one of the first Things they meet with is your more than Diabolical Censure of them as <HI>Worshippers of the De∣vil. That the God they pray to is the Devil; yea, more cruel than the Devil.</HI> Troth <HI>Jack,</HI>
<PB REF="002194_0031_0FDACA5917EAB228"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> very first Page, to represent a <HI>Congregation of Dissenters,</HI> as a <HI>Congregation of Devils.</HI> But, I profess, you set me a trembling, when you make their <HI>God</HI> a <HI>Devil</HI> too; and represent him as the great <HI>Belzebub,</HI> the chief of all the rest of the Congregation. <HI>Horresco re∣ferens!</HI> I tell you, this over Devilish Passage has quite ruined your whole Design. Eve∣ry Body will treat you and your Pamphlet with abhorrence, &amp; wonder a Christian Go∣vernment has not condemned it to be thrown into the Flames, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (<HI>John Faustus</HI> bids you beware of such a Doom your self) which without the least Infringement upon <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> might be justly order∣ed for it. Methinks I hear the People, be∣fore they have read out the first Leaf of your fine Rhapsody, exclaiming,—<HI>Lord, what is it this fellow means? Does the Fool think to perswade the good People of the Coun∣try, that the God whom their pious Fathers prayed to, was the Devil,</HI> and that they are by Consequence gone to him? <HI>Does he per∣swade us, that all the Prayers offered up in the Churches, and in the Houses throughout the Country, are but so many Invocations of the Prince of Darkness!</HI> Let me tell thee friend <HI>Jack,</HI> he that would proselite the People of <HI>New-England</HI> unto the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Opinions must go more soberly to work. You have managed the Cause like a <HI>Tinker.</HI> You

Look ye, thy fondness for this Blasphemy has undone thy Dialogues, and rendered them utterly ineffectual to all Intents and Purposes. I have been thought a Conjurer (tho' I dare protest thou art none;) But without any <HI>Conjuring</HI> for it, I can foretell, that if any People receive any Impressions from thy Pamphlet, they must be only such as have not so much Brains as a Mouse-Squirrel in them. <HI>Jack,</HI> thou knowest what a Rattle Snake is; and thou knowest he carries his <HI>Rattle</HI> in his <HI>Tail,</HI> &amp; gives Men warning to <HI>Stand clear;</HI> but thou carriest thine in thy <HI>head;</HI> how unhappy art thou, that all this Blasphemy might not come in at the <HI>Tail</HI> of thy Dialogues. Thy very first Leaf must be the Seat of the Cu∣riosity. Why, the very <HI>Tobacconists</HI> will be afraid of your Pamphlets to use them as waste Paper, for fear the strong scent of Brimstone (for they know from whence it came) worse then <HI>Mandungus,</HI> should cor∣rupt the Tobacco.</P>

<P>Ay, you say they worship <HI>the Devil, or one more cruel than the Devil.</HI> And your Master is very angry at it. I will say this for thee, <HI>Jack,</HI> thou hast been a very diligent Slave of his, and hast laid
<PB N="9" REF="002194_0033_0FDACA5C1994C848"/>thy self out with all thy Might and Craft to debauch the <HI>Young Stripplings</HI> of <HI>New-En∣gland</HI> in their Principles, and bring them to forsake the God and Hope of their Fathers; but thy Game is now over.

<P>Oh! And so you think to come off with the sham in your Title-Page of a <HI>Re∣verend who—knows—who,</HI> and one who has been for above <HI>twice thirty years a Labourer.</HI> Every Body knows what <HI>Reverence</HI> is due to <HI>you.</HI> What have you been <HI>so long a Labour∣er?</HI> It was pretty cunning, I profess under such a Disguise to draw on the Readers of the Title Page, to peruse <HI>your</HI> unmannerly Preface and Mungril Dialogues, begotten by a juggle between thee &amp; <HI>Lesley.</HI> It has caused undiscerning People, upon an apprehension that it was written by a certain Aged Gen∣tleman in <HI>New-England,</HI> whom you and our Master hate to give it the honour of a Pe∣rusal. I profess, <HI>Jack,</HI> I am ashamed of such a little mean Artifice. But to return, you have so blended your own Stuff with <HI>Lesley's,</HI> that scarce any Body can tell which is which:
<PB REF="002194_0034_0FDACA5D9A468830"/>But a man that can see but an Inch may be sure of this, that it appears like an <HI>old Gar∣ment</HI> patched with <HI>New Cloth,</HI> and the <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Tatters</HI> appear horrid and rueful. Nay, more than this, you have hurt poor <HI>Lesley</HI> too, if it be possible.

<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Master commends you for the Pains you have been at, to release People from <HI>Prayers</HI> to God, for the <HI>quick∣ening Influences</HI> of his <HI>Grace,</HI> to turn them <HI>from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</HI> And by Consequence from all Praises to him for his <HI>Grace,</HI> if they have received it. Tho' to disswade the <HI>Effectually Called</HI> from the Praises of God for Converting them to himself, will be an im∣possible Undertaking. For let me tell thee, <HI>Child,</HI> no Body will be such a <HI>Numb skull</HI> as to think the Grace of God never did any more for <HI>Peter,</HI> than for our Brother <HI>Ju∣das;</HI> it is a much easier Thing to disswade the ungodly from serious <HI>Prayers</HI> to God for their Conversion. Now, what Occasion for <HI>Prayers,</HI> if the Sinner has it entirely in his own Power to turn himself. What would his Petitions be in this Case but emp∣ty, needless, useless Complements to Al∣mighty God, if he can do it without him.
<PB N="12" REF="002194_0036_0FDACA6098084478"/>He can come out of the <HI>Burning Prison,</HI> whereof you make such a Plausible Simile, without any <HI>Special Help</HI> of him that calls him out. What need he beg, <HI>Lord, bring my Soul out of Prison.</HI> This Contempt which you would have People to cast upon the Aids of <HI>Grace,</HI> is a notable Way to for∣feit them, and Sin them away, and confirm our Fellow-Slaves in their Servitude.</P>

<P><HI>Nay, I don't say so.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>But our Master hopes you <HI>mean</HI> so. For if you allow <HI>Special Grace</HI> to be wholly needless, and that there is no∣thing needs to be superadded to that <HI>Com∣mon Grace,</HI> which you suppose to be an uni∣versal Bequest from God, extending to the whole Race of fallen <HI>Adam;</HI> you must grant also, that it is entirely unnecessary to ask for any such thing of God. You would not ask for what you can do well enough without.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack Tory.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But what, have not I allowed for it, and owned that the Special Help of Grace is needful, according to one of the Arti∣cles of the Church, of which I pretend to be a Member,</HI> [<HI>Article</HI> 10.] The Condition of Man, after the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural Strength, and good Works to Faith, and Calling upon God: Wherefore we have no Power to do good Works, plea∣sant and acceptable to God, without the
<PB N="13" REF="002194_0037_0FDACA621AC21900"/>Grace of God by Christ preventing us, <HI>that we may have a</HI> good Will, <HI>and working with us</HI> when we have that good Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>But here, my poor Child, thou involvest thy self in irreconcileable Contradictions. If you once own, that none do turn to God, without the <HI>Special Help</HI> of his <HI>Grace;</HI> you must also say, that there is a <HI>Special Knowledge</HI> (and so a <HI>Speci∣al Purpose</HI>) which he has of them to whom he gives it. And then you spoil all your Talk. Only say, that we need <HI>Special Grace,</HI> and you spoil all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack Tory.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I should be loth to do that.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, thou hast done so, by owning that <HI>we have no Power of our∣selves to help our selves;</HI> and that the <HI>Assist∣ence of the Grace</HI> of Christ is, that, <HI>Without which we can neither do a good Deed, nor think a good Thought.</HI> No <HI>Calvinist</HI> upon Earth ever said more.</P>
</SP>

I am further to tell you, that your Master is ex∣treamly taken with your scoffs at <HI>Regenerati∣on,</HI> in your <HI>Preface.</HI> He entertains great Hopes concerning you, when he finds you have out-done <HI>Nicodemus</HI> before his Con∣version, in his <HI>Ignorance</HI> of this <HI>great Myste∣ry.</HI> [Read <HI>John</HI> 3.] And hopes that your Eyes will never be opened to understand such <HI>Mysterious Tractates,</HI> which if you felt the power of what they teach, he would for ever despair of having any more of your as∣sistance, in advancing his Interest.

<SPEAKER>Jack Tory.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But</HI> I <HI>am very much afraid, that the Books written by</HI> Dissenters, <HI>which fills this Country, and our Nation, will be of great Influence (by the Blessing of Hea∣ven) towards the</HI> regenerating <HI>more than we could wish for.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>And here again I must tell you, that our Master is intollerably vexed at you, for another of your Absurdities. You say, <HI>that there is scarce one in Twenty of the Books written by the Dissenters, that have common sense in them.</HI> Now because you must be unfortunate in every Thing you go upon, there is hardly one Word of <HI>Common. Sense</HI> in your <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> but what you have Stole from the <HI>Dissenter's</HI> Wri∣tings. The most sensible Passage in them, is in the Fifteenth Page, where [<HI>whip scratch ye</HI>] you have such a pious Qualm comes up∣on you, as compels you to say, <HI>I have the Promise of Christ,</HI> &amp;c. Except what is in these few Lines, there is hardly one Word worth a straw in all your <HI>Dialogues,</HI> in the Esteem of wise and good Men. Yes, now I think on't, there is one Word more in your Eleventh Page. <HI>The Covenant God has made with us in CHRIST, is impossible to be frustrated.</HI> How unhappy you are, Friend <HI>Jack!</HI> that one Word overthrows all your <HI>Dialogues.</HI> Now, where did you get all this <HI>Divinity?</HI> It's a Heap of <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Stuff. You either Stole these Passages from
<PB N="16" REF="002194_0040_0FDACA6697FEE608"/>the Books of <HI>Dissenters,</HI> or from the Divines of the Established Church, who so favour <HI>them,</HI> as to be abhorred by you as much as the <HI>Dissenters</HI> themselves. Your Master will claw you off, for this confounded In∣consistence in establishing <HI>Calvinism,</HI> while you are prttending to confute it. He is much disturbed at your <HI>Treachery.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Faust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, in this <HI>Jack,</HI> thou art meritorious enough. But you have charged the <HI>Calvinists</HI> with asserting that, which you &amp; all the World knows they for ever abhor and disclaim; You know they for ever maintain, that the Glorious God is not the Author of Sin, nor can be the Author of Sin. And that his Decrees are all righteous, and holy. And that that Sin is to be wholly charged upon the Sinner; his own proper Fault, proceeding from the vitiosity of his own Will. If you had not foreswore reading of them (under a pretence there is scarce <HI>common sense</HI> in any one of them) you might have seen their Books abound with such like Asserti∣ons. You were very fit, upon my word, to manage a Controversie with <HI>Calvinists,</HI> when you your self never read what their Tenets are. Ay, never read! What, are not your Brains settled yet! Sometimes thro' your want of Reading, and of a true Knowledge
<PB N="17" REF="002194_0041_0FDACA6842A0AF08"/>of what a <HI>Dissenter</HI> and a <HI>Calvinist</HI> is, you turn <HI>Calvinist</HI> your self, and don't know of it; then you tack about, and protest they assert what they never held in the World. I am amazed at it; why, you neither know what is <HI>Calvinism,</HI> nor what is <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>Did you never read or hear of a famous English Parliament of <HI>Calvinists,</HI> who when a certain Writer [one Mr. <HI>Archer</HI>] had written a Book, that seemed a little to ap∣proach toward making God the <HI>Author of Sin,</HI> ordered the Book to be burnt (if you will allow the Expression of your Friend <HI>Faustus</HI>) as a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Presbyterians, whom you so much hate.</P>

<P>Yes, People used to be fright∣ed with <HI>John Faustus.</HI> But I'll shew thee thy Transgressions.

Ʋnless then, you'll be a <HI>Stoic</HI> too, you must allow <HI>Fore-knowledge</HI> to be the same with <HI>Fore-ordaining.</HI> Now, you'll find it impossible to get clear of this Encum∣brance upon you; but by absolutely de∣nying any <HI>Fore-knowledge</HI> in God at all; tho' the Scripture does so often in ex∣press Terms assign it unto him. Here
<PB N="19" REF="002194_0043_0FDACA6B25205948"/>you fall into unmerciful Blunders, which a <HI>New-England Strippling</HI> would be asha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med of, and scorn to be guilty of.

Do you brag in your Preface, that your <HI>Dialogues</HI> will instruct People concerning some things in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles, which <HI>Peter</HI> says are <HI>hard to be understood.</HI> [And why not St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>Peter,</HI> you unmannerly <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> you?

<PB N="21" REF="002194_0045_0FDACA6E55BB6A60"/>But then in your <HI>Tenth</HI> Page of your Dia∣logues (Ay, friend <HI>Tory,</HI> the <HI>Tenth</HI> Page) you say expresly in so many Words, <HI>There it nothing hard to be understood</HI> in it. This Circular <HI>Way</HI> of Arguing has made you confounded Giddy. Now in the <HI>Pauline</HI> Epistles, there are such cruel Passages, and so directly establishing of <HI>Calvinism,</HI> that your <HI>Dialogues</HI> are all but so many plain Contradictions to the inspired Oracles of God, except you can by any means and me∣thods, disencumber your selves of these <HI>un∣happy Epistles.</HI> And there is but one Way for you to do it; the Way taken by a brave <HI>Pelagian</HI> Gentleman, who being pres∣sed with some of those Passages; replied unto Colonel <HI>Norton:</HI> Indeed St. <HI>Paul was, I confess, much of a Gentleman,</HI> and I am <HI>ve∣ry much his humble Servant; but begging his Pardon, I must say, I think he had much better have spared those Passages.</HI> You should have said so, or have said, as lately some of your Tribe have begun to say, <HI>The Christian Reli∣gion is not to be taken out of</HI> Paul's <HI>Epistles.</HI></P>

<P>Ha, Ha, Ha! When every one knows, that the <HI>Jesuites</HI> and the worst Sects of the <HI>Roman Catholics</HI> are the most earnest Abettors, and Propagators of the <HI>Palagian</HI> Principles, which your muddy <HI>Dialogues</HI> de∣sign to infect the Young People of the Country with. I'll quote you two Passages, which I find in two Writers of the Church of England, and so for the present I'll have done with you. The one is from Dr <HI>Edwards</HI> (whom when thou, <HI>Jack,</HI> encountrest with∣al, methinks it looks like a little Frog leaping in the Face of a Lion.) He says in his Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch∣er. Part. II. <HI>Page.</HI> 177.</P>
<P><HI>HOW can we blame the Dissenters for disgust∣ing, the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, when we our selves disrelish its Arti∣cles? Yea, when we know that they outdo many of us in Purity of Doctrine, and that they are very careful in Asserting and Maintaining it. Let it seem strange that a Member and a Min∣ister of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>calls upon you to take Notice of the Good Hand of God and His Wife Providence in this very Matter. If we would open our Eyes, we should see that we are beholding to the</HI> Sober <HI>and</HI> Moderate Dis∣senters <HI>for the Continuance of a Considerable
<PB N="26" REF="002194_0050_0FDACA759814BFC8"/>Part of our Theological Principles among us, even those which the Church of</HI> England <HI>and her Reformers had left us. If there had been none of that Party, the Church of</HI> En∣gland <HI>had been long since ruin'd; for if the High Church-men had had no Check, they would have brought in Popery before this Time, by a Side-wind of</HI> Arminianism, <HI>and by their over valuing of</HI> Ceremony <HI>and</HI> Pomp <HI>in Divine Worship.</HI></P>
<P>The other is from the Author of <HI>Reflecti∣ons on Mahometanism, &amp; Socinianism.</HI>
<Q>The most Formidable Stuff to <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> &amp; that upon which most People have made Shipwreck, is <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> an Error so natural to corrupt Man, that tho' there is none more powerfully withstood and opposed in Scripture, yet it has been commonly the most universal of all Heresies. By this the first Advances are made, that lead directly to the Doct∣rine of the <HI>Ʋnitarians.</HI> So soon as Man is enamoured with himself, and puts him∣self in the Place of God, he perverts all the Truths of Christianity.</Q></P>

<P>Well, go on, <HI>Jack,</HI> and prosper! I told you, for the present I
<PB N="27" REF="002194_0051_0FDACA772499B488"/>have done with you. Only I must ask your Pardon for one Word, I let fall just now, when I said our Master was <HI>in you.</HI> Look ye, <HI>Jack,</HI> it makes me think of the Story of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> who pretended to be <HI>sent by the Lord.</HI> An unlucky Boy repli∣ed, <HI>Nay, that can't be; for thou hast spoken Things contrary to what we have in the known Word of the Lord.</HI> But the <HI>Strip∣pling</HI> went on, <HI>Yet, I profess,</HI> (says he) <HI>it puzzles one to think, who should send thee. For I can't but think, the Devil would have more wit than to have sent such a Tinker as thou, art upon his Messages.</HI> And so I must leave you in the <HI>Limbo</HI> of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> which is between Heaven and Hell, for your <HI>Commission.</HI> You have been very much of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> in following the <HI>Impulses,</HI> which pushed forth your <HI>Dia∣logues.</HI> All that I can conclude from your [<HI>Thou</HI>] and [<HI>Thee,</HI>] must be, either that you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a <HI>Praying</HI> to your <HI>Clergy-Man</HI> (who I suppose you don't intend for the God of the <HI>Calvinists;</HI> for you have Con∣verted your <HI>Country-Man,</HI> who makes a notable Figure in your <HI>Dialogues,</HI> from <HI>Calvinism,</HI> as easie a Convert as ever I saw in my Life!) or else your [<HI>Thou</HI>] and [<HI>Thee</HI>] to him looks as if [<HI>Thou</HI>] were growing a little <HI>Quakerish,</HI> Friend <HI>John,</HI> and the Spirit of <HI>Quakerism</HI> were beginning some of its Breezes upon <HI>Thee.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002194_0052_0FDACA7898A07568"/>But I admire at it, that when this Spirit has been in you, by an <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Inspi∣ration, he has at last left you to bring so much Confusion upon our Cause, by your <HI>self-Destroying Dialogues.</HI></P>
<P>But, perhaps, the Style of <HI>Prayer,</HI> in which your <HI>Country-man</HI> addresses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our <HI>Clergy man</HI> (Ten times more like a Pray∣er, that the Dedication of the Bible to King <HI>James,</HI> which was re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a poor Savlor in a Storm for such) is used the better to keep touch with a Passage in your pretended Epis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to the <HI>Magnesians,</HI> immediately fol∣lowing it, (whereof Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> hath said enough to prove it an <HI>Imposture</HI>) which directs the People to yield all <HI>Reverence un∣to the Bishop</HI> (who was not more than the Pastor of a Congregational Church; yea, and but a <HI>Strippling</HI> too! the latter part of which Character is evident from the <HI>third</HI> Paragraph in the Epistle) I say, which di∣rects the People to yield <HI>all Reverence unto the Bishop, according to the</HI> POWER OF GOD the FATHER.</P>
<P>But I have done with thee, <HI>Jack,</HI> I doubt I shall be chid for staying so long. But one word more before we part; I hear thou art under invincible Difficulties about taking the <HI>Oaths of Allegiance</HI> to King <HI>George. Jack,</HI> it came pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t into my Mind about your <HI>Burn∣ing Pit,</HI> which flames and scorches so in your <HI>Dialogues:</HI> Methinks you are so in the
<PB N="29" REF="002194_0053_0FDACA7A25469270"/><HI>Limbo</HI>'s, environed about with such a terri∣ble Prison, the <HI>Court</HI> standing without calling thee to <HI>come out of the Fire,</HI> and that upon more rational Considerations than you sup∣pose the God of the <HI>Calvinists</HI> treats with his <HI>important Devotees.</HI> You <HI>can</HI> come out, exercise, <HI>Jack,</HI> your <HI>Free-Will,</HI> (Pray, <HI>O Liberum arbitrium, miserere mei!</HI> leap forth from the Flames. To use the Words of your Dialogues, Page 27, 28. <HI>The Applicati∣on is this, the Condemnation lies wholly at thy own Door, because thou wouldest not accept of Liberty; something is left to the Prisoner to do,</HI> viz. <HI>to chuse whether he would come out or stay in.</HI> The Court <HI>will not Save you a∣gainst your Will.</HI> This is no Burlesqueing of the Deity, though his Name be there found, but in these passages of the <HI>burning Prison,</HI> thou hast blasphemed the plain Ora∣cles of God.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I conclude this small Book, I flatter my self, it will not be disa∣greeable, nor unprofitable to such Readers, who have not Time and Leisure to enquire into the Merits of the Cause in this Controversy of <HI>Predestination,</HI> if I finish my Answer to the <HI>Choice Dia∣logues,</HI> with the Consideration of the fol∣lowing Heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the primitive Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> relating to the Arti∣cle of <HI>Predestination</HI> was <HI>Calvinistical;</HI> and in this sense of the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> the first <HI>En∣glish</HI> Reformers held that Article. I am not at present about to prove the Truth, &amp; the agreeableness of these Articles to the holy Scriptures; but only in Opposition to our <HI>Dialogist,</HI> to shew that he either does not know, or else falsifies, the true Tenets of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> The <HI>Church of England,</HI> (I say) for it matters not what the Church at present holds, but what the first Reformers, and Founders thereof de∣clared to be their Faith. That is the true Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which was first maintained, and not at all the less
<PB N="32" REF="002194_0056_0FDACA7E97BC37B8"/>for their having in a great Measure fallen from it. And here I might have made the World believe (as my <HI>Antagonist</HI> has done) that my own laborious Research<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had help∣ed me to what I am going to set down as the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And it had been indeed no hard Task; but I chuse rather to transcribe a Part of a Let∣ter of Mr. <HI>Francis Mackemie,</HI> in a Pastoral Letter to the Reformed Protestants in <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> as a Vindication of the Dissenters. It is in the Postcript to his Letter. The Words are as follow.</P>
<P>I must confess I have oft heard, how some upon all occasions, have bitterly run at the <HI>Doctrine of Predestination,</HI> as if none main∣tained such a Doctrine but we; And a <HI>Mi∣nister of your</HI> Island, <HI>called it, A damnable Doctrine:</HI> and I now justly wonder to re∣ceive such a Character of <HI>Predestination</HI> from some, that it is <HI>contrary to the Word of God, and a great discouragement to Piety.</HI> Therefore I am now to produce the receiv∣ed and approved Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> concerning <HI>Predestination,</HI> since the Reformation to this Day; and shall begin with the 35 Articles agreed upon in a Con∣vocation held at <HI>London</HI> 1552. in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. and frequently renewed and ra∣tifyed in the following Reigns, and conti∣nued the <HI>established Doctrine</HI> of the Church to this day, which <HI>Dissenters</HI> with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lowed
<PB N="33" REF="002194_0057_0FDACA8019EC7598"/>exceptions subscribe as their <HI>own Do∣ctrine,</HI> as a legal qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lification for our Li∣berty. I wish you would read and consider again the <HI>17th</HI> Article. <HI>Viz.</HI>
<Q><HI>Predestination</HI> to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath constantly de∣creed by his Counsel, secret to us, to de∣liver from curse and damnation, those, whom he hath chosen in Christ Jesus out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting Salvation, as vessels made to honour; wherefore they that be endued with so Excellent a benefit of God, be called according to Gods purpose, by his Spirit working in due season, they thro' Grace obey the calling, they be Justifyed freely, they be made Sons of God by A∣doption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jesus Christ, they walk religiously in good works, and at length by Gods mercy they attain to e∣verlasting felicity. As the Godly consi∣deration of <HI>Predestination,</HI> and our Electi∣in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant and unspeakable comfort to Godly persons, &amp; such as feel in themselves the workings of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high &amp; heavenly things, as well because it doth establish &amp; confirm their Faith of eternal Salvation, to
<PB N="34" REF="002194_0058_0FDACA81998B3AF8"/>be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth frequently kindle their Love to∣wards God, so for curious and carnal per∣sons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes, the sentence of Gods <HI>Predestination,</HI> is a most dange∣rous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either to desperation, or in∣to wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation. Fur∣thermore we must receive Gods promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in the holy Scriptures, and in our doing that will of God is to be followed, which we have expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declared to us in the Word of God.</Q> And as to the sense of this Article, take it from the Learned of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> in his <HI>Cygnia Cantio,</HI> page 16, 17. (Dr. <HI>Bridges</HI> stiles this, <HI>The chiefest Article of the Church in Doctrine.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Thomas Rogers</HI> in his <HI>A∣nalysis,</HI> bound up formerly with the Articles. Dr. <HI>Toysins</HI> in his Commentary on <HI>Lambeth Articles,</HI> fully explain this Article, and raise conclusions from it. 1 That there is a <HI>Predestination</HI> of certain, men to eternal Life; a preterition, predestination, or <HI>Re∣probation</HI> of certain men unto Death. 2. That this <HI>Predestination</HI> is no manifest, no open Decree, into the grounds and causes of which every mean capacity may dive, but a hid∣den purpose, counsel or decree of God, which
<PB N="35" REF="002194_0059_0FDACA8317A3C9D0"/>is kept <HI>secret</HI> from us. 3. That this <HI>Predes∣tination</HI> to life is from <HI>Eternity.</HI> 4. That is altogether <HI>immutable</HI> and unchangeable as God himself This is the established Doct∣rine which all the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> subscribe or assent unto at Ordi∣nation.</P>
<P>The next demonstration and discovery of the Church in this point, is from the <HI>Lam∣beth Articles,</HI> agreed upon at <HI>Lambeth</HI> House, by <HI>John</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury, Richard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> Dr. <HI>Tindall</HI> Dean of <HI>Elie,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> professor of Divinity at <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> with several learned Divines of the Church; with the approbation of <HI>Matthew,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> composed at first in Latin, and sent to the University at <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> to prevent and crush some <HI>Arminian</HI> Controversies that were beginning to be raised there; yet I shall give you in English Four of Nine, that relate to <HI>Predestination,</HI> never yet impeached or rejected by the Church, as inconsistent with the 39 Arti∣cles, but inserted in the <HI>Ireland</HI> Articles, &amp; allowed of in the conference at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court. 1. <HI>God from Eternity hath</HI> Predesti∣nated <HI>certain men unto Life, certain men he hath Predestinated, or reprobated unto Death:</HI> 2. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>moving and efficient cause of</HI> Pre∣destination <HI>unto Life, is not the fore-sight of Faith or Perseverance, or good works, or of any thing in the persons</HI> Predestinated,
<PB N="36" REF="002194_0060_0FDACA84B8502728"/><HI>but only in the good will and pleasure of God.</HI> 3. There <HI>is a</HI> Predestinate number <HI>of Predestinate, which can neither be augment∣ed nor diminished.</HI> 4. Those <HI>who are not Predestinated unto Salvation are necessarily damned for their Sins.</HI> This is more plain and particular, than any thing I have heard taught by <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and yet it is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Testimony from that Church for <HI>Predestination,</HI> is the Articles of <HI>Ireland,</HI> agreed upon by the Arch-bishops, Bishops, and the Clergy of that Kingdom, in a Con∣vocation held at <HI>Dublin,</HI> 1615. And seeing they were <HI>English Divines,</HI> and a part of the <HI>English Church,</HI> under one King, they were received, approved and licensed by the Government, as agreeable to the 39 Articles, and also those of <HI>Lambeth;</HI> there∣fore I shall record out of them what con∣cerns <HI>Predestination,</HI> or the <HI>Decrees</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Art. 11. <HI>God from all eternity, did by his unchangeable Counsel, ordain whatsoever in time should come to pass, yet so as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the reasonable Creatures, and neither the</HI> Liberty <HI>nor</HI> Con∣tingency <HI>of</HI> Second causes <HI>is taken away, but established rather.</HI></P>
<P>Art. 12. <HI>By the same eternal Counsel, God hath</HI> Predestinated <HI>some unto Life, and</HI> Re∣probated <HI>some unto Death, of both which there is a certain number known only to
<PB N="37" REF="002194_0061_0FDACA861B5CA380"/>God, which can neither be encreased nor di∣minished.</HI></P>
<P>13. Predestination unto Life, <HI>is the e∣verlasting purpose of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath constantly decreed in his Secret Counsel, to deliver from curse and damnation, those whom he hath chosen in Christ, out of man∣kind, and to bring them by Christ, to ever∣lasting Salvation, as vessels made unto ho∣nour.</HI></P>
<P>14. <HI>The cause moving God to</HI> Predestinate, <HI>is not the fore-seeing of Faith, or Perseve∣rance, or Good Works, or of any thing in the persons Predestinated, but only the good pleasure of God himself, for all things being ordained for the manifestation of his Glory, and his Glory being to appear, both in the works of his Mercy and Justice, it seemed good unto his heavenly wisdom, to choose out a certain number toward whom he would extend his undeserved Mercy, leaving the rest to be Spectacles of his Justice.</HI></P>
<P>15. <HI>Such as are</HI> Predestinated <HI>unto Life, be called according to Gods purpose, his Spi∣rit working in due season, and thro' Grace they obey the calling, they be Justified free∣ly, they be made Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jesus Christ, they walk religiously in good Works, and at length by God's Mercy they attain to everlasting felicity; but such as
<PB N="38" REF="002194_0062_0FDACA8797C674D0"/>are not</HI> Predestinated <HI>to Salvation, shall final¦ly be condemned for their Sins.</HI></P>
<P>16.
<Q>The Godly consideration of <HI>Pre¦destination,</HI> and our <HI>Election</HI> in Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to Godly persons, and such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feel in themselves the workings of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high &amp; heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly confirm and establish their faith, of eternal Salvation, to be enjoyed thro' Christ, as because it doth fervently kin∣dle their Love towards God; and on the contrary side for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their Eyes, the Sentence of Gods <HI>Predestination,</HI> is very dangerous.</Q> This is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of Ireland,</HI> and so exactly agreea∣ble to the 39 Articles, and those of <HI>Lam∣beth,</HI> that I need say no more of them.</P>
<P>Another discovery of the Doctrine of <HI>Predestination,</HI> is from the Suffrages of the <HI>five Representatives</HI> of the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> at the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> Dr. <HI>Carleton</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chichester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Samuel Ward,</HI> publick Divinity professor at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bal∣canquel</HI> Dean of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Thomas Goad,</HI> who were called and assembled to
<PB N="39" REF="002194_0063_0FDACA8918F19308"/>nip <HI>Arminianism</HI> in the bud: and they be∣ing Commissionated and sent by the Su∣pream Authority in the Nation; their Suf∣frages as recorded in the publick Acts of that Synod, and by Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> in his <HI>Suffra∣gium Britannorum,</HI> are to be found, and were then received and approved, as the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And should it not appear a wonder, and be a surprize to the <HI>hearers,</HI> tho' the <HI>Preachers</HI> cannot be Ignorant of it, that the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> the ordinary and universal Book of their Devotion should give its Suf∣frage, and bear its testimony for <HI>Predestina∣tion,</HI> or <HI>Election,</HI> which upon a more strict observation all shall find? In the Collect for <HI>All Saints Day,</HI> it begins, <HI>Almighty God, who hast knit together thine</HI> Elect <HI>in one com∣munion, and fellowship in the mystical Body of Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI> If God has an <HI>Elect∣ed</HI> people, there must some be <HI>left out,</HI> and <HI>passed by,</HI> otherwise there can be no <HI>Election,</HI> or <HI>Choice.</HI> In the <HI>Catechism</HI> generally taught unto Children, in Answer to Q 6. It is re∣plied in the third place, <HI>In God the Holy Ghost, who Sanctifyed me, and all the Elect, people of God;</HI> which plainly instructs us, that God <HI>chooseth</HI> to <HI>Sanctification,</HI> and holi∣ness as well as to <HI>Salvation,</HI> and that all <HI>E∣lect ones</HI> shall be <HI>Sanctifyed,</HI> and consequent∣ly <HI>Saved.</HI> In the <HI>burial of the Dead,</HI> in the first prayer after the <HI>Lords Prayer; Be∣seeching
<PB N="40" REF="002194_0064_0FDACA8A98983420"/>thee, that it may please thee of thy gracious Goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine</HI> Elect. Here is not only an <HI>Elect,</HI> but a definite and certain <HI>Number</HI> determined with God, which are not <HI>yet accomplished,</HI> and the number of such as are left out and passed by, is also certain and determined. In a <HI>Godly prayer at all times,</HI> which is added to some old Bibles, there is this passage; <HI>In that it hath pleased thee freely, and of thine own accord, to</HI> Elect <HI>and choose us to Salvation before the beginning of the World.</HI> This is plain language, and in the Books of <HI>Devotion,</HI> and even those who little thought <HI>Common Prayer</HI> favoured <HI>Pre∣destination,</HI> which they oft called a <HI>Damna∣ble Doctrine,</HI> and is so particular, for a <HI>Do∣ctrine</HI> some of your Neighbours have assert∣ed, <HI>contrary to the Word of God, and a great discouragement to Piety;</HI> so that I wonder how the <HI>Oxford Oath</HI> of <HI>Assent and Consent</HI> shall relish for the future, wherein men Swear, <HI>That nothing is contained in the Book of Cannons, Ordination of Bishops, and Com∣mon Prayer, contrary to the word of God,</HI> see∣ing <HI>Predestination</HI> is found in one of them.</P>
<P>We call in also to witness for us, the <HI>Ho∣milies</HI> of the Church, which appear to be principally the established Doctrine thereof, for the most part composed by the Arch-bishop <HI>Cranmer,</HI> who sealed among many more, this and other truths, with his Blood.

<Q>God of his mercy, and special favour, towards them whom he hath appointed to everlasting Salvation, hath so offered his Grace especially, and they have so received it fruitfully, that al∣tho, by reason of their sinful living out∣wardly, they seemed before to have been the children of wrath and perdition, yet now the Spirit of God mightily working in them unto the obedience of Gods will, that they are the undoubted Children of God, appointed unto everlasting Life: for the Good fruit is not the cause the tree is good: for the tree must first be made good, before it can bring forth good fruit.</Q> This and much more may be found in both parts for confirmation of this Doctrine of <HI>Predestination.</HI></P>
<P>I refer you also to a <HI>Church of England Catechism,</HI> enjoyned by King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. to all School-masters, for instruction of Children throughout the Kingdom, wherein it is as∣serted,
<Q>That the faithful were sore chosen, <HI>Predestinated,</HI> and appointed to everlasting life, before the World was made, and that the cause of our Justification, and Salvation, is the goodness and love of God, whereby he chose us, before he made the World.</Q></P>

I cannot omit certain Questions and An∣swers concerning <HI>Predestination,</HI> published by <HI>Robert Parker,</HI> and continued to be bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with your Bibles, until the Year 1615. I shall give you a hint thereof, in two or three Questions, relating to <HI>Predestination. Q.</HI>
<Q>Are not all <HI>ordained to Eternal Life. A.</HI> Some are <HI>Vessels of Wrath,</HI> ordained to Destructi∣on, as others are <HI>Vessels of Mercy,</HI> prepa∣red for Glory.</Q> Q. <HI>How standeth it with God's</HI> Justice, <HI>that some are appointed to Damnation? A.</HI> Very well, because all men have in themselves Sin, which deserveth no less, and therefore the mercy of God is wonderful, in that he Vouched to save some of that sinful race, and to bring them to the knowledge of the Truth. Q. <HI>But how shall I know I am ordained to Eternal Life?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the motions of Spiritual Life, which belongeth only to the Children of God.

Q. <HI>What are the parts of Predestination? A.</HI> Election and Reproba∣tion. Q. <HI>What is Election? A.</HI> 'Tis the everlasting Predestination, or fore-appoint∣ment

A.</HI> It is the eternal fore-ap∣pointment of certain Angels and men unto everlasting Dishonour and Destruction, God of his own free-will determining to pass them by, refuse and cast them off, and for sin condemn and punish them, with eternal Death. And to these you may add most <HI>Church of England</HI> Books common among us; as also that common Book almost in every Fami∣ly, <HI>The Practice of Piety.</HI> So it is to be ho∣ped you will not adventure to say, the <HI>Church of Scotland</HI> holds any other <HI>Predesti∣nation,</HI> than what is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> or that it is <HI>contrary to the Word of God, and a great discourage∣ment to Piety.</HI></P>

To show the Ignorance of the Author, in Voting it out for a <HI>Noval</HI> Doctrine. And here again, I shall freely own my self be∣holden to <HI>Monsieur Pictet,</HI> Professor of Di∣vinity in the Academy of <HI>Geneva</HI> (if our

For the short <HI>History of Pre∣destination,</HI> which I now present to the Rea∣der, as also for many of the Quotations from Ancient Writers, which I take from him, except some which I collected from the Writers themselves.—Says <HI>Monsieur Pictet.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>C'est fort bien, remarque que dans les Disputes touchant la</HI> Grace, <HI>la</HI> Election, and <HI>la</HI> Predestination, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Which I shall for the Benefit of <HI>English</HI> Readers translate.</P>
<P><Q>We must note, that less Regard is to be paid to the Ancient Fathers, who pre∣ceeded <HI>Austin,</HI> and lived before the Time of the Rise of the <HI>Heresy</HI> of <HI>Pelagius;</HI> I say, less Regard is to be paid to them in our Disputes of <HI>Predestination,</HI> and <HI>Free Grace,</HI> than to those who lived afterwards; because that these latter have searched the Matter with more Care and Exactness. <HI>Every new Sect of</HI> Hereticks (saith St. <HI>Au∣stin) which spring up in the Church, by the Disputes, which they are the unhappy Instru∣ments of raising in the Church, have given Oc∣casion to others to illustrate and confirm, with a greater particularity, those Truths of Scrip∣ture, which they find thus attacked</HI> The Fathers, when they had it in Hand to dis∣pute with the <HI>Manichees,</HI> were too apt in Opposition to them, to extol the Powers of <HI>Free-Will;</HI> nevertheless, most of them favoured the Truths which we defend;
<PB N="45" REF="002194_0069_0FDACA925C5259D8"/>and they have said many Things in opposi∣tion to the Error which we oppose.</Q></P>
<P><HI>But without being at the pains to consult the Sentiments of the Fathers, who lived before</HI> Pelagius; <HI>we shall make a search af∣ter that which the Church held and main∣tained, when that</HI> Heretick <HI>first arose to infest the Churches, and what was the Be∣lief of those who followed them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It appears from the Works of St.</HI> Austin, <HI>that there were</HI> three <HI>distinct Systems of</HI> Predestination, <HI>in the Time of that ancient Doctor of the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> first <HI>was that of St.</HI> Austin <HI>and the Church, which gives</HI> all to God. <HI>The</HI> Se∣cond <HI>is that of</HI> Pelagius, <HI>who attributes</HI> all to Man. <HI>The</HI> Third <HI>is that of the</HI> Semi-Pelagians, <HI>who divided it between</HI> God &amp; Man, <HI>attributing</HI> Part to God, and Part to Man; <HI>but attributing</HI> more <HI>to</HI> Man <HI>than to</HI> God. <HI>The</HI> Pelagians <HI>founded the</HI> Predestination, <HI>or rather the</HI> Election <HI>of God upon the</HI> Fore-sight of the Merit <HI>of Man. The</HI> Semi-Pelagians, <HI>upon the Consi∣deration that</HI> Grace <HI>is necessary to all the actions of Piety, they attributed it to the</HI> Free-Will <HI>of Man, only the</HI> beginning and first Essays <HI>toward Faith; and they believed that</HI> Predestination <HI>was founded upon the</HI> Fore-sight of this first Beginning <HI>of Faith, which according to them appertained only to Man; yea, they even asserted, that Chil∣dren
<PB N="46" REF="002194_0070_0FDACA9397D27708"/>dying in their Infancy, were</HI> Predesti∣nated <HI>according as God had</HI> fore-seen <HI>they would have lived, in Case they had lived a longer Time in the World.</HI></P>
<P><Q>They distinguished also the <HI>Decrees</HI> of God into <HI>two sorts,</HI> the one a <HI>general and conditional</HI> Decree of Saving all men; the other a <HI>particular and absolute</HI> Decree, of Saving those whose Faith he <HI>fore-saw from Eternity.</HI> But St. <HI>Austin</HI> with the Church not admitting <HI>any good Disposition</HI> in Man which is not the <HI>Gift of God,</HI> even from the <HI>least beginning of Faith to the End of our Perseverance,</HI> and a Gift purely <HI>gratuitous,</HI> or of <HI>meer Grace,</HI> because it is not done with a view to any <HI>Merit;</HI> but on the contrary 'tis a Gift to Sinners who are un∣worthy thereof, held that <HI>Predestination is wholly of Grace.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Church highly approved the Doct∣rine of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> and thundered her <HI>Ana∣thema's</HI> against <HI>Pelagius,</HI> and the <HI>Semi-Pela∣gians</HI> in many of their <HI>Councils,</HI> and parti∣cularly those which were held at <HI>Carthage</HI> and at <HI>Milevi. Anno</HI> 416, 417, 418. against <HI>Pelagius</HI> and <HI>Celestius.</HI></P>
<P>The Popes <HI>Celestinus</HI> and <HI>Innocent</HI> decla∣red themselves against these Hereticks, and maintained the Doctrine of St. <HI>Austin.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Prosper</HI> largely defended the same a∣mongst the <HI>Gauls.</HI></P>
<P>No less strenuous was Pope <HI>Leo</HI> in the
<PB N="47" REF="002194_0071_0FDACA9517FA9490"/>Defence hereof, as may be seen by one of his Letters; and he authorized all that had been said and done against the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> by the <HI>African Councils</HI> and others; and he made choice of St. <HI>Prosper</HI> himself for his Secretary in this Affair.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Gelasius</HI> signalized himself in the Defence of this Doctor of the <HI>Church,</HI> and made evident how much he esteemed the Book of the <HI>Call of the Gentiles,</HI> placing all the Works of <HI>Cassian</HI> and <HI>Faustus</HI> among the <HI>Apocryphal.</HI> Books, <HI>viz.</HI> those which were not received by the Church.</P>
<P>In the sixth Century, Pope <HI>Hormisda</HI> fell into the same Sentiments, and the Do∣ctrine of St. <HI>Austin</HI> was defended by <HI>John Maxentius,</HI> a Monk and Priest of <HI>Antioch,</HI> by St. <HI>Fulgentius,</HI> by the Bishop of <HI>Arles,</HI> by <HI>Primasius</HI> a Bishop, by <HI>Ferrandus,</HI> Deacon at <HI>Carthage,</HI> by the illustrious Bishops and Confessors, banished for their Faith into <HI>Sardinia,</HI> by the <HI>second</HI> Synod at <HI>Orange,</HI> held in <HI>Anno</HI> 529, and by <HI>Cassidorus,</HI> by <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the ninth Century, there were many who maintained the Doctrine of St. <HI>Austin;</HI> &amp; among others, the famous <HI>Godeschal,</HI> who suffered greatly by the Persecutions of <HI>Hinc∣marus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ram</HI> a Monk taught the Doctrine of the <HI>Predestination of the Elect from free Grace,</HI> in those two Books of the <HI>Predestina∣tion
<PB N="48" REF="002194_0072_0FDACA96986F3FC0"/>of God,</HI> dedicated to the Emperour <HI>Charles,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Calvus.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Prudentius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Troye,</HI> defend∣ed the same Truth, and declared in his Let∣ter to <HI>Hincmarus,</HI> and <HI>Pardulius,</HI> that none of the ancient Doctors had studied with more Exactness and Accuracy than had St. <HI>Austin,</HI> the most hidden Secrets and Myste∣ries of the Scripture, nor that had exami∣ned into them with so much Application, nor had more happily litt upon the Truth, nor had explained them with more Sinceri∣ty, nor had more nicely disentangled the Doctrine of Predestination of its Difficul∣ties; nor that had set himself to unfold them with more Fidelity than he, nor that had defended them with greater strength and force of Reasoning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This same Prelate not being in a Capacity to attend himself at the Ordination of <HI>En∣cas,</HI> chosen Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> dispatched away one of his <HI>Priests</HI> as a Delegate to represent him, with a Letter importing his Consent unto the Ordination of that Bishop; but upon Condition that he should declare by his Subscription, that he held entirely to the Doctrine of the holy Fathers touching <HI>Grace;</HI> and to that of the <HI>Four Chapters</HI> (as they are called) and in <HI>one</HI> of these <HI>Four Chapters,</HI> we have these remarkable Words;
<Q>That we believe &amp; acknowledge, that by a deep and unsearchable Counsel of
<PB N="49" REF="002194_0073_0FDACA9817ACC698"/>Almighty God, there are some who are predestined unto Life before all Time by the entirely free Mercy of God; and that there are others, who by an incomprehen∣sible Justice, are predestinated to Torments.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lupus</HI> Abbot at <HI>Ferrara</HI> in the Diocess of <HI>Seus</HI> writing to <HI>Hincmarus</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> speaks thus
<Q>The Opinion which seems most conformable to the Truth is this; Namely, that with respect to the Good, Predestination is nothing else, ac∣cording to the Mind of the most learned <HI>Austin,</HI> than the <HI>Preparation of Grace;</HI> and with Regard to the Wicked, Predestinati∣on, as well as I can conceive and judge of it, is the substraction of Grace. It is from these last Principles, that this Author very solidly explains the Matter thus;</Q> <HI>God does not afford the succours of his Grace, to those to whom he is not pleased to grant them, according to his</HI> Decree of Predestination; <HI>but yet in such sort, that the Equity of the Creator appears equally in his Conduct to∣wards either, while he</HI> gives <HI>to some his Grace out of meer Mercy, and does</HI> not give <HI>it to others, by a Judgment as righte∣ous as it is hidden. As then we are all equal∣ly fallen into a State of Condemnation; God shews Mercy to whom of us he pleases, and he hardneth also whom he pleases; that is, he leaves them under the Power of their own native hardness. It is thro' infinite Good∣ness
<PB N="50" REF="002194_0074_0FDACA99990AE380"/>that he shews Mercy; but it is without a∣ny Ʋnrighteousness, that he reprobates and har∣dens any,</HI> viz. <HI>that he denies them his Special Grace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lupus Servatus,</HI> Priest at <HI>Mentz,</HI> compo∣sed a Work upon the <HI>three famous Questions,</HI> where he teaches the same Doctrine touch∣ing <HI>Predestination by Free Grace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Florus,</HI> Deacon of the Church at <HI>Lyons,</HI> maintained the same Truth in a Book of his. And so did the Archishop of the same Place defend it with a great deal of Cou∣rage and Light.</P>
<P>The Council of <HI>Valentia</HI> assembled, <HI>Anno</HI> 855. by Order of the Emperor <HI>Lotharius,</HI> clearly established it. <HI>We confess, says he, without Hesitation or Doubt, the</HI> Predestina∣tion of the Elect to Life, <HI>and the</HI> Predesti∣nation of the Ungodly to Death; <HI>always ac∣knowledging and allowing, that in the</HI> Election <HI>of those that are to be Saved, the Mercy of God</HI> precedes <HI>all</HI> Good Merit; <HI>and that on the contrary in the Damnation of those that perish, their</HI> Evil Demerit <HI>does</HI> precede <HI>the just Judgment of God; that God has not by his eternal Predestination determined with him∣self to do any Thing, which is not the Effect either of meer gratuitous Mercy, or most righ∣teous Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Another Council held at <HI>Langres, Anno</HI> 859. in the Presence of King <HI>Charles,</HI> the younger Brother of <HI>Lotharius,</HI> confirmed
<PB N="51" REF="002194_0075_0FDACA9B1A4C77B8"/>the Canons of the Council of <HI>Valentia. Fifteen</HI> Days afterwards they were read o∣ver again, and confirmed in a <HI>Third</HI> Coun∣cil, held at another Place.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the first, confirmed these Canons, as <HI>Prudentius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Troye</HI> in∣forms us in his Annals.</P>
<P><HI>Hincmarus</HI> himself in his Work of <HI>Pre∣destination,</HI> approves that of St. <HI>Augustin;</HI> upon the same Point; and does not blame <HI>Godeschalcus,</HI> only that he supposes, <HI>Hinc∣marus</HI> had departed therefrom.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Eleventh</HI> Century <HI>Anselm,</HI> Arch. Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was a great Disciple of St. <HI>Austin;</HI> as also <HI>Ildebert,</HI> Arch Bishop of <HI>Tours.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Bernard</HI> above all that have been men∣tioned in the XII Centu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, made it appear, that he entirely fell in with the Sentiments of that famous Bishop of <HI>Hippo;</HI> and the Abbot <HI>Gilbert</HI> the Disciple of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> maintained the same Opinions.</P>
<P>An Abbot in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> defended the Doctrine of Predestination, by meer free Grace, in a Work of his, entituled, <HI>The Mirror of Charity;</HI> and makes it appear, that it is a <HI>particular especial Love,</HI> that God had from Eternity for some which he had not for others which makes that Difference between them. They are all equally con∣demned; but he has abandoned the great∣est Number of them unto his Justice; and
<PB N="52" REF="002194_0076_0FDACA9C980A9250"/>it hath pleased him to show Favour to o∣thers; and no one can find Fault with his Will, and accuse it of Injustice.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> the great Angelick Do∣ctor of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, in the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> Century, signalized himself in the Defence of this Doctrine. In his Commentary upon the <HI>Epistle to the Romans</HI> he speaks after this manner.
<Q>As to the Order of <HI>Prescience</HI> and <HI>Predestination,</HI> there are some who say that the Fore-sight of Good and Bad Works, or Merits is the Reason and Cause of Predestination, and Reprobation; In such sort, that we are to conceive and think that God has Predestinated some because he foresaw they would do good Works, and would believe in Carist; and according to that Opinion, the sense of Text of the Apostle is this; Those whom God <HI>foresaw were to be conformed to the I∣mage of his Son, they were the Persons whom he Predestinated.</HI> And it would be reaso∣nable so to phrase it, if Predestination had regard to <HI>nothing else</HI> but to <HI>Life Eternal</HI> bestowed upon us as the Reward of our Works. But Predestination involves and implies in it all those Gifts and Benefits which are profitable in order to Salvation, which God has prepared for Men from all Eternity. Wherefore all that Grace which he distributes to Men, as preparatives to eternal Glory, in Time, he had prepared
<PB N="53" REF="002194_0077_0FDACA9E1A189290"/>for them from Eternity. To establish them, and presuppose upon our Part any Merit, the Fore-knowledge of which is the Cause and Foundation of Predestinati∣on, is the same thing as to say, that <HI>Grace is given to us for the sake of our Merits;</HI> and that the <HI>Principle of our good Works is from our selves,</HI> and only <HI>the consummating and perfecting of our Grace is from God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His whole Commentary upon the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Chapters of the <HI>Epistle to the Romans,</HI> is full of such Reflections.</P>
<P>Nay further, take the Words of Cardinal <HI>Bellarmin</HI> himself, in his Book <HI>of Grace and Free-Will.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Not only says he, have the holy and en∣lightened Fathers of the Church established this Doctrine, but the most ancient and learned among them assure us, that it was <HI>a part of the Faith of the Catholick Church,</HI> and rejected the contrary Opinion, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing the Sentiments of the <HI>Pelagians. To this says he,</HI> we must add the <HI>publick approba∣tion of the Church.</HI> Lastly adds he, it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> once nor twice, nor three times only, that the holy Apostolick Chair has pronounced its Judgment in Favour of the <HI>Defenders of Grace and Predestination</HI> against the rest of the <HI>Pelagians;</HI> so that the Opinions of St <HI>Augustin</HI> cannot any more be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled the Opinion of some Doctors, but the <HI>Faith of the Catholick Church.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002194_0078_0FDACAA29788EAE8"/>
In fine, after the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> which would not decide that Question, there were great Contests between the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> or <HI>Franciscans,</HI> and the <HI>Dominicans</HI> These lat∣ter maintain the Cause of St. <HI>Austin;</HI> &amp; had <HI>Dominicus a Soto</HI> for their Head. The o∣thers maintained the contrary Sentiment, &amp; had for their Head <HI>Andreas Vega.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> strook in of the <HI>Franciscan</HI> side; but not all of them; for <HI>Bellarmine, Pererius, &amp;c.</HI> defended St. <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Thomas Aqui∣nas; Jansenius</HI> too maintained strongly the same Truths, which St. <HI>Austin</HI> had taught.</P>
<P>Thus much may suffice to show, that these Doctrines of <HI>Election, Grace, &amp;c.</HI> are no <HI>Noveltias;</HI> and our Author proves him∣self a bold <HI>Novice</HI> to assert such a Thing with so much Confidence, and so little Rea∣son and Proof. He is not enough acquainted either with the <HI>Fathers</HI> or <HI>Church History</HI> to know what is <HI>Ancient,</HI> and what is <HI>Novel.</HI> I shall therefore for his Information, set down what the learned Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> says up∣on this Head in his <HI>Veritas Redux,</HI> which I am to suspect our Friend had never seen, when he published his <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI> It is very common to such vast Literators as he is, to read Answers to and Censures upon Au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hors, and pass their wise Judgment, before they have seen the Authors themselves.</P>

But still further to stifle this Calumny, (<HI>viz.</HI> Of the pretended Novelty of this Doctrine) &amp; utterly to coufound it, I will more particularly and professedly consider that part of the Cavil which respects the, <HI>Ancient Fathers &amp; Writers</HI> of the Church &amp; which represents them as of a different Judgment from the Followers of <HI>Calvin</HI> in those Doctrins that we have insisted upon. As to what those <HI>Ancients</HI> say concerning these Points, I will give the Reader satis∣faction in these Two Propositions,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Many of the Fathers are not to be relied upon when they speak of these Doctrines.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Several of them, who are the most competent Judges of these Points, do plainly assert and defend them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>First, I will make it evident, That many of the Fathers are not to be relied upon in what they deliver concerning these Articles of Religion. For, First, It is difficult to know their true Sense and Judgment when they speak of these Mat∣ters: And again, when we have found it out, and know what their designed mean∣ing is, we can't rest and confide in it. The former of these is very clear, because in the Times of those who were the most
<PB N="56" REF="002194_0080_0FDACAA11945A678"/>Ancient Fathers of the Church, these Controversies were scarcely started, much less purposely handled, at least but by a few, and so they had not occasion to deli∣ver their Judgments fully concerning these Points. They did not so take them into Consideration as to treat of them distinct∣ly and exactly. They did not discourse of them with an Intention to settle Mens Judgments about them. How then can it be expected that they should speak home to the Point, when they speak on∣ly by the Bye, and as it were Accidental∣ly, and did not make it their Design and Business to treat of those Things? It is observable, that before some of the chief Heresies arose, these Writers were not so express and punctual about those Ar∣ticles of Religion as they were after∣wards. St. <HI>Jerom</HI> confesses that before <HI>Arius</HI>'s Time the Fathers delivered some Things <HI>unadvisedly, and with little heed to what they said; yea, they said such things as can hardly escape the Cavils of perverse M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> And what was thus ob∣served by this learned Father concern∣ing the <HI>Arian</HI> Controversie, is observed likewise concerning the <HI>Pelagian,</HI> by a∣ther
<PB N="57" REF="002194_0081_0FDACAA43877D750"/>Father of the same Character, and particularly he remarks concerning <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> That before <HI>Pelagius</HI> appeared, he was negligent and careless in his Words, when he discoursed of Free-Will and Grace. And what he saith of this Father, may be said of the rest, they did not speak so warily and heedfully as afterwards; and accordingly several Points were in those Times unsettled, and not fully determined such as those that I have been handling, and therefore to quote the generality of the <HI>Fathers</HI> upon this occasion is impossible, and to expect it to be done is idle and impertinent.</P>
<P>There are other Reasons why we should not look upon some of the <HI>Fathers</HI> as good Judges here. For it was usual with them to set down other Mens Say∣ings and Opinions as their own. <HI>Jerom</HI> observes of <HI>Origen, Eusebius,</HI> and others, that they sometimes write not their own Sentiments, but speak what others had delivered. Yea, somtimes they said not what they thought, but what the present Occasion compelled them to say, with respect to the diversity of <HI>Times</HI> or <HI>Persons</HI> they had to do with. With regard to
<PB N="58" REF="002194_0082_0FDACAA59931EBB0"/>which latter, they deliver'd not the same Notions and Sentiments to the Vulgar and to the Learned. Sometimes the Fathers rhetoricate and declame, and then we must not expect that things will be spoken exactly according to Truth. <HI>Jerom</HI> acknowledges concerning <HI>himself,</HI> that in some parts of his Writings he speaks only <HI>Probably,</HI> and like a <HI>Retorician</HI> or <HI>Orator,</HI> for Argument sake; and at other times he is <HI>Dogmatical</HI> and <HI>Serious,</HI> and close to the purpose. But it is hard to tell when he delivers things one way, and when the other. <HI>Basil</HI> saith of <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Neocaesarea,</HI> that he spake sometimes not <HI>dogmatically, but as in the heat of Dispute.</HI> It is usual with some of the Fathers, especially <HI>Chryso∣stom</HI> and his Imitator <HI>Theophylact,</HI> to assert such and such an Opinion, to give such an Interpretation of a Text in Scripture, and then in another place to forget what they had said, and to assert and Interpret in an other way, yea, sometimes a quite con∣trary one. So that it is difficult to know what is the Sense of the Fathers.</P>
<P>And when we know it, we cannot rely on it. For some of the Ancient Writers of the Church were Novices, and being
<PB N="59" REF="002194_0083_0FDACAA717AF52F0"/>but lately admitted into the Christian Communion, were but meanly instructed in the Principles of it. Others of them, tho' of longer standing, were sometimes very extravagant in their expounding of Scripture. They strain and wrest the Text, and venture to add to the Words, or to conceal part of them, to prove the business they have undertaken, and to back the Opinions they have espoused So that no impartial Searcher of Truth will swallow there groundless Interpretations. Nor is it to be forgot that some of the Fathers had been professed <HI>Philosophers,</HI> and thence bro't into Divinity several undue Notions &amp; Principles. Thus tis known that they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Patrons of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> which they call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp; other Names are given it by the Writers of the Church, the same which the <HI>Gentile Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ists</HI> make use of. Some of them intend only that Freedom of Will which I have asserted, that is a voluntary acting without Co-action. And of this parhaps <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> is to be understood in his <HI>Apology</HI> to <HI>Antonius Pius,</HI> where he asserts <HI>Free-will</HI> against <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and uses several Arguments for it. And so doth <HI>Irenaeus</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="002194_0084_0FDACAA8BB454F30"/>in his Fourth Book <HI>against Herisies,</HI> Chap∣ters 71, 72, 76, 77. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his 6th Book of the <HI>Evengelical Preparation,</HI> proves from sundry Topicks, that Man is a <HI>Free-Agent,</HI> and argues against Fatal Necessity. And sometimes the Christian Fathers speak of Free-Will as to common Acts of the Mind, and natural Results of Re∣ligion, which no man of Reason will de∣ny. And it is likely that sometimes they understand it of a Free-Will to Good on∣ly. But it is too apparent, <HI>that</HI> some of them assert, <HI>that</HI> all Persons have an abi∣lity to will either good or ill in Spiritu∣als: They hold, <HI>that</HI> there is a Natural Power in every Man <HI>to will and to do what is acceptable to God.</HI> Therefore it is ob∣served by the <HI>Centuriators</HI> of <HI>Magdeburg, that</HI> no Point of Doctrine began so soon to be obscured and corrupted, as this of the Nature of <HI>Free-Will;</HI> and they quote some of <HI>the Fathers</HI> of <HI>the Second Century</HI> as chargeable with this. So it is acknowledged by <HI>Calvin, that the Greek Fathers</HI> are not of his side in this Point; for they generally held, <HI>that</HI> all Men by Nature have a Free-Will to choose Good in Spiritual and Divine Things.
<PB N="61" REF="002194_0085_0FDACAAA17F295B0"/>And we may certainly gather this from a passage in <HI>Irenaeus, viz.</HI> That it was part of the Heresie of <HI>Saturninus,</HI> that some Persons are born without freedom to do Good; and this Writer argues against it, unless we shall say (as was suggested before) that he speaks of Free-Will only, as it denotes acting without com∣pulsion.</P>
<P>In short, we cannot depend upon the <HI>Fathers,</HI> for they have err'd in many things, and it is endless to particularize. I have done something toward his in an other place. So that if we should grant (as perhaps we safely may) that most of the <HI>Greek Fathers</HI> had other Notions of God's <HI>Decrees, Free-Will, Grace,</HI> &amp;c. than I have offered, yet this is no Rule to us, unless we could prove that their Writings are void of Mistakes and Errors. This can∣not be done, and no Wise Man expects it. Yea, we know that many Points in Religion have been taught heretofore by the Fathers, and generally received and applauded, which after-Ages tho't it no immodesty to lay aside and con∣demn. Wherefore let not the <HI>Fathers</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="002194_0086_0FDACAAB9872CDE8"/>and <HI>Antiquity</HI> be pleaded in defence of the Doctrines which I have rejected.</P>
<P>My <HI>Second Proposition,</HI> is this, That these Points which I have been treating of, are plainly asserted and defended by several of the Fathers, even by those of them who were the most competent Judges of them. The <HI>Absolute Predesti∣nation of a cortain number of Persons,</HI> which is tho't by some to be a novel Doctrine, was asserted and defended by St. <HI>Au∣gustine.</HI> Yea, he tells us, that some of the Fathers before him, as well as some that were contemporary with him held the same (tho' they had not occasion to speak of it so directly and plainly) and he quotes Passages out of <HI>Cyprian, Ambrose, Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ianzen,</HI> for this. <HI>Election</HI> without the foresight of good Works, is asserted by St. <HI>Jerom.</HI> And as for <HI>Prosper, Fulgen∣rius, Isidore</HI> of <HI>Sevil, Gregory</HI> the Great, learned Writers in the succeeding Centu∣ries, it is well known that they went this way: Particularly <HI>Prosper</HI> reckons it as the Doctrine of the favourers of <HI>Pelagius,</HI> that <HI>Election was upon foreseen Faith.</HI> And in the same place he mentions it as a∣nother Error of theirs, that they held
<PB N="63" REF="002194_0087_0FDACAAD289C1288"/>the <HI>number of the Elect to be uncertain and undetermin'd.</HI> And <HI>Isidore</HI> expresly asserts a <HI>twofold Predestination,</HI> of the <HI>Elect unto Rest,</HI> of the <HI>Reprobate unto Death.</HI></P>
<P>So the Opinion of several of the Fa∣thers concerning Man's <HI>Free-Will</HI> &amp; God's <HI>Grace,</HI> is the very same that I have main∣tain'd. St. <HI>Basil</HI> in many places of his Writings doth clearly and plainly assert, the absolute Necessity of the <HI>Grace</HI> of the holy Spirit, in order to the performance of good Works, acceptable to God, and he depresses the power of <HI>Free-Will. Gre∣gory Nazianzen</HI> doth in some part imitate him in one of his Poems, the 58th. And as these were the only Men of the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers; so <HI>Cyprian</HI> is the first of all the <HI>Latin</HI> ones, that speaks out concerning the Degeneracy and Infirmity of Man, and the Necessity of Divine and Supernatural Grace. <HI>Lactantius</HI> is the next that plain∣ly owns these, and St. <HI>Augustine</HI> is the next after him, who fully and largely in∣sists upon these Points, and taught others afterwards to do so.</P>
<P>This learned Prelate was as much for <HI>Free-Will</HI> as any Father, as his Books <HI>a∣gainst
<PB N="64" REF="002194_0088_0FDACAAE978414A0"/>the Manichees</HI> testifie; for these Hereticks denying all freedom of humane Actions, and holding that all Sin was by Necessity, this good Father, who wrote against them, professedly asserts and de∣fends the liberty of the Will, and per∣haps somewhat too immoderately in some places, particularly in his Book <HI>De Eccle∣siacticis Dogmatibus.</HI> But when he wrote against the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> part of whose Here fie was, that the Free-Will of Man, is not impair'd by the Fall, but is as sound and perfect as in Innocency, he judiciously settled the Controversie about the Will of Man, maintaining that there is in the Regenerate a Free-Will to Good, and this is supernaturally given them; and in the wicked there is a Free-Will to Evil, and this is naturally in them. He frequently proves and inculcates, that this Faculty in every Man is by nature weak, disabled and enslaved, and that it can't be healed, strengthned, and freed, but by Divine Grace. <HI>What good can lost Man do,</HI> saith he, <HI>but only so far as he is delivered from his Perdition?</HI> Again, <HI>The Will of Man so far free, as it is Freed.</HI> Those words of his in another place con∣tain
<PB REF="002194_0089_0FDACAB020442D78"/>a great part of what he saith on this Head in the rest of his Works, <HI>The Ca∣tholick Faith neither denies Free-Will, nor ascribes so much to it, that it can do any thing without the Grace of God.</HI> But the summ of all is comprised in these words of the same Author, <HI>The Free-Will of Man, as it is now corrupted and captiva∣ted, hath power only to Sin; but when it is set at liberty by God, and assisted by Divine Grace, it hath ability to execute acts of Righ∣teousness.</HI> It is true, (and hath been ob∣served already) that this Father hath in some parts of his Writings, some Passages that favour the contrary Doctrine; but he chang'd his judgment, when he had better considered of the matter, and in his riper years he was resolute and pe∣remptory on the other side, as his Book of <HI>Retractations</HI> plainly shews And it is probable that most of the Fathers, who too much favour'd <HI>Free-Will,</HI> would have delivered their minds differently from what they did, if they had writ their <HI>Re∣tractations.</HI></P>
<P>Not only St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> but St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> was a great and hearty Opposer of the Doctrine of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> as it imports a
<PB REF="002194_0090_0FDACAB19EDF88B0"/>natural Ability in all Men to choose good, without <HI>the</HI> assistance of supernatural Grace In many places of his Writings, he low∣ers the Repute, he depresses the Power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Free-Will,</HI> and magnifies the Power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God in the converting of Sinners. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contends that Man is a free Agent, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> denies that any thing is done to purpose in Religion, without the special Assistance of the Spirit. On those words of Christ, <HI>No man can come unto me, except the Fa∣ther which hath sent me draw him;</HI> he thus Comments, [When he thus speaks, he breaks and destroys the proud Liberty of Man's Will; which if it would go to Christ, it desires it in vain, and endeavours it to no purpose, unless that be done which follows, <HI>except my heavenly Father draw him.</HI> And here likewise this is to be taken notice of That he who is drawn doth not run of his own accord, but is brought on with reluctancy, and is slow and unwilling] Thus he.</P>
<P><HI>Prosper</HI> of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> who writ <HI>of Grace and Free-Will,</HI> tho' he owns the latter, yet requires the former, as absolutely neces∣sary to the producing of any good Work. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Fathers, but great
<PB N="67" REF="002194_0091_0FDACAB318354018"/>numbers of them, assembled in <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Synods</HI> (on purpose to condemn the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Errors) assert the natural Im∣potency of all Mankind, and the Necessi∣ty of Supernatural Grace; and hold, <HI>that</HI> we can't by the Power of <HI>Free-Will</HI> do a∣any good. The substance of all <HI>that</HI> was said in those Assemblies on this Head, is summ'd up in the second Council of <HI>Mi∣levi</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> wherein the Bishops hear∣tily concurr'd against the whole Body of <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> having now an opportunity to declare their Judgments. Whence we may partly guess, that even before <HI>Pela∣gius,</HI> the Fathers were against the Doct∣rine maintain'd by him, tho' they had not <HI>occasion</HI> to shew their Sentiments.</P>
<P>Thus have we shown what is the True Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England</HI> respect∣ing <HI>Predestination.</HI> Let <HI>Calvin</HI>'s System be true or false, we are not disputing that Point at present with our <HI>Choice Dialogist;</HI> but only we assert and prove, that <HI>Calvin's</HI> Doctrine is the true ancient and primitive Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> is therefore much more sincere (tho' an <HI>Heretic</HI>) then are many of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> when he condemns the Articles of <HI>Predestination,</HI> &amp;c. as Heterodox and would have the Church put in others
<PB N="68" REF="002194_0092_0FDACAB49872BE48"/>in their Room; while others of that Church damn the Opinions of <HI>John Calvin,</HI> and yet subcribe to them in their own Articles. I will venture to say, that no Articles can be more <HI>Calvinistical</HI> than some of the <HI>Thirty∣nine.</HI> They are expressed in strong, good, and clear Language, without the least Shadow of an Equivocation; and are pure <HI>Calvinism.</HI> They cannot have any other Construction put upon them without affixing new Ideas to the Words in which they are set down, different from the received Signification of them amongst all <HI>Englishmen.</HI> If they are not <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> let us throw our Language aside, and agree upon new Words and Syl∣lables! Nay, I dare affirm it, had it happened that those Aricles had been otherwise word∣ed; and had it happened that <HI>John Calvin</HI> had let drop the Expressions of their <HI>Tenth, Thirteenth,</HI> and <HI>Seventeenth</HI> Articles, as they now stand, they would have voted them a gross Heterodoxy. For observe, these Men do notoriously abuse the 17th Article of <HI>Predest∣ination.</HI> The Article says plainly, <HI>Predest∣ination to Life is the</HI> eternal <HI>Purpose, whereby (before the Foundations of the World) he hath constantly decreed by his Counsel,</HI> secret <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to deliver from Curse and Damnation, these whom he hath chosen in Christ</HI> out of <HI>Mankind.</HI> Oberve here (1) The Deccree is <HI>Eternal.</HI> (2) It is <HI>immutable,</HI> and impossibly of a Fruitration. <HI>He hath</HI> [constantly] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="69" REF="002194_0093_0FDACAB617A98E60"/><HI>by his Counsel.</HI> That is, not only are the <HI>Blessings</HI> laid up in the <HI>Decree of Election,</HI> but the <HI>Persons</HI> who are chosen to this Blessedness, are <HI>constantly</HI> and <HI>immutably</HI> designed and set apart in the Decree. No, but say they, <HI>God has elected</HI> the whole <HI>Race of Adam,</HI> the whole Species. I an∣swer to this, if it be so, then the Saints are not elected from the Number of <HI>Mankind,</HI> if <HI>all Mankind</HI> be elected; But Men are said to be elected with respect to the A∣postate Angels; That is, out of all Ra∣tional &amp; Intelligent Beings God elected the <HI>blessed Angels,</HI> and the whole <HI>Species</HI> of Man∣kind and passed by or reprobated the <HI>Devil's.</HI> But this is not so; the Articles says plain (3) he has constantly decreed by his Counsel, secreet to us, to deliver from Curse and Damnation, those whom he hath chosen in Christ OUT OF MAN∣KIND. They are from all Eternity elected <HI>out of Mankind.</HI> Which plainly intimates a certain definite Number of Persons, and not the whole Race of <HI>Adam.</HI> To say, that God <HI>chose all Mankind out of Mankind,</HI> is Nonsense. Again (4) They are chose <HI>in Christ.</HI> Now if all the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> were chose <HI>in Christ,</HI> in &amp; by whom they are to be saved according to the <HI>constant Counsel</HI> of God, then all Men must be saved.

<P N="3">We may now pass to enumerate some of the many Absurdities and Inconsistances in the <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI> And here it were a Task too great for an <HI>Hercules</HI> to cleanse this more then <HI>Augean Stable,</HI> of the Rubbish of Nonsense. Inconsistent Absurdities, and foul Mistakes. But a few may suffice, and we will conclude this Appendix.</P>
<P>First. The Author is not at all acquainted with the true Doctrine of the <HI>Stoics</HI> concern∣ing Fate, when he calls the <HI>Calvinisticl Doctrine of Predestination,</HI> a <HI>Stoical and Fatal Scheme.</HI> The <HI>Divine Pre-ordinaion</HI> of all Events from the beginning to the End of Time, is entirely inconsis∣tent with <HI>Stoical Fate.</HI> Yea the very notions of <HI>Divine Pre-ordination</HI> is one of its principal Differences from <HI>Fate.</HI> And will appear, if we consider what is <HI>Fate.</HI> Now altho', according to <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Book [<HI>De Fato</HI>] and according to <HI>Justus Lipsius</HI> in his [<HI>Physiologia Stoicorum</HI>] and according to <HI>Mon∣sieur Danet</HI> in his [<HI>Dictionary of the Greek and Roman Antiquities,</HI> compiled for the use of the <HI>Dauphin</HI>] and others do mention several different Opinions of the <HI>Stoics</HI> as to the true Doctrine of <HI>Fate,</HI> yet the most re∣ceived Notion thereof was to this Purpose; viz <HI>Fate is a certain blind and inevitable, in∣violable and necessary Chain of Causes and
<PB N="71" REF="002194_0095_0FDACAB91CFF1498"/>effects whereby all Things and Events of Ne∣cessity come to pass, and which Jupiter himself the great God of all cannot alter.</HI> So that <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself did not <HI>fore-ordain</HI> all Things and Events. It is a <HI>blind Fate,</HI> consisting in the Eternal Necessity of the Things them∣selves; and not dependent upon the Will of <HI>Jove. Jupiter</HI> indeed may <HI>foreknow</HI> all Events, but then it is by Reason of his Knowledge in examining and inspecting those Eternal Rolls of Destiny. The <HI>Fates</HI> are sure and firm, &amp; determinate antecedent to any Preordination of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> For there is a Difference between a bare Theorical Science, or Prescience, &amp; a Pre-ordination. Thus I know there will be a Day of Judgment; but it will not arrive any whit the more for my knowing of it. Thus <HI>Jove</HI> foreknows all Events (according to the <HI>Stoics</HI>) but has not appointed them. <HI>Jove</HI> foreknows all Events because they will come to pass; but they do not come to pass because he fore∣knows them. For had there been no <HI>Jupiter</HI> the <HI>Fates,</HI> which are founded upon the Ne∣cessity of the Things in their various necessa∣ry Combinations, would have been, and Events have followed. I shall quote a few Authorities and dismiss the Subject. <HI>Herodo∣tus</HI> says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c. Destinatam sortem nee D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o effugere fas est. Philemon</HI> the Poet, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Sunt Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bus Servi, Rex Servus est Deo, Deus N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessitati.</HI> And that <HI>Jupiter</HI> is
<PB N="72" REF="002194_0096_0FDACABA9898D060"/>not the Ordainer of the <HI>Fates</HI> appears from these Words of <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> Lib. 15.</P>
<P><HI>Invenies illic incisa Adamante perenni Fata tui Generis: Legi ipse animoque notavi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI> is there introduced speaking to <HI>Venus</HI> telling her it is to no Purpose to at∣tempt to break the Decrees of the Three <HI>Parcae.</HI> And then he adds, <HI>I have observed and read their Decrees. Jupiter</HI> had no Hand in Ordaining them, but comes to the Know∣ledge of them by Inspection into the Rolls of Destiny.</P>
<P>But I conclude this with a Passage out of that great Poet our <HI>English Virgil,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Dryden.</HI> It is in his Dedication, of the <HI>Eneis</HI> to the <HI>Marquess of Normandy,</HI> who was also a great Poet. Speaking of <HI>Jupiter's</HI> Power to defer the Blow, that is to defer the Death of those, for whose Continu∣ance in Life he had received strong Petitions, and ardent Supplications, He says,
<Q>I once occasionally discoursed with that Excellent Person Sr. <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> who is better conversant than any Man I know, in the Doctrine of the <HI>Stoics,</HI> and he set me right, from this concurrent Testimony of Phylo∣sophers &amp; Poets, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> could not <HI>retard the Effects of Fate,</HI> even for a Mo∣ment. For when I cited <HI>Virgil,</HI> as favouring the Contrary Opinion in that Verse, <HI>Tolle fuga Turnum atque instantibus cripe</HI> Fatis.
<PB N="73" REF="002194_0097_0FDACABC177BDF10"/>He replyed, and I think with exact Judg∣ment, that when <HI>Jupiter</HI> gave <HI>Juno</HI> leave to withdraw <HI>Turnus</HI> from the present Danger, it was because he foreknew, that his <HI>Fatal Hour</HI> was not come; That it was in <HI>Destiny,</HI> for <HI>Juno</HI> at that Time to save him; And that <HI>Himself,</HI> viz. <HI>Juptter,</HI> obeyed <HI>Destiny,</HI> in giving her, tha leave.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we see that <HI>Blind Fate,</HI> and <HI>Calvin∣nistical Predestination</HI> are intirely opposite; inasmuch as the former is not subject to God himself; but this latter supposes an holy, and righteous, wise, and Powerful Providence of God, who did himself or∣dain these Events. So much for <HI>Fate.</HI></P>
<P>Another Blunder of the Dialogist is, that uis Notion of the <HI>Presentiation</HI> of all Things in the <HI>Divine Mind,</HI> destroys and overthrows all the rest of his Talk. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Things, which shall be done to the End of all Time, are present in <HI>Idea</HI> with God, no <HI>Fate</HI> can be surer and more ne∣cessary. Every Motion of Man, and eve∣ry act of Volition, and every Sin, and e∣very good Act is now present in the Di∣vine Mind. And might not we reply a greeable to his Answers to <HI>Calvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> what I will, I do no more than is al∣ready present with God; My Will is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣sitated
<PB N="74" REF="002194_0098_0FDACABD9DA0CEF0"/> to this or that Thing, for it is all with God, as much as if I had already done it.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, he blunders prodigiously in confounding the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Things decreed in the Divine Mind, with the Things themselves in their actual or eventual <HI>Ex∣istence.</HI> All Things are present with God, there is no <HI>Fore</HI> and <HI>After</HI> with God. We all acknowledge, that God Exists in the most perfect and incomprehensible Man∣ner, he is Being it self [<HI>I am,</HI> that <HI>I am</HI>] and so endures no succession properly speaking, <HI>viz.</HI> no Succession which im∣plies any Thing of Frailty or Change, which is to us inconceivable. Tho' Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI> professes he cannot understand the meaning of an Eternal <HI>Nunc Stans,</HI> (as the School-men phrase it.) But we allow all Things present with God; yet we know they are successive with us. And how does this knock off the Fetters of Necessity from <HI>Free will?</HI> If they be all present with God, and he beholds them with one intuitive View, what help is that to me? What God knows of me will prove true in the Event. And tho' all Things are present with God, they are so only in <HI>Idea.</HI> For what I shall do on the morrow, God knows; but God does not know (to speak with humble Reverence) what I shall do to morrow under the
<PB N="75" REF="002194_0099_0FDC6AE5F46014C0"/>Notion of a Thing actually accomplished. God therefore knows, this and that will be; but he does not know it as <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> until it be done. I am sure, the Actions to be performed by <HI>John</HI> or <HI>James</HI> next Week, are not as yet performed. Unless you'll break thro' your own glori∣rious Maxim, <HI>a Thing can't he, and not be at the same Time.</HI> God did not in, or from Eternity, know all Mankind <HI>actually born,</HI> but he knew they should be born. Thus we see this acute <HI>Metaphysician</HI> is so clumsy as to confound the <HI>Idea's</HI> of Things Decreed with the Things them∣selves, actually Existing.</P>
<P>But I must not Tire the Reader to ob∣serve all the Inconsistences, of one, who is himself giddy, by reason of a rapid Motion of his Brains; and is sometimes an <HI>Armini∣an,</HI> sometimes a <HI>Pelagian,</HI> and sometimes a <HI>Calvinist.</HI> His Motion is very much like that of the Planets, sometimes <HI>Direct,</HI> and then <HI>Retrograde;</HI> and sometimes, I profess he is <HI>Stationary.</HI> And this last is, when he speaks nothing of <HI>Predestination</HI> at all, as may be observed in some Paragraphs of his Dra∣logues.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with these two Remarks.</P>
<P>First, He accurately and nicely observes,
<PB N="76" REF="002194_0100_0FDBB9CB60477168"/>that the <HI>Church of England</HI> mentions <HI>not a word of Reprobation</HI> in all the 17th Article of <HI>Predestination,</HI> nothing of God's having <HI>Fore-decreed</HI> any to <HI>Misery,</HI> but it speaks only of those, whom he has <HI>Elected to Sal∣vation.</HI> What an unmerciful Piece of Non∣sense is this! The Article says plainly, as we remarked before, that there are some <HI>Chosen out of Mankind.</HI> And so our Author would argue, there are none, which are not <HI>Chosen.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Friend, should I tell thee, there are Twenty Men now before me, and I choose Ten of them to Work for me; it follows (does it not?) that all the Twenty la∣bour for me, because I make no Mention of the Ten, I pass by in my Election, whom I don't choose for the Employ. <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation</HI> are <HI>Relative</HI> Terms; if a Person chooses out of any Number of Things, he likewise refuses some of that Number.</P>
<P>Secondly. He is extreamly ignorant of the <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Tenets. Says he, <HI>Election is with them a Secret Decree, without any Re∣spect to our Works.</HI> Do but observe either the Ignorance, or the Fallacy of our Dialo∣gist. He would insinuate, that we throw our selves upon the Decree of God, and let what will come of Good Works. No,
<PB N="77" REF="002194_0101_0FDBB9BC4B0968B0"/>Sir, <HI>Election</HI> is without any <HI>Prevision,</HI> or antecedent Respect to Good Works; yet no Man shall be S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved without good Works. For he that ordained us to Life, ordained us to all the Preparatives hereof, one of which a <HI>continuance in the Way of Well do∣ing.</HI> In the Decree of God we must not separate the <HI>End</HI> from the <HI>Means.</HI> Both are equally parts of the Decree. God did not choose us because he foresaw we should be holy, but chose us that we might be holy. Holiness is not the <HI>procuring Cause,</HI> but the <HI>Effect</HI> of the Decree. Ephes. 1.4. <HI>According as he hath chosen us in him; before the Foundation of the World, that we should be holy and without Blame before him.</HI> So that <HI>Election</HI> is not as he says, a <HI>Secret De∣cree without any Respect to our Works,</HI> if we have respect to what we are <HI>Elected,</HI> even to <HI>holiness,</HI> as well as in the End to <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> And now I may tell Friend Casuist, what the Apostle means when he bids us make our <HI>Calling</HI> and <HI>Election</HI> sure. Says Friend with an haughty Air. <HI>What! Is not the Decree of God sure without us!</HI> Yes, Sir, it is. But perhaps, I are felicitou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to know, If I am in this Decree. The Apostle gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Chain of Salvation, <HI>Whom he fore∣knew, them he predestinated, whom he predes∣tinated, them he also called; whom he called, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e justified, &amp; whom he justified, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> also glorified.</HI> If a man can by self-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣mination
<PB N="78" REF="002194_0102_0FDBB98E67990DF0"/>of his own Heart, and Life, cha∣ritably judge himself a Faithful Servant of God, called out of the World, he may con∣clude he is of the Election of Grace. He may <HI>search and try</HI> himself, according to the Apostles Advice. And there are the Things which do <HI>accompany Salvation,</HI> as the Apo∣stle tells us in another place. We don't therefore in our Examinations begin with the Decree of God; but we begin with our own Souls. We know the <HI>Decree of God is sure;</HI> but we are allowed to try our own Case; yea, commanded in Scripture here∣unto, and hereupon conclude of our Spiritu∣al Estate. If we make our <HI>Calling</HI> sure (that is, if we by Examination find the Kingdom of Grace is established in our Souls, &amp; that we are effectually called into the Fold of Jesus Christ) our <HI>Election</HI> is sure. For whom he <HI>predestinates,</HI> them he also calls. Not but that many make a very bad use of God's Decrees, and neglect their Salvation; and of this the 17 Article makes mention, and well cautions against such a Destructive Practice. For tho' God has decreed us to Holiness, yet we are to observe his <HI>revealed Will,</HI> which strictly enjoins Holiness &amp; Obe∣dience, to strive after it. We are not Brutes or Machines, what God has ordained us to, we shall by his Grace savingly incline thereunto. And no Man perishes misera∣bly meerly because of his <HI>Impotence to good;</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="002194_0103_0FDBB98FC273F9B8"/>but his natural <HI>Aversation and Enmity to good.</HI> There is no Unconverted Sinner but what hates a Life of Religion, let him in Words profess what he will. He chuses the Path of the Destroyer, and tho' he may do some good Works, yet secretly wishes he had a License to Sin, and yet might be Sa∣ved. So suppose an <HI>Impotence</HI> to good only, and not this Enmity to God and Holiness, is to beg the Question. For to snppose an impotent Penitent crying out, <HI>Lord, I be∣believe, help my Ʋnbelief!</HI> and God refusing his Grace to him, is more than any <HI>Calvi∣nist</HI> will affirm. <HI>Christ will not break the bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax, but will bring forth Judgment to Victory.</HI> But then this sincere and truly Spiritual Desire, is the blessed Effect of <HI>Special Grace</HI> upon the Soul of the Sinner. Which <HI>Special In∣fluences,</HI> that our Dialogist may be favoured with large Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions of them from the God of all Grace, is heartily wished, by him that wrote this Appendix.</P>
