<P>ART. VI. No state, without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled, shall send any embassy to or receive any embassy from, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance, or treaty with, any King, Prince, or state; nor shall any person holding any office of profit or trust under the United States, or any of them, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state; nor shall the United States in Congress assembled, or any of them, grant any title of nobility.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="019349_0012_0FAB45BF704CBF00"/>
<HEAD>THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS Made by the Representatives of the good people of Virginia, assembled in full and free Convention; which rights do pertain to them, and their posterity, as the basis and foundation of Government.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, THAT all men are by nature equally free and in∣dependent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing pro∣perty, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That government is, or ought to be instituted for the com∣mon benefit, protection and security, of the people, nation, or com∣munity, of all the various modes and forms of government that is best, which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is most effectually secured against the danger of mal-administration; and that wherever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the commu∣nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible right, to perform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That no man, or set of men, are intitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in con∣sideration of public services; which, not being descendible, neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislature, or judge, to be the hereditary.</P>
<P N="5">5th. That the Legislative and Executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judicary; and that the members of the two first may be restrained from oppression, by feeling and participating the burthens of the people, they should at fixed periods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be sup∣plied by frequent, certain, and regular elections, in which all, or any part of the former members, to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws shall direct.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="13" REF="019349_0013_0FAB45C116FD6BF8"/>6th. That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in Assembly, ought to be free, and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attach∣ment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented for the pub∣lic good.</P>
<P N="7">7th. That all power of suspending law, or the execution of laws, by any authority without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.</P>
<P N="8">8th. That in all capital or criminal prosecutions, a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, whithout whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself; that no man be deprived of his liberty, except by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="9">9th. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel unusual punishments inflicted.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evi∣dence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="11">11th. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held sacred.</P>
<P N="12">12th. That the freedom of the press is one of the great bul∣warks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by dispotic governments.</P>
<P N="13">13th. That a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that, in all cases, the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>∣ry should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="14">14th. That the people have a right to uniform government; and therefore, that no government separate from, or independent of the government of Virginia, ought to be erected or established within the limits thereof.</P>
<P N="15">15th. That no free government, or the blessing of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adherence to justice, mo¦deration, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recur∣rence to fundimental principles.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="14" REF="019349_0014_0FAB45C1B39667D8"/>16th. That religion, or the duty which we owe to our CREA∣TOR, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity, towards each other.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION OR FORM OF GOVERNMENT Agreed to and resolved upon at a general Convention o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Delegates and Representatives of the several Counties and Corporations of Virginia, held at the Capital in the City of Williamsburg, on Monday the sixth day of May, in the year 1776.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS <HI>George</HI> III. King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> heretofore intrusted with the ex∣ercise of the kingly office in this government, hath indeavoured to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable tyranny, by p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting his negative on laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good:</P>
<P>By denying his Governors permission to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many years.</P>
<P>By refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the person to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right of repre∣sentation in the legislature:</P>
<P>By dissolving legislative Assemblies repeatedly and continually, for opposing with manly firmness, his invasions of the rights of the people:</P>
<P>When dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head:</P>
<P>By endeavouring to prevent the population of our country, and, for that purpose, obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners:</P>
<P>By keeping among us, in times of peace, standing armies and ships of war:</P>
<P>By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffecting to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power:</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="019349_0016_0FAB45C32F674CB8"/>By combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation:</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</P>
<P>For depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever:</P>
<P>By plundering our sons, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns, and destroying the lives of our people:</P>
<P>By inciting insurrection of our fellow subjects, with the allure∣ments of forfeiture and confiscation:</P>
<P>By prompting our negroes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife in arms among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he hath re∣fused us permission to exclude by law:</P>
<P>By endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare as an undis∣tinguished destinction of all ages, sexes, and conditions of existence:</P>
<P>By transporting, at this time, a large army of foreign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation:</P>
<P>By answering our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition of injuries:</P>
<P>And finally, by abandoning the helm <HI>of</HI> government, and de∣claring us out of his allegiance and protection.</P>
<P>By which several acts of misrule, the government of this country, as formerly exercised under the crown of Great-Britain, is TOTAL∣LY DISSOLVED.</P>
<P>We therefore, the Delegates and Representatives of the good people of Virginia, having maturely considered the premises, and viewing with great concern the deplorable condition to which this once happy country must be reduced, unless some regular adequate mode of civil policy is speedily adopted, and in compliance with a recommendation of the General Congress, do ordain and declare the future form of government of Virginia to be as followeth:</P>
<P>The legislative, executive, and judiciary departments, shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of the county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.</P>
<P>The legislative shall be formed of two distinct branches, who, together, shall be a complete legislature. They shall meet once or oftener, every year, and shall be called the GENERAL ASSEM∣BLY <HI>of</HI> VIRGINIA.</P>
<P>One of these shall be called the HOUSE <HI>of</HI> DELEGATES, and
<PB N="17" REF="019349_0017_0FAB45C3F06C7048"/>
consist of two representatives to be chosen for each county, and for the district of West Augusta, annuall, of such men as actually re∣sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in and are freeholders, or duly qualified according to law, and also one Delegate or Representative to be chosen annually for the city of Williamsburg, and one for the borough of Norfolk, and a Representative for each of such other cities and boroughs as may hereafter be allowed particular representation by the legislature; but when any city or borough shall so decrease as that the number of persons having right of suffrage therein shall have been for the space of seven years successively, less than half the number of voters in some one county in Virginia, such city or borough thenceforward shall ceas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to send a Delegate or Representative to the Assembly.</P>
<P>The other shall be called the SENATE, and consist of twenty four members, of whom thirteen shall constitute a House to proceed on business, for whose elections the different counties shall be divided into twenty-four districts, and each county of the respective dis∣trict, at the time of the election of its Delegates, shall vote for one Senator, who is actually a resident and freeholder within the dis∣trict, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the sheriff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of each county, within five days at farthest after the last county election in the district, shall meet at some convenient place, and from the place so taken in their res∣pective counties return a Senator the man who shall have the greatest number of votes in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole district. To keep up this Assembly by rotation, the districts shall be equally divided into four classes, and numbered by lot. At the end of one year after the general election, the six members elected by the first division shall be dis∣placed, and the vacancies thereby occasioned supplied from such class or division, by new election, in the manner aforesaid. This rotation shall be applied to each division, according to its number, and continued in due order annually.</P>
<P>The right of suffrage in the election of members of both Houses shall remain as exercised a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present, and each House shall choose its own Speaker, appoint its own officers, settle its own rules of pro∣ceeding, and direct writs of election for supplying intermediate vacancies.</P>

<P>A Governor or Chief Magistrate, shall be chosen annually, by joint ballot of both Houses, to be taken in each House respectively, deposited in the conference room, the boxes examined jointly by a committee of each House, and the numbers severally reported to them, that the appointments may be entered (which shall be the mode of taxing the joint ballot of both Houses in all cases) who shall not continue in that office longer than three years successively,

An adequate but moderate salary, shall be settled on him during his continuance in office; and he shall, with the advice of the Council of State, exercise the executive powers of government according to the laws of this commonwealth; and shall not, under any pretence, exercise any power or prerogative by virtue of any law, statute, or custom of England: But he shall, with the advice of the Council of State, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where the prosecution shall have been carried on by the House of Delegates, or the law shall otherwise particularly direct; in which cases, no reprieve or pardon shall be granted, but by resolve of the House of Delegates.</P>
<P>Either House of the General Assembly may adjourn themselves respectively. The Governor shall not prorogue or adjourn the Assem∣bly during their sitting, nor dissolve them at any time; but he shall, if necessary, either by advice of the Council of State, or on applica∣tion of a majority of the House of Delegates, call them before the time to which they shall stand prorogued or adjourned.</P>
<P>A Privy Council, or Council of State, consisting of eight members, shall be chosen by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, either from their own members or the people at large, to assist in the ad∣ministration of government. They shall annually choose out of their own members, a President, who, in case of the death, inability, or necessary absence of the Governor from the government, shall act as Lieutenant Governor. Four members shall be sufficient to act, and their advice and proceedings shall be entered of record, and signed by the members present (to any part whereof any member may enter his dissent) to be laid before the General Assembly, when called for by them. This Council may appoint their own clerk, who shall have a salary settled by law, and take an oath of secrecy in such matters as he shall be directed by the Board to conceal. A sum of money appropriated to that purpose shall be divided annually among the members in proportion to their attendance; and they shall be incapable, during their continuance in office, of sitting in either House of Assembly. Two members shall be removed by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly at the end of every three years, and be in∣eligible for the three next years. These vacancies, as well as those occasioned by death or incapacity, shall be supplied by new elec∣tions, in the same manner.</P>
<P>The Delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congress shall be chosen annually, or superseded in the mean time by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly.</P>
<P>The present militia officers shall be continued, and vacancies supplied by appointment of the Governor, with the advice of the Privy Council, or recommendations from the respective county courts; but the Governor and Council shall have a power of suspend∣ing any officer and ordering a court martial on complaint of misbe∣havior or inability, or to supply vacancies of officers happening in
