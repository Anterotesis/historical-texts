<Q><BIBL>Prov. 6.11.</BIBL> So shall thy Poverty come, as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIN is the worst of all Evils, it provokes God, and hurts men. Whosoever <HI>Sins against. GOD, wrongs his own Sout.</HI> Sin de∣serves Endless Judgments in the future World, and often procures many mise∣ries in the present Life. And among the miseries of the present life, <HI>pinching Poverty,</HI> mention'd in our Text, is one;
<PB N="2" REF="002083_0004_0FBB8A79F98E2568"/>and it's mention'd as a fruit of <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Laziness.</HI> v. 6. <HI>Go to the Ant thou Sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.</HI> The <HI>Ants</HI> use <HI>diligence,</HI> and observe the <HI>proper time and season</HI> to provide their <HI>food;</HI> herein their example is worthy to be imitated by men. <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>How long wilt thou sleep, O Sluggard?</HI> This is a sharp reproof to the <HI>Lazy</HI> and <HI>Slothful,</HI> who indulge <HI>Sleeping,</HI> when they should be <HI>Working.</HI> Such <HI>lazy</HI> persons are sup∣pos'd to say, as <HI>v.</HI> 10. <HI>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.</HI> No, thinks the <HI>Lazy Drone,</HI> I won't rise yet, I'll lie till the Clock strikes once more; I'll lie a while and take t'other Nap. Thus he indulges himself in sloth, in needless sleep and 'drowziness; when he should be working for a Livelihood. And what's the fruit and issue of such a <HI>lazy Course?</HI> Why, <HI>Pinching Poverty,</HI> as our Text declares: <HI>So shall thy poverty come, as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</HI> Such a <HI>lazy course</HI> tends as directly to bring <HI>pinching poverty,</HI> as a <HI>steady pace</HI> tends to bring a <HI>Traveller</HI> to his <HI>Journeys end.</HI> Yea, to the <HI>lazy</HI> and <HI>slothful,</HI> pinching <HI>distressing want</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002083_0005_0FBB8A7C8702E430"/>will come as an <HI>armed man;</HI> there's <HI>no avoiding, withstanding,</HI> or <HI>resisting</HI> it. The <HI>same words</HI> in our Text, and the preceeding verse, <HI>viz. a little sleep, a little stumber,</HI> &amp;c. are repeated, <HI>Prov.</HI> 24.33, 34.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>There are Sinful Courses, which directly tend to bring persons to miserable, pinching poverty.</Q>
<P>There are <HI>degrees</HI> of <HI>Poverty.</HI> Some are <HI>poor negatively,</HI> that is, they are not rich, have not such <HI>plenty</HI> and <HI>abundance,</HI> as some of their Neighbours have. Yet possibly by God's Blessing on their prudent diligent Labours, they want neither <HI>Food</HI> nor <HI>Raiment</HI> convenient for them.</P>
<P>Again, Others are <HI>very poor,</HI> are not able to provide themselves a <HI>comfortable
<PB N="4" REF="002083_0006_0FBB8A7DC5EEFF48"/>Dwelling,</HI> nor <HI>comfortable Food or Rai∣ment;</HI> but as to what they can do themselves, they're in <HI>pinching flraits, wants, necessities.</HI> 'Tis this sort of <HI>Po∣verty,</HI> that seems to be specially intend∣ed in our Text. This Poverty is very distressing, and too often puts persons on wicked practices. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.9. <HI>Lest I be poor and steal, and take the Name of my God in vain</HI></P>
<P>Again, We may consider, <HI>This Po∣verty is not a Sin, but a misery.</HI> In its self consider'd, <HI>'tis no Sin to be poor.</HI> Though the <HI>Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the air had nests,</HI> yet our Holy Redeemer <HI>had not where to lay his head.</HI> Mat. 8.20. <HI>Tho' he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor.</HI> 2 Cor. 8.9. So the <HI>precious Saints</HI> of God, of whom the world is not worthy; are some∣times <HI>poor in this world,</HI> tho' rich in faith. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.5. They're sometimes <HI>destitute, afflicted, tormented,</HI> (Heb. 11.37.) <HI>naked, and destitute of daily food.</HI> Jam. 2.15. We read of the <HI>poor Saints at</HI> Jerusalem; and of the <HI>necessi∣ty of the Saints.</HI> Rom. 12.13. and 15.26. Yea, it's possible, persons may sometimes come to <HI>pinching poverty;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002083_0007_0FBB8A7F6A6EDE88"/>yet not for any particular, remarkable Sin or fault of their own, that men know of. Consider <HI>Job</HI>'s poverty. It may be in many Instances of Pover∣ty, it may be said as of the man <HI>born blind.</HI> Joh. 9.3. <HI>Neither hath this man sinned, nor his Parents.</HI> That is, no particular, remarkable Sin beyond what all generally are guilty of, has brought the affliction. Their <HI>poverty</HI> may pos∣sibly be occasion'd, by some long <HI>ill∣ness, weakness,</HI> or <HI>lameness</HI> of body; by <HI>Fire</HI> consuming what they had; by <HI>Storms</HI> wasting their Substance by <HI>Sea</HI> or <HI>Land;</HI> or by the <HI>failing</HI> or <HI>falseness</HI> of those who had the main part of their Estates in their hands; or their E∣states may be taken away by <HI>Thieves, Robbers, Pyrates,</HI> open <HI>Enemies,</HI> or <HI>Per∣secutors,</HI> who <HI>spoil them of their Goods. Heb.</HI> 10.34. When Persons are Impo∣verish'd by such ways as these, they are not to be <HI>blam'd</HI> for, but rather pity'd and reliev'd in, their affliction.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding these things, yet very often vicious wicked practices, do evidently and directly bring <HI>pinch∣ing Poverty</HI> on persons; and they well
<PB N="6" REF="002083_0008_0FBB8A80D3025540"/>deserve sharp rebuke for those pra∣ctices. Well,</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What are those sinful Courses, which directly tend to bring persons to miserable pinching Poverty?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I'll mention some.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sloth and Laziness.</HI> This is the <HI>Vice,</HI> which our Text more immedi∣ately refers to. God hath made both our <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Souls,</HI> we should glori∣fie him with both, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. All our powers and abilities, should be imploy'd as God directs. God does not give us <HI>Talents,</HI> to be <HI>wrapt up in a Napkin,</HI> out to be imploy'd in his Service. Our <HI>Hands</HI> were not made, meerly to be folded up in <HI>Sleeping,</HI> but to be imploy'd in <HI>Work∣ing. Adam</HI> while <HI>Innocent,</HI> was put into the <HI>Garden, to dress and keep it. Gen.</HI> 2.15. Note by the way, <HI>Inno∣cence</HI> and <HI>Idleness</HI> can't dwell toge∣ther. If man would have his <HI>Bread,</HI> he must then Work for it in the <HI>sweat of his Brows,</HI> and that as long as he lives, even <HI>till he returns to the Ground.</HI> Gen. 3.19 <HI>The Sun ariseth,
<PB N="7" REF="002083_0009_0FBB8A85E07C2980"/>man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</HI> Psrl. 104.22, 23. The day then, is to be spent in <HI>Labour,</HI> not in <HI>Laziness.</HI> How plain are those words? <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.9. <HI>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work.</HI> Surely then the <HI>slothful</HI> Servant, is a <HI>wicked</HI> Servant. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.26. <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands as we commanded you, that ye may have lack of nothing.</HI> 1 Thes. 4.11, 12. Here's a plain command of God, that persons should <HI>do their own business,</HI> should <HI>work with their own hands,</HI> to supply their <HI>own wants.</HI> 2 Thes. 3.10. <HI>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</HI> Those <HI>who</HI> are unwil∣ling to work, are unworthy to eat. We should <HI>Work</HI> as well as <HI>Pray,</HI> for our <HI>daily bread;</HI> and should be, <HI>not slothful in business, but fervent in spi∣rit, serving the Lord.</HI> Rom. 12.11. Those honest and diligent in lawful business, by God's blessing, common∣ly get a comfortable Support for themselves &amp; theirs; &amp; are also able <HI>to give to him that needeth.</HI> Eph. 4.
<PB N="8" REF="002083_0010_0FBB8A89A0878B90"/>28. But Laziness, Idleness, does as it were directly, naturally, necessarily lead to Poverty. <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.4. <HI>He be∣cometh poor, that dealeth with a slack hand: but the diligent hand maketh rich.</HI> Prov. 20.13. <HI>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with Bread.</HI> Prov. 23.21. <HI>Drowsiness shall cloath a man with rags. By much slothfulness, the building decayeth; and thro' Idle∣ness of the hands, the house droppeth throngh.</HI> Eccles. 10.18. It's plain from the Word of God, from the light of reason, from the natural tendency of second causes, from experience and observation; that Sloth and Idle∣ness tend to bring plaching poverty. Therefore it's very wicked, to be la∣zy and idle; whether persons have <HI>E∣states or not,</HI> they should be diligently imploy'd in some lawful business, tend∣ing to promote the glory of God, and good of Mankind. None should in∣dulge <HI>Idleness,</HI> neither <HI>Rich</HI> nor <HI>Poor, Young</HI> nor <HI>Old, Men</HI> nor <HI>Women,</HI> tho' 'tis not necessary that all should be imploy'd in the same business. God will call all to to an account, how they
<PB N="9" REF="002083_0011_0FBB8A8A886E2848"/>imploy'd their <HI>time</HI> and <HI>abilities,</HI> whe∣ther as he commanded them or not.</P>
<P>A Grave Author (<HI>Durham</HI> on the Commands, <HI>Octavo, p</HI> 341.) says,
<Q>When God giveth men ability of body on mind, it is sad that they should be useful for nothing, nor active in any thing but to Sin, and be snares and reproaches to Christians, and Christi∣an Religion, as all idle persons, bear∣ing the name of Christians, are, who∣ever they be, whether Gentlemen, or others.</Q></P>
<P>Idleness is call'd, <HI>Master omnium vi∣tiorum et Noverca omnium virtutum;</HI> that is, the Mother of all Vices, and the Step-mother of all Vertues.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>Idleness</HI> is a breach of God's Law, it's contrary to the plain Pre∣cepts of Christianity, it dishonours the Christian Religion, provokes God, gra∣tifies the Devil, hurts men as to their Bodies and Souls, their Persons and Fa∣milies; and so hurts the Publick too on various accounts. Yet many in∣dulge Idleness, they are so <HI>lazy</HI> or <HI>proud,</HI> or both, that they won't work. <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Idleness,</HI> were two of the Sins of <HI>Sodom.</HI> Ezek. 16.49. Are there not many, so <HI>poor,</HI> that they <HI>want necessa∣ries;</HI> and yet won't stoop to do this
<PB N="10" REF="002083_0012_0FBB8A8BFB8532A8"/>or that <HI>inferior laborious sort of work,</HI> no, they scorn it? Possibly they'll <HI>Beg</HI> or <HI>Steal,</HI> rather than do it. If their <HI>Particular Trade</HI> fails, possibly they'll think, they have a <HI>warrant</HI> to be <HI>Idle;</HI> and won't turn their hand to other business; or if they can't have their <HI>full price,</HI> they'll rather be Idle than work for <HI>mean Wages</HI> But their Pride and Sloth are abominable to God, and ought to be abhorr'd by men.</P>
<P>So, some are so proud, fond and foo∣lish, that they <HI>won't let their Children go out to Service,</HI> to be us'd to business, earn their Living; no, they'll rather keep 'em at home, or playing in the Streets, training 'em up in <HI>Ignorance, Idleness, Hunger</HI> and <HI>Nakedness.</HI> Are there not too many Instances of this? Some Parents are so <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>fond,</HI> that they had rather their Children, <HI>Daughters</HI> especially, should <HI>want ne∣cessaries' at home;</HI> than <HI>go to Service,</HI> where they might <HI>learn more, be better.</HI> and <HI>live better</HI> on all accounts. Such <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Fondness</HI> are hateful in Pa∣rents; and unspeakably hurtful to their Children. For this bringing up Chil∣dren in <HI>Ignorance, Pride, Idleness,</HI> emi∣nently fits them for the Devil's Ser∣vice; it often leads to <HI>Lying, Stealing,
<PB N="11" REF="002083_0013_0FBB8A8DA2F46CE0"/>Fornication, Drunkenness,</HI> and various sorts of wickedness.</P>
<P>Well, since <HI>Idleness</HI> is thus <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>pernicious,</HI> surely <HI>diligence</HI> in law∣ful business is a <HI>Vertue,</HI> and those ex∣emplary for it, are so far praise-wor∣thy. Prov. 22.29. <HI>Seest thou a man di∣ligent in his business? He shall stand be∣fore Kings, he shall not stand before mean men.</HI> So, those are praise-worthy, who bring up their <HI>Children</HI> in the <HI>good knowledge of Religion,</HI> and <HI>diligently im∣ploy'd in proper business.</HI> For <HI>Children should be train'd up in the way, wherein they should go,</HI> Prov. 22.6. If you would not have them live like lazy, useless Drones when grown up; then don't Educate them so, while they are young.</P>
<P>'Twould also be praise-worthy, to study, contrive, and promote some me∣thods for <HI>Imploying the poor,</HI> even <HI>Men, Women,</HI> and <HI>Children;</HI> that if they want business, they may be set on work, and may <HI>eat their own bread.</HI> 2 Thes. 3.12. It's a better Service to God and men, to <HI>imploy the poor,</HI> that they may <HI>get their own Living</HI> than to supply them by <HI>Alms</HI> in their <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Laziness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Intemperance.</HI> This also is one sinful method, which leads directly to
<PB N="12" REF="002083_0014_0FBB8A8EF9749E40"/>pinching <HI>Poverty.</HI> Alas, how many sorrowful Instances are there, which are plain proof, of this? Inspired <HI>So∣lomon</HI> says, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.20 21. <HI>Be not a∣mongst Wine-bibbers, amongst riotous eat∣ers of flesh. For the Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to poverty.</HI> Prov. 21.17. <HI>He that loveth pleasure, shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oyl, shall not be rich.</HI> When persons will indulge themselves in <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Pastimes,</HI> in <HI>eating and drinking of the best,</HI> the most pleasant and delicious tho' <HI>very costly,</HI> as tho' nothing less would serve their turn; this directly tends to bring pinching poverty. The <HI>Prodigal</HI> Son, <HI>wasted his Substance with riotous living;</HI> and became <HI>so poor,</HI> that he would gladly have filled his belly with <HI>hogs-meat,</HI> if he could, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.13, 16. Persons should <HI>eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness.</HI> Eccles. 10.17. When persons indulge themselves in eating and drinking to excess, this tends to destroy their bo∣dily Health, to waste their Estates, to bring them into pinching straits and wants, to make them unable to provide for themselves and Families unable to pay their Debts, unable to do what they ought to support both Church and
<PB N="13" REF="002083_0015_0FBB8A9523735528"/>State. When they indulge Intempe∣rance, it unfits them to serve either God or men; it commonly dulls, wea∣kens, stupifies their natural abilities, both of body and mind. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4.11. <HI>Whoredom, and Wine, and new wine take away the heart.</HI> What an heap of mis∣chiefs, does this Sin procure? <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.29, 30. <HI>Who hath wo? Who hath contentions? Who hath bablings? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to seek mixt wine.</HI> Alas, no tongue can fully tell, the Sins and mischiefs proceeding from <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> When persons are heated and inflamed with strong drink, how often do they <HI>set their mouths a∣gainst the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth?</HI> Psal. 73.9. How of∣ten do they abound in profane Oaths and Curses? How often do they talk about, and condemn per∣sons and things which don't concern them? How often are they <HI>filthy, un∣clean</HI> in their words and actions. How often do they jangle, quarrel, fight, both give and receive <HI>wounds without cause?</HI> Indeed, numberless are the mis∣chiefs proceeding from Intemperance. It is an old saying, <HI>Plures gula quam
<PB N="14" REF="002083_0016_0FBB8A96CF634908"/>gladio pereunt,</HI> more die by Intempe∣rance, than by War. Drunkards have a <HI>Wo</HI> denounc'd against them by God. <HI>Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine in∣flame them.</HI> Isa. 5.11. Isa. 28.1. <HI>Wo to the Drunkards of</HI> Ephraim! <HI>Drun∣kards shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> (1 Cor 6.9, 10.) therefore their case is <HI>wofub</HI> indeed. Intempe∣rance tends to ruin persons in this World, and damn them eternally in the next; therefore it is unspeakably vile and wicked, for any to indulge themselves in this Vice. Among the Heathen, some have purposely made their <HI>Slaves drunk,</HI> that their <HI>Children</HI> seeing them in that <HI>worse than beastly posture and condition,</HI> might be warn'd and caution'd against the Vice of Drunkenness. As for <HI>Drunkards,</HI> how often is <HI>shameful spuing on them?</HI> Hab. 2.16. It's abominable for any to eat and drink to excess, though possibly they don't do it to that degree, as to set them a <HI>vomiting like Dogs,</HI> or <HI>wal∣lowing like Swine in their own filth.</HI> Isa. 5.22. <HI>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink.</HI> If they have <HI>strung heads,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002083_0017_0FBB8A97F9491D88"/>and can bear much without <HI>reeling</HI> and <HI>staggering;</HI> yet if they drink to excess, more than is for bodily health, then there's a <HI>Wo</HI> from God denounced a∣gainst them; they abuse God's Crea∣tures to gratifie their lusts; <HI>their God is their belly, they glory in their shame.</HI> Some look on <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> as a breach of all the <HI>Ten Commandments;</HI> because it <HI>tends</HI> to make persons break <HI>every one</HI> of them. Since Intemperance is so vile and base, and makes men on some accounts viler than the <HI>beasts;</HI> since it provokes God, and gratifies the Devil; since it hurts the Body, the Credit, the Estates, the Families, the Souls of persons; since it is so, surely it must needs be foolish and sinful, for persons to company together meerly to <HI>tipple,</HI> and trifle away precious time.</P>
<P>Here I might propose a few <HI>Quae∣ries,</HI> Viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is it not vile and wicked, for any (<HI>Town Dwellers</HI> especially) when they have no real business or occasion for it, to get together to <HI>Taverns, Tipling Houses,</HI> and there spend <HI>several hours</HI> together, possibly <HI>whole Evenings,</HI> and till <HI>late at night,</HI> if not <HI>great part of the day</HI> too; I say, is not this vile, shameful, wicked? Surely 'tis. <HI>Taverns</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002083_0018_0FBB8A9A56B9BFC0"/>were not appointed for <HI>Town-Dwellers</HI> to <HI>laze,</HI> and <HI>tipple,</HI> to <HI>sot</HI> and <HI>doze</HI> in; but for <HI>Strangers</HI> and <HI>Cravellers,</HI> who being distant from home, must seek elsewhere for <HI>Lodging, Food</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> that are needful for them. When <HI>Town-Dwellers,</HI> indulge themselves in such a needless <HI>haunting of Taverns;</HI> to me it seems, that their <HI>Consciences are asleep,</HI> (if not <HI>sear'd with an hot iron.</HI> 1 Tim. 4.2.) or misguided and <HI>erroni∣ons,</HI> else they would severely <HI>sting, lash</HI> and <HI>wound</HI> them for such practices. Is this practice, a minding of things that are <HI>true, honest, just, pure, lovely,</HI> and <HI>of good report?</HI> Phil. 4.8. What, is needless <HI>haunting of Taverns</HI> a thing of <HI>good report,</HI> is there any <HI>vertue</HI> or <HI>praise</HI> in it? Is this practice, an <HI>abstaining from all appearance of evil,</HI> as we are commanded to do? 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.22. Do these practices fit persons for the bet∣ter Serving of God or men? Do they bring glory to God, or good to men? Do they bring honour to the Christian Religion; or well-grounded peace to their own Consciences; or due prepa∣redness for Death and Judgment? Sure∣ly no, none of these things. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it not vile, that persons can scarce <HI>make a Bargain, make up Accompts, Pay</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002083_0019_0FBB8A9BCD212CF0"/>or <HI>Receive</HI> a little <HI>Money;</HI> but that they must needs go to a <HI>Tavern,</HI> and Solemnize the Matter as it were, by swallowing down <HI>Strong Drink;</HI> tho' possibly neither the <HI>time of day,</HI> nor <HI>state of their Bodies,</HI> calls for any such thing? Can't <HI>Tradesmen finish</HI> or bring home a <HI>piece of Work,</HI> but must al∣most think themselves wrong'd, if they are not treated with <HI>Strong Drink?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not vile and wicked, for per∣sons to tempt and prompt others to drink <HI>to excess;</HI> and think they can scarce make them <HI>wellcome,</HI> if they don't make them <HI>drunk?</HI> It's criminal to make others (or our selves either) <HI>sick with bottles of wine,</HI> those who are <HI>so,</HI> commonly <HI>Stretch out their hands with Scorners.</HI> Hos. 7.5.

Loudly call for <HI>Prudence, Diligence, Frugality, Good-husbandry;</HI> lest pinching poverty come upon us as one that travelleth, and <HI>distressing want</HI> as an <HI>armed man</HI> that can't be resisted.</P>
<P>To conclude all, let us be chiefly con∣cern'd, that our <HI>Souls</HI> may be well supply'd and <HI>provided for;</HI> for they're of more worth than our Bodies. <HI>What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own Soul, or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI> Mat. 16.26. Let us follow those heavenly counsels and directions. John 6.27. <HI>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which en∣dureth to everlasting life; which the Son of man shall give unto you.</HI> Mat. 6.19, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. <HI>Lay not up for your selves treasures on earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves break thro' and steal: but lay up for your selves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt &amp; where thieves do not break thro' and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your bears be also.</HI> Yea, if we make it our main business to please God, and lay up treasures in heaven; this in general is the best way we can take, to escape even pinching poverty on earth. For <HI>godliness is profitable for all things having the pro∣mise of the life that now is &amp; of that which is to come.</HI> a Tim. 4.8. <HI>O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack &amp; suffer bunger, but they that seek the Lord, shall not want any good thing.</HI> Psal. 34.9, 10. Our Blessed Re∣deemer, speaking about <HI>food &amp; raiment.</HI> even the necessary supports of this present life, said, Mat. 6.33. <HI>But seek fust the Kingdom of God &amp; his righte∣ousness, &amp; all these things shall be added unto you.</HI></P>
